It seemed too sci-fi for me somehow. But, about 31 minutes into the movie, I started to get intrigued with the originality of the story. I realised the first 25 or so minutes really needed to be there to give the story some depth, so if I was to watch the movie again, I would not be bored watching those scenes. I couldn't believe the standards of the special effects for a 1979 movie, they are totally stunning and don't look fake at all. The acting is very good, the stress and the strain during the making of the movie truly pays off her with Sigourney's Weaver's stunning go-getter performance as Ripley. But, it's the most hats off that go to Ridley Scott, who directs the film with a positive side, bringing the potentially uninteresting to the horrifyingly memorable. Yes, Alien is horrifying. Most of the suspense comes from the cat Jones. Whenever he's on screen and the characters are trying to capture him, we know the alien is gonna come up and get someone gore-good. Even though you know that person on-screen is alien-baby bait, you still get a hell of a fright watching them get torn to pieces. In short: classic sci-fi horror.</p></body></html>

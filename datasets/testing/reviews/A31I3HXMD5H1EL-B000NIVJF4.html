<meta name="summary" content="Whitaker's Bravura Performance Makes Amin Film a Must!"></head><body><p>Chilling, funny, ruthless, yet childlike, Forest Whitaker's 'take' on Ugandan dictator Idi Amin is truly a career-defining role, and "The Last King of Scotland" is a film worthy of all the accolades it has received!<br /><br />Told through the experiences of a young, fictional Scot doctor (James McAvoy) who comes to Uganda on a lark, and is drawn into the charismatic Amin's inner circle, director Kevin Macdonald (making his feature film debut), allows the characters time to grow, giving the film a believability that another recent political thriller, the remake of "All the King's Men" sadly lacked.<br /><br />With the naivety of a smug, skirt-chasing youth, the doctor 'buys into' Amin's promise of wealth and an idyllic existence, and the dictator's combination of flattery, lofty goals, and boyish charm seems irresistible. But, gradually, paranoia, ruthlessness, capricious abuse of power, and lack of concern over human life would reveal a far darker Amin to both the doctor, and to the world, building to a climax both frightening and brutal.<br /><br />Whitaker is the 'glue' that holds the film together, and his ability to make Amin both repellent and charismatic provides one of the screen's most fascinating portrayals of this decade. He certainly deserved his Oscar!<br /><br />Perhaps the film is a bit simplistic on the issues (England's role in Ugandan politics and Amin's rise to power wavers between self-serving and altruistic), but as a thriller, it is very effective.<br /><br />A remarkable film, not to be missed!</p></body></html>

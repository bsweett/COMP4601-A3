<meta name="summary" content="Not quite hellish, but it'll do"></head><body><p>The Hughes brothers' From Hell is a movie about Jack The Ripper. And it isn't.  The movie's plot centers around the exploits and potential identity of Victorian England's mysterious knife-wielding prostitute killer, but its makers also try to shine a light on the darker aspects of that time and place, on the inevitable abuse of power, and on urban decay in general.  With a vicious murderer prowling the streets and leaving victims in pieces in his wake, there's a palpable sense of dread hanging over the proceedings, but even if Jack didn't make an appearance, there'd still be plenty to fear.  The 19th-century London of From Hell is a decidedly inhospitable place, racked by vice and crime, with plenty of unprincipled people willing to exploit the downtrodden for a buck (or, in this case, a pound).  In other words, it's sort of like any of dozens of urban ghettoes in 21-century America, except the appearances of those involved and the weapons of choice are different.<br /><br />I haven't read the Alan Moore graphic novel on which this movie was based, but the film version at least bears some pretty strong thematic parallels with Moore's V for Vendetta.  While that comic classic examined the dark underbelly of a fictional post-Cold War fascist England, From Hell attempts to strip away Victorian England's veneer of respectability to reveal a society awash in decadence, corruption, and prejudice, where power is lodged in decidedly undemocratic institutions and super-secret plots abound.  Some have written at some length about the movie's historical accuracy (or lack thereof), but it's really beside the point.  From Hell is, simply put, a movie, not a documentary, and it entertains more than well enough with what it has.  Plausibility issues aside, it looks great, with plenty of atmosphere and high style, some way cool visuals, truly painful death scenes, and liberal sprinklings of gore, which is just enough to get you to forgive the movie's haphazard pacing and occasional lapses into slasher-movie formula (even I could see some of the deaths coming a mile away).  It's also got Johhny Depp sporting a nifty British accent as Fred Abberline, the tortured detective trying to fight through the corridors of power to collar the slasher while he also fights his own addictions and the visions of death and mutilation that come to torment him in his sleep; and a bug-eyed Ian Holm hamming it up as a royal doctor with some murky motivations and an obvious God complex.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, you've got intrigue, nasty violence, some nice twists and turns in the plot as revelations start flying about halfway through, and another in a long line of excellent performances from Depp, not to mention a blindingly redheaded Heather Graham as perhaps the best-looking prostitute in all of London.  Sure, it's a bit shallow, and the plot doesn't always hum along as briskly as it should, but nothing's perfect, right?  Now to check out the book!</p></body></html>

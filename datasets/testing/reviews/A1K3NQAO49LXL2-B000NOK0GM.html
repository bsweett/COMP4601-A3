<meta name="summary" content="The Third Man - the last good movie ever made"></head><body><p>Voted the best British film of the 20th century, and regarded as the best film ever filmed in Vienna, The Third Man was the first of its kind in many ways: filmed in 1949, it was the first British film shot largely on location, it was also the first to focus on a single musician rather than an orchestra for its soundtrack.<br /><br />This Criterion Collection DVD is loaded with stuff. The first DVD comes with the full movie, plus three additional audio tracks: commmentary by Stephen Soderbergh and screennwriter Tony Gilroy, commentary by film scholar Dana Polan, and an abridged recording of Graham Greene's treatment of the story, to follow the whole film, as ready by actor Richard Clarke. There is also a video introduction by director Peter Bogdanovich. The second DVD has three documentaries, two radio plays based on The Third Man, photo data, the two alternate opening narrations, and a bunch of other stuff.<br /><br />Bogdanovich, in his intro, calls it the best "non-auteur" film ever made. Carol Reed is underrated, probably because his last films weren't so fantastic. Great black and white photography, the real star of the film, showing the wetness of the stones. Orson Welles had told Bogdanovich "Black and white is the actor's friend. Every performance is better in black and white. Name me one great performance in colour, I defy you." Peter Bogrdanovich agrees, as there is a lack of distraction by familiar colour themes, and the focus is on the drama instead. Orson Welles says it's the greatest "star part", in the way that he doesn't step onstage until late into the movie. Welles says he had no influence on the film, he only wrote the cuckoo clock speech. The film is called daring and fast cutting, and Bogdanovich recommends the In Search of the Third Man book. The documentary notes that Guy Hamilton, an assistant director on this film, went on to direct three Bond films, including "Goldfinger," and explains how Graham Greene went to Vienna for a few weeks, arriving on February 11th, 1948; on the last day he heard from the British intelligence about the penicillin scam, which gave him his idea for the plot. The UK intro to the film was narrated by Carol Reed himself ,the US intro by Joseph Cotton. "Oh, I want to tell you about Holly Martens." Walks under a ladder (why is it there? it's a prop, he's been scripted to walk under a ladder... it's foreshadowing!), talks to an old Austrian porter (famed Austrian actor Paul Horbiger, actually), who tells him that Harry Lime, the man he is looking for, is dead and either in Hell (he points up) or Heaven (he points down). This is a mixup of language, but it also shows how upside-down everything was in 1949.<br /><br />There is some great German dialogue by the famed Austrian actress Hedwig Bleibtreu: "Die Befreiung habe ich mich ganz anders vorgestellt." (I had imagined that the Liberation would be much different than this.) "Oh, danke, Sie sind wirklich das eingzige anst&auml;ndige Mensch hier." (Oh, thank you, you are really the only decent person here.) Crooked frames in some shots describe the chaos, sprial staircases hint at madness. Holly is bitten by a cockatiel, then there is the chase through the streets of Vienna. "You were born to be murdered" Callahan says to Holly. Extra content - director Reed and producer David Selznik had disagreed over Welles, who was Reed's choice but who Selznik considered box office poison. There were three units - day, night, and sewer, and the on-site production continued over seven weeks. Director Carol Reed chewed benzedrine in order to be able to direct all three units, nearly 24 hours a day. Reed cut a Vienna at night series, but couldn't use it because he believed that every shot must be functional (where is it? why isn't it in the Criterion Collection version of the film?!?!). Since Welles came late, many shots were done with stand-ins; and since he was appalled at the filth of the sewer, a sound stage was built at Shepperton Studios to recreate parts of the sewer system. Austrian actors were flown in for this too. In the studio at the same time were Cary Grant, Montgomery Clift and Ann Sheridan. Viennese musician of note Anton Karas played at the welcome reception for the film actors when they came to shoot on location, Carol Reed was taken by the instrument he played at the recdption, the hitherto-unknown (to him, and to British and American actors and directors) zither, and recorded hours of his music in his hotel room. When it was decided to use the music in the intro, it was unprecedented because film scores were always orchestral and didn't focus on solo instruments.<br /><br />There is archival material, such as the press pack, and the original trailers: (man's hard voice) "Hated by 1,000 men", (woman's desirous voice) "desired by one woman." (man's voice) "The Third Man - hanging's too good for him"; (woman's voice, desirous) "Nothing's too good for The Third Man". Crazy titles like "He'll have you in a dither with his zither" (ugh!!!). Then there are the documentaries: Shadowing The Third Man is a documentary that shows long snatches of the film and moves along slowly, as it would if it was sold to fill a 90-minute space but had less than 10 minutes of real content; the film provides at the start some Zeitgeist, it seems that 270,000 men were killed in World War II, and 500,000 were in prisoner of war camps or in exile, so women were largely responsible for rebuilding the city. Reed and Selznik argued over Anita Valli's clothes, Selznik thought that they were too dowdy for a big star. Paul Horbiger couldn't speak a word of English and had to be coached by phoneticists. Hedwig Bleibtreu, the landlady, was 82 at the time, but she always showed up on time for filming, never arrived late. A now-adult Hansi talked about his role, how he was just playing himself. The documentary shows cool morphs from modern Vienna to scenes form the movie, such as the cat scene, and the 300 km of sewers. The Ferris Wheel was deep in the Soviet zone, a sort of propaganda set to display the wonders of communism. "Harry is in only 10% of the film, the love triangle is only complete for a sort scene. Welles wondering "how anyone can work in these conditions. Sewer police were mobilised for the shoot. In some scenes we can see Orson Welles' breath in the cold weather, these were the scenes filmed on site. Also, we learn that those are Carol Reed's fingers poking through the grill to demonstrate some great non-verbal dialogue. There are also four very important lines cut from the end of the film:<br /><br />  - Calloway - What happened?<br />  - Martins - I couldn't bear his pain, I put a bullet through him."<br />  - Calloway - We'll forget that bit."<br />  - Martins - I never shall!"<br /><br />The dialogue, however, is replaced by Harry's nod, and some of the body language between Cotton and Welles (and Trevor Howard, in a few seconds) is just what it is.<br />The script called for, and the crew filmed, a scene where Anna was kidnapped by the Soviets, but this was cut from the film to make it less political (I almost wish that they had included it - there was so much noise about her passport and the Russian authorities, it was irritating and irrelevant otherwise. On the other hand, it also never got boring.<br /><br />"The Third Man theme" was a #1 hit on the Variety Charts in the week ending June 10th, 1950. Hard as it to imagine, for a brief period the world was in the grips of zither mania!! But as a result of the European success of The Third Man, Korda kidnapped the negative, and the relationship with him and David Selznik deteriorated.<br /><br />There are two tracks of commentary on the DVD, one by filmmakers Stephen Soderbergh and Tony Gilroy that is not very interesting at all, but film scholar Dana Polan offers a strong commentary throughout the film, and we learn a few things from him, as well as the film theory stuff about the type of film that it was, a "binary film" that provided tension between values, identity, moralising, as well as between the old world and the new, the artistic world of European film and the commercial world of Hollywood, which is already suggested in the credits. Polan describes Holly as a brash, cocky American who's a bit slow on the uptake and a prime example of the ugly American abroad (Soderbergh and Gilroy are harder on his character, calling him a blank nothing who never really succeeds at anything of his own accord - he's a bit of a Jeffrey "the Dude" Lebowski in that regard). For the early scene of Martins walking under a ladder, it depicts him walking of his own volition right into a world of bad luck. Holly was supposed to be a British cahracter, but David O. Selznik insisted on an American. Bernard Lee, who was M in the Bond films, plays Seargent Paine. Parallels exist in the film with the formula westerns that Holly writes, that whole "sherrif telling the stranger to be on the next stagecoach out of town if he knows what's good for him."<br /><br />The packaging of the DVD is stunning also - the first disc shows the full ferris wheel on its round shape, while the second disc shows the mesh of cables and supports seen from inside a cabin, symbolically depicting the object from the outside (the full movie) and its inner workings (the documentaries about the movie and its dissection).<br /><br />"Who Was The Third Man" is a documentary in German by Austria's Wien-Kanal, it starts with a jazz intro with the theme song. It gave more zeitgeist than other films, explaining that on March 10th, 1950, the film opened in Vienna, and 120,000 went to see it in following weeks, curious to see how Vienna would be portrayed in an American film.<br /><br />Someone made the comment that the grave where they filmed Harry's multiple burials is not occupied by someone called Gr&uuml;n, which is German for "green"; Lime also means green. There are other similarities - Greene stayed at the Hotel Sacher, like the writer Holly Martins does, and he was also in 1948 to give a talk at the British Council, like Martins also is. Stylistically, the documentary moves from colour to black and white, as if to achieve some goal. But the documentary does explain that Greene knew British spymaster and traitor Kim Philby, who was in the area at the time, and how Greene rubbed shoulders with master spies, and after he had rubbed shoulders with these people, had heard the racketeering tales. There's footage of Paul Horbinger talking about the film in 1979, and more discussion about the soundtrack. Reed wanted a non-virtuoso to do the zither soundtrack, wanted it to sound broken and cracked, like Vienna itself. For the first recording, all that Anton Karas did was a first take, and for the first recording all he got was a blue suit, he was happy. Later he became a millionaire, selling 40 million records, and opened up his own club. Couldn't read or write music, though, it seems.<br /><br />The sewers: there were 7,500 km when the documentary was made in 2007, but in 1949 when the film was made there were 3,000 km). Sewer shooting needed four weeks. Welles' body double was a butcher Otto Schusser. Then there is a nice final shot of the long walk - the host walks down the side as they re-produce the original film's final shot.<br /><br />Another documentary is Graham Greene: The Hunted Man, A 1968 profile of Graham Greene with Christopher Burnstall, which touches on nearly all of his work up until that point except for "The Third Man". Funny. Starts off with Greene's passport, and its many stamps, all from countries that we know he's visited because his stories are set there. Then there is the discussion - which Greene only allowed to be audio-taped, he didn't want to become a non-serious writer who becomes a TV comedian - that touches upon so many topics, such as Greene's life, and where he felt hunted: Indochina, during the London Blitz, and by the Catholic faith. "Human nature is not black and white, but black and gray." The conversation takes place on the Orient Express from Paris to Istanbul, traveling through Switzerland, Italy, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey. Three days, two nights, with no restaurant car. Feels a writer should not be recognised, likes borders, but never wants to stay in any one place too long or let the ice get too thick. Used to play Russian roulette, but one bullet in a chamber was too few for him, he lost the kick, so he put in two bullets! He met the pope, who had read The Power And The Glory and was surprised that his books were black listed. "Some parts of your books will always offend some Catholics; you shouldn't pay any attention to them whatsovever." Talks about smoking opium in Indochina, but that he'd only have 10 pipes on three occasions in a given week and that real addicts would have 50-250 pipes a day. Smoking in pairs is social, and anyone could get a full night's sleep with any amount. How wonderful.<br /><br />There are brief interviews with students: "I don't think that any of Greene's heroes are heroes; they're just ordinary people who've gotten themselves in a mess."<br /><br />  - The war does spoil everything,doesn't it?<br />  - it gives the young men a chance.<br /><br />Greene became a Catholic before his first book, and it was a secret for 10 years, but by Brighton Rock it was obvious. Never wrote about Nazi Germany, Hitler was a boring subject. Liked gossip, would listen to what women, priests, lawyers and doctors had to say to each other. Did psychoanalysis, needed to keep a dream diary. Used to write 500 words a day, later came down to 200 words a day. Continues to write, even when it is going badly. Beginning and ending of a project is clear in its framework, then there's the mountain range in between the two and a hope for surprises.<br /><br />Extras: Anton Karas in London, a snippet, beautiful, hypnotic. A feature on the sewer brigade, which polices the sewers. "There are strange jobs in this world, but surely none so weird as these police of the underworld." "The Lives of Harry Lime: A Ticket To Tangiers." Radio play, broadcast August 24th 1951, from a soundplay written by Orson Welles. "Harry Lime had many lives. How do I know? My name is Harry Lime." Answered ad in Paris, went to Tangiers, fell in love, got trapped into a strange game, got attcked, turned it all around, and beat the crazy rap. Wild, man, wild...</p></body></html>

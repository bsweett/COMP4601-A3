<meta name="summary" content="Easily the Best Trek Film"></head><body><p>The most literate and character-driven Star Trek film, this second outing takes the series to a level not yet repeated. An aging Kirk goes head-to-head with old nemesis Khan (played with convincing wrath by Montalban) in a multi-layered story that ultimately forces him to confront his own flaws and mortality. Moreover, secondary characters, particularly Spock, shine in moments that may actually bring a tear to your eye. Superb special effects, a suitably nautical score by Horner, a wonderfully subdued tone marred only by occasional corniness, and a bravo performance by Shatner make this one a must-see. Although the DVD lacks extra scenes (strangely, shown on TV several times), the widescreen view allows your eye to savor details, even director Meyer's typical anachronistic ones (check out the "no smoking" sign and obvious 20th-century fire extinguishers.).</p></body></html>

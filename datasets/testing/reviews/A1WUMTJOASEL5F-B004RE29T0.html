<meta name="summary" content="Forbidden Planet"></head><body><p>The first series of ALIEN is by far a sci-fi classic tale. A small troup of intergalatic travelers on return route from an assignment space mission, have intercepted a beacon signal, and the spaceship called Mother has decided to investigate. This leaves the tired homesick crew with an added adventure horror tale of becoming face to face with pure alien terror. One by one, they meet their doomed fates, and it is Ripley, played with perfect casting of Sigourney Weaver, to make it back home safely.<br /><br />Sigourney has found her niche in the hollywood books of science fiction movies, as one of the most heroic, and startling savvy women of all time. Despite her incredible odds of survival, she personally puts together all the formulative pieces of the jigsaw puzzle concerning the reason behind carrying the alien being on the ship.<br /><br />Excellent effects, and grand atmospheric sound track make this one the ultimate terror from outer space.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THIS MOVIE IS AN AMAZING SCI-FI THRILLER."></head><body><p>The first installment in the &quot;Alien&quot; series, is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made; the claustrophobic environment of the Nostromo spaceship and an almost invincible Alien creature victimizing one by one the other passengers, make this film a must-see for any movie fan. Even if &quot;Alien&quot; was released in 1979, this sci-fi film remains as one of the best thrillers that you can find; by the time when Sigourney Weaver (Lt. Ripley) meets the monster for the final battle, your attention will be focused only in the screen.<br /><br /> As Ellen Ripley, Sigourney Weaver set the standard for the movie heroines to come, and the rest of the cast made a great job as well. The film hasn't dated a bit, it still feels futuristic and disturbing every time you see it. If you are sick of teenager slashing flicks that instead of making you feel horror, make you laugh out loud, check this one, &quot;Alien&quot; is a great film.</p></body></html>

The story is interesting, it's exceptionally well written, and  William Shatner looks mighty fine.<p>What makes this film special and worth 5 stars, is my all time favorite screen villain, Khan. Ricardo Montalban is absolutely fabulous. There are subtleties in this performance that make it a joy to watch repeatedly...his expressive, beautiful hands, his amazing voice...&quot;Let them eat static !&quot;. This is not a one-dimensional character. He is smooth, evil, and even sympathetic at times. What a stupendous bad guy !<p>I must add a personal anecdote about the man behind this marvelous villain. Mr. Montalban is the kindest, most giving soul I have ever met. I'm sure he had no idea, nearly 40 years ago, what a huge impact his humanity had on my life. Thank you Ricardo, for being a guardian angel on this earth.</p></body></html>

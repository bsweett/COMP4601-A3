At a concert I saw, he showed scenes from Fulci films and such on his big screen, and I thought that was the coolest part of the concert.  Well, for his first film, he certainly tried to make it all he could.  If you're looking for another I Know What You Did Last Summer, you'd better hightail it outta the theater, coz Zombie has made the kind of film that he enjoys;  The kind of gruesome, schlocky film that us horror fanatics have grown up with and loved.  Because of this, many people just aren't gonna like this film, but that's okay, coz I'm sure Zombie himself knows that this movie is going to appeal only to a certain crowd of people:  People like him.....and myself.  There's no message, no moral play, no real scares for that matter.  The movie's just messed up and gruesome.  It's got a great cast.  Zombie didn't take the easy route and rely on young, fresh star power for the film's success.  He uses veteran, cult horror actors like Sid Haig, Karen Black and Bill Moseley(and if you don't know who they are, shame on you!).  The plot "borrows" very heavily from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre films(Part 2 had Bill Moseley in pretty much the same role, only crazier!) and Spiderbaby(which had Sid Haig).  Zombie had to compromise to get this picture out by cutting out many scenes deemed too gruesome and disturbing for our fragile little minds.  This would have awarded him an NC-17 rating-THE TRUE MOVIE KILLER.  Well, I went to see the trimmed version to support Zombie and hopefully get him some cash back to release the version he wants on dvd.  Plus, I wanted a taste of what the film was gonna be like.  I'm not sure if it was as good as everything I've read in the last few years, but I really admire the ballsy move of making this, knowing he was going to have alot of people saying, "Boy, that was terrible!"  My only complaint is the little artsy touches he throws in, in the form of Oliver Stone-esque flashes of stock footage and grainy 16mm film.  It looks too much like he's trying to make a rock video or he's trying out all the cool little toys on his camera.  That's a small complaint though, and you get used to it pretty fast.  So, if you wanna experience a cinematic time warp that'll take make you feel like you're back at the drive-in or your local run down/small/yucky/sticky/bad acoustics theater(the kind you could actually smoke in, GOD FORBID), House Of 1000 Corpses is the best real horror flick to come along in a long time......and I doubt we'll see one like this again for quite some time.  So, get off your behind and see it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Thinking man's thriller"></head><body><p>Sure, there's plenty of blood and gore and violence and bullets and guns in this unlikely Hollywood thriller. But at least the script is intelligent, and the plot twists are enough to keep you interested. Few are the recent films which I can watch without long pauses due to extreme boredom. This was not one of those. Kevin Costner plays against type here as an extreme bad guy with a real voice in his head, played by William Hurt. These two hadn't worked together since "The Big Chill," and they succeed. Demi Moore is finally looking a bit jowly in certain shots, but she still does well as the wily and wealthy detective, even though she doesn't solve the crime. Well done.</p></body></html>

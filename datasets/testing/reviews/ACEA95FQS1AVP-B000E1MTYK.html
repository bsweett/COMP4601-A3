<meta name="summary" content="Awesome movie--excellent DVD."></head><body><p>I thought this was the best of the 4 films. My only gripe is that they left out the part where Hermione captures Rita Skeeter as a bug after learning she's an animagus. Normally, I don't mind the editing in order to make the movie a reasonable length, but without that ending Skeeter was just an annoyance in the movie. Overall though, it was excellent.<br /><br />The deluxe 2 disk DVD is also well done. The featurettes have greatly improved over previous editions. The "Conversations with the Cast" was interesting and the three stars are well spoken and very funny at times. The piece on the Yule Ball expanded on the actors learning to dance, the set, and the scenes added that weren't in the book. And I, for one, am grateful I didn't have to "work" through some game to see the deleted scenes. The extras are worth the additional money versus the single disk edition.</p></body></html>

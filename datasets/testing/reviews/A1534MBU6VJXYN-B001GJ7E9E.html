<meta name="summary" content="Exceeded My Expectations Greatly"></head><body><p>I've never been afraid to admit I was never that big of a fan of Brad Pitt. Other than "True Romance", I've never been taken by any of his films. And also, I've never been particulary taken by the lovely Angelina Jolie. So when my dad brought home "Mr. & Mrs. Smith", I thought, "oh great, the last movie I want to see". But, I decided to watch it say.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was blown away.<br /><br />This is truly a great film. It won't be an Oscar contender, but who cares. Most reviewers have already gone into plot details, so I'll just say this. This film is really fun. Great action, a lot of laughs. The plot is actually well written for what is meant to be a mindless action film.<br /><br />The two stars were great. I find myself able to tolerate them more now that I've seen the movie. Also, it was great to see good ol' Vince Vaughn pop up as Eddie, John Smith's (Brad's character) best friend.<br /><br />Bottom line: highly recommended. See it as soon as possible.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Predictable melange of better films & stories isn't as bad as it could have been"></head><body><p>** SPOILERS ahead, in case you can't predict the whole movie anyway **<br /><br />Another entry in my neverending quest to watch every last fantasy and science fiction film ever, no matter how bad,  ERAGON - based on the supposedly awful first novel by the then-teenage Christopher Paolini - is surprisingly enough not nearly as terrible as I expected it to be.  It kept me awake at least, and only had one or two actually cringe-inducing moments; I suspect that, as much as I'm bored with generic stuff like this, I'm also more able to tolerate some of it simply because I like the Tolkien-influenced genre tropes to begin with; those who don't have patience for stuff like farmboys-becoming-chosen-heroes for no reason whatsoever other than that's what the story says will probably be less generous than I am, and perhaps be annoyed that they've seen it all before even if they haven't seen it nearly as many times as I have. There's something to be said for being a genre specialist I suppose.<br /><br />But generic this story is, unfortunately, and ultimately its greatest sin is dullness and predictability. Let's see how few words it takes to sum it up: years ago there were dragons and dragonriders that protected the land of Alaga?sia, until one day one of them went all bad and decided to kill all of his buddies and take power over the land for himself. His name was John Malkovich, oops I mean Galbatorix (Paolini's strength, if he has one, is not in naming). But one egg somehow got saved (this is never explained) and eventually a young woman guarding it, Arya (Sienna Guillory) saves it from the king's evil magician Durza (Robert Carlyle) by sending it to Eragon (Ed Speleers) a young farmboy. The king soon realizes what's up and sends people to kill the kid, but not before the dragon hatches. Soon the town is aflame and Eragon has to escape with his dragon Saphira (voiced by Rachel Weisz) - which grows to adulthood instantly in one of those "magic" moments. They're helped out by an older, wise man named Obi-Wan Kenobi, sorry I mean Brom (Jeremy Irons, who also narrates the opening few minutes) who knows - well, you'll figure it out. They have to get to the Vardens, the people who resist the king, but Eragon gets a psychic message from the imprisoned Arya and decides to go save her; Brom of course counsels against this but Eragon being headstrong goes ahead, penetrates the Death Star and saves Princess Leia with the help of the brash young Han Solo, but not before Brom sacrifices himself in the fight against Darth Vader...oops, there I did it again. Well, you get the idea. And at the end there's a spectacular battle as the dragon has learned to breathe fire and Eragon gets to avenge Brom, yadda yadda yadda.<br /><br />What saves this from being really horrible is the acting of Irons and Weisz, who really put a lot of heart and seriousness into this silly stuff, some nice photography that actually has a decent range of light and color palettes compared to the typical modern action film (courtesy of DP Hugh Jackson), and relatively competent and brisk direction on the part of first-time feature director Fangmeier. Yes, the 104 minutes gloss over an awful lot of stuff that must have been developed better (well one hopes so) in the book, but this being so utterly lacking in originality only the stupidest or youngest and least experienced of viewers are going to really have trouble knowing what's going on or filling in the blanks. Even really idiotic scenes like Irons' reappearance in the magician's stronghold just in time to save Eragon by taking a spear for him can probably be explained through "magic" which we gradually learn lets dragonriders do just about anything. How convenient.<br /><br />So I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone, but if you're in the mood for completely undemanding, mindless fantasy there's plenty out there that is much worse, and I'm happy to give it two stars; in a really generous mood it could even push for a third.</p></body></html>

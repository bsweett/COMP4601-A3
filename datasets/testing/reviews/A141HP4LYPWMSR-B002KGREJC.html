<meta name="summary" content=""I'm Still In" ~ Dealing With Issues Beyond One's Maturity Level"></head><body><p>For all those out there who think they've seen everything when it comes to teenage "coming of age" films I say think again. The recently released DVD `Juno' takes into account all the usual high school dramas one has come to expect from this genre of film but moves swiftly beyond those over explored storylines to catapult the audience into the interior world of Juno (Ellen Page), an attractive but rather "different" young girl who discovers she's become pregnant by Paulie (Michael Cera) her best friend and secret love of her life.<br /><br />Following Juno on her external journey through personal crisis on the road to adulthood  the viewer is also privy to Juno's internal thought processes thus offering the audience an invitation to establish an intimate relationship with the main character of the film. With such a superb performance by Ellen Page this intimacy is immediate and thoroughly satisfying.<br /><br />`Juno' explores the issues of young love and teenage pregnancy with a clever combination of wit and wisdom, sarcasm and poignancy all delivered within the parameters of one of the quirkiest storylines and cleverest scripts in recent memory. Ellen Page was amazing in the role of the firey but immensely loveable Juno. While the entire cast is wonderful, it's Ellen's performance that will stay with you. If that weren't enough, wait to you hear the incredible soundtrack!<br /><br />My Rating: -4 1/2 Stars-.</p></body></html>

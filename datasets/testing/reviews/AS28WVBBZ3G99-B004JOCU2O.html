<meta name="summary" content="Exciting. Suspenseful. Fun."></head><body><p>UNSTOPPABLE is a thriller about a runaway freight train hauling lethal cargo, hurtling toward unspeakable tragedy. The action starts a few minutes into the film and doesn't stop for 1 hour and 38 minutes later when you finally exhale.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is classic in the film; a twenty-eight year veteran engineer with a quick wit and cool hand on the throttle. There are some well-worn themes; hard-working union members against incompetent corporate thugs; rough-hewn rail hands vs the mean old railroad man; know-nothing rookies vs experienced veterans; misunderstood husband with a quick temper but good heart; etc. Even these are not so tedious as to prevent enjoyment.<br /><br />It is interesting that a runaway train story, replete with cliche' screenwriting and threadbare liberal stereotypes could be so much fun. It is an hour and a half of non-stop entertainment; groans, laughs, intakes of breath, raucous cheering. This is a suspenseful action film, fraught with tension and excitement. You may find yourself on the edge of your seat and cheering aloud.<br /><br />PG-13 for strong language.</p></body></html>

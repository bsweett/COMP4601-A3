<meta name="summary" content="Kilmer in search for a girl"></head><body><p>Val Kilmer (The Salton Sea, The Doors) plays a man on a mission, or as the title puts it well, Spartan. The Presidents daughter is supposedly missing, either she was sold into slavery or she did it herself. Kilmer and crew set out in search and things dont seem what they appear to be. Some of this movie doesnt make as bit of sense as others but it adds up to a good performance by Kilmer as always. Along for the ride is Derek Luke (Biker Boyz, Antwone Fisher), Ed O'Neill (Tv's Married With Children, The Bone Collector), Aaron Stanford (Tadpole, X2: X-Men United), Tia Texada (Bait, Tv's Third Watch) and William H. Macy (The Cooler, Pleasantville). Both Macy and O'Neill are in small and wasted roles and it looks like they had fun shooting up Luke a lot. The end with the airport seems forced, dont you think? Directed by David Mamet (Heist)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="MAD FOR MADELEINE"></head><body><p>In viewing VERTIGO, one must admit the supreme directorial abilities of Alfred Hitchcock.  Here we have a typical Hitchcock movie, with its long silent following sequences, which were much imitated later by Brian de Palma in BODY DOUBLE and DRESSED TO KILL, particularly.  Hitch, however, mastered this technique and let us feel the hopeless frustration of Scottie Ferguson and the unquestionable mysterious attraction to the perhaps mad Madeleine.  Having seen this classic several times, one can see how gullible Scottie is, and how devious Madeliene has been, but even in multiple viewings, one can't help but wish the two could come together.<br /><br />The performances of the three leads is impeccable.  Remember, up until this time, we've seen James Stewart mostly as a heroic figure, a man of principles and high moral standards.  This time, Jimmy plays a man who becomes totally obsessed with Madeleine, to the point of having an affair with his best friend's wife.  His descent into this obsession and ultimately a nervous breakdown is very disturbing and his final scene in the church tower isn't like anything we've seen Jimmy do.  It's a brilliant performance, and the highlight of his magnificent career.  The beautiful Kim Novak is also in top form as the duplicitous Madeleine/Judy.  It would be easy to toss her performance off as just a pretty face, but in looking at her performance, one can see how she goes from the smooth, silky Madeleine to the earthy, desperate Judy.  Her realization that Scottie is trying to turn her into Madeleine shows her range in the desperation of not wanting to be Madeleine, but needing Scottie.  And let's not overlook the wonders of Barbara Bel Geddes as the hopelessly in love with Scottie Midge.  Miss Bel Geddes takes the sweet girl next door to its supreme limits, and when she realizes she will never have Scottie, her slow walk down the hospital corridor is heartbreaking.  Trivia note:  Miss Bel Geddes played Miss Ellie on DALLAS for years and when her health failed, the role was taken over by fellow Hitchcock femme fatale Eva Marie Saint.<br /><br />VERTIGO is a spellbinding, hypnotic and disturbing film, filled with surreal images and an ending that still manages to chill.  One of, if not, the best of Hitchcock's movies.</p></body></html>

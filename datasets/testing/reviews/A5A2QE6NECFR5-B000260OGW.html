If you have the patience, however, the final rewards are many. The performances are uniformly good, with Costner, Duvall and Bening excellent as usual, and many fine supporting actor contributions, including Michael Gambon as the bad guy (Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series!)and Michael Jeter as a helpful townsman. It is fascinating to compare Costner's grizzled, disillusioned Civil War veteran here to the sparkling gunfighter he portrayed as a young man in "Silverado." The cinematography is glorious in this one, but the script wasn't quite tight enough to make this a masterpiece. The climax, however, is one of the best wild West gunfights I've ever seen, and at age 62, I've seen scores of them on screen. Give this movie's first 40 minutes the benefit of the doubt, and the final 100 minutes will reward you. As a bonus, Duvall rips off half-a-dozen hilarious lines, and a dozen wise ones, winning your heart and mind as an old cowhand who has learned life's lessons well.</p></body></html>

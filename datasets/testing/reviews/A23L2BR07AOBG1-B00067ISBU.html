<meta name="summary" content="Good film, but doesn't excell"></head><body><p>Ron Perlman effectively carries this film when the plot mechanics bog down the story. He's funny and violent and vulnerable, perfect.  If he doesn't work, the film doesn't. One thing that I disagree with about the film is that it shouldn't be rated pg-13.  There's a lot a violent and gruesome content in this film and it's combined with occultic themes, kids shouldn't be seeing this stuff, that's all.  I had the same quibbles with the Lord of the Rings, they pushes R rated violence into the pg-13 territory because they wanted to make their money back. Enough of my puritanical rant, I just feel that this movie earns the R and doesn't end up getting it, that's all. By the way, kudos to Jeffrey Tambor, who plays a character who you don't like and is still OK to like at the end because he's such a obnoxious dufus. To all who've seen it, I hope you stuck around for the credits to catch a little bit more of him.</p></body></html>

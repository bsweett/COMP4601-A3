<meta name="summary" content="A Walloping Good Movie!"></head><body><p>COLLATERAL is simply excellent entertainment.  The direction by Michael Mann is tense, highly nuanced, and achieves superb performances from of his excellent cast.  The plot line is fairly straight forward: hired assassin (Tom Cruise in a role that comes close to his fine acting turn in A FEW GOOD MEN, which is praise indeed) engages a good guy cabbie (Jamie Foxx in an outstanding performance! - watch the nominations....) to privately transport him around Los Angeles for six night hours while he murders witnesses to a trial.  More than that you need not know: the movie is basically a duet for these two actors with excellent support form incidental players the likes of Mark Ruffalo, Jada Pinkett Smith, and the always fascinatingly gifted Javier Bardem, etc.  The camera work takes us places Los Angeles hides under smog during the day, skylines at night so magnificent you'd think they were New York.  But then there is also the grit, the smarmy side of all sectors of LA, and Mann and his cinematographer capture it all with relish.  The accompanying musical score is apropos and builds tension.  But in the end it is the tour de force of the interaction between Foxx and Cruise that makes this movie more than just another summer action flick.  It deserves repeated watching!</p></body></html>

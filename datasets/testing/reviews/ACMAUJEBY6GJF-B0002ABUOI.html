<meta name="summary" content="The worst movie made since..."></head><body><p>...Van Helsing, though other than their makers shared lack of talent and the "meaninglessness" of the so-called story behind them, well, I would not compare them. And I WILL NOT waste any more time on this movie writing a long review on how awful it is made, and what a pointless movie "Dawn of the Dead" is! It is not even bad-funny if you get my meaning, you suffer yourself through this movie -and in the end you feel like one of those damn zombies, I mean: I wasn't expecting intelliguence from a movie with this name, but I expected to be scared, or at least entertained. No, it is just bad -and that's all!<br /><br />The acting is unbelievable (in that negative sence of course), and the lines they throw at eachother must be written by a violent teenager from Harlem or something).<br /><br />Yes, in fact -I'm left with the impression that a kid (or many kids) has come up with the idea of making this sorry excuse for an action-horror-splatter-movie. What a mess, and what a waste!<br /><br />Rent first, do not buy -and watch Braindead or Bad Taste instead (and if you already have, "Dawn of the Dead" isn't anything like those -if again you liked them...).<br /><br />Hated it! UNBELIEVABLE BAD!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Quick note on Hot Wheels offer."></head><body><p>Back to the Future is a great comedy/sci-fi(ish) trilogy and there are plenty of reviews to cover that. I'm here to mention the special Hot Wheels Delorean package. The toy is pretty neat and hits all the respectable details enough for even a collector to enjoy. Just keep in mind this isn't an exclusive offer or limited edition. My four year old son got the exact same car from a $1 crate at our local Kroger. I'm kind proud he picked that car out of the dozen or so other options. Anyway you should probably look at a cheaper edition and hunt your local toy store for the car. Should save you a pretty penny.</p></body></html>

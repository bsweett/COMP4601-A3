<meta name="summary" content="Moral:Wear a Flak Jacket When Taking Stray Calls!"></head><body><p>Stu Shepard lives an extremely complex life while pretending to be somebody important. Feigning interest in people while attempting to use them, juggling a wife and a girlfriend while hoping to taste the best of both worlds, and portraying himself as something better than a publicist takes a lot of time and finagling. But stepping into that phone booth he's used time and again and answering an incoming call makes his situation all the more difficult to adjust to - and live through.  <p>While watching Phone Booth, I - like the man in the booth - went through mood swings of my own. First I thought it was going to be a nice ride, liking the introduction of Stu and the things added to him that seemed to scream "sniper bait." The ego, the flash, and all the pretty words seem to state that someone might want to take revenge on our main character. Colin Ferrel actually seemed to fit the role, too, delivering a nice punch as a jerk, and I kept thinking that he would make a nice "victim" in a game that was certainly going to try to turn the tables on him. Then came the phone booth and the call, leading into the little games and all the hoops he was told to jump through, and I found myself going from a mindset of "that's not a good situaiton to be in" to wondering where this was going. Granted, the torment was fun at first and the research the shooter did was commendable. Still, the conversation and the deconstruction seemed almost pointless as everything moved forward. There was a lot of shouting, some "do what I say or else" comments spoken, but the progression didn't seem to have any really meaning attached. And next came the torment that just kept going on and on and on, and I kept wondering when it would finally end and let me out of the booth as well. Some situations that should have been tense showcased themselves more than once as they hoped for dramatic build and I found myself fighting the urge to fast forward some of those supposed tense scenarios. And when it ended I thought that the reasoning behind it was cold-blooded and made up for the stringing along effect I sat through, but the movie itself went on a tad too long and was hard to forgive. <p>This isn't to say that I found the movie without any substance and vacant, because there were some decent portions playing within the whole. The message within the bottle was a disturbing, sure, and the Sutherland as the bad guy gave him a bit of appeal. When it came down to presentation, however, the movie was nothing more than views from a scope, a phone booth, and some snapshots of a police roadblock. Development of the "why" involved wasn't really there, nor was the movie ever really focused on anyone save for the man in the booth. We only heard Sutherland's voice until the very end and didn't see anything to say who he was or why he did things, and Forest Whitaker served only as a way to try and bring conclusion and to play a clich&eacute; police role. So, would that mean I'm calling this a waste of time? No, I wouldn't go that far. I'd simply advise against seeing it unless you need something to watch, boredom and a lack of better movies to watch playing a key role therein, and can't keep your curiosity at bay.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Los Angeles Job..."></head><body><p>Resurrect the plot of a 1969 Michael Caine movie, recast it with a collection of sharp young actors, and move the action to Los Angeles.  The result is 2003's "The Italian Job", a fast-paced and enjoyable action thriller.<br /><br />The movie opens with an elaborately-planned heist in Venice, Italy.  A crack crew of thieves goes to Mission: Impossible-like lengths to extract a fortune in gold from a canal-side mansion and escape to the Italian Alps.  There, one of the crew (Edward Norton as a slick and selfish bad guy) betrays the rest, killing the aging master thief (cameo by Donald Sutherland), stealing the gold, and scattering the crew.<br /><br />Fast forward a year.  Charlie Croker, the master thief's protege (played with cool precision by Mark Wahlberg), locates the traitor, living in a fortress mansion in Los Angeles.  He reassembles the team to steal the gold back.  This effort is the heart of the film, as Charlie's team plots their entrance into the mansion and their escape afterward.  The highlight of the movie is a nail-biting chase across Los Angeles, with Charlie's team in specially modified Mini-Coopers and their former teammate in hot pursuit by helicopter.  A tense final confrontation at the Los Angeles train station reveals a few final plot twists.<br /><br />Charlize Theron does an excellent turn as Croker's safe-cracking love interest.  Seth Green is the team's computer whiz and comic relief.  Jason Statham is the team's hunky automotive expert. Mos Def and Franky G have nice supporting roles as additional muscle recruited for the Los Angeles job.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as an entertaining action thriller.  This DVD version includes some nice extras on the making of the movie, to include how the amazing Mini-Cooper stunts were performed.</p></body></html>

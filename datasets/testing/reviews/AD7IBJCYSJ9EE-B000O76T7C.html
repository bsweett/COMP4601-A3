<meta name="summary" content="Chilling space-tale still going strong after 25 years."></head><body><p>Alien is a top notch sci-fi film, filled with suspense.<br /><br /> It's about this mining ship with seven people in it:Dallas, Ripley, Ash, Parker, Lambert, Brett, and Kane. Returning to Earth, they recieve an SOS coming from a distant planet. One of the crew members finds some eggs. A creature from the egg latches on to him, and gets in a coma, later, the alien is removed. But, the Alien planted an embryo in the guy, and soon another alien pops out of his stomach, [pretty gross] and runs off. Noe the remaining crew must find the alien fast, or it might evolve. And the alien will kill anything in its path...<br /><br /> Alien is a masterpice Suspense, action, terror, and survival all rolled into one! You have to see this movie before you die. It rocks!</p></body></html>

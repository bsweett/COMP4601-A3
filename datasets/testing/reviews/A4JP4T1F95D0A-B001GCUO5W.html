I had hoped that maybe it was a big swerve and the ending would change things up since it seemed so obvious, but that didn't happen.  I do like Scorsese's direction and the score reminded me of "The Shining".  I can't fault much with the film other than the story itself.  Well made movie, just a bit of a let down for me.</p></body></html>

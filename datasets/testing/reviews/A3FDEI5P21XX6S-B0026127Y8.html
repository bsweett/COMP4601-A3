<meta name="summary" content="Great film, great Blu Ray, 5+ stars"></head><body><p>This title won me over with one of the best guilty pleasures I have encountered on a Blu - and it was an awesome film.<br /><br />I have read a plethora of reviews covering the story, and honestly it is simple enough in that of a dad looking to rescue his kidnapped daughter. The quality of the Blu had loads of opportunity to fail with all of the close quarter hand to hand and nighttime action, but they did quite well. There is some hints of grain here and there but it seemed relevant to the scene. Otherwise - a nice transfer. The DTS was superb and bolstered Liam's resounding voice properly. The outer channels did not get used as much as I had hoped, but fortunately they did not score this film where voices and action get drowned out.<br /><br />Now for the fun stuff. I watched the extended version (1:33:25 vs. 1:30:55 on the rated) and turned on the Black Ops option. Two things occur here: 1. A semi-decent trivia track that provides some relevant facts regarding human trafficking and 2. A body count meter, time remaining watch (the 96 hour window) and a miles traveled listing. I loved it. This option finally answered those nagging questions (in an action movie like this) of did that bad guy really die or not, or is he coming back to wreak havoc. For instance, when a car crashes did it really kill every bad guy in the back seat or are they coming back in the next scene - killed meter clicks up 2 spots - answer is no. Spoiler: final count 33 dead, 13 wounded, 12K miles traveled in exactly 96 hours. The only drawback is it removed the subtitles to play the tracks, so you lose all of the French conversation translations. Most of the rated/unrated version differences are towards the latter half of the film (violent half) as at 41 minutes there was only a nine second variance.<br /><br />2 of the commentary tracks are exclusive to the unrated, the side by side documentary provides comparison on the actual shooting stock to the final film cut, a 20 minute making-of provides some nice insight, but then I was hit with a rare emotional moment on a BD supplement. There was a nice film premiere documentary with interviews of cast and crew on the carpet, but most noticeably some very touching footage of Natasha and Liam. Some brief but genuine moments that speak for themselves.<br /><br />An incredibly worthwhile Blu to own, and I rank Liam's performance as a believable action star right at the top.</p></body></html>

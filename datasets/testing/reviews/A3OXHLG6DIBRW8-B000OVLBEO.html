We wanted to see this before heading out to see the new movie, and I am glad for the revist.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: The story starts following Johnny Blaze as a young motorcycle stunt rider that makes a deal with the devil. Like most deals of this type, even when made with the best of intentions, it doesn't work out like Johnny plans. Years later the devil come calling to collect on his debt and that is when things get interesting. As Johnny becomes the "Ghost Rider", he discovers that he has more free will than one might expect for "The Devil's Bounty Hunter".<br /><br />The casting is fairly good, even with a slightly older than he should be Nicholas Cage in the lead, but it works. I really enjoyed Eva Mendes as Roxanne, Johnny's girlfriend, and Sam Elliott as an unexpected mentor. Peter Fonda also is believable as the devil. The special effects are also fairly good and help carry the movie through the slower parts.<br /><br />I enjoyed this a lot, especially for a comic book based movie.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></body></html>

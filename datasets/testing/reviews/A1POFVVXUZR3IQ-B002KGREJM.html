<meta name="summary" content="Well-deserved Oscar for Whitaker"></head><body><p>The Last King of Scotland truly showcases Forest Whitaker's talents as an actor. He brings to life the brutal dictator Idi Amin of Uganda, who during his reign as President of Uganda, was responsible for the murders of 300,000 people, thus earning himself the title of one of history's worst mass murderers. Forest Whitaker is able to personify Amin through his authentic accent, his gestures and mannerisms, and it his electrifying portrayal of Amin that makes this movie shine. The other main character, the fictional Dr Nicholas Garrigan, is played effectively by James McAvoy, and his portrayal of the charmed and naive young doctor who later views Amin with repulsion is convincing. The one complaint I had with the movie was the lack of depth in exploring further the complex character that was Amin, who at first seems the benevolent leader, and gradually turns into a despot, & ruthless murderer, appearing more deranged as his reign finally came to an end with his expulsion out of Uganda. For a more in depth insight into Amin, I would recommend General Idi Amin Dada - The Criterion Collection [DVD].</p></body></html>

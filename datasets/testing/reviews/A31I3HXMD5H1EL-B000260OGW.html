<meta name="summary" content="Kevin Costner's Tribute to the Cowboy..."></head><body><p>OPEN RANGE is, perhaps, the finest western since UNFORGIVEN, with a sense of admiration and respect towards the Cowboy that Eastwood's film never achieved. While the premise of the film is simple (Western 'justice', after cowboys are ravaged by a cattleman who 'owns' a small town), the characters are so warm and human that you 'care' for them...an effect that has been lacking in the westerns of the last few years!<p>Set against some of the most breathtaking vistas ever recorded on film, crusty Boss Spearman (Robert Duvall, who steals the film), and laconic Charley Waite (Kevin Costner, also fabulous), are long-time friends who are taking a small herd of cattle cross-country to market. With only a big, affable cowpoke, Mose (Abraham Benrubi) and a young Mexican kid, Button (Diego Luna) in their crew, the four (with Waite's dog, Tig), are forced to sit out a massive summer storm, playing cards and sharing a camaraderie that feels totally real and natural. At storm's end, Spearman sends Mose to a nearby town to pick up supplies. After several days pass, and Mose doesn't return, Spearman and Waite leave Button to watch the camp, and ride to town to find their missing friend. They discover that the town is run by a ruthless, bullying cattle baron, Denton Baxter (Irish actor Michael Gambon, who has replaced the late Richard Harris in the HARRY POTTER series), who informs them that Mose is in jail, and orders them to get him, and get off his range, pronto! Mose has been beaten, mercilessly, so the pair take him to the town doctor (Dean McDermott), who treats the man for free, as the giant had given a good accounting of himself in a fight with three of Baxter's goons. The doctor's sister, Sue (Annette Bening, showing all of her years, but radiantly beautiful) and Waite feel an immediate, mutual attraction, but he mistakenly thinks her to be the Doc's wife, and holds his piece. Taking the bandaged Mose with them, the cowboys return to camp.<p>While away, Button sees a group of riders, in white hoods, hovering around the herd. Knowing that they work for Baxter, Spearman and Waite jump them, after dark, beating them as revenge for Mose...then return to camp to discover another group of Baxter's men have attacked, killing Mose and the dog, and leaving young Button for dead. Taking the boy to the doctor, they discover he had left to treat Baxter's men, and Sue takes on the task of saving the boy's life.<p>Justice must be served, but Baxter 'owns' the sheriff, so it falls on Spearman and Waite to end the cattleman's reign of terror...and it is revealed that Waite has a past history as a gunman...<p>This film is rich with detail, and has an extraordinary supporting cast, particularly Michael Jeter (who died shortly after filming) as a sympathetic stable owner. While the film is leisurely paced, it never drags, and the conversations between Spearman and Waite, about everything from getting old to the advantages of settling down, are a complete joy. Add to this a riveting climactic shootout, and you have a Western that is a truly satisfying experience!<p>Kudos to director/star Costner, for his respect of the Western genre, and for making the best film (thus far) of 2003!</p></body></html>

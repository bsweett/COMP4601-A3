<meta name="summary" content="Go buy Jacobs ladder ....."></head><body><p>This is a cheap rip off of Jacob Ladder  Starring tim robbins.T<br /><br />The acting is ok, the girl who plays Jackie is not a great actress and is actually very annoying to watch well for me atleast. What i dont get is she picks up this guy off the street and brings him home not knowing him and tells him to sleep over , while she sleeps in the other room. Who in there right mind would do that. Anyway i didnt like this movie.<br /><br />Most will like the movie i mean its an ok movie but just reminds me to much of a movie made from taking ideas from other great movie.</p></body></html>

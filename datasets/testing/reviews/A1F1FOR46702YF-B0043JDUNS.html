<meta name="summary" content="Robert Downey Jr. and his incredible Suit of Armor"></head><body><p>Director Jon Favreau continues to excel with Marvel's new superhero franchise in the exciting blockbuster sequel "Iron Man 2". With the world now aware of his secret, billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is determined to ensure that his Iron Man technology doesn't fall into the wrong hands, despite the countless pressures from the US government to turn over his technology for military application. If knowing that his personal arc reactor is slowly poisoning his body wasn't bad enough, Stark must also deal with the vengeful scientist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) and the greedy industrialist Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell). "Iron Man 2" delivers everything that one would expect for a big Summer blockbuster sequel. Though it does fall short of the original, many of the key elements are still present in the sequel, and it definitely offers a very good dose of exciting action and impressive special effects. Robert Downey Jr. continues to dominate the role of Tony Stark. The cast also includes Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson.<br /><br />"Iron Man 2" is one of this year's biggest movies, and Paramount certainly delivers a standout fully-loaded 3-disc presentation that ranks as one of the best Blu-ray releases of the year. The blockbuster sequel is presented in a 2.35:1 HD format. The picture quality is excellent and its DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio sound is certainly amazing. Among special features, it includes a commentary track by director Jon Favreau, the four-part documentary "Ultimate Iron Man: The Making of Iron Man 2", 6 behind-the-scenes featurettes (Creating Stark Expo, Practical Meets Digital, Illustrated Origin: Nick Fury, Illustrated Origin: Black Widow, Illustrated Origin: War Machine & Working With DJ AM), picture galleries, trailers and 8 deleted scenes. Overall, "Iron Man 2" scores an "A-".</p></body></html>

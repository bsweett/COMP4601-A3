They did a fantastic job; the chemistry between them is real, and the latter's `The Lady in the Water' has ethereal beauty that makes us believe the presence of the nymphs.<br /><br />But I didn't like the film, not because the story is unbelievable or contrived. A narf from a bedtime story might rise from a small swimming pool in an apartment complex at night, and she might be saved by a lonely superintendent. I really like that part, and again I say, both Bryce Dallas Howard and Paul Giamatti playing these roles respectively are just wonderful.<br /><br />But the film is saddled with too many things - the meaning of `Story' or the narf is too obvious; the idea of `symbolist' `guardian' etc is interesting, but poorly handled (what is he reading, and how?); and one character played by Bob Balaban, which is also director M. Night Shyamalan's personal letter, is simply an unnecessary addition. A good story doesn't need any self-reference. It keeps telling something about itself, but M. Night Shyamalan is tempted to say something more.<br /><br />But what is most annoying to me is M. Night Shymalan himself, not as director, but as actor. He plays a pivotal role in `Lady in the Water,' but to be honest, he is no professional actor, and it is painfully clear when he is seen beside Paul Giamatti or Bryce Dallas Howard. What is worse is the nature of the role he assigned to himself - a misunderstood author whose works will be appreciated rightly in the future. I don't deny his talent as director, but this kind of personal reaction, if understandable itself, need necessarily not to be revealed on screen.<br /><br />M. Night Shyamalan, it is said, first thought of this film's plot as a bed-time story. A good bed-time story is always simple and, if it has a hidden meaning, it has to be to the point. A very good bed-time story is actually there, in the story about a narf and a super, just like `The Beauty and the Beast,' but we are not allowed to know about them very much.</p></body></html>

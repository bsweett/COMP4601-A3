The story had enough emotional impact for those looking for a bit more.  A few scenes could have been cut here and there to make it a tighter film, but overall it was a very good, atmospheric film experience.<br /><br />It's not one of those movies where you can automatically guess what happens.  Actually, one of the tricks of this film--now this is interesting--is that there are many points where viewers will think they've got it figured out.  Well, all those assumptions will be blown away by the end of this movie, which I thought was rather clever.  As things started to wrap up, I thought the end was going to be a big downer (as in depressing, not disappointment), but again--my assumptions were wrong.<br /><br />One thing I didn't like about this movie was the use of music.  Good music--like good acting and writing--is invisible, because it adds to the overall mood of the story.  However, music that tells the audience what to feel by being too loud, overly dramatic, or sappy has no place in the world of film, and there were a few instances in this film where I felt that the music was doing just that.  I'm not referring to the use of the song "We've Only Just Begun," which was bone-chillingly effective, but the actual score of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, 1408 is a vast improvement over the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V4UH0I">brainless</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHRVP6">gore-fests</a> of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00105303S">torture porn</a> trying to pass as horror these days.  1408, though it isn't perfect, is an example of what horror flicks should aspire to be.<br /><br />8/10</p></body></html>

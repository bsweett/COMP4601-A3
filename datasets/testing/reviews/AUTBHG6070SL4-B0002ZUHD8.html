<meta name="summary" content="An enjoyably different Arthur"></head><body><p>This is a very good swashbuckler, with a bit more reality than the typical Arthur. To tell the truth, I like seeing a bit less magic and a bit more that makes sense. For example, this movie retells the "sword in the stone." That retelling loses the hocus-pocus and prophecy, but gains a lot in personal, human meaning. The movie demotes Merlin from some mystical being to a pagan priest/leader. On the other hand, he is also promoted to powerful political figure, prepared to weigh the relative threats of different enemies and shift alliances as needed.<br /><br />The battle scenes show some real creativity. The fight on the iced lake, even when you know the outcome well in advance, still builds well. The excitement of the final battle was not just due to the sheer mass of its mayhem, it also had a tempo and some scripting to keep the viewer watching.<br /><br />Of course, Knightley's Guinevere kept people watching, too. The babe appeal was there, especially in that combat uniform. If you haven't seen it yet - well, there are some outfits that really require a figure as slim as hers. More than that, though, I enjoyed the role of Guinevere as battle-maid and woman who gets what she wants. Oh, and the "sword upheld" at the end was a nice touch, too.<br /><br />This movie offers a lot, just not the King Arthur of myth. If you want the chivalry, questing, and pining of the standard story, you just won't find what you want. This movie really has to be taken as a mideval action flick of its own, not a retelling of the familiar story. If you can take it in that spirit, there's a lot to enjoy.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

A few reviewers were dissing it so far, but I happened to enjoy it.<br />It was dark, rainy, fast paced, interesting story line that really makes you want to get to the core of it, thight leather clothes, flying, shooting, running, picturesque fighting sequences.<br />I'm glad i saw it, dont let them tell you otherwise.<br />Also the lycans (werewolves) looked really cool, big raw cats, and the transformatin you got to watch was really some oscar worty special effects.</p></body></html>

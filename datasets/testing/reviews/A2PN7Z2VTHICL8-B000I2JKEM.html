Victor stumbles through his wedding lines during rehearsal, and wanders off into the woods to practice.  Unfortunately, Victor finally gets the lines right and awakens the corpse bride, a girl who died on her wedding day and has been waiting for her husband to return.  The corpse bride, Emily, rises from the earth in front of Victor and accepts his vows.<br /><br />Emily takes Victor "downstairs" to her world, the world of the dead, while his true love Victoria awaits him in the land of the living.  When Victor shows up in the living world only to confess he has married a corpse, the Everglot's arrange for Victoria to marry someone else, a pompous devil who believes the Everglot's have money, Barkis Bittern.<br /><br />Will Victor be forced into honoring the vows he spoke to Emily, or will he be set free to marry the live and innocent Victoria before she falls victim to Barkis?<br /><br />In my opinion, the problems with this film outweighed the attractions.  It seemed to straddle the fence between its appeal to a children's audience and an adult audience, making it flavorless in both arenas.  It's a little too gruesome, in spite of its "cuteness", for small children, yet the songs and the shallowness left it too insipid for adults.<br /><br />The vocal talents gathered are among the best; Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham-Carter, Joanna Lumley (I LOVE Absolutely Fabulous, sweetie-darling), the remarkable Albert Finney, Tracy Ullman, and Christopher Lee, but without a decent script their talents were stifled.  The animation was fun, but stiff in places, such as where Emily's gown was supposed to float in the wind and wound out looking like a piece of cardboard.  And the songs were awful, the movie would have been better without attempting to be a musical.<br /><br />Rent before you buy.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

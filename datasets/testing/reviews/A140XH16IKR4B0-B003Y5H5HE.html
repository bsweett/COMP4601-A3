<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing -- Scorcese filmed the wrong story"></head><body><p>The trailers for "Hugo" are hugely misleading. I expected a fantasy story about a young orphan in Paris, with floating robots and mystery trains. Instead, I got a rather pedestrian tale about the orphan with little of the fantasy. Indeed - spoilers ahead! - the film became a biography of early cinematographer Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s, he of "Voyager to the Moon" fame. As sad as was the life of poor orphan Hugo, forced to wind clocks in the Montparnasse train station, the story of M&eacute;li&egrave;s (played by Ben Kingsley) was a much more compelling and could have been a film in itself. The Hugo material was too skimpy, making this part of the film tiresome. A couple of love stories between train station regulars might have made the film more bearable. As would a btter eye for comedy. I knew we were in trouble when an early scene, in which a character catches a leg brace in a train door, fell comedically flat. And Sacha Baron Cohen, as a brutal yet lovesick gendarme, was completely misdirected. His character was not given any motivation or his foul temper - the audience was left to imagine a war wound as the likely cause.<br /><br />I will say that Scorcese did a nice job of evoking 1920s Paris fashions, signage and technology. The train station was truly a bustling place full of thousands of stories every time a train arrived or departed. The Paris scenes were mostly done as matte paintings, and lacked realism. That might or might not be your cup of tea.<br /><br />"Hugo" is a huge waste of money, except that it will bring more attention to M&eacute;li&egrave;s and his enormous output of wonderful early films. The man was a creative genius and his story deserved not to be twisted with a nameless and fictional orphan. And the 3D brought nothing to the film, except a buck or two extra on the ticket price.<br /><br />I told you I was disappointed.</p></body></html>

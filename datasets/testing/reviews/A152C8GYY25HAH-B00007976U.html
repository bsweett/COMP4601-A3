<meta name="summary" content="Robin Williams superb in tight, intelligent thriller"></head><body><p>"One Hour Photo" is a clever, offbeat movie that is perhaps 2002's creepiest thriller. Its premise may be unlikely but it's still chillingly plausible. What if that nice man at the store where you have your photos developed has a dangerous obsession with your family? What if alienation and loneliness causes him to start acting out his fantasies? <p>Seymour Parrish [Robin Williams] is a quiet but pleasant middle-aged man who has worked for years in the photo department of a local discount store. He lives alone in a forlorn apartment. His social interactions seem limited to the store. This is the place where Nina and Will Yorkin, an apparently ideal couple has had family photos developed since their eight-year old son was an infant. What they don't know is that Seymour has made them his `adopted' family. He fantasizes about being a beloved relative. The Yorkins, however, turn out not to be the perfect family, and when Seymour discovers this, he goes off the deep end. <p>Robin Williams gives one of his finest performances as Seymour and is even scarier than he was as the killer in "Insomnia". Connie Nielson and Michael Vartan are quite convincing as the Yorkins. The movie's set and art design are especially good, strikingly contrasting Seymour's cold, blue-white world with the warm, earthy tones of the Yorkins'. <p>"One Hour Photo" is more than a mere thriller. It is a vivid portrait of an ordinary man torn apart by the ravages of alienation. On the surface, Seymour is a monster, but underneath, he is a soul in torment - one I can not help but feel empathy for. Though it's not always easy to watch, I recommend this one highly.</p></body></html>

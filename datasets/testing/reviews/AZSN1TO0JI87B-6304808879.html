It bears little resemblance to what was popular in horror at the time, and yet it's still a hit, and still strikes a chord with a massive audience. If you've ever seen it, you can't forget it. As many times as I've seen it, I still get uncomfortable (in a good way) and find new things to appreciate.<br /><br />"Hellraiser" is an extremely well made, mature movie that isn't for everyone, not even for every horror fan. There is no campy humor to it, no relief from the drama. It digs deep, and really brings to light just how ugly the world can be, and how cruel and senseless people can be, often under the spell of love. This is all performed, of course, by Julia and Frank (Claire Higgins and Sean Chapman), two very intense lovers who find themselves in a bind. See, it's not bad enough that Julia is actually married to all-around nice guy Larry (Andrew Robinson), who is in turn, Frank's brother, but apparently uncle Frank has a taste for the spicier things in life and finds himself in Hell after playing around with a puzzle (Pandora's Box, anyone?). In order to resurrect Frank, who is all but a mass of bloody tissue and bones, hiding out in an empty room in Larry's house, Julia lures innocent, albeit, horny men inside with the promise of a good romp. What they get, however, is usually a hit to the head with hammer, often repeatedly, and a visit with Frank, who sucks their blood from their body, which in turn makes him stronger and glues him back together, so to speak. However, there's a race against time here, as the Cenobites -- grotesque creatures of Hell who inflict unimaginable torture on anyone who solves the puzzle -- are looking for Frank after he escapes their clutches. Add to that, Larry's snoopy, attractive and intelligent daughter Kirsty (played by Ashley Laurence) is onto their scheme. Things get very dirty, very gross, and very bloody in the 93 minutes this movie runs. However, the gore (which is well acheived for it's time) is not what makes the movie crawl under your skin. It's the horrible things that Julia does for Frank, for her forbidden love. Just the fact that humans can be this ugly in real life is enough to make you uneasy. Aside from the far-fetched situation, this movie isn't that far removed from the real world. This vision, unfortunately, took a backseat in later sequels (starting with Part 3) to the character of Pinhead (whose name actually isn't mentioned in this installment) and the attempts to turn this into another "A Nightmare On Elm Street" type franchise failed miserably. I usually don't look down at horror sequels, I love 'em, but the only other installment that holds up as well as the original is part 2. But I digress.<br /><br />"Hellraiser" is a fantastic film, one that any genre fan should see at least once. It's different, it's bold, and it's risky, but it works. It's very gloomy, so I recommend you put yourself in the right mood before watching it. Clive Barker crafted the perfect horror film here, and considering the current horror movie climate, this history lesson is worth repeating. It won't exactly "Tear your soul apart," but it will make you very uncomfortable.</p></body></html>

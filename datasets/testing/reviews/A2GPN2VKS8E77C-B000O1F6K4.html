<meta name="summary" content="No Words Can Describe The Final Chapter In The El Mariachi Trilogy Except EPIC."></head><body><p>Antonio Banderas returns to the role that made him a star in DESPERADO, which also made Robert Rodriguez a household name and a star out of Salma Hayek. And this time, it plays out in epic fashion, like the final chapter in Sergio Leone's "Man With No Name" trilogy, "The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly." Johnny Depp, Willem Dafoe, Eva Mendes, Danny Trejo, Mickey Rourke, Enrique Iglesias and Cheech Marin also star. A fitting conclusion to the story continued in DESPERADO (I've not seen EL MARIACH, so I can't comment on it). Star power, a smartly written story and explosive action combine to make an action-packed good time. Rated R, but should have been rated PG-13.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="There Is No Substitute for Peter Sellers"></head><body><p>You can remake "The Pink Panther" ad nauseam, but Peter Sellers is the  only Inspector Clouseau - a screen immortal alongside Chaplin's Little Tramp and Tati's Monsieur Hulot. Despite his best efforts, Steve Martin provides a superfluous and painfully unfunny imitation. That's what you get for messing with a classic.</p></body></html>

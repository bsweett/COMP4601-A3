<meta name="summary" content="Quite delightful for a family film"></head><body><p>Personally, I believe one of the reasons for Terabithia's relative underwhelming box-office was its marketing campaign. From the trailers and the initial buzz, it sounded like it was going to be a sort of spiritual follow-up to Chronicles of Narnia with big effects, action set-pieces and the like. But when a family film with human elements mixed in with creatures now and then came out, people were like "wha? where's all the flashy stuff?" It's too bad since, on occasion the film has a few flaws, this is actually quite an entertaining film even if you don't watch with kids.<br /><br />Jess is one of those kids that grows up with in a hard-working family that struggles to make ends meet (just a suggestion: maybe not have so many kids?). Secondhand clothes and can't even get a new pair of shoes, he's picked on a lot at school. Enter Leslie who is of a more wealthier family but her quirky likes and attitudes gets her much disdain from others also. But with Jess's love for art and Leslie's overactive imagination, the 2 quickly bond and using the woods nearby their houses, they imagine a fantasy world named Terabithia with creatures and various races and start to learn about growing up and making long-lasting friendships.<br /><br />Now, I will admit that the more fantasy aspects of the story might be seen as out of place. If you're putting in effects, why not go full-throttle right? But that's not the point here which uses the Terabithia world to show kids imagining to escape their real lives. Bullies take on the forms of different races in their make-believe world and adults who don't know how to deal with children who are growing older. But it sort of livens up the film by showing the Weta effects since if they were taken out, this thing would be schmaltzy like crazy. It's mainly story-driven which might make it that sort of catch-22 feeling: too character driven for the younger crowd and not enough wonder for the older crowd.<br /><br />It's also great to see that the bulk of the film is focused on 2 actors who are NOT annoying. While not a flashy role, Josh Hutcherson plays that character who's surprised yet down-to-earth about the real world and the fantasy one without overplaying one of them. Getting the more flashier role is AnnaSophia Robb who reminds me of a younger Natalie Portman who has quite a stage presence although her more wilder flights of fancy could be dialed down since she always seems "on". Also kudos for casting the way-too-adorable-to-be-real Zooey Deschanel and Robert Patrick playing Jess's dad.<br /><br />I should mention the ending since that's what got the biggest attention. It follows the book as far as tone and although it's quite a big development in the film, I can understand why people won't like it since kid movies aren't meant to be this "heavy". But considering many of us remember Bambi's mother and watching those kind of films, here it makes sense and handled perfectly.<br /><br />I'd recommend it to kids although I'm not sure what they'll think of it. It's not as visually exciting as Narnia or cool as Harry Potter but for an adult, it's quite enjoyable so at least if your kids don't like it, at least you can.</p></body></html>

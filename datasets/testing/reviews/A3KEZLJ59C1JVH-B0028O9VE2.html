All of the promotions made it look like just another Adam Sandler comedy, which is fine and dandy, but I usually don't shell out the money to see Adam Sandler's movies in the theatre. However, "Spanglish" is so completely different from anything Sandler has ever done before. It's a comedy and a drama that will make you laugh and cry, and I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />Sandler actually has more of a supporting role in "Spanglish." The story revolves around a woman and her daughter who emigrate to the United States from Mexico. Flor (Paz Vega)  speaks no English but is determined to build a good life for her daughter Christina (Shelbie Bruce). She accepts a housekeeping job at the home of a dysfunctional couple (Sandler and Tea Leoni, who gives an excellent performance as Sandler's crazy, selfish wife). Flor must contend with her new employer's hostility toward her own family and her unwanted influence on Christina. "Spanglish" is a heartwarming movie about love, family, and responsibility. It was a thousand times better than I expected it to be, and I suggest that everyone watch it! (The only thing I didn't like about the film is that the movie is so open-ended. What happens with John and Deb?! Inquiring minds want to know!)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="MATT DAMON!!!"></head><body><p>"The Bourne Supremacy" is a high-octane thriller about an amnesiac retired CIA hitman who is brought in from the cold by opposing elements who want to frame him for a killing he didn't commit.  The film contains alot of globehopping cat-and-mouse intrigue, thriling action setpieces and one crackerjack carchase.  Besides Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, the film offers Joan Allen, Brian Cox, and Julia Stiles in supporting roles.  What this densely plotted film does not offer is any deep character development for the actors to work with.  This film is the equivalent of fast food;easy to digest but eminently forgettable.  It's no coincidence that this film was initially released during the dog days of Summer when the mind does not need to ponder weighty issues.  That doesn't mean that a movie has to be this lightweight.</p></body></html>

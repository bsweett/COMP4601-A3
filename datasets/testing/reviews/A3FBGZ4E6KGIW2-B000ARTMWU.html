<meta name="summary" content="It was okay, but could have been something great."></head><body><p>I heard a lot of good things about this movie before I watched it.  I was impressed by all the gore and I thought to myself that finally, in this genre, there was going to be an excellent movie.  All the way up until the ending, I was really into it.  The ending messes up the movie because things start making absolutely no sense.  If they would have incorporated the ending into the movie where it would have made more sense, this movie would have been better than I thought it was.  Another thing that took the viewing pleasure away from me was the poor dubbing.  I would rather watch this in French with English subtitles, at least that way, it wouldn't be so annoying.  Overall, I would say this is good for a rental.  I have to say that I am slightly disappointed because this showed so much potential.</p></body></html>

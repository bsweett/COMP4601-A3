But then this is not the current 3d format that uses shutter glasses. Like my new panasonic vt50 uses. This is the green red anaglypth glasses. This needs to be re released unto a proper 3d disc like they are doing for 'jaws 3d" from the same year.  The movie is one of the better in the friday the  13th series and they have dropped the ball in releasing the rest of the series for some reason. Still getting this in any 3d format at all in 2009 was a good thing. if only they'd have waited just one year later and the great 3d format was out. Oh well. You could watch this in 2d and make it 3d with your 3d tv but it won't look as good as it did at the theater for sure.  A re release is needed along with a release of the rest of the series.  THe picture looks great though and that is a good thing.  Jason puts on the mask for the first time here and that another interesting fact. This is worth owning , but like I said , lets have a re-release.</p></body></html>

I cannot repeat this enough: it is a fairy tale, it features children, it features children overcoming grotesque challenges to emerge triumphant, but it is NOT. FOR. CHILDREN.<br /><br />And that's a shame, because the fairy tales in Pan's Labyrinth once were told to children.  Beware the Poisonous Toad, whose selfish gluttony killed off a magical tree.  Beware the Pale Man, who consumed children that succumbed to their own hunger.  And most importantly, beware Fauns who give orders, for they are tricksters never to be fully trusted.<br /><br />Poor Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is caught in a power struggle between her mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) pregnant with ruthless captain Vidal's (Sergi Lopez) child.  It's clear that Vidal could care less for Ofelia, who is not of his blood.  His only concern is that Carmen bear him a son; the birth of her brother will most certainly send Ofelia to her doom. Caught between these two worlds of war and magic, Ofelia's salvation lies in the rebellious servant Mercedes (Maribel Verdu) and an ancient faun (Doug Jones).<br /><br />In the end, Ofelia has no choice.  There are monsters everywhere: lurking in her home, in the forest, and in the labyrinth. Caught between faerie and famine, she can only choose her final home. Depending on your perspective, the ending is a triumph of the human spirit or the sad conclusion to a military conflict. In the end, we discover that little girls are made of sterner stuff than boys: Toads and snails and fairy tales.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One hell of a magic trick"></head><body><p>Christopher Nolan returns with The Prestige, a movie about revenge and the obsessive minds of two rival magicians. And what a magical experience this was.<br /><br />Based on Christopher Priest's novel, The Prestige examines the destructive nature of revenge, framed within the illusory and competitive world of magic. Using the deceptive concept of trickery, the genre goes almost to science fiction as it blurs the edges between reality and fantasy.<br /><br />Rupert Angier and Alfred Borden are, as Borden says, "Two young men devoted to an illusion." Originally in good terms, the two become enemies when Angier blames Borden for the death of his wife Julia, who drowns when a trick they are performing goes horribly wrong. Following the tragedy, Borden's personal life and career flourish. Meanwhile, Angier's life takes the opposite trajectory. And filled with pain and anger he embarks on a vengeful path that has deadly consequences. Their rivalry grows more vicious and desperate, with their magic skills used not only to wow audiences but wreak havoc on one another.<br /><br />But, as you'd expect in a film involving magicians, things are rarely as they appear.<br /><br />This movie has everything: excitement, thrills, twist and turns, romance, surprises. When The Prestige begins, nothing makes any sense. The story goes backwards and forwards through time. But before too much goes on, things start getting clearer. Bit by bit, everything comes into focus. But to get there, you'll have to earn it. You'll have to hate it before you like it. During it's running time The Prestige will make you irritated, confused, exasperated, frustrated but before it's over... you'll fall in love with it.</p></body></html>

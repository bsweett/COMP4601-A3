<meta name="summary" content="Seriously, this isn't for toddlers or for stodgy adults with no imagination"></head><body><p>Craig Ferguson's voice is a perfect natural for this 2010 release Viking based, animation film, "How To Train Your Dragon."  Yes you need to bring your imagination and let go of being too much of an adult as you view this 2010 release.  Dreamworks gets a big kudos from me for their efforts sharing the epic story of Hiccup (Viking young lad) befriending a dangerously lethal, special forces dragon he names "Toothless" (retractable teeth).<br /><br />We all have a sentimental romantic concept of what and who the Vikings were back there in the Dark Ages from 800 A.D. to 1000 A.D. with their two handed battle axes that could split armor and shields with ease, arriving by longboats in or around regions such as Constantinople, Iceland, Russia, Greenland, Newfoundland, Ireland, Britain and other parts of Europe known as Scandinavian (Norse) savages, explorers, warriors, merchants, and pirates, and one of my favorite depictions of those rough hewn enduring epic folklore people was brought to the screen in a 2005 film named "Beowulf & Grendel" starring (pay attention) Stellan Skarsgard, Ingvar Eggert Sigurdsson, Gunnar Eyjolfsson, Philip Whitchurch, Ronan Vibert, Rory McCann, Hring ur Ingvarsson, Elva Osk Olafsdottir, Olafur Darri Olafsson, Steinunn Olina Persteinsdottir, (I'm not kidding) and one other name that helped make this earlier epic saga film authentic and believable, which of course was the outstanding actor Gerard Butler.<br /><br />Well, heed my warning about that 2005 version of "Beowulf & Grendel" being not for the squeamish or easily-given-nightmares type viewer.  THAT film isn't animation, it uses real people, with real places, and realistic terror.  Although not as terrifying as the 1999 release of "The 13th Warrior" with Antonio Banderas (also an epic saga about Vikings), "Beowulf & Grendel" (2005 release with Gerard Butler) still has its moments.<br /><br />On the other hand, "How To Train Your Dragon" is animated.  Therefore it by default isn't intended to be as frightening to the point of heart stopping dread and intrepidation.  It still can be pretty scary at times though for any child under 10 years of age.  The ancient dragon king that comes out of the abyss can be interpreted by impressionable minds as equivalent to the devil out of hell (which is terrifying for the deeply religious).  I'm just giving you a heads up for that potential, I'm not saying it was intentional by the makers of "How To Train Your Dragon."<br /><br />Gerard Butler is the voice of a main character (the dad) in this 2010 animated film, and has obviously studied the Viking culture.  Whereas I will readily agree you can't help but fall in love with the dragon dubbed "Toothless" I also have to add my perspective that it isn't only the weak, frail, timid, and outcast kid (who fails at almost everything else) who can and does have wisdom and empathy enough to consider sentient life worth respect and having a charitable "live and let live" objectivity as a good way of discovering that everybody else's enemy isn't necessarily your enemy too.  But putting aside the idea that a fierce, deadly, gruesome "night fury" dragon can be trusted unconditionally to love a helpless boy enough to team up with an otherwise useless failure personality and become heroes (which has a spectrum of connotations that almost gave me an aneurysm), if you can overlook how a father who disowns his son and gives up on mentoring him to be equipped for survival and acceptance among his own people, then later on after the son does the most rebellious, against-the-grain thing imaginable, the dad tells him how he's proud of him, well then if you can overlook those details, then yes this is a good movie.<br /><br />The point I'm trying to make is you can over analyze anything.  This movie is supposed to be an escape from reality, softening and conquering what frightens us, overcoming brutal ignorance from those who would barricade our dreams, and making friends out of otherwise potentially deadly enemies.  Come away with Hiccup to an island called Berk, where he wins the heart of his overly macho village champion father by making friends with a few of the dragon creatures who make a habit of destroying their homes and food supplies, and maim their fellow villagers who manage to survive.  Try to forget the psychological impetus possibilities off on whatever tangent, and just enjoy the awesome depiction of camaraderie that you don't have in your own reality.  It is a cartoon for crying out loud.  Let go of logic, and step into fantasy.  You know, like believing your boss knows how valuable you are on your real life job.<br /><br />Very enjoyable, fun, and I wish I had a dragon friend like "Toothless."  Buy this DVD movie and enjoy it over and over with the family (except kids under 10 who might have nightmares).  Bravo Dreamworks.</p></body></html>

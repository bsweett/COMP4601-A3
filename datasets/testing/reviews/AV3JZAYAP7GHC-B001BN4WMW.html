This film is well written, well acted, well crafted, and truly worth every award it's received. Rent it, buy it. Just watch it and enjoy.<p>It's an oft-told tale: of a quiet hero forced by circumstances to take a stand again forces that seek to destroy what he values most. Sound familiar? It should. It's been the basis of drama for, oh about 2,500 years. And why? Because it works.<p>This film takes place during a period that, unless you're Scottish or are interested in Medieval Britain, most of us know very little about. I certainly didn't know about William Wallace and I AM a history buff... The setting doesn't get in the way of the story, and I found myself more than entertained. I found myself inspired. Not by Wallace's specific struggle, but by Gibson's treatment of the ideas behind it.<p>Now, the violence and gore may turn off some viewers, but this film packs a wallop in telling its tale. There's all the elements of the epic, including romance and betrayal and, of course, war. Gibson has been justly acclaimed for faithfully reproducing the look and feel of medieval Scotland -- blood, guts, mud and all.<p>Oh and to the "not historically accurate" nay-sayers: I don't care if it's historically inaccurate. So what? If I wanted historical accuracy I'd read a dmn non-fiction book or watch PBS. Sheesh.</p></body></html>

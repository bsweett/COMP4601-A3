<meta name="summary" content="This is some of Steven Speilberg's best work"></head><body><p>I have seen all three of these films on VHS tapes and on TV and I can say I love all three. Raiders Of The Lost Ark is a good film, The Temple of Doom is my personal favorite of the three, and The Last Crusade is the second best in the trilogy. I have yet to own these DVDs but, when I get the chance I will get them.<br /><br />P.S. These, DUEL, THE FIRST TWO JURASSIC PARKS, JAWS, are Speilberg at his best.</p></body></html>

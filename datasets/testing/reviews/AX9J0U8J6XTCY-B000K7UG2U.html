<meta name="summary" content="electrifying, intense and taut thriller.........."></head><body><p>SUPERB, ON A LEVEL WITH MR. DEMME'S 'SILENCE OF THE LAMBS"! THE ACTING BY MS. STREEP IS CERTAINLY OSCAR WORTHY, MR. WASHINGTON FINALLY HAS A REAL ROLE AGAIN THAT HE THROWS HIMSELF INTO, AND MR. SCHRIEBER GIVES HIS BEST EVER PERFORMANCE. I WAS SO INTENSLY INVOLVED, I HAD TO PAUSE IT TWICE-YOU JUST DO NOT KNOW WHERE IT'S HEADING, OR WHOSE SIDE IS PLAYING WHOM, INCLUDING THE FEDS. IT'S A BRILLIANT, BREATHTAKINGLY PACED TWISTING THRILLER, WITH A FINE SCRIPT, LAVISHLY PHOTOGRAPHED, AND A MUST OWN FOR ANYONE'S DVD COLLECTION.</p></body></html>

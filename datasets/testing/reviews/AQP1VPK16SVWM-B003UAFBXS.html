Campbell, King of the B (and sometimes Z)movie, frequent television guest star and all around Chin that can kill gives a very funny performance as Elvis in a film that puts &quot;Van Helsing&quot; and other wanna-be camp-fests to shame. Directed by Don Coscarelli (&quot;Phantasm&quot;), &quot;Bubba Ho-Tep&quot; has the tone of a Coehn brothers film with the perfect over-the-top story.<p>Elvis isn't dead. He just went to a rest home. The whys and wherefores of this departure are discussed in the very funny voice over narration. Most importantly Elvis hooks up with JFK. Yes, JFK didn't die. He was also put into a rest home for national security. After having half his brain removed and being died black to protect his identity. Turns out these two American icons must fight a soul-sucking zombie in Texas. Oh, and the zombie dresses as a cowboy.<p>It also has its serious moments but luckily the soul sucking and crime fighting are the major attractions here. Picture quality looks really, really good and there's loads of extras. Audio commentary by Campbell, Coscarelli and the &quot;King&quot;. We also have four featurettes, deleted scenes, photo gallery, original theatrical trailer, TV spot, the writer of the short story that inspired this Joe Lansdale reading from his story. Oh, let's not forget the music video. That's worth the price of admission alone. <p>Anyhow, there's quite a bit of good storytelling here and this film is loads of fun much like Sam Raimi's &quot;Evil Dead&quot; films. Anyhow, enjoy, rent buy or borrow this movie. You'll regret it if you don't.</p></body></html>

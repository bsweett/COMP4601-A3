<meta name="summary" content="What the Summer Blockbuster Should Aspire to Be"></head><body><p>Super 8 began last year with a marketing campaign that provided a general idea of what to expect from the film while revealing nothing. As the trailers became only slightly more revealing, the comparisons to Spielberg began. It's no secret that Steven Spielberg produced the film, so this comparison may seem easy but it is an inarguable fact that this film would not exist without his influence. Super 8 is the offspring of films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., and The Goonies but it never feels like a derivative cash-in and actually succeeds in taking moviegoers back to a time when the "summer blockbuster" meant something; a time when a good story went hand-in-hand with special effects and action sequences. There are two types of movies here and writer/director J.J. Abrams does a refreshing job balancing them both rather than letting the action overtake the story. Its adolescent characters, military villains, and late 70s, small town setting evoke memories of Spielberg but writer/director J.J. Abrams brings enough originality to the project that it's less of a rehash than a renaissance.<br /><br />The film takes place in the fictional town of Lillian, Ohio in 1979. 13-year-old Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney in an impressive debut) is helping his group of friends make a Super 8 movie at an old train depot. To the group's enjoyment, the "director" Charles (Riley Griffiths) has convinced local girl Alice (Elle Fanning) to drive them to the depot and appear in the movie. As they're shooting, a train appears in the distance and, in moments, is derailed by a pickup truck....And, for the purpose of preserving the surprise element; I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />Is the "secret" at the heart of the film really a secret anymore? Most people have enough information to deduce what's going on, but the less you know the better. It's all part of the effect Super 8 has. There are plenty of special effects and action sequences, but Abrams allows his film to build nicely before revealing what he has in store. Unlike most recent summer blockbusters, the action is never brainless; it serves a purpose and functions for the story as opposed to an excuse to show the advancements in technology. The first big special effects sequence is the train crash, which is one of the most intense, exciting sequences you're likely to come across this year. You may question the physics behind it, but you can't deny the heart-racing excitement it inspires nor can you deny the stunning special effects that made it possible.<br /><br />Super 8 really succeeds where most summer movies fail by delivering strong writing, with a good story and well-developed characters in addition to all the action. While Abrams may go for easy emotional cues his story has a lot of heart and Super 8 succeeds extensively on its likable, well-defined characters and human story. The story never feels like a backdrop for the action, a practice Hollywood has inexplicably embraced recently. Abrams obviously has an eye for casting as well. The adolescent actors in the lead roles are a talented, funny, and emotive group that convincingly embody their characters and never seem amateurish or annoying. The adult actors do fine jobs too, but the adults aren't as well-defined as the children are. Joe's dad, Deputy Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler) is the anguished, withdrawn father who steps in when things get messy while Colonel Nelec (Noah Emmerich) is the typical stone-faced military villain. This is a minor flaw that doesn't affect the overall quality of the film. Finally, it captures the 1979, small-town vibe wonderfully adding a very "classic feel" and is a great looking film in general; moody, nostalgic, and, yes, "Spielbergian."<br /><br />Super 8 does not disappoint on any level and is what a summer blockbuster should aspire to be. It is consistently entertaining, riveting from start to finish, and a wonderful reminder of the magic that's been missing from the movies. While it may be too soon to make such a bold statement, Super 8 seems destined to become a classic of its genre. J.J. Abrams is forging quite the career. It is impressive enough that he has made a special-effects heavy, science-fiction, summer film for a remarkably low $45 million at a time when the box office is overrun with movies with triple-digit budgets and double-digit IQs. Even more impressive is that he has fashioned a special-effects heavy, science-fiction, summer film that is one of the best films of this year.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></body></html>

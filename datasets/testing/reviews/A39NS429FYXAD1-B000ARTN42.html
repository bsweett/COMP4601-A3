Russell Crowe plays Jim Braddocok with such heartfelt integrity that it is impossible not to be swept up in his story and you will root for him from start to finish.  The boxing sequences are worth nothing for their artistry, as well.<br /><br />Giamatti and Zellweger both turn in earnest supporting performances but still pale alongside the great Crowe.  The 3 children, while not called upon for much ability, manage to pull at the audience heartstrings and an Honorable Mention to the always reliable Craig Bierko for delivering far more dimension to the role of Max Baer than was written.<br /><br />Solid special features enhance this DVD and make it one you will be glad to own.</p></body></html>

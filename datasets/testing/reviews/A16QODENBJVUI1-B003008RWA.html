<meta name="summary" content="Moore's best film yet and on a subject that is truly nonpartisan"></head><body><p>Poll after poll in recent decades has shown healthcare (or to speak more precisely, the lack of affordable healthcare for all) to be the issue that more Americans feel strongly about than any other.  But special interest groups, i.e., the medical insurance providers and the American Medical Associations, as well as hundreds of fake grass roots groups that they have funded, have managed to undermine the good of the nation as a whole.<br /><br />This truly is a nonpartisan issue.  The film makes reference to the National Health Service in Great Britain, which is enormously popular with conservatives and liberals, doctors as well as patients.  One of the individuals Moore interviews mentions that Margaret Thatcher, a noted conservative, was a strong defender of the NHS.  He could also have mentioned that a key person guiding it through the legislative process was one of the most notable conservatives of the 20th century, Winston Churchill.  This is not a liberal-conservative issue, but a people issue.  Free, universal healthcare is an amazingly good thing for nations as wholes.<br /><br />Moore does a great job of highlighting the problems with a for-profit health system.  Despite the defenders of free market capitalism, there are several things it simply isn't any good at.  One of them is at providing universal programs for the commonweal.  In the United States for-profit healthcare has had the effect of empowering and benefiting financial services industries (insurance companies) at the expense of individuals.  As a result, Americans find healthcare, which already is not universally available, to be increasingly expensive and unaffordable.  And drug prices are spiraling out of control.<br /><br />As Moore shows in the film, almost all developed countries have better healthcare systems than the United States.  Most provide free and universal healthcare.  Many politicians, who accept huge campaign donations from various medical special interest groups, raise the specter of socialized medicine and spread myths about the unavailability of basic medical services.  Most of SICKO is devoted to taking on these "myths," or, to use a better word, "lies."  One of the most commonly told lies is that Canadians are trapped in a terrible health system in which they are often denied treatment for months.  Moore interviews a number of Canadians who clearly abhor the American health system and passionately embrace their own.  Moore asks one of these people whether he is a socialist, only to be told that he is a member of the Conservative Party.<br /><br />We are also often told (i.e., lied to) that things are terrible in Great Britain and France.  Once again, Moore visits both places and discovers that both the British and the French love their healthcare systems.  In all this I felt increasingly ashamed of the situation in the United States, not merely because of the expense and the lack of universality, but the approach.  We tend to treat conditions only after they have gotten bad, while the French and British emphasize preventative medicine.  In fact, one British doctor explained that he gets a bonus if he is able to get people to stop smoking.  In short, the healthcare systems in Canada, Great Britain, and France are exceedingly popular, while I rather hear anyone talk about how they love the American healthcare system.<br /><br />For the record, I work for a major insurer of hospitals and medical facilities.  I work inside the very industry that is causing a lot of the problems.<br /><br />Hopefully this film will help focus more concern on the need to gut and redo the American healthcare system.  Personally, I think the think to do is to make a revised Medicaid universal.  It should be revised to eliminate the Bush drug program for seniors (which is hated by the left, the right, and seniors) and put in place a real drug assistance program.  Why should the rest of the advanced countries have free, universal, and excellent healthcare while the United States suffer from inferior care?<br /><br />The only difficulty I had with the movie was the Cuba sequence.  Why?  Well, Moore had already made his point cogently and convincingly.  The trip to Cuba introduces a note of controversy that cloudies the water.  True, Cubans have free and excellent healthcare despite the poverty of the nation, but one thing that the film overlooks is that like in most countries there is considerable difference between the healthcare provided in the city and in the country.  Most of Cuba is rural and the healthcare there is not as good as what one finds in the city.  (Much the same is true in countries like China, where the quality of healthcare in the city is quite good while in the country is substandard.)  In other words, I thought the whole Cuba segment weakened the overall film.<br /><br />Hopefully Americans will get angry and do something about this.  Historically we don't wake up and change things until we let things go further than we should.  We tend to be a pretty compliant nation, willing to put up with a great deal before we get mad enough to do something about it.  Maybe the time is becoming ripe to get rid of the system we have and get something decent instead.</p></body></html>

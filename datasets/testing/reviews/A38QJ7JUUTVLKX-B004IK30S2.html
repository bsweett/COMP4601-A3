<meta name="summary" content="This is funny!"></head><body><p>It's a one-joke premise. This is very quotable and is actually rewatchable. Each character is steriotypical but to the extreme, mix that is with the quirky personalities, and you have an undeniably funny cast. Will Ferrell stars as Ron Burgundy, the top-rated anchorman in San Diego in the `70s. Feminism marches into the newsroom in the form of ambitious newswoman Veronica Corningstone Ron is willing to play along at first-as long as Veronica stays in her place, covering cat fashion shows, cooking, and other "female" interests. But when Veronica refuses to settle for being eye candy and steps behind the news desk, it's more than a battle between two perfectly coiffed anchor-persons...well it's all out war. The comedic take on a woman invading the news desk in the 1970s was inspired by a decidedly more serious documentary on the women who actually broke that glass ceiling. Will Ferrell was watching the documentary, which featured interviews with several anchormen of the 1970s, and found some of the interviews with the newsmen to be unintentionally funny.</p></body></html>

I had to turn it off after an hour and I can't remember the last movie I didn't bother to finish watching.<br /><br />Terry Gilliam, aside from his legendary work with Monty Python, is probably the most overrated director there is.  Jabberwocky and Time Bandits were horrible. Brazil and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas were hit and miss.  His last good film was Twelve Monkeys...from 1995...11 years ago; and it doesn't look like he'll ever make another one.<br /><br />So skip this one...or at least skip the first hour...who knows, maybe the last half was pure genius.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Misleading title for a film that offers no real answers after an awesome opening sequence..."></head><body><p>HEREAFTER deserves a very mixed review because it deals only superficially with the supernatural and offers no real answers despite the fact that its craftsmanship is undeniable.<br /><br />After a brilliant start with the tsunami wreaking havoc as giant waves sweep over an entire village beach front, I expected HEREAFTER was about to delve into and explore the possibilities of an afterlife.<br /><br />Instead, we examine the lives of three separate individuals whose lives are about to converge rather unconvincingly at the finale. Meantime, we have no idea where the story is going until the final scene. There's an uneven quality to the thread of the story with many scenes played too long before getting near the payoff.<br /><br />But overall, the acting is excellent, particularly that of the little boys, FRANKIE and GEORGE McLAREN, who play the twin brothers effectively, CECILE DeFRANCE, the French woman who almost drowns during the tsunami and her lover (THIERRY NEUVIC), who makes the deepest impression as far as acting and charisma goes. MATT DAMON is effective as the psychic who wants nothing more to do with his "gift." But at all times, the script gives nothing more than a surface treatment of the hereafter and avoids delving into a deeper look at the supernatural implied by the film's title.<br /><br />HEREAFTER could have been a great film. As it is, it's uneven, slowly paced, and avoids the paranormal aspects that its title implies will be touched, especially since its main character is a psychic. But on the credit side, the opening sequence is amazing for its special effects. Unfortunately, what follows is not as absorbing, challenging or thought-provoking as it ought to be.<br /><br />The cooking class scenes between BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD and MATT DAMON were dragged out and less than satisfying, due to her irritating habit of delivering giggles with each line to suggest the airiness of her character. Furthermore, their relationship is never fully explored once he agrees to do a psychic reading. She just disappears from the plot line after foolishly begging Damon to practice his skill. The script might have taken a better turn if it resolved their relationship in a meaningful way for the conclusion. Likewise, there are other scenes that are totally irrelevant and give the story a lack of focus.<br /><br />An attempt to end the story of our three main characters on a bright note is only so-so in effect. I'd have preferred a deeper look at the supernatural than this hints at being and the ending just seemed downbeat and contrived.<br /><br />The acting throughout is uniformly fine and special praise is due MATT DAMON, THIERRY NEUVIC and the McLAREN brothers, all giving top-rated performances. Clint Eastwood's direction is fine but the script presented too many obstacles for any director to overcome.</p></body></html>

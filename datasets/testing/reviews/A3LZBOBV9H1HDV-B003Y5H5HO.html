This is how the story goes: Mikael Blomkvist is a financial reporter determined to restore his honor after being convicted of libel. Engaged by one of Sweden's wealthiest industrialists, Henrik Vanger, to get to the bottom of the long-ago disappearance of his beloved niece, Harriet -- murdered, Vanger believes, by a member of his large family -- the journalist heads to a remote island on the frozen Swedish coast, unaware of what awaits him. At the same time, Lisbeth Salander, an unusual but ingenious investigator with Milton Security, is hired to do a background check on Blomkvist, a job that ultimately leads to her joining Mikael in his investigation of who killed Harriet Vanger. Though Lisbeth shields herself from a world that has repeatedly betrayed her, her hacking skills and single-minded focus become invaluable. While Mikael goes face-to-face with the tight-lipped Vangers, Lisbeth plies the wired shadows. They begin to trace a chain of homicides from the past into the present, forging a fragile strand of trust even as they are pulled into the most savage currents of modern crime.<br /><br />The cast led by Daniel Craig (as Mikael Blomkvist) & Rooney Mara (terrific as Lisbeth Salander) is excellent. The directing by David Fincher is excellent. The screenplay (based on Stieg Larsson's novel) by Steven Zaillian (also executive produced) is excellent.<br /><br />The music by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross is excellent. The cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth is excellent. The film editing by Kirk Baxter & Angus Wall is excellent. The casting by Laray Mayfield is excellent. The production design by Donald Graham Burt is excellent. The art direction by Frida Arvidsson, Linda Janson, Pernilla Olsson, Tom Reta, Kajsa Severin & Mikael Varhelyi is excellent. The set decoration by K.C. Fox is excellent. The costume design by Trish Summerville is excellent.<br /><br />This is an excellent and well-crafted film that keeps you on the edge of your seat with your mind thinking and your heart racing. It is also a well-paced and well-made film that is faithful, not only to the novel, but the original Swedish language film, which this is a terrific companion to. Rooney Mara gives a terrific, career-making performance as Lisbeth and she and Daniel Craig have a great chemistry together. This is one of the best films of the winter-holiday season and of the year.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This is the reason why Video games do poorly as movies."></head><body><p>The Tombraider series has done well as a video game, mainly due to it's good gameplay and the main character, which the designers managed to give a personality (as well as breasts)that supersedes the other paper thin characters in the video game market. <p>However, that does not mean that it would transfer well into good cinema, where breasts just don't cut it as good character development or story telling. <p>The film project starts well enough by getting Angelina Jolie. While her accent in this movie is mixed at best, she looks the part and has the body to match. <p>However, the rest of the pieces that make the Tomb Raider pie fall completely short. <p>Simon West, a mediocre director at best, is not known for movies where character development is prevalent. I mean, in his Con Air, he has accomplished actors like John Cusack, Nicolas Cage (at that time), Ving Rhames and John Malkovich, but ends up making them paper characters, secondary to his image that movies should be a montage of 5 second cuts and involve one big explosion after another. <p>The writing team is little better and the story they provide is so preposterous, that they should be blacklisted for trying to subvert the already simple minded summer audiences into mindless zombies. <p>Lara Croft is a rich aristocrat type who is also a part proclaimed archaeologist. She get's this from her father who is also an archaeologist, but mysteriously disappeared while trying to find the location of the &quot;Clock of Ages&quot;, a wonderous object that can bend time when the planets are aligned (once every 5K years). <p>The force behind finding the clock and it's various parts is a group called the Illuminati, and they discover that Lara unwittingly has the first piece, which is needed to find the other two pieces, which operate the clock. <p>There are many problems that even my huge &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; mind cannot ignore. <p>1. It seems like Lara knows every language in the world. I mean, how many people can fluently speak Thai, Russian and can read obscure symbolic mumbo jumbo like it was all English? <p>2. She is bullet proof. She has the Arnold Swartzennegger, Commando syndrome, where bullets do not apply to her. 15 Commandos raid her home and she takes them all out without the need of a gun. <p>3. Scenes which involve getting a piece for the clock are arranged just like a video. Okay, I know this is based off a video game, but do you have to make it THAT obvious? <p>4. She is immune to cold. How many people can cross the Siberian wasteland in a T-shirt and a thin (often open) jacket? <p>5. She doesn't have to think. All the mysteries are given to her. And anything she doesn't know, the movie gods give her the answer without having to research any of it (this becomes apparent when a dog at the end of the movie walks through something that no one on earth has ever have seen before). Of course Lara knows that was a &quot;time storm&quot; and the effect that it would have, as if she sees such things on a regular basis. <p>Lara also doesn't seem to have much of a pulse. Her facial expression never seems to portray fear, nervousness or a sense that she might be in big trouble. Her voice rarely climbs above that sultry level she speaks, even if ten stone soldiers just tried to kill her. <p>Combine this with a one sided badguy who the director badly portrays as neither very evil or redeemably good and a love interest that she seems more annoyed with, Tomb Raider is my pick as one of the worst summer popcorn movies of 2001. <p>The DVD does a fair transfer and the sound effects are well done. If I had more interest in this movie, I would have checked out the special features, but I didn't. I turned this DVD off as the first credit opened and returned it for my money back</p></body></html>

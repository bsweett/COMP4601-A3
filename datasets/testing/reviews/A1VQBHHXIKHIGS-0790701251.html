<meta name="summary" content="Full Metal Jacket"></head><body><p>There was a point in the eighties and nineties when we were bombarded with Vietnam movies and Vietnam TV series. Overloaded with guilt about ignoring the war and its veterans, we went to the theaters and watched every awful flick Hollywood could churn out. I had a vague memory that FULL METAL JACKET was the best of this bunch. Yeah, I was right. It's excellent.<br /><br />If you've seen the film, of course you remember the drill sergeant. I could quote the first five minutes of his dialogue and bounce out of every mailbox with a spam filter. What do you figure? An hour of writing time for each minute of dialogue? Two hours per minute? You can't possibly take it all in at a single viewing. I have subtitles on the DVD, which is good because sometimes I laugh too loud to hear the words. The guy raised profanity to an art form.<br /><br />Boot camp was a powerful and accurate depiction of institutionalized abuse and manipulation. I know a lot of vets, 1940s through 1980s. They tell me this is real. It damn sure feels real. I won't let my inner cynic say anything about what the locals could learn from this DVD.<br /><br />But, this particular tragedy was only the first half of the film. Armed with whatever they learned in boot camp, they still had to go fight the war. This part of the film was also excellent. Jim Brown didn't run through a minefield or anything like that, but this film's probably more real.</p></body></html>

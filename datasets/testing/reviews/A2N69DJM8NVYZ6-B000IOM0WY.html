<meta name="summary" content="Good Movie"></head><body><p>The acting is very good in this movie as the actors are very good in their parts. Edward Norton does a great job as he plays a sleazy traitor who kills several people. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron do equally great jobs in their roles as they are very emotional and do a very convincing job. The rest of the supporting actors do a great job as thieves who all have their own personality. The short performance by Donald Sutherland was very good and believable.</p></body></html>

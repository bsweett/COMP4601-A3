A law-abiding citizen, he turns to the Justice Department for help, but instead of Justice he gets Nick (Jamie Foxx) a slick Assistant District Attorney whose only motivation in life is maintaining his 96% conviction rate.<br /><br />Nick, seeing holes in Clyde's eyewitness case where there are none, and fearing his numbers might go down, does a deal with Darby, the actual murderer (who gets three years for hacking Clyde's wife and daughter into bloody little pieces) to send Darby's accomplice (who never touched them) to the Death House.<br /><br />Ten years go by, and Darby's accomplice is put to death by lethal injection. Something goes horrifically wrong, and the man dies screaming and writhing before a roomful of witnesses. At the same time, Nick's family gets a FedExed DVD of a man in a mask hacking Darby into, not coincidentally, little bloody pieces. Nick is such a self-absorbed law-and-order ass that he doesn't come home from work when his hysterical wife calls him, much less attends his Elementary School-aged daughter's first Cello recital.<br /><br />Clyde is arrested on suspicion of the deaths of the two miscreants, and is sent to jail without bail to await trial. While Clyde is in jail, people connected with the Darby verdict continue to die spectacularly (my favorite is the judge, who is shot through the head by her own cellphone).<br /><br />So begins LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN, an F. Gary Gray film which, despite its action movie veneer, asks serious questions about the nature of justice and the justice system. There is nobody who doesn't agree that the system is a creaking monstrosity that doesn't work right. Just as in LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN, overburdened or overly ambitious prosecutors make deals that mock the ideas of punishment and rehabilitation, the death penalty is wrongly sought (leading to acquittals) and applied (leading to miscarriages of justice), and ultimately justice is not done, either upon victims or upon the accused and/or convicted.<br /><br />LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN is about the right of the individual to ensure that justice be done. Neither Clyde nor Nick is particularly likeable here, and neither is entirely right nor wrong. The storyline is highly implausible anyway. But, like many other reviewers, I found myself very disappointed in the ending, where Nick finally outsmarts Clyde. This unsatisfactory ending costs LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN two stars (at least). It would have been far better had Clyde chosen the ending of this story, leaving the chastened Nick to gather lessons from amongst the ashes of his own self-righteousness.</p></body></html>

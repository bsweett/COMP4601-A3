The film is nearly 50 years old, but the colors glow and the sound is wonderful. A painstaking frame-by-frame restoration was conducted, and the soundtrack remastered, resulting in a film which probably looks better now on DVD than when it was originally released. This film has always been a favorite of mine of all the Disney classics, and I think the music has a lot to do with it. "Once Upon a Dream" is truly beautiful, which is a given considering the classical composition it was based on. The artwork is superb, even for Disney in its heyday. This movie is rightly considered a classic, and has finally been given its due on DVD.</p></body></html>

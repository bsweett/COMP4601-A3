<meta name="summary" content="Kowalski's redemption - Eastwood's Shootist"></head><body><p>This is a movie that is more about redemption than about sheer race issues.  Kowalski lives in a run down part of Detroit, where he is a retired auto worker and Korean War Veteran.  He is a surly old man who despises everything and seemingly everyone.  His nieghborhood is totally Hmong with the only exception being him.<br /><br />We view him with his family, and interacting with his neighbors and then as you have seen in the trailers, his dealings with the local youths.  He starts a relationship with Thao and Sue, young Hmong neighbors who he builds an affinity for.  Totally politically incorrect, Kowalski spews racial and ethnic slurs in almost every sentence.  He is a bit of a loaner, especially since he became a widower, but he enjoys his car and his home and wishes his world had not changed so much.<br /><br />Kowalski calls everyone names, to their faces and he really does not care what type of rise it gets out of people.  He basically offends evryone, whites, blacks, hispanics, asians.  But you see the youth gangs from a variety of ethic perspectives and their own racism.<br /><br />Thao and Sue are like those you hear of in the news, the kids who have trouble come upon them, simply because they live in these areas.  Kowalski gets to know the Hmong, and they him.  He defends his home, his property and his friends.<br /><br />Realism although surreal, has our senses impacted when you see the results of fighting.  At times, it leads to more of the same.  Kowalski, though is a figure of redemption, he impacts everyone who knows him eventually, yet the most impact is on the viewer of Gran Torino.<br /><br />The extras in the DVD are good, more about cars than about society.  Wish there was more on the inner city and gang problems in this to complement our love affair with the big muscle cars.</p></body></html>

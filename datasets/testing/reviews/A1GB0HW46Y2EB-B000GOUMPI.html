<meta name="summary" content="The Shining in Blu-ray Worth the Trip"></head><body><p>Even though I've always had the highest regard for Stanley Kubrick's work, I do have mixed feelings for "The Shining". Even from the first viewing, I never felt that it terrified me as much as it should have.  But it is a film I do re-watch from time to time simply because visually, like most of Kubrick's films, it is so satisfying and the Blu-ray version is even more so.  I won't dwell on the screenplay or performances except to say that they are sometimes yes, sometimes no.  But the Blu-ray disc does bring out the technical achievements of the movie.  The cinematography is excellent as one would expect, but the frequent use of the Steadicam, being used here by Kubrick for the first time, does begin to call attention to itself.<br /><br />I'm glad the BD was released in the 1.78:1 aspect ratio since I'm  quite certain that it was presented in theaters using a 35mm print in 1.37:1 aspect and masked in the projector to get 1.78:1 or something close to it.  In the early aerial shot of the hotel as shown in the 1.33:1 DVD, the blades of the camera helicopter are clearly visible at the top of the frame.  I'm certain Kubrick would never have allowed this, given his attention to detail and I don't think that by 1980 there were many theaters in the U.S. showing movies in 1.37:1.  The video quality of the Blu-ray release is impressive in its clarity, color balance and freedom from graininess and the helicopter blades are nowhere to be seen.<br /><br />Somehow I get the impression that the musical portion of the soundtrack is a little too much of a good thing having been, I believe, remixed at a higher volume level relative to the dialogue track for this release.  The music for this film was taken mostly from existing concert pieces by Bartok, Ligeti, et. al.  To have the greatest effect for this film, the music, in many places, should be rather quiet and needling rather than intrusive or overbearing as it often is.  Playing this film in a totally dark room and at a lower than usual audio level will help provide the feelings of uneasiness that the viewer should have.<br /><br />This release makes me pine for a Blu-ray release of Barry Lyndon.</p></body></html>

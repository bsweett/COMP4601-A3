<meta name="summary" content="A follow up...not decent, but not terrible. (Book 1: Part 3 )"></head><body><p>So it is official Tony Stark is Iron Man and he has been given quite a task. What kind of a hero is he going to be and will he destroy himself in the process.<br /><br />This movie of course is only a small portion of what is on the way and now it is no longer a secret. In this movie Iron Man is being taken on by villains and heroes alike. There is a new villain out there who apparently had some connections with Tony's dad wants revenge. Because of his extra fame as an industrialist and a super-hero Nick Fury is trying to make sure that he doesn't get out of control even if it means taking him off the roster of the Avengers.<br /><br />I really can't figure out how to put this review together because that is pretty much what the movie was like. It was a great deal of fun, but it was very much reminiscent of a Jackson Pollock. Just throw your characters to the canvas and hopefully a story will pop out of it. Well thankfully the humor and the great action sequences were able to keep the crowd interested and the movie did make quite a large amount in the box office. Still, in my opinion Marvel has to keep their heads on strait and stick to the plan ahead. There is a monster movie franchise brewing here and if they keep putting together movies like Iron Man 2 people will get very skeptical about the future projects.</p></body></html>

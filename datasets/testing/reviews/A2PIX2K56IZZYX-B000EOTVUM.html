<meta name="summary" content="I'm having second thoughts about that hiking trip............"></head><body><p>Solid horror movie here people, well acted, good scares, decent suspense, beautifully shot, all in all a rather nice surprise. I remember seeing the previews some time last year and thinkin' that this had some potential. I then read up on the 'true events' that the movie was based on and it does give you a few chills when you think about it. In the early 90's seven hikers/backpackers were murdered in the Australian outback, it seems he liked to let them go after he caught and tortured them because he was fascinated with the 'chase'. Just remember this movie is loosely based on true events, most of it is just the deranged and psychotic antics of the director and writers, gotta love 'em.<br /><br />Three hikers travel to Wolf Creek to check out a stretch of land where a meteor crashed some years back, after a good hike and some makin' out they realize they can't leave 'cuz guess what? you got it, the old car-is-broke-in-the-middle-of-nowhere situation (really stretchin' the artistic mind there aren't they?) Anyway, along comes Mick Taylor, a dirty, scruffy old bushman who tells them he can fix it, but the parts are at his place. Much to everyone's surprise our young hikers agree to head on back to his place, and our fun is soon beginning. Seems Mick's 'pad' is an abandoned mine, real fixer-upper let me tell you. Then around the campfire during storytime, Mick drugs each one and they all wake up hours later alone and tied up.<br /><br />Our first victim is Liz, played by Cassandra Magrath, I'm not to familiar with her work, but she does a splendid job, great screamer and a pretty tough chick too!! She wakes up all tied up in this little room, she is able to free herself, but right before she decides to make a break for it she hears a terrifying scream coming from her best friend and victim #2, Kristy, also played very well by Kestie Morassi. This scream sent chills down my back people, I'm not kidding, a scream of complete suffering and horror. Liz soon finds Kristy being tortured rather brutally by Mick (this scene is not for the squeamish) Kristy and Liz then have a cat and mouse game With Mick for the next hour trying to escape, I won't tell you what happens to them but they do a superb lead-in to our last victim Ben, who is nailed to a cross, but he too also manages to escape. Ben is played by Nathan Phillips, although not as strong a performance as the ladies, he does an above-average job as well.<br /><br />The thing that really got me was how 'real' the two ladies were, the pain and suffering they feel you feel too. The absolute struggle between life and death is brilliantly played out by all involved, and that alone makes it a cut above the usual slashers. Another reason it works so well is John Jarratt playing Mick Taylor, what a complete psycho, and he hams it up like you wouldn't believe. I'm not sure how many of you saw the movie High Tension, but Jarratt's performance ranks right up there with the leading lady from that excellent horror movie as well. At first he comes across as this Crocodile Dundee type, then you see this dark and uncaring soul who totally gets off on pain and torture.<br /><br />This isn't as gory and graphic as everyone is saying, yes there is some, but it's not nearly as bad as Devil's Rejects or even High Tension. It gets you more with it's gritty realism, strong suspense and a building sense of dread as the movie wears on. Wolf Creek is so beautifully shot, the scenery and locations are incredible. All the scenes of the Australian mountains, sunsets, desert hi-way's are so colorfull and bright, but yet perfectly balanced with the dreary, grainy feel and look of Mick's mine and torture rooms. This movie won't scare the hell out of ya, but it sure will bring on some fun conversation. I rented History Of Violence with this, so I'll let ya know how that one is soon, later!!<br /><br />acting......4 stars, Don't recognize a single one but they sure got the job done.<br /><br />directing...4 stars, Very well done<br /><br />special effects....3.5 stars, Not many to be seen, but decent, the car and cliff scene is nifty to watch<br /><br />horror rating....4 stars, Will get ya talkin'<br /><br />quality....4.5 stars, One of the better looking horror movies I've seen is recent years, nearly flawless in presentation.</p></body></html>

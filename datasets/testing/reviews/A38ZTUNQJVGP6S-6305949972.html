The movie was initially to be released through Disney Studios, but the powers that be though that Nightmare was and I quote "too dark and scary for kids". Jack Skellington, The Pumpkin King, has just finished another Halloween and is depressed because it is the same old scare year after year; though the residents of Halloween Town enjoy it very much. Jack is looking for that something in his life and goes wondering off into the woods and find the holiday trees of Valentine Day, Easter, Saint Patrick Day, Thanksgiving, Halloween and Christmas. Each tree is a portal to that town and he accidently opens the Christmas Tree's portal door and gets sucked into Christmas Town. Jack is amazed at what he sees in Christmas Town; Christmas Town is the exact opposite of Halloween Town. In Christmas Town everybody is happy, building toys, and the smell of pie is everywhere. When Jack comes back to Halloween town and calls a town meeting, he tries to explain Christmas to the resident but the residents just cannot grasp it.<br /><br />Jack heads home and stays lock up in his lab trying to use a scientific approach to understand Christmas as well as performing experiments. Finally Jack is able to solve the problem about Christmas and announce to the residents of Halloween Town, who are witches, ghosts, vampires, zombies and bunch of other scary residents, that Christmas is ours this year. The only thing wrong with this picture is that the people who live in Halloween Town have live a life of scaring, doing creepy things, and being evil. They are unable to grasp the goodness of Christmas, but they do their best to try. The sleigh that Jack drives is coffin shaped and is pulled\flown by three skeleton reindeers; just to give you and example. Jack sends Lock, Shock and Barrel to snatch Santa Claus and bring him to Halloween Town. The three are able to find Santa Claus and hand him over to Oogie Boogie who begins to taunt him. Meanwhile Jack, along with his ghost dog Zero, flies off into the night sky with his bag of scary toys to hand out to the children of the world.<br /><br />Jack plans backfires when the parents inform the police of the phony Santa Clause and Jack's sleigh and reindeers are shot down from the sky. Jack realizes what he has done and head back to Halloween Town to rescue Santa Clause and set everything straight. Jack discovers that Santa Claus is held captive by Oogie Boogie and that Oogie Boogie is about to kill Santa Claus and Sally. Jack is able to rescue Santa Clause and Sally and defeats Oogie Boogie. In the end Santa Claus is able to restore Christmas and out the end of the movie it begins to snow and the residents begin to sing their version of What's This. Not since Mad Monster Party came out in 1967 has there been a stop motion picture been made; though I could be wrong.

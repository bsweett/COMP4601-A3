<meta name="summary" content="another weak translation of a TV classic . . ."></head><body><p>As original ideas are hard to come by, it seems that eventually most every successful `classic' television series will be considered as the basis for a feature film.  With a history of rather abysmal results through the years, some who are actually familiar with the subject programs, have come to expect very little of such projects.  The world is decidedly different some forty years later, and the film version of Get Smart, retains little of the relevance, and even less of the charm or humor of the original series.  Like so many other big screen adaptations, the film attempts to capitalize on whatever cache may remain in a classic franchise, utilizing just a few threads from the TV series.  As the target audience for the film are those who may never have seen Don Adams as Agent 86, Barbara Feldon as Agent 99, Ed Platt as The Chief, and Bernie Kopell as Siegfried, this lack of connection was probably deemed irrelevant.<br /><br />By making Max and 99 strangers, the heart of what made the original Get Smart so special is removed.  Instead of a warm familiarity, the characters start coldly at ground zero.  Besides his height, Steve Carell bears few similarities to the original Maxwell Smart.  Anne Hathaway may be talented and charming, but the version of 99 she is given, has little in common with Feldon's character.  There are winks and nods to the past; 86's red Tiger Sunbeam convertible and shoe phone, Agent 13 (Bill Murray) in a tree, Fang the dog, and Bernie Kopell's cameo, to name a few, but they really don't make any substantial contribution to the story.  With a skeleton framework, and main characters that are mere shells of the original, this Get Smart is firmly targeted for today's audience.<br /><br />As such, the film isn't very funny, and only because of a strong finish, is it even a halfway decent action/adventure flick.  Up until the setting shifts to Los Angeles, Max and 99, clash and step on each other toes.  Perhaps the only bit in the entire film that is humorous is the dance number at the party, and there again the two leads are going against each other.  The Chief (Alan Arkin), and Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson) are mainly on the bench until they get to LA, where their contributions do help rescue Get Smart from forgettable oblivion.  The filmmakers consulted with series creators Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, but it apparently didn't help much.  One good decision was to play down the delivery of Max's classic lines.<br /><br />The film can also be viewed in a mode where alternate takes and versions are inserted, supposedly providing '62% more laughs'.  That stated improvement is not only hyperbole, but is false.  The alternate gags usually aren't funny, and instead of being a positive, these lame alternates just confirm how badly the writers were lost, groping for the right words.  What is really unfortunate is that the producers apparently fail to understand that reinserting the discarded material, does not cast the film or the filmmakers in a better light.  Instead they both seem rather pathetic, similar to watching a standup comedian bomb over and over again, with bad joke after bad joke.<br /><br />Now that the premise has been set, a sequel is probably being planned.  Siegfried can be retrieved from the drink, and he and Starker could be featured more prominently.  Hymie should be good to go.  In the 'sensitive' villain Dalip (Dalip Singh), they have their version of Jaws (from the Roger Moore Bonds), primed for the next adventure.  Jaws did a parachute stunt in Moonraker, so next perhaps Dalip on a cable car?  Hopefully now that Agents 86 and 99 have developed a relationship, the writers will do a better job, because there is really huge room for improvement.</p></body></html>

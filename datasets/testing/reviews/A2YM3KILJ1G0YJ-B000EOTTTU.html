<meta name="summary" content="Beautifully filmed and slow moving exploration of American history"></head><body><p>Over an hour and a half into the movie, John Rolfe (Bale) drones, "Hours pass; she speaks no words," and therein lies the problem.  Like the slowly growing and mostly dying crops that did in the settlers of Jamestown, this movie dies because of malnutrition.  There's far too little <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A2WP7O">Last of the Mohicans</a>, and far too many panoramic views of a cinematographer's concept of early American wilderness (beautifully rendered) and indigenous buttocks.  The romance between John Smith (Farrell) and Pocahontas (Kilcher) is slower than a Special Olympic hurdler, and far too many scenes pass without a spoken word or consequential sound.  Honestly, the dialogue in this film must have been amazingly easy to memorize for the cast, because most of the long stretches of speaking parts seem to be done as voiceovers off camera.  And Colin Farrell STILL managed to utter his lines like he had a mouth full of marbles.  Aggravating is not a strong enough word, and the rest of the cast - aside from Christian Bale - is filled up of ambiguous Indians and random serfs.<br /><br />I appreciate the attempt at an authentic recreation and the historical significance of the story, but Pocahontas, much like the makers of this movie, made multiple mistakes, like I did when I decided to watch this...but hindsight is 20/20, I guess.<br /><br />Simply put, this is a watch once kind of movie.  Add in the historical inaccuracies, and I'd rather watch corn grow than sit through another viewing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Aliens vs Predator Rematch!"></head><body><p>We had mixed feelings for this latest movie. If you could mix and match both films, you could probably find a true Blockbuster hit film somewhere.<br /><br />But, as is, both films failed in certain ways when it comes to acting and directing and screenplays. Hollywood just can't seem to find directors nowadays to take this franchise into the stratosphere monetarily as it could. What, is there no Ridley Scott's or James Cameron's out there?<br /><br />But after reading the last two books of both franchise's - this movie started to look better. It actually has a bloody solid look to it, especially in terms of the twin alien creatures battling. It was the human cast of actors and horrible dialogue that truly threw this off the A-scale film it should have been.<br /><br />At least it was R-rated as it should be. And it did show scenes of pretty coolness, along with something different in terms of mixed creature feature - an alien mixed with a Predator! And he was pretty damn cool!<br /><br />Hopefully, someone in Hollywoodland, either a blooded director, or a young and intelligent director that knows what needs to be done, both in stronger screenplays and better actors, will come along and take this franchise where it truly belongs.<br /><br />Brothers Strauss did a good job, but not greatness like the first two feature films. Are all the great directors gone...?</p></body></html>

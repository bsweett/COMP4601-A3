<meta name="summary" content="TOP NOTCH FILM HAS IT ALL! WALKIN' THE MILE...WALKIN' THE MILE.."></head><body><p>One of the most engrossing and beautifully crafted films I've ever seen. Clocking in a little over three hours, this film never drags. Darabont's direction and screenplay are for at least a second time( The Shawshank Redemption) are at the top of all cinema. A great story that unfolds like you are reading a book with well developed characters who aren't all bad or all good. One of Tom Hanks best performances(I guess since 'Forrest Gump' beat out 'The Shawshank Redemption' for best picture Darabont wanted to use a star with Academy appeal?)ditto, Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse and a cast of top notch character actors including Sam Rockwell, Doug Hutchison and Michael Jeter. I recently bought the Blu Ray edition which is well worth the upgrade, the picture and sound are a big improvement over the DVD( and the film isn't on two discs)with all the extras carried over from the two disc DVD including some documentaries deleted scenes and commentary.</p></body></html>

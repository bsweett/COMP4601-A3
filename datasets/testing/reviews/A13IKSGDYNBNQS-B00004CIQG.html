<meta name="summary" content="Very Black Comedy"></head><body><p>Naturally from an acting point of view Peter Sellers dominates this film. Playing three roles: The RAF Captain, US President Muffley and Dr Stranglove. Each is a comedic performance of brilliance. The RAF Captain is the voice of sanity to Sterling Haydens's mad US General. Its more than just a funny performance, Sellers acting portrays a desperation in his dealings with Gen Jack D Ripper. Having said that Sellers dominates, don't think this is one-man show. Both Sterling Hayden and George C Scott give stand-out performances.<br /><br />The film is full of great visual gags and some wonderful one-liners. "No fighting in the war room" being a favourite of mine.<br /><br />The film satarises the cold war paranoia of the 60's and was made soon after the Cuban missile crisis.<br /><br />Of course we mustn't forget the mastermind behind the film - Stanley Kubrick. He directed and co-wrote the film. In some of the brief attack scenes on the airbase you can see how he would later shoot Full Metal Jacket. It is an endlessly watchable film that any sane person will want to own!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Savage, brutal, but ultimately nonsensical rubbish."></head><body><p>I must confess that I had high hopes for "High Tension".  The brutal killing of the family was quite savage and disturbing.  However, when examining "High Tension" on its merits as a horror movie, there simply are no redeeming qualities.  What is scary about this movie?????  Granted the violence against a mother, her child and husband might be disturbing and horrifying in a sense, but how is this movie scary to an audience?  It simply is not scary at all.<br /><br />When I finished watching this movie, I turned the TV on and caught the tale end of Alfred Hitchcock's classic horror-suspense movie called "Psycho".  I've seen "Psycho" a hundred times, but it is such a great horror movie, and it is smart, atmospheric, suspenseful and scary.  Movies like "Psycho" remind me why I love horror movies so much, but today's new age horror just fails to deliver the goods like the classics.<br /><br />"High Tension" is about a couple of girls who want to get away from all distraction so they can study for exams.  However, all is not quite what it seems to be when a killer breaks in and brutally murders several people...although, clearly, this movie should have kept the plot simple.  "High Tension" is all about shock and awe horror which employs graphic violence and disturbing imagery to shock the conscience of the audience, but there is not one thing scary about this movie if you think about it.  Where are the scares?  You might be disturbed by this movie, but you won't find anything scary about "High Tension".<br /><br />Also, the twist at the end just made things even worse in my opinion.  I agree with the above reviewer that this was not necessary or effective...ultimately, this twist makes the movie much worse than it already was to begin with because it becomes completely nonsensical rubbish by movie's end with this ill-advised twist.  Indeed, the makers of this movie should have kept it as simple as possible notwithstanding the movie's fundamental flaw of relying on extreme violence and gore to instill horror in the audience.<br /><br />Perhaps some people find this kind of movie entertaining, but these new age horror movies like the "Saw" movies, "High Tension", "Hostel", and "Cabin Fever" aren't scary at all, but are only designed to shock the audience with graphic violence and excessive gore.  "High Tension" is just another example of the direction that today's cinematic horror is going.  The problem is that these movies are a dime a dozen, and are sorely lacking in creativity and atmospheric elements which are crucial to any horror movie's success.</p></body></html>

Intrigue is the film's hallmark.  To be brief, we start out with the murder of a professor who is a link to a "code" kept secret by Bishop Manuel Aringarosa (A ring around Rosa-!) (Alfred Molina, also "Doctor Oct," `Spiderman II') who is the ecclesial leader of Opus Dei, a secret sect of the Catholic Church.  To cover their crimes, they frame American Professor Langdon (Tom Hanks), who can't help but become a reluctant investigator. He links with Agent Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), the granddaughter of the slain professor.  From the murder's beginning, they are surrounded at the Louvre Museum by the police and the bishop's protege', Silas (Paul Bettany), a cruel and misguided murderer.  It provides for a continuing and suspenseful chase.  The drama unfolds a "treasure hunt" as Langdon relates, and we are fed clues to keep our interest going.  Being an expert at historical symbols, Langdon correctly keeps the chase going to crack "the code" with Da Vinci leading the way with clever clues.  When stumped we come into the company of Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellan) whose offering is the crux of `The Da Vinci' controversy.  The suspenseful and absorbing chase is interrupted periodically by flashbacks meant to psychoanalyze the key players with backgrounds of faith that are tainted by abuse and misfortune.  (Certainly, the self-immolation of Silas is linked to a faith fostered by abuse.  Or at least he didn't take St. Ignatius's advice that these acts of penance are meant to be a gesture of repentance--not a means of self-torture.)  The resolution is a mixed bag:  It provides answers but is less awe-inspiring than the suspense that precedes it.<br /><br />Appeal will be mixed.  As entertainment, it sustains a mysterious atmosphere and a harrowing chase.  Splitting with the movie has to do with its controversial rendering.  Most people agree that Professor Teabing is the novelist Dan Brown's mouthpiece.  For those who believe the story is historical fiction, they are delighted at the iconoclastic nature of the movie.  For those who believe the story is fanciful fiction are often infuriated with the film.  Sir Teabing says the Catholic Church is an agent of "oppression and brutality" and asks, "What if the greatest story ever told is a lie?"  He refers to the bible.  Tom Hanks, as the modern equivalent of the James Stewart everyman, says "We've been dragged into a world where people believe it's [the Holy Grail] real?"  The bottom line is "Believe what you want to believe," which is borrowing a line from the Moody Blues who said, "...And we decide which is right and which is an illusion."<br /><br />(Let the Christians be offended.  After all, what if the movie was switched and we had the same movie with clues to show that Moses was really gay, or Mohammed frequented brothels?  Could this be passed off as "fiction," fanciful or historical?  The Dutch cartoonists last spring suggest that it could not.)</p></body></html>

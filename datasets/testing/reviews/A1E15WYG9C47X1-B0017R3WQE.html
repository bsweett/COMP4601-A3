<meta name="summary" content="Aged Classic"></head><body><p>I watched Scarface a long time ago,and considered it to be one of the classics of cinema, a film of sheer raw power, unrelenting in its brutality, with no redemption to any of the characters involved in this dangerous drugs game.<br />Then, few years have passed before I watched it again. Now, more mature and with hundreds of movies later, I did see some flaws and made few observations which I would like to share it with you.<br />It is still a wonderfully made, or shall I say remade movie, and Al Pacino's performance, although somewhat over the top in places, is a powerhouse of 'method' acting. Many of his lines in Scarface have entered history, and his portrayal of Cuban Refugee Tony Montana, with all the successes, excesses and failures, is mind blowing. Yet the film has not aged very well.<br />It is first and foremost a child of its time,the eighties, despite the fact that Scarface is a remade of Howard Hawks original.<br />Another observation, revolves around the film's violence. Scripted by none other than Mr Oliver Stone who shocked audiences later with his own Natural Born Killers, there is too much graphic violence, and so much blood to make even Dario Argento squirm. True,this violence reflects the brutal and very dangerous world of drug trafficking, however,the power of suggestion and psychological violence ala Don Siegel, could have worked equally well in balanced propotions.<br />My universal one million dollar movie question has always been why on earth censors allow so much gore and blood and F words, yet cry murder at any sign of equally graphic nudity and invent new classification for it (NC17).<br />The last observation I would like to make, revolves around the final scene. I believe that scene, although very powerful and memorable, as many would consider it an all time classic, was hastily filmed. The failure of the an assasination attempt in the morning,because Montana got a soft spot for the family in the car of the target,he gets a threatening 'I will show you you so and so' type of call in the afternoon from the Latin drug lord Suza, and few hours later, hundreds of gun totting latinos storm the not so well protected mansion to kill Montana.My first thought was, where did all these guys come from?? Where is the security that the paranoid Montana insisted on and paid so much for? I would imagine a guy like him would have literaly an whole army!!<br />The always excellent M-E Mastrantoni last scene is over the top, and Montana talking to his dead sister in a shocked and drugged insanity is too sentimental, given the development and pace of this last scene.<br />All supporting actors are great, from Mastrantonio, to Steven Bauer, to the highly underrated Robert Loggia, and of course the then unknown Michelle Pfeiffer in one of her earliest roles.<br />Now finally few words about Brian De Palma. I have truly mixed feelings about De Palma.On one hand, he can be considered as a Hitchcok wannabe with films like Body Double, Sisters, Obsession and Dressed To Kill, and on the other as an original film maker with gems like the underrated cult classic Phantom of Paradise, Mission Impossible and Carrie.<br />With Scarface, although a remade and not original film as stated above, you can clearly see his and Stone's prints all over it.<br />So notwithstanding my observations about Scarface, it is still a very good entertaining film, and this is what is important after all. You can suspend belief and excuse the flaws in it, but if you are still entertained by genuis performances and able direction then it certainly should be in your collection.</p></body></html>

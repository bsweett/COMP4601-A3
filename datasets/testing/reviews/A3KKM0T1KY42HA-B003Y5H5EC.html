<meta name="summary" content="On Ice"></head><body><p>Wow. Talk about puttin' someone on ice! In Hard Candy Ellen Page (Hayley) puts Patrick Wilson's character (Jeff) on ice in the figurative and literal sense of the phrase.<br /><br />Page is young looking enough to play 14 year old Hayley who takes vigilantism to a tortuous level in Hard Candy. Page was actually 18 when Hard Candy was released. But Page's character has a major flaw: it's one of those characters that is completely unbelievable...you know, super-intellect for a teenager with (seemingly) superpowers.<br /><br />Director David Slade, a directorial youngster himself, could have made a much more realistic movie if he had just made his diabolical leading lady equally vindictive but a little more naive. Instead, Page's character Hayley comes across as a 30-something year old with a Masters in English Debate that's been through boot camp. Simply far fetched.<br /><br />Patrick Wilson (memorable for his 2004 film version performance in Phantom of the Opera) saves the film from unrealistic disaster as relatively believable in his role as 32 year old underage-girl-lover Jeff.<br /><br />Page and Wilson occupy the screen for 98% of the movie. The dialogue between the two is fast and keeps you watching. The torture is mostly left to the viewer's imagination; Hard Candy is not a bloody movie. It's a movie about revenge that is designed to stir the debate over the definition of who constitutes a criminal...the villain?...the vigilante?...or both?<br /><br />Overall, I was entertained. My wife's summation: "Where do you find these movies?"<br /><br />Hard Candy is fair rental if you've seen everything else that you want to see.</p></body></html>

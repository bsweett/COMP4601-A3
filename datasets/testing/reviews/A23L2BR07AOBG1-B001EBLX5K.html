One reason it doesn't reach that greatness is because it combines the original concept of doing interviews with real people who are unaware it's a sham with footage of Borat with another actor, and these scenes don't really work for me in contrast with the rest of the film.  I just feel it works best in "Da Ali G Show." For me, the best part in the film was with the Frat boys in the RV who watch the DVD with him and his heart breaks, this is just classic.  Another thing that worked great for me on the DVD was the compilation of the press footage Borat got. His appearances on Jay Leno and Conan are worth the price of the DVD alone and show just how far this man will go with people who may, or may not know how far that is, something that was not as central in the movie. To me, that's the appeal of every character in "Da Ali G show" and especially Borat since he plays off the the whole culture clash sensitivity and shows just how sensitive people are and how much some people try to hide it, just for the sake of a foreigner. Overall, it's not a bad purchase, but I wouldn't recommend it for the movie, but for the extras (which are few, but good). I would also like to say that whoever does the music at the beginning and end of the film, is a comic genius, and hits exactly the right WRONG notes, if you know what I mean.

That's just me to me it is a trilogy Manhunter Silence Of The Lambs & Hannibal. Hannibal Rising directed by Peter Webber who I hope this is the only movie I ever watch that you have directed. Thomas Harris himself wrote the screen play & Dino De Laurntiis produces for the last time. It stars Gaspard Ulliel as a Young Hannibal & Lo Gong as Murasaki there the only decent thing about this movie  the dumb a  s  s who played Jigsaw in Punisher War Zone Dominic West in this. You start off in 1944 the Lecter family during the end of WW II in Lithuania the whole family is killed except for Hanninbal & his little sister SS forces cannibalize the girl. Hannibal is later found by Soviet Forces the Lecter Castle has been turned into an orphange 8 years later Hannibal has been rendared mute due to tramatic experances & later escapes to Paris to live with his Aunt she helps him speak again. We get Hannibal going for revenge Crow or Punisher style I'm sorry but I'm supppose to care about this character I know it is a prequel but this character who would go on to serve human to party guests drove Will Graham to insanity had Dr Chilton for dinner savaged the gaurds in Silence cooked Ray Liotta's brain which we will never forget for different reasons & we are suppose to pity poor Hannibal. The Boogeyman should remain The Boogeyman the tramatic childhood stuff worked for Francis Dollarhyde & Jame Gumb but it doesn't for Hannibal. It is just what it is cliche. This movie is so slow paced & I don't mind slow paced movies as long as the characters keep me involved but out of all 5 films this has the most forgettable character & forgetable score. I guess I can say it is shot well but so was The NOES remake & I don't think much of Samuel Bayer as a director. According to Thomas Harris he was in fear of them writing a prequel cause Dino De Laurntiis said "If you don't write it I'll do it with someone else. I don't want to lose this franchise & the audience they want it." It was made out of greed. Harris shouldn't of done it he wouldn't have had to take the blame for a s h i  t t y novel. He could've wrote some kind of Hannibal sequel I know Anthony Hopkins wasn't going to come back but they could've got Brian Cox back. The gore isn't impressive either. After this orgins story you'll have to check into Orgins.</p></body></html>

I seem to remember watching people playing around with fireworks at our neighbor's house. But I'm not 100% sure these memories are accurate.<br /><br />The first memory I know for sure is accurate is seeing "Star Wars" in 1977. This was back when it was just "Star Wars". Not "Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope". No, it was just a simple, single film.<br /><br />But what a film it was! I am pretty sure I'd seen movies in theatres before this one, but I don't remember doing so. The first movie I remember seeing after this one is "Star Trek: The Motion Picture". When I got a little older, I remember being very happy every time I went to visit my Aunt Judy because she had HBO, and there was a decent chance they'd be showing Star Wars, so I'd get to see it again. When Christmas and birthdays rolled around, one of the things I'd always ask for was "Star Wars" action figures. My mom always made me use a magic marker to color their feet black so they wouldn't get mixed up with any owned by any of the neighbor kids.<br /><br />Through the 1980's a lot of my life centered around the "Star Wars" films. I remember seeing "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi" when they were first in theatres. Hell, I've even seen the abortion best known to the world as The Star Wars Holiday Special!<br /><br />I provide this rather lengthy digression because I want to make it clear that this movie has had a huge impact on my life, and that's something reasonably common to my generation. We're called "Generation X", but in many ways we're really the "Star Wars" Generation. The earliest members of the generation would've been only twelve or thirteen when the first movie came out. The last ones were born when "Return of the Jedi" was still fresh.<br /><br />With Star Wars George Lucas managed to take several diverse elements (mythology, Japanese cinema, westerns, etc), and combine them into a film that was truly universal in nature. You can take the movie to just about anywhere in the world and people will recognize elements familiar to them, even if they've never seen the movie before.<br /><br />Even now, thirty-one years after the movie first premired, it's casting a shadow over the world of film. Along with such movies as "The Birth of a Nation" and "Citizen Kane", it completely recreated the way movies are made. Certainly it's one of the most influential films ever made. It's also far more accessible than either of those other two great movies.<br /><br />Of course no real reflection on this movie could go by without taking notice of the amazing score by John Williams. Even now, I bet you can remember the sound of the music playing as Luke looked out at the twin suns setting, or the music playing as everyone but Chewbacca got medals, and of course you'll remember the amazing theme to the film's opening titles. The film's score gave a gravitas to science fiction music that had been previously reached only by "2001 - A Space Odyssey" (a film not nearly as good and very overrated), and even that movie's score was made impressive by the fact that it was lifted from the classical masters.<br /><br />Of course back in 1997, many fans screamed, "Murther! Murther most foul!" when George Lucas released the special edition versions of the movies with enhanced special effects and the like. Me, I like the special edition versions of all three movies, especially the first. They don't change the story any, they are prettier to look at, and it was nice to see the movies in the theatres again.<br /><br />The film is not without flaws. The dialogue is a little clunky and wooden (to those bitching about the prequels being shallow on the dialogue, I suggest you go back and listen to the first three films again). The characters are pretty one-dimensional for the most part.<br /><br />But despite those flaws, the movie is spectacular, and even now has an impact that cannot be underestimated. I remember a few years ago, after it had first come out on DVD, I had a couple friends over for Christmas. We were talking, playing video games and just generally goofing around. While we were eating, I popped on the movie, and even though we'd all seen it a half a gazillion times, we were still enthralled and gave it our almost undivided attention to a film that came out in 1977. Now that's praise!<br /><br />This isn't the best film in the sextology. That honor goes to The Empire Strikes Back. But it is the most important film, and one of the best movies ever made.<br /><br />With this DVD you get the original film and you get the special edition version that was created for the original DVD release back in 2004. Which is better? Eh, honestly I prefer the special edition version, but that's just me. Either way, it's a wonderful buy.</p></body></html>

I believed her-her style came off as natural and not 'look-at-me-I'm-acting'.  The actor portraying Prince Charles came off as a mimic to me.  As for the movie's content and it's overall entertainment value, I agree with the reviewer in this felt more like something you'd watch on A & E's Biography or Public TV.  I was fine paying three bucks for a rental than the double digits one would pay at the theater.  Take a peek and judge for yourself-I just suggest you go the rental route like I did.</p></body></html>

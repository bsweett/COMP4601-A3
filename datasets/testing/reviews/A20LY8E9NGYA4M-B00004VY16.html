<meta name="summary" content="GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS, FAST PACE, AMUSING MOVIE."></head><body><p>"The Mummy" is not a mere remake, because although it's slightly based in the 1932 movie, this version is completely different, the special effects in 1999 were sufficiently advanced to make a spectacular movie. And in my opinion, the remakes should be done this way, writing new stories, adding more things, but respecting the original idea. When Hollywood tries to make a remake step by step, it usually is a fatal mistake, just take a look to "Psycho (1998)", it's a lame version of Hitchcock's original version.<br /><br />"The Mummy" is one of the quintessential summer movies of recent years, it's fast paced, it has amazing special effects, it has humor, it has colorful characters, and it has a beautiful heroine Evelyn (played by Rachel Weisz), a brave girl that combines charm, exotic beauty and courage. The hero John Hannah (played by Brendan Fraser) is a combination of Indiana Jones and George Of The Jungle.<br /><br />Fraser doesn't have the typical physical aspect of Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Eastwood or Ford, but he does a good job in "The Mummy", and it's a welcome change to the typical movie hero. The movie has a lot of interesting visual effects, specially when Imhotep uses the sand to create a giant version of his face.<br /><br />"The Mummy" loses some steam when it becomes too repetitive in some scenes, but overall this is entertainment, and it's noticeable that the director, the cast and the crew of "The Mummy" made a modern version of an old movie with good results. A very amusing movie.</p></body></html>

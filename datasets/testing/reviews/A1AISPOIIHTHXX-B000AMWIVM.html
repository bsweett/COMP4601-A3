Sure the acting is a little rough but it's a horror movie, not an Oscar contender. The film loses steam halfway through only to pick up at the end so it's not a thrill ride from beginning to end. It's got incredibly fast editing with a jerky image at times so it's obviously trying to make things more exciting than it needs too. But in the end it's a pretty satisfying film if you let it.<br /><br />The film opens with an odd idea: 2 men are chained up on opposite ends of a really dank and decrepit bathroom. In the middle is a guy with a gunshot wound in his head, a gun in one hand, a tape recorder in the other. After some searching they find out why they're there: a killer nicknamed Jigsaw put them there and wants one of them to kill the other or his wife and daughter will die. There's clues all around them to get out, including tools for one method that's quite grisly.<br /><br />You can tell there's a certain enthusiasm with this: the film doesn't have a sense of an obvious independent film as it's smartly written and has quite an ending(although it probably won't make sense). There is some gore in the film but it's not outright gory except for a few shots. In fact, except for those certain shots it's kind of tame at times. The unrated adds some extra footage but I honestly couldn't figure out where the new stuff was.<br /><br />Acting wise well..., don't forget that this is an independent film shot incredibly quickly so there's bound to be some performances that are kinda eek. The writing's pretty sharp although at times it's quite illogical. Pretty soon a character's like "wait a minute, I know this!" to actually explaining certain obvious parts. But all the clues and hidden things are clever but like I said, some are kind of like "well he figured that out pretty quickly".<br /><br />Like the other big Sundance film Blair Witch Project, it's a film that seemed refreshing and well-liked despite its flaws. I wouldn't blind buy this in case you don't like it but if you rent it and like, well why not keep it?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tell Me What You See"></head><body><p>Sometimes appears a thriller that relies more on character development and a good, gripping story than in continuous twists and trite action sequences. &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; is such a case, where Robin Williams creates a powerful character as Sy Barret, a lonely man who works at a photo department in a store. As time goes by, Sy starts to care more and more about a family he met through his job. Slowly, that care becomes an obsession, and we see there`s something terribly wrong.<br />Mark Romanek has directed a few videoclips and creates a stylish, absorbing mood for the movie, capturing the dysfunction and alienation of its main character. &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; is a slow, low key though interesting movie that has something to say about today`s society, and despite its somewhat anticlimatic ending still leaves the viewer think about the way he lives and acts with those who surround him. A worthwhile watch and a deep, strong character study.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good look at arms dealing; Cage almost there as usual"></head><body><p>I liked this on the whole; when the script is good and the director wrote it, things often turn out well. LOW tries to be balanced and not too preachy; the rationalizations actually make some sense. The film downplays the political connections more than is likely true, though, I'd guess (destabilization of third world countries is one of the CIA's favorite tactics, as revealed by many ex-agents in many books, as is the Agency's drug-dealing as a method of both "insurgent" funding and arms trading, as revealed in the Iran/Contra hearings).<br /><br />My main qualm is with Cage, who somehow always seems to invest his characters with less brains and savvy than they deserve. It worked great in Raising Arizona but is wearing thin since then. He's kind of like the unthinking man's James Caan. Cage comes so close sometimes, but I just can't buy him all the way. Here he is solid but never transcends and takes this movie to the next level.<br /><br />Leto is good, as are most of the bit players, especially some of the Africans, who have more presence than some of the stars.<br />LOW does get pretty violent. The violence rarely seems gratuitous, though, so its point gets made.<br />Worth seeing.</p></body></html>

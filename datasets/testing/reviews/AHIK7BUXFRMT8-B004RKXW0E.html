<meta name="summary" content="May Intimidate Some Children"></head><body><p>As usual the quality of production is outstanding; the audio and video is completely satisfying.<br /><br />The story continues as Andy gets ready to leave for college; the big question for the toys is what will happen to them. The development of this theme provides the story line for the movie.<br /><br />There are many adventures and misadventures as the future for Andy's toys is played out; new characters are introduced along with some seriously threatening situations for the toys. The drama of some of these threats can produce concern for some children; this has a number of sections that place the toys in great peril.<br /><br />The intensity of these threats may be upsetting to some children; it may be well to rent this one before you buy if your main audience is children.<br /><br />From a collectors viewpoint, this is a must have film; this appears to wrap up this phase of the toys lives leaving the toys in a peaceful, happy situation. So the end does bring resolution for the toys but only after some fairly big time adventures.<br /><br />I'm delighted to have it as an addition to my collection!</p></body></html>

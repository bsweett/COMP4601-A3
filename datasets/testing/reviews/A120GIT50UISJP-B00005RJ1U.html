<meta name="summary" content="An effective coming-of-age tale with a terrible title"></head><body><p>As ridiculous a title as this movie has, you might assume that it's a teen slasher gore-fest. But the graphic violence is minimal, and much emphasis is placed on the relationship between the two adolescent siblings, Trish and Darry. Their sibling rivalry, with its petty bickering and silly games that only the two of them understand is refreshingly accurate, and they don't become all lovey-dovey when trouble comes their way.<br /><br />And trouble they have. A demon who, according to psychic Jezelle [Patricia Belcher] is permitted to feed for 23 days every 23 years is on day 22 of its eating binge. It captures young healthy people whose scent makes it wild with desire. It takes only certain parts, eyes to help it see, hearts to help its own heart stay strong and beating, and so on. Then it sews up the corpses to preserve them in a quilt, which it keeps in the basement of an old church (desecrated, no doubt). When Trish and Derry see one of the demon's sewn up, quilt-bound bodies dropped through an old pipe that leads into the basement of the church, they feel compelled to go back and see if they can help the victim. But the victim is beyond help, and now the demon has their scent, and it loves what it smells of one of them--which one, we do not know. But the demon is after them as a final addition to its collection.<br /><br />Along the way, Trish and Darry never suddenly turn into best friends--they annoy the heck out of each other up until the very end. But they do band together, as siblings will, and their private games and one-ups-manship tells us that their relationship is deeper than either would admit. The love-hate feelings of siblings is very well done, and is one of the highlights of the movie. Too, like most horror movies with teen protagonists, we never see parents, and parents would be of no help. This movie, and others like it are an allegory for the transition to adulthood that we all must make on our own.<br /><br />I do wish they'd thought more about the title, but Jeepers Creepers is an effective coming-of-age movie, with authentic characterizations and a fairy tale plot in a modern setting, with the traditional fairy tale goal--make the transition alive.</p></body></html>

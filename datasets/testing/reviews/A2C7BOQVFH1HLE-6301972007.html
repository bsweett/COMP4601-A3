<meta name="summary" content="Film Noir is Born!  Excellent Detective Movie but Too Bad About the DVD!"></head><body><p>Like a true classic should this movie seems to improve with each successive viewing.  The acting is great and so is the directing leaving me unsurprised that it's ranked among the top quarter of the American Film Institute's 100 Greatest American Films list.  The only problem I have is with the quality of the DVD; the picture quality isn't very good and the sound quality although Dolby Digital is in Mono.  Perhaps with the advent of Blu-Ray, a newer, better restored version will surface with good quality surround sound options perhaps DTS with THX for instance.<br /><br />Overall, this a a great movie but I'd recommend waiting for a better quality DVD version to come out. Hope it's soon!<br /><br />Updated 20 April 2011:<br /><br />Amazon won't allow me to review this separately and so I'll have to do it here.  The blu-ray version of this great film is astounding!  The picture and sound quality is vastly improved over the dvd and is the best restored old black and white film I've seen to date.  The difference is like night and day and the only regret that I have is that WB didn't also make this a picture book release like they did with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0033AI4AW">Mutiny on the Bounty [Blu-ray Book</a>] and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KVZ6LQ">King Kong [Blu-ray Book</a>].  That would have made this blu-ray release perfect.  Still, this is now the definitive and the best version of this great film to date.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!</p></body></html>

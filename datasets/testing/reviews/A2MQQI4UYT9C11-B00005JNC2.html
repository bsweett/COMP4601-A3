<meta name="summary" content="I Love Natalie Portman"></head><body><p>My choice in "romantic comedy weekend" (vs. wife's "Spanglish") was "Garden State", directed, written by and starring Zach Braff, has a promising future in the business. My wife only hung in thru about 10 minutes, though I encouraged her to give the rest of the movie a chance as it really picked up once Natalie Portman got involved as Braff's new girlfriend. It's nice to know that she got such a fun role after (before?) suffering through her time as queen in Star Wars the last. The whole film has a grittier feel than "Spanglish", which helped make it more to my taste. It's R-rated, but aside from a few "MF's" and some fairly substantial drug and alcohol use in the first 10 minutes, the story's probably OK for kids down to 11 or 12 (at least by my standards). The movie also has an interesting mental health aspect at its core and should appeal to those who've lived with someone who's under a psychiatrist's care.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Why Did She Recommend This?"></head><body><p>My mother recommended this movie to me with a big, sappy grin on her face. I shrugged and took it home to watch her copy, and the entire time I was watching it, I was thinking "Why did she buy this movie?" I won't be mean about this rating (although I laughed HARD at the one-star rating reviews--those folks should be poetry comedians with their metaphors for this film), but I will be honest. The movie is about two single people who currently have someone in their lives, but really don't want them to be there. Alex pretty much blows off the potential woman in his life, and Kate does just about the same in a harsher manner. They both end up living at a lake house two years apart and find out that both of them are traveling through time, one is going backwards and the other forward. There is a serious issue as to why they can't meet, but they can write each other. Will they eventually meet? Can they stop the serious issue?<br /><br />Pros: I thought the idea of writing a person you're interested in back and forth to get to know them nonphysically was such a great idea. If you can fall in love with a person's personality, chances are that it might be that much easier to fall in love with their looks (or at least accept them). From watching "Speed," I already wanted them to be together (in real life too) because I think they are a very attractive couple and have great chemistry onscreen.<br /><br />Cons: As soon as the birthday party happened, this movie lost me altogether. Who in their right mind goes to a party, sits outside with a stranger, slow dances out of nowhere, and then starts kissing with their boyfriend not even a few feet away? The restaurant issue made me go "So what?" I was frustrated because I couldn't understand a word that Kate's mother was saying because her accent was incredibly heavy. I could've cared less about Kate's boyfriend because his character was stoic.  To top it off, the movie was extremely predictable.<br /><br />MidPoint: I gave this movie two stars instead of one (even though I didn't care for it) because the casting directors picked the right two people to do this movie. No matter how much I didn't like the plot, I still like both of these actors and their relationship on camera. I also very much enjoyed the tree symbolism and the lakehouse was beautiful (although insane to have in Chicago weather). I wouldn't dare watch the movie again, but I can see why my mother would love something like this. People who like really sappy romance movies will probably enjoy this one. Dog lovers may like it too because this movie once again made me remember why I'm mad at my real estate company for not allowing me to have a big dog.  The dog in this movie was so cute! Five stars for the dog!</p></body></html>

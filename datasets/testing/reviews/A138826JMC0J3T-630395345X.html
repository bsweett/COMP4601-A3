<meta name="summary" content="Pulp Fiction"></head><body><p>Like some of Taratino's films, this one is no exception to his "random acts" style of film (ex: how the film isn't straight through and how scenes are in different order like in RESERVOIR DOGS).<p>This one's got several scenes like that that seem a bit random but when the movie ends, and you put all of the scenes together you think nothing less than "WOW!". Honest to God, this is a great film and it's really funny as well. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are great together in this one. Along with an All-Star cast of Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, Eric Stolts, Tarantino himself, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Bruce Willis, you can't go wrong!<p>This is a definite pick up! There is a lot of swearing in this one and also some drug ise and it's violent too but other than that, a great film and easily out of all of Taratino's movie, PULP FICTION is one of his best! Also check out RESERVIOR DOGS, DUSK TILL DAWN and for a great laugh from Tarantino, check out FOUR ROOMS!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Unforgiven"></head><body><p>The craggy, mellowing Eastwood directs himself admirably in this first-class oater. It's scenic, true to the period and includes excellent support from Freeman, Hackman and the late Richard Harris in a particularly showy role. With the dark and atmospheric "Unforgiven," Eastwood carries on the western film tradition in winning style.</p></body></html>

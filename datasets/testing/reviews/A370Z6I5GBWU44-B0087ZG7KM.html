This is a 'chick flick', but it has sex, vomiting, and explosive crapping in it. However, none of this is shown in graphic detail like you would see in a 'guy flick', you do not see any throwing up or any gross bits, all of it is covered up, and that was what made it funny without being gross (and the reason behind the vomiting and etc are plausible)<br /><br />However, I did not like how the movie ended, it started off very strong but ended on a somewhat weak note. I was prepared to give five stars, but the ending wasn't that good.<br /><br />There's one thing that bothers me - the pink dresses on the cover of this DVD are never seen in the movie itself. Yes, it's a minor quibble and doesn't affect the movie itself, but why use a different set of dresses that is never used in the movie? It'd be nice of the cover actually matched the movie!</p></body></html>

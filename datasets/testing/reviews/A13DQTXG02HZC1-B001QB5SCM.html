As the Director said himself in the interview, he didn't want the audience to be conscious of the decisions that he made but all those subtle things in the movie such as arts chosen, the usage of mirror, the choice of camera used, the debate of either using a mutt or pure bred dog to play Honey Bun 2 was discussed openly.  By the time we watch the movie, we have a keener observation and appreciate it even more.  The director does play a pivotal role in ensuring that the actors and actresses conveyed their scenes by not overplayed their characters and all of them didn't disappoint.  The storyline never condescended any people in particular but it simply rolled on smoothly to see how people deal with their inner demons, self-esteem, and subsequently, finding a way to know be in touch with their inner selves and thus, learning to forgive and reconcile with themselves and their loved ones and moving on with their lives.  It has been a long time coming that a Hollywood movie manages to pull my heart string and truth to be told, it's brilliant.  To much my surprise, Ridley Scott is one of the executive producer.  Perhaps, that's just a hint of quality and perfection in finer details.  A movie that shall not be missed and a movie to be shared with the loved ones.  It is very relevant to modern days relationship.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

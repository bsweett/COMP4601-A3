One year after Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, now you may ask why that's so important, because steven spielberg thought that Temple of Doom was too violent. And asked that ratings board to come up with a rating between PG and R, thus PG-13 was born. Goonies is PG, I won't go through the plot since that's been done a thousand times. This was one of my favorite movies growing up as a child, and now that I'm married with a child on the way. I hope this movie becomes one of her favorites, who didn't dream of finding a pirate treasure map, following it. Going through all those traps, and finding the ship at the end, with all that gold. Priceless, considering it's directed by the same man who directed Superman The movie. Dick Donner himself, I would give this movie more stars if i could. Would I sit my two year old, or three old in front of it, no. But i would sit my seven year old in front of it. This is the perfect movie to watch on a rainy day, it gets the imagination going. I can say nothing but good things about this movie. Plus Lyle Alzado is in it as Sloth.</p></body></html>

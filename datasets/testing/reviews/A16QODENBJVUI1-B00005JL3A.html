<meta name="summary" content="Way above average video game adaptation"></head><body><p>In the never-ending effort to find new material for movies, the industry has gone to a whole host of new media over the past 2 or 3 decades to include graphic novels, video and computer games, and even theme park rides.  Perhaps not surprisingly game adaptations have been perhaps the least success of all the films based on new sources.  Almost without exception movies based on console or computer games have been unspeakably awful.  RESIDENT EVIL, while not a great movie, nonetheless manages to be perhaps the best that the genre has produced.  It has, moreover, provoked two sequels that are both arguably better than the film that started it off.<br /><br />I have not played RESIDENT EVIL (apart from RPGs like Dungeon Siege and Elderscrolls and especially MMORPGs like Asheron's Call and World of Warcraft I generally avoid games), so I don't know how closely this film adheres to its storyline, but you constantly feel the restrictions of a highly predetermined story line.  The entire film -- unlike the sequel -- feels as if it is progressing via a formula.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich has managed to build a career playing strong, heroic women.  The first film most people know her from is THE FIFTH ELEMENT, but she later went on to make THE MESSENGER (about Joan of Arc), also with Luc Besson at the helm (over the course of his career he has constantly made films featuring female action heroes).  She does a creditable job in all three as someone who manages to be heroic despite attempts at the Umbrella Corporation to manipulate her for their own purposes.<br /><br />This can be a fun movie if gone into with rather low expectations.  There is a low of gore, some pretty tense moments, but not a lot of plot.  As usual in these movies, greedy corporations are ultimately the enemy (something even truer in real life, yet why don't we remember that in real life?).  If taken for what it is -- slick fluff -- it can be enjoyable.  But if you start interrogating the plot and trying to make sense of it, you'll get frustrated quick.<br /><br />I first saw this several years ago.  At that time the only cast members I knew were Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez.  On this rescreening I was pleasantly surprised to see Eric Mabius in one of the main roles.  He is best known today as Daniel Meade on UGLY BETTY.  And while he doesn't quite make it into the sequel, his character sorta, kinda does.</p></body></html>

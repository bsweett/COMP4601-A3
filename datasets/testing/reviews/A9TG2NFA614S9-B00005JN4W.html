<meta name="summary" content="The SuperHeroes Go Into A Protection Program"></head><body><p>"The Incredibles" (2004) is a computer animated Pixar film in which a group of Superheroes have been sued and become a financial burden to the government. Before that Mr. Incredible and his girlfriend Elastigirl had a great old time fighting crime and evildoers. They and their super-ilk are exiled and put into a Superhero protection program. The government officer who sends Mr. Incredible into obscurity looks like ex-President Richard Nixon.<br />Later, after years of boring suburban life, Bob Carr, Mr. Incredible, is chafing to get back to work thwarting villains. He lives with his wife Elastigirl and three kids who also have superpowers that they have to keep hidden.<br />Bob is a very real and believable. He's a superhero with a lot of human flaws. He's a klutz, none too bright, overweight, and he's a henpecked husband; wife Elastigirl is a nag. It's ordinary family life: their kid, Dash, gets sent to the principal's office for misbehavior involving his super speed.<br />Bob serves as an insurance adjustor and has to put up with a nasty little boss. He's a husband who fears his boss and has a long-suffering wife. It's like an old-fashioned situation comedy where the father is a schlemiel Dagwood Bumstead type.<br />The office cubicle scenes are very well-done. Bob favors the customers and eventually gets fired. The scene where the diminutive fashion designer makes him a new costume is funny and clever. He is lured back into service as a superguy fighting for humanity to stop a menacing force that is out for world destruction.<br />When he was an active Superhero, Mr. Incredible had failed to encourage Buddy Pine, a Superhero-wannabe, who has now devolved into the evil super-villain mastermind Syndrone with superpowers of his own. He becomes Mr. Incredible's nemesis. Superheroes are being knocked off by Syndrone.<br />It congeals into a James Bondish film (remember this is all animated cartoon stuff), an action flick where good guys are fighting the superbad guys on an island. The action sequences may thrill the kiddies, but parents will have to stifle yawns. "Oh, this stuff again." The film is overly long, and the tedious action sequences aren't highly original.<br />The movie if full of satiric touches, but it's too drawn-out, and needs tighter editing.</p></body></html>

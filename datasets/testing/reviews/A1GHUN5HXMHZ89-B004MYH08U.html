<meta name="summary" content="Green Hornet"></head><body><p>Whomever thought that making the Green Hornet a comedy like the "Pink Panther" should be fired, kicked, horse whipped, flogged, drawn and quartered, rinse and repeat. Sure I found parts of the movie funny, but if you wanted a comedy call it something else and make it a non descript hero. Taking the good name of a serious crime fighter and making it into this mess just wasn't entertaining and only mildly funny. Kato would have been fine in a serious version, but the Hornet absolutely sucked and I'm not even a fan of the Green Hornet and I'm insulted. One can only hope they remake it like they did the Batmans and take it serious the second time around.<br /><br />CA Luster</p></body></html>

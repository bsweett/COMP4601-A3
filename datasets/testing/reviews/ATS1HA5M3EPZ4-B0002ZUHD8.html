Gone are the magic, the folklore and the love triangle infidelity that came with the fantasy tale of Excalibur.<br /><br />Now don't get too upset and think this is a disrespectful `re-imagining' like the Sean Connery/Richard Gere debacle of the mid 90s, First Knight.  Although that was a decent movie, it tore apart the fabric of what made the story great.  In this movie, Merlin is a soothsayer, a madman of sorts with a large following of nature worshipers.  You can see how this could kind of person could be seen as some sort of Wizard or magician.  If he says he caused the fog to roll in and all his people back him up, most people will believe it, and the legend will grow into a tale of fantasy.<br /><br />As with the love triangle with Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot; in this film it's done as a side note.  No wedding, no infidelity, no romance.  Just an obvious attraction between her and the two knights, obviously finding each of them appealing for different reasons.  The battles are intense and realistic, the cinematography and visuals of the landscapes are spectacular.  And the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is pounding and alive, probably one of the best he's done in years.<br /><br />The performances by the three lead actors is solid.  Great interactions with Arthur and Guinevere, proving once again that Clive Owen is highly underrated and Keira Knightly is one of the most talented young actresses of the day.  Ian Groffold does a fine job as well displaying a personality in Lancelot we have never really seen.  It's a shame this movie didn't do better at the box office, but if it find life in DVD and rental, I will be happy that it got it recognition.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="awesome movie"></head><body><p>Great acting, good filming, and compelling storyline made for a truly memorable movie about two men bound together by fate. One suffers from osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle-bone disorder) while the other one seems really lucky as he is able to avoid serious injury and death. Why? Well, watch this movie and you'll see... it really is an awesome film, and Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson do great job in their respective roles. This is also one of M. Night Shymalan's better - if not best - films.</p></body></html>

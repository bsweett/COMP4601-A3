<meta name="summary" content="For Incredible Fun, Get This Movie"></head><body><p>The world used to rely on superheroes to protect us.  But when their powers started hurting people, they were forced to go into hiding and only be known by their secret identity.<br /><br />Fast-forward 15 years, and you get the Parr family.  Bob (Mr. Incredible) is a claims agent at an insurance company.  Helen (Elastigirl) has really taken to the roll of full-time wife and mother.  And they have three kids.  Violet is a teenage girl who can turn invisible and create force fields.  Son Dashiell can move extremely fast.  Then there's baby Jack-Jack.  He might just turn out to be the only normal one of the family.<br /><br />One day, Bob gets a secret message about an island that needs his help.  Since he hasn't adjusted at all to living a normal life, he secretly heads out.  What he doesn't know is that it's a trap.  Now the entire family will have to come together to survive this crisis.<br /><br />This movie works on a couple different levels.  There's the action, of course.  The main storyline moves quickly and entertains in spades.  Then there's the other stuff.  The people at Pixar did a good job of creating normal family situations for their super hero characters.  Violet and her powers especially are the perfect match.  And the scene with the parents arguing over how to get to the villain's machine while traveling at super speeds down the freeway is hysterical.<br /><br />And that's the great thing about this movie.  It moves with ease from family drama to action to comedy without missing a beat.  Because of the super hero storyline, small kids won't enjoy it as much as previous Pixar offerings.  But the rest of the family will find it highly entertaining.<br /><br />Once again, Pixar shows that it knows how to do DVD right.  Disc one of this two-disc set contains the movie in widescreen with full surround sound.  Transferring directly from the digital source, it looks and sounds great.  There are two great commentaries for this movie, one with director Brad Bird and Producer John Walker - the other with several key animators.  Disc two features behind the scenes documentaries, deleted scenes, and a couple of shorts.  "Boundin'" played in the theater before the movie.  "Jack-Jack Attack" is all new, and features the story of what Jack-Jack was up to that created all those frantic phone messages we heard near the end of the movie.  There is a brief segment called "Incredi-Blunders," but don't be deceived.  It's mistakes in rendering and not bloopers like Pixar used to do.  (BTW, anyone besides me miss them?)<br /><br />This film is great fun and extremely deserving of its recent Oscar win.  Pixar has another winner on its hands.  I hope their winning streak continues for quite some time to come.</p></body></html>

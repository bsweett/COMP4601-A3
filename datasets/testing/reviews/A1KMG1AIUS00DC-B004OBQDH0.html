<meta name="summary" content="A lumbering, penultimate episode"></head><body><p>"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I" is being released on Blu-ray in plenty of time to capitalize on the final installment of the saga, due in theatres this July.  Warner Brothers decided to divide the last book of the series into two motion pictures to incorporate as much plot and as many characters from the novel as possible.<br /><br />Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is the primary obstacle to the total control by Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) of both the wizard and human worlds.  Voldemort has sent an army of Death Eaters to find the young wizard.  Accompanied by Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint), Harry embarks on a journey that finds him crossing paths with many of the characters he's previously encountered at Hogwarts.<br /><br />Director David Yates handles the action sequences effectively. The film starts with a terrific chase in which Alastor Moody (Brendan Gleeson) turns many of Harry's closest friends into Potter clones to confuse the Death Eaters.  Another standout sequence is Harry and friends' infiltration of the Ministry of Magic.  Unfortunately, the film's pacing is sluggish and bogs down the proceedings considerably.<br /><br />This installment is far different in tone from the first.  It is darker and downbeat, plodding and repetitious.  The special effects, as usual in a Potter film, are very good, but the magic isn't there.  Back are familiar characters Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter), Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), and Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane).<br /><br />The three-disc Combo Pack edition contains Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital Copy versions of the movie.  The main extra is the opening scene of "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part II."  There are also additional scenes and several behind-the-scenes featurettes.  The movie is also available in single-disc Blu-ray and DVD editions.</p></body></html>

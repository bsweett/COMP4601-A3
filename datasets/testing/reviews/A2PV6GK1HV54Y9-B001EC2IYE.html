Hilary Swank is not that good of an actress, I find her unbearable to watch. Morgan Freeman always seems to play the same character but to my surprise Clint Eastwood is quite good in this film, his acting has never been better. The story and pace of the film is what leaves me disappointed. I just couldn't get into this weeper, oh well.</p></body></html>

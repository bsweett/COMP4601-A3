<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly sweet"></head><body><p>It starts as one of those everyday dramas, a teenage girl finds herself pregnant. Her first thought is to end the pregnancy but, when the time comes, she shies and bolts from the clinic for no rational reason. Instead, she decides to bring the baby to term and find a good home for it.<br /><br />Even when she's as big as "a planet" (and equally inhabited), Juno keeps her sassy attitude and sarcastic humor. Her character, played wonderfully well by Ellen Page, carries the movie with her one-liners and attitude. Like the other characters, Juno comes across as complex and believable, fragile and resilient at the same time. Her social world seems true too, almost a closed society of teenagers with incidental and often uncomfortable interactions with the adults.<br /><br />This might be the most improbable feel-good movie ever. In fact that would be the one criticism I'd offer, that it seems a bit more "cleaned up" than I'd expect many lives to be. The teenagers are goofy, gawky, and uncertain, but never show the vicious edge that comes out way too frequently. Her whole world is largely supportive, or at least benign. I don't wish a pregnancy on any teenager, but I'd wish that kind of support for any who do end up as mommy-to-be, the kind of support that too few girls in trouble seem to get. That happy background keeps makes the comedy possible, and the edgy humor makes this movie succeed.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The best of the Toy Story Trilogy but NOT for small children"></head><body><p>Okay, so there are well over 150 reviews of the film posted already, so I don't need to go into details of the plot again. I was probably one of the few who did not see the film when it was released in theaters and so the DVD (not the Blu-ray) was my first chance to see it.<br /><br />While the name Disney is synonymous with  "Kid's movie", this one - like Up really hits the mark with adults - especially "baby boomers". Why? For a few reasons:<br /><br />1. The toys themselves are "baby boomer" icons: Mr. (and Mrs.) Potato Head, Slinky, Barbie and Ken and the very sly - and somewhat crude - reference to Lincoln Logs)<br /><br />2. There are way too many scary scenes - the final incinerator one, most of all - that look too realistic and will certainly scare children under 6 or 7.<br /><br />3. The script is written so to not bore the older viewers, but there are sections which little ones will find boring. And the viewer has to really understand the relationship of Barbie and Ken to get the many scenes they have. (And they are fun!)<br /><br />4. The Pixar detail is so wonderful and detailed - again the detail in the incinerator belt - that adults will be more impressed than children.<br /><br />5. Finally it'll be the adults who will relate to Andy having to leave his "pals" and will shed a tear at the end. (I certainly did).<br /><br />The bonus features on the DVD will also appeal to adults more than kids. The making of film, the short Pixar films and the brief "Buzz Lightyear" short made for NASA will be lost on any kids under 10.<br /><br />So, I'm here to rave about the film and encourage adults to buy this for themselves - even if they don't have children. Many of us grew up with these toys and they were our "friends". There's some nostalgia here as well as a great script, superb graphics (I watched on a standard def TV and it was still very sharp) and even some REALLY thrilling moments. Like Up, this will certainly make my Top Ten list this year!<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />"Anything Phonographic"</p></body></html>

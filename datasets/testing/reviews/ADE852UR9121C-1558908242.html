Now, he makes movies that challenges the norm in Hollywood and hangs out with fellow "kick-a$$" director Robert Rodriguez. And of all his movies, I like Pulp Fiction the best. Yeah, his other work were also cool/stylistic/bad-a$$ (pick a word, they're all suitable) but this movie really blew me away with its unique storytelling, superb performances and witty dialogue.<br /><br />It's hard to explain the story, because it moves in and out of specific events, each interweaving with the next, either before or after the previous event. Confused? Watch it and you'll understand. But ultimately, it is a story about situations with various people, each interesting as hell. We have two hit men, a boxer and his girlfriend, the mob boss, his wife, two petty robbers and let's see...yeah, a guy who smart talks his way to cleaning messes (e.g. dead bodies). It may sound unusual but it all adds up to make a surprisingly entertaining movie.<br /><br />As I said, there are many things I loved about this movie, but something that really stands out is the screenplay. At the time, it was considered to be new and refreshing, and I can see why. Watching the movie more than 10 times, I realize something...this movie is not important, it probably does not depict real life and it's even incredibly crazy at times. It is also never going to affect me in any way. Well, what makes it special? I would call this cinematic escapism at it's finest. Many times, we find that the characters talk about totally different things than what we expect. But instead of sounding lame, Tarantino has a gift of knowing how far he should take it, and it ends up sounding cool and extremely unique. Tell me, how many people can pull of talking about burgers in Amsterdam sound cool and intelligent...and as insane as that sounds, Tarantino does it. The thing you notice immediately is the passion involved in the movie. You know you're getting whatever the f*ck Tarantino wishes to put into it, without pesky studio bosses, or marketing executives telling him otherwise. It's a huge gamble, but it works.<br /><br />A good script is integral, but what really sells the movie is the actors...and the fact that Tarantino got a whole bunch of talented people to appear in Pulp Fiction, speaks for itself. John Travolta delivers one of his best performances, launching back his career to an all-time high. Samuel L. Jackson is also superb in his role. The rest of the cast; Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel...all give very convincing performances that the movie comes alive and I guess making it so much more than what it set out to be.<br /><br />Finally, if you look at Top 100 Lists anywhere, on the net, in cinema books...you are bound to find this movie somewhere there, and believe me... it very well deserves to be. Considered historic in American cinema, I for one, recommend it wholeheartedly.</p></body></html>

If any of the incidents depicted were to happen in real life the first thing people would say was "It all happened so fast..."<br /><br />Matt Damon is perfect for this because he's not cute enough to be a distraction.  Imagine Ben Affleck crashing a car and then dissapearing into a crowd in Moscow.<br /><br />Although the plot is 100% predictable the movie is fun and my 20 minute test came and went (this is when I check my watch).<br /><br />So enjoy.  And let me also reccomend the somewhat less sophisticated The Transporter.  If you're looking for Sophie's Choice, neither of these will appeal to you but but trust me, both pass the 20 minute test easily.</p></body></html>

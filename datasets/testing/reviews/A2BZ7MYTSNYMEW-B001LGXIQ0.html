<meta name="summary" content="Extremely entertaining!"></head><body><p>Tired of just dealing with paperwork, analyzing intelligence information and being behind the scenes, Analyst Maxwell Smart wants nothing more than to become a Special Agent. And the "Chief" gives him his opportunity when Kaos starts systematically killing Control agents, revealing their identities placing them in danger all over the world. Newly promoted Special Agent 86 (Maxwell Smart), along with his capable partner, the very pretty "Agent 99" (Anna Hathaway) and his trusted and very sexy friend "Agent 23" (Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson) set out to save the world. Faced with danger and adventure, Smart proves that he is more than an analyst, but a secret agent to be reckoned with.<br /><br />This movie was extremely entertaining and funny. There were scenes that simply made me laugh out loud (the laser room, skydiving, throwing up in the face piece, or even "The Rock" running into a wall), and Steve Carell made a wonderful Maxwell Smart. And I even think that "The Rock" has a future in comedy. He is showing that he is a well rounded actor. Comedy, romance, drama and action adventure. With all that being said, I enjoyed this movie and think you will too.</p></body></html>

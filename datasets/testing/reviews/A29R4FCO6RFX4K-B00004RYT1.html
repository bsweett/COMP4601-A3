<meta name="summary" content="The "Mother" of all horror films"></head><body><p>An undisputed classic, PSYCHO is the mother of all horror films. Released in 1960, the master's most macarbe film was seen by audiences as tasteless and vulgar, now, 42 years later, it's seen as one of the great lessons in suspense. As Hitchcock himself once put it, "The trick is to pull the rug out from people's feet". Indeed, in what other film before or after do we see the supposed leading lady get killed 20 minutes through? Throughout the film, themes of fear, paranoia and horror are all displayed to maximum effect. Benard Herrman's terrific score is perhaps one of the most memorable film scores ever composed. Imitated to death, the notorious "shower scene" with sharp violin strings and high percussion culminates in one of the most amazing sequences ever put onto film. Other nice touches include the introduction of "mother", Arbogast's demise, and a hinting to Hitchcock's next film, THE BIRDS. Forget the sequels and Gus Van Sant's dismal remake. PSYCHO is one of the greats.</p></body></html>

He uses this ability in a low budget magic act in Vegas. To support himself he gambles at the casinos, but not enough to alert the security. One night unfortunately he does attract their attention. His ability to anticipate security's every move allows him to escape and gains the attention of the FBI. The FBI is searching for a missing nuclear weapon and want Cage to help. Cage is more interested in meeting the woman who he had a vision of. She is the only vision he's ever had that's more than 2 minutes into the future. He uses his weird ability to charm her and keep ahead of the FBI. The people who stole the bomb are also after Cage to kill him.<br /><br />I think someone had the idea of a guy who had a limited ability to tell the future but obviously didn't know where to go with the premise. This story doesn't work. The love story between Cage and Biel is dull and unbelievable and to top it all, no explanation is given for why he saw her so far in advance. The bomb story line is just poorly thought out. The bad guys are indistinct and uninteresting and no reason is given for why or how they stole the nuke. The ending is stupid and left me asking, "Is that it?" Next has an intrigueing premise but they had no idea what to do with it.</p></body></html>

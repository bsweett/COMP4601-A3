<meta name="summary" content="Dang.  Makes The Wild and Over the Hedge look like"></head><body><p>well, ARG!  Kids movies.  I mean, Cars actually seemed like a full blown movie, while the aforementioned movies were held together by a paper thin plot.  Over the Hedge was a good 4 star movie, while The Wild was more like 3 star, but I'm getting off track.<br /><br />Cars is the newest Pixar movie, and the only animated movies I'll be willing to see in theater is a Pixar, Aardman, OR Shrek movie.  I didn't see Cars in theatres because I heard it wasn't as good as the other Pixar movies and not as funny.  MAN I h*te critics sometimes.  This is a very good movie and should win Best Animated movie for the Oscars.  IT was better than A Bug's Life and as good as Monsters Inc.  While I think Finding Nemo and The Incredibles were better this is definately a great movie.<br /><br />The movie is all about appreciating the little things in life and slowing down.  Its not really funny, its more like a heartfelt, old fashioned movie.  The direction is great, Voice work is great, and to all those people who say it was too long I say, "You have ADD, get some Meds."</p></body></html>

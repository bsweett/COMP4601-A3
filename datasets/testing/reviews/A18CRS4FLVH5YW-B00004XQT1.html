Namely with the fact Christian Bale conveys such a visciousness that if you were ever to encounter him in person you would never look at rich, wealthy, yuppie types the same way  again.  The thing that makes this film so much fun to watch is the fusion  of 80's nostalgia and raw carnage being displayed with such creativity.  I  imagine the forthcoming DVD will have deleted scenes that weren't used in  the initial film making the experience even more surreal.  What is so  impressive is how the director makes the mood so pasty and drab looking.  Every scene has this dark sensibility but most of the time you are  presented with daytime overcast skies, white walls and classic 80's  artwork. The sets make Batemans character seem so friendly but so  incredibly frightening too.  You leave the film thinking about all the  people you know in your life that could possibly have similar defects.  This film is definately a winner and sure to be the Christian Bale breakout  performance people will remember him for.</p></body></html>

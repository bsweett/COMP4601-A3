<meta name="summary" content="ONE GLORIOUS SUSPENSE THRILLER THAT EVEN HITCHCOCK  WOULD ADMIRE"></head><body><p>Screenwriter-director Quentin Tarantino (Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs) is a somewhat disturbing person, as are his films, which tend toward what I would call "black drama" - in the same way that the films of the Coen brothers tend toward black comedy. But Tarantino's films are incredibly interesting both visually and for their stories, which, like the Coens' films, are filled with some very interesting characters. In this case, the Inglourious Basterds is a group of fictional American soldiers, led by Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), that is terrorizing the Nazis in France during WWII by brutally killing and scalping them Indian style. (This is not a film for weak stomachs.) If the group does let one go, they carve a swastika in his forehead so everyone will know, after the war, what he was.<br /><br />Inglourious Basterds is so well done, and so interesting, that I think it's permissible to overlook Tarantino's excesses for the moment in order to appreciate his craftsmanship. Young directors could learn much from him about how to create riveting scenes, characters and even set pieces. Tarantino likes to create vignettes, which means that each scene can stand on its own, even though, together, they tell a compelling story. His vision seems to come from comic books and graphic novels rather than reality. The art direction and photography are so graphic and so saturated with color that they add to the intensity of the action.<br /><br />Some of the more vulnerable characters are memorable - like Perrier LaPadite, a French dairy farmer, played by Denis Menochet, who pretty much steals one of the early scenes with his understated but poignant performance. The German Colonel Hans Landa - known as "the Hunter" because of his ability to track down Jews, and portrayed superbly by Christoph Waltz - fenagles LaPadite into disclosing that a family of Jews is hiding beneath his house. Or Shosanna, the only member of that family that escapes annihilation by Waltz's men. She flees to Paris and becomes the owner of a cinema that figures prominently in the story. She is played wonderfully by Melanie Laurent.<br /><br />Daniel Bruhl is effective as Fredrick Zoller, a German officer that becomes infatuated with Shosanna. Besides Colonel Hans Landa, most of the Nazis are little more than caricatures, except for Bridget von Hammersmark, a German actress-turned-spy, played by Diane Kruger, who dominates the best scene in the film - a meeting in a rathskeller that turns into a Mexican standoff and will have you on the edge of your seat. As a matter of fact, most of the movie will. Except for the overly graphic violence and the brutality of certain scenes, Inglourious Basterds is a glorious suspense thriller that even Alfred Hitchcock would admire. Rated R for strong graphic violence, language and brief sexuality.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></body></html>

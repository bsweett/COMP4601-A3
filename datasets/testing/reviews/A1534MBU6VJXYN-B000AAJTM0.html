At a time when movies weere starting to become formulaic and unoriginal, Tarrentino all of a sudden burst on the scene with 1992's "Resevoir Dogs", a sprawling, intensely violent crime drama that was the most groundbreaking and original movie to come out in years. Next came "True Romance". Though Tony Scott directed it, the film would not have worked without Tarrentino's excellent screenplay, which featured some of the best dialogue ever commited to film in addition to some bitingly funny humor and nonstop action. Those first two films were excellent, but nothing could prepare Hollywood for tarretino's next film. "Pulp Fiction" was indeed a unique movie: rather than have a plot revolving a central character or characters, "Pulp Fiction" was four films in one. In addition, Tarrentino loaded the cast with A-listers that normally wouldn't take a role in one of Tarrentino's independent based films, then again, when you have a project like this thrown in your face, how could you refuse?<br /><br />Well, "Pulp Fiction" turned out to be a smash with both critics and audiences around the world. First, it won the Palm d'or (a foreign film award) as best pciture, than it won over critics around the world with its unique storytelling and excellent cast. Finally, the $ 8 million movie grossed over $ 100 million at the box office, got Tarrentino an Oscart for best screenplay, and rescued the careers of former Hollywood heavyweights John Travolta (who received an Oscar nomination) and Bruce Willis (whou should have received an Oscar nomination).<br /><br />"Pulp Fiction", as I said earlier, is essentially four films in one. One deals with two hitmen, Vincent Vega (Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson, who chews the scenery like a steak every chance he gets). Vincent and Jules make small talk about religion, animals and McDonald's in Paris and Amsterdam. Meanwhile, down on his luck boxer Butch Coolidge (Willis) has been ordered by crime boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) to throw a fight while Vega take his wife Mia (Uma Thurman) on a date, which leads to a dance-off and disaster. Next thing you know, Coolidge wins the fight, kills Vega, and him and Marcellus are held hostage in a weapons shop (the best scene in the film). The last sequence involves Winston Wolf (Harvey Keitel) helping Jules and Vega (in case you're wondering, this film is not in chronological order) disposing of a body with the help of Jimmy (Tarrentino himself). To cap things off is a showdown at a local dinner between Jules and Vincent and two crime loving lovers (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer).<br /><br />A little confusing, hah? Well, if the plot is a little too much to handle, than you should just watch it for the wonderful cast assembled for it. Some members (Travolta, Willis, Jackson, Thurman, Rhames) are focal points who dominate the film, while others (Christopher Walken, Rosanna Arquette, Eric Stoltz, Plummer, Roth, Keitel, Maria De Medeiros) hardly appear at all. The point is, when they're onscreen, they command it. If this film had thrown Nicholson, Pacino and De Niro into the mix, than I'd consider it the rgeatest cast of actors assembled for any film. If "Pulp Fiction" had nothing else going for it, the cast would still shine through with their wondeful performances.<br /><br />However, "Pulp Fiction" has a lot going for it. It is perfect. And this special edition two disc dvd just adds to that perfrction. The extras are outstanding. One of the best se's ever. However, even if this film had no extras, it would still be worth it for the film alone.</p></body></html>

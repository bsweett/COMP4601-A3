<meta name="summary" content="nicely done HD-DVD"></head><body><p>All right, so this HD-DVD is not home theater demo material.  It still easily surpasses the standard edition upon side by side comparisons.  Yes, there are still some scenes that look like standard DVD, but for the most part, you can see Harrison's beard more clearly as well as many other details.  Perhaps this is a testament to the movie itself...the story is so good you don't simply sit there and marvel at the clarity!  Until another edition comes along to best this latest one ( and you know one will), then this is the one to buy!</p></body></html>

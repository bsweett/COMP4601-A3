His talents behind the camera were first evident, and impressive, in Play Misty for Me (1971). Unforgiven received an Academy Award for best film, as did Eastwood for directing it. So many memorable characters which include Bill Munny (Eastwood), Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman), Sheriff "Little Bill" Daggett (Gene Hackman), and English Bob (Richard Harris). What I find most interesting is Eastwood's willingness and ability to portray an old widow, far past his prime, who reluctantly agrees to accept an assignment to earn some much-needed money for himself and his family. Munny (obviously, no pun intended)  enlists the aid of his friend Logan. They are joined by the self-described "Schofield Kid" (Jaimz Woolvett) and proceed to a town under the absolute control of Daggett who, unlike Brian Dennehy's character Cobb in Silverado, can be personally quite appealing but is nonetheless every bit as formidable. (I shall never forget Daggett's dying words, "But I'm building a house!") In my opinion, the plot really is not especially important. The film's greatest strengths are found within the meticulous development of various characters, a process under Eastwood's sure direction which is gradual and both subtle and substantial. Perhaps the character of journalist W.W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek) is necessary to expedite the exposition but he seems to add little else. However, all others among the supporting cast are essential.<p>Unforgiven can be categorized as a "western" but, in my opinion, it transcends that genre as it examines how the reality of an old man's vengeance is far more significant than the myth associated with his earlier adventures. Near the end of the film, "Little Bill" must deal with a Munny who is, not with someone who once was. The fact that Munny prevails reveals much about him...and perhaps about Eastwood and others who in later life, like Tennyson's Ulysses, "strive to seek, to find...and not to yield."</p></body></html>

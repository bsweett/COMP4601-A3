It has hilarious dialogue, lovely visual gags, and social satire (that's obviously found in the original "Frankenstein"). But this is funny social satire! Gene Wilder is brilliant as the young Frankenstein (pronounced Frahn-ken-shteen), while the late Marty Feldman is a laugh riot as Igor (pronounced Eye-Gore). Teri Garr is attractive as Inga ("Roll in ze hay!"), while the late Peter Boyle is fantastic as the Frahn-ken-shteen's latest creation.

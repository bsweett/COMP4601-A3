<meta name="summary" content="Tia and Cloris Steal Film"></head><body><p>This is a sweet film, not exactly realistic; everyone seems to be a little too much on type.  Now I did not say everyone was stereotyped, just actors playing a type.  Cloris Leachman is the drunken mother ignored by her striving, seemingly perfect daughter, Tea Leoni.  Adam Sandler plays, er Adam Sandler, a successful, quirky, restrained Jewish guy.  Paz Vega is smart, wise, Mexican, immigrant, and poor housekeeper to Sandler's two kids and cloying, controlling wife.  Flour has a daughter out of wedlock (How did that happen to such a wise woman?)and then takes the unhappy rich family under her wings as much as the language barrier will bear.  That is it.  Sandler is unhappy with narcissistic Leoni and well he should be.  He pouts and grovels.  Gradually he comes to appreciate Vega as the counterpoint to his neurotic wife.<br /><br />I commend Sandler's attempt to move on from his dopey caricature, his screwball, gross-out roles.  I am thinking of the underrated, Punch Drunk Love, when I say he's going adult in comedy or drama situations.  Keep trying Adam.  Someday you will be real.</p></body></html>

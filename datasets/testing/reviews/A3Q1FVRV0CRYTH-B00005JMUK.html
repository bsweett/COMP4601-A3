As I watched the account of this woman's life I was in constant agony for I felt for her and her situation, her horrific lot in life.  Aileen Wuornos (Charlize Theron) is not the monster here.  The monster is the life she led, the life forced upon her, the life that ate at her everyday.  Aileen, prostitute since thirteen, never knew anything more than what she had, and as the film opens we see that she is about to take her own life because of this, that was until she meets Selby Wall (Christina Ricci).  Selby (real name was Tyria Moore) is a closet lesbian who wants to come out against the will of her overbearing parents.  She meets Aileen in a gay bar, a place apparently Aileen was unaware was a gay bar, but after they meet they lose something they've felt their whole life...they no longer feel lonely, alone.<br /><br />In order to keep Selby by her side Aileen turns back to prostitution but after being abused horrifically by a 'John' Aileen makes a change.  That's when the murders begin, and even though some are not justified and some are heartbreaking (especially when she murders and innocent man out of pure fear and hopelessness) you never feel as though she deserves what she gets.  She didn't deserve the hand she was dealt and its heart wrenching to see her have to go through everything she went through.  Yes, it's true that not all women who are raped by their father figure turn out to be murderers, but I don't feel that's the reason she killed.  There is so much we don't know about the woman that was Aileen Wuornos, but from Charlize's brilliant performance we gather that she was afraid, she was alone, she was confused and she was emotionally dieing if not already dead.  She had been abused in everyway possible and thrown out without a chance, without a care in the world, even by the ones she loved the most (most notably Selby).<br /><br />This is a truly heartbreaking and, yes, painful film to watch but it's one that we all do well to experience to know the tragedy we ourselves are at times too guarded (and judgmental) against.</p></body></html>

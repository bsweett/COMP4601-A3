<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Special Edition"></head><body><p>This 2-disc Special Edition DVD has some of the best features that I have ever seen on a DVD. This is most fitting given the fact that this is one of the very best Science Fiction movies that I have ever seen. The performances are excellent as are the direction and script. You can tell that the producers of both the movie and the Special Edition really dedicated themselves to their tasks.  This is important because there are so many 2 disc "special edition" DVD's out there that when you really get right down to it, just are not all that special.</p></body></html>

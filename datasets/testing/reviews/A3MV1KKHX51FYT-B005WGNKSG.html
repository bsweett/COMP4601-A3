It has many repulsive characters and some X-rated scenes. This story echoes "The Big Sleep", "Chinatown", and "Roseanna". It starts with a libel suit then turns into a murder mystery (like many of the "Perry Mason" novels). Can you believe a serial killer living in an isolated location? Most serial killers seek areas with a large transient population. It does warn you about the Internet and how it was designed to allow governmental agencies and others to hack into your computer. Is there a political agenda via the characters in this story?<br /><br />An old man receives a package from Hong Kong. What does it mean? Mikael Blomkvist is convicted of libel for claiming millionaire Wennerstr&ouml;m was guilty of gun-running and other crimes. [Would an experienced journalist make this mistake?] Micke will pay a 150,000 kroner fine and go to jail for his malicious report. Who is taking photos of Micke? Researcher Salander says Blomkvist was set up with forged documents. [The danger of a sole source.] Dirch Frode calls Micke with a job for client Henrik Vanger (of the Vanger group of companies). Vanger lives on the island of Hederby; a long bridge connects it to the city of Hederstad. Vanger's niece Harriet disappeared in 1965. She was Micke's babysitter then! "She just disappeared." Murdered?<br /><br />The computer researcher has a new probation officer; he asks questions about her finances, her piercings, and her sex life. Is she obstinate? After Harriet disappeared Henrik Vanger continued to receive a framed flower every year. He wants to know the truth. [Does he have suspicions?] Salander taps into Micke's laptop to spy on him. We see life in a Swedish subway. [Where is Paul Kersey?] Micke does research into the Vanger family history. What can he find out after forty years? What do those 5-digit telephone numbers mean? He looks at old negatives from the local newspaper. Will he find a clue? [Like "Blowup"?] He learns how he was set up with forged documents. [No other research?]<br /><br />Salander asks for 20,000 kroner for a new laptop. Her probation officer insists she be nice to him. [An expose of a corrupt probation system?] Micke notices an overlooked clue in those old photos. Who is the man in a blue sweater? Why has "Wasp" hacked into his computer? What is in the Book of Leviticus? Micke asks Lisbeth for help. They look into an earlier killing. "Are you okay?" [Is there symbolism in the cigarette smoking?] Liv was murdered in 1949, before Harriet was born. [Note the manufacturer of that hired car.] Are they under surveillance? [Ketchup on eggs?] Is that amber necklace a clue? Who shot at Micke? Was it a "hunting accident"? They learn the identity of "BJ". Is there a common pattern?<br /><br />Salander looks up old records and finds a name. Micke learns the shocking truth! "You can't leave any witnesses." [Can you believe this revolting discovery?] Will help arrive in time? [Of course.] Will there be poetic justice in a car crash? [Like "Boomerang"?] Will Salander shed light on her past? Will the crimes of a serial killer be exposed? "He's not coming back." "We don't know anything." "You choose who you want to be." [More irony?] Micke visits Australia, Salander visits her mother. There is a reunion and an exposure of family secrets. Salander brings reading material to imprisoned Micke. Will this expose gun-running and drug trafficking for a happy ending? [The book "Compromised" did the same.] Who was the blond woman who embezzled millions from a Cayman Islands bank?<br /><br />Overall, does this story have redeeming social values? Parts of this story seem implausible. It is an average story hyped with some repulsive scenes. A journalist convicted of libel provides "plausible denial" for his employer. Lisbeth provides added complications and contrast. [Was the reporter made up to resemble Stieg Larsson?] Where was `Martin Beck' when we needed him?</p></body></html>

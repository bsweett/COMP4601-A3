Also a great action star line-up with Jesse Ventura and Carl Weathers.<br /><br /> The characters seem like GI-Joe action figure stereotypes but the script and action sequences make them believable and entertaining. Even with the mystery of the predator being gone, I still get thrills every time I see this movie: not to mention laughs at the humorous dialogue; &quot;I'm gonna have me some fun! I'm gonna have me some fun!&quot;<br /><br /> The special effects are still great after all of this time and the music really carries on the suspense. Altogether one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made! I've watched this movie a hundred times and I stil enjoy it.</p></body></html>

Carpenter's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009UW0N">Halloween</a> was made on a shoe-string budget of $325,000 ($1,111,914 today) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AM6OQ2">The Fog</a> was granted only one-million ($2,677,633 today). That's not much for a film. And Carpenter crafted a work which has scarred horror-enthusiasts for life ... who among us can drive into a fog-bank and not think, "Here's where the hook smashes through my windshield."<br /><br />Wainwright was given a staggering $18,0000 to shoot this remake ... but where did it go? On television-star Tom Welling? Or television-star Maggie Grace? Or television-star Sara Botsford? No, that can't be right ... they are TELEVISION stars! And, how that small-screen quasi-talent translates to the big-screen ... as quasi-talent. And, am I the only one who noticed that many of Wainwright's actors appeared in "Smallville" ... way to reach!<br /><br />As far the writing is concerned, I do not want to have any more back-story in my remakes (actually, I DO NOT WANT any more remakes). I do not care that Leatherface had a debilitating  skin-condition (thanks for that Marcus Nispel), and I don't care that Michael Myers had a tormented childhood (thanks for that Rob Zombie) and really don't care about this long, protracted expansion of the leper-story. Who cares?! In fact, as Hooper and Carpenter know ... the less back-story the audience receives, the more frightening the film! With a scant back-story, we are only left to wonder how these things happen ... could they happen to us? Spell-out the mystery and lose the terror. Pretty simple, right?<br /><br />Selma Blair brought some life to her role of Stevie (formerly played by Barbeau). But, as written, her part was nonsensical ... why situate her in the role of a DJ only to rip her out of the light-house and have her help no one. The original story was so gripping because of Stevie's efforts to guide the town-residents to non fog-infested areas. We cheered for her ... and she was The Final Girl (see Carol Clover - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691006202">Men, Women, and Chain Saws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film</a>). She was helpful, strong, and resilient. This Stevie ... well, she's just a Mom who paints her toenails. Even Blair's sizable talent could not rescue the writing.<br /><br />Lastly, the conclusion. It was breathtaking ... breathtakingly bad. My companion and I literally gasped and shouted, "WHAT??!" If you must watch this work, be prepared for a radical change ... a nonsensical, horrendous change that you cannot even guess.<br /><br />Bottomline: this is a train-wreck you will want to avoid ... buy the 1980 original and enjoy!</p></body></html>

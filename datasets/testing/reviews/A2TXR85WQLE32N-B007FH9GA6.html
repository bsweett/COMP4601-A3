<meta name="summary" content="Exquisite but Disturbing..."></head><body><p>The 2011 American version of "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is an exquisitely crafted, hard-hitting movie, based on the best-selling Swedish novel.  On the surface, it is a cold case murder mystery, resurrected by a dying man and a disgraced journalist.  It is much more than that, a tense and often terrifying voyage into human darkness that may stay with the viewer for awhile.<br /><br />"Tattoo" offers superb location shooting in Stockholm and on a Swedish island, with the winter darkness seemingly pursuing the characters indoors.  The excellent casting features Daniel Craig as investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist, Christopher Plummer as the dying industrialist who wants to learn the fate of a long-missing niece, and Skellan Skarsgard as the nephew who encourages both men, for his own reasons.  However, the movie is stolen by Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander, an abused and twisted but supremely effective computer hacker and investigator who assists Blomkvist.<br /><br />At 158 minutes, this is a long movie, yet the pacing and dialogue maintain the tension throughout.  The story tracks the separate and rather unhappy lives of Blomkvist and Salander until they intersect in the pursuit of the missing girl and her presumed murderer.  Following a thin, 40 year-old trail of clues, Mikael and Lisbeth form a touching and almost haunting alliance.  This reviewer had not read the novel and so was not prepared for the terrifying solution to the mystery of the missing girl, or the movie's multiple endings.<br /><br />"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is very highly recommended as a well-done movie with impact.  It is for adults only, not least for the disturbing violence visited on Lisbeth early in the movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""I want you to be as big as Sinatra""></head><body><p>About five minutes into Beyond the Sea, Steve Blauner (John Goodman) turns to Bobby Darin (Kevin Spacey) and cracks a joke about never being to old to play the 50's crooner. Kevin laughs and responds by saying that you are probably right. This is supposed to be the in-joke of the film, the comical irony and that Kevin's age doesn't really matter.<br /><br />Well, the problem is that it does matter, because no matter how much the viewer has to suspend belief, and no matter how good Spacey actually is in the role, at 45, Mr. Spacey is far too old to play Bobby Daren. In reality, he looks kind of creepy and weird - maybe it's the penciled-in eyebrows and the black, artificially lacquered hair.<br /><br />Yet the star does manage to capture Daren's desperation, his braggadocio, and yes, his magnetism. As a dancer, the actor isn't very limber and he often looks rather silly, but his vocal impersonation of Darin in unsurpassed, and you really have to hand it to Spacey for taking on a difficult role and managing, to mostly, pull it off.<br /><br />Darin, plagued by a weak heart from rheumatic fever, was racing against time to become "as big as Sinatra." As a rock 'n' roller, whose first hit, "Splish Splash" made him a teen idol in 1958, he played a desperate game of catch-up; it was as though he new that his days were numbered. His often-tumultuous personal life, his marriage to Sandra Dee (Kate Bosworth), and his professional efforts to become the world's most famous crooner, was a testament to his ferocious willpower.<br /><br />The movie picks out the important events in his life - his fledging career, his marriage, his anti-Vietnam War stance, and the revelation that he was adopted, and his eventual return to performing in Las Vegas where he was constantly plagued by declining health. By far the strongest moments are the scenes of his dogged pursuit and tempestuous marriage to Sandra Dee.<br /><br />Both were egoists, driven by relentless ambition, and Kate Bosworth does a good job of playing Dee as a type of chirpy, fatuous caricature, the product of her controlling mother's unremitting desires. This is a movie that touches on the ugly reality of show-business mothers who force their children to act out their dreams, while also lining their own pocketbooks.<br /><br />Beyond the Sea sort of succeeds because it has a heartfelt earnestness and sincerity, and getting the movie made was obviously a labor of love for the talented Mr. Spacey. But the movie is sometimes messy, disjointed and self-indulgent; it's also meandering and convoluted, often resorting to cornball conventions such as dramatic scenes suddenly dissolving into out-of-place production numbers.<br /><br />The most noticeable flaw, however, is the opening conceit - Spacey making a movie about Darin making a movie about Darin - to the omnipresent, cocky Little Bobby (William Ullrich). This doesn't quite work and comes across as out of place; it's even worse when these fantasy sequences are intermittently played out throughout.<br /><br />Beyond the Sea works much better in the second half, where Spacey seems to be far more comfortable playing the older Darin. When the streets full of people burst into song and dance, the old neighborhood literally waves goodbye to a suitcase-carrying Darin as he heads off to fame and fortune, it's a prophecy for what's to come - a life of celebrity, and notoriety, but it's also a life plagued by family ghosts and the specter that Darin has very limited time.<br /><br />Even though Beyond the Sea is flawed and could have been much better than it is, the film succeeds in portraying the life of a complex singer, a man who flaunted an ironic insincerity and was often driven by arrogance, ambition, cruelty, and ultimately a kind of bitter humor.

<meta name="summary" content="A brilliant, dystopian science fiction movie"></head><body><p>At the dawn of the 21st century, society was faced with a great Third World War, and knowing that something had to be done to prevent further problems, humanity was faced with the dilemma of solving all of man's troublels.  As a result, they created a new enforcer of the law, the Grammaton Clerics, a collection of warriors who practice gun kata to improve their lethality while executing their sole task of eradicating any instance of feeling within humanity.<br /><br />To control the general public, daily dosage of Prozium are self-administered, similar to the daily dosages of Soma in Brave New World, except this opiate of the masses elimites melancholy, rage, hate, and jealousy, as well as the suppressing positive feelings of pathos, joy, and love.  Similarly, destruction of all that creates feeling, literature, art, all that gives us emotion, just like the firemen in Fahrenheit 451.  Large-scale indoctrination is accomplished through the visualized, Apple commerical-esque, Big Brother screens of 1984 (used later in V for Vendetta).  The combination of the three classic dystopian tales is flawless, each blending into the other, and the collective producing realism and fear for what could easily be a not-so-distant future.<br /><br />Two Grammaton Clerics, John Preston (Christian Bale) and Errol Partridge (Sean Bean), have worked together to "protect" society.  However, Errol has been confiscating sense offender material.  Eventually, John catches Errol because he had been sneaking outside of the city to commit sense crimes.  When he is eventually uncovered face-to-face, John must bring his partner in for justice.  His partner would rather die than be captured or give up feeling, and in a final act of defiance he quotes a passage from his book and raises his book to cover his eyes.<br /><br />Partridge's final words would later haunt John in a dream, as they serve as the catalyst for his finaly memory of his wife, the moment of her sense crime incarceration and eventual incineration, and he remembers with horror his still, emotionless inaction.<br /><br />The following morning John drops his dosage of Prozium.  His sone recommends a trip to Equilibrium for a replacement dosage.  Only, John doesn't go, and he begins to feel, to sense and perceive all the wonderful feelings previously unknown.  Soon, he enjoys the touch of an intricately designed vase, cries at the sound of Beethoven, and risks everything by protecting a puppy from extermination.<br /><br />The gun battles are equisitely designed and choreographed, a little Matrix crossed with a little Jet Li action.  Christian Bale delivers an impressive performance as a man who is initially wooden, and later severely troubled by his actions.<br /><br />Eventually John must face the battle between his logic and his emotions, his allegiance and his freedom, as he comes to terms with what he has done, what he has become, and what he wishes for the future.</p></body></html>

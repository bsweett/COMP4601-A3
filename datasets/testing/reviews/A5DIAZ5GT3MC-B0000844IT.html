<meta name="summary" content="Boomstick Edition Review!"></head><body><p>The ultimate DVD version of a cult favorite has both versions of the film (one of them is the newly-restored director's cut) and every feature included on earlier VHS & DVD formats so you are pretty much getting every documentary and commentary that Anchor Bay has put out with this movie.<p>Funny thing is I own all three video formats (original Universal video, Anchor Bay's 1999 widescreen, and the original limited edition director's cut VHS) and I also bought the bootleg cut on DVD. That's right. I have now purchased this movie five different times. This one DVD has everything included on the four editions that I already purchased (with the exception of the ability to play on a VCR and give or take a few Universal Studios trailers). If only I hadn't spent over $... on those other four because I got this one for like $.... <p>Anyways, this movie is a true cult classic. The third entry in the Evil Dead series with Bruce Campbell going back in time to battle a handful of evil spirits.</p></body></html>

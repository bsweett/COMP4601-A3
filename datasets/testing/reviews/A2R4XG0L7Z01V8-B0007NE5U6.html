Fact."></head><body><p>Don't buy this movie, as you'll just regret wasting your money on a film that's not up to scratch as the original. Get it for your birthday, Christmas, or hint that you want it, but can't find it cheap enough, and some nice person will buy it for you.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting much from this movie, although I ended up watching it straight away, just to see what it was like. I already knew it wasn't going to be a patch on the original, and it was going to be totally different from the book. What I noticed was how different Bridget was from the movie. She was slightly attractive in the first movie, but in this, Renee had awful stylists etc. Her hair was a mess a lot of the time, and she had hamster cheeks. And what was equally distracting was the fact she was poured into really low cut tops a lot of the time. We all know that when Renee's not being Bridget she's ultra skinny, but in this she just wanted to flaunt her chest as much as possible! At least 50% of the world's population, if not more, have them dear, there's no need to shove them in our faces! And as for the lesbian kiss - what was the point in that, apart from the fact it was a cheap thrill for the guys? There was absolutely no need for it.<br /><br />So the film is very different from the book. Bearing in mind, I haven't read the book in a few years, so don't quote me on this. The Thai jail scene is a lot longer, and more tougher in the book. There's no Like A Virgin singalongs in that! And Bridget lost a lot of weight during her time in there (in the book), but she looked just the same when she came out. The first book was not-so-loosely based on Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice". The first movie left a lot of that in, and even included a lot of "inside jokes" for those of us who are familiar with the book and the filmed version starring Colin Firth as Fitzwilliam Darcy. "The Edge of Reason" was not-so-loosely based on another Jane Austen novel, "Persuasion," but any overt Austen references are completely wiped out here. Also, in the second book, Bridget had to interview the God in her life, Colin Firth. That would have been slightly difficult since Colin Firth is already in the movie playing of course Mark Darcy. I'm pretty sure this scene might be among the extras, but not included in the movie. Of course, they could have always done an Oceans 12, and had Colin Firth playing Mark Darcy playing Colin Firth. The mind boggles.<br /><br />Some of the movie is funny - the skiing scenes gave me flashbacks of my own skiing incidents (including dragging the instructor down the slope with me cos I was so scared), and yet again, the hair-pulling, and eye gouging between Colin Firth & Hugh Grant. But apart from that, there's nothing else that funny about the movie. It's watchable. It just doesn't have the same class as the original. At least with the second book, Helen Fielding attempted to move away from her original work, and have some fun with Bridget. This movie sticks closely to the first, with no surprises thrown in.<br /><br />Bridget's friends have a lesser part in this than the first, and they were hilarious in the first! There is also another 'friend' added who's never really introduced, but just hovering in the background.<br /><br />A lot of this movie is meant to be spent watching with a group of girlie friends, in your PJs, drinking wine, and having pillow fights. Why? Mainly because every other scene is backed by an overly loud soundtrack, featuring a lot of the songs that funnily enough on the soundtrack to the movie!!! Funnily enough, there is also a lot of drunken ballads to be sung at the top of your voice, like the "All By Myself" at the start of the first movie. Talk about over publicising the soundtrack to the movie! Also, there's a lot of product placement in this movie: Coca Cola, Vodaphone, BMI and probably more that I missed. It's very noticable product placement, not just subtle.<br /><br />The movie was better than I was expecting. But still not up to scratch. I really need to read the books again. And start keeping a diary - again.</p></body></html>

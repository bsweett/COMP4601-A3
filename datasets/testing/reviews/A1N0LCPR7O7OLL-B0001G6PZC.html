Thank God I did because it really is a good film.  Sure there are a lot of bad things some people could say about it just to be mean - I hated a lot of the editing in the beginning and that goofy fat guy from Harry Potter Prisoner From Azkaban is terrible in it (most people I know just can't stand Tom Cruise - which is unfortunate because he is  a MUCH better actor than most people give him credit for).  The whole movie is carefully balanced by tremendous action sequences in the middle and final section of the film and the sympathetic Japanese characters (Watanabe, the love interest, the kids etc...). They are all so believable and easy to connect to.  Some of the negative reviews on here (Amazon) are criticizing Cruise's performance harshly and the role his character plays in influencing the samurai/japanese people etc...Really it is Cruise's character though who learns in this movie and not the other way around which the trailer for this film so mistakenly conveyed...And unfortunately prevented me from seeing it in the theater.  And believe me when I say that I am the LAST person to want to see some movie about a "white man" (let alone one of the biggest american movie stars in the world) showing some bada#$ "samurai" how its done in the skills of fighting...But the film works people.  It isn't Gladiator or Braveheart but the characters are interesting and compelling, and many of the action sequences are truly suspenseful and entertaining...Even rousing at times.  The biggest problem I had with it was the opening (for awhile it was beginning to feel like a poor man's version of "Glory" - a perfect film in my mind which Edward Zwick also directed).  This isn't "Glory" but it isn't bad either.  Cruise is one of the best actors out there I've decided after watching this film.  People like calling him a "vanity" actor because he's such a major star and that he does roles that are in most cases larger than life...But what actor out there can honestly say they don't want that?  And besides he has done a wide array of roles and is surprisingly transformational...I say "surprisingly" simply because more people don't want to admit or recognize it...Think about how different he is in this from Born On The Fourth Of July or Collateral or Eyes Wide Shut or Color Of Money or Magnolia or Minority Report...The guy has some serious range people.  Don't be jealous 'cuz he's rich and good looking and has worked with some of the best directors ever (i.e. Oliver Stone, Kubrick, Spielberg, Scorsese, Brian De Palma, Tony Scott, Michael Mann).  Life's too short for that kinda talk people. Admit the truth...Tom Cruise is a beast of an actor and he deserves all the fame he's received whether you want to admit it or not.</p></body></html>

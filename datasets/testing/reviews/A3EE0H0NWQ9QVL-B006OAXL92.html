<meta name="summary" content="Another 'Age of Innocence'"></head><body><p>Martin Scorsese's 'Hugo' is his first family friendly entertainment, but just like all of his endeavors, his film pays dirt.  Filled with passion, innocence, yet shrouded in mystery, 'Hugo' works well by its own merits, but, having seen it in 3-D, it can't be said enough how much the enchanting story unfolds like a flowing pop-up book.  (While 'Avatar' wins the prize for being elaborate, 'Hugo's 3-D experience is more worthwhile, my best to date.)<br /><br />It is the camera lens that gives us such a wide-eyed (pun intended) view about an orphaned boy who works the clocks at a Parisian train station while trying to uncode a message from his late father.  Besides his dire circumstances, he must contend with two nemeses:  One is from the toy vendor (Ben Kingsley) at one of the train's stands and a policeman (Sacha Baron Cohen) who patrols the depot and is fond of coralling wayward orphans.<br /><br />The story is embellished by some love interests, including an unlikely girl who becomes Hugo's companion, a flower vendor (Emily Mortimer), and the toy purveyor's wife.<br /><br />Not only do the 3-D effects unveil some breathtaking cinematography, but the way both the screenwriter and Scorsese unfold secret messages, secret identities, and secret hideaways, make for a treasure chest of a movie.<br /><br />As has been stated elsewhere, 'Hugo' is a tribute to moviemaking, but it does its best work by its own merits.  'Hugo' is a triumph of filmaking and antecedently a tribute to all the geniuses, particularly one early one, who have made films a worthy and sometimes thrilling art form.</p></body></html>

Tom Cruise is actually at his best when playing a villain just like in Interview with the Vampire. Vincent is a ruthless and heartless killer and no one could play him better than Cruise. Although people are just saying now, "look at Jamie Foxx he can act". I knew for awhile that he could. Infact he should've been nominated for Ali. He's great in this too as this nice guy who hates this violent situation he's caught up in. He's funny but is also really good at being a sensitive and soft spoken actor as well.<br /><br />  Also good in supporting roles are Mark Ruffalo (13 Going on 30) as a cop who stumbles on to one of Vincent's crime scenes. Jada Pinkett Smith has good chemestry with Foxx eventhough they only have small scenes together. She plays a lawyer that Max picks up one day and they get along so well that she gives him her business card so he can call her. Collateral is suspenseful and has lots of violence but just like in Mann's Heat these 2 totally opposite guys interact and talk and get to know each other. In Heat the cop and robber sit down and talk over a cup of coffee. Here the nice taxi driver and ruthless killer talk in-between hits.</p></body></html>

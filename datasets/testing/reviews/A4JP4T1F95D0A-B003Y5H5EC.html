A possible pedophile and his 14 year old prey meet on the internet, then in person where they arrive at his house.  But the 32 year old photographer has a suprise waiting for him in a very mature, intelligent and vendictive 14 year old girl.  At first it is mental games, but then it turns physical.  The climax was somewhat expected, but not in the way it actually went down.  I was riveted the entire movie, though I don't know if it will be as interesting on a 2nd or 3rd watch.  The actors are tremendous in basically a 2 person movie with brief appearances by 3 other characters.  I had a hard time believing a 14 year old could be as smart and have a master plan as eloborate as this girl did.  Still, it is a well crafted movie and certainly worth watching.</p></body></html>

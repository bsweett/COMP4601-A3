<meta name="summary" content="Fascinating story of a passtionate but unbalanced person who drew others into his fantasies"></head><body><p>Werner Herzog has made a movie that is fascinating in many ways.  While Timothy Treadwell captivates us with a natural charisma (flowing from his very deeply self-centered view of himself and the way he projects his needs into a fantasy of the world needing him), we also watch as we would watch a train wreck or a car accident occurring right in front of us.  There is the desire to not see the horror, but we can't seem to look away from something so unusual.<br /><br />Still, for me, the more interesting part of the movie was not Timothy's stated mission of protecting the bears or his death, but the way he pulled all these other people into his orbit.  Some came in because they fell to his charisma.  Others were drawn in because of services they provided him (flying, supplies, etc.), or because Timothy moved into areas of their purview (the rangers), still others had to deal with the aftermath (the coroner).  It was these professionals that seem to have the most realistic view of what Treadwell actually accomplished, which was nearly nothing beyond self-aggrandizement.  Some might claim that he made the world more aware of the Grizzly Sanctuary.  However, it is already a protected park.  The hunting and killing of the bears if carefully controlled, and despite Treadwell's claims, poaching is all but nonexistent.<br /><br />I found the scenes with Treadwell's rantings almost embarrassing to watch.  He is clearly a person with serious emotional difficulties.  His shots of the bears are often quite beautiful.  The bear fight is quite special to see, although Treadwell's post-fight play-by-play afterward is marred by his emotionalism and is almost unintelligible, but we get the gist of it.<br /><br />It is an interesting movie.  Herzog makes it a portrait of many people through their associations with Treadwell.  He even puts in his own assessment of the assessments Treadwell made of nature and the bears, but the filmmaker never judges Treadwell severely.<br /><br />It is a touching movie, and a cautionary tale of passion going over the edge.  The one thing that struck me as I watched Treadwell wishing he could be a bear was that he got his wish.  Bears sometimes eat other bears.  Timothy was killed and eaten as a bear by an old weak and starving and ill-tempered bear.  Too bad he took his girlfriend with him.<br /><br />The extras include a documentary on the making of the music for the movie.  It was basically a group improvisation over two days with Herzog himself also directing the broad outline of what he wanted while letting the musicians provide him with what he wanted.  It is a pretty interesting documentary.</p></body></html>

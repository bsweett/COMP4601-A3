<meta name="summary" content="Controversial, Pointless, and a Blasphemous Perversion of what the X-Men stand for"></head><body><p>This film was doomed as soon as James Mardesen signed on to be Louis Lane's husband in "Superman Returns," which forced writers to kill him of.<br /><br />Folks also really need to stop blaming Bret Ratner for Cyclops' death. Are you stupid? do you even know what a director does? He has no choice when it comes to story! The film makers had no choice but to kill cyclops off because the actor that plays him was off with the original director making "Superman Returns." So if you want to blame someone for why cyclops dies in x3, blame Bryan Singer! He's the one who chose to not finish what he started! Blame actor James Mardesen, who signed on for the most worthless role in his life, playing Louis Lane's husband in a movie that was a complete downer! Bryan Singer really screwed up going for that superman movie instead on finishing his X-Men trilogy. If you listen to the audio commentary, the producers say, we had to limit cyclops' role because James was off making superman returns and was barely around to film. There you go! Stop blaming Bret Ratner for God's sake because all it shows is your ignorance!!<br /><br />I know what you are thinking. They should have hired another actor but it's not that easy. There are contractual obligations and if they wanted to use another actor they would have to pay James Mardesen thousands of dollars, which a movie studio never wants to do because they constantly want to save money and not go over budget. For example, when they killed Michael Bein off in "Alien 3" they had to pay him thousands of dollars! He made more money off dying off screen in "Alien 3" than his whole performance in "Aliens"! X3 has that "Alien 3" curse on it, where it's a good movie but there was so much standing in its way that it's not what fans expected.<br /><br />The only redeeming qualities of this film are Kelsey Grammar as beast and Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde. What a waste. I wish i could magically transport their performances into x1 or x2 but not even they could make this film very watchable. Halle Berry and Hugh were great too but that ordeal with Cyclops is like a thorn to my side and i can't get over it.<br /><br />what i hate more than what happened to Cyclops that didn't involve hollywood politics is what they did to rogue. Having her character take the cure goes against everything the x men stand for and with that i can tell you these screenplay writers don't have a clue and are blasphemous when it comes to x men. the x men are all about accepting yourself as you are and learning to control your powers!!! even in the audio commentery the writers say that the ending where she doesn't take the cure is for Rogue fans, so wouldn't they have put that in the film!!? their reasoning was because "it sucks that she can't get with nobody." what a bunch of morons. this was like watching someone piss on a church and it hurt me, more than the death of cyclops.<br /><br />Also the ending is ridiculous so magento who is the equivelant of osama bin laden is just sitting in the park playing chess and no one takes notice even though he was terrorizing the whole country and hundreds of soldiers died on alcatraz!? So, the cure still exists and everyone is happy? so jean come back only to...die again? this film was pointless. blame the screenwriters and the producers but not bret ratner.</p></body></html>

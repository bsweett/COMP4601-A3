<meta name="summary" content="Engaging Comic Horror Film"></head><body><p>"Evil Dead II" does not so much strike me as a sequel to "The Evil Dead" but a reworking of the first film.  Director Sam Raimi seems to be more confident in his prowess behind the camera as well as a storyteller.  The horror here is leavened with humor but in no way does it overwhelm it.  This is a horror film.  Bruce Campbell also developes as a performer here.  In the first film he seemed more like a nondescript college kid overwhelmed by the horror that engulfs him.  Here he comes off as not only a believable action hero but as an adept comedian.  His character evolves as the film progresses into a goofy parody of Rambo.  Groovy.</p></body></html>

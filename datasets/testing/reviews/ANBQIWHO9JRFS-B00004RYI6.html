Of course, it's best to have both, and 'Dark City' does a better job of combining bravura style with compelling plot and characters than almost anything else that I've seen.  This is a truly great flm, and at only 10 bucks you've simply gotta check this out.<br /><br />The film opens with a monologue by Dr.Schreber, which reveals the basic premise: aliens with fabulous telekinetic powers, referred to as the Strangers, have abducted numerous humans, and conduct experiments on them in the dark city, where they mix and match their memories while altering the design of the city in hopes of understanding humanity.  Shortly thereafter, John Murdoch, an experimetee who is revealed to have powers similar to the Strangers', awakes in a hotel bathtub, without any clear memories, and a dead hooker on the floor.  Natrually, the rest of the film involves his flight from both the cops and the Strangers, and his attampts to learn who he is, and the nature of the city he inhabits.  Other than those 2 there are only 3 other main characters- Emma, his supposed wife, Bumsted, the cop assigned to John's case and Mr. Hand, the Stranger who leads the search for Murdoch.  As you may imagine, there isn't all that much actual plot.  For the most part we simply have the main plot fleshed out with more details and specifics.  This may not sound terribly exciting, but they work a lot of good stuff out of this setup, and it allows for a number of revelations which I found quite effective.(though more astute viewers will likely see them coming)  Perhaps most significantly, I find it quite personally involving, and think the major positive characters to be extremely symphathetic.  This is largely because I find the major thematics elements behind the film to be quite important.  At the risk of becoming too philosophical, I feel that the loss of a sense of reality or self is just about the most terrifying notion there is, which makes me naturally symphathetic to these characters, as this loss is precisely what they're dealing with.  Though what it says about humanity isn't necessarily profound (though not much ever is) and perhaps a bit heavy-handed at times,  but it's significant enough to me that I don't mnd much.<br /><br />The acting is generally excellent, and those who may suggest that some of the characters are a bit to cliched are missing the point entirely.(though I will say that I think Kiefer Sutherland's performance as Schreber a bit too affected, but the film is strong in general.)  Also, the casting is absolutely perfect, particularly Connelly, Hurt and O'Brien as Emma, Bumsted and Mr. Hand respectively.  They look exactly the way they should.(and give fine performances, too) While there really isn't all that much too them, I think the bald, pale Strangers make fine villains.  I'm particularly fond of the sadistic Mr. Hand, and the creepy little kid stranger, Mr. Sleep.<br /><br />Visually, 'Dark City' is like little else your likely to see in modern film.  Stylistically, it is what is commonly referred to as 'tech-noir', naturally combining science fiction elements with extreme grittiness, darkness and urban decay of the noir film.  Obviously, it's a very dark film, all black and brown and bronze or faded, sickly green, the indoors bathed in shadow, the outdoors dank and wet, lit by little more than the neon lights.  Visually, the city itself it manages to fall in an area where things don't necessarily look utterly phony, but they don't really look real either.(And this is exactly as it should look)  The shots are beautifully composed, with a strong sense of harmony and balance.  It is very frantically edited, frequently cutting between a few static shots repeatedly, but in a way that isn't annoying, and is decidedly appropriate thematically.<br /><br />The film fails slightly during the climax.  It goes a bit too far over the top, and goes on too long.  Still it's a minor failing.  Fortunately, the denoumont is quite strong. (spoliers ahead)  I have only a slight streak of sentimentality in me, and this is one of the few films that can exploit it.  But what can I say, I want things to turn out well for John, and it's just an absolutely great moment when  the sun finally rises over the city.<br /><br />Well, you just have to see it.  Do so.</p></body></html>

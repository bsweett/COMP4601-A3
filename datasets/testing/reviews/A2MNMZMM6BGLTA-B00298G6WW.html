<meta name="summary" content="Hilarious!"></head><body><p>I thought this movie was just hilarious the first time I saw it. Pierce Brosnan shines and shows that he is more than just 007. He was hilarious as the sleazy assassin going thru a midlife crisis.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to just about any adult that likes good slighty naughty humor.</p></body></html>

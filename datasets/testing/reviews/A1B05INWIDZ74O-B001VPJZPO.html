John Hurt had the most challenging role. His character Ben is not able to talk in this movie yet we can see the anguish and fear he is trying to show us. Best job of the lot.<br /><br />The film is well written and directed. We are given enough clues throughout the movie to figure out what is happening. But not enough to ruin the suspense. This is one of the few movies I almost had to wait for the end to know what was going on. The story knows how to keep us on the edge of the seat in suspense. And when the end finally does come. We are offerred an extra bang for our dollar when it all makes sense. You will finally see the string of clues that lead to the very ending. Though I must admit you really have to pay attention to figure it before they show you. Good luck, it is worth it.</p></body></html>

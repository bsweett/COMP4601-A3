The movie starts with the penguins jumping out of the sea and starting their 70 plus mile march to the interior where they mate and lay eggs. As the director states in his commentary, one would think this would be comic, but the penguins are majestic in their way. The 70-mile trek is only the beginning of their difficulties. How the penguins survive in an Antartic winter and keep the eggs warm and then the hatchlings fed and warm is an amazing story.<br /><br />The soundtrack is good. Morgan Freeman's voice over is pertinent and not obtrusive. The scenery is magnificient. The direction has a perfect touch. The DVD extras include the director's commentary, "Of Penguins and Men;" a cartoon that is a Merry Melodies short, and a crittercam mini-documentary. All were decent. I strongly recomend the DVD.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not just a movie..."></head><body><p>but a major event in American movie history.  Friday evening, March 24, 1933, was when the motion picture changed forever.  A movie with horror, romance, action, adventure, and full of trills.  King Kong was a masterpiece of story and special effects and NOW it is back newly restored and digitally mastered with TONS of extras.  Besides the commentary you can listen to during the movie there is a second disc full of features, from The Making of Kong to a documentary on RKO Radio Pictures, plus postcards, a 20 page reproduction of the original 1933 program and much more.  Hours more!<br />And the film has been restored - all the scenes that were cut out have been replaced!<br />Pop the popcorn, dim the lights and enjoy one of the best movies EVER made.  All in a cool tin!</p></body></html>

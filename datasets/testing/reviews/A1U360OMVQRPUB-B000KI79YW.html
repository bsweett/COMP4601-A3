<meta name="summary" content="Solid Suspense Story"></head><body><p>I had a good time with this one.  There were no real surprises, but everyone connected with the movie delivered great performances that allowed the story to progress at a rapid, suspenseful pace that never broke.<br /><br />Michael Douglas stars as Pete Garrison, a seasoned Secret Service agent who took a bullet meant for Ronald Reagan.  He's ageing comfortably well and spending his life in service to the office of the President as a personal protector to the First Lady.  Unfortunately, Garrison has also fallen in love with Sarah Ballentine and he's been compromised for some time.<br /><br />In short order, a plot to kill the president is discovered.  All indications are that the plot is coming from within the Secret Service.  They go on a mole hunt at the same time one of Garrison's confidential informers tells him about the mole.  Someone also knows about Garrison's affair with the first lady.<br /><br />After a few tense cat-and-mouse moments, Garrison is placed in the cross-hairs of the Secret Service investigation.  His one-time best friend David Breckinridge (Keifer Sutherland) comes after him with a vengeance because he believes Garrison had an affair with his wife.  Eva Longoria stars as new Secret Service recruit Jill Marin.<br /><br />The movie evolves into a series of chases and mystery-solving that runs tight and neat to the end, although it doesn't really break any new ground.  The movie is a great rental for movie night for both sexes that enjoy suspense stories with well-choreographed action sequences.<br /><br />I watched the Blu-ray version.  The audio and video formatting are excellent and are both uncompressed, giving the viewer the best experience possible if they have an HD monitor and surround sound system.</p></body></html>

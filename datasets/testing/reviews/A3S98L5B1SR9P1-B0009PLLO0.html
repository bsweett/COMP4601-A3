<meta name="summary" content="The Director's Cut is excellent!"></head><body><p>I like Oliver Stone's films, and reviews of this film lead me to believe that this film would suck, although some claimed it's actually a good film and is underrated. From what I read on the "Alexander" IMDB boards, more people prefer the director's cut of the movie rather than the theatrical cut (and that's usually the case). Apparently, the DC is somewhat like the TC, except that it's eight minutes shorter, and switches scenes around to "help the story flow better". Hmm. So I thought to myself: "I do like Oliver Stone's films (my favorite being JFK), and he really hasn't let me down yet". IMDB's rating for Alexander is 5.5, but then again, I don't really trust IMDB's ratings, due to the fact that most users either vote a 1 or a 10, which explains how the Lord of the Rings trilogy is on the IMDB Top 250 films of all time list. I read RT, and they give Alexander a 14%, but then again, they allow anyone with a website to comment on movies. I also read that this is one film where you definitely WANT to ignore the critics on.<br /><br />WELL, I finally decided to give this film a chance, and rented this film (the director's cut version) last night. This movie was much better than the reviews I've read and heard said it would be. The action was completely believable. The effects were phenomenal during the battle scenes. As for historical epics, this movie was not as good as Gladiator or Braveheart, of course, but I still enjoyed this film. Overall, probably the most underrated film of 2004.</p></body></html>

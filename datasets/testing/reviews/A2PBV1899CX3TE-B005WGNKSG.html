<meta name="summary" content="M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor"></head><body><p>M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor, or The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo, as it is known in the U.S., is based on the first of Stieg Larssons three bestselling novels. M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor translates to "men who hate women." Larssons had intended a 10 novel series, but the three published novels form a sort of trilogy by themselves. He calls it The Millenium Trilogy. The novels were published posthumously, and he had some notes and other unfinished books, but these three books would seem to be his legacy. The film is in Swedish with English subtitles. I enjoy foreign films and don't mind reading the subtitles. I like hearing the films in their original tongue. Swedish has a mysterious sound, vaguely Germanic--nothing at all like the Swedish cook on The Muppets.<br /><br />I saw this film at the Majestic Fox Theater in Bakersfield, a vintage movie palace restored to its former glory, as the kick off to FLICS, the foreign film club that allows the good folks of Bakersfield the opportunity to see foreign films that they might not otherwise be able to. The huge theater was packed, and I had no idea what a buzz this film had going for it, fueled no doubt by the bestselling books by Stieg Larssons.<br /><br />Directed by Niels Arden Oplev, starring Michael Nyqvist as investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist, and Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander, the dragon tattooed girl who is paid to hack into Blomkvist's personal files, but then becomes his ally. It is at once an action packed mystery, a study of abuse victims, a story of female empowerment, and an unlikely romance. Though the film has graphic scenes of sex and violence, you never get the feeling that it is gratuitous, just that it is necessary to tell the story of Lisbeth, and how she came to be the way she is. How she refused to be a victim, and fought back against those who would try to oppress her. In some ways, she is like a punk rock female Charles Bronson in his vigilante/revenge mode. She looks like Lady Gaga, but with piercings, and instead of outrageous dresses made out of meat, she wears the black pants and leather jacket of a biker. She is an abuse victim, but when she fights back, you are with her all the way.<br /><br />In some ways the movie is an unlikely romance, or a wish fulfillment fantasy of older men who'd like to be swept off their feet by some hot young hacker on a motor bike. However, it is handled so delicately, and the character of Blomkvist is so pure of heart--he only wants to get at the truth and expose evil and corruption--so you never feel like he is just some D.O.M. (dirty old man). You don't feel like a voyeur watching the movie, either. Though there are some graphic scenes, they don't dwell on anything more than it would take to tell the story. The audience I saw it with covered a wide range of ages, from young adult to seniors, and everyone seemed to enjoy it immensely. They liked having their cake and eating it, too.<br /><br />As good as Nyquist is at conveying the purity of Blomqvist, the character who you'll be thinking about the most in the days to come is Lisbeth Salander, as excellently portrayed by Noomi Rapace. She already had the holes from piercings in her younger punk rocker days, so they had only to paint on the tattoos to transform her into Lisbeth. Throughout many harrowing scenes, she never broke character. Though she tended to have almost a poker face, you really got the feeling that she was a real person going through all these ordeals, and of course, parts of her thoughts were a mystery, but other feelings could be easily read as if they were written in flaming letters 12 feet high.<br /><br />She inhabits her role so thoroughly that there is talk of a boycott unless they use Noomi to play Lisbeth in the English language version scheduled to begin shooting in 2011 with director David Fincher (Fight Club). I don't know that an English language version is necessary, but if anyone is going to do it, it might as well be David Fincher. I hope they do use Noomi, though The Bottom Line is I would find it hard to boycott, regardless of who played Lisbeth.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030745455X">The Girl Who Played with Fire (Vintage)</a> by Stieg Larssons<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030726999X">The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest</a> by Stieg Larssons<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307454541">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a> by Stieg Larssons<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0033HWZS2">The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest DVD (Luftslottet som sprangdes) [Imported] [Region 2 DVD] (Swedish)</a> (2009)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YOZNAG">The Girl Who Played With Fire</a> (2009)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TZS5GK">Worlds Apart</a> (2008) Directed by Niels Arden Oplev<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OTZO5M">We Shall Overcome</a> (2006) Directed by Niels Arden Oplev<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002W1HBM0">As It Is in Heaven</a> (2004) Michael Nyqvist was Daniel Dar&eacute;us<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PJYPYG">Downloading Nancy</a> (2008) Michael Nyqvist was Stan<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H5RCXA">Daisy Diamond  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - Sweden </a>] (2007) Noomi Rapace was Anna</p></body></html>

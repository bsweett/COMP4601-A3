People were getting pierced through the chest, blood was seeping in the weapons, and there was a brief decapitation, yet why were the bad guys turn into green smoke when they're killed?  The movie never explained why they evaporate into green gas, so there's no point for the violent director's cut to not just leave them as corpses.  It's about as pointless as the making of this movie.<br /><br />"Elektra" is an underwhelming, unnecessary spinoff to a below-par superhero movie.  There isn't much to tell about Elektra that I should care about, it's just another boring revenge/redemption tale that's already been told in "Daredevil".  It started off with a pointless entry scene when she assassinated some guy, and then she was tasked to kill a family of two but then she suddenly had a change of heart due to mommy issues and thus she's defending them while fighting against the one that killed her family (or at least her mother, it never showed what happened to her pappy).  I never really liked the daughter and father of the targeted family, the daughter comes off as selfish, even after the revelation about her was given, while the father is for the most part irrelevant.  These two are mostly there to intrude Elektra's actions, and characters who interfere are never likable.  As for the villains, members of The Hand, it's amazing how they're initially portrayed as a powerful force and the organization became less relevant as the plot goes on, leading to only a few baddies taking action.  The supervillains actually look cool in design (except for that Poison Ivy rip-off), that Tattoo guy given special notice, but how they're defeated was very anti-climatic.<br /><br />The plot is secondary to special effects, and even then, the special effects were poorly done.  They tried too hard to show off, and a couple of effects were blatantly obviously like the bracelet attack by a certain character.  Most of the effects are even impractical, like how that main villain can quick-dash which leaves a trail and yet why doesn't he used that technique AND attack his foe at the same time.  A lot of characters used that quick move to appear and reappear on screen, yet I find that to be a lazy effect.  As lousily-written and below-par "Elektra" is, it does have one incredible moment worth mentioning: an evil ninja breaking his own neck without using his limbs; that was the best part of the whole movie.</p></body></html>

It took far to long to come to fruition. For years we drooled over the rumor mill of an Atlantean adventure amongst others, but in the end it's as though they threw something together to finally get it done. Not the clever dialogue, suspense, or exciting action we hoped would end the series. The question now is, will it be carried on by a young "Mutt" played by Shia LaBeouf? Is Mutt a reference to the another dogs name Indiana took? After all perhaps they felt like father like son using dog names. The younger audience may feel this is the same kind of fun that the previous movies offered, but it is doubtful the original fans will be so forgiving. It was nice of them to give a nod to the "Pancho Villa" episode of the "Young Indiana Jones" series.  If you enjoyed this movie, catch the more enjoyable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009NSCRQ">The Librarian - Quest for the Spear</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002J58GU">King Solomon's Mines</a> with Patrick Swayze.<br /><br />CA Luster</p></body></html>

I like Kate Winslet (especially in "Hideous Kinky" and "Titanic"), am not a fan of Jim Carrey. This film has it's moments, but gets too intricate and complex towards the end.  If you suffer from dyslexia, for get about it!  I aprreciated the cinematography, but the story, I could care less.  Art house types probably drool over this film, I'm like eh,yeah uh huh................WHO CARES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Next please!</p></body></html>

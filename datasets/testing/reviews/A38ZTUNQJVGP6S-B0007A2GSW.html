The Incredibles tells the story of Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible) who in his heyday belong to a group of super heroes who belong to the NSA (National Supers Agency). After he saves a man life and the lives of people on a train, people begin suing Mr. Incredible and later on other supers. The supers are forced into retirement and to lead normal lives. It is fifteen years later and Bob and Helen (his wife and former Elastigirl) have three kids and Bob works as works at Insuricare where helps client find loopholes in their claims if they are turned down. This is a job that Bob does not like and hates his boss even worse because he is heartless and only cares about making a profit. Bob winds up getting fired because he threw Gilbert Huph (his boss) through five walls because he would not let Bob prevent a person getting mugged and when the person is mugged Mr. Huph mocks the victims. Bob is now home and unemployed again and has not told his wife about what happened at work. While going through is briefcase he discovers an envelop and opens it up and there is a message like the one seen in the opening scene in the Mission Impossible TV show; even exploding ten seconds after it is played and causing the house water sprinkling system to go off. There is a message from a person who call herself Mirage and offers Mr. Incredible a job and that would pay him three times his yearly salary. Bob accepts the offer and heads to the island to destroy the Omnidroid. Mr. Incredible is out of shape and his back seems to out on him at times when he is fighting the Omnidroid; in the end Mr. Incredible defeats the Omnidroid. While Bob is waiting for his next assignment, he works out in a train while Helen is thinking he is at work. Also Bob is getting reconnected with his family and is no longer miserable. One day Bob visits Edna Mode to have his original super suit mended. Edna wants to make Bob a new suit and throw away the old one claiming she does not look back. Edna agrees to repair the old suit while at the same time making Bob a new suit. Mr. Incredible is called back to the island for a new assignment and finds out that new Omnidroid that has been update is ready to take on Mr. Incredible. It is during this fight with the machine that Syndrome is controlling the machine. Syndrome at one time was Incredi-Boy for a few brief minutes of his life. Buddy Pine, Incredi-Boy, wanted to be Mr. Incredible sidekick but told Buddy to go home because he worked alone. Syndrome uses the Omnidroid and his zero-point technology to toss Mr. Incredible around. It is with his zero-point technology that Syndrome tosses Mr. Incredible too far and accidently let him escapes. Mr. Incredible is able to save himself by swimming into a cave and hiding behind the dead skeleton of Gazerbeam. Mr. Incredible is able to sneak back into the cave and finds the information about the other Supers who have been killed by earlier models of the Omnidroid and only Elastigirl and Frozone are the only two who remain alive. Meanwhile Helen visits Edna who believes know something about Bob whereabouts. Edna thinks that Helen is here to get the new Super suits she has made for the family. While at Edna's place, Helen finds out the Bob has not been working at Insuricare the last two months and thinks he is cheating on her. Edna tells Helen to fight for her husband and go and get him. Helen charters a plane to find Bob and does not know that Dash and Violet have sneaked aboard. Back at the island Mr. Incredible has been caught when his homing signal went off; a device he did not know he had. Mr. Incredible is now a prisoner of Syndrome and Syndrome begins to torture him. He wants to know how is on the plane and makes Mr. Incredible listen to a radio transmission. Mr. Incredible recognizes the voice of Helen but does not tell Syndrome about his relationship to her. Syndrome sends out heat seeking missiles to destroy the jet and succeeds in doing so. Unknown to Syndrome and Mr. Incredible, Helen, Violet, and Dash all survive the plain wreck and make it to the island. Helen leaves the children in a cave and goes to look for Bob. She finds Bob and the two make a break from the cave and eventually hook up with their children. Syndrome is able to recapture them and is surprised to learn the Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl are married and got busy, my favorite line in the movie even if I did quote it correctly. Violet is able to use her force field powers and is able to free the family. The Incredibles with the assistant of Mirage fly a rocket back to Metroville where the Omnidroid is set loose of the city and Syndrome tries to destroy his own machine but is knocked unconscious in the fight. The Incredibles and Frozone fight to destroy the Omnidroid and are successful in doing so. Syndrome is enraged and heads to the home of Parrs. Syndrome kidnaps Jack-Jack and flies out of the house with him. Jack-Jack is scared and begins to turn into a ball of fire, lead weight, and a devilish creature. This causes Syndrome to drop Jack-Jack and Elastigirl rescues her son. Mr. Incredible throws his new car at Syndrome which causes his cape to get caught in one of his jet engines and that blows up the plane and kills Syndrome. The Incredibles is the first Pixar movie to have human only in it. Also the computer animation is great too.

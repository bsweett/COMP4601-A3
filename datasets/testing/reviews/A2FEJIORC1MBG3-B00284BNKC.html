<meta name="summary" content="Aronofsky's a genius...just ask him."></head><body><p>Another overrated entry in the Quickly Becoming Tiresome &quot;junkie chic&quot; genre. A lonely widow (Ellen Burstyn) gets strung out on a &quot;Mother's Little Helper&quot; regimen of diet and sleeping pills prescibed by her quack physician. Meanwhile, her son (Jared Leto),his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) and his buddy (Marlon Wayans) are busy destroying thier lives with heroin. And that's our &quot;plot&quot;...Drugs Are Bad (ho-hum). With neither a compelling central narrative nor sympathetic character in sight, be prepared for a VERY long 2 hours. I was roped in by the hype surrounding Burstyn's performance, and while she is excellent as always, this is nowhere near her best work (check out &quot;King Of Marvin Gardens&quot; just for starters). Director Darren Aronofsky appears to be more determined to showcase his own visual technique over performances, so any subtle acting nuances are bludgeoned by annoying camera/editing tricks. There are far too many gross-out scenes (unless your idea of a good time at the movies includes watching beautiful Jennifer Connelly vomit into the camera, or a lingering close-up of a needle spiking into a pus-swollen abcess). The &quot;What...that's IT?!&quot; ending really puts the capper on an alltogether unpleasant movie experience.</p></body></html>

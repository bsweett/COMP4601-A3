<meta name="summary" content="0 STARS: House of 1,000 Fecees"></head><body><p>"House of a 1,000 Corpses" is not worth a serious review.  In short, this movie was another attempt to borrow from the original classic "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (as so many have tried to do and have failed before this); however, this does not even come close to being scary or horrifying like the original "TCM".  IT IS A TOTAL JOKE!!!  I wasted my time watching this trash, so I'm not going to waste much of my time writing about this trash.  If you want a good scary horror movie about crazy backwoods killers, you need to watch the original "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre".  If you want to waste your time watching rubbish that is about as interesting as watching paint dry and about as scary as Mr. Rogers, you need to purchase "House of 1,000 Fecees" immediately.  In all honesty, I would call "House of 1000 Corpses" a stupid person's black comedy, but that's about it.</p></body></html>

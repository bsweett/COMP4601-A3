Murray Abraham is a supperior cut since it allows the viewer to better understand the relationship between Mozart and Sallieri. It also adds valuable scenes for instance when Constanza Mozart is turned down by Salieri. For my part they could have added even more since I absloutely love this movie and I think they could have fleshed out some scenes even more (like another 30 minutes or so). F. Murray Abraham is stupendous in his role as Salieri and Tom Hulce is also great in his interpretation of Mozart. I love the music, the costumes and the scenery of this amazing movie and I think it is a movie not to be missed. Most definitely reccommended.</p></body></html>

Not quite as good as Spiderman - I think the emotional intensity & character sympathy is a bit diluted from spreading it out among more characters - but it gives the X-Men a run for their money.  Batman Begins is somewhat more serious, maybe a better movie in some serious ways, but Fantastic Four is, overall, probably the most fun movie out currently.  They give the origin so you can understand and enjoy the film just as well if you've never read the comic.  The Four are exposed to DNA altering radiation in space, and each exhibits different symptoms manifested as superpowers.  Ben, The Thing, is super strong and tough, appearing as though he's made of rock.  Johnny (Torch) can start fire at will and turn himself into a blazing, flying fireball.  Reed (Stretch) can stretch his body like tough, flexible rubber to indefinite proportions.  Sue, the Invisible Girl, is the invisible girl.  Unfortunately a fifth was exposed, becoming supervillain Doc Doom.  The Thing wants to be changed back to Ben, but Torch wants to exploit their new abilities for fame and fortune.  Reed works to reverse the process, but Von Doom starts interfering for his own motives.  Recommended for the whole family.</p></body></html>

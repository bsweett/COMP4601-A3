The "Descendants" was a surprisingly warm, entertaining and thoughtful film. It deals specifically with a family going through a specific tragedy and dealing with that tragedy and all the secrets they never knew existed.<br /><br />George Clooney pulls an emotionally charged and compassionate performance as a father dealing with his wife and her near fatal accident. (Played by Patricia Hastie of "Lost", basically playing a invalided accident victim - no dialogue at all.)  He needs to deal with the solitude of losing a wife and dealing with estranged children who are remarkably good actors themselves. The oldest daughter is played by Shailene Woodley ("The OC", "Secret Life Of An American Teenager")  and the youngest daughter  played by Amara Miller (in her very first project ever).<br /><br />What made this movie so good for me was the complexity of Clooney's character and the depth he went to in order to deal with a big family secret, an estranged daughter, a curious daughter and a dying wife. It felt real and heartwarming to see his friends and a new real estate agent and his wife literally turn his world upside down!  Try keeping a dry eye during this film.<br /><br />The movie feature a completely Hawaiian underscore with classic songs and ukulele strums as well as a realistic look at life in the modern day Hawaiian Islands. The greenery, the land, the ocean and even the never seen rural areas of middle-class homes - all are woven in such detail as to only enhance the story.<br /><br />The cast includes some other incredible performances by Mathew Lillard ("Scooby Doo", "Madd TV") , Judy Greer ("What Women Want', "13 Going on 30")  and Beau Bridges ("Fabulous Baker Boys", "Stargate").<br /><br />Overall this movie has a lot to offer. Real-life drama and passion and the only thing that might be off setting is that the "R" rating for this movie is because of the language. (Which includes the kids.) I can see why it's winning all the awards and the fact it is currently up for  five Academy Award Nominations including;  Actor In a Leading Role - George Clooney, Best Picture, Directing -Alexander Payne, Film Editing - Kevin Tent, and Writing (Adapted Screenplay) - Alexander Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash.<br /><br />A very well made film.</p></body></html>

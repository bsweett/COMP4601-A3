When I saw it, nothing in the trailers or word of mouth spoiled that twist for me. Hopefully, I won't spoil it for readers.<br /><br />Both Diablo Cody, the writer, and Ellen Page, the spirit behind the lead role, Juno (a 16 year old high school junior), have been nominated for awards in countless venues. Page is a veteran, having started in Canadian television when she was only 10. Diablo Cody logs her first screenplay for Juno, and she was working on TV scripts for the film's director, Jason Reitman, at least until the strike. Diablo's irreverence was first launched publicly with her 2006 autobiography, "Candy Girl" and yes, she lived and wrote about her life as a young stripper.<br /><br />In the trade-off of writing vs. acting talent, there would be few kudos for writer Cody's material in the hands of an actress less talented than Page (just 20, but plays 16 easily). Conversely, Page, who has played in several Canadian television series and some small films (the most notable of which is the 2005 film about pedophilia, "Hard Candy"), has never been given material of this nature. The pairing of Cody's acerbic writing with Page's quirky film persona was as successful as the casting of Abigail Breslin as Olive in Little Miss Sunshine. Molding writing and actress is young director Jason Reitman, who has already had one independent hit with "Thank You for Smoking" .<br /><br />Together, the three create a perfectly believable, nerdy 16 year old who has enough self-confidence to overcome her birth mother's desertion in her early childhood and her seemingly artless and uncanny ability to fit into a school situation where she understands all the teenage politics and is able to navigate cheerfully on the fringes of many high school communities.  Juno simply has no artifice.<br /><br />Over time, we glimpse that Juno has a passion for music, has played guitar in a teenage band, has two close friends: Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera in a great performance), who was also in the band and is perhaps the shy, male equivalent of Juno's smart outsider, and Leah (Olivia Thirlby) a popular cheerleader who prefers hanging with Juno to hanging with cooler kids in school.<br /><br />Without a lot of forethought, Juno has enticed Paulie into turning a make out session in his room to their first sexual adventure. From the opening of the film, which is colorful and clever, she's become aware that this experiment has left her pregnant. Everyone who she consults from that point, from girlfriend Leah, to the stunned Bleeker, to her parents (J.K. Simmons as her blue collar dad, Mac Macguff and Alison Janney as her stepmom, Bren), to the people who observe her in the school - all of them express no recrimination, and (this is the 21st century, and unfortunately, teenage pregnancy has been out in the open for far too long!) are simply puzzled by why Juno would have something so out-of -character happen to her. Juno, after all, is too smart for her 16 years, absolutely forthcoming with her thoughts and opinions, and not at all a teenage Lolita. Both Juno and Paulie are exactly the opposite of what you would expect teenage parents-to-be; seeming innocents with chutzpah. How did this happen?<br /><br />Although Juno considers abortion, her inquiry into the process leaves her running in another direction, and she decides to give the baby up to someone who really wants a baby. There is never any doubt that Juno knows that keeping the baby is above and beyond what she should expect herself to be able to do. Her maturity in making her own decision and finding a couple (in the Penny Saver!) who sound like good adoptive parents is in keeping with her positive outlook on this. Both Mac and Bren (who are absolutely great in small roles) treat her decisions with respect and are supportive of her in the process. Mac goes to meet the adoptive couple with her.<br /><br />To say that Juno is charming is to describe her meeting with the adoptive parents, the Lorings. Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) is obsessive about becoming a mother and finds it difficult to believe that the reality has walked in the door. Mark (Jason Bateman) is as acerbic as is Juno, and like a few of the other adults that surround her, he senses right from the beginning that she is a kindred soul - honest, forthright, a little eyebrow raising.<br /><br />All does not go smoothly through Juno's pregnancy journey, and the film allows her to pluckily downplay the difficulities she has with her changing body, with people's reaction to her, with her confused and mixed feelings about the Lorings, and about Paulie.<br /><br />In the denouement, you'll have come to know Juno well enough to predict what will happen, and enjoyed your time with her enough to leave the film with a smile on your face. A somewhat black comedy.....yes, but heartwarming and real, along the lines of Searchlight's 2006 hit, "Little Miss Sunshine".<br /><br />With some fine supporting performances (Garner's Vanessa becomes truly real when she bumps into Juno in a mall and is coerced into talking to the bump and feeling for an early kick) and a truly effervescent musical score, Juno is not just for teenagers (in fact, it's not for teenagers at all) it has charm for everyone. A light, entertaining, but thought-provoking film, Juno is sure to be on your list of top 10 films for 2007. Go see it!</p></body></html>

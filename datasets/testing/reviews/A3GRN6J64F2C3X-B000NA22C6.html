It also helps that, while a serious effort, the film isn't full of its own importance and gets its business over with in a shade over 90 minutes.  And for those interested in such things, the extras are quite generous.  The featurettes alone clock in at over an hour when one hits the &quot;play all&quot; icon, and there's a director's commentary, too.</p></body></html>

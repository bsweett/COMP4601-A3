<meta name="summary" content="Almost as Good as the Landmark Original"></head><body><p>The first ten minutes of this remake of George A. Romero's Dawn of the dead should have been flaunted on television as it was on the Monday before it's opening on the USA network. What an amazing start, few times am I moved by actions or horrors, (as this is both) but the sheer power and fear generated by this opening sequence is what sets the stage for this film. It is all down hill from there but the film does manage to do what few remakes do, and that is stand on it's own as a decent movie overall.<br /><br />The original Dawn of the Dead kept the zombies in slow motion but never turned away when they got a victim pinned down and the remake doesn't even come close to the violence or pure horror of the original (nothing does, it's one of the greatest horror films ever made).  It does however remain a suspenseful action/horror film that has you rooting for the good guys...and sometimes the zombies.  It is entertaining despite it's flaws.  Director Zack Snyder has a tremendous amount of mainstream appeal.  All of the film's outstanding strengths are directorial in nature.  The cast was also strong.  Ving Rhames revisits his type castings here but is enjoyable despite being written inconsistently.  Sarah Polley breaks her independant film mold and chooses a strange film to do so.  She is a good screamer (albeit very cliche) character.  She pulls it off well enough to conveniently veil the film's writing flaws.  The film has a decent cast in the forefront but drops off big time from there.  You will see the screenplay's very worst lines delivered the way they would be delivered in a Sleepaway Camp film.<br /><br />Speaking of the screenplay, it is the only real stand-out problem.  Dawn of the Dead is unique in that the screenplay is really sort of bunched up in bad dialogue and cheap copied ideas from bad movies, but it is forgiven for the most part by it's surprising aforementioned strengths.  We go by the action/horror film book page by page in this film but it manages to come off as different because of the new zombies we have, compliments to the mainstream success of the remarkably refreshing 28 Days Later.  I will admit laughing out loud at least a half dozen times at some one liners and busting a gut at the celebrity shooting scene on the roof of the mall.  You will too but if you plan on taking this remake seriously you may feel guilty about it.<br /><br />So how does it compare to the original?  Well, Snyder and company played it safe and made a very different film with fast zombies, no consistent or obvious social commentary, a wider and more diluted cast and some very fancy and super cool action shots.  It's colorful, it's packed with explosions, blood and  shooting; it's creepy and the zombies are almost as much fun as they were in Return of the Living Dead.  Unfortunately it sacrifices the depth and sheer terror of the original so it simply cannot be compared.<br /><br />All in all the film's flaws can be ignored because this film worked for me.</p></body></html>

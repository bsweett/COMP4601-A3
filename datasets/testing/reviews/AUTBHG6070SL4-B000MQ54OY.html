Action is livelier, textures are more lifelike, and even industrial geometries come to life forbiddingly. Fer cryin' out loud, they got fat dumpy penguins dancing like hot human babes - who'd have guessed? I'm jaded, though. I've come to expect artistic and expressive breakthroughs in computer animation. If they upend the whole game board on schedule, when they're supposed to, I can only be politely impressed.<br /><br />But I'm really impressed. They got everything right - even the people. If those were real people, esp. that little girl, then accept my apology, because I thought they were animations (except that bunch at the end). They got the mood right, family tensions (OK, not deep, but way over the bar for a kid's movie), determination, and making friends with folks who look different. They also offer some really cool water ballet, the kind you'd learn from the Blue Angels. This may be just a little intense at times, if you have small and skittish kids, but that's just because a world of carnivores has intense moments in it, like it or not. The mommy/daddy thing is tasteful, loving, and biologically vague.<br /><br />It's not just for kids, though. It has the kind of wit, the kind of musical and cultural literacy that keeps the grownups engaged, too. (You bought the tickets, you deserve at least as much as your young'uns.) Robin Williams bounces suitably off the wall, though not so much as in Robots. Everyone puts in good voices, which is kind of unfortunate. The real star power here came from the anonymous geeks who programmed the physics for penguin bone and blubber, then put a human spirit into it. Maybe it's a compliment that the great voice actors sank so silently behind their characters - I'm more impressed by the mathematical feat of computing how fuzz on baby penguins catches the light, then forcing me and everyone else into an "Awww, cute!" response by means of that arithmetic mastery.<br /><br />I could pick a few nits, like the very odd schedule on which Mumble sheds his juvenile coat so long after his peers, but only a few. And, if I did, it just wouldn't be any fun. This movie is fun, not to make fun of. It's also a pretty fair 100-minute treat for fans of a capella music. It's not my style, but it finally made me understand why people buy movie soundtracks.<br /><br />//wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release</p></body></html>

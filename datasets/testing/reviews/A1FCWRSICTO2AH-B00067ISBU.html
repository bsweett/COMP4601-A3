One reason may be that Hellboy lifts, pretty blatantly, from a number of those films.  You will find yourself often recalling scenes from other films.  And that's ok, Spielburg has made quite a career from such a practice, though his lift jobs are usually from older, somewhat forgotten greats.  Hellboy just says to heck with this memory thing, and lets rip. To some extent this makes for a crowded movie.  In contrast, look how Spiderman makes much of just one super villain per movie.<br /><br />Perlman is excellent as Hellboy. He plays the part like some orange, mutant looking, cigar chomping, Sgt. Fury.  Also of note, is Liz (played by the lovely Selma Blair) as the Firestarter.  She's just one of those actresses that has "It," just by being on screen (see: Scarlet Johansson).  The story is basically a comic book, the violence, bloodless.  You got those reliable bad guys, the Nazis (with some help from Rasputin) seeking to open up another world and let the tentacled baddies come rolling in (very Cthulu Mythos by the way).  Hellboy slugs and wisecracks his way through the evil mumbo jumbo, while keeping a protective eye out for his beloved Liz, who can take care of herself in a very explosive way.  That's pretty much it.  Nothing great, but definitely worth a watch.</p></body></html>

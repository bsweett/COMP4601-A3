<meta name="summary" content="A very brutal and very stylish film noir"></head><body><p>First of all, this Robert Rodriguez film of Frank Miller's graphic comic books is mostly in B&W, not color as advertised.  This is ideal for the material, but may have accounted for deserted theaters the second week of its release.  It is a brutally violent film noir, co-directed and co-written by Miller and Rodriguez; Rodriguez, who also cut and photographed this baby, wanted a flawless translation of Miller's inky B&W comic book novels.  So, we have a movie that is 90% B&W and incredibly violent.  Let's get that out of the way up front.<br /><br />Basin City at night becomes a nightmare film noir city of awful violence and evil characters, in B&W with dabs of color now and then--a red dress and red bedspread, a woman with gold hair, a zombie with bald gold head, a blue car--in an otherwise B&W landscape.  The art direction and visual effects are stunning and make SIN CITY worth recommending.<br /><br />Rodriguez and Miller basically have three stories to tell that all take place in Basin City at night--(1) Bruce Willis as a retired cop with a bad heart who wants to save exotic dancer Jessica Alba; (2) a heavily made-up Mickey Rourke as a prizefighter out to avenge the death of his beloved girlfriend; and (3) Clive Owen in a very complex tale of Old Town prostitutes and a guy who wants to save one of them from psychopath Benicio Del Toro.<br /><br />You will probably either love or hate SIN CITY, and know which after only five minutes of screen time.  It is exceedingly brutal and nasty, but also has towering production design, stunning visual effects, and unusual characters.  It is the kind of movie that Leonard Maltin can hate, while Ebert & Roeper can give "Two Thumbs Way Up" to.  When it opened, the SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE's Mick La Salle gave it ****.  If you like the Frank Miller comic books, you will probably find it a masterpiece.  On a too short behind-the-scenes documentary on the DVD, Miller says he is floored by how faithful Rodriguez is to the source.  That is why Rodriguez brought him on board as co-director, which cost Rodriguez his membership in the Directors Guild.  Things must have deteriorated inside the DGA since Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly co-directed ON THE TOWN (1949) and SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (1952).  (Reviewed from widescreen DVD, and rated "R" for sexual material and brutal violence.  It is for adults only.)</p></body></html>

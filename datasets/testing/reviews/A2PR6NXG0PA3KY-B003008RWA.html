<meta name="summary" content="Sickening!"></head><body><p>This isn't a five-star film. It's spotty, sloppy, and self-indulgent, more a diatribe than a documentary. My five-star rating is a vote of solidarity with Michael Moore's position: that American health care as a system is inadequate and unworthy of a modern nation. Moore is a 'muckraker' in the honorable tradition of American journalism, and there's plenty of 'muck' to be raked in America, the only wealthy Western democracy that doesn't support a system of universal health care. Moore's targets are the profit-driven insurance companies - HMOs chiefly - the greedy drug companies, and the special-interest 'bagmen' in Congress, from both parties, who collaborate in keeping American health care expensive and inequitable. America and the American people spend more money, both in aggregate and per capita, on health care than any other nation, yet America lags in most statistics of health care quality, and that's a sickening state of affairs.<br /><br />However, what's "sickening" about Sicko is that it won't persuade those people who have virulently resisted health care reform in the USA. Those who already recognize the failures of for-profit, insurance-dominated health care will applaud Moore's witty cinematography, but those who deny that the system needs reform will latch onto Moore's personal idiosyncrasies and partialities as evidence that health care reform is a big-government intrusion and a socialist plot against Mom and Apple Pie.<br /><br />Some Americans enjoy very good health care. I do, when I happen to be in the USA. I have Kaiser Permanente coverage, which has been fully adequate to cover two very expensive procedures for me, but Kaiser Permanente is one of the villains in this film. Yes, Kaiser and other HMOs are guilty of the misdeeds Moore exposes, but his depiction of them is too one-sided, too selective. Anyone who has had good experiences with Kaiser, as I have, will be skeptical of Moore's integrity. That's 'sickening' because Moore is basically correct. Insurance-managed health care is unfair, capricious, supremely inflationary, and above all UNAVAILABLE for millions of people. The Constitution of the USA pledges the federal government to "promote the general welfare" of the People, a commitment to a sense of community that is not fulfilled by a system of health care that excludes the poorest and sickest.<br /><br />Moore is also too one-sided in his portrayal of the universal health care systems of other countries, particularly of Canada, France, and Cuba. It is true that those countries provide free or nearly free health care to everybody, despite any 'pre-existing conditions' and despite the disqualification of poverty. It's true that citizens of those countries enjoy a sense of security that many Americans lack. It's true that statistics demonstrate better results - lower infant mortality, greater longevity, better overall health - in those countries than in the opulent USA. But it's also true that the national health care systems of Canada and Europe are far from perfect. There are long waits for procedures, MRIs for instance, in Canada. There are complaints, angry complaints about health care in Germany and England -- as there are of course in Massachusetts and Hawaii -- but Michael Moore doesn't report those complaints. His one-sidedness weakens his case.<br /><br />I've experienced health care needs abroad, by the way, for myself in Spain and Germany, for my family in France and Canada. I've gotten effective, prompt, courteous treatment of urgent medical problems like strep throat in Spain, with no paperwork and no hassle. My family has gotten house calls from doctors in France, as Moore depicts. The right wing insurance-industry propaganda against 'socialized' health care in Europe is just as deceptive and unscrupulous as Moore declares. National Health Care is effective and economical in ways that profit-driven health care can't duplicate. I only wish Michael Moore could have made a more convincing case for it.<br /><br />Ex-Vice President Dick Cheney famously accused Michael Moore, at the Republican Convention in 2004, of being disingenuous. That might seem like 'the pot calling the kettle black' since Cheney has been proven to be a consummate opportunist of disinformation. But it's also inaccurate. Moore is anything but disingenuous; his positions and his intentions are always blatantly clear. In this film, when he briefly poses as the Devil's Advocate for American health care, he's utterly unconvincing. He can direct, but he can't act. His ingenuousness is painful at times; for instance, he delivers one of his strongest endorsements of socialized medicine -- yes, he IS a socialist! -- with a bust of Karl Marx visible behind him. What's disingenuous about that? Unfortunately, many 'conservative' Americans will react to such deliberate honesty as mere provocation. Moore would do better not to taunt his adversaries, assuming that his goal is to persuade them.<br /><br />But then, is the goal of Sicko really to persuade or to entertain? In the end, it fails of one and succeeds at the other.</p></body></html>

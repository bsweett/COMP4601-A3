<meta name="summary" content="The best movie of 2006!"></head><body><p>IN 1944 Spain during the Spanish civil war, a young girl named Ofelia has always been a daydreamer and obsessed with fairy tales for has to live in the countryside with her pregnant mother at a farmhouse. One night, she finds a fairy that leads her to the labyrinth outside where she meets a faun creature that tells her that she is a lost princess and must do three important tasks in order to return to the kingdom and escape the horrors of war.<br /><br />Spectacular and unique adult horror fantasy from Spain/Mexico that is perhaps the best modern fairy tale there might be! Not since "The Wizard of Oz" or "Lord of the Ring" has there ever been an imaginative fairy tale that captures the audiences imagination. Guillermo Del Toro (Director of "Hellboy", "Devil's Backbone", "Cronos" and "Blade 2") brings a thrilling, powerful and sometimes macabre story that blends the horrors of war with the fantasy innocence of youth. This is one of the best foreign movies i've ever seen and one of the best horror & fantasy movies i've ever seen.<br /><br />This 2-Disc special edition contains excellent extras like audio commentary, an introduction, Teaser & Trailer, Poster gallery, three outstanding featurettes, "The Charlie Rose Show" with the filmakers being interviwed, Three interactive DVD comics that tell the stories of the creatures in the movie, Director's Notebook which are interactive menu page acess video pods that features interviews with Del Toro, Multi-Angel Storyboards and Thumbnail Compares, VFX Plate Compare and Galleries.<br /><br />A must have DVD for fans of fantasy, horror and cinema itself and a true triumph.</p></body></html>

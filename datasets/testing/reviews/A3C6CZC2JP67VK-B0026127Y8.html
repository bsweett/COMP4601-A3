<meta name="summary" content="Action film that goes back old school"></head><body><p>While watching "Taken" I was reminded of several other "Lost Child" films and surprisingly the one which first came to mind was Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Commando." Specifically this movie is what that movie should have been like. Liam Neeson outshines Arnold with a witty and far more sympathetic and charismatic character portrayal.<br /><br />The film's plot is simple but has enough twists and texture to make it into a fulfilling experience. I could go on and on talking about Neeson but I want to say a few things about this movie. Following path of revenge Besson takes us on a ride that is full of action and the whole story is told in beautiful simplicity. It doesn't present nothing new, but the way the whole movie was filmed, with amazing action scenes (some of them brutal like electricity torture) and great actor in main role, you gotta' be satisfied with final outcome. The film takes many turns and even goes on the verge of moral ambiguity but Neeson's charisma pulls the film through even its more preposterous segments.<br /><br />And yes, you know that he's going to save everyone but then again Seagal also saves everyone but 95% of his movies are sort of dense. That is the magic of this movie cause Besson didn't present anything new. You just need to have passable script, good, young director, be European and have good actor in main role. All I can say is that you will still be taken by Liam Neeson!</p></body></html>

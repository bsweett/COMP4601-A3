Desperate and lonely, she meets a young lesbian named Selby and the two become inseparable.  They need money to start a new life together, so Lee does the only work she knows, only now she uses a gun.<br /><br />This true story of a woman who killed seven men for their money and cars  is extremely brutal and depressing.  Theron is unrecognizable as the hardened killer and gives a heartbreaking and unforgettable performance.  The film doesn't excuse her behavior, it explains it; the result is a movie that is shocking and yet brought tears to my eyes.  This is a woman who had no one to help her, no place to go, and she survived day-to-day by taking what she needed.  Christina Ricci is also very good playing Lee's naive and dependent girlfriend, Selby.<br /><br />This frightening portrait of a lost soul has so much ugliness that I had to fast-forward past a few scenes.  The acting is top-notch, however, and Theron rightly won the Oscar for Best Actress.  A sad and unforgettable movie.</p></body></html>

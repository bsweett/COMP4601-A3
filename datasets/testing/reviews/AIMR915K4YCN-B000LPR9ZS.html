<meta name="summary" content="AMANDA RISING..."></head><body><p>SAW III takes us deeper into the mind of Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) while upping the ante in the suffering / teaching department. Amanda (the most excellent Shawnee Smith) takes her place at Jigsaw's side, acting as his novitiate instrument of higher education. Many surprises are in store, as we are led through another of the Jigmeister's dark labyrinths. This time, his students will learn the futility of hateful revenge and the value of forgiveness. SAW III is a gruesome masterpiece of bloody horror, a puzzlebox full of razors. Possibly the best of the bunch (as of this writing SAW VI is in production). Enjoy, but beware of rancid pig carcasses...</p></body></html>

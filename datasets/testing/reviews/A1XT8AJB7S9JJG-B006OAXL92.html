<meta name="summary" content="A very well done & entertaining movie that won't appeal to everyone. A lot is happening throughout but doesn't feel like it. B+"></head><body><p>"Do you ever wonder where your dreams come from? Look around, this is where they are made."  Hugo Caberet spends his days winding clocks and searching for parts for his auto-man.  After running into shop owner George Melies (Kingsley) and his daughter he is forced to reveal his secret to them, which sets off a chain of event that changes him and the city.  I have to start by saying that this is not a movie for everyone. I really liked it but it is very slow moving and for the casual movie watcher it may seem like nothing happened.  That statement may seem strange but after you watch it it will make sense to you. This is a movie that each scene builds on the next (like most Scorses's) and is hard to talk about without giving anything away but I will say that it is a movie that entertained me all the way through.  I can see why the movie is up for 11 Oscars, but I will be surprised if it wins any of the major ones. Overall, a movie I really enjoyed, but again not for everyone. I give it a B+.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The real bastard is SS Hans Landa"></head><body><p>The opening scene in this movie was brilliant and must not be missed.<br />The story is about a Jewish girl who escapes the Germans as they massacre her family.<br />The movie is a fictionalized version of what could have happened had a Jewish army unit had entered France with the sole intent of killing as many Nazis as possible and finally succeeding in ending the war, when they end up blowing up a theater, which is now owned by the Jewish girl who had escaped, in which the entire top leadership of the Third Reich has assembled to watch a propaganda film.<br />The film, although long is laid out in easy chapters like a book. Tarantino uses wonderful and complex dialogue to guide the film. I loved the exchange of words in the first scene between the French farmer and the Nazi officer SS Hans Landa ( Christoph Waltz) .The action is minimal but at times is very gruesome and bloody. The costumes are splendid and the locations are spectacular as well. Brad Pitt plays his part well and is ably supported by all the basterds. Mike Myers is in a tiny role as a British officer and I feel that he was wasted.<br />I felt that the highlights of the film were the opening scene, the shootout at the tavern, and the wonderful just ending. If I were to watch the film in a movie theater it would be to see Christoph Waltz who is simply brilliant as the shrewd, chilling, sinister, opportunist and always on the alert SS officer Hans Landa. I had never seen him perform before but this could easily be the best portrayal of evil in recent times. He alone is the worth the price of the ticket and popcorn and cannot imagine this movie without him in it. I liked the movie and I gave it four stars. 3/28/10</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Will the real Sam Bell please stand up?"></head><body><p>Director Duncan Jones pays homage to previous science fiction classics such as 2001, Silent Running, Outland and Alien, and does so from the same type of "grown up" science fiction perspective. His first film, Moon, does just that, offering a psychological edginess to one man's experience out in space. In the film, Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is completing a three year contract for Lunar Industries, where he lives on the moon and collects samples of helium3, a source of energy. He has virtually no contact with humans other than via video messages from his wife; GERTY (Kevin Spacey), a robot, is his only companion during this time. Sam feels a sense of cabin fever and claustrophobia as the time winds down, and begins having strange hallucinations as his time is almost up. While exploring out on the moon, he has an accident. The aftermath of the accident is where the film gets tricky. He wakes up in the infirmary talking with GERTY, but sees what appears to be another version of himself in the room. Realizing that he is not hallucinating this time, Sam begins to uncover secrets about Lunar Industries and events back home.<br /><br />Some may take Moon to be standard sci-fi fare, but I think Moon has its own approach to understanding the effects of isolation on an individual, and what it means to be human, and develops its own answers for these issues. Sam's searching for answers out in space involve being exposed to emotionally-draining truths and revelations. Moon is an intelligent, thought-provoking movie that you can step back after watching and reflect upon. At points, the film investigates the claustrophobic feeling of not only being "closed in" and isolated from society, but from doubting one's own identity or where one is at in the universe, spiritually, psychologically, or physically. An unsettling perspective is realized throughout Sam's point of view, and Sam Rockwell does a superb job of capturing a wide range of emotions: anger, frustration, despair, paranoia, sadness, hope. The ending might not be awe-dropping, but Moon is a solid, smart sci-fi that makes you think about the essence of technology and its place, and what measures we should or shouldn't take in gaining knowledge.<br /><br />The extras from the DVD are exceptional. There is a commentary with Duncan Jones as well as The Making of Moon, which sheds some light on the basis for the story as well as the effects. I particularly enjoyed the Q and A session with Duncan Jones at the screening in Houston. Hearing the direction for the film, and the inspiration for it, gives you a better perspective for what the film was trying to achieve.<br /><br />Over all, Moon is a great addition to the sci-fi film genre.</p></body></html>

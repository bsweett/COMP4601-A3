It made me ask questions as I watched, questions about what it means 'to be someone', what it is she actually hoped to be, and how she thought moving to Paris would help her realize that.  The desire to 'come alive' is often achieved through travel or a drastic change of some kind and I can fully understand wanting to escape the suburbs and the hometown - so on one level I could relate. Not to mention that divorce and abortion were were both taboo in the 50s (when the movie seems to be taking place). It becomes a chessboard of tangled issues developing and playing against each other as the story progresses.<br /><br />DiCaprio and Winslett did a good job acting in this as well and their dialogues pulled me in.  DiCaprio is sometimes hit and miss for me.  I liked him in "Catch Me If You Can", another 50's piece, and in this one I also found him more or less sympathetic (and fairly believable).  The character of the insane/truth-telling son of the housing agent was an added plus and helped really bring out the issues in the film.  It ended nicely too I thought and left me pensive.  I don't think this movie is simply about agreeing or disagreeing with the course the characters take (although that is inevitable) but rather seeing the very familiar attitudes and needs which spurn them on on their way.  The extremity to which she takes things is what makes you really think about it and (probably) come to your own more healthy conclusions.</p></body></html>

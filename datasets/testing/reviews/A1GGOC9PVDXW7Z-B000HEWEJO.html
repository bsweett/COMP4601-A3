A budget-priced item that comes in an oversized cardboard box with tucked-in flaps at top and bottom, it's a slow speed transfer of only middling quality. There's no HiFi audio track, only a linear one. The film itself is unrestored and has a less than pristine picture.<br /><br />Although now a perennial holiday favorite, in first run "Wonderful Life" failed to earn back its $3.7 million cost.<br /><br />Shortly after its release, the FBI cited this movie's anti-banker plotline as a common ploy used by Communists. There may be some truth here, for the story was partly scripted by Dalton Trumbo, playwright Clifford Odets and poet/critic Dorothy Parker. All three were investigated for possible Communist activities. Trumbo and Parker were both blacklisted. Odets avoided the same fate by cooperatively naming his "fellow travelers."<br /><br />SYNOPSIS--<br />After a large sum of his customers' money is inadvertantly lost, businessman George Bailey (Stewart) attempts suicide by jumping off a bridge into an icy river. He's rescued by an angel named Clarence (Travers). In a clever variation of Dickens' Christmas spirits visiting Scrooge, Clarence shows the despairing man how the townspeople of Bedford Falls would be far worse off if George Bailey never existed.<br /><br />"It's a Wonderful Life" is also available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VDDDVO">DVD</a>. (Includes the colorized version.)<br /><br />Related item:<br />A year after this picture, Cary Grant, Loretta Young and David Niven starred in THE BISHOP'S WIFE. Here, Grant is angel Dudley, come to help Bishop Brougham and his wife Julia. Unlike Capra's often dark tale, this one's consistently light and charming. One of Cary Grant's best movies.

<meta name="summary" content="For Once, Lex Luthor Saves the Day"></head><body><p>Giving you a brief rundown of where I stand, I thought the 1st "Superman" was ok. I actually enjoyed Part 2 better; part 3 was my favorite; and even though part 4 got a lot of harsh criticism, I didn't think it was so bad. I kind of liked it.<br /><br />Onto the subject at hand. I understand that this movie was an uphill battle at best and a doomed failure at worst. I understand that most people already had the irrevocable image of Christopher Reeve as Superman. But this already difficult battle was not handled well.<br /><br />For one thing, this movie tries to be consistent with Part 1 and 2. (It shows images of Marlon Brando from Part 1, and having Lex Luthor know about Superman's base from Part 2.) BUT, this movie seems to forget that the death of Superman's 'earth' mother was mentioned in Part 3, and that Superman made arrangements to sell the family farm in Part 4.<br /><br />The main problem here is that the movie does NOT remain consistent with the 1st 4; NOR DOES IT MAKE A CLEAN BREAK AND START FRESH. (Making a clean break and starting fresh was probably the best bet for this difficult uphill battle.)<br /><br />Moving on, it almost gets annoying when it at least seems that Rooth is imitating Christopher Reeve. He may have been better off just bringing his own style to the role. Something like this happened recently.<br /><br />After 2 Harry Potter movies, Richard Harris (who did Dumbledore) died. He was beloved in this final role. Now when Sir Michael Gambon took the role from part 3, he was smart enough not to imitate Richard Harris. He knew this was a difficult spot. So he just did Dumbledore with his own style. (Probably Sir Michael Gambon's smartest move under the circumstances.)<br /><br />Well, back to Superman. His jealousy over Lois Lane having moved on with her life seems a bit unfair. (He did after all leave for some years.) Lois Lane did the healthy thing. She moved on with her life. (She also has a son now.)<br /><br />What saves this movie from being a complete and utter disaster is Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. He has gotten out of jail and now has the family fortune to start new with. He is very bad. But like many of Charles Dickens's villains, he carries a charm that makes him likable in a way. His big plan is to use Kryptonic elements to create a new world, and take over.<br /><br />There is an interesting climactic moment where Lex Luthor leads Superman into a trap, and it's hard not to enjoy seeing Lex Luthor finally get his chance to punch out Superman.<br /><br />Another character worth mentioning is Frank Langella as Mr. White. In his minor (but still significant) role, he adds a bit of charm. Lois is starting to feel bad about her book: "Why the World Does Not Need Superman." And with some charm, Frank Langella says: "Don't worry Lois. People won't remember what you got the Pulitzer Prize for. They will just remember that you got it."<br /><br />Believe me, I TRIED to be open to this film. I TRIED to give it a fair chance. I TRIED to understand that Brandon Routh had a very difficult if not impossible task. But it just didn't work. I give the movie 1 star for Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, and 1 star for Frank Langella. Another annoying element is that if the movie takes place some years after Part 2, why do the characters look younger than they did in Part 2?<br /><br />SUMMED UP: They had a choice. They could have either remained consistent with the 4 Christopher Reeve movies, or they could have made a clean break and started fresh. AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DID NEITHER.<br /><br />Being perfectly honest, if you have not seen the 4 Christopher Reeve movies, you may be more able to accept this and enjoy it on its own. But it really doesn't fit with the Christopher Reeve movies.</p></body></html>

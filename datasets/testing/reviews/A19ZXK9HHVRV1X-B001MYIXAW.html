If you answered "Twilight," then you haven't seen "Let the Right One In," a Swedish horror movie with an art-house sheen.<br /><br />Oskar (the excellent Kare Hedebrant) is the twelve-year-old schoolboy who's the perpetual target of a trio of bullies; Eli (the equally fine Lina Leandersson) is the fetching young vampire who moves into the apartment next door.  Together, these two social outcasts form a powerful emotional bond, with Eli hiding the truth about herself from Oskar till the point where she no longer can.<br /><br />Written by John Ajvide Lindqvist (who adapted his own novel) and directed by Tomas Alfredson, "Let the Right One In" is less concerned with the blood-and-guts aspects of the scenario than with the pain and remorse each of the main characters experiences throughout the course of the drama.  Though obviously craving a "normal" life, Eli is hopelessly trapped by her own nature, forced to endure a life of loneliness and killing simply to survive in the world.  Oskar is equally alone, though for more prosaic reasons.  In addition to the constant bullying, Oskar is a product of a broken home, and like Eli, he too may finally have to resort to violence to ensure his existence.  Then there's Eli's father who numbly and methodically performs the gruesome bloodletting rituals he knows he must if his daughter is to survive.<br /><br />There's a genuine poignancy in the fact that Eli knows that she can never give herself fully to Oskar for fear of consigning him to the same murderous fate she herself must endure.  A similar sense of twisted pathos pervades Eli's relationship with her father, who carries paternalistic duty to a whole new, genuinely disturbing level.<br /><br />All of this is played out against stark, sparsely-furnished, minimalist settings that provide an appropriately atmospheric backdrop for the story being told.<br /><br />As "art" horror films go, this one is not quite as bone-chilling or as memorable as the truly diabolical "Funny Games," but it still provides a welcome respite from all those inane, studio-manufactured products we're forced to endure on a regular basis when Hollywood sets its sights on terror.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ridley Scott + Sci Fi = Excellent"></head><body><p>This is perhaps one of the best Sci-Fi films ever made. The level of detail in this film is amazing, a bounty for the eyes. Ridley Scott created a &quot;real&quot; environment in this film, a place where one could see people living and working. Giger's alien was the most original one in film history. Although not original, the story cotained enough thrills and chills to keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Great movie!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Alice--Is it really you???"></head><body><p>I really enjoyed it!  There were all ages at the theater.  It was a very nicely put together combination of people and creatures. (I think you call it animatronics?)  While I remember the basic Alice story from years ago, I don't necessarily remember all the fine details to compare it to the original.<br /><br />The story begins with several businessmen discussing possible ventures when little Alice comes downstairs.  Daddy says, "Another nightmare?"  Alice affirms and daddy takes her back upstairs and tucks her back into bed after another dream of strange creatures with funny names.<br /><br />Fast forward 13 years.  Alice and Mom are traveling through the English Countryside.  Daddy has passed on to "the other side".  They are going to visit one of the business partners who also bought Daddy's share of the business.  Arriving at the partner's beautiful English country estate, Alice is paired up with their son Hamish and soon finds out that Hamish will ask for her hand.  Now, let me side step here for a minute.  Alice doesn't exactly seem all that thrilled with Hamish but he is breathing without assistance and the family has money.  Well-meaning relatives quickly point out, "Your face won't last forever," which translates to "you had better grab some guy before you get ugly and nuts like Aunt xxxx."<br /><br />While all this dialog business is going on, Alice keeps seeing a white rabbit in a topcoat with a stop watch. Hmmmm.  Finally, Hamish asks for Alice's hand in front of the whole gathering but she hesitates.  Thinking, "Do I REALLY wanna do this?" she spots the white rabbit again.  He is pointing to his stopwatch, indicating there is not much time left.  Alice excuses herself and runs off to follow the rabbit that no one sees but her.<br /><br />Alice soon falls down a hole. Down, down, down - landing in a locked circular room.  The key on the table isn't helping because it only unlocks a small doggie-sized door.  She finds some potion to drink that makes her small, and a cake to eat that makes her big.  You hear a male and female voice talking in the background saying, "You'd think she'd remember all this from the first time."  She gets through the door and finds herself in a strange garden where a blue caterpillar is smoking a hooka pipe.  He is the "wisdom" guy.  As Alice meets the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, and other characters, there is discussion as to whether or not she is the RIGHT Alice.  A  mean-looking polar bear type creature chases her and her friends, as does a mean buzzard.  The mean creatures all belong to the Red Queen, as does the  "Jabberberrywalkie" (a dragon).  The Queen likes to behead anything and anyone who displeases her.  She has a frog beheaded for eating her fruit tart.  Every other word out of her mouth is "off with his/her head!"  (Fortunately, you don't see them beheaded.)<br /><br />Once upon a time, the land was beautiful, but the Red Queen, her warriors, and the mean creatures raged war and the dragon fried what was left of the land.  The "prophecy" was that Alice would return and slay the dragon, but this Alice is a peace-nic.<br /><br />We also meet the White Queen, who is the nice one.  Alice is actually supposed to steal this special sword, return it to the White Queen, become her Champion in the battle against the Red Queen, and then slay the dragon.  Oh, BTW, the Queens are sisters.<br /><br />I found the movie quite enjoyable.  Johnny Depp was absolutely wonderful, as always.  It amazes me how he made his character come alive!  He is very talented and was the real star of the movie.<br /><br />This is a nice story about facing fears, transformation, friendship, and about a young woman who is stronger than she thought she was.  There is also an underlying message to Alice that she is not a girl who has to take the first guy who comes along, especially when she has no special feelings for him.<br /><br />END OF REVIEW<br />_______________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Do not read my last paragraph below unless you want to know if your children should see the show.<br />______________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Is it for young children?  I think it's iffy.  This is not really a children's movie anyway.  It is an adaptation of one for adults. It's not bad, but you do have the concept of beheading people/charachters and the dragon shooting out fire.  You also have the 2 monsters, one getting his eye plucked out with a sword.  You see an almost beheading of a person and a monster gets his head chopped off.  It might give your children nightmares, so, be careful.  They may not be as unaffected as you think.  I say this because I made the same mistake with my son.  He told me about how it affected him many years later. That was when I found out I wasn't as smart as I thought I was.</p></body></html>

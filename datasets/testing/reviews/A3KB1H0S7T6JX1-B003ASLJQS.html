<meta name="summary" content="A movie worth watching!"></head><body><p>Mystic River, brings to the screen the story of three old friends who reunite years after a traumatic experience made them drift apart.  The circumstances under which they meet again are not the best and their old friendship will soon be put to the test...<br /><br />To a certain extent Mystic River bring to mind Sleepers (also starring Kevin Bacon, but in a much different role).<br /><br />Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins, Laurence Fishburn, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are extraordinary to say the least!  The actors give it their 100% and it really shows!<br /><br />The only setback is in relation to Tom Guiry who as Brendan Harris is not really convincing in his role as Katie's boyfriend (He does not seem to be "all man" if you catch my drift...).<br /><br />Aside from that, the plot and the setting, are both excellent!  In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.<br /><br />Overall, Mystic River is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment.</p></body></html>

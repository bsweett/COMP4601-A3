<meta name="summary" content="True-crime-tale paints a great portrait of the 70's while telling multiple tales of those obsessed by the long cold case."></head><body><p>Based on Graysmiths novels Zodiac tells the story of the press-obsessed self-proclaimed "Zodiac Killer." Zodiac isn't just the story of the hunt for the killer, but an exploration of many characters obsessed and/or involved with the long cold case: Cartoonist turned-writer-detective Robert Graysmith is played with quirky excellence by Jake Gyllenhaal; Robert Downey Jr. is brillant as the self-absorbed strung-out reporter Paul Avery who tries help crack the Zodiac's code, Mark Ruffalo plays Detective Dave Toschi ( the inspiration for Steve McQueen)seek out the identity of the killer along with his partner played by Anthony Edwards.<br /><br />The movie doesn't just focus on the killer, or even the search for him, but the details of period, and their lives. Like UK TV series "Life on Mars" the stark difference between present-day police procedure and the 70's. This is defined neatly by a scene in which Edwards character struggles to coordinate their efforts with other law enforcement districts. Also the obsession nearly causes Graysmith to lose his family.<br /><br />I don't usually go for the "based on a true-story" type of movie or crime dramas based on actual events, but I thought this one was superb. I enjoyed seeing some of the disconnected details tie together, like the Dirty Harry homage as the real players are invited to a special San Fran's Finest screening.</p></body></html>

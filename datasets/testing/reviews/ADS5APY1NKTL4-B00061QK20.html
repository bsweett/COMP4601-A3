The use of color and camera tricks is fabulous, and, the use of color to depict moods and set the atmosphere, is eye popping.  This really was reminiscent of Chinese hand painted screens, for me.  Some people have compared the retelling of the story (from three different perspectives) as similar to the approach of RASHOMAN (directed by Akira Kurosawa).  The question that remains for us is whether "Nameless" (Jet Li) is a ruthless murderer or a fearless warrior who has taken a stand for those castaways from the lower rungs of society.  The supporting cast is equally intriguing in their roles, and, the lines between good and evil become increasingly blurred through character examination and the reallignment of the angles of human manipulation. The story is as much psychological as it is action-packed.  I'm only sorry that I waited too long and only saw it on DVD.  This is one of those films that comes alive more on the big screen.  Director Zhang Yimou did a fantastic job and I am sure that this film will be honored for years to come.</p></body></html>

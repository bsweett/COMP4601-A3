<meta name="summary" content="The Scariest Friday the 13th"></head><body><p>I'm a big fan of the first three, bu by part 4 it gets old. The first three have a good atmosphere, exceptional acting for a low-budget film, and while not as scary as Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, this still is a great movie, and it tries not to take itself too seriously. The rest are just entertaining, but this is the one that started it all, and I wish people would stop giving these films such a hard time. WATCH IT ALONE IN THE DARK, and have a wonderful time.</p></body></html>

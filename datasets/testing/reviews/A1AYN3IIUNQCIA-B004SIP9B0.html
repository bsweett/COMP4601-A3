<meta name="summary" content="all hail The Queen"></head><body><p>2006 will always be remembered as Helen Mirren's year. after years of being under the radar in great shows like Prime Suspect and movies like The Madness of King George and Gosford Park, Mirren finally roared onto the spot light not only playing one Queen Elizabeth but TWO Queen Elizabeths. first, she scored by playing the original Queen Elizabth in HBO's Elizabth 1 and then she scored again by playing Queen Elizabth 2 in this film, The Queen. the film follows the week after the terrible death of Princess Diana and the seemingly cold response the royal family gives to the death. through it all, Elizabeth 2 keeps her compsure not to buckle under the command while the Prime Minister grows restless over it all. some people have complained that the Queen is one big bore and i have to dissagree, i felt this movie was incredibally great and fully kept me engrossed in the picture. but the real reason i loved the film was Helen, she absolutly radiats as our conflicted queen, not only from the appearence but from her facial expressions, speech, and at just the right moment a bit of compassion. She definently deserved the Oscar, no doubt about it and hopefully now she will finally be reconized for her outstanding talent. to quote from Helen's Oscar speech "Ladies and gentlemen, i give you the queen!"</p></body></html>

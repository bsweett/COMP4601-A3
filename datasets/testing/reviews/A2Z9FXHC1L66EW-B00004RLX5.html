W/Original Crew!"></head><body><p>Let me begin by stating that Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home was the first S.T. film I saw in the movie theaters.  This wasn't by choice, however.  When Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan came out in theaters I was only seven  years old and my dad said it was too violent for me to see (I know! ).  Sadly the DVD version is the first time I ever saw it in the widescreen  format. Before that it was always the pan an scan video with the cool boxed  pictures of the film as the cover art.  I have read many reviews about both  films and there seems to be a huge debate over which of these excellent  films is the best Trek of all.  I really like them both immensely and even  though, to me, it feels like Part II has the majority vote I must go with  the minority and say that Part IV is the best.  Again, please understand  that doesn't mean that II is not wonderful.  It is.  I'd give it 4 and a  half out of 5 stars.  But IV gets all 5.  Maybe it is because it was the  first one I saw on the big screen.  There was a great atmosphere and the  place was packed.  In fact everytime I go see a S.T. film there's this bond  I feel with the other audience members that you don't feel when you see  most films.  Every punchline got huge laughs.  It was like we were all  friends.  I have always enjoyed the lighter side of Star Trek.  The Trouble  With Tribbles comes to mind immediately.  It was so funny making a little  furry round animal into this menace that constantly multiply when given  food.  Why should you always have to take yourself seriously?  In fact  that's one reason why I watch Part IV more often than II...it's more  relaxing. And I mean that in a good way.  Nobody dies in this movie, unlike  Part II where many people are killed.  Don't get me wrong.  I love action  and sci-fi put together (The Matrix)but they really do suck the energy  right out of you.  The concept of an alien probe coming to earth seeking to  communicate with humpback whales but to no avail since they've assumedly  been extinct and in the process knocking out all main power to anything it  comes in contact with may seem outrageous to some.  I think it was a nice  way of saying if we don't stop killing off species one day it's gonna come  back and bite us in the butt.  Leonard Nimoy called it an &quot;Ecological  house of cards&quot; in the director featurette on the DVD.  One day we  could pull a keystone card and the whole house will fall down.  The whales  by the way looked incredible.  Until I got the DVD I had no idea that only  5% of the whale shots were real and the rest weren't.  The dialogue with  the cast is terrific and I really enjoyed the fact that Spock wasn't fully  himself and that he still needed time to find out who he was and how he  felt.  You could sense that with his attempted use of &quot;colorful  metaphors&quot; and such.  Oh and that crowd cheered forever when he gave  that punk on the bus the Vulcan neck pinch for playing his radio loudly.  In this film Kirk got to be Mr. Romantic again, the way many remember him  from the television series.  Charming, witty but a bit clueless at times  (L.D.S.?).  The dinner scene was his best as he's trying to persuade  Gillian to give him the whale's as his communicator goes off and he tells  Scottie to tell Uhura and Chekov &quot;Phaser's on stun, good luck, Kirk  out&quot; with this goofy look of embarrassment on his face that works so  well.  Everyone has an important task to finish: McCoy and Scottie getting  the glass walls to hold the whales in and paying for them by giving the  owner info on transparant alumminum (&quot;Is it worth somethin' to ya or  should I just punch up clear?&quot;), Sulu must get a helicopter to  transport the walls (I still wonder how he stole it...perhaps he put his  communicator inside when he was talking to that guy and they beamed it  somewhere else later..who knows..it doesn't matter), and Uhura and Chekov  have to get energy to recharge the Klingon dillithium crystals by stealing  them from a nuclear &quot;wessel&quot; called, oddly enough, the  Enterprise.  Chekov's interrogation scene is hilarious.  Not a single  weapon is fired with the exception of a harpoon which gets deflected by the  Bird of Prey.  The rescue of Chekov gives McCoy his best scenes, giving a  woman a pill that grows her a new kidney and mixing words with 20th century  doctors (&quot;We're dealing with medievalism here&quot;) and the way in  which they escape the hospital was outstanding (I love the frantic pace).  After the whales are saved and beamed up it's another sling shot around the  sun (anyone remember when they first tried it on TV in the episode  &quot;Tomorrow Is Yesterday&quot;)?  As you can tell I love this film.  I  only wish they had done another like this with the original crew.  I know  the majority will still say Star Trek II, which by the way has one major  flaw in that Khan could not have recognized Chekov (he was not yet a member  of the Enterprise crew during Episode #24, Space Seed, which I like to  watch before putting in Part II. Chekov's first appearence was Episode #30,  Catspaw (The Star Trek Encyclopedia))is the best film. But for me Star Trek  IV: The Voyage Home stands tallest in the end.</p></body></html>

Why do I think this is a notable accomplishment?  Because I think you have to really care about the characters to reach that point.  When outrageous things happen to characters you don't care much about...you'll just laugh.  And if the circumstances are too horrific, and you care about the characters, you'll cry.  This movie walks the line, and that isn't easy.<br /><br />LMS is about a fairly typical "indie-movie-dysfunctional family."  A loser father who tries to teach empowerment workshops (Greg Kinear), his wife (Toni Collette) who is the closest thing to a voice of reason, their young daughter (Abigail Breslin, who is a finalist in a young-girl's beauty pageant...but has no business being).  There's also Collette's longer teenage son (who has taken a vow of silence...THAT'S something we've never seen a teen do in the movies!!!) And Colette's suicidal gay brother who is Proust scholar (Steve Carell).  Rounding out the group is Kinear's cantankerous old father (Alan Arkin), who has been kicked out of his retirement community for doing drugs.  So, the movie loses some points for lack of an original group of characters. Indie movies are alway SO interested in quirky people...but after two decades of post-Sex, Lies & Videotape independence...we've seen all the "new" archetypes before.<br /><br />The movie is about the family's eventful roadtrip from Albuquerque (my home town and current residence) to SoCal for the contest...and then the contest itself.  The trip is undertaken in an old VW bus, which early on, loses its clutch, and can thus only run in 3rd and 4th gear.  This leads to some very amusing and somehow touching moments with all these characters push-starting the car and then one by one, leaping into the open door!  This is creative (and very believable if you've ever owned a VW!).<br /><br />Most of the film chronicles the journey, which includes moments both ridiculous and sad (as I said above).  Plans go awry.  You can feel the sweat of impending despair.  Then, they arrive, and the contest itself is almost like another movie.  It becomes as much a comment on the beauty pageant industry as anything else.  This part, while amusing, deflates some of the power the film was building towards...and the "climactic" scene wants to be sublime, but is only mildly pleasing.  We've had our tone jarred too much.<br /><br />I don't want you to think I didn't like the film.  Most of it is excellent, primarily because of the outstanding performances.  Alan Arkin is always great (in my opinion, he's the single greatest film actor never to win an Oscar...I will pretty much see anything he's in.)  Greg Kinear, doing another take on his "decent loser" is in fine form.  His character generates equal amounts of pity and frustration...and that's exactly what it should do!  Toni Collette is another performer who can seemingly do no wrong...including one of the most convincing American accents ever done by an Australian.  She is simply a terrific actress.  Steve Carell steals the show in many ways.  His character undergoes the most growth, and in some ways, the most pain.  Yet Carell hardly changes expressions.  (Although I must say that when Carell smiles, he has a wonderful, glowing, innocent smile that cannot help but make you feel better.)  His performance is very internal, deep, and best of all...really, really funny.  He's so different here than in THE OFFICE, or BRUCE ALMIGHTY.  If anyone thought his string of success is a fluke...think again...this guy is the real deal.<br /><br />So I heartily recommend the film for its richness (even when it descends into cliche...it's heartfelt) and the great acting.  Frankly, that's enough right there.  It is R-rated for some obscene rants by the grandfather...but for all that, it feels strangely innocent.<br /><br />And for natives of Albuquerque...none of the film was shot in New Mexico, and it shows.  Even the interior shots don't "feel" like a house you would see in Albuquerque.  This doesn't detract from the film at all...I'm just mentioning it.</p></body></html>

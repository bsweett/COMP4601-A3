<meta name="summary" content="Not just another revenge movie, MOF has a beautiful twist..."></head><body><p>Revenge movies are so popular because we all like to feel that warm fuzzy of satisfaction when the guilty reprobate responsible for causing all that pain to our hero is finally blown up into tiny bloody pieces.  It's a comfortable feeling of validation that makes us glow with a delightful feeling of righteous fulfillment.  Right?<br /><br />Man On Fire is not necessarily a great movie, but it is a great revenge movie, unique in its choice of location, actors, and resolution; and that makes it worthy of a peek.<br /><br />Denzel Washington plays John W. Creasy, an ex-assassin from some sort of special ops group, who has retired from his work with Death to become an aimless and hopeless alcoholic.  He travels to Mexico City to visit his old friend Paul Rayburn (Christopher Walken) who has settled into a comfortable life there.<br /><br />Rayburn sets Creasy up with an easy job as a bodyguard to nine-year old Pita Ramos (expertly played by young Dakota Fanniing) daughter of well-off plant owner Samuel Ramos.  Creasy does not like people, but young Pita manages to wiggle her way into his heart.  Creasy is almost killed when she is kidnapped for ransom, and finds out through Rayburn that the ransom drop went bad.  Creasy then teams up with tenacious and levelheaded reporter Mariana Guerrero (talented Rachel Ticotin) and sets out to do what he does best; dish out death to everyone involved in the kidnapping.<br /><br />In Rayburn's words, "A man can be an artist, food or whatever, it depends on what he's good at.  Creasy's art is death, and he's about to paint his masterpiece."<br /><br />Watch out for some stellar performances by Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, Rahda Mitchell (I am so glad to see this talented actress get another leading role besides Pitch Black, she was great in that movie too), Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke, and (surprise) Marc Anthony.  Yes, he can act, and plays his part of Samuel Ramos with a style and substance that is missing in his singing career.<br /><br />There is wonderful scenery from Mexico City, a tight plot, a wonderful musical score, and a unique and bittersweet climax which all allow Man On Fire to rise up above the "just another revenge movie" it could have been.  The movie itself was a pleasure to watch and IMHO, worthy of purchase.  The only part of the actual movie that I didn't like was using too much of what I call Stutter-Flash scenes; jumpy, flashing scenes that alternate slow-mo and sped-up photography.  While adding to the surrealism of Creasy's world, a little goes a long way, and I think the movie over-uses this effect.<br /><br />What I didn't like about the DVD version was that the only special features available were the running commentaries that seem to have become popular with directors and actors.  To me, this is like having people blathering on annoyingly in the theater while you are trying to watch the movie.  I prefer interviews and behind-the-scenes features to the commentaries.  Also, the subtitles on the screen during the Spanish speaking parts were tiny, forcing blind-ol-me to sit closer to the TV than I wanted to in order to be able to read them.<br /><br />All in all, Man On Fire is a great movie; suspenseful and well acted with a little twisty surprise at the end that actually squeezed a tear from my withered and dried up soul.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

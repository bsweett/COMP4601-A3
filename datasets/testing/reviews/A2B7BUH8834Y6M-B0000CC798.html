The premise of the X-Men franchise is that mankind is evolving... at a geometric rate.  While many remain as humans, more and more &quot;mutants&quot; are born everyday. Seemingly human on the outside, each mutant has a unique mutation that gives them a super-human power. There doesn't seem to be a true &quot;mutation&quot; that is not beneficial... no one is born with an ugly deformity, just a kick-butt super-power. <p>Some can project flames with their thoughts, others can freeze anything they touch. Still others have super hearing, super vision, and some can walk through walls or teleport from one place to another.<p>Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is the proverbial godfather of the mutants, known as &quot;X-men.&quot;  While wheelchair bound, Xavier has incredible telepathic abilities. With what seems like an unlimited personal fortune, Xavier has built a school for the &quot;gifted,&quot; a refuge for kids and young adults who are mutants. Young mutants have their talents honed and learn to control their skills by former school graduates.<p>Non-mutated humans are naturally scared of the mutants, which seem to be everywhere. A teleporting mutant wreaks havoc in the White House, knocking out all Secret Service agents before they can even aim their guns at him. The mutant simply delivers a message to the President, but knowing what this mutant is capable of is enough to make the public terrified and willing to suspend civil liberties to anyone exhibiting mutated powers.<p>Nazi-camp survivor, Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen), is liberated from the metal-free prison from the first X-men film. Now Magneto and other &quot;naughty&quot; mutants must team up with the &quot;good&quot; mutants to protect themselves from a diabolical plot to kill all mutants around the globe.<p>The joining together involves no group hugs or mutual understandings between the hero mutants and the mutants with a score to settle. Only a modicum of respect for each others talents.<p>The central character is still Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). A mutant with a really bad bed hair and big mutton chops. Wolverine has acute hearing, incredible healing abilities, and he has keen fighting skills. In addition, he has had an undestructable metal alloy surgically placed into his hands, which projects giant steal claw-like daggers between his fingers when he senses danger. <p>The special effects in this film are AWESOME. There wasn't one scene in which you could tell that something was either computer generated or not in the same plane of view as the other live action characters. The action is super fast, creative, well choreographed, and just really fun to watch. The ending sets the viewer up for a probable 3rd installment of the X-men series in the not-so-distant future.<p>Is this a deep, life changing film? No way! But if you want to escape into another world for a couple of hours, this is the place to go. As always, the good guys prevail in the end, and a lot of bad people get their butts severely kicked.  If you love SFX and sci-fi, this film will not disappoint.</p></body></html>

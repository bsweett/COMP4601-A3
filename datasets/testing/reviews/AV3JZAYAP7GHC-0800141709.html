An absurdist's dream film that put Kubrick firmly on the map and gave much-deserved international recognition to Peter Sellers for his outstanding work in three separate roles.<p>The first time I saw this was in my college video library. Lots of old top-loading VCRs that seemed bigger than xerox machines, crummy, uncomfortable furniture, lousy headphones. And I was laughing hysterically (in a library, mind you) for nearly the entire film, right to the Vera Miles song at the end that accompanied stunning shots of actual atomic explosions.<p>One of the strengths of this film, unlike most from this era, is that it's Cold War-themed story does not seem outdated. Kubrick leaves most of the politics on the sidelines to focus on the absurdity, and to let the satire ring brilliantly.<p>Yes it's a left-leaning film, but it's also very damn funny and never self-rightous--it's much more intelligent than that. Kubrick's merciless portrayal of the military could be offensive to those who refuse to  understand what satire actually is.<p>But, if you really have a sense of humor about the madness of war and politics--regardless of what side of the divide you're on--I'm sure this will rank among your favorites.

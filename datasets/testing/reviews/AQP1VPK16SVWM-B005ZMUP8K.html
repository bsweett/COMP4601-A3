<meta name="summary" content="An enjoyable sequel to the first film"></head><body><p>"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" surprisingly holds its own and provides solid entertainment. Director Gore Verbinski pulls off a dazzling hat trick by managing to make the sequel entertaining despite all of the excess baggage it carries into theaters. "Dead Man's Chest" is a fun movie pure and simple. Enjoy it for what it is-- a summer movie designed to provide refuge from the heat and you'll have a good time. The film may not be quite as consistent as the first "Pirates" film but it's still enjoyable fun. A plot synposis is below for those interested. There are some minor spoilers so if you don't want to read them and be completely surprised (as I was) by the film, don't read any further.<br /><br />I should warn parents that this, like the first film, might be a bit too scary for some younger kids.<br /><br />***Minor plot spoilers in the third paragraph below***<br /><br />***<br /><br />Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) must find Davy Jones' (a digitally enhanced Bill Nighy of "Love Actually" and "The Constant Gardener) locker to get out of an agreement to give up his soul to the sea dwelling captain. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) are both arrested on their wedding day for aiding Sparrow's escape. The only way they will avoid prison and the death by hanging is to retrieve Sparrow's compass on behalf of the East India Trading Company and Her Majesty. All of this is somehow mysteriously tied into Sparrow's search for Jones' locker.<br /><br />***<br /><br />End of spoilers<br /><br />"Dead Man's Chest" succeeds as entertainment and while it may lack the surprises of the first film it goes down like a delicious desert. Fans will enjoy "Dead Man's Chest" but will have to wait till next year for the resolution to the cliffhanger.</p></body></html>

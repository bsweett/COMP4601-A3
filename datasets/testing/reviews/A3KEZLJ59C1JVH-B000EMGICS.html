<meta name="summary" content="A modern spinoff of one of Hollywood's classic films"></head><body><p>I knew I'd enjoy this movie because I am a big fan of "The Graduate," but I honestly didn't expect "Rumor Has It" to be as good as it is. Sarah (Jennifer Aniston) arrives at her sister's wedding with her fianc&eacute;, Jeff (Mark Ruffalo). Already anxious about her own impending marriage, Sarah is stunned when she learns that her grandmother Katherine (Shirley MacLaine) was the inspiration for the character of Mrs. Robinson in the infamous book and movie "The Graduate." Sarah suspects that Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner), the man Dustin Hoffman's character was based on, might be her biological father, so she scurries away from her family and fianc&eacute; to track Beau down. When she finds him, she is relieved to discover that he is NOT her father, but like her mother and grandmother before her, Sarah is taken in by Beau's charm and ends up in the last place she ever expected to turn up...in Beau's bed.<br /><br />This is a wonderful story and the film boasts an amazing cast. Aniston and Ruffalo deliver their best performances to date. Costner is perfect as the smooth, successful Beau, and there is also a strong supporting cast that includes Richard Jenkins, Mena Suvari, and Kathy Bates. The real star of this film is definitely MacLaine...she steals every scene as the brassy former seductress (who will NOT TOLERATE being called "Grandmother"). Her scenes with Aniston are fabulous, but her confrontation with Costner's character is probably the best scene in the film. (I wish it lasted a little longer...Katherine was totally going to kick Beau's ass!) No one will ever take Anne Bancroft's place as Mrs. Robinson, but there is no other actress who could have played Katherine better than Shirley MacLaine!<br /><br />"Rumor Has It" has more depth than most other romantic comedies in its class. It's a funny movie, but there are a lot of poignant moments. I might go back to the theatre to see this one a second time, and I'll definitely be buying the DVD.</p></body></html>

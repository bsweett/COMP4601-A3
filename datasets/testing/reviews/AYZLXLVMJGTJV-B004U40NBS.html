I liked how the story reflected how people all have different parts, some clearly present and some repressed. I loved the flow of the ballet. I would like to learn how to dance like this. The workouts seemed repetitive, yet it seemed as if it would feel good to the body. Performing in front of an audience seems daunting. Natalie's repressed emotions came out with intensity only with herself. She struggled alone without real understanding. I loved the beautiful cake, I would like to make it and to eat it. Her relationship with her mother went from nurturing to controlling and you felt her underneath emotions want to release. Her letting go with her role on stage was awesome. The whole sequence was riveting. I loved how she made her ballet shoes and I loved her and the dark swans beauty, Natalie's and the other actress. The other actress showed her gusto with the air of deviousness. I loved they way she tucked into the cheeseburger and her sauciness with others.</p></body></html>

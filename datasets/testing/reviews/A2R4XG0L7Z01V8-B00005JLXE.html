Technically, in my opinion, it should be DaredevilMAN (Spiderman, Superman, Batman etc), but they probably thought that was too complex for people to understand.<p>Ben Affleck is really good in this, and he plays the part of a blind guy perfectly! I was a bit sceptical about this, as I wasn't sure it would look right, but by the looks of it, he had contacts in, making him look like he had cataracts or something!<p>Although, he can actually &quot;see&quot; particularly if it's raining, which was kinda weird. The whole scenes where he &quot;sees&quot;, is really very much like the scenes where Keanu Reeves gets blinded in Matrix Revolutions by the nasty guy, and he sees shapes in the fire etc. Well, these scenes are quite similar, although more blue, and nicer.<p>I really Jennifer Garner as a character, although her whole storyline was dropped at one point, for a very good reason. But at the end, it almost seems like she was still around, if you get my drift. (If you've seen the movie, you'll know what I mean!)<p>I didn't like Michael Clarke Duncan as the bad guy in this. After seeing him in movies such as The Green Mile and Armageddon, and others which I forget, he always plays the good guy. He's the big friendly giant, and I just keep seeing him as John Coffey! Everyone knows Michael Clarke Duncan is a bad guy, but he apparently had to gain an additional 40lbs, on top of his usual weight, which would make him pretty heavy! (It doesn't really show, as he looks bigger in Armageddon &amp; The Green Mile)<p>I wasn't sure about Colin Farrell being in this movie. Personally, I don't like the guy, but I'm sure it's the way he's portrayed in the press: doing god-knows-what with Britney Spears,  drinking , smoking, all the things that I find a turn off in a guy. I'm sure he's a perfectly nice guy however. But oh my God, sure he didn't have a lot of lines to learn, but this has to be the first movie I've actually heard him SPEAK in! I've seen trailers for Phone Booth, and believe it or not, all you non-believers out there, the guy is not an American, but he's from Ireland. And he speaks in the most gorgeous 'Orish' accent ever! Shame he didn't have more lines to say, cos I could have listened to him talk all day!<p>If you look closely, you'll see a very surprising person making a cameo! The one and only Kevin Smith! I thought it was him, but he looked different. I think his beard was a lot more trimmed!<p>There's a lot of braille used in the movie, due to the fact that Matt Murdoch is actually blind. The start credits use lights from the skyline to form braille, and then spell out the actors names. Also interesting, the necklace at the end of the movie, also spells out Elektra in braille.<p>Most of the extras look quite good, and I was pleased to finally see the the entire video for Evanescence's &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;. (This was the song that brought them to the attention of the music industry, but another song of theirs &quot;My Immortal&quot;, is used during a funeral scene, adding a whole other dimension to the song. It's one of my faves of their songs, and seeing it played at a funeral scene, is really creepy - the lyrics totally match.) The rest of the extras look good, but basically, you need a chance to actually sit down and view them all. The extras include: audio commentary by director/screenwriter Mark Steven Johnson and producer Gary Foster; &quot;Beyond Hell's Kitchen: Making Daredevil&quot; documentary with optional enhanced viewing mode; Jennifer Garner screen test; 6 multi-angle scene studies; Kingpin featurette; HBO First Look special; &quot;Moving Through Space: A Day with Tom Sullivan&quot;; 3 music videos: &quot;Won't Back Down&quot; by Fuel, &quot;For You&quot; by the Calling, &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; by Evanescence; still gallery; &quot;Men Without Fear: Creating Daredevil&quot; documentary; and &quot;Shadow World Tour&quot;: an in-depth look at &quot;Daredevil's sight&quot;. On the back of the DVD, it is mentioned that there is a gag-reel, but it's not obviously included as a separate extra - it's probably in amongst the extras that I skipped!<p>This is a great DVD, and will be a welcome addition to anyone's collection.</p></body></html>

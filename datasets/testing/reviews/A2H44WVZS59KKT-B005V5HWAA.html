Kevin Costner plays mild-mannered philanthropic family man Earl Brooks exceptionally well.  I appreciated him in this role more than any other I've seen him in in at least ten years.  No, I take that back.  I really enjoyed him in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000TANUI">Open Range</a>, too.<br /><br />William Hurt, who plays the id portion of Earl's subconscious (unseen and unheard by all except Earl) acts out Earl's psychopathic desires and addiction to killing.<br /><br />Dane Cook steps out of his comedy comfort zone and plays voyeur/wannabe killer Mr. Smith and does an amazingly credible job of it.<br /><br />There is also Demi Moore playing a millionaire police detective.  Her role just added a bit too much fluff to the overall plot.  She had too much going on in her personal life and it wasn't needed for the clarity of the movie.<br /><br />Earl also has a wife, Emma(Marg Helgenberger) and daughter, Jane(Danielle Panabaker).  Jane's role was an integral part of the movie although I think it could have been cut some.<br /><br />It has been a long time since I actually jumped during a movie from surprise/fright but they got me on this one.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys thrillers, murder movies, stories about serial killers.<br /><br />WARNING:  There is violence in this movie, some nudity, strong language, sexual scenes.</p></body></html>

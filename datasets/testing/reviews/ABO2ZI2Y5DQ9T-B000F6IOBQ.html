<meta name="summary" content="Better Actions and More Blood Than the Original: Enjoyable Film Weakened by its Confusing Script"></head><body><p>I know many people really enjoyed the film. Critics say the film's story is badly written, but I tried not to listen. No, while watching `Underworld Evolution,' I was just thinking about who is good and who is bad, which is the best way for me to enjoy the action sequences. But sorry, I couldn't finally bring myself to love this one.<br /><br />I don't summarize the film. Other reviewers have done it better. I only say you must see the original `Underworld' before watching this sequel. In the chapter below I repeat what I have seen in the first 20 minutes only, and you know what I mean.<br /><br />As `Underworld Evolution' opens, you must read a sketchy prologue that tells us about the history of Lycans and Vampires. Then in its opening flashback sequences, the film goes back to the year 1202, when the troops led by Viktor are hunting William, a twin brother of Marcus. And then, finally, we are to meet Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and Michael (Scott Speedman) on the run from the Vampire clan, somewhere in the Eastern Europe though the film does not explain how and why they managed to travel there.<br /><br />All these things happen in the earlier chapters, which is too much for me to understand. Some footage from the first film tries to explain the background of the new story, but it doesn't work. I have seen the first `Underworld' when it was released, and remember the key elements of the film, but even so the additional information only helped confuse me. Director Len Wiseman and co-writer Danny McBride seem to stick to the principle -- the more, the better. My idea is, `Why not make it simple?'<br /><br />I admit that actions are better than the first ones. They are packed with gore and violence, and Len Wiseman clearly wants them that way. I do not disagree with his decision, and I find the fight sequences are largely enjoyable. However, the cheesy sex scenes are another thing. They are rather pointless and emotionless, cheapening the entire film. The special effects also need improvement, and Michael's transformation into werewolf is far from seamless.<br /><br />When all is said and done, `Underworld Evolution' is a reasonable sequel, better than the first one. It also knows its target audiences, and provides what they want (it fared better than the original on the US box-office chart). But I still don't know why the story should be so convoluted.<br /><br />By the way, it is Lily Mo Sheen (Kate Beckinsale's daughter) who plays the young Selene. Why not use her more, and forget about Derek Jabobi's character?</p></body></html>

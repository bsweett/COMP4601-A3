After all, our friends in Hollywood only come up with two or three original plots or ideas every year, and most of those are on the indy front. <p>Special affects wise, this was a really solid display of visuals. Plot-wise, this movie stunk up the theatre. The blatant political spin was hilarious. They are, as usual, so very subtle. You might find your stance on homelessness, atheism, global warming, immigration, gas usage and your views on the third world being challenged. The third world becomes the place to be, American usage of natural resources is ridiculed, and the great philosophers of the film happen to be a homeless man who steals hot dogs and an atheist with a warm spot for Western society. As for immigrants? You will no doubt change your view on immigration and welcome anyone into our country who wants our way of life (sarcasm).</p></body></html>

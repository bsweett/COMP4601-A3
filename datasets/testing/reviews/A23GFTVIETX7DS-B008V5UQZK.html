Toula, a woman of Greek heritage who feels that something in her life must change, finds her salvation in Ian, a WASPish school teacher.  However, love does not conquer all since Ian's repressed parents find Toula and her family garish and overwhelming, and Toula's overly emotional family finds Ian and his family too, well, non-Greek.  As the title suggests, the real focus of this film is on Toula and her family, with their huge family &quot;impromptu&quot; gatherings, lamb on a spit in the front yard, and their superstitious rituals.  All these idiosyncrasies provide hilarious scenes that build on one another, culminating in Toula and Ian's improbable wedding.<p>The success of this movie arises partly out of low expectations, as it was a sleeper that only after months of word-of-mouth praise became a blockbuster.  The premise and ultimate plot progression is formulaic - a more or less typical romantic comedy.  Viewers won't find anything groundbreaking in comedy here.  Its strength lies in the individual caricatures of Toula's family and the charm of outwardly ordinary Nia Vardalos, who plays Toula.  Toula's reactions to her family's commandeering of her wedding are priceless in their exaggeration.  The film concludes as one would expect, although the ride to get there has been fun and full of laughs. I will never again pick up a bottle of Windex without smiling.  <p>If you don't expect too much of this film, you'll love it.  I recommend it for an evening of amusing entertainment when you don't feel like watching anything demanding.  While I would expect women to enjoy it more than men, I've found many male friends who highly recommend it - maybe because it reminds them of the trials with their own in-laws.  Fans of &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; and &quot;The Birdcage&quot; will probably like this movie as well.</p></body></html>

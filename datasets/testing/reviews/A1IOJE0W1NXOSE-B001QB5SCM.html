<meta name="summary" content="Shirly MacLaine is the catalyst"></head><body><p>How can two sisters be so different?  Toni Collette plays Rose, a big-city lawyer who is a real straight arrow.  Her sister Maggie, played by Cameron Diaz, is an irresponsible party girl who specializes in sponging off her relatives and avoiding work at all costs.  This movie starts out rather slowly and does not really pick up speed until the appearance of Shirley MacLaine, the sisters' long-lost grandmother.  She attempts to make up for lost time, first with Maggie and then with Rose.  She never pushes them, but under her patient guidance, Maggie begins to find herself and discover that she has a brain in addition to the obvious physical attributes which she has always depended on.  Somehow, under her subtle guidance, the sisters are able to stop feuding and start acknowledging the strong bond between them.  Interesting characters who add a lot to the movie include the sisters' overbearing stepmother and Rose's caring fiance.  When all is said and done, however, it is Shirley MacLaine the talented veteran, who steals the show.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great comedy"></head><body><p>I believe Jack Black could sit in a room and make faces and have me in hysterics! I love this guy! Ever since watching 'High Fidelity' I've been hooked on Jack Black flicks. Nacho Libre is about a porky monk who has always dreamed of being a champion wrestler. Add a skinny side-kick who used to scrounge for scraps in an alley and anything can happen... Great comedy and great fun!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

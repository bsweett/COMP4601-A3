<meta name="summary" content="Liked 'Identity' better, but still riveting cinema"></head><body><p>You can tell 'Bourne Identity' was a sleeper hit just by looking at the scope of 'Bourne Sumpremacy' - India, Moscow, New York, Berlin and other locales - in particular, huge, costly, shut-down-the-streets production pieces in Berlin and Moscow.  And, there's no doubt it makes for a riveting two hours of cinema.<br /><br />I've seen reviews that say 'surpasses the original.'  I'm not sure of that.  I liked the cleaner storyline of the original, plus more of Chris Cooper and (especially) the wonderful Franka Potente.  Furthermore, the original was such a pleasant surprise - like most people, I went on a whim with no expectations and was really taken in by Dougie Liman's direction and the raw intensity of Matt Damon's performance.  [Mr. Damon's internal gyroscope - the one that sniffs out good roles in well-made films - continues to function flawlessly. Erstwhile buddy Ben Affleck ought to be taking notes.]<br /><br />Two comments here about the Russian antagonists in the film:<br /><br />- In the book, this is a Cold War confrontation, government-to-government.  In its film incarnation, in order to have present day significance, screenwriter Tony Gilroy had to do a major overhaul to make it more of a quasi-corporate skirmish with an ear skillfully tuned to modern-day Russian Oligarchism.  My compliments - it's a masterful job turned in by Mr. Gilroy.<br /><br />- I couldn't help but stifle a laugh at 'Gretkov,' Karel Roden's oligarch-like character.  He's got it nailed, from his Khordokovsky-like wireless-rimmed glasses to his Abramovich-like perfectly coiffed four-day or so stubble.  Bravo, Mr. Roden.  You've done your homework well.</p></body></html>

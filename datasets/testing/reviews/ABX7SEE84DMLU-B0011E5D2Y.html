<meta name="summary" content="Funny Premise"></head><body><p>This movie has a great premise.  Yes, it requires a huge suspension of disbelief, but once you get over that reality barrier, it's tremendous fun.<br /><br />Woven into it, though, are a few themes which are not quite so obvious:<br /><br />1.  Exploiting other people by lying is not attractive.<br />2.  Rich people suck.  Or they don't, depending.<br />3.  In movies like this, everybody gets what they deserve.<br />4.  Never play touch football at a politician's house.<br />5.  Does Owen really look like he should be a family member at a ____ wedding?  (Jewish, Irish, WASP, Greek, Italian - you pick).<br /><br />The fun is totally infectious.  My favorite scene:  the opening where these two lawyers function as the funniest divorce mediators I've ever seen.  And I could not stop laughing when we find out that the couple is in a contested divorce over frequent flyer miles.<br /><br />Subtle, but really witty.</p></body></html>

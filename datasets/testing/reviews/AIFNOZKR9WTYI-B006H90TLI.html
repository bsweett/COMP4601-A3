Its based on the novel of the same name by an ultra-pretentious and hyper-established hack named Cormac McCarthy.  The story telling (in both the book and movie, I'd imagine) is completely unrealistic.  Here's an example of crummy dialog.  Trailer trash protagonist to wife as he is heading out the door to do something dangerous: "If'n Ahh don't cum back, say hello to Muther fer me."  "But LouEllin, Yer Muther is dade!"  (considers a moment) "Well, then Ahh reckin Ahhl tell'r muhself."<br />The movie is psychologically completely unrealistic.  For example, toward the end, the "Sheriff" (who does absolutely nothing and seems to have no interest in actually apprehending anyone or doing more than read the paper and occasionally offer a bit of folk wisdom), played by Tommy Lee "Folksy" Jones, ruminates about some dreams he had to his long-suffering wife.  "Ahh had me some dreams lass naght."  "Anythang innnarestin'?"  "They alwuz iaz to the party concerned."<br />Now, this is false.  Dreams are a digestive product directly analogous to feces.  I have written down my own dreams for more than ten years and can report that frequently I have to force myself to write down a dream, forcibly overcoming an aversion to revisiting it, not because it was unpleasant but simply because the most frequent first impression of most remembered dreams is that the dream is too worthless to recount.  But none of this matters in the mind of Cormac McCarthy or the Coen brothers.  They are not interested in reality, only gimcrack everyman profundities that fall apart the moment they are looked at steadily.  McCarthy is a man who likes the sound of his own supposed eloquence.  He is imbued with the notion that just because a sentence comes out of him, it's got to be good.  This is what makes for bad, fraudulent writing.  Hemingway was exactly the same.  And so you have stylized gibberish like when Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Any real need for that ungainly middle name, Cormac?  Usually down south the first and middle names are carefully chosen so that the nicknames can be run together, like Robert Joseph becoming Bobby-Jo.) says of himself and his deceased father, "We wuz sheriffs at the same tahm.  Ahh think he's proud of that.  Ahh know Ahh wuz."  Why the mixing of tenses, other than a knee-jerk narcissistic urge toward pretentious bilge?  I mean, why is Sheriff Bell's father, who is deceased, STILL proud of this fact, whereas Sheriff Bell himself is, seemingly, NO LONGER proud of this fact.  It's not deep, it's just nonsense.  And, no, this is not The Hunting of the Snark.  I tried to look at the movie from that angle and it doesn't work.<br />The movie is unrealistic in too many ways to enumerate.  However, one example of how crizap No Country For Old Men is, which most people would consider nit-picking, is the following:  LouEllin, the trailer trash protagonist, is hunting deer when he stumbles across the scene of a drug deal gone bad, with dead bodies everywhere, a bunch of kilos of Columbian bam-bam and the inevitable tired stock plot element of the Briefcase Full of A LOT of Dirty Money.  He then decides that some one of this group who shot each other to hell and gone must have survived and walked away from the scene.  So he takes a submachine gun from one of the dead guys and, slinging his own rifle across his back, goes in search of this fugitive.  He finds him some while later and, leaving his rifle behind, he goes to investigate holding the  newly-acquired (Uzi-like) submachine gun.  This is completely unrealistic.  No person familiar with guns would, in a bad situation, exchange his own rifle for a weapon he is completely unfamiliar with and which he has never test fired or even inspected to be sure it is not jammed.  The movie is full of stuff like this.  I believe it won Best Picture.  This is what the world is, halfwits making entertainment for halfwits who then praise the other halfwits to the skies.<br />  Another key plot device of No Country For Old Men is that the Bad Guy, a killer who dresses all in black, originally enough, goes around with a cattle gun, which is an air powered device that shoots and then retracts a bolt, used to stun cattle.  This cattle gun derives its compressed air from a large metal oxygen tank that he lugs around, not to breathe out of but merely to power the cattle gun.  He uses this cattle gun to kill people and also, many times, to knock the cylinder clean out of door locks.  The scene is, the cattle gun busts the lock cylinder right out of the door and it goes shooting across the room.  As I say, this happens many, many times.<br />  So this morning I'd had enough of this nonsense and I called a locksmith to ask his opinion.  The guy I talked to had actually seen the movie and so he knew exactly what I was talking about.  He said that it was completely unrealistic and that he laughed when he saw it.  However, this preposterousness did not cause him to stop taking the movie seriously, strangely enough.  Seemingly people do not go to see movies expecting any degree of realism of any kind, be it physical, mechanical, psychological, what have you.  In short, a people get the movies it deserve.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Decent movie."></head><body><p>'The Fog' is a decent horror movie from the talented director John Carpenter.  He was the guy who created the original 'Halloween' movie and the remake of 'The Thing'. The story is about a mysterious fog that envelopes a small town.  The fog contains a haunted ship.  The ghosts of the ship are wanting revenge from an incident that happened one hundred years earlier.  As with many horror movies, one has to suspend various logical flaws and unlikely coincidences.  But the movie is driven my the suspense and an eerie atmosphere.  The most memorable character is the female disc jockey who attempts to warn the town of the fog.  The movie has a cool ending also.</p></body></html>

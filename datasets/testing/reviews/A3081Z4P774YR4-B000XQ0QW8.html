I also enjoyed seeing the deleted scenes, and the little documentaries on the subject matter that makes up &quot;Unbreakable&quot;.  I have to confess I didn't see this film when it was in theatres, and for the most part, people I talked to who did see it were pretty divided. One of the things that impressed me about &quot;Unbreakable&quot; was that it didn't stay in a conventional genre.  It's not really a drama, a thriller, or even a comic-book type film.  The performances are solid and the ending (while being somewhat abrupt, and being a major punching bag in the negative reviews of this film) works just fine.  It's a flawed, but impressive film nonetheless.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sharp looking transfer for Carpenter classic provides improvement over previous DVD edition"></head><body><p>John Carpenter's classic science fiction/horror film receives a terrific upgrade for HD-DVD. I must admit I was reluctant to pick this up only because I had picked up a couple of HD-DVD discs of late that didn't quite live up to the hype (due to faulty or weak transfers not to the technology). Universal has basically slapped the high definition transfer from the previous edition with the bonus features and remastered them for the new format. Is it a huge improvement over the DVD edition? No but it does look better than the previous edition of the film on DVD (the high definition anamorphic transfer).<br /><br />For those that need to know the plot summary I've included it at the end. A remote American Arctic station comes across a group of Norweign scientists trying to kill a sled dog by shooting it from their helicopter. When they show up at the American station one is accidently killed while the other is shot by the station commander (Donald Moffit). The group of scientists/helicopter pilots take the dog in but quickly discover its some sort of alien metamorph that can become a perfect replica of anything it touches. It operates much like an infectious disease. Mac (Kurt Russell)galvanizes the others to try and destroy the thing as it gradually begins picking off the crew now cut off from possible escape because of a vicious storm.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Off with the Head: Park up your brains and enjoy the Ride"></head><body><p>This is the most notable and the most used line: "Off with his Head!" This is exclaimed by the Queen of Hearts once someone does something to upset her. This character along with the Mad Hatter make this movie truly hilarious and enjoyable. If you are looking for a serious film with a strong plot, look elsewhere.<br /><br />The strength of this film is in the area of its visuals, no effort is spared here, it is a lot of fun to watch. The story concept is one that has been beaten to a pulp. This is: start in the real world, go to fantasy world, end back in the real world. But, who cares, it can work here too.<br /><br />This film continues where the original book ended off. Alice is now grown up. At first she has difficulty in coming to terms with her return to Wonderland. But as time goes along she comes to terms with her destiny. There is a lot of action and quirky aspects that has become the hallmark of the director, Mr. Tim Burton.</p></body></html>

Jason Bourne is still an amnesiac, but as the movie progresses he remembers more details of his previous life.  It's sometimes difficult to tell the good guys from the bad guys, because someone is framing Bourne and has sicced his old agency on him.  Everyone is after him but Bourne manages to avoid bullets, stakeouts, booby traps and whatever else the intelligence community can throw at him.  Matt Damon does a creditable job in the lead role and this movie is good for an evening's entertainment.</p></body></html>

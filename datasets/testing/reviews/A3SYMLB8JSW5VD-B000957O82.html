The plot is about self-proclaimed date doctor played by Will Smith who helps men who have a hard time meeting women. He seems to have all the answers until fate would have it. He meets the women of his dreams played by Eva Mendes. But the date doctor can't seem to do anything right. That when the laughs begins. But the real star of this movie is Kevin James who's totally clueless yet funny at the same time trying to win his dream girl. This is flat-funny and a real treasure.</p></body></html>

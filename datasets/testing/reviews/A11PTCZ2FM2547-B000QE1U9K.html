<meta name="summary" content="The Series Should Have Ended With This One"></head><body><p>Talk about some imagination.  Where, oh where, do the caretakers of the Alien franchise set up the third installment?  To come up with an isolated, desolate planet harboring what was once a maximum security prison--a place where its inhabitants have virtually no defenses against a snarling monster--is sheer genius.  And that's exactly where we find ourselves as ALIEN3 unfolds its disturbing, claustrophobic story:  a spaceship crash, with Ripley--and of course, one of the facehuggers--as the lone survivor, on a planet with some very bad men who've done very bad things. . .and there's no place to escape.<br /><br />Count me in.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver really ups the tragic pathos of her beloved Ripley character; this is one depressed lady with some serious angst--and she's trying her best to convince her new associates that something very, very bad is about to happen to all of them.  In fact, something very, very bad is about to happen to Ripley herself, and it's this realization that adds an extra thread of tension as ALIEN3 rolls darkly to its climax.  (I must confess, the alien's demise was too over-the-top, but didn't take away from my enjoyment of the film.)<br /><br />Once again, Weaver is joined by a strong supporting cast, including Charles S. Dutton, Charles Dance, and Danny Webb, to name but a few.  Lance Henriksen returns, briefly, as a severely damaged Bishop, then as greedy entrepreneur Bishop II.  Director David Fincher, following Ridley Scott and James Cameron, definitely had his work cut out for him, and for the most part delivers a grand seat squirmer, yet in comparison ALIEN3 falls a little short of its fantastic predecessors.  Having said that, and based on the horrific turkey that was to follow, the Alien series should have said adios here.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

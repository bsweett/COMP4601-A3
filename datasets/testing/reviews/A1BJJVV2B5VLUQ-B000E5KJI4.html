<meta name="summary" content="10 year war condensed to 2 hours and 42 minutes"></head><body><p>OVERVIEW: Most national newspaper reviews were average at best for "Troy" (2004). I went into this movie not expecting much - which was probably the best way to go. I had several years of latin & mythology in high school and college and liked the subject matter in general (though I don't claim to be a Greek historian as some writers here seem to be). I knew most of the players here, but I don't think it's essential to know them going in. You quickly know that this movie is depicting a battle between two very distinct sides (Greeks vs Trojans). I think if you enjoy movies and like to be entertained by Hollywood - you'll enjoy "Troy". However, if you go into this film expecting things to unfold how historian's have documented - you'll be sorely disappointed. This is the Reader's Digest 'condensed' version of a 10 year war - taking place over about 2 weeks. "Troy" fits in nicely with the other ancient era/period movies like "Ben Hur", "Clash Of The Titans", "Spartacus", "Ulysses", "Hercules", "The Odyssey", "Jason & The Argonauts", "Gladiator", and even Marlon Brando's "Julius Caesar".<br /><br />THE GOOD: Director Wolfgang Peterson ("The Perfect Storm", "Air Force One", "Das Boot", "In The Line Of Fire") has the reputation for making a good action film. He does not disappoint in making "Troy". There are some truly great battle scenes featured here; a great fight between the lead characters of the Greek Achilles and the Trojan Hector. There is also some wonderful scenery - the vast many ships out on the Aegean Sea, the huge walls around the city of Troy, the sweeping shots of the armies on the beach as well as outside the great entrance to Troy's city. The male cast is exceptional. Brad Pitt as the ultimate warrior Achilles; Eric Bana as the patriotic Hector; Orlando Bloom perfectly playing wimpy Paris; Peter O'Toole as Troy's King Priam; Brian Cox as the loathsome Greek King Agamemnon; Sean Bean as supportive Odysseus. The story revolves around Paris stealing Menelaus' wife (Helen) and bringing her back to Troy. Menelaus wants her back and decides to go to his brother (Agamemnon) to fight for her. Turns out Agamemnon isn't so much in it for his brother as much as he wants to conquer Troy itself. Enter Paris running away from Menelaus, Hector killing Menelaus, Agamemnon declaring war, lots of fighting, a Trojan Horse, a city on fire, and so on. History books tell us the Trojan War lasted 10 years. "Troy" appears to last about 2 weeks. While there were some great scenes in "Troy" - Achilles battling Hector, King Priam sneaking into Achilles tent and asking for his dead son's body back for a proper burial, the hundreds of ships in the Aegean Sea arriving on the Trojan shores, the whole Trojan horse scene - there are several things that prevent me from giving this movie a higher rating.<br /><br />THE NOT SO GOOD: Brad Pitt was good, but not great. Some of his lines were just not convincing. His choreographed fight scenes seemed somewhat labored. His death scene was uneventful. His pecks and abs looked fine (as my wife would agree). Pitt was no Russell Crowe (in "Gladiator"), or Mel Gibson (in "Braveheart")... not even close. I like Pitt, and loved his lunacy in "Fight Club", "12 Monkeys" and "Seven" - perhaps "Troy" was too 'calm' for him. Most of the females in this movie were disappointing. The main female was Helen (Diane Kruger). A somewhat limp and feeble woman - I was expecting a stronger character role here - one that wasn't so love-struck or sobbing so dang much. As good as Brian Cox was as Agamemnon, I felt he was too short for this movie. Anything I've ever read in mythology said Agamemnon was monsterous in size. I recognized several 2nd and 3rd tier actors in "Troy" that had played supporting roles in the similar era/period type movies "Braveheart" and "Gladiator". The soundtrack was also very reminiscent of "Gladiator". The 2-disc DVD set was overkill. I guess with 2 discs, I somehow expect a boat-load of extras. Not so here - the six DVD extras here total about 50 minutes. Included is the trailer, a language choice selection, "Gallery Of the Gods" (giving a brief history lesson on 12 Greek Gods - from Apollo to Zeus), a battle and a historical perspective, and a special effects odyssey (rubber swords et all). While the DVD extras were good and gave a keen look inside the making of the film, they were by no mean extensive. All of this could have easily fit on one disc. At 162 minutes, prepare for a good sit with plenty of popcorn and a Coke. "Troy" falls into the ranks of the mega-blockbusters with its $200+ million budget. It did well at the box office for several weeks, but then fell way short of it's projected in take ($)... thus, in my prediction, dooming it come Oscar time (3.5 stars).</p></body></html>

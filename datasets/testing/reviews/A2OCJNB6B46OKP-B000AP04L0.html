Eventhough there are some overly exageratted scenes in this movie (oh and they are extremly funny), there are so many things I myself pointed at the screen saying 'That happened to me!'<br /><br />This movie is not one to be missed it IS the movie you need to watch when you come home from work. The characters are great, Mike Judge even got the stereotypes correct in the software field. There is always a huge woman sitting at the front desk directing calls, there is always an Indian guy (if you have called Dell computers for assistance you know I am right.) And yes there is always a geekey looking guy who acts like a hot shot, whom you have to lick the scum off of his shoes everyday just to prevent yourself from getting fired.<br /><br />To Mike Judge and the cast of 'Office Space', thank you for showing us all how to stick it to the man because we are all too big of whimps to do it ourselves.</p></body></html>

Yeah, there have been some horrible, horrible missteps along the way (anyone remember Jade?), but a lot of movies that were castigated in the media seemed to me to be a whole lot better than people were making them out to be (anyone remember Rules of Engagement or the remake of 12 Angry Men?) Whatever the reason, a guy who pretty much ruled the roost in the seventies has sunk into such obscurity that his latest film, Bug, played on only 1,661 screens at the peak of its theatrical exposure. (Contrast this to the 4,362 screens on which Pirates of the Carribean: At World's End played the same weekend.) It is, at least, some consolation that long after Gore Verbinski's career is a footnote at best in film almanacs, William Friedkin's greatest films will still be available on holodisc or whatever they watch movies on that far in the future. Bug, in my opinion, will be one of them, on a par with The Exoricst and The French Connection.<br /><br />It shares a lot with those two movies, actually, under its surface. On top, they couldn't be more different; Bug is a somewhat ribald, if creepy, tale about Agnes (Ashley Judd), a waitress whose friend sets her up with Peter (Michael Shannon, who cut his indie teeth in The Woodman and Deadbirds, among others), a drifter who seems like a very welcome change from Agnes' abusive ex-husband Goss (Harry Connick, Jr.), who's just gotten out of prison and is sure to be sniffing around soon. Agnes and Peter, both lost souls in the desolate armpit of an uncaring world, find themselves drawn to one another, but things get complicated with the arrival of minuscule, carnivorous, and very hungry bugs.<br /><br />I spent the first half of this movie wondering what all the fuss was about. Then the three-quarters of what was left. I mean, I enjoyed it well enough; Harry Connick Jr. showed us in Copycat that he makes a mean, twisted bad guy, and he does it here just as well, while Shannon and Judd are their usual excellent selves. Friedkin's direction is spot-on, and I get the feeling that the pace, which often feels as if it's far too slow, is absolutely deliberate. For whatever the trailers may be telling you, Bug is not a horror movie. Bug is about tension, paranoia, drama. It will take you a while to realize what Friedkin and scriptwriter Tracy Letts (adapted from his own play) are doing with this; the movie explodes, the evil machinations of the people behind the scenes blindside you, and you really have no recourse but to say "holy crap." Friedkin and Letts have pulled a fast one on us, and the sucker-punch at the end is just fantastic.<br /><br />None of this should be new to Friedkin fans. The Exorcist is two hours of buildup with a rather stock mystery plot before we get to see any classic cinema. The French Connection is notorious for the slowness of its first half. What do you think would attract a director like Friedkin to a remake of 12 Angry Men? This is a guy who likes to spend a whole lot of time setting things up in precise ways so that he can come barrelling out of nowhere with a freight train when you're least expecting it. And Bug is Friedkin's strongest showing in this arena in over three decades; it may, in fact, even be better structured than The Exorcist. The only thing that's missing is the late and very much lamented Jason Miller. **** ?</p></body></html>

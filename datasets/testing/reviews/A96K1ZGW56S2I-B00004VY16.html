<meta name="summary" content="An Indy wannabe + old horror classic =THE MUMMY"></head><body><p>When THE MUMMY first came out all my friends told me it was a really good movie that reminded them of Indiana Jones. When I finally first watched this film, I was let down. It seemed to me to be a poor imitation of the Indy films. However, after watching it several times since then, I have come to enjoy the movie much more.<p>Brendan Fraser's O'Connel starts off as an Indy wannabe. However, by the time the final credits role, he has become his own character. Much of the plot is taken from Universal's orignial THE MUMMY, but this time instead of a Mummy who strangles people to death, the Mummy sucks out the life from his victims and spews forth plagues from his mouth. The special effects are magnificient and though the acting is a bit cheesy, one must not forget that this is not a dramatic masterpiece. The movie is filled with humor, taking away from some of the more gruesome points in the film.  Overall, the tongue-in-cheek revamp of the original THE MUMMY, along with the great special effects make this fun movie a tasty piece of mind-candy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A comedy-thriller that stands the test of time"></head><body><p>This is definitely a DVD to have and to rewatch with friends and family. The story is familiar - a man is mistaken for a spy and has to get out of the mess without dying - but the acting and scenes are fresh and stunning. <p>It's pretty sexual for a film of its time - Roger has been married many times and has no qualms about seducing the beautiful young woman on the train. Not that she needs seducing - in the original version she meets him while eating, and says that she wants to finish dinner because she doesn't like to make love on an empty stomach. Not too bad for a first date!<p>The crop-dusting scene is famous and much-copied, as are several other scenes. It's the interpersonal relationships where this movie shines, though. The jealousy of the two men who both love Eva, the way that James' henchman is fond of him (and jealous of Eva) ... there are romantic pentagons in this film, never mind triangles. <p>The special features on the DVD are well worth watching, giving extra insight into the characters and the way the movie was made. Grab a copy for your home, and another for a friend as a present! It's a movie that you'll find something new in each time you watch it.</p></body></html>

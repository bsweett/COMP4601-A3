Telly Paretta (Julianne Moore) is grieving the loss of her son Sam (Christopher Kovaleski) who seemly died in a plane crash. Her psychiatrist (Gary Sinise) is trying to convince her that she never had a son. Who and  what is behind this?<br /><br />The NSA cover up leads to alien abductors experimenting with humans has been already covered. The X-files and Twilight Zone shows come to mind. The acting was great and visual effects were enough to carry this movie to the box office. I was disappointed with the unexplained alien interaction with the human element. The movie ends as a Sci-Fi thriller that does not deliver. I guess the aliens are running the world. (Were have I seen that before?)<br /><br />The relationship between mother and child is the unbreakable bond that not even an alien can break. There are two stories here that should have been separated.<br /><br />Alfre Woodard (Detective Anne Pope) and Anthony Edwards (Jim Paretta) play supporting roles and are under utilized.</p></body></html>

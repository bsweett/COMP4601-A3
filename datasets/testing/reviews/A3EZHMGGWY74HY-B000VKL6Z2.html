<meta name="summary" content="Too disturbing for this horror fan"></head><body><p>I am a huge fan of the original Halloween, so took a chance on this one.  Although I always thought that the original film left gaps in the story...why was Michael the way he was?...yes, Rob answered this for us folks, but how difficult it was to watch this poor boy living in this over the top dysfunctional home! It makes sense to the story, but I found it too disturbing to watch. He was a much more believable Michael, we understood where he was coming from, his pain was too huge for a young child to handle...but did I really want to know these details and suffer along with this young boy?  Heck, no! To top it all off, Zombie movies (which I should have known!) are far too grotesque and bloody for my taste.  The original movie had just the right amount of gore, suspense, scary music and fear.  I didn't need to be taken to the next level of horror, so I shut the movie off.  I never finished it because what I had seen was more than enough.  I wondered, afterward, about our society and what makes us love these type of movies.  If these horrific events happened to anyone we knew, we wouldn't be so anxious to watch them on the big screen. The fact is that the world is hard enough, scary enough, dark enough...we hardly need to be on a journey of insanity for two hours and then watch the bonus features so we can see more about how they made the gore fest come to life! This one is just over the top, and not enough of an improvement on the original to make it worth seeing.  Watch some quality horror, something that scares you, but doesn't make you want to be sick.</p></body></html>

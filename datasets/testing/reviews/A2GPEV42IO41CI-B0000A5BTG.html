<meta name="summary" content="The end of the world never looked so bad"></head><body><p>In this grim and silly drama, our government has developed a secret weapon called "Destiny" which can cause devastating earthquakes anywhere in the world. This has caused massive amounts of radiation to wipe out the California, Rome, and other cities around the globe. A team is chosen (which includes astronaut Hillary Swank and professor Aaron Eckheart) to build an earthship and fly it earthship down to the center of the earth carrying and deploy four nuclear bombs.<br /><br />I was ready to bail at this point, because it was just too ridiculous. The fact that the actors played it with poker faces made it even more absurd.  There is never any sense of danger because the lead actors take it all in stride as just another day at the office. Neither Swank nor Eckheart were convincing in their roles, so despite a big-budget-look, the film falls flat.</p></body></html>

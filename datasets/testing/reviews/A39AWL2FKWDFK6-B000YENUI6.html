<meta name="summary" content="Excellent expose of the Russian mafia"></head><body><p>Director David Cronenberg follows up his notable flick, "A History of Violence" with a well edited tale of the London based Russian mafia, "Eastern Promises".  Shot around the streets of London, this dark and gloomily filmed movie gives off an air of danger and foreboding.<br /><br />The film commences as a young 14 year old pregnant Russian girl is rushed to the hospital where Naomi Watts playing Russian American Anna Khitrova works as a midwife.  The girl dies delivering a baby girl leaving behind a diary that when translated tells a pathetic story of rape, drugs and forced prostitution.  A business card in her possesion leads Watts to the Trans Siberian restaurant, headquarters of vory v zakone (mafia) boss Semyon played by venerable actor Armin Mueller-Stahl.<br /><br />Working for Stahl as an enforcer and driver is Nikolai Luzhin played superbly by Viggo Mortensen.  Mortensen expertly gives the aura of a tough, remorseless criminal never losing his authentic sounding accent throughout the film.  He is also the watchdog over Stahl's unstable son Kirill played by Vincent Cassel.  The heavily tattooed Mortensen does most of the heavy lifting for this mob but takes a liking to Watts who is drawn to Stahl as he coaxes her to allow him to translate the diary.  Stahl, all the while wishes to destroy the evidence of his dastardly deeds chronicled within those pages.<br /><br />The movie plays out with Watts and her family trying to protect the baby while Mortensen and Cassel carry out their criminal duties for their boss.  The movie contains many graphic displays of violence and bloody gore particularly in a sauna bath knife fighting scene which Mortensen plays in the buff.<br /><br />The not totally expected conclusion ties a nice bow around a supenseful and revealing film that had few if any dull moments featuring a well directed cast with succinct and purposeful dialogue and action.</p></body></html>

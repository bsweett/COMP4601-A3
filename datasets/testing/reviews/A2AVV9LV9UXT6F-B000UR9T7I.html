<meta name="summary" content="A good movie, but could have been better"></head><body><p>Many others here in these reviews have already pointed out how the inclusion of too many villians hurt this movie.  You would think the makers of this film would have learned from the horror that was "Batman and Robin" that that doesn't work.  The reasons should be obvious to a first year film student: put too many characters in and none end up getting enough screen time to be developed properly.  I think the most probable reason they do this sort of thing in superhero movies is because the most popular superheroes in comics, like Batman and Spider-Man, have so many great and memorable villains in their rogues galleries that, given the likelihood of getting only two or three, or maybe four movies made before the actor playing the hero won't come back to play the part again, or wants too much money, or is just too old, they have to put several villains in at once in order to hit all the ones that just HAVE to be put onscreen.  At least that's the only reason I can think of to explain why they make such an elementary and obvious mistake.  One hopes this movie will reinforce the lesson that when it comes to villains, less really is more, but I rather doubt it will.<br /><br />The other main problem with this movie is also common to the superhero genre, on both big screen and small: unsympathetic love interests.  In romance, the chase is more dramatic than the victory and its aftermath.  When the hero is trying to win the heart of his love the audience is pulling for him, and hoping he'll succeed, and tuning in to see if he will.  Once he's got her, a lot of that dramatic tension is simply gone, and viewers may lose interest.  So the writers, in order to put the success of that romance in jeopardy, and thus maintain dramatic tension, constantly have to come up with things that keep pulling the hero and his girl apart.  The problem is, this can only be taken so far before it starts to make the characters look immature, selfish, and unsympathetic.  You can see it in "Superman Returns" where Lois comes off looking selfish, spiteful, and passive-aggressive to the point where you can't help but wonder what the hell Superman sees in her.  The same thing happened to Lana in the TV series "Smallville" (which is a pity since Lana started out in season one as a very sympathetic character).  Well Mary Jane gets the same treatment here.  In scene after scene she seems positively determined to misunderstand Peter, ascribe the worst of motives to him, and refuse to give him any benefit of doubt.  He tries to comfort her after she gets a bad review, and she bites his head off for telling her he knows what it's like to be mocked and misunderstood.  Before a crowd (and clearly for their benefit) Peter, in costune as Spider-Man, lets a girl whose life he's saved kiss him, and Mary Jane, who as a young, good-looking actress is certainly someone whose work would require her to kiss another man than her boyfriend for a role, and should understand that was just showmanship, but she holds it against him.  Mary Jane instead of calling Peter when she'd feeling a bit down, runs off to spend time his best friend and then initiates a kiss with him, and so on.  This hurts the movie because it makes Mary Jane a fickle, undependable, untrusting, unsympathetic girl that he just might be better off without.<br /><br />The movie was entertaining, for all its flaws. But I hope that if they make a Spider-Man IV, they'll avoid repeating the mistakes of this installment.</p></body></html>

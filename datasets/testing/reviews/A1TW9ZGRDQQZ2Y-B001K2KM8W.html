All the fantastic sets and CGI are top notch, as are all the actors. The Captain in this film is the meanest dude put on film in years. He is in my opinion the scariest monster in the movie (sorry Pale Man). This film is very dark, gruesome, and even hard to watch at times, but if you are in the mood for a fairy tale told like the old Grimm stories your in for a treat.<br /><br />This is truly one of the best films I have seen in some time. Oh, by the way, this film is in spanish and you will have to read. Some people in my theater didn't know this and complained for the first five minutes of the movie. This film could have been in english because all the actors speak it very good (I watched the HBO special). I sometimes felt I was missing the visuals because my eyes were focused on all the written dialogue. Anyways, I was lucky my theater got this movie so soon. Keep an eye out for it in your neck of the woods.</p></body></html>

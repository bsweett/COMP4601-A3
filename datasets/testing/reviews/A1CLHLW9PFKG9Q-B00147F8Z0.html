<meta name="summary" content="Too Dark - Can't See Anything"></head><body><p>Okay, first of all this movie is rated R, it's a horror movie, and it's based on 7 previous films (6 of them were full of blood, violence, and language). This means: blood, language, violence will be the highlight of Aliens vs Predator: Requiem.<br /><br />After the first AvP came out with a rating of PG-13, many fans felt cheated. They wanted to see the gore they had come to love and expect whenever the predators showed up to collect some skulls.<br /><br />The cast is made up unknowns so I won't even attempt to give them any kind of recognition. (see later in this post why*)<br /><br />AvP 2 picks up right where AvP left off. There's a predator who has an alien inside it. The alien bursts out of the predator while it flies off into space. This alien happens to be a hybrid of Alien and Predator. An attack follows and the ship crashes back on earth.<br /><br />Elsewhere, on the predator homeworld, a buddy locates the downed ship and travels to earth to "clean up" the mess.<br /><br />We now have aliens running amok in a small town and a predator trying to fix everything.<br /><br />*Basically, the humans are in this movie to provide the deaths. Heads explode, faces dissolve, arms get blown off, people get impaled against the wall. You can understand that this movie is ultra violent.<br /><br />The sad part is that this movie, nor the first one, live up to the original Alien and Predator movies.<br /><br />Too much stuff to keep most people away from this movie, but then again, it is rated R for a reason.</p></body></html>

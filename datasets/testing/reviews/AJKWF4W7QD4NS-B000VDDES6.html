<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly funny"></head><body><p>I hadn't expected much from Anchorman, but prepare to be pleasently surprised at just how funny the film is.  Will Ferrell is deadpan as Ron Burgundy, a TV newscaster on top of the world with his news team (including Paul Rudd, David Koechner, and the Daily Show's Steve Carell), and soon finds himself at odds with a tenacious female newscaster (Christina Applegate) who is looking to make it big, even if it comes at Ron's expense.  While some of the gags fall flat at times, the film for the most part is a joy, and the viewer is able to tell that the cast is having great fun which makes this even more enjoyable.  Anchorman for the most part is a surprisingly funny mainstream flick that fans of Ferrell will no doubt enjoy, and cameo roles from Vince Vaughn, Tim Robbins, Jack Black, Luke Wilson, and Ben Stiller will have you grinning from ear to ear.</p></body></html>

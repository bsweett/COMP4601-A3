<meta name="summary" content="Darn Glad I Have This Video"></head><body><p>I got hundreds of 'em.  VHS tapes, collected over the years when VHS was cool.  I was digging through them the other day and, to my delight and surprise, rediscovered THE TERMINATOR, a great action thriller that put director James Cameron and &quot;Ahnold&quot; on the superstar map.  <p>Schwarzenegger is absolutely perfect as an unemotional cyborg that travels back in time to 1984 to &quot;terminate&quot; a young woman (Linda Hamilton) destined to give birth to a man who ultimately will lead humans against the machines of the 21st Century.  Arnold brings his &quot;A&quot; game to this role, effectively portraying a brutal, stoic, ruthless killing machine that will stop at nothing to achieve its mission.  Hamilton as the constantly running victim is very good at screaming and looking terrified, while Michael Biehn is solid as her futuristic &quot;protector.&quot;<p>As entertaining as this movie is, the special effects are dated and quite laughable by today's standards.  Equally as laughable are the hairstyles, including a brief appearance by a spike-haired Bill Paxton.  Yet the flaws are overcome by the action and nonstop thrills, as Cameron showed the world he is a filmmaker to be reckoned with.  And I reckon I'm darn glad to have THE TERMINATOR in my video collection.<br />--D. Mikels</p></body></html>

Absolutely!"></head><body><p>I missed What Lies Beneath when it first arrived in theaters, and because of some negative press, as well as the comments of some friends, I expected the worst when I popped the movie into my player. I wound up having a lot of fun with this big budget, old-fashioned thriller which is designed solely to entertain. I suspect that many of those who were disappointed by it felt that, because it has such a famous and talented director and cast, it should have served some higher purpose. Or it could be that their plot hole threshold is lower than mine, for it is true that a lot of what goes on in the movie isn't all that believable. Still, part of what drives great movie making is, frankly, the ability either to rise above or to gloss over any script deficiencies, and I think the film mainly succeeds in doing this. It has been said that What Lies Beneath became a huge hit just because it came out at time when there was little product out for adult audiences, yet it could not have become such a success if a lot of people hadn't enjoy it.<p>Claire and Norman Spencer seem to be a very happily married couple. He is a successful doctor doing genetic research at a prestigious university in Vermont. She is a musician who seemingly put aside a promising career in order to be the perfect wife and mother. When the couple's only daughter goes off the college, Claire is left alone much of the time in their magnificent lakeside home. Her husband and her friends are worried about her for reasons that become clear later on. It turns out that they have cause to be concerned, for soon she begins to have some frightening hallucinations about a young woman who appears to be dead. When the woman next-door disappears, Claire becomes convinced that she has been murdered and begins to investigate the woman's husband. Norman becomes increasingly concerned and frightened by Claire's behavior. This is only the beginning of a mystery that takes the audience on a wild ride that questions what is real and what isn't. Are the things Claire sees real or things she imagines? Does she really see a ghost or is it a demon inside her trying to reveal a terrible truth? <p>Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford are perfect as Claire and Norman. This role is a welcome departure, as well as a good career move, for Mr. Ford, but it is basically Ms. Pfeiffer's movie. She has never been more beautiful nor vulnerable. In the hands of a lesser actress, Claire might have come off as laughingly neurotic, but Ms. Pfeiffer magically turns her into someone we can both relate to and root for. It's a role that's tougher than it looks, and the star makes the most of it. <p>What Lies Beneath is beautifully visualized. It is full of water imagery, water which at times acts as a force to hide the truth and, at another times, as a mirror to reflect it. This imagery doesn't make the movie any deeper, but it does make it lovely to look at. <p>This picture recalls some of the work of Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcock was the master of suspense, and, while What Lies Beneath in no way equals the best of his movies, it shares with them the idea that the ultimate goal of any good thriller is to entertain its audience. And for me, this movie did that. I suspect that some, but not all, of the criticism this movie has received may be based on a bit of intellectual snobbery. It is certainly not a work of art, but the great magic of cinema is that it can produce an infinate variety of movies. There is room in this world for all of them, and I for one like it that way, because a steady diet of any one particular type would soon become stale.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Australian style senseless killer"></head><body><p>I was compelled to see this movie because it is based on the true story.  Set in Australia, story follows three young people who decide to take a cross country trip in an old, used car.  They are carefree, not particularly ambitious, just seekign some fun and each other's company.<br /><br />The best part of the film is the shots of the Wolf Creek National Park that features meteorite site that is magnificent in both appearance and size.  The hike trip alone can take three hours and as it happens this seems to be a perfect pick up site of unsuspecting tourists for the serial killer.  This is not an everage killer.  He likes to torture his victims before killing them.  On the outside, he seems harmless, but there is something sinister in his laugh and amiable demeanor.<br /><br />As these young people experience car trouble and accept the offer from the local to get their car fixed (with no fee and no strings attached - how naive someone has to be to figure out that something is up?).  Before long, they are in for a gruesome experience.<br /><br />If it was not for the meterorite visuals inthis film I would have felt that I have wasted two hours of my life on this less than average movie.</p></body></html>

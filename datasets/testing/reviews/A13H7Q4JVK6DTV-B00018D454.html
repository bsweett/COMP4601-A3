<meta name="summary" content="Another Great Horror Flick"></head><body><p>This is not the same as the 1974 version but I still think it's great because it's a little different then the original and more updated.A couple of young adults go down to texas to see a concert but they pick up a hitchiker and things start to go crazy the kids get cut up and mess up and is worth a look at I can't say how but you'll be scare and entertain at what you see.</p></body></html>

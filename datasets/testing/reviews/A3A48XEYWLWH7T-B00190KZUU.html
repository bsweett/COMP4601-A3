Snippets of the life and times of the main character when played by Ewan McGregor are much more enjoyable than watching the bulbous Albert Finney `flounder' about in the present day incarnation.  The luminous Jessica Lang languishes in the role of the wife in present day, standing by as a prop while the dispassionately played son tries to synthesize reality and his father's tall tales fed him over the years.  An odd film, and not his usual quirky special way, it just didn't work for me.</p></body></html>

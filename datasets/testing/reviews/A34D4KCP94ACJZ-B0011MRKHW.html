She is also regarded as among the most beloved as well.  To create a lush and dramatic series of films about her long and storied rule is by no means unexpected, nor is it very original as the amount of on-screen interpretations of Elizabeth directly reflects the fascination we have in pondering the meaning of her reign.  Elizabeth:  The Golden Age is Shekhar Kapur's sequel to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RF7XYO">Elizabeth</a>, a film that introduced us to the famous queen and showed us the first part of her reign.  It's funny, I've been watching Showtime's the The Tudors and the most recent episodes have shown us Elizabeth's birth and even a little bit about Mary I, the queen that proceeded her and the daughter of Catherine of Aragon .  Given the nature of the hedonistic protagonists Anne Bolyn and King Henry VIII on that show and its positive portrayal of victimized Catholics such as Saint Thomas More, it was quite refreshing to see the Catholic Church in the interrogation room once again, perhaps where it belongs.  Anyway, the significance in the quasi-history portrayed on both this film and that show compliment each other quite nicely as Spain during the second half of Elizabeth's rule was an absolute god-fearing behemoth and a force to be reckoned with.  Some people have said this film is Anti-Catholic but really, these are the days of the inquisition we're watching.  It might be a task to stay balanced.<br /><br />Elizabeth is fundamentally very easy to sympathize with, after all it isn't really her fault her father was a pervert and her mother his mistress.  Nevertheless, Cate Blanchett has so much range that her performance quietly shows us her less obvious flaws.  I'm convinced that no other actress could portray this queen in a way that justifies her reputation.  The cast is actually great even beyond her though, which is not unlike the first film.  Walter Raleigh is played by Clive Owen, Geoffrey Rush is Francis Walsingham and Mary, Queen of Scots is played with great villainy by Samantha Morton.  The film follows the Battle of Gravelines in the Anglo-Spanish War as it's primary battle scene but most of the film is focused on the amazing costumes, music, and sets.  It also ponders Elizabeth's interpersonal relationships.<br /><br />There are massive historical inaccuracies that are for the most part done to heighten drama but some are pretty inexplicable (where the hell was Robert Cecil?).  I guess the inaccuracies would be inconsequential if I didn't also believe that 99% of the audience would see The Golden Age as their only reference to the virgin queen.  I'm not so sure I can forgive that but I know many viewers will.  Elizabeth's famous speech to the troops at Tilbury before the invasion of the Spanish Armada is widely documented but for those who don't know it is regarded as fact, the scene comes off as derivative of just about every Hollywood epic period film made in the last twenty years.  Blanchett is not at fault but her plate armor and lack of femininity in the way the scene is directed actually brought back the long forgotten memories of Milla Jovovich's speech as Joan of Arc in the pathetically amateur Luc Besson film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767845722">The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc</a>.  That isn't to say The Golden Age is as bad a film, it is not.  It captures the magic expected of a portrayal of this leader in flashes but misses the opportunity to capture her most significant speech.  They actually blew it.<br /><br />Anyway, very good looking film with some really great acting, but take heed; the history buffs might take issue with the accuracy, while the movie buffs might mistakenly walk out thinking they've learned something.  I'd like to consider myself a little bit of both so consider this a mixed review leaning toward a partial recommendation for the visuals and performances.</p></body></html>

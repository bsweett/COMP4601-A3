By now everyone knows the story (or at least the first two thirds of the story) and while 'yet another film about boxing' may have kept some viewers away from this movie originally, the recent controversy about the last third of the film's message should certainly breakdown the resistance of the remaining population.  This is a film that should almost be required viewing - on many levels.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood deserves all the kudos mounting around his direction and acting and courage to put this compilation of stories by FX Toole as written for the screen by Paul Haggis on celluloid.  Eastwood's "look" (color made to seem almost black and white by his choices of strong light and shadow throughout) fits this microcosm of the down and out in the dregs of Los Angeles gyms and allows the redemptive powers of the individual soul to gleam.<br /><br />As Frankie Dunn, Eastwood is an old has been boxing trainer who lives a quiet life in his rundown gym writing to his long lost daughter (his letters are always returned unopened), attending mass trying to make sense of an irrational universe, and supporting young wannabe boxers, afraid to take them to the 'big fight'.  He is aided by an old one-eyed boxer custodian, his longtime friend Scrap Iron (Morgan Freeman). Into this milieu steps Maggie (Hilary Swank), a trailer park trash 31 year old waitress who has placed all her dreams of rising out of her status by having Frankie train her to be a prize fighting boxer.  Frankie refuses, Maggie is quietly persistent, and Scrap is supportive,  until events occur that result in his taking Maggie on as a  boxer.<br /><br />From that point Maggie and Frankie and Scrap form a warm trio of hope and work and Maggie slowly and surprisingly quickly is readied for a big fight.  The outcome of that fight changes all the characters, but those changes, as devastating as they are, open doors of redemption.  This journey out of meaningless existence into the aura of human compassion is magnificently written, acted, molded and photographed and is destined to be film footage that burns its impression onto the minds of every person who experiences this film.  Saying more is unnecessary.<br /><br />Grady Harp, February 2005</p></body></html>

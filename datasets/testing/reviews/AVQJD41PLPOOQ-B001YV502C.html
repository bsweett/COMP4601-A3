<meta name="summary" content=""Blade Runner" for the 21st Century???"></head><body><p>That's what some bonehead film critic actually said about this dud!  Are you kidding me???<br /><br />The basic story is intruiging enough - In the year 2027, a disease of infertility has overcome the planet and there hasn't been a child born in eighteen years; that is, until a young pregnant woman is discovered and she must be protected at all costs.<br /><br />Like I said, interesting premise, but we are offered no history or explanation as to how and why the world ended up like this in the first place.  This is absolutely infuriating when the entire film is based on this premise.  The apocolyptic state of Britian in the future and the way it is filmed is hardly original or impressive either.  One need only watch 12 MONKEYS, V FOR VENDETTA, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK or even A CLOCKWORK ORANGE to see where the original ideas came from.<br /><br />And finally, as for the critic's opinion that CHILDREN OF MEN is "Blade Runner for the 21st Century"...what exactly was this person smoking when they said that??  To even come close to the genius of BLADE RUNNER, there would have to be some special effects which depict a city of the future.  There are none.  In the future, Britian is nothing more that a huge pile of garbage!<br /><br />One positive note I can make about this film is its homage to classic rock!  A cover version of The Rolling Stones "Ruby Tuesday" and the original version of King Crimson's "In The Court Of The Crimson King" are played.  And in a scene between Clive Owen and Michael Caine, there is a background behind them which clearly pays tribute to the album cover of Pink Floyd's "Animals".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Funny, Touching, Human Tale"></head><body><p>Can a film about an embittered wife - whose husband left her to head to Sweden with his secretary - make for interesting watching, and not seem like a chick-flick or invite opportunities for male-bashing? Surprisingly the answer is "yes".<br /><br />Meet Mrs. Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen), a woman on the edge. Her husband's run off with the office slut (or so she thinks) and now she's left to finish off raising their almost-adult daughters. Add to this a drinking, washed-up, baseball hall-of-famer who lives nearby and is "interested" in her, and you've created an entirely new layer.<br /><br />Mrs. Wolfmeyer is forced to battle alcoholism, parental duties related to sex and relationships, and, most destructively, her own anger. She pushes away all those whom she loves, and does so via some hilarious film making. For instance, there's a scene where she's at a restaurant table and has just discovered that her eldest daughter (who's in college) is pregnant and getting married. She meets her future son-in-law's parents and proposes a toast, at which time she drains her bloody mary. Then, when she sits, she raises her glass again to signal to a waiter that she needs another, and everyone thinks she's making another toast, so they raise their glasses again. Extremely funny moments like this punctuate what could have been a drab and dreary movie.<br /><br />Kevin Costner pulls off his best roll to date, creating a deep and equally shallow man all wrapped in one. His on-screen persona was so much different than anything I'd ever seen him play before. I'd dare say that this is my favorite Costner performance.<br /><br />The film pulls you not-so-gently into these people's lives and makes us live with them during their best and worst times (sometimes it's difficult to tell when you're in a "best time" versus a "worst time", too.)<br /><br />The ending was definitely a shocker; something that came out of the blue and plowed into me. A pleasant surprise.<br /><br />The only issues some might have with the movie is that it has no action. There's no battle scenes or fight sequences. It's a human tale with real people living out real problems. If you enjoyed such films as THE SHIPPING NEWS and the like, you'll probably enjoy this one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Now raise your goblet of rock. It's a toast to those who rock!"></head><body><p>I finally got the chance to see this movie on Saturday with a friend of mine. Personally, I thought it was hilarious. I enjoyed it tremendously. Jack Black confirmed his "God" status yet again to me. I think this was his best movie yet. Giving Jack Black a starring role in a movie about rock music was the single best decision made by Hollywood in 2003. Needless to say, I was stunned, and even after the movie was done, I stayed and watched the end credits sequence. The reason this movie worked was because although it was aimed primarily at children, it was *NOT* a kid's movie: it was a FAMILY movie. That is, everybody, young and old, male and female, smart and stupid, could enjoy it. If you were a kid, you got some funny physical humor with nary a flatulence joke in sight (thank GOD)! If you were an adult, you got some funny subtle music references. And the peculiar thing is this, my friends: this movie worked on multiple levels. If you wanted just straight-forward, good-natured comedy, you got it. If you wanted an inspirational story that sends a good message to kids, you sure got it. If you wanted a movie that kicks MTV in the face and glorifies REAL rock music, you definitely got it. This movie is about a lot of things, and it isn't preachy or heavy-handed, nor does it have stupid plot twists (I was very happy that one of the kids didn't end up with cancer or break their arms or something). I was surpremely enthralled with this movie, and I bow down at the altar of Jack Black, for bestowing his glory upon yet another quality work of cinema. The only gripe I have is that it would have been nice to see just a *little* more tension between the kids' parents and Jack Black, especially towards the end, but hey, it was still a great movie.</p></body></html>

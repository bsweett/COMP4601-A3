I'm not sure.  I guess that depends on your opinion of homophobic jokes.<br /><br />Four middle-aged men with aspirations of gnarliness decide to de-tame their adequate (but unexciting) lives with an old-fashioned bike trip.  Doug (Tim Allen) is a dentist on a diet.  Bobby (Martin Lawrence) is a writer/plumber who is whipped by every female in his family.  Woody (John Travolta), once wealthy, now finds himself broke and dumped.  And Dudley (William H. Macy) is a painfully nerdy computer programmer who is smart enough to install voice-recognition software in his laptop, but not smart enough to figure out how to turn his computer off when it starts to belt out embarrasing website names in the middle of a coffee shop.<br /><br />How on Earth did these four men ever become friends?  Who cares?  Certainly not the script.  It's too busy hauling out old sitcom cliches and cheesy character foibles to ever consider things like back stories or, say, plausibility.<br /><br />The men eventually meet a "real" gang of bikers, the Del Fuegos, led by Jack (Ray Liotta, in the only decent role of the film), and of course they go head-to-head.  Caught in the middle is the small, arid town of Madrid, where the sherrifs get their training by playing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006A5IWE">Doom 3</a> and the waitresses look like Marisa Tomei.<br /><br />Wait a minute.  That IS Marisa Tomei.  And guess which of our hapless heroes she falls in love with for no apparant reason whatsoever?  The answer is less interesting than you might think.<br /><br />And so is the film.  It has its moments (Macy's bumbling dope gets a few good lines, and Lawrence manages to be funny without saying much at all), but those moments are fleeting.  The rest of the film is paint-by-numbers comedy, a bad mixture of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001I55VU">Boy Meets World</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000022TSY">Easy Rider</a>.  If you like guys on bikes accidentally clotheslining themselves on street signs, you'll probably enjoy the rest of the jokes this flick has to offer.  If you ask me, though, "Wild Hogs" could've used a lot less ham, and a lot more wild.</p></body></html>

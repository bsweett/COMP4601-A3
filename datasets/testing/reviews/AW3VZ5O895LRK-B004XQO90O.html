<meta name="summary" content="3.5 for me; might be higher for action adventure sci-fi maven"></head><body><p>This combo genre of action adventure melded to sci fi is popular at the box office. I think I prefer it when the film is solidly one or the other. It is VERY plot driven. The main character, a captain with possibly a sci fi fleet, keeps repeating the same event over and over involving a train which is blown up by a mad bomber.  Jake G plays the captain and he is quite good. He carries the whole movie, virtually every frame.<br /><br />This reminds me of the German film RUN LOLA RUN by Tom Twyker. He had Lola repeating the same event again and again with the end result of her ending up dead or her boyfriend or both.  She keeps redoing the sequence of events so that she can get them to both live. However, there is no "state" or army involved, no bombing event and no controlling force.  We never know what caused Lola to live this sequence again and again.  That was a 5 star film for me but Twyker did it first.  If you liked this movie, you will love the Twyker one.</p></body></html>

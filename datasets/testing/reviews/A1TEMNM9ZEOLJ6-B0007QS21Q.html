<meta name="summary" content="Will Smith's tiring schtick"></head><body><p>He plays the only guy in the movie with any common sense, and is thus very unrealistic. Also, his urban black hip dude schtick grows very wearisome. The special effects are just ok. The plot involves some nonsense about robots taking over the world. It's only set 25 years in the future. A bit of a stretch if this is what the world is really coming to.</p></body></html>

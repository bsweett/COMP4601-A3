He is led by a voice that told him to find the last copy of the Bible and to bring it West. Along this treacherous path he encounters hijackers, cannibals and a Warlord named Carnegie (Oldman). The book, Carnegie believes is a weapon that strikes at the heart of man. It will give him the words he needs to control them and expand his power. Eli will stop at nothing to protect the book and bring it to where man still has hope! The forces of good and evil clash again over the oldest story ever told.<br /><br />The story is effective and the acting is great. Washington is so believable in his roles, which is only further complimented by Oldman. Suprisingly Kunis does a good job as Solara! The story is fluid and poignant. I was interested from start to finish. I strongly recommend a viewing.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: A strong transfer, although the colors are muted intentionally to advance the feel of a post apocalyse world. A strong audio mix really let's out the BOOM! SPECIAL FEATURES: An excellent array of extras here that provide insight to the storyline and making of. FINAL VERDICT: WORTHY OF OWNERSHIP</p></body></html>

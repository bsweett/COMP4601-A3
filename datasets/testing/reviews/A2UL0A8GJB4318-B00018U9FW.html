<meta name="summary" content=""I Love the School Of Rock!""></head><body><p>What intially drwas you into to "School of Rock," is Mr. Blacks' insane, twisted, but always in some crazy way witty and funny brand of comedy, "School of Rock" is a rocking, rollicking and wholly enjoyable formula movie.  It has fun with the history of rock, its cliches, and even race, privilege and mone all at the same time.  Black plays a down on his luck rocker named Dewey, who poses as his best friend to be a substitute teacher at a posh private school, filled with kids who know more about Handel than Hendrix.  Dewey changes all of that by making his class believe that there is a state-wide project that involves all schools to form a rock band and battle it out.  <p>And the kids Dewey meets along the way all turn out to be gifted musicians, as well as fodder for some of the funniest comedy to come along this year.  His band is made up of an Asian (on piano), African-Americans (back-up singers), and stiff white guys (on guitar and drums).  But the "School of Rock" has a sweetness and a genuine nature about it that transends race and heritage, not to mention the kids in the movie are immensely talented.  The child actors (those who had to) learned to play their instruments, and they do a damn good job too.  Black once said in an interview that he was kind of embarrased to be surrounded with kids who were better musicians than he was.  But Black really shines in sequences where director Richard Linklater lets Black cut loose, trashing MTV, poking fun at Einsteins Theory of Relativity and letting ad lib the a scene that coincides with the closing credits.  <p>While its still in theatres, treat yourself to ...<p>  "THE SCHOOL OF ROCK!"</p></body></html>

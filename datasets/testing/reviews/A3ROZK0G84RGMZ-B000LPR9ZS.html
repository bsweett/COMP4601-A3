I must admit Saw III has many gross bloody moments with great torture devices but it was so rushed to get to the end that they forgot to let us get to know any of the characters.  These movies have made enough money to get some better known actors haven't they?  Perhaps familiar faces would help the audience connect to the characters more.  Or better writing too.  In Saw III we get what is expected.  More games, more sick twisted scenes, and we also get a surprise at the end of the movie that for me was worth giving the film four stars.  Overall I am satisfied with how this third installment tied all three movies together especially with the two lead charcters Jigsaw and Amanda.</p></body></html>

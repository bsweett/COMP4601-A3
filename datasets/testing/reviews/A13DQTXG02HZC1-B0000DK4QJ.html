I started to make assumption that the once great director has gone soft, and that he had run out of ideas of producing & directing great classics that we have had come to watch since toddlers.  Naturally, I went to the cinema with great trepidation.  Anyhow, I wasn't disappointed at all.  Whilst Jurassic Park, ET, Indiana Jones Trilogy were catering more for the family audience, this movie is definitely targeted at a more matured audience.  It entertained and provoked us at the same time by offering gray scenarios, asking questions like how are we to trust the system when it is not necessarily perfect and that there are loopholes to be explored, and how are we to trust the system if the integrity of the enforcers is dubious, to say the least.  In some ways, I am feeling apologetic for Tom Cruise because he can actually act and look good at the same time.  Just hope that this doesn't limit his range somewhat.  Furthermore, for an Oscar veteran, Max von Sydow, Colin Farrell (from Tigerland), even the 'Eugene Young' character from TV series, The Practice, & even the gray hair fellow from 'The Band of Brothers', this movie is well supported.  But the final compliment must go to none other than Steven Spielberg for his vision in creating a grand spectacle of what future might look like.  Lexus is featured prominently in this movie throughout, and one can't help wondering if soft sponsorship occured in this instance.  Highly recommended.  My trust in Steven Spielberg prevails!</p></body></html>

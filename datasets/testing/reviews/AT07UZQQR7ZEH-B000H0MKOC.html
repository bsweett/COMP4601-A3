<meta name="summary" content="A hilarious satire with a great cast"></head><body><p>The most surprising and refreshing thing about writer/director Jason Reitman's THANK YOU FOR SMOKING is that no one smokes--not tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor, not the alcohol and guns lobbyists, not the investigative reporter, and certainly not the Vermont cheese senator.<br /><br />This is a nutty and witty comedy satire that reminded me fondly of the 1940's Preston Sturges comedies, with their zany dialogue and flawless supporting casts.  SMOKING's key character, Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart in the performance of his career to date), is a tobacco lobbyist who is sympathetic.  Divorced, with a 12 year old son he tries to be a great role model for, Naylor believes that Americans have the right to smoke and the right to choose whether or not they will.  He knows he manufactures a product that causes death, but he can be wickedly hilarious about it.  Like with Cancer Boy on THE JOAN LUNDEN SHOW:  "Why would I want this young boy to die?  We would lose one more potential adult smoker."  Then he invades an elementary school classroom, where one little girl tells him, "My Mommy says that cigarettes can kill you."  "Oh?  Is your Mommy a doctor?  A scientific researcher?  Then maybe she doesn't have all the facts."  This is a hysterically funny and inspired satire.<br /><br />Curiously, the villain of the piece may be William H. Macy as the unpleasant Vermont Senator who sells "cheese that creates fatty arteries and heart attacks," replies Nick.  Nick also has a reporter (DAWSON CREEK's Katie Holmes) want to do a story on him; the two end up as literally strange bedfellows.  Meanwhile, the head of the Tobacco Lobby, Robert Duvall, dies of lung cancer.  And the alcohol and gun control lobbyists keep fighting for Americans' rights to drink and fire guns, hopefully not at the same time.<br /><br />The source here is a novel by Christopher Buckley and it must be a lulu.  It would be fun to know whether or not Mr. Buckley smokes.  I am a lifelong non-smoker with asthma.  Nick Naylor would probably say to me that it is my right and choice not to smoke, knowing the dangers of cigarettes.  The movie makes such a complex case for both sides, which is a tribute to director Reitman's brilliant screenplay.  One wishes both it and Eckhart's fabulous performance could be Oscar nominees next Spring for this 2006 comedy delight.  But the whole cast is a dream--Macy, Holmes, Duvall, Maria Bello, Adam Brody; and the dialogue is brilliant.  If you want a good time at the movies, don't even consider missing the wonderfully funny THANK YOU FOR SMOKING on DVD.<br /><br />The movie is in Panavision and letterboxed on DVD.  Bonuses include a superb CHARLIE ROSE SHOW with Buckley, Reitman, Eckhart, and producer David O. Sacks; an audio commentary I do not recommend until a second viewing of the movie; two filmmaking featurettes; and deleted scenes with filmmaker commentary.</p></body></html>

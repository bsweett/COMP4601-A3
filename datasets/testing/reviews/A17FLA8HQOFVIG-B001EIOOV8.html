<meta name="summary" content="Great story about the mob, love, money and corruption.  I loved every minute of it!"></head><body><p>I saw Casino when it first came out in 1995.  I loved the story, the acting and the violence.  It was on TV a few days ago.  Nothing else interested me at the time so I thought I'd just watch a few scenes.  After all, I had seen the film before and there were a lot of nasty commercial breaks to deal with.  Well, two hours later when it ended I was still sitting in my chair, the remote control still in my hand and I hadn't even channel surfed one bit during the commercials.  Without a doubt I was completely pulled right into the story, based on some real life people and events.  The fact that I had seen this film before didn't matter at all.<br /><br />The setting is Las Vegas.  The story is about the mob and based on some real events.  Martin Scorcese's direction keeps the action flowing.  The relationship between the stars, Robert DeNiro and Sharon Stone, sizzles.  And the musical score enhances the action and keeps the story upbeat, sad and violent all at the same time.  Joe Pesci is cast as a bad guy you love to hate.  His cruelty is awful, and yet I couldn't help but feel sorry for him when he, too, became a victim of the gang world which he helped create.<br /><br />The story of love and money and corruption is a universal one.  There's not a bit of this film that felt dated.  I loved every moment of it.  And, even if you've seen it before, it's worth a second look.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

I can say that this re-make is one heck of a fun ride from start to finish. It's a real balls to the wall horror film filled to the brim with blood, guts, gore, guns, and explosions. I haven't seen a bloody good time film like this in a long time. The plot is pretty simple and to the point. Some kind of outbreak has the citixens of Everett, Wisconsin turning into cannibalistic zombies wreaking havoc on the town and feeding on human flesh. If you get bit, you are infected. It will only be a matter of time before you are one of them. A small band of survivors from this outbreak get together and take refuge in a shopping mall. The survivors is led by the beautiful Sarah Polley, who plays Anna, a nurse. Ving Rhames plays Kenneth, a tough cop. Jake Weber plays Michael, a TV salesman, and "ER" actor Mekhi Pfifer is also included. The band of survivors must fend off the intruding zombies and figure out a way to stay alive.  The action pretty much gets going within the first few minutes. It just starts and never stops. The survivors are in the mall within 10 minutes of the movie's start. I like how the movie is shown very normally in the beginning. Anna going home to a perfect, idyllic suburban neighborhood, and then all this breaks loose. The film has a major advantage by having a tremendous, above average cast. Indie darling Polley, and Rhames. Polley is definitley a welcome addition to the horror heroine fold and she definitley holds her own. She's smart, brave, and tough. One of the best heroines to come along in a while. Rhames is a man and actor of incredible presence and intensity. He's perfect in the role of Kenneth. The others are just as good. Character actor Matt Frewer briefly pops up, looking sickly even before he gets sick!. Also expect cameos by make-up genius Tom Savini and original star Ken Foree as well. On an interesting note, Lindy Booth who plays Nicole, and Kevin Zegers who plays security guard Terry, played an ill fated couple in the horror flick, "Wrong Turn". The make-up and gore is zombie-tastic, courtesy of David Anderson(Heather Langenkamp's husband). There is enough death, blood squirting, and heads exploding by bulletts to please all gorehounds. The script is sharp and tight and the characters, thanks to the performers, are all pretty well rounded and formed. There are the typical types of people you would expect to find in such a film in such a situation. The sarcastic jerk, the creep everyone wants to get it, and so on. But what would it be without it and the ensuing conflict that it delivers?. The dialogue is solid and realistic, and it, and the direction, keeps everything moving right along at a frentic, hair-raising pace. I hear about the social commentary used in the first film, but this one seems to not pick up on it much.  There are nice bits of humor here and there, but not enough to make it a laugh type film. The humor is real and comes out of the situations. Like the instrumental muzak version of "Don't Worry Be Happy" playing over the monitor when they first get into the mall. There's more like that. I should have seen the original first, to compare better, but I really don't like doing so. No one is going to think much of a re-make of their favorite movie no matter what. All I can say is that this is a rip roaring film. A real bloody good time.</p></body></html>

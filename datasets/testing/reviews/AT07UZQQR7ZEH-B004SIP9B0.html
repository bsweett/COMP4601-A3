The movie has played for months on end in San Francisco art theaters, but never once reached my local suburb, so it probably also never played in small towns across America.  That was my key, along with friends wanting MY personal take on this Best Picture Oscar nominee and Actress winner when it FINALLY got onto DVD.<br /><br />For starters, Helen Mirren gives one of the great performances of all time and richly deserved the thousand awards she has gotten as Queen Elizabeth II.  But she could not do much if Peter Morgan's award-winning script were not as brilliant as it is; the same goes for Frears' magnificent direction.  The movie got Oscar-nominated in several major categories, including Picture and Direction and Actress; I would have added Production Design.  On a mediocre audio commentary, Frears and Morgan curiously ridicule and bad-mouth their own movie in terms of jokes and wrong locations because of a low-budget.  Actually, this is a very handsome-looking film in terms of sets and costumes.  So when you play this DVD, do ignore the Morgan and Frears audio commentary, and maybe try a second one with a British historian and royal family author.  Or just listen to the movie "cold".<br /><br />What we have here is a fascinating and insightful drama about the week following Princess Diana's car crash death in 1997 Paris, as filtered through the perspective of the Royal family who are at Balmoral, their hideaway in the Scottish highlands (rich location filming).  Morgan's screenplay gives us a day-by-day portrait of the conflict between the Monarchs and the Blairs, Queen Elizabeth and Prime Minister Tony Blair (a marvelous Michael Sheen), fresh young blood versus a centuries-old conservative monarchy.  We observe, like flies on a wall, how the death of Diana is viewed by both the Queen and Tony.  The Blairs side with the British public, who adored Diana.  They want the flag over Buckingham Palace flown at half-mast, even though the Royal family is in Scotland for the week, and they want a public statement from the Queen.  As more and more flowers pile up outside Buckingham Palace, where people are holding a vigil all week and impatiently waiting for their queen to show herself, Elizabeth reads the various newspapers criticizing her.  She did not like Diana that much and views this as very much a private funeral.  THE QUEEN is rich in character more than plot.<br /><br />Eventually, the public gets its wish for a flag at half-mast, a public TV statement by a queen who barely feels and coldly recites the words she is saying, and a walk among the thousands of people behind police barriers.  The loveliest scene, or at least my favorite, has a little girl giving the Queen a bouquet of flowers.  "For me?" she inquires softly.  "Thank you," she says with true sympathy.  Mirren is just towering and flawless in her Oscar-winning role, reason enough to watch THE QUEEN.  But Sheen, and veteran Sylvia Sims and Oscar-nominee James Cromwell, are also excellent as the Queen Mother and Prince Philip, respectively.  The movie should also have gotten a Makeup Oscar nomination since Mirren is beautiful and sexy in real life and looks nothing like Elizabeth.  But with the right white wig and reading glasses and a soft accent, she IS the Queen.  (You might want to watch the film with the English subtitle captions turned on to catch all of the dialogue.)<br /><br />The DVD for THE QUEEN is letterboxed at 1.85, middle-range wide-screen.  (There is also a pan/scan full screen version.)  Like I said earlier, it has two audio commentaries, and the one I played with the director and writer does the movie a real disservice by constantly pointing out all its flaws.  But there is also a very good and informative 20 minute filmmaking documentary and chat with the cast.  It got a PG-13 rating for "brief language" which bypassed me; I'd give the film a "PG" instead for all ages.  This could be a thrilling English history lesson supplement in high schools and colleges.  Happy viewing!</p></body></html>

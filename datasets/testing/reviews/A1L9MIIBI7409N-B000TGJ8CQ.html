<meta name="summary" content="Watchable Hollywood Cage Film - 3.5 stars"></head><body><p>NEXT certainly wasn't as bad as some critics made it out to be.  My local newspaper reviewer said the plot was convoluted - what rubbish!  This is one of the easiest films that one could watch.  Yes, the film could have been much darker and more complex.  Philip Dick the writer had a propensity for that - but of course, what we get is not a sci-fi film noir but a Nicholas Cage film.  I am a big Nicholas Cage fan, but I have to say that he no longer (if he did) has that dark edge.  He's almost cartoony - and his hair needs serious help.  Still, a good cast, a simple story - make this easy to follow.  Rent or buy it for entertainment.  Nicholas Cage's performances would be much better if someone could do a Sean Connery on him and fix his hair.  Seriously.</p></body></html>

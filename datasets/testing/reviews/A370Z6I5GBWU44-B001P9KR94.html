<meta name="summary" content="Awesome, depressing"></head><body><p>I can't give this movie enough praise. So much has been said by the other reviewers that I'm not going to bother with a tl;dr review. The acting and storytelling were superb, and I enjoyed this movie thoroughly.<br /><br />But it's also bleak and depressing, because this kind of thing - people living in these horrible slums, the blinding of children to increase their earning potential as beggars, the selling of girls, happens in real life.<br /><br />Mind you, these depressing parts don't make the movie worse or anything. They're a necessary part of the movie. If you want a good, serious, thought-provoking movie, pick this up! I'm glad I did!</p></body></html>

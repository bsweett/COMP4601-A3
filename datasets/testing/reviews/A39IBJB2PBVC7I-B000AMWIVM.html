<meta name="summary" content=""I Sawed The Best Minds Of My Generation""></head><body><p>This DVD comes in a very chic clear box, that's the good news - the bad news is everything else.  The real horror of Saw is watching a fine actor like Danny Glover damage his reputation by appearing in it - I would suggest that a much more interesting film could be made showing how a gentleman like Mr. Glover could be driven to such desperate ends.  After that, the most disturbing thing about Saw is the pretensions to intellectualism exhibited by its director, James Wan, and writer Leigh Whannell (who also acts like a person acting in the picture).<br /><br />These individuals have studied their betters carefully, combing through Se7en, Silence of the Lambs, and more obscure efforts like Deathtrap and Sleuth.  Indeed, if these two had any skill at all, they might have structured the film as a play and shot the whole thing in that filthy room with the two protagonists and alleged corpse. Unfortunately, they aren't clever; they just want you to believe they are.  What drives all four of those better films is fantastic characters whose obsessions and peculiarities are fascinating.  Saw offers us a women slitting open the belly of a man so that she can paw through his intestines in time to find the key that will save her from having her head split in half.  (Edward Albee eat your heart out!)<br /><br />Which brings us to Jigsaw, the mastermind behind these devious "hands-off" killings, orchestrated so ingeniously.  Just where do the Jigsaws of the world come from?  These psychopaths seem to have unlimited time and resources, whiling away the hours dreaming up imaginative tortures, leaving lots of cleverly encrypted clues, adding presentational flair and panache to their intricate delivery, and of course, spending countless hours on victim research and pre-planning diabolical snares.  How convenient for everyone!<br /><br />If you're a 14-year old boy and video games aren't violent enough for you, you will find something satisfying in Saw.  However, if you know better, but you just have a hankering for senseless gore and mayhem, spare yourself the pseudo-intellectualism and get High Tension instead.</p></body></html>

Charles was a world renowned explorer.  It was that love that lead him to Ellie, a girl who also idolized Charles.  The two eventually married.<br /><br />The years went by, and the two never did fulfill their life long dream of visiting Paradise Falls in South America.  Buy the time our story really begins, Carl (voiced now by Ed Asner) is a lonely old man.  The land around his house has been sold to a developer who seizes on one action by Carl to take away his house, too.<br /><br />The night before Carl has to leave, however, he seizes on an opportunity.  He blows up hundreds of helium balloons and sets out for South America.  He has a stowaway in the form of Russell (Jordan Nagai), a Wilderness Explorer looking to get his badge for helping the elderly.  Together, the two set out on a wild adventure that includes a giant bird and Dug, a talking dog (Bob Peterson).  Will they reach Paradise Falls?<br /><br />I've got to admit that the last couple of Pixar movies haven't been the homeruns I've come to expect from them.  This movie was perfect in every way, however.<br /><br />So let's get the negative out of the way first.  This movie is fairly predictable.  I guessed most of the major plot points for the first two thirds of the film not too far into it.  But, as always, the ride through those elements is absolutely wonderful.  And the movie features the return of Pixar's patented climax that will not quit.<br /><br />The movie expertly balances comedic and tender moments.  This is especially true when Dug shows up.  I can't stop laughing at his antics.  But a musical montage of Carl and Ellie's life together and the climax also moved me to tears.  Some have found it too serious, but I think the two are blended perfectly to present us with an uplifting message on the power of people who love us in our lives.<br /><br />Of course, they bring all this together with the perfect visuals.  Once again, there are some truly breathtaking moments.  I don't know how they keep topping themselves in this department, but they do every time.<br /><br />The movie is rated PG for mild peril related to a storm early on and elements of the climax.  I think only the easily frightened will have a problem with it.  Additionally, the movie does touch on death and divorce as it relates to our two main characters.  Frankly, I think both are handled well, but parents might want to be prepared to discuss that with their kids.<br /><br />This truly is an uplifting movie that will make you laugh and send leave you wanting to hug the ones you love.  I may just have a new Pixar favorite.</p></body></html>

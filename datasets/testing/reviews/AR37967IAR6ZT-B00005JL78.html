<meta name="summary" content="Great movie, blah special features disc."></head><body><p>&quot;Minority Report,&quot; which works as a mystery, a sci-fi film and a pretty damn exciting adventure film, one of the best films of 2002. It is, at different points, thrilling, creepy, funny, confusing and inspired. <p>The acting is great, for Tom Cruise, in some of the scenes mourning his son, escapes his usual bravado to show some of that talent he so rarely gets to show in an action film. Max von Sydow, Colin Farrell, Tim Blake Nelson, Samantha Morton and, particularly, the scene-stealing, brilliant Lois Smith also give compelling, supporting performances. <p>The plot is labyrinth, and the payoff is, for the most part, rewarding, though the ending could've been a bit less conventional. (Why, after such a wacky ride of a movie, are we left with a chase through the annals of a hotel? And what is with that ultra-happy ending? I hear there's a theory that part's all faked, but I think that theory's a result of some disappointed moviegoers.)<p>My main complaint with the DVD packaging is the extra supplemental disc. Why create a whole second disc and put so little compelling information on it? The documentary is, mostly, Cruise and Spielberg patting themselves and each other on the back. It doesn't delve too much into the actual crafting of the movie's plot or story. It just presents it, point blank, as &quot;We wanted to work together, and we found this script.&quot; The mechanics behind the film are inspired, and I wanted to know more. I wanted commentary tracks. I wanted how-to stories about the plausibility of the future gadgets. I got a 20-minute movie about how brilliant Spielberg is. I got a four-page essay on the film work of Tom Cruise, which I already knew about.<p>I love the movie. Give me the good stuff about it.</p></body></html>

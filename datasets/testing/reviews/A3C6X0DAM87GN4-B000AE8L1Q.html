There is an "upside" to anger. But I don't think the movie presents this idea in the most effective ways which is sad because the movie has so much promise.<br /><br /> The movie was made by first time writer\director Mike Bender. Bender, whom I think is talented, doesn't present these character is a realistic way. Allen and Costner, though at times quite wonderful to watch, seems to be too broad and cartoonish. The situations and characters seem to over-the-top. There is a level of sincerity missing.<br /><br /> The movie stars Joan Allen as Terry Wolfmeyer, who's husband has disappear, apparently he has gone to Sweden with his secretary and left behind his four daughts; Erika Christensen (Andy), Keri Russell (Emily), Evan Rachel Wood ("Popeye"), and Alice Witt (Hadley). The relationship between these people never hits a real note, and I should know since I currently leave in a house filled with women. My mother, two sisters, my grandmother and my aunt, beat that! Then there is Denny Davies (Costner) an ex ball player who host a radio show that refuses to talk about baseball. Soon Denny and Terry become drinking buddies, though we suspect Denny wants something more.<br /><br /> Despite all the film's flaws one has to admit Allen and Costner are likeable characters. Costner though needed this movie to come along. I can't think of the last decent film I've seen him in. After "Dances with Wolves" and "JFK" I don't know what happened to him. Allen on the other hand usual picks good roles. And her presents in this film makes us think of the much better "Ice Storm".<br /><br /> Now if Allen and Costner are the highpoints of the film then writer\director Mike Bender is the low point. What a terrible character he has written for himself. You would have thought given that he wrote the movie he might have given himself a better part. His character slows the movie down to a halt! He is not needed at all. The film could have gotten along fine without him. Bender, whom some may know as the star of a short lived HBO series "Mind of the Married Man" doesn't even do himself the service of playing a likeable jerk. If we could only see some good in his character with MIGHT put up with him, but there nothing there. I think the movie works best when Bender is offscreen.<br /><br /> I think if "The Upside of Anger" wouldn't have been so broad and try to define all of these characters a bit more this could have been a really great film. I remained only mildly entertained. I walked in with good intentions but very soon realized the movie wasn't going to live up to them.<br /><br /> The daughters in the film are played by some truly gifted young women. I'm a very big fan of Erika Christensen who after making the film "Traffic" hasn't quite been in anything as powerful as that film. It is though a nice recovery from "Swimfan" at the very least. And Evan Rachel Wood who was in "Thirteen" is fine in her role, but, I felt not used enough. I'm also a fan of Keri Russell's who I thought was great in "Felicity" though again her scenes with Allen don't quite hit home. I had difficulty buying what the movie was selling.<br /><br /> Overall I thik this is a harmless movie that people should see but just be warned a lot of the film's praise is slightly hyped. Also, for no apparent reason the film has a political bent. And I still don't understand what politics is doing in a movie like this.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Two wonderful performances given by Joan Allen and Kevin Costner save the film from becoming a dud. The movie doesn't quite seems real though. It's too broad and that hurts the movie from leaving much of an impression on us given the material.</p></body></html>

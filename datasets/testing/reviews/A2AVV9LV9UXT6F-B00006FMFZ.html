<meta name="summary" content="Good, but could have been better"></head><body><p>This movie is rather slowly paced, but largely makes up for it with excellent performances from most of the actors, a first rate musical score, and absolutely gorgeous locations and cinematography (the only movie I know of which visually represents the period as well or better is "Miller's Crossing").  The only thing I am really disappointed with is the ending.  I know the exact dramatic reasons that prompted the writer and director to make it the way they did, but the ending is all too predictable, and I really can't admire anyone who is too squeamish to try and defend himself from his own inevitable murder.</p></body></html>

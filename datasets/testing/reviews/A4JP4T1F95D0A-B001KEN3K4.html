I almost wish they had made this a bumbling spy movie without using the name Get Smart.  Carell does his own thing for the most part, and aside from saying "missed it by that much" a couple of times, he is a new character.  The names are all there, chief, 99, Kaos, Control, etc. and a few homages at the end, but it is not Get Smart.  There is some funny stuff, but not any real laugh out loud moments.  It is a decently made movie that moves along with enough humor and story to keep you interested, but not anything that makes me want to go see it again.  I would say it is average.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent musical, for those that like musicals"></head><body><p>High definition versions of Hairspray, the new (2007) version with Nikki Blonsky as Tracy Turnblad, John Travolta in drag as her mother, and Christopher Walken as her father are (sadly for this HD DVD fan) available in Blu-ray only currently.<br /><br />I had seen the older version years ago, but couldn't remember any of it.  My wife loved the new version of movie in the theatre. She saw it with friends of the African-American persuasion who were somewhat shocked by some early sequences in the movie, but they came around as the movie kept going.<br /><br />The film looked great on Blu-ray, nice, bright and colorful throughout. Some excellent effects in spots (the Harry Potter talking -- in this case singing -- picture effect as an example). If you like Musicals, this version is very entertaining. If you hate musicals, then skip it. Worth owning if you are a John Waters fan, but personally I rate it a 4/5 star rental as I just can't see myself rewatching this one enough times to justify space in my own video collection. People that love musicals should definitely make the space though :-)</p></body></html>

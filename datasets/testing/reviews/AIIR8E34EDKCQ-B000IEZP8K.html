<meta name="summary" content="I will be purchasing this one!"></head><body><p>It took me forever to finally rent this movie. I'm a huge fan of action and costume movies, and this one had both.<br />This is packed with quirky humor ( just like bits of it in the mummy) and great fighting seqences. The Rock is a good actor, i must say. There wasn't one moment where I was thinking "god, he can't act".<br />I've been a big fan of Kelly Hu since she was seen on Martial Law, a series with Samo Hung, canceled a few years ago.<br />I think she can fight better than the ROck, but in this movie, she used a few cool magic tricks ( the one with the cobra was an amazing scene) to save her butt.<br />Great movie, that I will have to buy, or I won't be able to sleep at night.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="In Praise of an Ordinary Life!"></head><body><p>What can I say except that this film is exceptional not only in its fine graphics, but in it's original story line.  At first, I must admit, it choked me up a bit.  Yes, I was moved by a cartoon!  I admit defeat and am not ashamed to.<br /><br />The way time progression was handled was brilliant.  To be able to view Carl and his deceased wife as children made us feel even more connected to these characters than we would have if they had left that whole time sequence out of the film.  She was spunky, he was quiet.  They made a sweet couple.  She had dreams that they never fulfilled, or so Carl thought.  What he found out in the end was an invaluable lesson...the joys of an ordinary life were treasured by his wife as an adventure in itself and made me realize that although most of our life is made up of the ordinary things like washing dishes, painting the porch and sorting socks...well, it's all an adventure nonetheless.  Take a chance on this film.  It was well worth the time spent watching it.</p></body></html>

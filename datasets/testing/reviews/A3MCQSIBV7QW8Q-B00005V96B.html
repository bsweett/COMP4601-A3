<meta name="summary" content="Pixar never seems to fail! "We scare because we care!""></head><body><p>As many reviewers have said, Pixar recent fourth hit has made a homerun! After making movies "A Bug's Life", "Toy Story", and "Toy Story II", Pixar and Disney hits it off big with "Monsters, Inc."<p>Children have always been afraid of monsters in their closet. They never realize what an important role they play in keeping the city of Monstropolis running. 'Monster Incorporations' is the corporation which 'takes and stores' 'scream energy'. Hiring a different assortment monsters to scare children to use their screams as energy to power up the whole of Monstropolis, 'Monsters Inc.' is a very powerful company. Until recently when the head of the company, Waternoose (James Coburn), finds out that the business is not doing well. Things get worse when top scare-er James P. "Sulley" Sullivan (John Goodman) gets involved in a situation where a young girl, named 'Boo' (Marry Gibbs), comes from the real world into the monster's world. She immediately attaches herself to Sulley who promptly asks for help from his best friend and assistant, Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). Can they keep the 'Child Detection Crew' from finding Boo? And can they make sure she gets home before monster rival to Sulley, Randall (Steve Buscemi) has his evil plans for Boo completed? Also starring is Celia (Jennifer Tilly) as Mike's girlfriend whom he's madly in love with, Roz (Bob Peterson) the cantankerous, stubborn, and strict worker at Monster's Inc., and Fungus with the voice of Frank Oz.<p>A most entertaining and hilarious movie, the perfect to movie to spend time watching with the family. The whole idea of "Monsters, Inc." is very original and interesting. From 'scream energy' to Monstropolis, from Child Detection Agency to closet doors being the doorway between the real world and the monster's world. The CG was excellent also, from the quality of Sulley's fur to Mike's eye, everything is well done making everything seem so real. One point I liked best was Randall, the whole idea of him being able to blend in to his surroundings and 'disappear' is pretty freaky for even older kids! Two thumbs up for fantastic work. Pixar also made very good choices for the voice talents of Sulley and Mike. John Goodman I have heard as Pacha in "The Emperor's New Groove". But never have I heard Billy Crystal's voice in any animation movie and you've got to admit, he's VERY GOOD at it! Just listening to him makes me laugh, always reminding me of his role as 'Miracle Max' in "The Princess Bride" (one of my all-time favorite movies).<br /><br />But one of the main things I loved about the movie is the well-done script. There are some very obvious jokes while some very subtle and witty humor is put in, making the movie very enjoyable for adults, too. One of the funniest things I liked about the movie is Celia's... hair. She's a monster of course and her hair is actually many snakes so the ends of her hair are snakes heads. And when she gets angry, you can see some tail ends 'rattling' making a rattlesnakes noise! I thought that was VERY hilarious and I was laughing so hard! Also another favorite part of mine is where Sulley is being attacked by Randall and Mike has NO clue to what's going on! <p>And of course, no one can miss any of the bloopers at the end of the movie. And still even after that, we get to see a very funny 'Broadway musical' (I forgot the name though I know that even just hearing it makes you laugh!). Then keep going to the very end of the film where you can read, "No monsters were harmed in the making of this movie." :-) Then there's the very beginning of the movie, before the story starts, you can watch Oscar-Award winning short film "For the Birds". It just simply cracked me up! The birds were so funny!<p>So if I STILL haven't convinced you to see this film, I don't know what else to say but, "you're missing out on one of the best family films ever." I know I'll be making sure to get the DVD when it comes out which is jam-packed with special features!</p></body></html>

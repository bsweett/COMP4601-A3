<meta name="summary" content="The Best Version So Far"></head><body><p>I remember waiting on a long line outside the Paris theater in Manhattan to see The Exorcist during its original run in 1973.  About 6 months later it made it to my local theater in Brooklyn and I waited on an enormous line to see it again.  If you weren't around at the time, this film created quite a stir during its original release. Its all that people were talking about and everyone (including myself) were out reading the novel as a result.<br />This blu-ray edition is the best edition I've seen yet.  This 2 disc set includes the version that was released in the movies and the version with the eleven minutes of additional scenes (including Regan's infamous "spider-walk.")  The picture and sound are obviously excellent.  The disc with the extened version includes a new 3 part retrospective with director William Friedkin, Producer/Writer William Peter Blatty, Cinematographer Owen Roizman and Linda Blair.  The disc with the original version includes a 1998 BBC documentary including interviews with Friedkin, Blatty and most of the surviving (as of 1998) cast members.  It is interesting to see how young Max Von Sydow actually was when he made The Exorcist.  The make-up turning him into an old man is almost as impressive as Linda Blair's demonic make-up.)  It is interesting to note that Blatty states his objections several times to labeling The Exorcist a horror film, he prefers a religious suspense thriller. I agree with him, I've never considered The Exorcist a horror film.  A shocker perhaps, but a horror film seems wrong.  (For the record, I still think "Psycho" is  the scariest film ever made.)  There are commentaries on both discs, trailers, etc. etc.<br />If you own a blu-ray player, this blu-ray release of this all-time classic is the  one to get.  I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

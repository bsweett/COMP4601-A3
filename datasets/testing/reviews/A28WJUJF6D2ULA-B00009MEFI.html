<meta name="summary" content="Odd Movie But Keeps You Watching"></head><body><p>At a mere eighty-one minutes run-time, Phone Booth seems more like a movie-of-the-week done for one of the testosterone-fueled cable networks than it does a theatrical release that stars several A-list performers. Colin Farrell (he sure does an American accent well, doesn't he?) stars here as a lying, using philanderer named Stuart, who is held hostage by an unseen sniper (voiced by Keifer Sutherland) in one of the final phone booths remaining in New York City. Forced by his sadistic captor to stay confined in the phone booth until he confesses his true nature and many falsehoods to those he has harmed, including an idealistic young woman played by Katie Homes, Stuart undergoes both a meltdown and a personal metamorphosis that transforms him even as it destroys the life he has created. Farrell, a sound actor despite his reputation as a fluffy playboy, delivers as a man confronted with both his impending demise and the flinty truth about who he has little by little become. Phone Booth is worth seeing if you're in the mood for a quick, fast movie, but it's not worth going to a lot of trouble to get.</p></body></html>

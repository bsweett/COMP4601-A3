I have heard all the praises of this movie but after watching it I think my opinion of this paramount achievement rose way above my expectations.<br /><br />Great reason for watching this movie other than the simple fact how fabulous it is the quite modern story with twists and turns as things happed in the Wild Wild West . I was entertained for the whole time with no slow moments and the never ending looming spiraling staircase of misfortune and quirky scenarios that kept happening to Blondie, as they called Eastwood and Tuco, his partner in crime. Without spoiling too much all I can say is that they both know a part of a secret, of a buried treasure; two hundred thousand dollars and each one of them knows on part of the location as they realize they need to join forces and overcome their differences in order to find it. Hot on their tail is the bad guy, known as Angel Eyes who has no soul and will kill anyone who gets in his way and who is also after the treasure.<br /><br />Eastwood is a great bad ass tough character, with that cold intelligent stare and his favorite cigar hanging in the corner of his mouth, and when he is squaring off with an opponent you just know who is quicker and who will win.<br /><br />Sergio Leone proves as a superb director with  flawless movie technique with short funny smart moments, fancy tricks, quick escapes and our main characters stepping on each others toes, turning against one another, trying to kill each other off until they reach their goal; the buried treasure. This movie might be almost 40 years old but its still 100% pure and solid entertainment, whether you like westerns or not, this is simply good fun. This saga of sun and gun stories involving clever characters are bound to be around for as long as movies are watched, and I promise that after watching this movie no one can feel anything other then a sense of great self worth and time well spent.</p></body></html>

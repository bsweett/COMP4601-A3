<meta name="summary" content="A film about impure justice and misguided revenge"></head><body><p>There are several outstanding features of Mystic River; the superb acting by the three male lead actors, the twisted unfolding plot, and the underlying theme of revenge and justice. I will discuss all three below.<br /><br />You can not beat Sean Penn's acting in this film. He portrays a rough man of the streets, trying to hold a family together and run a business, in a working class blue-collar neighborhood. He is fully alive in this role, as protective father seeking the murderer of his elder daughter while simultaneously dealing with his intense grief. His wife, Laura Lenney, describes him best in the final minutes of the film, when she emotionally absolves him of the murder of a childhood friend he mistakenly believes killed his daughter. She evokes the Jungian archtype of the king as she tells him he is a king who protects his family and home and that he acted on the best evidence he had, even if that evidence is flawed.<br /><br />Tim Robbins was amazing as the odd adult male who is still damaged by the childhood rapes he endures for 4 days at the hands of two male pediophiles. He now sees himself as a child continually trying to escape from the werewolves, which are the memories of the molestation he experienced. His oddity however marks him as a suspect for the murder of a 19 year old girl.<br /><br />Kevin Bacon plays the tight competent policman, trying to control his emotions under all circumstances when we see evidence that this strategy drove his wife from him.<br /><br />The story-line unfolds gradually, tragedy after tragedy, misunderstanding after misunderstanding, like a house of cards falling apart in slow motion. The interaction of the three main actors form the structure around which all the tragedy flows. Clint Eastwood paced this film very well, never rushing and never boring the audience.<br /><br />Underlying the plot however is the themes of justice, revenge, and our connectedness in a web of relationships. The film asks whether justice can ever be obtained and is it right to take justice into our own hands. In this case we see two men try to take justice into their own hands, Sean Penn and Tim Robbins, and the tragedy that unfolds because of that.<br /><br />However the film also displays our interconnectedness in that the dynamics of the tragedy are in the past and the tragedy continues into the future. As you watch, notice how much the murder of Just Ray by Sean Penn sets up the dynamic whereby Sean refuses to have his daughter date the son of Just Ray - a dynamic that begins the current tragedy of his daughter's death. So it is not just the molestation of Tim Robbin's character that sets the stage, it is also Sean Penn's murder of an old friend who betrays him that sets in play the death of his own daughter. On the day of her funeral, Sean Penn sits on his backporch, and addressing the trees and spirit of his daughter he says "I know that somehow I am responsible for your death, but I don't know how."  The film reveals to him and to us  how he was responsible.<br /><br />The film does not end on happy note, for Sean Penn kills again and this time it is a damaged man, also a secret killer. In the final scenes a softball parade goes through town, the characters lock eyes, knowing that an impure justice has occurred with which they all must live and the young son of the deceased Tim Robbins, sitting on a float in his softball uniform, implies that it will cycle through again, unresolved, because justice and revenge are structures of human interaction and relationship, not absolutes.</p></body></html>

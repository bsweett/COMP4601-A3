<meta name="summary" content="The Last Samurai - An exceptional epic film!"></head><body><p>As epic movies go, &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; is a superb one despite any historical inaccuracies which is what the History Channel is for.  All of the big named male actors such as Mel Gibson and Russell Crowe had their epic war movies and Tom Cruise was sorely due for one and in this movie he chose very well.  Over the years, like many super stars, Tom Cruise has chosen some extremely good roles and at the other end of the spectrum he's done some very poor movies but with &quot;The Last Samurai,&quot; the part couldn't have been better for him as it was supremely suited to his talents.<p>Along with the superior performance given by Tom Cruise, his co-actors in Timothy Spall, Ken Watanabe, Billy Connolly, Tony Goldwyn, Hiroyuki Sanada and Koyuki and so many others added greatly to the overall feel of the movie through their performances which were all of great depth and feeling.<p>Over the years, Edward Zwick has directed some of the finest movies to ever grace the silver screen such as &quot;Glory&quot; and &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; and &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; serves well to his legacy by being added to his library of exceptional films.  Additional credit goes to Hans Zimmer for the score for this outstanding film.<p>The Premise:<p>Civil War hero Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) has seen all too well the horrors of war and the policies of the American government in both dealing with soldiers of the south and especially Native Americans.  He is essentially forced into going to Japan to fight for the government against the Samurai that have for so long defended Japan but are now anachronistic in their eyes.  In a twist of fate, he is forced to lead his forces against the Samurai before they are ready and his forces are easily routed and he is captured.<p>Feeling merciful and wanting to learn more about his new enemy, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) spares his life and takes him to his village for the winter.  Captain Algren spends that time there and suddenly finds a rebirth...<p>What follows from there is an exceptional film both in its touching and intriguing story and the extraordinary battle scenes.  I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of films in this genre as they will be highly satisfied with it.  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>-Commentary by Director Edward Zwick<br />-History Channel Documentary &quot;History vs. Hollywood:  The Last Samurai&quot;<br />-Tom Cruise A Warrior's Journey<br />-Edward Zwick:  Director's Video Journal<br />-Making an Epic:  A Conversation with Edward Zwick and Tom Cruise<br />-A World of Detail:  Production Design with Lilly Kilvert<br />-Silk and Armor:  Costume Design with Ngila Dickson<br />-Imperial Army Basic Training<br />-From Soldier to Samurai:  The Weapons<br />-Deleted Scenes<br />-Japan Premieres<br />-DVD-ROM PC Web Link<br />-Theatrical Trailer</p></body></html>

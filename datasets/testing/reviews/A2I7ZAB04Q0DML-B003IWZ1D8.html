<meta name="summary" content="This Is the &quot;MOTHER&quot; Of All Horror Movies!"></head><body><p>By now, there are few people who don't alrady relate director Alfred Hitchcock with some of the most spine-tingling films of all time.  Having brought such features as &quot;Vertigo&quot; and &quot;The Birds&quot; to the big screen forever more concreted his name in the annals of film history as one of the true visionaries of the genre.  But perhaps his masterpiece, the most memorable film of his career, is the one that introduced audiences for the first time to the genre of the serial killer.  &quot;Psycho&quot;, starring Janet Leigh, would forever change the face of horror.<p>Marion Crane (Leigh) is a struggling secretary working for a real-estate salesman.  Having returned from a rendevous with her somewhat estranged boyfriend, Sam Loomis (John Gavin), she realizes that the two of them can only be together in a &quot;legitimate&quot; sense, if he can first settle a divorce between he and his wife.  What's more, his debts are large, and she knows that he will never fully be part of her life until his debts are paid.<p>As fate would have it, her boss had just closed a deal with a wealthy client, who insisted on paying for the house with cash.  Entrusted with the money, Marion leaves work early, having suddenly come down with a headache.  She heads home instead and begins to frantically pack her things so that she can drive out to meet her boyfriend who lives in Fairvale, California, which is several hundred miles from her own residence.  Without pause she sets out with the money in hand to meet him, convinced that she can solve their problems by using the money afforded her by the boisterous man she met earlier that day.<p>As she drives across country, she has a run-in with a police officer, and immediately, she begins to feel the paranoia that anyone guilty of a crime would feel.  As she continues her ventures west, her mind races with the scenarios that could unfold for her in the near future.  Weary of the road, and a bit down-trodden by her guilt, she pulls off the main hightway when a heavy rain unexpectedly begins to fall.  The road she travels brings her to the neon sign of a local motel &quot;The Bates Motel.&quot;<br />She pulls in and goes into the front office where she is met by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins).<p>Checking in under a false name, Bates invites her to dinner at his home, a large, run-down house on a hill behind the motel.  She accepts his invitation, asking first if she can freshen up.  Bates agrees and heads up to the house after showing her the room she will be staying in.  <p>While freshening up, she hears an argument from the house between Norman and a woman, whom Bates identifies as his &quot;mother&quot;.  Bates returns a short time later with a tray of food in hand, and apologizes, stating this mother is &quot;ill&quot; (mentally, not physically.)  They eat in his parlor instead, and during the course of their conversation, Marion realizes that she must return home, for she has made a mistake.  She retires to her room where she prepares to shower.<p>She never finishes the shower.  A woman, silhouetted in the darkness, attacks her unexpectedly, stabbing her repeatedly until she collapses into the basin of the tub, dead.  The silhouette figure flees the scene and before long, Norman returns, discovering the gruesome scene that has unfolded, knowing that the killer is none other than his mother.<p>And so the story truly begins.<p>What's interesting about &quot;Psycho&quot;, originally a novel written by Robert Bloch, is that the exposition of the story reminds us that &quot;we all go a little mad sometimes.&quot;  This simple premise is the underscoring of this story, for each of the characters, from Marion Crane through Norman Bates have a series of actions that are very cause and effect, suggesting that madness is relative to the situation and the events that impact each individual life.<p>Filmed entirely in black and white (despite the fact that films were commonly shot in color by this time), the movie uses light and shadow to incredible effect.  Where movies of today, especially in the horror genre, rely so heavily on special effects, this movie has virtually none, relying instead on situation, dialogue and character development to portray the slightly off-kilter world that only grows more distorted as the movie continues to its shocking, and (at the time it was filmed) very disturbing conclusion.<p>For anyone who has never seen this film, it is important to understand that, though timid by today's standards, this movie was so shocking at it's time that many viewers left the theater, unable to watch the movie, for its intensity was so great that it affected many audiences all over the country.  In viewing it, make sure that you watch the original Hitchcock edition.  There was a remake of the film in the 90's starring Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates and Anne Heche as Marion Crane.  Though a decent enough remake, it attempted, and in this reviewers humble opinion, failed to re-capture the essence of Hitchcock's genious. <p>The movie, whose cast also included Vera Miles as Lila Crane (Marion's sister), Martin Balsam (Detective Milton Arbogast), and Patricia Hitchcock (Alfred's daughter), is considered a film classic, and one of the AFI top 100 movies of all time.  It truly is a classic that has set the standard for the horror genre for all time to come.  Though many efforts have been made to recapture the essence of this film, there have been few entries in the annals of horror films that have even come close, save for maybe the original &quot;Halloween&quot; by John Carpenter. (INTERESTING SIDE NOTE: Jamie Lee Curtis, who made her debut as &quot;scream-queen&quot; in Carpenter's Halloween is Janet Leigh's daughter.) <p>-Scott Kolecki</p></body></html>

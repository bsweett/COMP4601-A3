<meta name="summary" content="Not as good as the first 2 & POOR DVD PACKAGE  SPOILERS"></head><body><p>I was right.<br />I knew from watching trailers & clips that the 3rd film is my least favorite of the 3 films.<br /><br />Not as funny.  No new good/funny characters.<br />Just did not have as much fun & good jokes as the first 2 films.<br /><br />Best thing about the film is the partial use of 3 songs-SPOILERS.  "Live & Let Die" my favorite Paul McCartney song.<br /><br />Now, the POOR DVD package.<br /><br />For a film that made as much money as it did what do we get when purchasing this DVD?<br />1.  PLAIN JANE GREY DVD-'DreamWorks" you should be ashamed with yourself for this old, cheap DVD.<br />2.  These horrible little flips to open the DVD package.  I hate these things.<br />3.  No list with chapter stops.<br /><br />Let us hope if they do make a 4th Shrek film the DVD is better designed.  "Dreamworks" show respect to the fans of the film, not give us this cheap no thought into it DVD package.</p></body></html>

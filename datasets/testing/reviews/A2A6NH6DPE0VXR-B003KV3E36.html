<meta name="summary" content="The Best Rambo Movie"></head><body><p>Rambo 4 is an incredibly violent yet entertaining action adventure. It's the best of them all actually. It's short but sweet but certainly not cuddly sweet. Rocky Balboa was a bit better but still this turnt out better than I expected since I'm not a big Rambo fan.<br /><br />  I just felt like everyone but Rambo's life was in danger in the movie. He was too much of an animal here, I mean he's like Michael Myers type strong. While it's so violent and even some-what disturbing that you'd think Rob Zombie was directing it. Performance wise though Stallone still does Rocky way better than he does Rambo. Rocky at least has a personality. Stallone handles the action great but when he's not violently destroying his enemies he's frowning like he has a stomach ache.</p></body></html>

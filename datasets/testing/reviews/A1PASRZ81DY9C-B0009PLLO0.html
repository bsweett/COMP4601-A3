<meta name="summary" content="One of the Worst Movies Made."></head><body><p>Viewed: 3/06<br />Rate: 1<br /><br />3/06: I've had the biggest misfortune to have seen Alexander because certainly that was one of worst pictures I have ever seen in my life. If I had to see it again, I couldn't be persuaded to think twice because that was one of the, if not the, worst ever. Alexander also has me questioning the greatness of Oliver Stone as a director, and I will have to be compelled to take his name off the Best Director list. How in the world did Oliver Stone go from awesomely made Platoon to totally wretched Alexander? Everybody was awful in Alexander, and the movie was so frigging long and utterly pointless in the sea of fogginess and confusion. A lot of cliches ravages Alexander as already the official prostitute, Angelina Jolie, reprises once again a slutty role; Colin Farrell, being a lame, pretentious Irish actor, plays in a non-Irish role; Anthony Hopkins plays an extremely pompous narrator and overly philosopher; Val Kilmer is acting like Jim Morrison once again; and Oliver Stone's overabundance of 70's atmosphere used in Doors, Natural Born Killers, and U-Turn. Natural Born Killers was bad. Any Given Sunday was worse. Alexander was the worst Oliver Stone picture of all time, seriously ranking one of the worst pictures of all time. It's a true hall-of-shame and a true hall-of-worst-pictures.</p></body></html>

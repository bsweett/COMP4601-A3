It has moments that shine, showing the cruel nature of high school cliques and alienation. We have clear cut stereotyped characters here who are driven by excellent dialogue. The group is so diverse when they first arrive at their Saturday detention, and in fact, their reasons for having to be in Saturday school are what bring them together. This group of youths who would never otherwise talk to one another is forced to be together for eight hours, and to bring them together a little quicker, we have a self-satisfied, diabolical school principal. We also have the social outcast "criminal" John Bender (played by Judd Nelson) who has marijuana to bring the group together. Each person has a different social standing and a different attitude toward life, but they discover that they have a lot in common, including insecurities and uncertainties about their identities and their lives. Even if their solidarity lasted for that one afternoon, they might have cause to think twice before stereotyping again. This is the best of this genre film, and strangely most of the people starring in the film have done relatively little since this film. Ally Sheedy has starred in flops, Molly Ringwald retreated to France (although she has made a few films and had a failed attempt at a tv sitcom), Emilio Estevez does films sometimes which have a modest amount of success, Anthony Michael Hall shows up occasionally (as in Pirates of the Silicon Valley, in which he plays Bill Gates), and Judd Nelson has made a few films and starred on the sitcom Suddenly Susan for a few years before leaving to try to revive his film career.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The only thing surprising about this film is how boring it is"></head><body><p>To begin with, I'm not a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan, so I'm not writing a bad review because I'm disappointed in this film compared to his previous endeavors, although his other films are clearly more critically appreciated and arguably better written and executed.<br /><br />The acting on all fronts is superb - Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard stand out in their respective roles as a depressed apartment manager and some kind of mermaid fairy tale figure.<br /><br />The cinematography of the entire film has a kind of greenish-blue hue around it which makes the film beautiful visually, but stunningly disappointing story-wise. A mermaid appears one day in the pool of the apartment complex, and the apartment manager sets out to try to get her home.<br /><br />What follows is an inanely repetitive story line in which Paul Giamatti repeatedly asks an old woman about an ancient myth. Each time he learns something new it then happens in real life. In trying to move away from his secret twist endings, it seems Shyamalan moved so far away that he  decided to spell out every step of the film without a surprise to be found.<br /><br />This leaves the viewer as bored as Shyamalan must have been writing the script. After over two hours of watching what you've just been told is about to happen, viewers will find themselves ready for the film to end in its predictable way so they can get on with their lives.<br /><br />Unless you're really interested in M. Night Shyamalan, Bryce Dallas Howard, or boredom, stay away from this film.</p></body></html>

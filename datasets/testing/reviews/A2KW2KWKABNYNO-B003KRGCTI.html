<meta name="summary" content="The Book of Eli That Happens To Be A Religious Book of High Significance"></head><body><p>Walking into The Book of Eli, I didn't really know what to expect aside from the fact that it's set in a depressing post-apocalyptic wasteland, and it features Denzel wielding a big knife and doing cool things with it. If that's all the movie had been, I probably would have been more or less entertained by it. But no, the movie goes above and beyond the call of duty, and for a movie about a book, it's a pretty solid film.<br /><br />What stuck me most about this film is probably the unique direction and world-building the film does. It's never really told what caused this apocalypse, but this post-apocalyptic world is kind of a beautiful world. The color has a very distinct tone to it, and even though the film mostly takes place in the California desert, the landscape seems very alive and striking. Watching Denzel just walk in front of a broken interstate towering above him is just a cool visual. And since the world is set 30 years after the apocalypse, everything looks it. Roads have a cracked, but dry quality. Cars are rusted, the paint on houses are peeling, and door hinges easily give way. Also, the world, at least as it shows, show society as reverted back to Western times. It's not really overt, but there's certainly the distinct feel of it in the scenes of the town. In fact, my biggest problem with the movie is that they didn't go deeper into the world. I want to know what it was like before. What was Denzel like before all this happened. Was he in the condition that he was in before it happened? You can see a K-Mart name tag with Eli's name on it at one point, but other than that, the movie is very specific in its scope. I just loved what they did with it so much, I wanted to see more of it.<br /><br />Also, I've never see The Hughes Brothers at work before, but they have a great visual style. And it's not just the color either. It's the shadows, how they light the fight sequences, the camera angles, what you can hear, when you can hear it, and how it's emphasized. I usually don't notice these technical details when I'm watching a film, but Eli certainly makes it stand out, for the better I think. Certainly, all the crew have promise, and I hope to see great things from them in the future. This includes a special shoutout to screenwriter Gary Whitta, who has never done a movie before this, but comes out with a splendid script for his first effort.<br /><br />But that isn't to say the movie is perfect. I could predict about 75% of the plot fairly easily, and I didn't have much love/use for Mila Kunis until she started blowing crap up. Still, by the end of the movie, they had convinced me that Meg Griffin could in fact be a believable bad-ass. There I said it. I thought it was impossible, but Eli showed me otherwise. Speaking of which...<br /><br />Denzel really is one of the, if not the highlight of the movie as the mysterious, but still thoroughly bad-ass Eli, who has a penchant for cutting off heads with a very sharp blade in the shadows. But it's not just the blade, as Eli is also impressive with a gun. Denzel pulls all the aspects of the character off with ease and coolness, while still being wise as all get out. Also, Gary Oldman is back in full form, channeling the slimy villainy he ruled over in the 90s. The character is a bit too serious, but Oldman makes the best out of the character.<br /><br />And then there's the end. A lot of people won't like it, but I like how it isn't the typical ending you'd expect from a movie like this. Is it believable? It's certainly a leap, but it works for Denzel's character, and makes him an even greater character. Plus, everything is wrapped up pretty nice, so I'll give it that too.<br /><br />Overall, atheists beware, this is a well-done movie that shows promise for everybody involved creatively. It also shows that Denzel is not without hope, Gary Oldman can still be slimy, and Mila Kunis can actually be cool. It's a surprisingly good movie and a satisfying one at that.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="They finally fixed the lightsaber!"></head><body><p>Too much of a Star Wars geek, methinks... In the original Star Wars, right after Obiwan's death, Darth Vader can be seen wandering around with his lightsaber...except it wasn't coloured red, because they'd forgotten to colour it in. In the Special Edition, back in 1997, I had expected this fixed, but they somehow had time to add in all sorts of special things, but not to fix this bug. Well, finally, on the new Star Wars DVD, its finally fixed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bring on the Sequel!"></head><body><p>A very pleasant surprise, I Robot, brings to the screen exactly what the title implies: Robots-and lots of them!<br /><br />But that is not the only thing that there is plenty of; it combines action, adventure and comedy, making this movie definitely worth watching.<br /><br />Will Smith, Bridget Moynahan, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances well, though Will Smith does overdo it with his character's "attitude problem"/ "Chip on his shoulder"etc; it gets tiring after a while, not to mention unrealistic (e.g. being sarcastic and giving the billionaire owner of the robot company a "hard time").<br /><br />Nevertheless, the setting, the plot, and the special effects are all wonderful, not to mention the ending, which is great.<br /><br />Therefore, I would definitely line up to watch a sequel!</p></body></html>

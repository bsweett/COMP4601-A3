<meta name="summary" content="When saving one life destroys another"></head><body><p>Evan  (Ashton Kutcher) is a young man who's blocked out specific events from his memory...events that not only traumatized  Evan , but also traumatized two of his friends as well as the brother of one of those friends.  Determined to get those memories back,  Evan  figures out a way to travel back in time to revisit those memories.  However, what he uncovers is so disturbing that he now wants to change those events so the future can  turn out better for  both him and his friends.<br /><br />But  no matter how hard he tries, changing the past doesn't create the happy ending  Evan  is hoping for, which frustrates him.  When he tries to save one person, another person ends up getting mentally and/or physically crippled ... and some even get killed.  Soon,  Evan  becomes obsessed with trying to get the past right and starts losing his mind in the process.<br />It's only when he stops trying to control everything that he eventually sets everyone free....but it's also tragic in what he has to do to make that happen.<br /><br />I'm used to seeing  Ashton Kutcher  play dopey roles in "That 70's Show" and "Dude, Where's my Car?", so I didn't know if  Kutcher  could pull off a serious role.  He did surprisingly well.  The supporting characters are also convincing in their roles, too.  Evan's childhood male friend  is especially chilling in the bedroom scene where we see how  Evan's  actions changed his future.<br /><br />Just a word of warning, when it's revealed what really happened in  Evan's  childhood, it's pretty disturbing what's revealed.  You don't actually see what happens in graphic detail (thank goodness), but it is implied so your imagination fills in the blanks.<br />Overall, I thought this was a compelling story.  The beginning starts out mysteriously as you see a little boy go into these fugue states and you don't know why, but are curious to know why.  It's also compelling to see if  Evan  can ever right what went wrong in his past.</p></body></html>

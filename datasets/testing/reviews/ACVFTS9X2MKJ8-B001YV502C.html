The documentary puts this world at this level of despair thanks to man's neglect to recognize "global warming".  The film was almost miserable to watch but I'm glad that I saw it.  I see it as a plausible warning about our future destination rather than just to be entertained.  The camera work was really good.  Almost like how Stanley Kubrick put a greater emphasis to a scene.  People walking towards or away from the camera as the cameraman follows the person so you would see that person's horrific surroundings as he passes through it.  Visual destruction was everywhere.  So this film was definitely visually stunning.<br /><br />I never thought that I would ever see and hear the classic song "In the Court of the Crimson King" put to a movie.  What shocked me was when that song came on,  I thought that my CD player just kicked on for no reason because I did, in fact, have King Crimson's CD in my CD player at that time.<br /><br />And did anyone else notice one scene at the window where you saw a balloon of a "pig", and the old pollution spewing chimneys of that classic old factory that was used on the "Animals" album from Pink Floyd?  Perhaps this is one clue put in about "global warming".  I wonder if there are other unique references to our past that is used here in a future about 20 years from now.  The music in this film was all just a bunch of music from their past.  I wonder if that was meant to say that all the musicians of the world are already succumbed to extinction so the only music that's known and heard is all so old.  That's something to ponder.<br /><br />I think I need to watch this again.  Now I'm curious to know if I've missed anything else in the backgrounds of each scene.</p></body></html>

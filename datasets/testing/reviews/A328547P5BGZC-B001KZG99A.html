It is after all the credits. (you wont be disappointed)**<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr was great as Tony Stark / Iron Man. The movie had a wonderful cast including:<br /><br />Terence Howard ...  Jim Rhodes<br />Jeff Bridges ...  Obadiah Stane<br />Gwyneth Paltrow ...  Pepper Potts<br />Leslie Bibb ...  Christine Everhart<br /><br />Jon Favreau directed this movie and plays a small role and Iron Man creator Stan Lee even has a cameo in the movie.<br /><br />Personally I thought Gwyneth Paltrow was great in her role. The movie itself has a great story, great back story and outstanding ending.<br /><br />The Spiderman trilogy was good, Iron Man is on a whole other level!<br /><br />See this one!</p></body></html>

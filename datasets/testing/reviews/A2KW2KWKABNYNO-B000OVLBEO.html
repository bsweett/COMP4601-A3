<meta name="summary" content="Nicolas Cage Saves This Movie From Oblivion"></head><body><p>Nick Cage is one of my personal favorite movie actors, mostly because he's so darn likeable, and he's been in some darn good movies, and some not so good. He also doesn't like to not work, so he takes most everything on his plate, and does a heck of a lot more than most other actors. This movie however is a departure for him, because it definitely doesn't seem like the movie, or character he'd play. But in the end, he somehow pulls it through, despite a very weak beginning, and a so-so middle. Darn it, I just gave you a review of most of the movie.<br /><br />Story: Around two or three in the morning on TNT a few months ago(isn't that when all the best movies are on?), I watched most of Blade 3. A generally terrible movie had it not had Ryan Reynolds to pick it up with his quirky and humorous personality. Ghost Rider amazingly has numerous similarities to Blade, from the whole supernatural storyline, hero, and yes, devilish villain (pun intended). But overall, there's nothing really interesting or compelling, or for that matter, original about the story. This is probably because the story, except for background info on the characters, is just background.<br /><br />By the way, superhero movies' back-stories have always been the weakest part of the movies. Not many can seem to pull off how they became a superhero, or their childhood story without boring me to death (think Spider-Man 1). This movie is no exception. Yes, it was very important, but could they have speed it up?<br /><br />Acting and Characters: Nicolas Cage of course saves the movie, with his personality, subtle humor, and just plain likability to an unlikable character. Johnny Depp in no way could have pulled off this role without turning it, well, into a dark Blade type movie, as opposed to a light Blade type movie (besides Depp will always being playing some version of Jack Sparrow in my mind.). Eva Mendes, is of course, as the damsel usually is, one of the weakest characters in the movie. She's a bit bland, unrealistic, and at times just does stuff that doesn't make any sense. Ghost Rider's friend (that guy from all those cancelled TV shows?) pulls off his poorly written role off quite nicely, making the character likeable. However, I don't know whether the guy is dead or not, can somebody tell me? Sam Elliot does great in his mysterious role, in which he doesn't do much, except provide a "twist" in the movie.<br /><br />Peter Fonda does a good job playing the devil, which may or may not be a good thing. Wes Bentley is very convincing, but his minions are all clearly failed Sci-fi channel actors. Which is about the worst comment you can get as an actor.<br /><br />The Effects: Nothing really jaw-dropping, or wow moments, or anything like that. No totally amazing action sequences. Instead, the action sequences look very cartoonish, and it seeps into the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, an okay movie. Nothing really amazing, nothing really horrible either. However, Nicolas saves the movie in the corny role of Johnny Blaze, in a pretty corny movie. No Oscars are coming out for this movie. But a few Razzies might pay mind. Of course, coming from the guy that made Dare Devil, I would kind of expect it. This movie wants you to think it's Spider-man quality, but really, it belongs back in the 90's. But I wouldn't be opposed to a sequel.<br /><br />Real Score: 3.5</p></body></html>

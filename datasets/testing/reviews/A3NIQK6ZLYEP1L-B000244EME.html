<meta name="summary" content="Best collection for Predator."></head><body><p>2 discs, the first with the movie (one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever with a great sound track), the second with tons of extras, including outtakes, featurettes on character design, stunts, special effects, interviews, makeup, location, camouflage tests of the predator and a photo gallery.  Only flaw is the director commentary for the first disc - seems to be nothing but stuff he said during interviews spliced together.  Kind of boring but not boring enough to take away a star.<br /><br />Buy it new or used.</p></body></html>

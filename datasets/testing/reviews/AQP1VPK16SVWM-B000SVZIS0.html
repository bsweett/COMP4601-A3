The production design, cinematography, make up and most of the effects work are among the best of the year. The screenplay, on the other hand, is another story (pardon the pun). Clearly reworked a number of times by a number of writers (the old equation was for every writer credited add two more so, if we use this, there were at least six writers involved. Even if this isn't true it shows) Film making by committee only works when there is a vision. Burton clearly doesn't have it for this workmanlike remake.<br /><br />I'm not going to bore you with story details as others have covered that already. I will, however, cover the quality of the film, discs and extras. The film has it's moments. There are a number of stunning set pieces but little follow through. The opening sequence could have been even more stunning if there was a sense of suspense and if Mark Wahlberg could act. He can't. I have to ask this--why is he seemingly out of breath throughout most of the film? There clearly was a lot of thought put into the acting (or in the case of Tim Roth overacting--maybe he was trying to make up for the short comings of other cast members). The acting varies depending on performer. There are a number of striking performances buried in a pile of over and underwhelming performances.<br /><br />The meat of the disc is in the ability to watch picture in picture with an explaination how how a scene was created. The audio commentary by Burton is less than informative at times (when it comes to the left of center ending...he can't justify it beyond saying, it works for me). Like many remakes (Wild Wild West comes to mind), POA is a misfire. Rule of thumb for most films is that if Kris Kristoferson can be found in any frame of the film, it's probably bad (there are rare exceptions to this rule).<br /><br />The second disc goes bananas with documentaries about the making of the film. These are actually quite interesting. You're able to a variety of make up tests all at the same time and choose which one you want to listen to. Interesting concept that should be applied to a number of contemporary film classics. This makes purchasing the disc or renting it almost worthwhile.<br /><br />If there is a sequel to POA, Burton only has to go up from here. Like the first Star Trek film, POA has a lot of potential. It just doesn't measure up to what inspired it. The original film despite the fact that many of the effects haven't aged well (although the stunning crash landing sequence could teach Burton a thing or two about film making and suspense. A pity Franklin Schaffer isn't around to offer some advice), the script by Rod Serling and Michael Wilson (Emmy and Academy Award winners)was always intelligent. Both Serling and Wilson knew when to play it straight and camp it up. I'd give POA 1 1/2 stars for the film and another star for the extras.<br /><br />A pity that millions of dollars was wasted on this film. Another criticism--this one directed at 20th Century Fox; the great extras and fine packaging is how the original film classic should have been treated. The shoddy extras on that film and the lack of inclusion of the documentary (or even parts of it) is inexcusable. Although Franklin Schaffer isn't with us any longer (nor Serling, McDowell or Wilson), Kim Hunter and Charleton Heston are very much alive and active. Both could have been called on to provide an audio commentary. Fox needs to take a hint from the reissues that Anchor & Bay have been doing. For a great example of how a film classic should be treated check out The Wicker Man (the 2 disc set) or The Devil Rides Out.</p></body></html>

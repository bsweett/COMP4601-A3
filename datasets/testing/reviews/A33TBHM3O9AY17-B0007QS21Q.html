<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining and imaginative, but the same old Will Smith."></head><body><p>I watched this one with my family over the weekend and, quite frankly, had a ball.  Yeah, to some extent it's a movie with a message, but mainly it's just plain entertaining.  If you try to read too much into it, you'll miss the opportunity for a good old-fashioned sci fi romp.<br /><br />Fast forward to the year 2035.  The monolithic company "U.S. Robotics" has put NS-4 domestic assistant robots into mass production, so much so that they are commonplace "members" of American society.  Their artificial intelligence is designed to be as much like humans as possible, but is regulated by the "3 laws" programming that is hardwired into every robot.  These laws are:  1. To protect human life above all; 2. To obey human commands except if it would violate law 1; and 3. To protect its own existence unless doing so would violate laws 1 or 2.  The laws seem a foolproof way to ensure that the robots would never pose a threat to humanity.  But all that changed when the man billed as the father of robotic technology and the 3 laws turns up dead in a very public, and very suspicous, manner, just as the new and improved NS-5 model is about to flood the market.  The death is quickly written off by all concerned as a suicide.  All except detective Dale Spooner, this is.<br /><br />Being a good cop and a sharp detective, Spooner (played by Will Smith) in not content that the professor's death was a suicide, and begins investigating with the lead suspect, an NS-5 robot named "Sonny".  Sonny's intelligence is so advanced, and his "emotions" so well simulated, that he appears to have something resembling a human soul.  Spooner believes that Sonny killed the professor, and sets out to prove it.  His (over)zealous approach to the task, coupled with his deep distrust of robots and their manufacturer, quickly lands him in hot water with some powerful people.  Some difficult and destructive encounters with the metallic menaces leave him looking like an obsessive paranoiac, and ultimately result in his suspension from the police force.<br /><br />Spooner continues his chase nonetheless, following a series of clues left by the dead professor, as step by step the mystery begins the unwind.  All along the way are some great action sequences, plot twists and one-liners.  However, except for Will Smith's character (which is the same as it has been in every film he has done since "Men in Black"), nothing about the story is predictable.  When the final shoe drops, most viewers will be pleasantly surprised by the unexpected ending.<br /><br />All in all, I really enjoyed this movie.  It was a wild ride with lots of great sci fi treats and effects.  The only downsides were the lack of character development on any signficant level -- this is a purely plot-driven movie -- and the fact that Will Smith essentially played himself, much as he always does.  Still, it's worth seeing.  I certainly don't regret the investment of two hours.</p></body></html>

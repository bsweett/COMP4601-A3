<meta name="summary" content="Not bad"></head><body><p>This movie is not bad. I'm not a star fan at all, but for some reason I can't sit and enjoy this movie knowing that if this movie wasn't around Brad might still be married to Jen. I think Angelina is a good actress, but when I watch this movie I feel very disappointed in her. I really can't sit threw this movie with out those thoughts going threw my head. So I don't enjoy this movie.</p></body></html>

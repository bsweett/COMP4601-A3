<meta name="summary" content="Prince of Judea Gets Royal Treatment From Warner Bros"></head><body><p>This review refers to the Warner Bros SINGLE DISC DVD edition of "BEN-HUR"......<br /><br />Well, I am just absolutely thrilled at the treatment this 1959 classic epic has recieved in the transfer to DVD. Warner Bros has really done a superb job. The picture, color, clarity and sound could not be any better if this film was made yesterday. It is presented in the original anamorphic widescreen, and what a view. You won't miss a bit of the academy award winning cinematography. The chariot race, the sea battle,the splendors of Rome and all the glorious and immense sets will just have you in awe. The wonderful technicolor on this DVD is a stand out compared to some others of this era(there were a couple of occasions where there was some sort of greenish tint, but in the background and did not interfer with the view). The sound is enhanced in Dolby Dig  Surround 5.1 and is just excellent. The music, dialouge and all surrounding sounds are crystal clear.<br /><br />The film runs about 3 1/2 hours(you need to flip the disc at about the 2:20 mark, a good time to raid the fridge!), and includes the original overture and intermission music. And if you can't get enough, the DVD also includes some fabulous features. There is audio commentary by Charlton Heston, screen tests, a photo gallery,career highlights, subtitles in English, French(it may also be viewed in French) Spanish and Portuguese.<br />There is also an hour long behind-the-scenes documentary "BEN-HUR: The Making of an Epic". This feature not only goes  into depth in the making of this version, but also gives some great information on the 1925 version with Ramon Novarro, and even has some footage of the very first celluloid attempt of the story(which ran 15 min) from 1907, and background information on the book and it's author. There are some great interviews with cast and crew(from both of these huge films).<br /><br />"BEN-HUR", the story of a Jewish Prince who's life paralells that of Christ,is an epic saga that takes him from a nobleman, to a galley slave to a hero. The film won a record breaking 11 Acamedy Awards in 1959, including Best Picture, Best Director(William Wyler), Best Cinematography, Best Actor(Charlton Heston) and Best Supporting Actor(Hugh Griffith). This record was unmatched for nealy 40 years, when in 1997  "Titantic" burst onto the scene.<br /><br />It is a wonderful story, and has something for everyone. The cast includes some of the greats from the 50's. Look for Jack Hawkins as Quinas Arrius the Roman whose life is saved by Judah Ben-Hur, Stephen Boyd as Messala, Judah's boyhood friend who turns on him,Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell as his beloved mother and sister, and Haya Harareet as Esther, the woman he loves.<br /><br />If you have never seen this film before, keep reading some of the other terrific and informative reviews here that delve more into the story, and trust me this is one great story! For those that have seen it, you will fall in love all over with this film on this excellent DVD. There is another edition for sale as well, the "Limited Edition Collector Set". It looks like it comes with lots of goodies for the serious collector, but is quite a bit more expensive. The studio of release on that one is not Warner Bros though.<br /><br />Bravo Warner Bros and Thank You!<br /><br />also available in great 3 pack:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000087EYC">Best Picture Collection - Epic Dramas (Casablanca/Gone With the Wind/Ben-Hur)</a>(check for best deals available)<br /><br />enjoy....Laurie</p></body></html>

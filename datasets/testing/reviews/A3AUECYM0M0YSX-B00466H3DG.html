<meta name="summary" content="To Know or Not To Know, That Is The Question..."></head><body><p>This movie turned out to be a half-full, half-empty glass of water. I saw it half-full. My wife saw it half-empty. For once, she was the pessimist. (Write this date down!)<br /><br />To me it raised the interesting question of, if you know ahead of time how disappointing something is going to turn out, is it still worth going through anyway? Few things meet our expectations; the concept always outshines the actuality. But when you fall in love everything seems like it's going to be peachy for the rest of eternity. Disappointment almost always looms. It's how you deal with it that counts.<br /><br />Because even in the best relationship, you're going to get bored with each other. You're going to start to find small niggling faults becoming reasons for a major fallout. Most breakups aren't over big, dramatic actions ("You slept with my sister while you said you were on a business trip in Seattle!") but rather small things that start to irritate you about the other person--the weird color they dye their hair, or how they say "liberry" instead of "library."<br /><br />This is what happens to both Jim Carey and Kate Winslet in this movie. And both of them, to forget each other, have their memories of the other person flushed out. But to paraphrase Tennyson, is it better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all? That's the difficult question the movie grapples with, and the astonishing thing about it is that you never feel like it's "grappling" with it at all. Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman knows how to deal with some uncommon themes (particularly in Hollywood, where any film in which the female lead doesn't take her top off or get hung upside-down on a meat hook is considered practically an art film these days) very naturally. Carey gradually discovers that even bad feelings have their upside, their purpose, because without them the good have no context. They're inseparable, and when the "bad" ones have to go so must the good. Too late he realizes this is not what he wants. Then a series of complications almost too twisted to chart ensue. Kaufman must have had a roadmap tacked to his wall to keep it all straight. The astonishing thing--and the tribute to his screenwriting prowess--is that we the viewers can keep them straight too. Despite a story that's almost impossible to re-tell, Eternal Sunshine is actually a very easy movie to watch, never confusing, never too fast or too slow. This is no small achievement.<br /><br />So that's my take on things. My wife's view is that the film was trying to say that no matter how many chances you get, you still make the same stupid mistakes. She cites as evidence the moment in the doctor's office where the receptionist tells a patient she can't have the procedure three times in one month. She cites as evidence the fact that although a key character (not Winslet) has her memory wiped clean, she turns around and does the same foolish thing with another person when the same opportunity presents itself. All true, but I think that's more of a subplot than *the* plot. The minor characters may fumble about, but our heroes Kate and Jim will learn something in the end from their stumbles, and they do, at an empty beach house, that has to be one of the saddest, most underwritten (in a good way), farewell scene I've watched in years (decades?). Kaufman and the producers trusted their audience. They didn't feel they needed to get out the pile driver. It's beautiful writing. I wish there were more intelligence like this in Hollywood these days.<br /><br />As some others have noted, this is first and foremost a director and writer's picture. It's not the acting that carries things along. Still, the right casting is important, for we really have to relate to these characters quickly, since we don't get a lot of exposition before things go nonlinear. In Jim Carney we have the perfect "everyman." I never care for Carey when he's manic or crazy, but beneath the "over-the-top" persona there beats the warm heart of a genuine artist. Brit Kate Winslet astonishes at how effortlessly she plays a very American, very ordinary character--every semi-big town is full of "individualists" like Clementine, with her ever-changing hair, Doc Marten boots, and terminal retail career outlook. ("I'm just a f---ed up girl looking for her own piece of mind!") Both characters have the tough and thankless job of appearing unremarkable while making us care about them very much. Kirsten Dunst plays the Cameron Diaz role--a nice but ditzy blonde who spends a lot of time dancing around in her underwear. Elijah Wood and Mark Ruffalo look like they should have the Verizon wireless Network behind them. (How the sophisticated job of memory erasure is done with a couple of laptops and some simple software is hilarious.) And Tom Wilkinson is effortless, as usual, in the supporting role of the doctor who runs the clinic that vacuums minds the way those cheap professional maid services vacuum carpets. (You never quite trust them in your house. Are they going to break your porcelain knick-knacks? Raid your fridge and drink your beer?)<br /><br />But mostly it's the ideas--and the way they're executed--that makes Eternal Sunshine so memorable. Extras include lots of interviews with Carey and director Michel Gondry, Winslet and Gondry (where things start out a little testy, and no, I don't think they were kidding), a making-of featurette that includes the scoop on how they did the remarkable special effects (not how you'd think in this digital day and age), and lots of other goodies we've come to expect from hit movies. Transfer to DVD is excellent. This is one of the more intelligent films to come out in recent years. Here's looking forward to the next Charlie Kaufman project.</p></body></html>

He needs to make a movie without his cocoon of film friends"></head><body><p>Instead of Mickey yelling out, "Hey, gang, let's put on a show in the old barn!" we have Wes Anderson calling together all his film-making friends and saying, "Hey gang, let's make a movie in India!" And being Wes Anderson, we can expect the movie to be amusing, warm, clever, heavy on the protagonists struggling to learn life's lessons...and lightweight. The Darjeeling Limited, a story of three brothers traveling in India who are trying, sometimes reluctantly, to resolve family issues, has a number of fine qualities. Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman work very well together as the edgy brothers. All the actors are fun to watch. Bill Murray has an amusing and wordless bit as a man racing to catch a train. The settings throughout India are intriguing. There are one or two delayed jokes that can create a smile. But in my opinion there's just not much weight behind the hip, gentle humor. Anderson's fascination with relationships is nothing new. And with Anderson's need at the conclusion to underline the movie's message -- we need to discard all that old baggage we keep hauling around -- by making the message literal, we wind up not with a gentle moral message but with ponderous movie making.<br /><br />I have a feeling that if Anderson is unable or unwilling stop making movies without the comfortable cocoon of like-minded film friends around him, he's going to fade into repetitive irrelevance. Even cleverness is no substitute for a well-constructed story. For instance, The Darjeeling Limited comes with a 13-minute seemingly separate film short which takes place enigmatically in a suite in a Paris hotel. The two unnamed characters are played by Schwartzman and Natalie Portman. There are silent expectations and silent moments, some sad and smart dialogue, and we get the idea that the woman left the man, may be coming back into his life...but maybe not for long. A bed plays a prominent part, with Schwartzman staying clothed and Portman nude. What's the point? None, except as a little slice of accomplished film-making. We wind up, during those 13 minutes, getting involved with these two people and their attempt, especially by the Schwartzman character, to hope for the best. Ah, but then in The Darjeeling Limited, we find that the short was just a set-up, and an unnecessary one, for another amusing delayed bit of character humor. Was it needed? No. Was it clever? Yes. Is it an example of the kind of flabby storytelling and insider cuteness that can happened among film friends who are making a movie? I think so.<br /><br />What I really enjoyed about The Darjeeling Limited was life aboard the Indian train as it chugged through the countryside for half of the movie...what the old, elegant sleeper compartments and the fringed dining car looked like...how the tea and snacks were delivered...what the system of ticket taking was on board...how the train attendants worked...what the train stations looked like. But then I like trains. But I'm not so sure I'll be eager again to get on board another Wes Anderson movie unless he sets off in a new direction.</p></body></html>

Almost as impressive was the story, a fantasy-mystery- romance-drama combination set in Vienna, Austria, around the turn of the 20th century.<br /><br />It is a story that should keep most viewers intrigued all the way and perhaps surprised quite a bit at the end. Edward Norton does his normal job of making you fascinated with whatever character he's playing, this time a magician with almost supernatural powers: "Herr Eisenheim." The character he plays, and the tone of the movie in general, is pretty low-key with next to nothing in violence or profanity.<br /><br />It's simply a classy film and a modern-day one that older folks would very much enjoy as well as younger adults.  I haven't talked to anybody yet who watched this and didn't like it.</p></body></html>

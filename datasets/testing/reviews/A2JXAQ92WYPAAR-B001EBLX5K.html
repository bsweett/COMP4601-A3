Before WWII, American humor consisted of silliness. After the war, humor began to take itself seriously, particularly in the 60s with all these so-called brilliant comedians with college educations and axes to grind. Pure nonsense got lost along the way. Many of us have not forgotten, however, as evidenced by the continuing popularity of the Marx Brothers. Borat fits right in with that lovable family of goofs. Can't you just picture him there at the races with Harpo, Groucho, or Zeppo? The intelligence, of which he has plenty, is shown in his razor sharp satire. Oh, this goofiness should not be interpreted as stupidity. He's brilliant. He's a genius. He's sees a lot, and in this short film succeeds in showing as much about America that is true and deeply revealing as any of the serious dramas that incite rave reviews. Borat falls in with Harpo Marx and Forrest Gump as a lovable moron whose innocence is crucial for exposing the lies and hypocrisy of Americans, especially those who claim to be "good," "honest," or "proper." Borat is all about pulling the curtain aside to show everybody that the Wizard is a humbug.</p></body></html>

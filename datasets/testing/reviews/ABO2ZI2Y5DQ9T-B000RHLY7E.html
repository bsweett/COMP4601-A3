<meta name="summary" content="More Violence and Torture Than "1000 Corpses": Rob Zombie Film in 70s Style and Not Bad at That"></head><body><p>Though main characters from "House of 1000 Corpses" re-appear, it may not be exactly right to call "The Devil's Rejects' a sequel. True, "The Devil's Rejects" is extremely gory and violent, but the film's entire tone gets less jokey and more nihilistic, closer to that of new American films made in late 60s and early 70s before such as "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Straw Dogs."<br /><br />Am I taking the film too seriously? Maybe or maybe not. Whatever the truths may be, it is true that writer / director Rob Zombie improved his skills. Beware, however, that his improved skills include several torture scenes and killings that will be disgusting to some. Body counts rise steadily up until its ending and so is the cruelty of the characters.<br /><br />The story has not much to tell. Even fans of the film would admit that it is predictable and formulaic. The house of Captain Spaulding and his family is raided by policemen led by Sheriff John Quincy Wydell (William Forsythe). Two escape, but one is captured. The escapees start another killing spree before the final confrontation with the sheriff who prefers to exact vigilante type 'justice' by outdoing what the family had been doing.<br /><br />The acting of the killing family is all in all good - good, I mean, in playing the nastiest and most sadistic characters in a frightening way - but it must be admitted that they are all outshined by underrated William Forsythe doing over-the-top acting which is fun to see. Fun is, I must add, of unique kind.<br /><br />Viewers would find the film too bloody and sick, but some of them would love it for that reason. I was fascinated with Rob Zombie's skills to make relentlessly violent scenes about the relentlessly depraved people, and his homage to the 70s films, using the minimum-scale sets, road movie formula, hand-held camera, soundtrack music and so on. Lots of cameos include Michael Berryman. What else do you expect?<br /><br />If you ask me whether I would see "The Devil Rejects" again or recommend to others, my answer would be probably No. But the watch was fascinating, and I couldn't stop watching it. But I am not sure you will find it the same way.</p></body></html>

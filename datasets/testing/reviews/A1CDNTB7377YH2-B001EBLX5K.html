<meta name="summary" content="Incredibly Shocking with Some Incredibly Hilarious Parts"></head><body><p>Having seen Clerks II, I thought that I had seen one of the more shocking movies around but it pales in comparison to this movie.  People with prudish attitudes should definitely stay home and even open minded people like myself will have some issues as to how far the movie will go.<br /><br />This movie seemed like a long joke that stretched so far that I started to get a headache after the first hour.  Borat (Cohen) seemed to want to do really outrageous thing to unsuspecting audiences (we have seen a lot of similar things on YouTube but some of the people in the film seem so generally nice that you feel especially bad with the jokes played on them especially the nice old couple that rent a bed and breakfast to Borat and his companion.<br /><br />Some of the scenes are gut-wrenchingly funny with a lot of "guy" humor especially when Borat says some shocking things to a bunch of women feminists.  Others cross the line especially some of the sexually explicit humor between Borat and his companion.<br /><br />I give this movie just under four stars but I preferred the previously mentioned Clerks II over it for overall humor (at least I did not get a headache from that film).</p></body></html>

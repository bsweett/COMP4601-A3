<meta name="summary" content="Wooden Ships and Iron Men.  Crackles with authenticity!"></head><body><p>This movie is the most authentic presentation of the age of "wooden ships and iron men" ever to grace the silver screen.  There is simply no doubt about that.  The viewer is literally transported and immersed into the brutal and harsh service of the Royal Navy during the era of the Napoleonic Wars.  Russell Crowe perfectly portrays Captain Jack Aubrey ("lucky Jack") of the Patrick O'Brian novels.  The acting, sets, everything, simply crackle with authenticity.  The attention to detail in this film is astounding.<p>The storyline is not bad either, although in my opinion it moves a bit slowly.  But the relatively slow pace of the storyline is for a purpose, to draw the viewer into the subtle nuances that the film is trying to convey--that this was a hard age, the Royal Navy of the times was a brutal and merciless service which brooked no disobedience and yet was not lacking in humanity.  Russell Crowe portrays a Captain Aubrey who is both harsh and humane in an age of hardship and adventure.<p>I deprived this film of the fifth star because I did feel that the storyline could have been made to move at a brisker pace without sacrificing the nuances that the film accomplishes so well.  Others may disagree, and I can understand that.  It may be that with repeated viewings I too will decide that this is a five-star film.  In any case, it is an excellent film, featuring excellent performances, authenticity, and an interesting storyline.</p></body></html>

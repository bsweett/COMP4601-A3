The setting was mostly grim, on a rainy day, in a cell, in a room with fluoro-green colour, on the top floor of an office building, and so forth.  It truly excelled in putting the audience on the edge and enabling the audience to feel the pain and grosteque that the people were going through.  The movie didn't intend to have the audience empathise or feeling sorry for the main character who was imprisoned for fifteen years.  Rather, we were more intrigued to find the cause of imprisonment.  Naturally, the ending was as disturbing as the movie was and it didn't disappoint.  If you  think that the ending would be the imprisoned main character gotten his final revenge from his captor, you would be hugely disappointed because the theme of this movie would be running off the tangent in every sense of the way.  When classical music was playing whilst the torture was going on, it gave this movie a haunting but lasting beauty that would imprint in audience's mind for many years to come.  By no means, I'm making a comparison here but if you have watched "Fight Club" before starring Norton and Pitt, you know what you are to expect from "Old Boy".  As a word of percaution, this movie is not for the faint-hearted.  I squirmed quite a few times in this instance.  Highly recommended and totally deserved the accolade that it gotten from the Cannes Festival two years before.</p></body></html>

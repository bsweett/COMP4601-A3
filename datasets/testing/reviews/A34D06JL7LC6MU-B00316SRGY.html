<meta name="summary" content="The Best Film of 2008"></head><body><p>Even after watching Gran Torino for the third time I still believe it's the best film of 2008. It remains the most profound and heartwrenching moviegoing experience I've had with any film of 2008 and, beyond that, it's the rare kind of film that can truly make you laugh while simultaneously packing an emotional wallop. Despite a large box-office take and all sorts of accolades from moviegoers, the film escape any sort of awards for it's elderly leading man and poignant script. The Academy missed a real winner this year.<br /><br />Director Clint Eastwood stars as racist Korea veteran Walt Kowalski. The film opens at the funeral of Walt's wife, where he growls and sneers at the sight of his grandchildren and even his own grown children whom he views as disappointments. As one of his sons comment, "Dad's still living in the '50s."<br /><br />Walt lives in an area of Detroit populated by gangs of various demographics and next door lives a family of Hmong people. Thao (Bee Vang), one of Walt's neighbors, is pressured by a local gang to try and steal Walt's vintage, 1972 Gran Torino. Thao's attempted theft of the car is what, essentially, kickstarts the rest of the film in which Walt reluctantly grows to both like and appreciate the Hmong family next door.<br /><br />This poorly written synopsis sounds like the set-up for a typical movie exploring racism in the 21st century and it's consequences, but Gran Torino is thankfully much more than that.<br /><br />The film has many great scenes; Eastwood's "get off my lawn" line has already been immortalized but it is the lines that follow that are truly memorable. I, unfortunately, am unable to quote them here. Other scenes, like Walt confronting a trio of black men harassing Thao's sister and, of course, the ending come to mind, at least as a way of comparing the way the film balances humor and pathos.<br /><br />The ending packs one hell of a wallop although some people may see it as a sort of anticlimax. I was even disappointed with the ending briefly but it's really the most appropriate way for it to end. It's both beautiful and brilliant.<br /><br />There's nothing elaborate about the film; no showy cinematography, no elaborate set design. It's really a simple movie that is not without it's flaws. The scenes with Walt and Martin the barber (John Carroll Lynch) for example seem unrealistic and serve no real purpose beyond comic relief. As the scenes are quite amusing though, it's only a minor flaw.<br /><br />The other complaint I have is about the acting, particularly by those playing the Hmong characters. Much of it is very unsatisfactory and unconvincing. In fact, many of these actor's almost seem to reading off of far away cue cards.<br /><br />This is balanced out however by Eastwood, who has said this will be his final screen performance. He's a real revelation here. It could be argued that he does little more than growl, sneer, and spit venomous/humorous racial remarks and, yes, he does quite a bit of that. However, besides being very convincing, Eastwood can do more with a growl than some actors can do with an entire Shakespeare soliloquy. Despite the ignorance and overall bigotry of the character, Eastwood makes Walt human, sympathetic, and ultimately lovable. It's not only one of the best male lead performances of 2008, but one of Eastwood's all time greatest performances.<br /><br />Overall, Gran Torino is a great film in the purest sense of the word. You may not agree that it is the single best film of 2008 but you'll be hard-pressed to find a film that will make you laugh and cry equally as hard in a span of less than 2 hours.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></body></html>

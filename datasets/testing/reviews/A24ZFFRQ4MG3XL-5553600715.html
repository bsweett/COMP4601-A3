You won't be able to understand this until after you've seen it,  but, once you've seen it entirely, the movie isn't really scary (this will make sense once you've watched it).  The whole movie had an erie sense about it being that it was set in the countryside in post war time in a big castle type property with many many doorways in it.  Nicole Kidman has two children in the movie who can't be exposed to the light and this leads to doors being locked and curtains always drawn.  The caretakers in and of themselves are a bit freaky, but the main focus are the noises that are heard throughout the house coming from 'The Others'.  You really have to see this.  I can't say too much more without giving anything away, but it will scare you silly and everyone does an excellent job acting in this.  I love it and could see it quite a few times. It's great and gripping and will have you on the edge of your seat for sure.</p></body></html>

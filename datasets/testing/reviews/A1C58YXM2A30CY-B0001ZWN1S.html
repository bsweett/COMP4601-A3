If you're respectful, he'll do you a favor.  If not, well -- swim with the fishes.<br /><br />Mario Puzo's novel comes to life with the five crime families sorting out their turf in 1946 gangsterland New York.<br /><br />Behind the parties and the family togetherness there's an undercurrent of competitiveness that rears its head with the Solotso guys who want to make some narcotics sales and thus invite the Corleones for a piece of the action and thus help the family businesses.<br /><br />Things go from bad to worse for the Corleone family.  Their refusal to get into narcotics gets Brando's character (Vito) shot and near death.  His boys go into action but at the risk of getting killed, decide to meet Bruno for the ultimate show-down.  And hey, let's get rid of that cop that is on Solotso's payroll.<br /><br />Great film:  1940's gangland is tough, with their Fedora hats and cool 40s Chevy's rolling around.  I almost expected some tommyguns!<br /><br />I was reminded in the re-watch about the horse's head in the bed.  Don't cross the family!<br /><br />Robert Duval is Tom, the family's lawyer, basically.  He is the level-headed, logical one who wants to do business without blood.  Mike (Al Pacino) the "war hero" wants back in on the family business and to protect his father.  Sonny just wants to blow everyone away!<br /><br />The film's complex story and interweaving plot make a plot summary difficult.  You just have to see it.  Intense drama with some comedic elements, it clearly deserved the Academy Awards from the 70s.  Character-driven story at its best!<br /><br />No, it does not glorify the Mafia and teach a generation that being a crime lord is a career choice!  It's a story of family and corruption, risk and torment.<br /><br />Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and winning for Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay.<br /><br />Great film!<br /><br />Get the works!:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAA">The Godfather DVD Collection (The Godfather/ The Godfather - Part II/ The Godfather - Part III)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NTPDSW">The Godfather - The Coppola Restoration Giftset (The Godfather / The Godfather Part II / The Godfather Part III) [Blu-ray</a>]</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Mildly entertaining no-brainer without a soul"></head><body><p>Yes, Sahara does take place in the same universe as the monumental flop Raise the Titanic, a universe where the Titanic sunk in one piece. Keep your eyes open during the opening credits and you'll see a newspaper clipping of the ship being towed into New York.<br /><br />Matthew McConaughey takes over the role of Dirk Pitt from Richard Jordan (whoever he is) and teams up with Steve Zahn and Penelope Cruise for a film that should offer much more action and excitement than Raise the Titanic offered. It's doesn't really succeed.<br /><br />Dirk Pitt and his pal Al Giordino are professional divers/explorers who sneak off from their ordinary salvage duties to find a legendary ship packed full of treasure in a warn-torn part of Africa. Penelope Cruz is a W.H.O. doctor (I could have made a joke there) investigating a series of mysterious deaths and ends up on the wrong side of a local dictator/warlord. Naturally Pitt saves her and is rewarded with loads of foot-soldiers out to kill him.<br /><br />The treasure hunt/ecology plot could have been entertaining but nothing really amazing happens. It could have worked as an Indiana Jones-lite but it's completely free of any of the iconic or classic scenes that make that franchise so famous. What we get is a lightweight James Bond kind of film with no real edge or excitement. The anonymous direction doesn't help either and the whole thing seems to drag along rather than being a breathless ride.<br /><br />None of this is the fault of the actors. McConaughey and Zahn are watchable as always, though I would have liked to have seen William H. Macy and Delroy Lindo given more to do. Since, I've never read any of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels I cannot compare but whoever adapted the novel of Sahara into the screenplay forgot to put anything resembling spectacle or epic into it.<br /><br />Sahara is good for a single viewing only. There's nowt in here that make you come back for more. Which is rather worrying since Paramount bought the rights to 3 of Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels. They ought to make them better than this, but it's still superior to the similarly plotted National Treasure.<br /><br />The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with not-too-spectacular Dolby 5.1 sound design.</p></body></html>

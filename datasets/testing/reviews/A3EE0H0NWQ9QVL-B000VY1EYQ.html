<meta name="summary" content="A Woman's Life (Bitterroot and Honey) Pie"></head><body><p>It's hard not to resist the obvious metaphor that Adrienne Shelly's final work `Waitress' is a wonderful slice of life, but a film this rich deserves more than banal clich&eacute;s.  Nevertheless, the film is very satisfying from start to finish and is a must for anyone who wants to commiserate (soothing ginger pie) over the wounds of misogyny in an understandably jaded feminine existence.  Much like `Volver' in the sense that it is mainly a women's affair, the film has a power to satisfy anyone with a palette for well-made movies that are cleverly told and leave a lingering aftertaste.<br /><br />`The Waitress' is about, well.., a waitress.  Jenna (played true-to-life by Keri Russell, brimming with a wide range of emotion), has one passion in life:  making her pies.  With great pride she presents a host of different sweetmeats, each with its own distinctive ingredients and descriptive titles to mirror life.  Her great ambition is to enter her works in a "United States Pie" contest; one that would sustain her enough to get out from under her shackling existence with louse-spouse husband, Earl (Jeremy Sisto).  His insecurity manifests itself by cueing his reluctant wife to say and confess things she doesn't mean, and by jealously guarding money that may buy out aspects of independence in her existence.  (Their heated, one-way arguments set up for unseasoned rhubarb pie.)  Add to that the ingredient of an unwanted pregnancy, and we're set up with an intent attention to the details of Jenna's story.<br /><br />Most of the focus is at Joe's Pie Diner, the main outlet for her passion.  Here she finds friendship with two fellow waitresses who are looking for respite and romance in their own lives.  Becky (Shelly) finds sparks by answering personals ads; while spirited Dawn (Cheryl Hines) finds a side dish while caring for an invalid husband.  All their lives overlap one another, even with growling cook/manager, Cal, who barks out orders with unrelenting grouchiness.  They all share about the same misery and rejuvenation (including "Falling in love [Mousse] pie").  For all her trouble, Jenna gets some just desserts in her own life.  First of all, she musters up some sweetness for elderly diner owner, Joe (Andy Griffith), who can on a turn be scathingly ornery or genuinely sweet.  Next in line, is her obstetrician Dr. Jim Pomatter (Nathan Fillion), whom she resentfully notes has replaced her familiar female doctor.  He's from Connecticut and is in some ways out of place in their deep Southern community.  Nevertheless, he manages to tear down her jaundiced demeanor and provide a slice of sweet (potato) pie.<br /><br />The extra ingredients make 'The Waitress' special.  The sensual construction of fast-lapsed pies with Jenna's own narration is well-crafted, and the music makes each scene a symphony.  Earl brings foreboding music with jaggedly edited scenes.  Jenna and Jim provide classical music one notch lower than Tchycovsky's `Romeo and Juliet,' complete with spinning camera angles, and a fussy little toddler in the diner inspires the horror of Wagner.  Topped off with some great dialogue, including narrated letters to her unborn baby that work like an unbosoming soliloquy, and we have a movie of distinct perfection.<br /><br />(`The Waitress' reminded me of loose associations to other movies, including `Alice Doesn't Live Here Any More' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000286RO8">Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore</a> and `Terms of Endearment,'<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000055ZF6">Terms of Endearment</a> but these are only hints for the distinctive flavor of this movie.  Noting the nature of Adrienne Shelly`s tragic death, misfortune played an even worse role in her own life. )</p></body></html>

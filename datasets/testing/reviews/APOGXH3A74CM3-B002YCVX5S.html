We picked this up to watch with friends and before we started watching it, I cringed when I learned that one of these friends was squeamish when it comes to Tarantino films, but to her credit she was willing to give it a viewing.<br /><br />Chapter One (worth the price of the DVD) sucked in the group of us with riveting performances, dialog, and cinematography.  It set the tone for the rest of the film.<br /><br />I know a lot of other viewers dinged the film slightly for Quentin's little idiosyncrasies.  That doesn't bother me a bit, in fact I've come to expect them.  They're just his way of putting his stamp on the film.<br /><br />What was most striking to me, was the fact that Tranantino is perfecting (given the right story) his craft.  The way he built up the scenes to shocking, often surprising conclusions was phenomenal.<br /><br />The actors' performances were outstanding, though Brad Pitt is included more for comic relief than anything else.  Christoph Waltz and Melanie Laurent easily stole this film. The film was more about story and performance, masterfully told, than violence.  The squeamish friend enjoyed it, and Quentin seems to have redeemed himself in her eyes.<br /><br />Stunning cinema!</p></body></html>

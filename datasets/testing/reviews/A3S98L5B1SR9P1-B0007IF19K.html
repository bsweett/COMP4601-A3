<meta name="summary" content="Ray"></head><body><p>Ray is a fantastic tribute to a true genius. The entire cast is superb and we see Ray as he was, the good, the bad and the ugly. We get a good sense of the timeline of Ray's life and get a good idea of what the business of music was all about in that era. We actually see a man blend soul, gospel, rock and country music (a recipe for disaster) into something that people actually loved! There are many good lessons to be learned here, Ray learned them well and this film will help generations to come to know those lessons.</p></body></html>

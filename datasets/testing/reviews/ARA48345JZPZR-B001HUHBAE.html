That's the response from Robert Graysmith's frightened and increasingly estranged wife to the above statement and the fixation it represents.  Why indeed?  Because just as the newspapers, police and citizenry of Northern California had been siezed by the terror and frustration of the random murders perpetrated by the elusive, self-proclaimed Zodiac, Graysmith's interest in discovering his identity has turned into all-consuming obsession.  And we come to this moment only in the last third of this movie, as the leadup to this has been a fascinating police procedural unfolding with the same mistaken assumptions, false leads, jurisdictional problems (several different counties and investigations proceeding in unknowing parallel), and missed opportunities that occurred in the real case.<br /><br />I say "fascinating" because I found it so.  I have a fondness for films depicting how professionals go about their business, and I have great admiration for David Fincher's exploration of the day-to-day wear and tear it exerts upon those involved in the agonizingly slow and painstaking work required trying to capture a taunting, headline-hungry, cruel and despicable monster like the Zodiac.  However, if you are looking for a thriller such as Fincher's own "7even" you should give this a pass, as he is after different elements here.<br /><br />It is a long film at plus 2-1/2 hrs, but I was thoroughly engrossed in the atmosphere and tension of the film.  I remember this period (60's-70's), and Fincher's evocation of San Francisco, the city and its culture then, is spot on.  I found his camera perspectives and framing coming at this material from all sorts of angles, high and low, over and around, far and near, both smooth and fresh. Yet his style doesn't overwhelm the detailed and intricate telling of the story, but rather enhances it.<br /><br />The cast is first rate in all departments, and it would be unfair to single out any of the leads as this is true ensemble work. Let me just echo some other reviewers in stating that Mark Ruffalo as the true-life Inspector Steve McQueen modeled Bullitt on and Anthony Edwards as his less colorful but solid partner, Robert Downey's flamboyant, talented but self-destructing reporter, and finally Gyllenhaal's increasingly compulsive cartoonist all have fine scenes, well done. Elias Koteas, Donal Logue, Brian Cox, Chloe Sevigney, Charles Fleischer and John Carroll Lynch all do solid supporting work.<br /><br />Working from factual material including the eponymous book Graysmith ultimately produced about the case, Fincher has created an intricate and complex look at the spell cast by a vile celebrity-seeking, notorious monster/nobody whose apprehension is always just beyond reach. He tells a big story with deftness and great craft.  It won't be a film for everyone, but I was in it for this one to the end.  Movies are as long as they need to be, and this one is no exception, and considering they have telescoped nearly two decades of this pursuit into less than three hours, Fincher and company have done so with energy and imagination.</p></body></html>

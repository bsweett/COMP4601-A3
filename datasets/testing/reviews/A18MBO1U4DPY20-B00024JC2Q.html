In any case, watch this film if they're showing it on television or rent it. Do not buy because it's not really one of those films you buy. Some scenes were funny and it is just the perfect movie for the "three star" grade. Cheers.<br /><br />Want a 5 star comedy film? Watch Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle.</p></body></html>

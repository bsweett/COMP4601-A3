The idea for pitting the villains from the two franchises against each other first emerged in a Dark Horse Comic Book by the same name that appeared in the late 1980's and early 1990's.  The franchise then moved into video games, both in the coin-op machines and the computer and game console platforms.  At long last the franchise made it to the big screen.  The result proves to be a mixed bag for the fans.<br /><br />First, there is the plot.  The story is actually pretty cool.  Without spoiling much, a satellite owned by Weyland Enterprises reveals a structure resembling pyramids reminscient of several ancient cultures buried beneath a think sheet of ice in Antarctica.  Charles Bishop Weyland, played by Lance Henrikson, sees the discovery and exploration as an opportunity to leave a lasting legacy.  So, he rounds up a team of experts including Alexa Woods, an environmental guide (played by Sanna Lathan) and Sebastian de Rosa, an expert in ancient cultures (played by Raoul Bova).  Shortly after they arrive, a weird set of circumstances occur, and they find themselves in "the middle of a war."<br /><br />The good points about the plot include tying in elements from both movie franchises.  Weyland Enterprises might be recognized as the company in the 'Alien' series.  Furthermore, Henrickson's character, Charles Bishop Weyland, is the model for the Bishop character from 'Aliens.'  The downside of the plot is that it became too predictable too early.  Fans of the comic series will be able to predict how some of the plotlines will turn out.  On top of that, setting the movie in 2004 makes it seem unlikely that no record of the Aliens would have been recorded before they make their appearance in the future set in the Alien series.<br /><br />Next, the characters are a mixed bag as well.  Henriksen was a great addition to the cast.  He is a recognizeable face from the 'Alien' franchise, and his presence helps ground this movie.  Sanaa Lathan was a welcome choice for the female lead.  Although she is recognizeable from some of her other film roles ('Out of Time,' 'Blade'), she is not established superstar.  She and some of the other lesser known actors were refreshing.  However, if you have seen 'Alien' or read the comic books, you'll have a good idea of who is going to survive, and who won't.<br /><br />Other issues:  this movie could have used another half hour.  Other than some scattered appearances by the Aliens and the Predator species, you don't really see much of them for the first half hour.  There was just too much build up for the last third, some of it could have been worked into the spaces between action scenes.  There are a few continuity problems.  Most of these problems have been addressed by other reviewers, and are apparently the result in a last minute change of the rating by the studio.  Finally, the movie just didn't seem to have the grand scale that a combination of the two franchises would have seemed to have warranted.  This was a good story, but perhaps an off-Earth locale could have allowed for a larger scope to the film.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the movie, I have a copy on DVD for my collection, and I imagine I will watch it several more times.  However, some of the decisions for this movie could have been better.  I heard mixed reviews for the movie before I saw it, and I'm not sure what my expectations were, but the movie really didn't meet them.  The action scenes are pretty good for the most part, but there should have been more of them and a more balanced presentation of the rivalry.  This film doesn't have the suspense, tension, or mystery of the independent franchises either.<br /><br />The DVD has a few good extras, the best of which is the 'First Look' feature that goes behind the scenes.  There are some items on the DVD that don't seem to belong there.  This would include a promo for the Super Bowl that will be on Fox in 2005 that was shot sometime last year.  Not to mention, there are some previews for other movies that do not enhance this DVD at all.  Its borderline offensive that the extra content you buy on this DVD are actually promotions for other movies as opposed to features for this movie.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a movie that fans of the "Alien' and 'Predator' franchises need to see.  I'd generally recommend it to other fans.  Although not very gory, there is still some gore, but what might be more troubling to young viewers are the aliens themselves, which can be a bit frightening.  I'd give the movie either 3.5 stars, maybe four, but the DVD was lacking, and warrants 2.5 or 3 at best.</p></body></html>

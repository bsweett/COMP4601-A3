<meta name="summary" content="The funniest film of 2009?"></head><body><p>I was skeptical about seeing The Hangover.  After all, the previews weren't that great, and I was unfamiliar with the cast.  But a friend of mine went to see it...then wanted to go see it again.  I've never known this guy to pay for a movie twice, so I was intrigued.  Could it be that could?<br /><br />It was.  The Hangover is perhaps the funniest film of 2009; arguably the funniest since Tropic Thunder.  The film follows four guys--Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper, and Zack Galifianakis--as they take their buddy on a road trip before his wedding...then promptly lose him one drunken night.  They wake up the next morning, their lives in a mess, their car missing, and a tiger in the bathroom.  What follows is comedic gold.<br /><br />All three leads are phenomenal, with near-perfect comedic timing.  Supporting roles from contemporary farce mainstays Ken Jeong and Rob Riggle help round things out, while Mike Tyson's cameo is pitch-perfect.  Todd Phillips, the director, also helmed Old School...which, while a funny movie, really shouldn't be compared to The Hangover.  I haven't see a comedy like this in ages.  I think you'll agree: for b*lls to the wall humor, The Hangover is worth every penny.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Non stop action with a climatic showdown"></head><body><p>I must admit that even for a girl, I think this is one of the best nail-biting, or fist smashing if you prefer, action movies that has hit the screen in the past years. This movie came out when I was six years old and along with the Conan movies, which were one of the first movies I have ever seen, made Schwarzenegger my favorite action hero. Since my father had the terminator hair cut and even resembled him, I was sucked into a world of fantastic movies, which never gave me nightmares and pretty much defined my style in books and movies for years to come.<br /><br />Predator is one of those movies that have never received a bad word from anyone I know and that is rare these days. This movie is a smoothie of Aliens, Commando and Rambo producing a fusion of sci-fi and horror special effects that are a guarantee show stopper. The monster itself is not shy, it starts killing right away and it does make plenty of appearance so that the audience doesn't have to wonder if there is a creature at all like in some movies I've seen (where there's a lot of waiting for nothing).<br /><br />The action unfolds as an alien space ship disposes of a small aircraft and drops it on out dear planet Earth. Aboard the one person vessel is a hunter who hunts for the pleasure, it's like a fishing trip during the weekend, and the people are the fish. As it drops on the jungles of Central America little does he know that he will meet his match there as Dutch (Schwarzenegger) and his CIA fellow officers are assigned to help rescue a hostage from the guerrilla fighters who occupy the jungle. Some of the bad guys will become snacks for the biomechanoid, but he will bump heads in the jungle with some tough guys who are not going down without a battle. The action and fight sequences were very impressive and the hunt and traps that were set up to catch the hunter were really fun to watch. Unfortunatelly, against the lush, green backdrop the Predator is deadly, fast, shoots lasers and even turns invisible and proves that he's the master of camouflage; he's a real hunter. Apparently Arnold took quite a beating during filming as he fell from tall waterfalls, swam in ice cold water for days and was engorged in mud for weeks running on steep hills.<br /><br />Dutch takes the role of the dog catcher and takes us though the wild jungles on the hunt, and I can safely say that this movie never bores. The ending was spine tingling and intense and provided a satiating finale to this robust movie. Great action flick whether you like terrestrial boogey men or not.<br /><br />-Kasia S.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A glimpse at royalty"></head><body><p>Helen Mirren is superb in her portrayal of the Queen during the traumatic time surrounding the beloved Princess Diana's death. Queen Elizabeth II is caught in a very hard place when her public seems to demand an outward show of emotion and the Queen wishes to hold fast to the tradition of private mourning. The film only gives us a glimpse into royal life and a dramatization of actual events, but it's enough to give the viewer a small idea of how difficult this period was for the Royals and the people of England when they lost their beautiful 'fairytale Princess'. My heart also broke for her children all over again.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

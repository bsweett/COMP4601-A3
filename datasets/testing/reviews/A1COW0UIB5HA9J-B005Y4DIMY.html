<meta name="summary" content="A masterpiece of terror!"></head><body><p>A man named Frank (Sean Chapman) has brought home with him an unusual puzzle-box which opened a portal to a demonic dimension where the fiendish Cenobites, a ruthless gang of demons who are into pain and pleasure lead by Pinhead (Doug Bradly)whom tortured him and ripped him apart down to hell. Several years later, Frank's brother Larry (Andrew Robinson) is married to a new wife named Julia (Claire Higgens) as they move into Frank's abanonded house which maybe dirty and damp but would need some cleaning improvement to make it a perfect place. Unfortunately when Larry spills a little of his blood, it unleashes Frank back from the dead as he was Julia's former lover along time ago as now she helps him to kill people so he can be whole again and be free of the curse. The daughter Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) discovers who is behind the horrible murders that have been happening and makes a special bargain with the devilish Cenobites.<br /><br />A masterful blend of H.P. Lovecraft style horror, S&M and fantasy combined thanks to the mind of Clive Barker who wrote and directed this movie. Based on his novel "The Hellbound Heart", this movie sets as his debut movie and the movie that made him for what he is today. The film deals with sexual perversion and the occult, it does offer some graphic gore with disturbing imagery including subject matter that pushed the limits back then as it's still disturbing today. Pinhead became a horror icon much like Michael or Jason or Freddy or Leatherface, the creatures are very imaginative including the cenobites and the special effects are well done for it's time. Christopher Young's score is chilling and magnificent, the acting is kind of bad at times but forget about that cause this is an atmospheric, scary and gory shockfeast you'll never forget.<br /><br />This DVD contains excellent picture and sound quality with great extras like interviews, commentary, original featurette from the 2000 DVD, DVD-Rom screenplays, trailers, TV Spots, Still Galleries and storyboard gallery.</p></body></html>

I thought this movie was pretty funny, but definitely not as funny as the first one.  And all this star talent?  What a waste!  Robert DeNiro was great.  I thought Dustin Hoffman's and Barbra Streisand's talent was put to waste.  They were good, but corny and not too funny.  I thought Ben Stiller was brilliant.<br /><br />There was too much going on, I thought.  Too many plot lines, and it was confusing.<br /><br />I give it 3 stars.<br /><br />MC White said:  Just a'iiiight!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Finally, a horror movie to write home about"></head><body><p>I was impressed with the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre back in 2003...<br /><br />That's about it.  It just seems that no matter how hard they try, movie execs can't seem to release a decent horror film, something gritty and disturbing and downright horrifying.  They just can't do it.<br /><br />And then there was Saw.<br /><br />This movie is amazing in the fact that it breaks down to a simple formula of twists and thrills, bypasses the special effects and CGI crap that pollutes too many scary movies these days and focuses on something that could take place, something that could really happen versus the faux thrills expidited by cheap ghost storys and sci-fi.  This is the type of movie that will leave you disturbed long after you watch it.  You'll think about it a week, two weeks, a month later while you lay awake and wonder if there really is a man that sick and twisted...<br /><br />Yes...<br /><br />He is out there...<br /><br />So by now EVERYONE knows the premise.  Two men wake up in a nasty restroom chained to oposite ends and theres a dead man in the center of the room.  They both have choices to make, clues to unravel in order to make it out alive.<br /><br />That's all I'm going to tell you...<br /><br />Trust me, if you haven't seen Saw by now you need to watch this movie.  It is truly an origional film with genuine scares and real backbone.  Not for the faint of heart, but for the horror fan in us all, the fan whos getting increasingly preturbed with the lack of scares and the redundancy in recent horror instalments...this is for you my friends...<br /><br />Relish in it.<br /><br />It won't come again.<br /><br />Not for a long time...<br /><br />(Actually, Saw II is even better...but I didn't see that coming!)</p></body></html>

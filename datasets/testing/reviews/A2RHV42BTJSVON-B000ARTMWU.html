<meta name="summary" content="A well-done suspense/horror movie..."></head><body><p>I don't want to ruin anything, so if you don't want anything spoiled, skip the next paragraph:<br /><br />  First of all, to those whom say that the "twist" doesn't tie in with the other 3/4 of the film, IT DOES!!!! I watched the whole thing, and although a little confusing, the twist does make sense with the rest of the movie, so stop your B****ing.!<br /><br />  Okay, now, for the film itself, although, it is french, and I knew there was sex, I wish that it was not quite as explicit, but its french, so I knew it was coming... Don't say I didn't warn you, the first 20mins, has some HIGHLY sexual stuff in it... If you're not a typical horror freak(which I'm not, I don't enjoy nudity and sex onscreen, just GORE&SCARES), than you've been forwarned...<br /><br />  Now the story is simple enough, a girl and her friend are at their house, and a PSYCO comes in and slaughters everyone except the girl and her friend... What follows from there is not as predictable as you'de think... It is a very sick little horror film, and despite what reviewers say, FAR above par as far as writing, acting, and directing goes in this genre... It is WELL above average...<br /><br />  So, if you can get past the small portion that's dubbed in, you'll enjoy the film, as long as you either A. don't mind sexual content in movies. Or B. Can ignore a moderate amount of it... And of course, as long as you looooooove oodles of gore!!! Although I do wish there was a bit more of it, it delivered the goods VERY well!!!<br /><br />  So, I hope you enjoy it.!<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy</p></body></html>

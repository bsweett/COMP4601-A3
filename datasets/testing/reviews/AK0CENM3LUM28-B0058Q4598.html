On the surface, this is rather standard science fiction fare - a strange alien from beyond the stars comes to visit us, is treated poorly by evil earth bureaucrats, and uses his strange and amazing powers to exact well-deserved vengeance on an uncaring populous. And, to a certain extent, that surface plot is beautifully polished to a high shine - Reeves works very well here as a dispassionate alien, and the special effects (though highly amusing from a scientific standpoint) are wonderfully done.<br /><br />The sub-plot - that aliens are trying to save the earth, a rare and precious resource, from the ravages of humans - is an interesting twist on the `benevolent aliens' genre, which is to say, it's a nice change of pace to see humanity threatened with extinction from a "nice" species instead of from the usual slavering carnivores. Strangely, though, the plot kind of breaks down at this point - Reeves has been sent to earth with a very simple message: Stop mucking up the earth, or our superior technology will destroy you. Oddly, though, he never seems very interested in divulging his simple message. When rebuffed at his initial request to speak to the U.N., he clams up for much of the rest of the movie, and - in the end - only the love interest has heard from his mouth how, precisely, to prevent future attacks on the planet. Not the best way to disseminate an important message.<br /><br />For that matter, why discuss this with this world leaders at all? The aliens seem to be at least slightly aware that governments and leaders can be corrupt, so why not go straight to the plebes with, I don't know, a gigantic space billboard? I would think that any species capable of hacking our space satellites could use that technology to decipher our language and spell out a nice warning, viewable from space, set to translate into a different earth language every hour or so. But I guess stopping every watch (and pacemakers?) on earth for a day might do the trick just as well, if only you told people WHY you were doing it. Ah well.<br /><br />Apart from the Fridge Logic above, I did think this was a decent movie, although I will admit to not having seen the original classic, which probably colors my judgment somewhat. Reeves does very well here, as an emotionless alien, and the overall message is an interesting one, even if the delivery is a bit wonky. I really could have done with a lot less of the "cute" 'I-hate-my-stepmom' kid, even if the Wangst portrayal was probably fairly accurately done.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="3.5; A film too big even for New York"></head><body><p>Our local theatre only has one screen so some movies eventually get shown several weeks or even a month after the release date. But there was a strange rarity when Spider-Man 3 along with Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End where shown the same time everyone else got to. So rather than watching the film a month later with all the disappointment and negative comments, I discovered along with everyone else that the third Spidey installment was just...iffy. Not outright terrible by any means but it just is; it doesn't transcend the genre and go from a good comic book movie to a great movie period like 2 was but rather this was just entertaining but not consistently.<br /><br />The film starts out with Peter Parker/Spider-Man happy as can be with a great girlfriend with Mary Jane who's on Broadway and Peter thinking about proposing. But the attention gets to Peter's head and he becomes a little arrogant and oblivious to certain problems which gets worse when Harry Osborne, furious with the knowledge Parker may be responsible for his father's death, is coming after him.<br /><br />As if they're needed to be more problems, escaped convict Flint Marko, the now-prime suspect in Uncle Ben's murder, has been mutated thanks to an experiment and can change his body's composition to mimic sand. Then of course there's Eddie Brock with a mind for being New York's top photographer, and a strange substance that latches onto Peter and turns him into something no one wants him to be.<br /><br />PHEW! Man it was tough writing all that because as most people have already said, this film is stuffed to the point where the button its pants would fly off and hit someone in the face by now. There's just way too much going on from storylines to villains to scenes and set-pieces yet at the same time the film doesn't have the strong pacing the second film had which is odd to say the least. Each storyline in essence deserves its own film so to boil it all down to one 2 hour 13 minute movie makes it too scattered. Then of course there's individual scenes (I highly suggest skipping chapter 36 to make the film run much smoother) to dialogue, handling of "emo Peter" complete with Conor Oberst haircut to the introduction of Gwen Stacy which seems to be written in as if to say to Spider-Man fans "see? we have Gwen too, now watch us".<br /><br />However, the effects, save a few scenes have definately gotten better, and the slightly darker tone is quite appropriate and even welcome and of course the action scenes are just as awesome as they should be. And despite the awful dialogue (at times), the actors do at least do a respectable job with their roles like Thomas Haden Church as Marko/Sandman and even Topher Grace, an oddball choice, is actually good at playing Brock. This is the kind of film where there's enough great parts but it comes after bad or even laughable parts so you're kind of glad there's at least something good in it.<br /><br />It's obviously not the worst comic book movie; what with Ghost Rider, Elektra and the Punisher out there but in a strange way, this is like the Batman Forever of the franchise: it's watchable sure but man, problems are coming out of its pores.</p></body></html>

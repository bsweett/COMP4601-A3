Well, lesson learned: don't believe everything you read or hear about a movie. This movie deserves accolades and applause for being one of the best movies made last year.<p>"Road To Perdition" is the story of a man with a mission to avenge the death of his wife and son, all the while reconnecting to the remaining son he never knew. Tom Hanks leads this all-star cast, Jude Law, Stanley Tucci, Jennifer Jason  Leigh, and including the amazing Paul Newman who plays his role with dignity. Some people claim they can't see Hanks as a gangster, but he plays his role with both reserve and dignity. He is an actor, first and foremost, and he can carry off any role he plays.<p>But let's get to the real reason this film is amazing. First the script. Bringing back a 30's gangster drama, with a strong emphasis on drama. Sure there is a lot of killing and death in the film, but it is vital and relevant to the plot. It's a very strong story, as Hanks needs to do what he needs to do to carry out his new mission in life. From the moment the film opens to the closing credits, it's strong and real. <p>Some people complain about the pacing. While it is slow, it is the characters that drive it that speed, and spending every second with them is an amazing experience. If you want a shoot 'em up, crash and dash movie, move on: this movie isn't for you.<p>The true star of the film, though, is the incredible direction of Sam Mendes, and the absolutely beautiful cinematography. This is a film to be cherished, relished like a fine wine. Each scene is perfectly crafted to convey its purpose and meaning to the highest degree. It almost seems like you can watch each frame with the sound off, and it still resounds with strong emotional impact. Mendes has set a high bar in the art of filmmaking with his newest contribution.<p>The road was an incredible journey from start to finish. Sit back, relax, and enjoy this cinematic masterpiece.</p></body></html>

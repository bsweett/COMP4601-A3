<meta name="summary" content="Kept me guessing with a great cast and plot"></head><body><p>This is an above average thriller that takes place on a forbidding, windswept island facility for  the insane, including criminals, and it is set in the 1950s.  DiCaprio is a federal marshal who comes to the island to help find a supposedly escaped prisoner.  I can't say much more without spoiling it, but suffice to say that he gives a great performance, as do Ben Kingsley and Mark Ruffalo, as he continues his investigation and uncovers many secrets<br />--some of which he had hidden away in his own mind, regarding his tragic past and the life he used to have with his family.<br /><br />There are some very disturbing images throughout the films:  dead, frozen bodies in a concentration camp; other dead people; horrible conditions in the ward for the most dangerous prisoners, etc.  Be warned. This might not be for you if you are easily upset or prone to nightmares.<br /><br />Otherwise, enjoy!</p></body></html>

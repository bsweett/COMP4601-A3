The cool thing is that you can completely trash your expectations.  Heck, I couldn't rent it twice at blockbuster for this money.  Needless to say, I jumped in with both feet and landed safely into a film I thought was pretty cool.  Let's run with Lola!!<br /><br />-DUBBA DUBBA...<br />I had to watch the dubbed version.  I started with subtitles but this is a very visual film.  The limited dialogue simply sets the stage for the physical action and reinforces the point of the film.  So, it was more important to watch the action than hear the actor's actual German voices.  Most of the dubs were fair enough accept for Lola's boy friend; "GODDAM# IT! HE'S GONNA KILL ME!!!  WHAAAHAAAAHAAAA!!".  After that scene it got better.<br /><br />-THE POINT OF THE FILM<br />Though not a completely new concept, the film revolves around the idea that one little word, act or decision will dramatically change your fate and the fate of others.  This film, though a bit overly deliberate (what, we Germans?) still managed to be unique.  I'm not even going to tell you how this is presented because that's half the fun.<br /><br />-A FILM OF FAIR QUALITY<br />I would never call this great film making.  However, it's not at all bad either.  Like the concept, the execution was fairly deliberate.  I thought this made it more fun.  The acting was at least adequate, the story was unique enough and it actually had some exciting visual dynamics without going over the top... ...most of the time.<br /><br />-JUDGE NOT LEST YE BE JUDGED<br />Well the heck with that.  This film is full of stupid people.  Of course the question is never asked; "how could they be so stupid to begin with!"  I guess we're expected to roll with the premise as it was set up.  That's ok, but it certainly lurked in the back of my mind that these are not particularly good people we're investing our emotions in.  That kind of ruined the ending for me.  Possibly the dumbest thing about Lola is her unique talent which borders on being a super power; just ridiculous.<br /><br />-INTERESTING ANIMATION<br />I almost feel like I'm giving too much away by mentioning that there is animation at all.  But it's too late; there are animation sequences in this film.  They were actually visually exciting and accentuated the entire concept of the film.  It was almost like "Schoolhouse Rock" meets "Lizzy Maguire" meets "The Simpson's"; very Euro-groovy.  Please; no smart remarks about me even knowing about "Lizzy Maguire".  I do have a young daughter after all.  Anyway, I actually liked these somewhat crude but stylish interludes.<br /><br />-WAS MUSS ICH DENKEN? (What do I think?)<br />I thought it was "sehr gut".  It is actually a riveting film that has lots of action and only a little violence (mostly running, duh!).  If you like unique story telling with good production values and fair acting this might satisfy you.  The ending is a bit irksome to me for reasons I don't want to explain here for fear of spoilage.  However, it was inevitable considering the type of people we're dealing with.  I recommend watching with the dubbing due to the visual nature of the film.  I found it helpful anyway.  If you can buy it for the same price I did, all the better.  So hop on the Lola express; BOOM CHUCKA BOOM CHUCKA BOOM CHUCKA...<br /><br />Actors....3.8 stars<br />Visuals...4.7 stars<br />Story.....5.0 stars<br />  Average...4.5 stars</p></body></html>

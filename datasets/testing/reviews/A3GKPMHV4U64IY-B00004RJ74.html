<meta name="summary" content="Blood Sucking South of the Border"></head><body><p>This is really two movies in one.  First is the ultra-violent crime spree.  Second is the ultra-violent horror film.  Packaging used to concentrate on the first part so I avoided picking this one up until recently.<p>The Gecko brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarrantino) are running for the border and leaving bodies in their wake.  One brother is rather twisted.  They kidnap a family and manage to get safely across the border to Mexico.<p>Once in Mexico they head for a biker/trucker bar to make meet their contact.  Unfortunately, the bar is actually a front for hordes of vampires.  Much violence ensues until the final climactic battle.<p>A very interesting film but it does come off as two separate pieces.  There is the crime film and then the horror film as if the film makers had two ideas and only one budget.  My biggest problem was the sheer number of vampires.  There were so many they should have bled Mexico dry years ago.<p>This film is followed by two sequels but they do not have the same characters.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="GREAT GREAT GREAT... but some people did not get it..."></head><body><p>I liked this film very much.<br /><br />The screenplay (adapted by the author of the original stageplay) is very well written. The story revolves around four people (you know who) who meet pretty much by chance (how modern...) and keep falling in and out of love with each other. Sounds simple? It is not. They cheat, they hurt, they lie, they cry... all between four people.<br /><br />But to me, the most interesting thing about this screenplay is the way the passing of the time is shown. It is hard to explain... we follow small moments of each couple's life and... suddenly there are jumps forward where big chunks of story left unseen suddenly became past. Clever, simple and intelligent. Frankly I haven't seen a script like this in years.<br /><br />Now the actors... oh, the actors... you can't get any better. Roberts, Law, Portman and Owen are simply top. Enough said?<br /><br />Some people (in other reviews) seemed to feel bothered by the cruel/explicit language in this film (may I remind you this is rated R). According to them, people do not talk like this. Maybe not. But people tend to forget that this film is written like a game and a puzzle. Many times, the screenplay engages in word playing (something that comes from the original source of this material: the stage). In a way, the film kept some of the word puzzles (which is not how people talk). Strange: nobody complains when Shakespeare does that... (laughs)<br /><br />On the other side, the screenplay clearly exaggerates some explicitness because in this operation lies many of the feelings we would not see had they done otherwise. The explicitness here may not be real... but the feelings are. And those dialogues shine because they go higher than reality.<br /><br />So maybe 50% of the dialogues may be too explicit or may be different from the way people talk... so what? in this film I think it is clearly justified... because other more subtler things than reality are at play. In fact, there is a lot of reality here that is put aside for (let's call it) poetic reasons... so the story can get to a certain point... so this character can end up this way... (think about the role coincidence plays here... think about all the things that would and could never happen in real life...) You really have to understand in order to enjoy.<br /><br />You don't really get this movie if you don't understand why the writer did what he did. And to me, the whole text is beautiful.<br /><br />A gem.</p></body></html>

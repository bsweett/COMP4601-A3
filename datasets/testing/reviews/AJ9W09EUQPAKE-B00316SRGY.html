<meta name="summary" content="Not Eastwood's finest"></head><body><p>Clint Eastwood is a powerful presence in this film, as Walt Kowalsky, an elderly Korean war veteran trapped in his hyper-masculine, racist, emotionally bared down persona. He is a widower, lonely, seeks refuge in his Gran Torino sports car and practical domestic tasks. He oozes growling, simmering fury at the invasion of his neighbourhood by Asian families 'Gooks, eggrolls, Charlie Chans'.<br /><br />The plot is a sort of grand redemption, road to calvary message as Walt finds himself unwillingly ensnared in the lives of the Korean youngsters next door to him, in particular Thao, a young man who initially tries to steal his car but emerges as a vulnerable youth in need of work and a father figure which Walt provides in his brusque, no-nonsense way (including a great scene where he educates the young Korean in savage, ball busting banter with his local Argentinian barber).<br /><br />As the tension develops, Walt, with his finger always metaphorically if not literally on the trigger of one of the guns he keeps in his bedroom, takes on a local gang of Asians with a much nastier tone than the ones in his immediate neighbourhood. He becomes a sort of white man protector figure, a chiselled, classical, superannuated hero who uses his old fashioned virtues to one last effect to save the new immigrant influx. The result is powerful, if a little simplistic, with bombast and symbolism overwhelming much subtlety.<br /><br />This film is noteworthy for being, supposedly, Eastwood's last screen role. And the finale perhaps gains a little resonance from that fact.</p></body></html>

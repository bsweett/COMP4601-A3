IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED LOIS AND CLARK!  2 1/2 STARS!"></head><body><p>I really wanted to love this movie, but it's really hard to point out it's good points. Clocking in at 2hrs and 40 minutes, you might think this was 'The Godfather'! This movie has two serious flaws....it's not much fun and it's very boring at times. They don't even have the excuse of getting the origin out of the way. This is supposed to be a sequel....right? Why do Lois and Clark look younger now than they did 20 years ago in the first two movies? I know it is only 5 years time in movieland, but they look like they are ten years younger not 5 years older. Jimmy Olson still looks like a high school kid though.<br /><br />Brandon Routh had some big shoes to fill and the truth is, the kid does a pretty good job imatating Reeves....maybe too good, it only made me miss him all the more. Kate Bosworth's Lois is flat and without the quirky charm of Margot Kidder. There are several silly action scenes too....Superman gets blasted with a gigantic gun that could blow holes in a battleship and when there is no effect on him, the thug pulls out a hand gun and shoots him with that too!(OK the bullit in the eye was pretty cool!) The action scenes are very well done, but the scenes with Superman and Lois floating around are not romantic, but yawn inducing! I also found it ridiculous that Lois's body would stay perfectly and effortlessly straight horizonally while flying with Superman, just by having his arm loosely around her waist.<br /><br />I know this is a comic book movie, but if you are trying to make the characters realistic, then I'm going to question these types of things. Some good news is the new Superman costume is cool. With some serious editing this could have been a great film as there are some good ideas in this uneven comic film. In the end, it just isn't very fun and it lacks the heart that Christopher Reeves brought to the role!(Shouldn't all superhero movies be fun???).....and I thought 'Batman Begins' was too serious!...Hoo Boy! ;-( ......at least that film had a brain!</p></body></html>

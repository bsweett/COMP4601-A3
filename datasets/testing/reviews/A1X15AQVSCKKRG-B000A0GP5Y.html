<meta name="summary" content="Another poor Hollywood remake."></head><body><p>Another poor Hollywood remake even Sadler fans will find few positives:<br /><br />This movie pretty much sucked starting from the idea that it could somehow be better than the 1974  cult classic.  This movie fails on so many levels it's not even funny. Even guys like Stone Cold Steve Austin or Kevin Nash  can't distort  the pathetic director, the overused  prison stereotypes that we've seen a million times, and UNLIKABLE character in the  lead (Sandler). Etc.<br /><br />Well let's start with the last part, Adam Sandler just sucks in the lead, Sandler himself is pretty hard to put up with so why put him in the lead?<br /><br />Other failures. The fact of the matter is that is a typical Sandler vehicle, his worse one yet , but if you have seen his other movies they're almost the same He makes an ass of himself gets away with it, then the movie ends. "Punch Drunk Love" was the exception.<br /><br />The plot is that Paul Crewe (Sandler) wrecks his car into another police car while the fact that his car was reported stolen by his girlfriend played in a small role by Courtney<br /><br />Cox. Then he gets of to prison which results in the usual prison offensive jokes we've seen a million times that gets old:<br /><br />"Someone will make his bitch"-Caretaker (Chris Rock).<br /><br />How enlightning, lol Tell us something we don't know. Eventually the Warden of the prison played a weak and flat James Cromwell who has an easy role recruits Paul to play against the guards in a football game.<br /><br />As someone else stated Sandler is totally unrealistic as a former football player, much less a quarterback. Didn't we actually see Sandler play a football/loser type of role<br /><br />already? Why yes we did it was called The WATERBOY!!!<br /><br />Why Peter Segal elected to choose Sandler is anyone's guess.  I guess he figured Sandler could carry this movie, he was wrong.<br /><br />I guess he figured Sandler could be funny enough in this movie to warrant a full viewing. He was wrong again. I guess he figured that fans would forget the great original that  inspired the remake and wouldn't notice the fact that  this movie is a pale and cheap imatation of it, he was wrong a third time.<br /><br />I did get a couple of good chuckles though (one or three at  the least) when Paul recruits his huge inmate playing Ping  Pong is actually well executed. However that's one of a  few good laughs I did get.<br /><br />Unlikable characters, prison stereotypes and familiar jokes,<br /><br />a dimwitted weak actor/comedian in the lead is all that<br /><br />told me this movie was a familar. Ebert and Roper were<br /><br />right on this one panning the movie.<br /><br />The original was funny but it was also raw, gritty,<br /><br />suspenseful and the keyword....it was original.<br /><br />Thus a remake was unwarranted and unneeded. I second then all the other critics and fans who say Hollywood should stop remaking these classics and leave well enough alone.<br /><br />Theyre not fooling anybody and in the process our respect for any filmmaker who participates in a remake is lost. Peter Segal has made some good funny movies: The Naked Gun the Final<br /><br />Insult, Anger Managment and Fifty First Dates were e<br /><br />ntertaing but this movie is not. This movie unlike the<br /><br />original does not stand for anything.<br /><br />It's just a predictable ride, boring and lame ride that doesn't deserve a second turn. It has no value or point to it.<br /><br />But then again Segal as most Hollywood directors , probably could not deny the huge money he was offered to do it as well as the unfunny and uninspiring Adam Sandler.</p></body></html>

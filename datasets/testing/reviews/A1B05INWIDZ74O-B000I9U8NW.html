<meta name="summary" content="Origins of the 4"></head><body><p>This is much better then the first Fantastic Four movie I saw. But it covers the same period of time.... their origin. In the movie, our four would be heros and Dr. Von Doom head into outer space to study a radiation storm and get caught it in. This storm affects them all at a DNA level and gives them each unique superpowers.<br /><br />The storyline is based on these five characters development and interactions as they transform into their new super selves. And learn to work as a team. Excluding Dr. Doom whose power is only rivaled by his ego. And the graphics for each characters superpower is well done.<br /><br />We do not get to see the great Fantastic Four Team up and fight until the end of the movie. Which may be a big disappointment to most. And may be why so many people gave this movie a low rating. But it does a great job on background and is fun to watch. I am sure we will see the action packed team fight in the second movie, which I know, will be coming out. If you are a Fantastic Four fan, I suggest watching this movie.</p></body></html>

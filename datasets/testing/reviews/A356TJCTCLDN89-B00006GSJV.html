<meta name="summary" content="a beautiful movie"></head><body><p>Russell Crowe is incredible as the West Virginia genius, John Nash. Jennifer Connerly, does a fine job as his wife, Alicia. The big shock of the film works;we find out that whole portions of John's day to day life exist only in his head and have for years. Looking at it later, you can see the very subtle hints that people and things are just fantasies. Nash's best friend only appears when he really needs him. Ed Harris appears, in highly stressful or emotional times, like his wedding day. This is a great film and only has a few tiny flaws. For example we never really understand why a girl like Alicia would fall in love with a man so different from her and her friends. Overall, I loved this film enough to buy it.</p></body></html>

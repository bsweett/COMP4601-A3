He's got all of the elements in place: a terrific cast, great black-and-white photography, great production values.  Like any great parodist realizes is that you have to have some kind of affection for the genre you're sending up and it's apparent that Brooks' loved those old 1930's monster movies.  The film is chock full of great set pieces and double entendres(when I first saw this as a child I didn't get most of them).  There is also a classic scene with Gene Hackman in an unbilled cameo.  The ensemble cast is one of the best ever assembled for a comedy.  Gene Wilder achieves just the right tone as Victor Frankenstein.  Teri Garr is voluptuous and funny as his assistant Inga.  Marty Feldman is loony as the hunchback Eye-gor.  Peter Boyle is monstrously funny as the Monster.  The rest of the cast(Cloris Leachman, Kenneth Mars, Madelyn Khan,etc.) are all given the opportunity to shine here.  If you want to demonstrate to a younger viewer that a film can be funny and a little naughty and not smutty then you can show them "Young Frankenstein".</p></body></html>

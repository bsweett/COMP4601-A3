<meta name="summary" content="A great christmas movie for older children"></head><body><p>If you are looking for a film that wold be good for children day older than 7 this would be a good christmas present. But younger children like 6 or under may be scared by this movie. The movie's characters break into songs about 5 minutes after finshing a song. Jack Skellington (voiced by Chris Sarandon and signing voice is done by Danny Elfman) is the town's head pumkin man, but is diappointed when he doesn't get a prize. So he leaves town, and goes to another town named Chirstmastown. Jack goes back to Halloweentown with the idea of Christmas. Home Alone and Home Alone 2: Lost in New York's Catherine O'Hara voices Sally a creation of an evil scientist (William Hickey). Okay where is Eastertown, Thanksgvingtown, April Fool's Day Town? Warning for parents this movie was rated PG for mild voilence.</p></body></html>

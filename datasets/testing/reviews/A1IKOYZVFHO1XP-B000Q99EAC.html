<meta name="summary" content="Rocky VI,chronologically"></head><body><p>Over three decades after the theatrical release of the original ROCKY in December 1976,the retired Rocky Balboa(Sylvester Stallone) steps into the ring one last time for old times' sake. He's probably fighting a new,much younger opponent. Instead of Rocky VI,this film was instead entitled ROCKY BALBOA. I'm sure there will be at least one more sequel. Rocky could train and manage a younger boxer. As all of Stallone's fans know,he no longer carries as much energy as he did three decades ago(Stallone is currently 60 years old). Since the original ROCKY,Stallone's fans loved him in other memorable favorites like OSCAR,TANGO & CASH,RHINESTONE,NIGHTHAWKS,OVER THE TOP,the RAMBO series,his several-second cameo in STAYING ALIVE which he directed(during the opening credits),and of course the five ROCKY sequels.</p></body></html>

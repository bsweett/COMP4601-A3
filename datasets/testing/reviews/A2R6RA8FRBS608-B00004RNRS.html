<meta name="summary" content="One of the greatest movies of all time!"></head><body><p>It's very hard to know where to begin when praising both this movie as well as the double "digi-pack" DVD of it. Julie Andrews gives a very strong performance as Maria, a misfit nun who is turned out into the world by the Reverand Mother to see if she really wants to be a nun. Her singing range of  4 octaves is beautifully displayed at the end of the song "Do-Re-Mi." Christopher Plummer is well cast as the Captain von Trapp who is not too likeable--yet is charmed into being a man again be Maria's infectious inner and outer beauty. The rest of the cast is well chosen and the viewer is treated to a rare screen performance by Marni Nixon; Marni dubbed vocals for Deborah Kerr in The King and I and she did dubbing for My Fair Lady and South Pacific as well. The second disc contains two fantastic documentaries about Salzburg, the city in Austria where many scenes were filmed, as well as the production and history of the film. The history of the real-life von Trapp family on whom the story is based is well laid out with revealing interviews from family members themselves. In addition, the cinematography is superlative. Very honestly, I cried at the end of the film and I NEVER cry--it's THAT touching! This is NOT a film to be sneered at as being sugary sweet. It's a classic tale of good triumphing over evil as the von Trapp family flees Austria to escape the Nazis.(...)</p></body></html>

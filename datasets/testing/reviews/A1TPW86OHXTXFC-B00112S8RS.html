To just stop writing right now and advise you to go out and see it as soon as you can. I so much want to avoid revealing plot points that I don't even want to risk my usual strategy of oblique hints. You deserve to walk into this one cold." Roger Ebert<br /><br />Sidney Lumet at the age of 83 has again directed a film for the ages. A film of a family falling down, round and apart. Philip Seymour Hoffman is amazing as the older brother in the family. He works for a successful real estate office in NYC. His younger bro, Ethan Hawke shows us how very great an actor he can be, and works for the same agency.  The Greek Tragedy begins when a plan to rob a suburban jewelry store goes all wrong.  The mom  and pop of this store are in reality Andy and Hank's parents.  Would you, could you rob your own family? You could if you needed money badly enough it seems.  Andy and Hank are in great need of money. Hoffman as Andy, has a habit that leads him to illegal drugs. Hank Hanson, Ethan Hawke, has a snarly ex-wife who wants her child support and cares naught how Hank gets the money. As Sir Francis Scott has said 'Oh what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive'.<br /><br />Albert Finney plays Andy and Hank's dad. His fine acting lends this film the reality of the quintessential dysfunctional family. His actions, so akin to a Greek Tragedy seal the fate of this film. The two sons who have always pandered for best loved son, can now give it up. The family relationships are not explained and it is up to us to get to know them. Mom, Rosemary Harris, has a small part but is the agent of change in this film. Marisa Tomei the wife of Andy and lover of Hank, ah, we are beginning to see the light here, plays the tragically ignored wife.<br /><br />"My grandfather, whose background was not so different from Mr. Lumet's, was dismissive of movies that seemed overly dark or despairing. "There wasn't a single decent human being in the whole movie," he used to complain. He might not have found any in "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead," but he would also have recognized the humanism that saves this harsh tale from nihilism. The screen may be full of losers, liars, killers and thieves, but behind the camera is a mensch." A O Scott<br /><br />Messy, emotional, melodramatic, film noir is my beat. This film has it all.<br /><br />Highly Recommended  prisrob 05-17-08<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014GI6I2">The Savages</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00002E224">Before Sunrise</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6303369030">Pope John Paul II</a></p></body></html>

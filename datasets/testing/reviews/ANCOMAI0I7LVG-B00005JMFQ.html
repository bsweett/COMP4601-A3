That is a good thing, for that means that there is more to love, and love I do, for `Love Actually' is kind of like the ultimate romantic comedy.  The film revolves around eight couples (not always in the most conventional sense) as they strive for love during the holiday season.<br /><br />To get into every aspect of this film individually would take too much time and space, plus it would take away from the whole surprise and joyous mystery of the film, but I will touch try and outline the plot a little.<br /><br />At the center of the film there is the young prime minister who has become smitten with his caterer.  His sister is having trouble in her marriage, for her husband has fallen prey to the young office temptress.  Her best friend Daniel is dealing with the death of his wife and raising her son (his stepson) Sam, not to mention finding some solace.  Then there is Jamie, who is going through a rough patch in his love life when he catches his girlfriend in the arms of another man.  Young lovers Juliet and Peter are trying to get their marriage off to a good start, and Sarah is trying to find love while juggling other responsibilities.  Add to this a washed up rockstar on the verge of a comeback and workmates (working in very compromising positions) and a young Brit who dreams of American girls and you have, in a nutshell, `Love Actually'.<br /><br />You'd think that this may be a little much, but it works, really, really well.  Each couple actually finds some sort of closure to their story, even if it's not the typical happy ending we are hoping for (I'm looking at you Sarah).<br /><br />What makes this film work so beautifully is above all else the script, penned by first time director Richard Curtis (who made a name for himself writing `Four Wedding's and a Funeral').  He wonderfully shifts the focus of the film from character to character without ever losing the audience or taking away from his characters.  Each group or couple or individual is given their opportunity to shine and engage us.  Sure, some couples are given more scenery to chew, but the audience will never feel jilted in any way.<br /><br />And then there are the brilliant comedic (and dramatic) performances by the entire cast.  Truly everyone is outstanding and to single anyone out in particular seems almost cruel, but there is no denying that Bill Nighy steals the show as Billy Mack, the washed up rocker who is battling the popular boy band for billboard sales.  His comedic timing is brilliant.  Other actors who shine are Colin Firth and Liam Neeson and Laura Linney who all capture the loneliness that comes from abandonment and or responsibility and they do so magically (especially Neeson and Linney).  Emma Thompson is marvelous as Karen, wife to Rickman's Harry; the husband with a wondering eye.  Hugh Grant is always superb, and Martine McCutcheon matches his humor beautifully.  I know I'm missing some, but I would be just foolish to miss Thomas Sangster who turns out a beautifully well rounded and sincere child performance that captures his youth and not a Hollywood fabrication of childlike maturity.<br /><br />As the films final frame comes into view the audience feels fulfilled, albeit a little stuffed, but it's a good kind of stuffed; like the feeling you get after holiday dinner.  There's a smile on your face, a little food on your chin and this overwhelmingly warm feeling in the pit of your stomach that lets you know everything is alright.</p></body></html>

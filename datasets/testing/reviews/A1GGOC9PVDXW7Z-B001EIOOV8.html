The longer they play, the more they lose, and in the end, we get it all.""></head><body><p>Director Martin Scorsese's CASINO is a superb crime drama that concerns successful football handicapper Ace Rothstein (DeNiro). Ace is put in charge of a Vegas gambling resort by the syndicate that owns it. He makes the mistake of marrying a hustler (Stone) and trusting her. To feed her drug habit she hustles him for a bundle of cash and jewelry, then splits. Ace's best friend (Pesci) is a psychotic mob leg-breaker who goes too far, too often.<br /><br />The film is adapted by Nicholas Pileggi from his own book. Pileggi also wrote the book and screenplay for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J09M">GOODFELLAS</a> (1990) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JGHL">CITY HALL</a> (1996).<br /><br />CASINO's main character is loosely based on Chicago-born sports handicapper Frank 'Lefty' Rosenthal, a frequenter of Miami racetracks. With Florida authorities breathing down his neck for bookmaking activities, Lefty relocated to Las Vegas in 1968. In '76, it was discovered that Rosenthal was running four Vegas casinos without a license. He was consequently denied one due to organized crime &aacute;ssociations. In Nov. '82, Lefty's drug-addicted ex-wife O.D.ed on booze, Valium and coke in a motel room. A month before this, he was almost killed in a car bombing.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(8.1) Casino (USA/France-1995) - Robert DeNiro/Sharon Stone/Joe Pesci/James Woods/Frank Vincent/Kevin Pollak/Don Rickles/Alan King/Dick Smothers/Steve Allen/Jayne Meadows/Frankie Avalon/Jerry Vale</p></body></html>

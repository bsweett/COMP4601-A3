<meta name="summary" content="Close Encounters with CLOSE ENCOUNTERS"></head><body><p>This is a great 2-disk set of one of my favorite Spielberg films.  Actually, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND is one of my all-time favorite films.<p>The &quot;extras&quot; disk features some cut scenes that I've never seen!  There is an excellent scene at the Neary's neighborhood barbeque where Roy (Richard Dreyfuss) must explain his half-suntanned face.  Teri Garr does a wonderful job.<p>Also, the documentary on this disk is incredible.  It is much more thorough (and seems to be a longer version) than the one that was included on the recent VHS release.<p>The film remains a classic.  Some of the night scenes (especially on the country road set) look like they didn't transfer well (i.e. grainy and faded blacks).  And I'm not a fan of the 1980's &quot;inside the mothership&quot; ending.  I'm glad it is gone on this version.</p></body></html>

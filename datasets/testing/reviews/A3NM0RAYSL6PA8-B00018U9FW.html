(Hey, at least they're praying, right?)<p>What works about this movie is Jack Black.  There is something demented about him that fits his lead role perfectly.  You get the sense that he's whacked in real life, and while he might not try to turn prep schoolers into rock stars, he just weird enough to make it possible.  But he is also part of what is wrong with the movie (a small part, but still ...).  There are moments where he just makes you want to cringe from all his weirdness, like when he sings a song he wrote to the class.  It goes on way too long and is, well, creepy.  Not good weird, but sad weird.  Because like his character in High Fidelity (a much better performance, I think, in a much better movie), Jack comes across like a guy who is, deep down, a sad, alienated loser; a guy who sits in a subway doing word search puzzles--maybe homeless, certainly dateless, and maybe a bit cranky.  And smart.<p>As for the rest of the film, the child actors are okay.  Nothing to write home about, but at least they're not cringeworthy.  The rest of the cast basically mails it in, but that's okay since Jack is a one man army.  So raise your goblet of rock and see this thing; you'll be mildly amused.  Which is more than okay.</p></body></html>

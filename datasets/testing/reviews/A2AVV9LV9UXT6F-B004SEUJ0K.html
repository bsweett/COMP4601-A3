<meta name="summary" content="Don't mind the bad reviews; it's a good movie."></head><body><p>Citizen Kane this is not, but it's still a very entertaining, action packed, thrill ride with great special effects, decent characters, and a pretty good story.  I notice that most of the negative reviews are from comics fans who can't stand how their favorite characters were treated in this movie.  Well, this is the movie, not the comic series.  And this manages to be a very entertaining film.  It has its flaws, such as Storm inexplicably losing the accent she had for the first two movies, and the occasional bit of cheesy dialogue, but it's good entertainment, and people who are not dead set on having the comic characters exactly represented on screen will not find much to complain about.</p></body></html>

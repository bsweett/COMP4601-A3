<meta name="summary" content="Predictable, Boring waste of time trash"></head><body><p>I have to say I like Adam Sandler in some of his movies (50 first dates and Wedding Singer) and then the bad ones ( Mr.Deeds,Spanglish and more). This film is a poor effort to get good jokes, big satrs in a bad movie. The jokes are all old and used already, the acting sucked Burt Reynolds has no life and shows off like he dose in all his moives, Chris Rock is anyoing like he is in all his movies and James Cromwell tries to be the meanest guy in the world and it's funny becouse he's not. The story is predictable and pointless. Overall it was a big waste of time watching the longest yard.</p></body></html>

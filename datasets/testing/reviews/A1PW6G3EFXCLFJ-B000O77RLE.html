<meta name="summary" content="A FAN LETTER TO AMERICAN BOYS"></head><body><p>This excellent film from director Clint Eastwood demonstrates again Mr Eastwood's brilliance as a film maker. My only small complaint is that the film seemed a bit too long. Even the subtitles didn't distract from the enjoyment of the story. Some commentators with a political agenda have pointed out a scene in LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA where Americans committed a war crime, as if director Eastwood was making a blanket statement against American troops. But not long before that scene, he shows the Japanese committing a war crime. If the use of flame throwers seems a bit extreme in an all-out war against a no-surrender enemy, think about the Bataan Death March. The movie also shows some Japanese officers as being cruel toward their own men, ready to execute them on the spot without a trial for minor offenses. This attitude toward human life is reflective of the general kind of Japanese leadership that led to massive atrocities in China and elsewhere during World War Two. To see the battle for Iwo Jimo from the persepective of the Japanese who fought there is probably quite a novel movie-going experience for most Americans. You see the American air force, fleet and soldiers as the detached, distant, near silent enemy from the point of view of the Japanese soldiers (roles very well-acted) and the Americans are quite ominous -- and deadly. If anything, LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA is a kind of reverse fan letter to the American boys who fought and died in the Pacific against a brutal and homicidally aggressive dictatorship that attempted to enslave millions of people.</p></body></html>

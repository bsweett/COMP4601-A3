<meta name="summary" content="4.5 Stars: Haunting, elegant, and wholly disturbing."></head><body><p>Oskar is a lonely, bullied 12-year-old boy, waif-thin, who lives with his single mother in a run-down apartment in 1982 Sweden.  One night while playing out in the snow, he encounters his new neighbor, Eli, a pale young girl who lives with a mysterious old man who goes out late at night.  The two kids become fast friends, but little does Oskar know that Eli has been twelve years old for quite some time now...<br /><br />"Let the Right One In" is a spectacular horror movie.  It's not your typical Hollywood fair; there's quite a bit of gore, yes, and it's definitely disgusting, but blood is never used gratuitously--it's all to enhance the atmosphere, which is what propels the film forward.  Granted, an emphasis upon atmosphere means a slower plot.  Viewers used to more standard horror movies will become bored; even hardened viewers of atmospheric films might shuffle in their seat on occasion.<br /><br />The wait is well-worth it, however.  "Let the Right One In" isn't scary so much as it is deeply disturbing; it's as much a psychological horror movie, which is usually the best kind of horror.  It seeps under your skin, letting the real horror of this budding friendship sneak up on you, until you suddenly realize: "Holy crap, he's best friends with a blood-thirsty creature!"  The center of the film is the friendship between the two children, a relationship that is as creepy as it is touching.  It won't be long until Hollywood gets its hands on this film and completely ruins it; thus, I highly recommend you see the movie as it is, and be prepared to spend a few hours afterwards wondering if you should be touched or terrified by this compelling, elegant, intelligent horror film.</p></body></html>

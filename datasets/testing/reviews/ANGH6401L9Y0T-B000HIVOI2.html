I will attempt to make something resembling sense out of this amazing plot line.<br /><br />In ancient times, something was buried in the sands of Egypt. In the 1920s, an archeologist (with his little daughter along for the adventure) uncovered a huge ring of metal unlike anything else known to man. So in the 1990s, Dr. Daniel Jackson (played by a very cute James Spader), was offered a super-secret job inside a decomissioned missile silo in the Colorado mountains. Actually inside the mountains, apparently. This huge ring has been set up there, and the project to figure out what it is and what it is used for is being headed up by the now elderly daughter of the archeologist that found it all those years ago.<br /><br />Actually, Dr. Jackson is needed as one of the rare few who might be able to decipher the symbols on the ring which are not Egyptian hieroglyphics. There are hieroglyphics on the stone which had covered the ring, and I think on the outer edge of the ring, but the ones on the ring itself are alien. Literally, as it turns out. Jackson is able to translate the hieroglyphics and recognize that what the thing is really is a star gate: a portal into somewhere else altogether.<br /><br />A robot probe is sent through and reports back that the conditions on the other side are fit for humans. A group of soldiers and Dr. Jackson are thus detailed to go through and find out what lies on the other side.<br /><br />What they find, predictably, is a civilization which resembles ancient Egypt in many ways, ruled by an alien who uses human bodies, the most recent one of which greatly resembles my former room-mate who is also a Multiply user. (But her voice was a great deal nicer and her temper was a little less caustic.) I'm pretty sure she has seen this movie and I wonder if she agrees about the resemblance.<br /><br />Anyway, there are many hazards to the soldiers being able to return to the earth, including problems on both sides. To detail them would ruin the story for you. But let me ask you this: what would you get if you crossed a camel with a bison?<br /><br />It's good fun, a rousing adventure, and I recommend it. The only reason it's 4 stars instead of 5 is that I kept looking for something rather more profound in the way of denouement. Still, real good fun.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Deja Vu Plot"></head><body><p>The story revolves around a Secret Service Agent, Pete Garrison  (played by Kirk Douglas) who is aging, but also having an affair with the President of the United States Wife, played by Kim Bassinger.  Twenty years ago he saved a president's life by jumping in front of a bullet.  In the opening scenes it is established he is a respected and has camaraderie with the Secret Service Presidential team.<br /><br />So after his friend, Merriweather is shot and killed at his house the secrets of all come forth in the plot.  The killing looks like a botched robbery, but it is soon established it was made to look that way.  David Breckinridge (another Secret Service Agent played by Kiefer Sutherland) is a great detective and investigator.<br /><br />All this unravels to be a secret plot by an "insider" to assassinate the president.  This astounding revelation stuns the team as it has never happened before.  Somehow they begin to suspect Garrison, who is being framed.  Garrison knows he is a weak link because he is hiding a monumental secret, an affair with the first lady.<br /><br />The film drags on the last half with gunfights and chases, and the plot seems familiar in many ways to Manchurian Candidate and other Presidential who-dun-its...</p></body></html>

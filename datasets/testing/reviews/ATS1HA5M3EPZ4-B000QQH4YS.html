<meta name="summary" content="Not much of a collection/20th Anniversary version is better"></head><body><p>I bought the Criterion Collection version of Robocop because I loved the movie and thought the expanded scenes might add something to the movie. I was wrong. I would give the movie itself five stars but the four stars goes to this Criterion Collection DVD. The sound and picture quality are very good but the supposedly added footage is all violence, and only a few frames of it at that. Not that I was looking for extended scenes of blood and gore but Paul Verhoven did such a great job of bringing out the human aspect of Robocop, that I thought there would be more scenes relating to his family or his relationship with his partner. Alas, I was disappointed. And the extra features are almost non-existent as well. I have the Criterion collection of Armageddon and it has two disks and over three hours of extra stuff. If you like this movie, you're better off just getting the standard version, the CC is not worth the extra money.<br /><br />Update: Feb 2008<br />This review refers to the 20th Anniversary collection;<br /><br />I'd Buy that for a dollar...<br /><br />That phrase is still used in some circles today.  Fans of Sci-Fi and comics would probably recognize it as the phrase in the fictional TV show within the movie.  What many people don't understand about Robocop is not only is it an emotional story about a man stripped of his humanity, but a story about the direction of American social culture as well.<br /><br />Released in 1987, Robocop is an ultra violent sci-fi story of Police Officer Murphy, who is converted into a Supercop after being killed in the line of duty.  Although he performs as he should at first, his nightmarish memories of his death at the hands of his killers come to the surface and he ventures out on his own to find out the answers to who he is and why he's having these memories.  After tracking his leads he falls into a trap by the corporate CEO of the company who owns him and is nearly killed.<br /><br />While this plot line unfolds we are treated to pieces of a world, which is supposed to be the near future, that is highly glutinous, greedy and full of crime.  Of course it takes place in Detroit, which at the time was the most violent city in America.  But now, you can look at it and see that the vision of the future was skewed, but not by much.  Silly sit-coms with mindless one liners are not our favorite form of Television entertainment...but are reality shows much better?  Big cars that get 8.3 miles to the gallon are making a comeback in this movie.  Even though we have them, they're not as big, as inefficient or as common.  It's also interesting to see the biggest TV is probably a 27 inch tube.  Everything is going flat screen now.  There are Television News flashes that show possible nuclear war breakout in Central/South America and Africa...not even a thought of that these days but back in the height of the cold war it could conceivably be only a few years away.<br /><br />My point is that this movie is smart and socially conscious...in a hit-you-over-the-head manner.  You watch the world of Robocop and wonder `my god, is that where we're heading?'.  Even though it seems we can assume we'll never be that disconnected it can definitely make you think, and be more aware of what the world is coming to.<br /><br />But putting the social statement of this movie aside to finish this review, it must be said that Robocop is an enjoyable movie, even today.  There was no attempt to display the technology to great excess, so in turn many of the scenes still hold up as a possible future.  Today a movie like this would be overrun with CG enhancements, many of which you wouldn't see.  Most of the special effects hold up very well, the ED-209 robot being the only exception.  The stop motion animation is probably some of the best ever put on film...but it still looks like a kids home made movie compared to the CGI affects of today.  They could invest some money and overlap a superior CG version over the old one but that would be an insult to the people who worked so hard on the Robot.  I'm sure those people look at it now and cringe.  However the matte paintings used are excellent.  Watching the special features on this 20th anniversary edition, you can really see how much effort is put in NOT in front of a computer.  The picture update is very good and both versions of the film (the theater release and the unrated version with about 2 minutes of extra violence).<br /><br />Peter Weller deserves a lot of praise for learning how to move like a robot.  He studied mime and made the movements very impressive.  The film makers believed you needed a good actor behind the mask for the initial involvement so you can care about this guy first.  As we find out he left a wife and son behind, we get even more involved.  All the other actors are top notch as well, especially Ronny Cox as the control freak CEO, Nancy Allen as his sympathetic but tough partner, and Kurtwood Smith, best known for his role as `Red' on That 70s Show (imagine Red with an ultra violent streak).  Although Director Paul Verhoven has done other movies, this one is most likely his best overall.  After this he moved on to Total Recall, Basic Instinct and then Starship Troopers, which also tried to make social statements similar to this.  But the balance of all elements belongs to the Robocop, giving us a good human story with action, brains and humor.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Boring, Extremely Unrealistic -"></head><body><p>The movie is a science-fiction plot centered on Army helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) who wakes up on a commuter train to Chicago after last aware of being in Afghanistan. His identity has changed to Sean Fentress, a school teacher. After a brief stop, the train explodes, killing everyone aboard. Stevens finds himself in an experimental device that allows users to undergo the last eight minutes of their lives within an alternative timeline, and requested to discover the location of the bomb on the train and identify who set it off. Supposedly this train blast is a precursor to a larger dirty nuclear device that will be detonated in downtown Chicago. It's just too complicated, too unrealistic, and too long.</p></body></html>

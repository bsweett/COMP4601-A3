The costumes and atmosphere were done really well. It really made me feel that this is what this dark and dirty place was really like. The difference between the haves and the have nots was very interesting. Of course the end leaves much speculation since Saucey Jack was never caught. But Depp was great. Great story and directing and kudos to Heather Grahams beauty.</p></body></html>

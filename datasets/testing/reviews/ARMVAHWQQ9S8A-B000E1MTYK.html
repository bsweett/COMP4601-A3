<meta name="summary" content="Avada Kedavra!"></head><body><p>It must be incredibly hard to condense an epic book the size of "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" into a movie less than three hours, especially with a legion of hundreds of thousand of wild fans ready to break into violence if their favorite subplots are omitted, so we have to give the screen writers for this film credit in that department, to start off with.<br /><br />As the films get increasingly darker and the content gets more and more adult, they seem to get BETTER as well.  I'll start off with the bad parts so I can get right down to the good: The explanation of "Prior Incantatem" in the end of the movie was lacking, and as it is key to how the main conflict was resolved in the film, it should have been delved into deeper, as should have Harry's relationship with Sirius Black.  While it seems things move a bit too fast at first, upon second and third viewings, all falls into place.  There is one major problem I have with the film, though:  Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore is so far off of the mark that I can scarcely believe that the director did not send him off the set in a dunce cap.  The real Dumbledore is composed, unlike Gambon's version.<br /><br />Onto the good: Snape (played by Alan Rickman) is great as always, though he doesn't get much screen time.  Rupert Grint (playing Harry's best friend Ron) shines as always, and while Emma Watson (Hermione) is still finding herself as an actress, she does well.  Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) was never better than he is in this movie, and the movie-goers will be able to laugh, cry, and scream with him.  The actors who play Cedric, Fleur, McGonagall, and Hagrid are all on point, but the shining actor of the movie is Ralph Finnes, who plays the most evil dark wizard of all time, Lord Voldemort.<br /><br />The graveyard scene with Voldemort is frightening, and by far the best scene ever filmed for the whole franchise.  It could have gone wrong in so many ways, but it is utterly perfect, and terrifyingly real.  The way Ralph Finnes moves so smoothly, then bursts into an explosive thrust, the way he whispers threats, and then barks orders... Frightening.  Beautiful.<br /><br />Other scenes that are well done include:  Brendan Gleeson (as Mad Eye Moody) demonstrating the Unforgivable Curses, especially when he introduced the Imperius Curse as humorous only to slowly bring the class to the severe reality of it:  The Yule Ball is beautifully angsty, and the scenery is breath-taking, as is that of the tasks of the Triwizard Tournament.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is by far the strongest of the four already released, and it has a very, very high replay value.  For your own sake, go out and get the DVD as soon as you can.<br /><br />9/10</p></body></html>

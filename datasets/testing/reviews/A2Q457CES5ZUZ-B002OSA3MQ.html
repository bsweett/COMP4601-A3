<meta name="summary" content="A Masterpiece of Suspense"></head><body><p>Anyone who has net yet seen this cinematic masterpiece is in for a rare treat.  &quot;The Third Man&quot; is both a brilliant achievement from the standpoint of superb black and white photography, with an Oscar being won in that category by cameraman Robert Krasker,and in dramatic storytelling with British fiction great Graham Greene delivering the premier screenplay of his notable career.<p>The film captures the dark and suspicious Vienna underworld by night during the black market and rationing period following World War Two.  American Holly Martens, played with an appropriate bumbling innocence by normally suave Joseph Cotten, leaves his middle class existence as a pulp fiction writer of westerns to fly to Vienna after an invitation from his longstanding friend, Harry Lime, played with a colorful ruthlessness by Orson Welles, to join him in a business enterprise.<p>The film's first shock occurs at the beginning of &quot;The Third Man,&quot; when Cotten is informed on arrival that Welles has been killed after being accidentally hit by a car.  Cotten is suspicious from the beginning.  His skepticism accelerates after talking to Welles' girlfriend, played with a sexy nonchalance by Alida Valli.  Eventually he learns that Welles is very much alive.  His anything but surefooted detective activities cause concern for British Army captain Trevor Howard, who fears that Cotten will be killed by Welles or another operative in his syndicate, which specializes in stealing penicillin, dilluting it, then selling it at enormous profits to hospitals.<p>&quot;The Third Man&quot; exudes effortless suspense from the opening scene up to the film's dramatic end.  British director Carol Reed was at the peak of his career when he did &quot;The Third Man.&quot;  Once your appetite has been sufficently enhanced by this film, make sure to also view two other Reed classics of the period, &quot;Odd Man Out&quot; and &quot;The Fallen Idol.&quot;<p>William Hare</p></body></html>

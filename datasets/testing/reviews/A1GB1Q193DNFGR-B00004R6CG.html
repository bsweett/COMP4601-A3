<meta name="summary" content="Hitchcock's Most Personal Film"></head><body><p>Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo is so complex in its intentions and so intricate and fascinating in its scope that it will take multiple viewings to uncover and comprehend the savagely beautifullandscape of Hithcock's  most  poetically vunernable and unberably passionate film. The damaged  heart of Scottie Ferguson portrayed so dramatically and effectvely by James  Stewart, in his most accomplished role, illustrates the damage caused by  romantic obession and the danger inherent in loving a fantasy. This  meticulously crafted Hitchcock masterwork is so unbeleiably vivid in its  emotions and true to its own creative genesis that it remains Hitchcock's  definitive work dealing with love, loss, romance, illusion, and romantic  obsession. A movie watchers must-see. The DVD edition is also quite a  package within itself as gives the viewer abundant Vertigo extras including  an alternate ending.</p></body></html>

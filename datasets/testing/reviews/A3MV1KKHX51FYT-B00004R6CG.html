<meta name="summary" content="The Strange Mrs. Allister"></head><body><p>The film begins with a woman's face - her eyes look bloodshot. Then the credits roll. There is a chase on the rooftops. One man slips and falls to his death. The other survives with a foot injury. [Does he look out his Rear Window?] Acrophobic? Can a cantilevered brassiere be revolutionary? John Ferguson is "available", like other Frisco bachelors. Is his problem curable? [Is there subtle humor here?] San Francisco is changing since the war. [Shipping was moving across the bay.] John is hired to follow another man's wife; there is fear from the dead. Reluctantly, Scotty accepts for an old friend. Scotty's Dodge follows the Jaguar. [The cars date the picture.] Isn't he following too closely?<br /><br />The Mission Dolores is an old historical church. "Carlotta Valdes 1831-1857". Next the Museum. Whose picture is on the wall? Then the McKittrick Hotel. "It does seem silly." Did she drop her tail? Scotty will consult a local expert at a book shop, and learns Frisco history. "Poor thing." Madeleine has jewelry owned by Carlotta Valdes, her great-grandmother. [Would a suicide be buried in a church cemetery?] Next to the Presidio, beneath the Golden Gate Bridge. Will Madeleine jump into the cold water? What next? Will Goldilocks sleep in Papa Bear's bed? "What happened?" [Note the coffee percolator.] Madeleine leaves, Scotty follows. [Does this film move slowly?] They go for a ride in the country and look at an old redwood tree. There is talk about not knowing the recent past. "How do you know?" Do the conversations make sense?<br /><br />Scotty's old girlfriend Midge is skilled at painting. But Johnny is not impressed. [What does that tell you?] Next they travel to a historic mission church. "There's an answer for everything." [But is it the correct answer?] They climb the stairs to the bell tower. Something falls past the window. There is a coroner's inquest: suicide from an unsound mind. [But now I got a hint to the ending.] "You and I both know who killed Madeleine." Scotty has dreams or nightmares. Does Mozart's music have healing qualities? Is Johnny sedated? After his release he revisits their former places. Does he recognize a woman on the street? Johnny follows her to a hotel. Judy Barton tells her story. She's not in Kansas anymore and has a driver's license to prove it. There is a flashback to what happened at that bell tower? Judy writes a letter and tells the truth. But she decides to stay and dine with Scotty. They visit the Exposition during the day. Scotty is controlling, he wants Judy to dress like Madeleine. Why is he doing this? [Does he have a clue?] Then he notices Judy is wearing that same necklace? Will Scotty break free of the past? What will Judy say or do? [Is there a pattern of deaths in the presence of Scotty?]<br /><br />The "Foreign Censorship Ending" is much better than the short ending since it wraps up the loose ends. Any investigation into Madeleine's recent past would have revealed the plot. The spouse or boyfriend is always the prime suspect in an unusual death; a person who profits from the death doubly so. Once you've seen this you will understand the rationale for the 1984 film "Body Double", a better film which echoes the ideas from this film. Contrast this plodding film to "North by Northwest".</p></body></html>

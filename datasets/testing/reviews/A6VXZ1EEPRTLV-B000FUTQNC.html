<meta name="summary" content="another Jack, on a desperate mission. . ."></head><body><p>An icon in the action/adventure genre, the characters Harrison Ford often plays are passive, quiet types, that explode into action only when provoked, and then follow through relentlessly until they overcome whatever obstacles there may be.  That broad description covers the basic storyline of Firewall (2006), where Ford plays Jack Stanfield, the head of security for a financial institution, who is forced to help a gang of criminals rob his firm, in order to save his family.<br /><br />A group of men led by Bill Cox (Paul Bettany) invade Stanfield's Seattle home, and take his wife Beth (Virginia Madsen), daughter Sarah (Carly Schroeder), and son Andy (Jimmy Bennett) hostage.  Forced to wear a camera and earpiece, Jack's movements are transmitted back to gang.  Cox appears at the bank impersonating an agent of a government agency, but there is a problem with his plan to access the funds, until Stanfield finds a way to make it happen.<br /><br />Mary Lynn Rajskub, probably best known for playing Chloe O'Brian on 24, is Stanfield's secretary Janet Stone.  Stanfield is forced by Cox to fire her, but when the chips are down, he turns to her for help.  There's a bit of the flavor of 24, as Janet provides vital aid to another `Jack'.  Veteran actors Robert Forrester, Robert Patrick, and Alan Arkin, are familiar faces in supporting roles.  Although attempts are made to illustrate his ruthless side, and Cox is quite nasty at times, he mostly attacks the weak and helpless.  The role of Stanfield is nothing new for Ford, and he carries it off fairly well, for a guy that was 64 at the time.  He may be pushing seventy, but Ford still has a passion for action films.  After completing Firewall, his next project would be Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008), a film that as a physical challenge, makes Firewall look like a jog in the park.<br /><br />Firewall is an unoriginal, mildly effective thriller.  The villains are amateurish, and not terribly bright.  You may not really believe that the Stanfield family could really be hurt, but there are some tense moments, before the action ramps up at the end.  As usual, Harrison Ford's performance, does keep things interesting.  The DVD has a couple of short bonus features which feature Ford, director Richard Loncraine, and writer Joe Forte.</p></body></html>

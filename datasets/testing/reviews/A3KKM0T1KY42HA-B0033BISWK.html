<meta name="summary" content="Ain't Gonna Play Sun City"></head><body><p>What happens when you take the concept of Apartheid in South Africa, but this time apply it to a stranded group, or should I say stranded colony, of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X768W">BrundleFly-looking</a> aliens? You get a cool rap song called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002Z7F">Sun City</a>! Oh wait, no no no. You get District 9.<br /><br />Little known Writer/Director Neill Blomkamp takes little known Actor Sharlto Copley, and with the help of very well known Producer Peter Jackson, makes a great sci fi movie. I was expecting that deliberate shaky camera work in District 9 (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018QCXGY">Cloverfield</a>) because I had heard that the movie is supposed to be mostly excerpts from a supposed documentary in the making. But that is not the case. Indeed the movie does start out as a kind of documentary. But the shaky camera is a welcome absence. The movie then quickly evolves into a well shot, well acted, thoroughly enjoyable action/sci fi film.<br /><br />Copley plays a bureaucrat tasked with relocating the colony of stranded aliens. This "colony", that's actually more like a slum, is discriminated against and the aliens don't get much better treatment than if they were in a concentration camp. So it is Wikus Van De Merwe (played excellently by Copley) who must politically persuade the aliens to "peacefully" agree to move to a new camping ground. Yeah...good luck. And suddenly when Wikus finds himself the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002KPI1O">Watermelon Man</a>, Wikus' world is turned upside down.<br /><br />Oddly, District 9 got slapped with an R rating by the MPAA. I didn't see much more than PG-13 violence and language in the flick, but my prawn-like skin may be a bit thicker than others.<br /><br />Verdict: Very cool movie.</p></body></html>

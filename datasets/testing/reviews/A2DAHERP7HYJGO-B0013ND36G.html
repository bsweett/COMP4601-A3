<meta name="summary" content="ARNOLD GETS BLOWED UP REAL GOOD"></head><body><p>It has been said that a second movie in a series is never as good as the first and that it usually ends up being the worst. In this series, that has proven to be the opposite of what has happened. While the first film was the most imaginative, the second used that as a jumping point and added some spectacular effects and action. This movie attempts to do the same and fails.<br /><br />For those who have been cave dwellers for a while, the terminator is a robot from the future sent back in time to kill John Connors, the man who will one day lead a rebel revolt against the machines of the future. So much for movie one.<br /><br />Movie two had a second more advanced robot come back to kill Connors but also a copy of the original robot come back programmed by Connors to save himself. Movie two.<br /><br />This time around, Connor's mother has passed away and he is on his own, trying to do his best not to get caught up in anything that might change the future and result in his having to be the savior of the world. Yeah, like that's gonna happen.<br /><br />A new terminator, the T-X (Kristanna Loken) is sent back in time by the robots of the future to destroy not only John Connors (this time portrayed by Nick Stahl) but those who will become his staff as well when the final battle comes. The T-X gets a good start on this killing off a few when she encounters John along with one time friend Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). With two for the price of one in her sights, she attacks.<br /><br />Too bad that Connors sent back another terminator to prevent this from happening. Yes, it's the old model played by Arnold Schwarzenegger that comes to help. But he is obviously no match for the updated model sent to kill and destroy.<br /><br />As Connors and Brewster get reacquainted with one another while on the run, the Hollywood stuntman's association garners a major paycheck as tons of automobiles are blown to bits and stunt men dresses as Arnold are slammed through various buildings. This movie is more about action and explosions than any real science fiction.<br /><br />No one wonders why it is that robots keep being sent back which means that the future never changed after all. If it had, why are they here now? And the reason they came about explained in the second film is given little validity if there is another way that the future could have yielded these monstrous machines.<br /><br />The acing is...well....who really knows since acting is not the reason to watch this movie. It does look well made, I'll give it credit for that. But it is one of the most hollow films I have seen I a long time. While I cared about Connors as well as his robot protector in the second film, I found myself not giving a hoot for anyone here. Rather than being thrilled and awed, I was bored.<br /><br />A sequel, to be a good one, should cover new ground and take us somewhere just a little bit different. This movie is a rehash of the last one without new dazzling effects or enough emotion to ring us in. It substitutes roaring explosions for the matters of the heart that made us enjoy the last film.<br /><br />One had to hope that with this film the franchise would die. But it didn't as the release of the new television series proved. Even the surprise ending was one that didn't really matter much by the time it was revealed. If you are a die hard fan, by all means watch. But make sure you watch the first two again and you will see where this one was lacking.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Different Type of Ghost Story. 57 out of 100"></head><body><p>Everything about Dark Water seems broken. The couple's marriage. The apartment. The people. The school. The janitor and owner. Everything about Dark water seems old, weary, confused and drab. Except, of course, for a very pink backpack found by a child on the rooftop of an apartment building. This one source of color and life in the movie points us to the one source of distress and death in the movie.<br /><br />Dark Water isn't a cliche ghost story, and for the most part that is good. The acting is wonderful, but the film still suffers from distracting flaws. Dark Water does drag occasionally, and often wavers between scary and suspenseful and just plain overdone. The major flaw with the film is that too much time is spent staring at the ceiling, literally. This tends to slow down the suspense at times.<br /><br />Another area where this film suffers, although to a smaller degree, is including scenes that have no business being in the film. Certain scenes do not advance the plot, and seem to be included for character development, or possibly to make us think that a certain character might be scheming against the protagonist. For example, there is a scene is which a lawyer talks on a cell phone to a woman, and then the scenes cuts to the back of the lawyer's car. From there, an African American male makes several comments that neither flesh out the lawyer's character nor have any bearing whatsoever on the film. We never see this "back seat man" again. Consider it 30 seconds of wasted time.<br /><br />I have never criticised a film for including useless scenes before, but felt it was needed for a review of Dark Water. There are more scenes than the one stated, including a scene in which the lawyer misleads the woman, and then enters a theatre alone. The scene is pointless and again, a waste of time.<br /><br />Other than this, I found the film to be entertaining, fresh and somewhat suspenseful. It really wasn't cliche or cheesy in the least. If you are looking for a fresh, well-acted ghost story without the modern trappings of gore or cheap frights, Dark Water is a good choice.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 57<br /><br />27 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />9 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?<br /><br />7 (out of 10). Immersion.

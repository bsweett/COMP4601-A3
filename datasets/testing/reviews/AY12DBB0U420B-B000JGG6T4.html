<meta name="summary" content="Makes Dirty Harry Seem Squeaky Clean."></head><body><p>My Bargain-rack movie for last night was "Man On Fire" starring Denzel Washington. I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. It was quite a good movie, but not for the squeamish. The movie came in two very different parts. The first part was a relatively quiet introduction in which a burned-out ex-CIA agent (Washington) was hired to be the bodyguard of a charming little girl (Dakota Fanning). The locale was Juarez, Mexico, and there had been problems with kidnappers. The first part introduced the family, Washington and his contacts, the city and the Mexican environment where all of this took place. This first part was rather charming and low keyed.<br /><br />The introduction ended abruptly with the kidnapping of the little girl under watch in a bloody gun fight in which Washington was badly wounded. A demand for a pile of money was made in exchange for the girl's safe return. Well, that was a major mistake on the part of the perpetrators. When Washington recovered from his gunshot wounds, he turned into one tough hombre who would make Clint Eastwood's "Dirty Harry" episodes look like a children's Sunday-school picnic. Ruthless? Oh, yeah. Police procedures were out the window. Washington tracked down the kidnappers one by one and their arrest, trial, sentencing and punishment were carried out right there on the spot. You may find it difficult to watch. In any case, almost everyone was corrupt in one way or another, even the little girl's father, but the sweet little girl was safely returned to her mother, sadder but wiser.<br /><br />The movie is well acted and directed. The action of the second half is brisk and very violent. There's no boredom with this story, trust me.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

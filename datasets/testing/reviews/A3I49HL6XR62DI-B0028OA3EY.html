I expected Brandon Routh and the rest of the cast to be doing imitations of their predecessors who starred in the 70's films. Not at all! Brandon plays a sensitive, strong and spiritual Superman who is quite distinctive from Reeve's boyish Man of Steel. Kate Bosworth holds her own against Margot Kidder's classic portrayal of Lois Lane. And, man what a Lex Luthor! Kevin Spacey is comic, but extremely cruel. He doesn't give one inch to Gene Hackman. The subplot about Lois' little boy is very well done. The classic musical themes from the 70's film will make you want to cry with nostalgia. Great special effects. One caveat: the film is over 2 1/2 hours long so watch it when you can devote sufficient time to it. One last word -- Marlon Brandon's Jor-el is seamlessly integrated into the film and it really works. Superman fans will love this film!</p></body></html>

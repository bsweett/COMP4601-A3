Yes, there's a twist at the very end, but you can kind of figure it out as the movie goes along.  There were some scenes from which I had to shield my eyes -- such as when the character played by Samuel Jackson falls down the stairs in pursuit of a villain.<br /><br />Samuel Jackson's character is very sympathetic. You feel his physical and emotional pain. Even at the end, despite who he turns out to be, you still feel sorry for him.  Bruce Willis' character is also very sympathetic -- an emotionally stunted firefighter, with a wife and child from whom he appears estranged.  The son gives a strong performance -- especially the scene where he figures out that his father is extraordinarily strong.<br /><br />By far the best movie directed by M. Night.  Too bad there were no sequels.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Journey to the Center of the Earth"></head><body><p>I am a very huge fan of the original "Journey of the Center of the Earth (1959)". In fact it is in my top five all time favorites so you can imagine from the ads I suspected this remake would be a real loser. Especially when I heard it was 3D. In all seriousness do you ever truly take the 3D movies serious? We did not watch it in 3D but I imagine we will at some point. After watching it with my wife we decided two things. We still like the original best, the second was this isn't a true remake. However, I mean that in the best terms. We actually found this version quite entertaining and not at all like the original and that we liked too. It doesn't try to be or beat the classic movie. Although you see some jewels, giant mushrooms, a dinosaur, et cetera, none of it feels or looks the same.<br /><br />Brendan Frasier (The Mummy), Josh Hutcherson (Jurassic Park III), and Anita Briem do a great job of acting in this movie and that really helps too. Look for a couple cute references in this movie to Josh's part in JP III. Good quality DVD with good replayability. I probably would have given it 3 and a half stars if I could but I don't feel bad about four. There aren't enough movies like this to suit me these days. As a kid I was spoiled by having lots of movies like this to watch. I kind of feel sorry for kids and families today because if they don't appreciate the classic versions, it's a wasteland out there for the most part. I recommend it for the whole family. If you enjoyed this catch "Stardust" and "The Forbidden Kingdom".<br /><br />CA Luster</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Rather Forgetful"></head><body><p>Final Destination2 starts with one of the best action scenes involving cars,trucks,logs of wood you will ever see. The first few scenes are pretty much the only good thing about the film. There on, it's a film you can skip for 10 minutes and rejoin because it's rather predictable. Besides being overdramatic in a wrong way, it seems like the ultimate film for movie watchers in their teens to go and watch at the theaters. It's not to be taken seriously as the music of the film would allow you to believe once you've seen it. I liked the scenes in which the Lotto Winner was killed mainly because I am a huge Incubus fan(they play "Vitamin" full length during it) Besides the above mentioned, the film is rather boring. It seems like that a video game with six characters all of whom are trying to save themselves from the unavoidable disaster in the form of death.<br /><br />Watch this movie if you're a curious fan like me. Noone would ever watch this movie for a second time so there is absolutely no sense in purchasing the DVD.I still can't beleive some of my friends found this film scary.It's more yawn inducing.<br /><br />Overall Grade: 4/10</p></body></html>

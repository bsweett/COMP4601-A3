You know, when aliens supposedly make a crash landing in a farmers barn in the middle of the night, and the farmer hears this and runs outside slowly with a shotgun ready to unload.  That sort of happens here, except, instead of an insane farmer, it's a little boy with an older brother and younger sister.<br /><br />I liked how the kids kept the alien hidden from their mother.  There were some close calls though, where the mother was only one step away from finding out about the alien, but for most of the movie, E.T. was kept hidden by the kids.<br /><br />The movie has good acting and really holds up well as far as family storylines go.  Also the film doesn't look old for 1982 either- the picture quality is surprisingly pretty good.<br /><br />One thing I think people forget to mention about E.T. is how well done the storyline is- it actually involves people feeling emotion towards aliens and open-minded about outerspace, and the alien slowly develops the same kind of feelings for humans.  Very nice touch.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Holiday"></head><body><p>My Oppinion: The Holiday is a very funny movie, i loved all the characters and the actors were great.<br /><br />About the film: The Holiday is about two women irs(Winslet) & Amanda(Diaz) who are fed up with thier love life. They switch homes for the holiday on a home swapping web site. Iris lives in london and Amanda lives in la. The two swap homes for the Holiday and end up meeting the guys of thier dreams which one Grham(Law) is iris's brother and Miles(Black) is Amanda's ex-boyfriends best friend. which takes a comical turn on how the girls keep the guys.<br /><br />My second Oppinion: The Holiday is a great Romantic comedy for everyone. Nancy Meyers does an outstanding job on this movie.<br /><br />If you liked this movie then check out The Holiday original Motion Picture Soundtrack.</p></body></html>

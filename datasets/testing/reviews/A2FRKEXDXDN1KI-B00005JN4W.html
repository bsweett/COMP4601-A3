<meta name="summary" content="Blu-ray: New special features, awesome PQ & AQ - MUST BUY for those who loves this film!"></head><body><p>In 2004, Pixar Animated Studios would go on to unfamiliar territory and that is creating a film not based on animals or insects but to create an animated film featuring humans.<br /><br />With the first five animated films from Pixar Animation Studios/Walt Disney having great financial success, needless to say, there was a lot of challenges and stress that the crew had to face this time around and to spearhead the project was Brad Bird, the writer and director who has worked on "The Simpsons" and "The Iron Giant" (and would go on to direct the Pixar animated film, "Ratatouille".<br /><br />Needless to say, "The Incredibles", which was budgeted at $92 million became a box office success, earning over $631 million worldwide, receiving nearly positive reviews from all critics and winning two Oscars for "Best Achievement in Sound Editing" and "Best Animated Feature Film of the Year".<br /><br />And now this successful animated film receives its HD treatment with a new Blu-ray release in April 2011 featuring new special features.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />"The Incredibles" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:39:1).  First, let me first say that even though this animated film was released back in 2004 and within the improvement of computer animation in the last six years, the film still manages to hold up very well!  In fact, this is probably the best video version to date as the Blu-ray really shows off the vibrant colors of the film.<br /><br />Hair strands are much more notable, but also the detail of the fabric of the clothing is also much more present and detailed that you can see the actual stitching.  Blacks are inky and deep and the special effects absolutely look awesome.  And while I didn't see any compression artifacts or any major defects on the picture quality, I did notice very little banding.  In one scene, where Mr. Incredible shows off his new red costume, you can see a little banding but really, this is the best I have seen of "The Incredibles" by far.  From the debris, to the presentation of the city and jungle landscape, this film looks awesome on Blu-ray!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />"The Incredibles" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English 2.0 DVS, French and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1.  And if there was one thing that really shined for this film on Blu-ray, it was the lossless soundtrack as not only was dialogue crisp but every sound and boom, you can feel it via LFE.  I love action films that know how to use the LFE and really make you fel it and in this case, "The Incredibles" delivers!  Also, the surround channels are well-utilized as you can hear various ambiance from surrounding objects to little rustling that can be heard as well.  Literally, the lossless soundtrack delivers in immersive sound that really gives you a feeling of the action that is taking place!  Awesome!<br /><br />After watching "The Incredibles" so many times on DVD, the soundtrack, while very good, never made me take notice as it did with it listening to it on Blu-ray.  Not only was this lossless soundtrack magnificent, it definitely make a big difference during my viewing and enhanced my love for the film.  Audiophiles will love the lossless soundtrack!<br /><br />As for subtitles, they are in English, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"The Incredibles" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />DISC 1<br /><br />  * Director's Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by producer John Walker and director Brad Bird.

Also, included is a digital copy of the feature film which works with iTunes and Windows Media Player.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Pixar is known for creating a good number of wonderful films but I have to admit that "The Incredibles" has continued to become one of my favorites and probably is the only Pixar animated film that I have watch possibly over a dozen times and have not gotten tired of it.<br /><br />I remember when I first watched the film, I was just amazed not just by the animation and design but also the storyline and the relationship between Bob and Helen and just grown-up things that happen in the film that probably would fly over the head of children but make the adults smile.<br /><br />And I'm sure that many people own this film on DVD, it's whether or not you want to upgrade to the Blu-ray version.  And the answer to that is YES!  You do want to upgrade as it is not only jsut a better video and audio transfer but you also have new special features featuring the crew of "The Incredibles" really giving us fantastic insight of what went on behind-the-scenes in the creation of this film.<br /><br />We hear about the challenges and the long hours it takes to create an animated film but in the case of "The Incredibles", I never knew that a higher-up at Disney opposed the film, I never knew about the intense feelings the crew had and how morale was low at one point because of communication issues.  There was a lot of things that happened during the making of this film and you start to realize how much of a challenge these individuals, these departments at Pixar had to face when creating this film.  Definitely it was not easy but at the end of the day, the entire crew delivered another Pixar hit!<br /><br />Not only was it well-received, not only did it make a lot of money but it was a film that managed to hook in both young and old.  And it's important to note that at the time when Pixar Animation Studios had films based on toys, insects, animals, etc., to have an all-human based storyline that was well-planned, well-written and well-executed made "The Incredibles" so entertaining and fun!<br /><br />Peter Travers of Rolling Stone Magazine wrote that "The Incredibles" was #6 on his list of the best films of the decade and to tell you the truth, when I think about films that I have watched more than 3-5 times in the last decade, there are not many.  "The Incredibles", I have probably watched about a dozen times or even more than that.  There are not many films that deal with many realistic issues that couples face and yet putting a superhero/sci-fi twist to it, "The Incredibles" is an exciting film that will continue to entertain generations to come.<br /><br />"The Incredibles: 4-Disc Combo Pack" is an excellent release.  A first Blu-ray disc with the movie and new special features, a second Blu-ray with new and all the classic DVD special features, a DVD and also a digital copy of the film.  This is truly a magnificent release from Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment and fans should be happy with this release, especially with how awesome this film looks on Blu-ray and its wonderful lossless soundtrack.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

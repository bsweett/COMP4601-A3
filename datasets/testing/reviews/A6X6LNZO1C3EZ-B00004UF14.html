<meta name="summary" content="definitely a top ten Sci-Fi classic movie"></head><body><p>Just over ten years ago I discovered what was to become one of my top ten favorite Sci-Fi movies of all time; Men In Black. Linda Florentino was hot in this, and I was amazed at how tough as nails Tommy Lee Jones could work so easily beside comedian Will Smith and both of them show how to get the job done when you're dealing with aliens from other planets. Tony Shalhoub (MONK) as Jack Jeebs is freeking hilarious and extremely well acted, Rip Torn is convincing as the agency top boss, and this may be the one and only time I will say David Cross did a great job in his role in this movie along with all of such a stellar cast throughout Men In Black. Frank the pug's, "If you don't like it you can kiss my hairy butt," is one of the most quoted lines from any movie for the last twenty-five years, and while I'm busy here telling you how much I like this movie, the sequel 'MIB II' is just as great. Get them both. If you like Sci-Fi at all, you'll love this movie.</p></body></html>

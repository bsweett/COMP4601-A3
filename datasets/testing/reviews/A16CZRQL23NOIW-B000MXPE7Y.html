It's about a devoted functionary of the CIA in those hard times from the first days of the WW2 until the not so well reminded and frustrated invasion of the marines in Cuba.<br /><br />The use of greyish lights (Please remember Sidney Lumet's The verdict)  is transcendental around practically every single frame of the movie, the faces are involved into a diffuse atmosphere, as the truth they keep is. On the other hand we will assist to the progressive and unstoppable crumbling of the marriage of this efficient agent, who sees what's going on around his personal life, and is incapable to make nothing to avoid it.<br /><br />William Hurt, Angelina Jolie, John Tuturro and Matt Damon are stunning every one of them, from their perspectives, make of this personal film of Robert de Niro appears as one of the most intriguing and devastating films in years around the times in which the C.I.A. was best known as the O.S.S.<br /><br />One of the top films of the year.</p></body></html>

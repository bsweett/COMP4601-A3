Romero's Dawn of the Dead is hella better than this, because it is a classic zombie movie that's a sequel to one of my favorite zombie movies; Night of the Living Dead. The remake doesn't seem like a sequel to the Night of the Living Dead remake, but a film on its own. I guess I'm old skool about my horror movies, but good horror movies are hard to find these days. If you love modern zombie flicks, you'll probably like DAWN OF THE DEAD!!!</p></body></html>

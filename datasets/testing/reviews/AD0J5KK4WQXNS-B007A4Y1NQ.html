<meta name="summary" content="Not enough cerebral activity to complement the madness."></head><body><p>Not good at all<p>I was expecting "Being John Malkovich" to be a sort of trippy ride like "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"  but I must say that I much prefer the later in terms of screen madness and insanity. BJM does stall a lot of the time and there are many dull moments in-between the bouts of lunacy. I certainly prefer the director's latest work "Adaptation" to this vehicle.<p>This film revolves around a puppeteer who manages to find a portal through a door in an office into John Malkovich's head. What a great premise! This boasts of originality through and through. Sounds just like what we need. I was really looking forward to this one. I like little cult items that do things differently.<p>However this is really a very mixed bag. You can tell that a lot of people in this movie are here to help out a friend. Some actors take their role a way more seriously than others. There is a lot of diversity in the quality there. I guess the reason why people went to see this film was to see Hollywood go wacky. It does just that, but is a tad bit embarrassingly executed as if you are watching the actors pour out their hearts on the Jerry Springer show. That is certainly not my kettle of fish. Maybe you will like this and I am sure that there are many people who simply adore this film but that was strike one for me. I do not like that sort of thing because it makes me feel uncomfortable to be honest and I found it hard to enjoy anything after that. I have read other reviewers here who did not like the film because of this either.<p>Strike two for me was the fact that the film's premise is limited to this "nutty" concept. It does not go outside of it much and when it does it can get extremely boring. The relationships in this movie are not fleshed out. When the divergence in acting quality meets up outside of its core theme the movie does falter into the realm of amateur film making. This can be forgiven for the director's newness but it is, frankly, boring.<p>The third Strike came in the form of a dud presentation. This is just NOT THAT WACKY. It does not get much crazy outside of the theme of going into Malkovich's head. A lot of it is simply executed in some way or another to look strange, but it just LOOKS strange and is not that cerebral at all. I expected this film to mess with your mind a bit more but it does not really do that. It just looks wacky but does not execute much intelligence along the way. Ultimately this is a bore.<p>However I will give it Charlie Sheen who saves this movie from one star purgatory. This vehicle is worth seeing for his performance alone. Overall this is "designer mainstream Hollywood wackiness" that can play to all audiences but is certainly devoid of making that extra leap of the consciousness that it pretends to expound on. This is no 2001 or Jacobs Ladder or Lost Highway. This is more akin to a dark version of a Police Squad movie. Not my idea of a wacky film, but a lot of people might like it and this review should not put you off trying it. I just did not like it at all and felt letdown by it all. It certainly does not live up to the hype for me for the reasons I have stated above. IMO, watch &quot;Adaptation&quot; instead.</p></body></html>

I loved the powerful soundtrack and beautiful visuals.<br /><br />Also as a work of art, "Hero" rises much above most visually impressive movies of this genre---the plot does require a fair amount of concentration and thought to really understand, and during the last 30 minutes or so a strong Buddhist subtext arises unexpectedly.  This was a pleasant and remarkable surprise.<br /><br />The subtext is Buddhist, but also very nationalistic and politically convenient from the Chinese perspective---I'm sure that the still-totalitarian Chinese government must've been very happy to see this one come out!<br /><br />The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is because I felt that many of the fight scenes were a bit overboard, and things got a little melodramatic towards the end between the main characters.<br /><br />But it was a very fun way to spend 2 hours!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A classic multi-faceted ghost story"></head><body><p>The Orphanage is a ghost story in the classic tradition [at various times whilst watching this I was reminded of some of my other favorite ghost stories such as The Changeling, The Others, and at one point, even Dark Water, the Japanese version]. It is high on atmosphere [the imposing gothic mansion in a remote location, sinister looking people, mysterious noises] and has a riveting plot.<br /><br />The story centers around Laura [Belen Rueda] who has moved into her childhood home, an orphanage, with her husband Carlos [Fernando Cayo] a doctor, and their 7 year old son Simon [Roger Princep] who like most children his age has an overactive imagination and an abundance of imaginary friends.<br /><br />They settle in nicely into the old mansion until one day when they go down to the beach to play - Simon lingers in a cave and when Laura comes to get him, he claims he was talking to a 'friend' and even leaves a trail of seashells so that his friend, Tomas can follow him back to the house. At first Laura dismisses Simon's ramblings as the figment of his imagination but soon comes to fear a more sinister  force at play as a game of  'find the treasure' seems much too elaborate to have been cooked up by Simon, revealing a secret that she wishes to keep from Simon.<br /><br />The story gets truly going when a party to welcome the newcomers [Laura and Carlos had decided to take in about 5-6 children into their home, all with some sort of disability] results in the tragic disappearance of Simon [who had opted to play with his imaginary friend than join in the festivities]. The rest of the story centers around Laura's desperate attempts to find her son, even resorting to hiring psychics [one played by Geraldine Chaplin in a very credibly portrayed role] whilst her husband plays the role of the skpetic, refusing to believe in any supernatural explanation for Simon's disappearance.<br /><br />There are some truly chilling moments in this movie - the sinister child with a sack over its face watching Laura in a darkened hallway, mysterious banging sounds that waken Laura at night,the psychic summoning and the discovery of some of the house's old secrets - all these add to the storyline and keep viewers engaged. Though the acting itself is not extraordinary, except perhaps for Belen Rueda's convincing mother in distress Laura, and Geraldine Chaplin's psychic, this is not an issue for the real pull of the movie lies in the subtle unfolding of the plot through a series of 'clues' that lead Laura to what she seeks.<br /><br />A highly recommended ghost story that doesn't rely on any gore, sex or unnecessary special effects, but allows the natural light and atmosphere coupled with some very effective old school effects to tell a classic ghost story.</p></body></html>

Directed by Christopher Nolan, and filled with his usual plethora of fine actors; the Prestige is a mysterious movie, primarily about the three stages of any magic trick, and the human condition at its finest and worst. It feels like this film is under a dream-like look, that reminds me of films that present a look of warm memories, but here I think it helps to expose a period of time that people did many great things.<br /><br />Obsession is a young man's game, says a tired Michael Caine, and it takes no prisoners I say. Most of the drama is portrayed between the bitter conflict between veteran magician Robert Angier played by the very talented Hugh Jackman and the two-sided, mysterious magician Alfred Borden played convincingly by Christian Bale.<br /><br />From beginning to end, The Prestige is magical. Such pain is exposed in the relationship between the lovers Sarah and Alfred. You are presented with nuances that give hidden clues that make rewatching it even more enjoyable. The haunting loss for Robert is played with emotion and lorn by Jackman, and I give him high praise. Robert becomes unnaturally obsessed after discovering that Alfred, the man that has made him so miserable, has found a happy life. But Alfred has more than just revenge in mind. It is not just a matter of tit-for-tate here. Robert's loss has ruined his life forever, and his poets heart has been savagely punctured. His true, masterpiece, is to see Alfred's newest magic trick stolen. The magic trick, to the dismay of Robert, is an incredible act. He is convinced, that it is more than some cheap doppleganger trick. But what is it? How is it done, and what is the prestige?<br /><br />The Prestige is an amazing work, done by a gifted director. The acting is a real high point, and the story and material, as presented, was absorbing to begin with and required no mercy from the viewer to take charm. I was not thrilled by the description, but from the first gorgeous scene, and the story beginning with the end, is very interesting and thrilling. I recommend this well made film.</p></body></html>

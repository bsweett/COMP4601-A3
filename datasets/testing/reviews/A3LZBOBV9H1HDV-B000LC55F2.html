This isn't better than "The Illusionist" (2006), but, however, it establishes its own pace and is different than "The Illusionist". The directing by Christopher Nolan (who is directing the upcoming Batman movie "The Dark Knight" (2008) and also wrote the story, Nolan also co-wrote the screenplay to "The Prestige" with his brother Jonathan, which is based on the novel by Christopher Priest. Nolan has also done "Batman Begins" (2005), which he co-wrote the screenplay and directed, which in fact is the prequel to "The Dark Knight", he has also done the American remake of "Insomnia" (2002), and the impressive psychological thriller "Memento" (2000), which he, again, also co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan and both were nominated for an Oscar for their screenplay and he also wrote and directed his debut film "Following" (1998) is excellent! Nolan is one of the best directors of our generation! The performances by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, & Michael Caine (both Bale and Caine worked with Nolan on "Batman Begins" and are currently working with him again on "The Dark Knight) are excellent! The music by David Julyan (who also did the music to Nolan's "Following", "Memento", & "Insomnia", he also did the music to "The Descent" (2006) is excellent! The cinematography by Wally Pfister (who also nominated for an Oscar for his work on Nolan's "Batman Begins", he also done Nolan's "Memento", "Insomnia" & the upcoming "The Dark Knight") is excellent! The film editing by Lee Smith (who was nominated for an Oscar for his work on "Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World" (2003), he has done Nolan's "Batman Begins" & the upcoming "The Dark Knight") is excellent! The casting by John Papsidera (who also done the casting to Nolan's "Memento" & "Batman Begins", he has also done the casting to "Final Destination 3" (2006) is excellent! The production design by Nathan Crowley (who also done the production design to Nolan's "Insomnia", "Batman Begins", & the upcoming "The Dark Knight", he has also done the production design to "The Lake House" (2006) is excellent! The art direction by Kevin Kavanaugh (who also did the art direction to "The Lake House") is excellent! The set decoration by Julie Ochipinti (who was also an assistant art director on Nolan's "Batman Begins") is excellent! The costume design by Joan Bergin is excellent! This is another one of Nolan's films that has put him in the place of master filmmakers. This is a visually, brilliant looking movie and it is also an impressive, smart, and excellent film that makes you think and keeps you guessing and makes you want more answers and questions. It is at times, confusing, but, it didn't affect me at all, because it is different than any movie out there right now, just like "The Illusionist" was before it or is, in some terms.</p></body></html>

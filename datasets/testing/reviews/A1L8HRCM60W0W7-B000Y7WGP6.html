<meta name="summary" content="HARD-BOILED HOLLYWOOD IS TWO MOVIES IN ONE; THE MESSAGE MAY FIZZLE BUT THE ACTION SIZZLES!"></head><body><p>Anyone who tells you this is "Syriana for Dummies" is clearly off his rocker. Both may be about BigSeriousThemes set in the middle east, but unlike its erudite counterpart, The Kingdom is two films in one: a straightforward FBI procedural, married to a pulse-pounding action thriller where the bad boys of terrorism are brought to book in a frantic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790729997">Mortal Kombat</a> style. The resulting mishmash may feel jarring to the vigilant but there's barely any time to mind it.<br /><br />We set off with a credit roll through Saudi Arabian history, a punchy distillation of a hundred and fifty years. Before we know it, rabid explosions rip and set the chilling tone, never to let up right to the final clip. In fact it's a good 15 minutes before we calm just enough to meet our principal characters. More as thumbnails than elaborate portraits.<br /><br />That's a happy band of FBI with Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Garner, and Jason Bateman. Heroes, they flout State Department orders and arrive in Saudi Arabia with a derring-do attitude, only to receive a cold welcome from their inexpert and ill-equipped Arabian friends. An altogether too many scenes are spent on personal bugbears, but see, the Americans just know better, even without their fancy forensic techniques.<br /><br />Countering this high nose, as best it can, is a captivating performance from Ashraf Barhoum as the Colonel charged with guarding, controlling and interpreting for these interlopers. Barhoum gradually forges something like a buddy-cop partnership with the main American agent. The film allows him some room, both as an individual and as a representative of his nation and the Arab world, to put across his point of view.<br /><br />Frankly, this tense cultivation of a quick bond between these two exemplars of their respective cultures is the most enjoyable part of the minimal talk in the film. You won't miss the standard-issue camp humor from Hollywood.<br /><br />And then comes the slick showdown. Blood bursting, gut wrenching action. Crowd pleasing, popcorn flinging mayhem. This bit is magnetic. There's a mildly mawkish moment when both sides leave a message about "killing them all", but whatever the critics say about the distraction of the hand-held "Collateral"-style camerawork or the ultimate vacuity of the drama, I thoroughly enjoyed the escapism. I forgot all the weak points and thumped right along.<br /><br />It's not a particularly memorable fare or anything--for meaningful documentation on the subject, consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/140013305X">The Looming Tower</a>--but it does its job and does it with throbbing conviction. Watch it life-size while it's still in theaters. Best popcorn money you'll spend this winter before the Christmas-y stuff shows up.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful Imagination in Wonderland"></head><body><p>Not your childhood Alice by any means. Tim Burton directed it, Johnny Depp plays the Mad Hatter, and the voice of the hookah-smoking caterpillar is Alan Rickman (aka Professor Snape). A lovely young Mia Wasikowska plays Alice as a 19-year-old who has followed a rabbit in a waistcoat down a rabbit hole to escape a put-up job of an engagement party to a total twirp of a young lord.<br /><br />This one answers a question I had as a child: why did Alice's clothes shrink and grow when she did? In this one, they do not. When she's tiny, and hiding in a tea pot so that the knave of hearts won't find her, Hatter fashions a little dress for her from the shreds of the dress (or maybe chemise?) she was wearing as of the earlier shrinking. Then when she's in the Red Queen's garden and grows very large, she is hiding behind some trees because she "outgrew" her clothes.<br /><br />The story is that this is (or is not?) the same Alice who was in Underland when she was a child, and called it Wonderland. This time her mission is to take up the Vorpel sword and slay the Jabberwock.<br /><br />The funniest character in the story is the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) who has an enormous head -- literally. Also an enormous ego. She has a sort of lisp, and sounds a lot like Madeline Kahn. In fact, I was surprised to find that the actress was one I had not heard of before; the sound of her voice was so familiar.<br /><br />Great fun, especially if you can put aside any expectation that it follows the original story.</p></body></html>

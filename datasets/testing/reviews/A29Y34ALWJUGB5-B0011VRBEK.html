I had heard that before, though, so I was skeptical when I bought it. I figured, yeah, the twist may not be as exciting or surprising as some say it will be, but I know that at least I'm getting a good movie. That was true for Oldboy--it is an excellent all-around movie--and the twist itself paid off big time. I've never been floored like that in my life.<br /><br />Oldboy follows the fifteen year journey of a man named Oh Dae-su who is married, has a child, and an obvious penchant for creating problems for those around him. He is suddenly taken from the streets of Seoul, and imprisoned inside a room for fifteen years, given food, TV, writing materials, a shower, everything a person can live off of, except simple freedom and the answers to his questions. During his time here, he trains himself to fight, records everything he did up to his current days of imprisonment, and attempts suicide twice, both failures. But then he's suddenly drugged and hypnotized, and wakes up outdoors, on the roof of a building, dressed in a nice suit with all of the few possessions he had had inside of the room. He soon learns that he's been framed for his wife's murder, and his daughter has been adopted by Swedes. And he has one thing on his mind: find out who imprisoned him and kill them.<br /><br />I won't go on from there, because I may spoil the twist for some people. I will say that the action scenes in this movie are great; it's as if the actors were placed in a room and told to fight for their lives. It looks real. The actor who plays Oh Dae-su plays this role brilliantly. He's funny and dramatic, and carries with him in his appearance all those years of imprisonment. The story itself plays out slowly, releasing tidbits of information, enough to keep you interested long until the next small lump of info. While not an actual mystery, you still feel as if you're trying to solve Oh Dae-su's problem along with him, as he makes it easy to get inside of his head.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie enough. I wonder why films like this get ignored so easily. Oldboy is smarter than anything Hollywood has made in ages, with superior acting, a great soundtrack, and an intense well-plotted story. If you like good movies, then pick up Oldboy.</p></body></html>

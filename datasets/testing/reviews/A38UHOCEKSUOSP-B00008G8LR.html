<meta name="summary" content="[4.5] The ultimate man movie"></head><body><p>It's one thing that you've got a film with a kick [...] cool as hell alien that hunts humans for sport, and there is nearly no stopping him.  But its the cast of this movie that really pushes the testosteroine into overdrive - with Arnold, Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura and a list of guys in their athletic prime, all sporting the commando look, armed to the teeth with what seems like unlimited firepower in the jungles of South America.  Even within the first 5 minutes of the film, you've got Arnold and Carl Weathers bulging their biceps while engaging in a very manly handshake - from there on you know this is gonna be one tough manly-muscled film.  And it is, until the Predator hunts them down one by one.<br /><br />In South America, the team is sent to infiltrate a small base and rescue hostages.  Finding their old buddies hanging upside down from a tree and completely skinned leaves the team ready to blow the living daylights off the enemy base, and they do in a spectacular barage of gunfire that can compete with most war movie scenes.  But they eventually learn that it was not men who slautered their old friends, but something else in the jungle, something that's not quite human.<br /><br />One by one, in scenes of suspense, chases, and more gunfire, the units die one by one, until it is just Arnold vs the Predator.  This is where the most excitment of the film lies, as Arnold must use smarts instead of muscle to outwit the Predator.  Yes, even Arnold can't beat him with muscle, as a one on one brawl vs the Predator proves wrong very quickly.<br /><br />In the end, Predator is a very entertaining 90 minutes spent.  You may not even realize there wasn't even a plot to this film, but it's one of those films that doesn't need one.  This is pure adrenaline action and suspense.<br /><br />Acting - 3<br />Action - 5<br />Characters - 5<br />Story - 3<br />Overall - 4.5</p></body></html>

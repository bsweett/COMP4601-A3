<meta name="summary" content="Great idea destroyed by the lamest screenplay"></head><body><p>Apart from the apparently unintended irony of a story about the evils of the beauty industry being played out by a digitally-enhanced Halle Berry and a post-operative plastic mannequin formerly known as Sharon Stone, there's something far more seriously wrong with "Catwoman": it's just terminally boring.  It's yet another of those "origins of the superhero" movies merely laying the groundwork for an abortive franchise.  There's nothing wrong with an "origins" story per se, and this one at least has the foresight to turn it into a murder mystery.  Problem is, it takes Patience Phillips (aka Catwoman) approximately 100 minutes to get to precisely the same place the audience is in after just 15: we already know who "killed" her and why.  Watching her slowly, painfully - even if gorgeously - discover what we've known all along isn't fun.  It's agonizing.  The saddest thing is, it doesn't need to be this way.  Tim Burton's "Batman" showed everyone - fifteen years ago! - how the superhero story can and should be told: just assume everyone already knows who the hero is and where s/he came from, and focus instead on creating a gripping adventure and a wonderful villain; flashback to the "origins" story if you like, but why make that the focus if it's going to be dull?  Basically, follow the principles of good storytelling: create a mystery, make us identify with the hero, give the audience reason to keep watching to the end.  Some of the best popcorn movies in recent memory follow precisely that pattern - "I, Robot", "Minority Report", and the "X-Men" series.  In "Catwoman", most of the effort (and budget) seems to have been spent on a handful of absurdly edited and utterly unconvincing fight sequences and some ludicrously elaborate fly-overs of the city skyline.  But no amount of digital trickery can compensate for what has got to be the lamest script this year.  It's about time the John Brancato / Michael Ferris writing duo were exposed for the talentless hacks they are.  "The Game" was their only decent offering, and even that had to be saved by David Fincher's direction.  "Catwoman 2"?  You're all dreaming.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Jaws(1975)"></head><body><p>Jaws(1975) is a classic Steven Spielberg movie based on the suspense novel by Peter Benchley. Sheriff Brody(Roy Scheider), shark hunter Quint(Robert Shaw), and marine biologist Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss) hunt a shark that's preying on people near Amity Island. Jaws was a critical and commercial success and it spawned three sequels. The filmmakers put most of the emphasis on the shark while the novel had many subplots. Hooper had an affair with Martin Brody's wife in the novel. In the Jaws movies, Ellen Brody is a more sympathetic character. The scene where "Chrissie" is killed by a shark while swimming was spoofed in Steven Spielberg's 1941(1979)! Jaws has been spoofed in movies and TV shows. There's a Jaws spoof in the 1976 Hong Kong comedy Mr. Funny Bone(Lo Fu Ji). A boy wears a Jaws T-shirt in Picardia Mexicana(1978). Jaws was ripped off in Great White(1981) and Shark Attack 3(2001). John Williams' music score for Jaws is a classic in itself. Jaws(1975) is a classic Hollywood movie.</p></body></html>

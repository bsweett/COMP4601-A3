<meta name="summary" content="Watching the movie through a different prism."></head><body><p>I believe the excellence of Waitress stands on its own, but my desire to like it was no doubt heightened by the post-production tragedy of the murder of writer/director Adrienne Shelly.  I think co-star Cheryl Hines says it best in the featurette: Shelly's tragic and senseless death compels you to watch the movie through a different prism.<br /><br />I was surprised that Keri Russell wasn't nominated for any best actress awards.  I thought she was outstanding.  She's in every scene.  Her performance carries the movie.  It's really a series of interactions between she and husband Earl (a wonderfully unlikable Jeremy Sisto), she and customer/owner Old Joe (a dyspeptic Andy Griffith) and she and physician/suitor Dr. Pomatter.  In particular, the relationship between Russell's Jenna and Nathan Fillion's Pomatter is very well-played, both by the actors themselves and from Shelly's strong writing and direction.  She will be missed.</p></body></html>

We can all relate to it somehow and Time Burton has given himself another hit movie.<p>Big Fish is the story of Edward Bloom's life. Young Bloom is played by Ewan McGreggor and old Bloom by Albert Finney. He is on his deathbed and his son Edward who is played by Billy Crudup has come to make his reconciliation with his dad. He's tired of his dad's stories and wants the truth from him. He feels like he doesn't know his dad, and he knows time is runnig out.<p>Ewan McGreggor is awesome. His fans will argue this as his best performance ever and I think it is. He is enchanting in the movie. He does a great job faking the accent and he just takes the role and runs with it. I wish he could get really get academy consideration for his role. It's really that great and an Oscar nomination should go his way. He's just as good as Depp in Pirates and Penn in Mystic River. This could be the best performance of his young carear. Ewan won't disappoint you.<p>I liked Billy Crudup in the movie. His character isn't a real lively one and has a lot of mixed emotions about his father. Crudup plays with the emotions well. He's a good actor and I hope to see more of his work in the future.<p>You also have to love Albert Finney in the movie. His character is loveable and he displays a spark that just makes you smile. He's a loveable old guy and his performacne will and can draw tears.<p>Tim Burton has just made a simply fantastic film. I really wish I could just shake his hand. He's a great director and has always made original and fun films. They've always been a little werid, but it's always made them special.<p>Big Fish is a great film. Take the family to see it. It's an enchanting and fun tale full of stories and memorable characters. Come see one of the most memorable characters you'll ever see a movie. Big Fish is just simply fantastic and is something everybody should see.</p></body></html>

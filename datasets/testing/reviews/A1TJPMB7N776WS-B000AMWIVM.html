<meta name="summary" content="QUICK! The Hack Saw, please!"></head><body><p>"Saw" is a pretty turgid affair despite the quick-cut, snappy title sequence a la David Fincher. The great title sequence of "Saw" is about the extent of the creative, adventurous juices on view in this film. And the actual director of this film, James Wan (what an appropriate name!) didn't have anything to do with the title sequence: a company that specializes in title sequences always does this.<br /><br />The plot as concocted by Wan and Leigh Whannel (who also plays Adam) is a cat and mouse contraption with so many inconsistencies that we soon lose interest in trying to figure it out. I mean: two men are chained to drain pipes in an abandoned sewage plant for reasons only their captor can fathom. To top that off there is a dead man on the floor surrounding by a huge pool of blood.<br /><br />The acting is grade school by Whannell (he had to have gotten this part by way of his deal with the studio) and Cary Elwes (remember when he was actually good?). And the big denouement is silly.<br /><br />I saw "Saw" and now I have indigestion.</p></body></html>

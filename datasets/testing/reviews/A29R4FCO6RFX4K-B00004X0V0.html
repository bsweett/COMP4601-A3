The premise, taken from the DC comics is simple, yet an excellent choice considering the talent behind the project and the possibility (now reality) of a new and exciting franchise.<br />With the superb comic duo of Smith and Jones (As agents K and J respectively) and an inventive take on Sci Fi cliches, added with well-played wit and charm, it's effortless coolness is just right. Jones' dry persona in the film, combined with Smith's jibes, is one of the best buddy parings since Newman and Redford. The supporting cast including Rip Torn as head honcho "Z" and Linda Florentino are great, and extra kudos for Vincet D'Onfrio as the bug in the "edgar suit".<br />Danny Elfman's Batman-esche score adds a nice layer of comic adventure. And extra kudos for FX maestro Rick Baker's award-winning alien creations. All of the seamless combinations of ILM and practical effects are literally out-of-this-world. The audacious concept that aliens are living among us (disguised as humans) provides for some humerous moments, including an alien observer screen that shows that MIB-producer Steven Spielberg and Sylvester Stallone (among others) are extra-terrestrials. Ok, so it's somewhat of a re-tread of GHOSTBUSTERS in some caveats, and it dosn't even pretend to have depth. But hey, the universal question pervades: Who cares? With comedy this good, it's minor flaws can be ignored. Building on it's endless comic potential to a satisfying showdown, MIB will no doubt linger long in anyone's memory, regardless of if you've been nuetralised.<p>But for cryin' out loud! Yet another re-re-release of the MEN IN BLACK DVD. However for all the jaded people who, knowledged by the usual re-release pattern so common in many DVDs (MATRIX, LORD OF THE RINGS et all) decided to wait for a better edition of MIB, then here's the best one to get. With enough extras to satisfy fans, this "Deluxe Edition" has it all. A 2 Disc set, the extras include a Commentary by director Barry Sonnenfeld, Rick Baker and the team at ILM, a featurette and trailer from Men In Black 2 a scene editing workshop, Creatures: Concept to Creation, Music video, Storyboard comparisons, Conceptual art gallery, Multi-angle scene deconstructions, Original featurette, Character animation studies, Extended and alternate scenes and trailers (Phew!). The picture and sound quality are top-notch too. Very impressive stuff, and one of the many reasons you junked your VHS collection yonks ago. And altogether, a 5-star DVD. But then, in a couple of months, a DVD 2 Pack of MIB and MIB 2 might pop up...</p></body></html>

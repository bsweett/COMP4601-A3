The movie lacks good direction, is full of cheesy goof ups and tries to rake in a lot of thunderous applause for it's action scenes but fails in doing so. The last half an hour was quite boring and the first forty five mins made me wish I had downloaded this film and given it a watch. That way I would've only cursed my download and not the money I had spent on watching this film.<br /><br />Superman makes me realise how I didnt miss much by missing out on films like Batman Begins. I've heard they were similar. Well, I'm twenty two and I like films with superheroes(or I can stand to watch them) but Superman Returns is a failure, a miserable failure.<br /><br />Three other reasons for my disliking of the film, a) Not enough scenes with Kevin Spacey, b) the child and the mother, none of whom can act; c) just how overdramatic it's limited storyline seems to be.<br /><br />You can hate me for saying this but this movie sucks. It's possibly the worst of it's kind. I'd much rather give animation movies like Cars a shot.<br /><br />p.s - there is not one scene in this film that will make you go "WHOA" [*sigh* what a let down]</p></body></html>

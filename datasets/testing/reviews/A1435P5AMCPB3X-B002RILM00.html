<meta name="summary" content="Obviously not the top of his class at the Police Academy"></head><body><p>Nicholas Cage plays a police officer who witnesses a disaster, and during his time of leave gets a letter from an old fiance who states her daughter is missing, some 8 or so years after they last spoke.  So he decides to take it upon himself to investigate.  Sounds interesting, but really really stupid.  He must have been the last one in his class from the academy to figure out that A.  It's his Kid B.  He should just leave (swim boat, whatever the heck you can do, just leave) C. He's the Pawn in a game.  The movie was predicatble, and a downright snorefest.  Save the cash, save the time, pass this one by on the shelf.</p></body></html>

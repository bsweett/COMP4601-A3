<meta name="summary" content="ALIEN AND PREDATOR THE BEST OF  FOES!!!"></head><body><p>i like alien and i like predator so i didn't know who to go for, but i wanted to the see the battle. the alien franchise is good, and the predator is in my collection as well. alien is a wonderful creature, ready to kill, and in this one it's no different. predator, a great hunter, and a force not to be reckoned with. the greatest out of space rivals ever to grace the screen, came together just right. i thought this movie stood up on it's own. greatly written out, nicely done, and the two main species were absoulutly wonderful. they did what they do best, kill and fight. the way they managed for this story to include both and end up having been enemies for ages, great job. the fighting sequence is great, the actors did their thing. it should have been longer, but with this new one coming out, maybe that'll satisfy my longing for more. thanks a bunch.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Double your hostage, double your action"></head><body><p>Another dark drama that makes no pretense<br /><br />Of having a plotline that makes any sense<br /><br />With two hostage stories, it's double the action<br /><br />Depending on violence to get your reaction<br /><br />Bruce Willis does "anguish", the thing he does best<br /><br />But the acting shouts "B" for most of the rest<br /><br />He once lost a hostage and retired from the fray<br /><br />Preferring to sit at his desk every day<br /><br />But as fate would have it, some punks cross his path<br /><br />And it blows up real quick when a cop feels their wrath<br /><br />They hold the Smiths hostage, the alarm system sucks<br /><br />The stakes get much higher when they find some big bucks<br /><br />And wouldn't you know it, the Dad is a crook<br /><br />By creative accounting, not quite by the book<br /><br />He's hidden some files under "Heaven Can Wait"<br /><br />And organized crime is now storming the gate<br /><br />The punks are in shambles, they're out of their league<br /><br />They're making mistakes out of greed and fatigue<br /><br />But Bruce has no choice, he can't put it aside<br /><br />His wife and his daughter are kidnapped and tied<br /><br />The ending's predictable, violent and gory<br /><br />A typical, everyday action-man story<br /><br />With fiery effects and slow motion also<br /><br />As a rental, this movie is packaged to go.<br /><br />(Rated 3.5 stars)<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 10, 2005</p></body></html>

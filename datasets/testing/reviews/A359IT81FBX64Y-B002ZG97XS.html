<meta name="summary" content="Derivative Dud"></head><body><p>I was in the mood for a few good laughs, and even though I don't put high expectations on whacky comedies, this one was a complete dud.<br /><br />Of course, the boys are always getting drunk and stoned, because that's how boys have fun. Of course, they all say "f" this and "f" that, because that's how boys talk. Of course, they all think that the good old college days were the best time of their lives, and of course a movie like this needs some kind of gimmick - in this case a hot tub - to take them back in time. I didn't mind the hot tub gimmick, but it's too bad that the entire movie was a gimmick.<br /><br />The story couldn't quite figure out if it was in the sixties or the eighties; there was a lot of "free love" going on, conveniently leaving out the pre-HIV herpes scare of the eighties. One of the guys sang a little hip-hop at a nightclub - so derivative of Back To The Future. Chevy Chase's role seemed to be as a useless kind of cameo: a time machine mechanic? John Cusack is nostalgic for a girl who stabbed him in the eye with a fork. We get to see Clark Duke's younger mom as a slut (mommy sluts are SO funny!). We get to see Craig Robinson cuss out his 9-year-old future slut of a wife. We get to see man-on-man action as a result of a lost bet - a sort of "gag" joke, so to speak. We get to see Rob Corddry upchuck on a squirrel.<br /><br />Okay, so there are a lot of lame and predictable jokes in the movie, but that's not the worst of it, because I actually did chuckle at a few of them. The worst of it was that all of the characters were crass, and the ending was predictably crass. It was a "happy ending" for all, but none of them deserved it. These losers "stole" the future from a lot of smart people, just for money and the "good life." They make Madoff look like a Boy Scout. This is the kind of go back in time story that I would expect an immature teenager to write.<br /><br />If you're nostalgic for funny nostalgia movies, I would suggest you forget this one and watch Austin Powers instead.</p></body></html>

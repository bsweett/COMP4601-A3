<meta name="summary" content="Ron Howard at his best"></head><body><p>Director Ron &quot;Opie&quot; Howard gets behind the camera and directs his best film ever....a dramatization of the near-fatal voyage of Apollo 13. Starring Tom Hanks &amp; Kevin Bacon. James Horner's music soars like a rocket throughout the movie...with vocal accompaniment by Annie Lennox. (The Eurythmics) A great movie to watch.</p></body></html>

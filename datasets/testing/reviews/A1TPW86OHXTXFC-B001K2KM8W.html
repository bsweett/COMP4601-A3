Kenneth Turan<br /><br />Guillermo Del Toro's , Pan's Labyrinth, is about young Ofelia, Ivana Baquero, who finds a gateway to a  world of gods and monsters, pain and pleasure. Ofelia  is her mother's best friend, and loves her very much.  Her mother has married a man who isn't just wicked, he is the personification of evil. He is  a Captain in Franco's army after the right-wing has seized Spain, The best fantasy takes place in a world between good and evil, desire and sacrifice, cruelty and mercy, freedom and slavery. This fantasy resembles the real world, and is an adult fantasy film. When Ofelia finds a  kingdom in the labyrinth  near her new home, it's a  place full of unreal creatures and a smiling-scary satyr , protrayed disarmingly by Doug Jones.  Ofelia's stepfather is dedicated to wiping out the republican holdouts and local partisans by any means necessary. The satyr explains to Ophelia that she is a lost princess, and she can return to where she belongs if she carries out the three tasks he gives her, without fail and without question.<br /><br />Ariadna Gil is Ofelia's pregnant mother  and Maribel Verd&uacute; , Mercedes is a woman on the side of the resistance, and are the two women in the film who bring love to life and who portray the loving side of life.<br /><br />The  fantasy sequences mix practical effects and computer animation have a terrible, beautiful quality to them. The scenes in the real world contrast the peace and beauty of nature with the brutality of war. Pan's Labyrinth is  bloody and disturbing, but adult fantasy fans will find it a glorious, gripping feast for the eyes.<br /><br />"Del Toro never coddles the audience. He means for us to leave Pan's Labyrinth shaken to our souls. He succeeds triumphantly. " Peter Travers<br /><br />This is a tale within a tale, a creation in which the actual and the symbolic are so intertwined that we are happy to rid ourselves of logic.  The movie's lingering seven-note musical theme by Javier Navarrete's is so haunting when hummed and that tune will not leave my mind.  The movie is a masterpiece, and I had to sit and ponder for awhile before I was brought back to reality. Well worth the Oscars and prizes it has won,  The addition of the second disc is enteratianing and informative. The use of fairy tale mythology in the film is well worth the view.<br /><br />Beautifully, marvelously,highly recommended for adults.  prisrob 5-17-07<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPA6">Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000274TLW">The Devil's Backbone (Special Edition)</a></p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Be One with John Murdock."></head><body><p>The perfect sc-fi thriller stats off with a look up at the stars. "At first, there were the strangers . . ." says the narrator of the begining. Slowly, but gently, we are taken into the world of John Murdock, a man who has woken up to find that he doesn't know who he is nor where he came from. Aside from that, he doesn't know why the whole city faints and sleeps at midnight. Plus, the sun doesn't seem to come up. Freaked out? So was he. This darkly telling of suspense and mystery has the perfect period piece; the 1950's. The entire plot concept is something described as explosively imaginative. But this movie, even though it broke even at the box office, is a rare gem of gems in the world of sci-fi. I've never seen a science fiction movie that incorporates Film Noir. It's pure genius. This movie deserves it's own genre. Call it dark revelation cinema. It's good. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

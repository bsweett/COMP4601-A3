The characters were not developed and the were quite flat.  The action starts very soon in the movie (the wave striking the ship) and thus there was no opportunity for them to develop.  The course of the movie did not allow for any significant development.<br /><br />Moreover, the special affects and all the action are not very well tied together or simply not believable. For example all the surviving passangers, including a young kid prove to be record swimmers that can hold their breath for a long period.<br /><br />It is a pity as if the script was a bit better and more developed the film could have been enjoyable.</p></body></html>

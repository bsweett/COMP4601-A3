<meta name="summary" content="The third movie is bad, but the so called box set is...."></head><body><p>EXPENSIVE! What is this, 60 bucks for 3 movies that you can buy for 10 dollars? I wouldn't waste your time on buying 3 seperate dvds for 60 bucks, just go buy them individually.<p>The movies themselves are...<br />Movie 1-Great, new fun and perfectly cast. Everyone loves the first Austin Powers.<br />Movie 2-The best of all 3. This movie introduces mini-me and is the funniest one of them all.<br />Movie 3-Terrible, it lost everything. The jokes are all repeats, and Byonce has absolutely no chemistry with Mike Myers. We see her talking to him then BAM they are partners and it is almost stupid that he has to find ANOTHER new girl.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sometimes senseless, but sensually splendid"></head><body><p>In this movie, Scott explores again the theme of creator versus creation. However, it is maddeningly incomplete - sometimes purposefully, I hope. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)<br /><br />A pale-skinned "god" sacrifices himself to seed a planet - ours? - with his DNA. Why is his dramatic death necessary? How about a blood extraction? It appears to be ritualistic and gratuitous. Perhaps it speaks to the theme of God's self-sacrifice in Christianity, and is meant to be a basis (racial memory, etc.) for such elements in religion.<br /><br />So, the team takes off in a Weyland ship to meet their makers. On the journey, we are entertained by watching David, the android, who passes time shooting hoops, watching movies, and eavesdropping on his co-passengers' dreams. Rapace's Shaw remembers her father, who passes on to her his reasons for belief - "choosing to believe" - which Shaw echoes.<br /><br />On the one hand, this sounds maddeningly unscientific, which is Scott's intent. However, as recent philosophers and historians of science have come to agree, Shaw's answer is actually the only basis for believing science can tell us anything - faith in a rational God who is consistent (due to his promises) is the underlying foundation of modern knowledge. As Nancey Pearcey summarizes for us in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0891077669">The Soul of Science: Christian Faith and Natural Philosophy (Turning Point Christian Worldview Series)</a> Rejection of this foundation has left the sciences (and even math) in deep confusion, although we see the external shell continuing to operate.<br /><br />Also, in our real world, many scientists or agnostics have embraced "faith" due to what they have discovered in science (e.g. Allen Sandage). But that's another story. I doubt that Scott, whose "1492" was filled with historical gaffes (no one during Columbus's time thought the world was flat), was even aware of these points.<br /><br />Things start to not make sense. Finding that the air is breathable, they remove their helmets. That's right. Who needs to worry about infectious agents in an alien world? Then two scientists, including the one who mapped the alien structure/ship they find, get lost. Later, one of them tries to pet a hitherto unknown alien life form, with bad results.<br /><br />Some of the crew are dismissive of David, almost rude and contemptuous. This behavior is hard to believe, unless we accept this as objective, scientific callousness (they know David has no feelings - or does he?), but is needed for a creepy plot point where, in conversation with David, one of them essentially approves his own demise. It's a very effective and squirmworthy scene.<br /><br />In another scene, the captain opens the door to an unexpected visitor. Right. Chaos ensues. In a way, it's all rather silly, if you think about it.<br /><br />There are questions. Is Vickers an android as well? Or is she Weyland's daughter? Weyland says David is the closest he'll have to a son, and Vickers looks pained. Some think this means she's really human (along with the fact that she has sex with humans). Yet later she slams super-strong David against a wall to get him to divulge something. Is this super-strength or is David merely humoring her? (The fact that she calls Weyland "Father" means nothing. Androids tend to become unpredictable in the movies, and David is no exception, either.)<br /><br />Also, why do the Engineers want to destroy us? Are we a threat? There is a phrase in the movie to the effect that "sometimes to create you first have to destroy." Likewise, Vickers is waiting for Weyland to die so she can take over ("A king dies ...") and David seems to want his creators dead ("Doesn't everyone ...?") Do the Engineers want to start over? Or is it just a necessary step in their whole scheme of things? Is something else going to take over from us?<br /><br />Or ... are we their creators? Wow.<br /><br />Why does the awakened Engineer go beserk? What did David say to him? A great scene underscoring the importance of android-thought-process monitoring, but somewhat abrupt.<br /><br />And why are there still other ships and Engineers on the planet, after 2,000 years? Are they on Union rules? (Note: this seems to be a different planet than the one in Aliens.)<br /><br />So many questions, hopefully to be answered in a sequel, where Scott can really jump the shark. A real fear, if you know what his "twist" in Blade Runner (regarding Tyrell) was supposed to be, thankfully averted.<br /><br />Note, though, the movie's tie-ins to "In the Mountains of Madness". I don't know how much Scott sticks to that plot, but it may explain most everything.<br /><br />The CGI is mostly great, except for the Engineer's death at the start (looks a little cartoonish). But otherwise the visuals are sci-fi wonderful. The monolithic spaceship hovering over the barren planet. The Prometheus, the Porsche to the Nostromo's Tonka. The Engineers. The Engineer seated in his slithering seat. The falling of the alien ship. (Too bad the cause was telegraphed in the trailers - I would have liked that to be a surprise.) The color palettes and production design demand to be seen over and over again. And I can't wait to see this on a 3D TV.<br /><br />The score evokes a theme or two from Blade Runner, appropriately.<br /><br />Ultimately, it's a little confused or confusing. The people don't behave logically, and some plot points don't make sense. But any fan of Blade Runner and sci fi will enjoy it nevertheless. Fassbender's David is spellbinding, and is reason alone to enjoy this movie.</p></body></html>

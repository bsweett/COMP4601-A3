<meta name="summary" content="A good movie"></head><body><p>I'm going to try to make this review short and sweet. I loved the movie. I don't want to release much of the story, because I don't want anydody that hasn't seen it, to miss out on it. <p>This was a well made movie. It had a lot of anticipation. The special affects are great, the action is great, the acting is great.<p>I'd have to say what I was really disappointed with in the movie was the T-X. They just didn't do enough with her. In Terminator and T2 the Terminator's have this swagger. You just never though they'd kill those suckers. When they did you almost had a sense of relief come over you. The TX never has that swagger. You don't ever really think she's gonna get them. Your more pre-occupated on wether they will stop Judgement Day from happening. <p>Thats my only knock on the movie. I did enjoy this movie a lot. Arnold once again shows that he's the greatest action hero of all time. If you liked the previous Terminator movies, you'll like this. If you like science fiction or action movies, you'll like Terminator 3. If you like arnold you'll definetly like it. It's just a good movie. Not much else I can say.</p></body></html>

But then again, these remakes will appeal to a whole generation, who haven't seen the originals. I'm not really a 70s horror movie fan to be honest. I saw Halloween and that put me off for life, I have never been so bored during a horror film as I was during that!<p>When I watch horror movies, I'm normally one of those people who jumps the height of themselves (which isn't very high for me), but thankfully, not someone who screams right the way through the movie. This was one horror movie that I didn't do that. Instead, I was sitting there, literally not believing what was happening on screen. Heaven forbid you take your eyes off the screen for a crucial second, cos otherwise, you'll miss something! <p>In some sense, the film is quite formulaic and predictable - it goes over the whole tried &amp; tested bit of separating up the characters before killing them. I'm starting to notice this more and more in films, and it's really beginning to get tedious.<p>Towards the end of the movie, Jessica Biel (Erin) seems to be competing in a wet T-shirt contest all by herself. Definitely aimed at the guys that whole bit, why else would it be in there?<p>This is a great horror flick, if you want a little gore, especially in a suicide scene - there is an absolutely terrific shot, but you'll feel physically sick when you realise what is happening. I can't comment on the original, having not seen it, but having heard some comments, I guess this is a lot better!</p></body></html>

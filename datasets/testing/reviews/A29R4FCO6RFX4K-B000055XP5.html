There are some terrific action scenes and great characters. Veterans Patrick Stewart (Charles Xavier) and Ian McKellen (Magneto) are terrific, as are Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and Tyler Mane as Sabertooth. The Special Effects in the film are inventive and amazing. My favourite SFX moment: Where Magneto is walking across a pathway created by moving metallic planks across a chasm, the pinnacle of cool. Director Brian Singer has loaded the film with eye-popping visuals and some great one-liners. Michael Kamen's futuristic score (one of his best) adds to the mysterious tone. After watching the film several times through, there are a few little quibbles. Wolverine is a great character, but a bit more exposition on the other characters would be good, and the rather stringent running time leaves the film a bit short on great set-pieces. Still, that's what sequels are for! <p>The DVD extras are great, with trailers, some interesting deleted scenes, "The Mutant Watch" featurette, a Bryan Singer interview, Hugh Jackman's screen test, still photo gallery and TV spots. To quote Darth Vader: "Impressive. Most impressive."</p></body></html>

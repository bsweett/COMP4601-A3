With only one year left in said decade, I feel safe in saying that. I also feel safe in saying that carved wooden puppets could have done a better acting job and a group of kids with handi-cams could have done a better job making sense out of this mess. Keanu Reeves plays the life or death deciding Klaatu with all the emotional oomph of Neo, Jennifer Connelly tries really hard to act disinterested and Jaden Smith takes the position of hyper-annoying kid.<br /><br />What you're left with is a visual feast that makes all the sense of the movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JYLT">Muppets from Space</a>. The Giant robot Gort somehow changes into man-eating bugs before Klaatu starts singing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SR2H">"Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft."</a> Well, not really, but at least it might have made this interesting. The plot is some muddle of a consortium of universal species needs to save the Earth from us piggish humans, and only Dr. Helen Benson (Connelly) can make Klaatu stop the destruction. But that pesky kid keeps meddling and might even bring on the destruction single handedly...or will his cuteness make the aliens swoon and the plague stop?<br /><br />The movie is as clunky as that plot description, wasting the talents of Kathy Bates as the creepy government emissary who spouts off dopey dialogue meant to be political allegory, and John Cleese, who should have skipped this movie and gone back to being "Q" in the hapless <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PPLIEG">Quantum of Solace</a>. There's an environmental message buried in the muck and cuteness, but it was a point better made in the highly original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FSL3E">Wall-E.</a> Watch that superior movie first.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="0.25 STARS: Another inferior remake with poor acting."></head><body><p>Perhaps one would not be so critical of the acting in the remake of "The Fog" if one has not seen the original "The Fog" directed by the great John Carpenter.  However, I have seen the original "The Fog" many times, and the remake fails miserably in comparison.  The story behind "The Fog" is unique and it takes a certain type of director and actors to pull it off, and John Carpenter and company were able to accomplish this fairly well.  However, the remake just fails to capture the atmosphere and charisma of the original.  I'm sorry, but you are not going to make an effective remake of a horror movie by replacing the actors in the original with actors like you have in this stinker of a remake.  It's just not going to happen.  The result is a movie for the teenagers and that's what this is, and a very poor one a that!  I don't like it!!<br /><br />Much like the remakes of the horror classics "When A Stranger Calls" and "The Omen", the acting in "The Fog" leaves a lot to be desired.  Hence the execution of the movie comes off laughable.  There is no doubt the acting and execution of this remake are both very poor.  The remake of "The Fog" is very difficult to get into because of this fact.  To be perfectly frank, the remake is dull, boring, and ultimately comes off like a total joke...at least that was my impression as I caught myself shaking my head in disgust repeatedly while watching this trash.<br /><br />If you're going to do a remake of a classic horror movie (not that the original "The Fog" is a classic by any means, but it's pretty good) or any good movie for that matter, you better have something more to offer than this garbage or it's going to fail and get hammered by the critics, and deservingly so.  An example of a great remake would be Martin Scorsese's classic remake of "Cape Fear" which has BRILLIANT acting and brings a character and flavor all its own to the table.  Alas, "The Fog" completely fails in this regard, not that Hollywood cares because the makers of this movie were quite obviously only interested in cashing in on the success of the original.<br /><br />My advice is to watch the original and skip the remake entirely because you won't be missin' a thing.  Fortunately, I saw this on encore and did not waste one penny buying or renting this garbage.  As eluded to above, it should be noted in any review of this movie that much like the remake of "When A Stranger Calls", the remake of "The Fog" is rated PG-13 and seems to be catering towards the teeny-bopper crowd and this conclusion is supported by the cast chosen for this movie and the undeniable teenaged or early 20-something theme throughout the movie.  In other words, it's got the teenaged feel to it.<br /><br />One quarter of a star for attempting to re-tell the story of the original...that's the only thing that kept this trash from garnering my dreaded 0 STARS grade.  Of course, a 0.25 STARS grade from me represents a terrible movie, but the sad thing is that I have seen much worse as impossible as that sounds.</p></body></html>

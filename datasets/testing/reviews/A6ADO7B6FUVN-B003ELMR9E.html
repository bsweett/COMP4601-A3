<meta name="summary" content="Worthy Remake"></head><body><p>The Los Angles detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and his partner are sent to Alaska to investigate a bizarre murder of a teenage girl.  During the murder investigation there is a simultaneous investigation of the two LA detectives in LA, which might incriminate detective Dormer and set free all the criminals that he has put behind bars.  When an opportunity to arrest the murderer of the teenage girl arises, the detectives set a trap for the murderer, but something goes wrong in the fog of things.  This leads to an overbearing sense of guilt for detective Dormer that induces insomnia, which affects logical reasoning and all other aspects of detective Dormer's investigation of the murder.  The constant daylight keeps the audience reminded with intelligent manner that one cannot escape guilt.  Insomnia is a remake of the Norwegian film with the same title where Stellan Skarsg?rd has the roll that Al Pacino performs in the remake.  The Norwegian version is different in the sense of solitude and culture while the remade version provides an clever and different view of the same film.  The film is cunningly directed as well as acted with a brilliant touch and it leaves the viewer with an experience that will not fade.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Mel and Gene meet Frankenstein"></head><body><p>Mel Brooks won the Oscar for his first film, The Producers.  He followed this up with two moderately successful films.  But in 1974 Mel became the top comedy directors of the time with Blazing Saddles and this film, Young Frankenstein.<br /><br />This is the ultimate sequel to the classic Frankenstein film (even better than Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein.)  Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) - pronounced Franc-en-steen not Frank-en-stine - is the grandson of the infamous Dr.  But he wants no association with the crackpot ancestor.<br /><br />But Frederick is beckoned to Transylvania for the reading of his great grandfather's will.  Frederick is met by Igor (Marty Feldman) whose grandfather worked for Frederick's grandfather.  On the trip back with Frederick's new assistant Inga (Teri Garr) they hear a howl (Inga: Werewolf! Igor: There wolf.)  They are met at the castle by Frau Blucker (Cloris Leachman) - whose name is accompanied by screaming horses.<br /><br />During the night Frederick is awakened by Inga who hears music from behind his bookcases.  This leads them to Victor's private library and Frederick becomes obsessed with his grandfather's diaries.<br /><br />Frederick has decided to recreate his grandfather's experiment and snatches the body of a recently hung murderer (Peter Boyle).  Igor is sent to the Brain Depository (after 5 p.m. slip brain through slot) to get the brain of a great scientist but he drops it and grabs the brain of Abby Normal - you figure it out.<br /><br />They are now ready to revive the monster!  But things don't happen as expected.  Well, they happen but not as soon as expected.  Frau Blucker (horse scream!) releases the sleeping giant and here it becomes a warped version of the traditional Frankenstein. But this time they capture the monster and try to rehabilitate him. This leads to a great musical number (Puttin' on the Ritz).  And this goes wrong, of course, and the townspeople chain the monster.<br /><br />As Frederick and Inga console each other, they really console each other.  What a perfect time for Frederick's fianc&eacute;, Elizabeth (Madeline Kahn), to arrive!  The monster escapes and returns to the castle and finds Elizabeth.  He falls in love with her and abducts her.  And in the most intense sex scene, they make mad passionate love (six or seven times).<br /><br />Frederick comes up with a final solution, to transfer some his knowledge to the monster.  But Inga wonders what the monster gave Frederick?!<br /><br />This is a non-stop laugh riot.  This is not the best comedy ever made but one of the wittiest.  Just when you expect a crude joke, the tables are turned.  This is a satire and next to farce, great satire is almost impossible to make and they did it!<br /><br />Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks made their film debuts in The Producers and respectively, received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination and Best Original Screenplay Oscar.  But neither had great success until they reteamed in this film.  This film would cement their status as comic geniuses.<br /><br />This would be Marty Feldman's greatest success as he would die a few years later.  Madeline Kahn would become a star for performance here and in Blazing Saddles.<br /><br />DVD EXTRA:<br /><br />Making FrankenSense of Young Frankenstein - A 36 minute documentary on the film, mostly featuring co-writer and star Gene Wilder who conceived the movie.<br /><br />Deleted Scenes - Seven deleted scenes.

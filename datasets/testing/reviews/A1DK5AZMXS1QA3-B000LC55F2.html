<meta name="summary" content="The most under-rated movie of 2006"></head><body><p>There were many surprises at this year's Academy Awards.  One of the biggest was the absence of nominations for several films, most noticeably this one.  Containing no sex, no nudity, no bad language, no gore, no grand action scenes, minimal comedy, a non-descript sountrack, and only several seconds of violence, this movie has none of the hallmarks of a top movie.  But a top movie it is; it sat atop the box office charts for a month and everyone who has seen it comes away impressed.  This is one of those movies that stands out for its inventiveness, its innovative mode of storytelling, its twists and turns at many points of the plot, and ability to make the viewer empathize with all the main characters.  Great movies have themes, and this movie has multiple.  First is obsession, not necessarily of revenge, but also of winning, of being the best, and of having what others have and more.  Second is rivalry.  Many movies have tried to show how a friendship evolves into a deadly rivalry.  Examples include Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, Gods and Generals and Cleopatra.  None of these does the job as good as this movie.  Neither character, Alfred or Angiers, is good, and neither are bad.  Both are professionals trying to reach the top of their professions, and if this means backstabbing each other, so be it.  Third is sacrifice; everyone sacrifices more than necessary to achieve their ends, and the result all around is lost loves and lost lives.<br /><br />The most impressive aspect of this movie is its mode of storytelling.  In the early 1990's, Pulp Fiction came out and introduced the circular method of showing a movie.  Then came the Sixth Sense in the late 1990's and the method of a flashback at the end that redefined the entire movie from the get-go.  Then there are the Star Wars movies; sequels first then the prequels later.  Now we have the Prestige; three different storylines spliced together to create a play on time.<br /><br />The movie was great, and the DVD was good.  No extra or deleted scenes, just the interviews, explanations of special effects, and poster art.  Overall, a great watching experience</p></body></html>

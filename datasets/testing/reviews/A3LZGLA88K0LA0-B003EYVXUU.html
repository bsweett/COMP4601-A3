<meta name="summary" content="LOVE HURTS"></head><body><p>LET ME IN is more accessible than its Swedish original. LET THE RIGHT ONE IN.  It's also more a love story than just a straight up horror movie, although the horror there.<br />Set in a hauntingly beautiful winter in New Mexico, the movie centers on a bullied 12 yr old boy who befriends his new 12 yr old neighbor, a strange 12 yr old girl who walks barefoot in the snow.<br />The cast is perfect:  Kodi Smit-McPhee, whose angelic facade hides inner anger and fury; Chloe Moretz, glowing in quiet despair; the excellent Richard Jenkins, burdened with guilt; and Elias Koteas as the persistent detective.<br />LET ME IN is a good vampire story, just a tad slow, but a smartly made movie.</p></body></html>

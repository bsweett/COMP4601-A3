The concept of a murdered woman who may not be dead after all certainly is compelling enough to serve as the basis for an intriguing film, but "Laura" just cannot make the most of its potential.<p>Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) is investigating the murder of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney), an up-and-comer in the advertising business. His two prime suspects are Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), a mentor to the deceased woman, and Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), a slimy opportunist who was wooing the victim. As McPherson gets deeper into his investigation, he starts to develop an obsession with the dead woman. He gazes at her portrait longingly and wonders to himself just what kind of woman she was. One night after searching her apartment, McPherson dozes off and is shocked by the identity of the person who eventually awakens him. <p>"Laura" is one of those frustrating films that should have been better than it was. The performances are all notable with Webb's being a particular standout. Tierney is beautiful as the victim of the story and it is easy to see why she would attract McPherson's attention even after her death. Yet, it becomes tiring to see McPherson bluffing his way out of situations over and over in an investigation where Lydecker actually does most of the investigating. Additionally, the sequence where McPherson finds the murder weapon is so clumsily shot that it drains all credibility from the film. In the end, the only certain thing that can be said about "Laura" is that among the better regarded film noir works from decades past, it is the one with the highest "camp" quotient and that isn't necessarily a good thing.</p></body></html>

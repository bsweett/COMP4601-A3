<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) Winner If Not a Knockout"></head><body><p>One of the pleasant surprises of 2006 is the "come back" of Sylvester Stallone, or Rocky Balboa, in his sixth and probably the final chapter that began back in 1976. The sixth "Rocky" film, or simply "Rocky Balboa," turned out much better than people had expected, if not as great as the first Oscar-winning one which is now part of American movie history.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa, now retired, and running a restraint, steps into the ring for the last time. It's an exhibition match against Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver), current heavy weight champion whose unpopularity is part of the reasons behind the match in Las Vegas. I am afraid the story is not as plausible as it should be, not because of the age of the star or Rocky himself, (who still looks in good shape), but because even the former champion like Rocky, I think, would have to fight his way more than the film describes, before the bout against the champion. The film's script is rushed at certain places like the relations between Rocky and his son, or the training scenes before the match.<br /><br />Still I liked "Rocky Balboa" for one reason. It is that Stallone, truly in character, delivers one of his best acting as Rocky, clearly aged, but still with dignity. The strength of the film is the character of Rocky himself, whose honesty and good-natured personality is exactly what makes this film special. There is no Adrian any more, but Stallone wisely brought back little girl Marie from the original, who is now living with her son. Geraldine Hughes is impressive as grown-up Marie, whose quiet interaction with Rocky reminds us of what he was like in the first Rocky film, where budding romance between him and Adrian played the major part of the story.<br /><br />The film is not flawless. The use of archive footages from the previous Rocky films is too much for me, and sometimes the film gets too sentimental. Still I think "Rocky Balboa" with moving moments and inspirational messages, is winner, if it is not a knockout.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An exciting tale of naval warfare"></head><body><p>&quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,&quot; directed by Peter Weir, tells the rousing story of HMS Surprise, an English warship sailing around South America during the Napoleonic era.  The ship's captain (played by Russell Crowe) engages in a battle of wits, wills, and firepower with a rival captain during the perilous sea trek.<p>This is a vivid, exciting tale of naval warfare, but it's also a satisfying and moving portrayal of a unique community: the company of a warship.  The film is full of stirring action scenes, but it is equally rich in the details of the men's everyday life: their food, shipboard entertainment, naval tradition, etc.  It's a sweaty, muscular portrait that really puts you in the midst of this fascinating world.<p>Weir gets superb performances from the large ensemble cast.  Crowe won my heart as the captain: he portrays a man who is tough and witty, but also humane and reasonable.  Paul Bettany plays the ship's surgeon, both a loyal friend and verbal sparring partner for the captain; it's a marvelously realized relationship.  The rest of the cast rises to the high mark set by these excellent performers; Max Pirkis in particular shines as a courageous young midshipman.<p>There are some intense scenes of violence and combat surgery.  But this material is not gratuitous, and is handled with care by Weir, who never loses sight of his characters' humanity.  And the film is also about much more than war; it's also about exploring a distant land and seeing wondrous sights.  There are nice moments of humor to balance out the film's serious themes of military discipline, ethics and tactics.  Overall, M&amp;C is a rousing adventure story, told with heart.  As a Navy veteran myself, I'd like to thank and commend all involved with this film.</p></body></html>

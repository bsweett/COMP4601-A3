<meta name="summary" content="Darabont/King collaboration hits a Speed Bump..."></head><body><p>I bought this film, sight unseen, because Frank Darabont has done flawless work with 2 other King adaptations (Shawshank & Green Mile). Aside from being a rip-off of John Carpenter's "The Fog", I expected a whole lot more. I simply didn't find any originality in the goings-on, with the exception of the excellent, ironic ending. After reading previous reviews, I must say I thought Andre Braugher played his annoying character fairly well, and the usually reliable Marcia Gay Harden was, indeed, over the top. (Piper Laurie might've done it better, since it's what she does well). Thomas Jane was fine, as was Laurie Holden; there are other King connections, too, with fine performances from Jeffrey deMunn (Green Mile) and Frances Sternhagen (Misery). The monsters weren't terribly original, and it just seemed like the film was lacking focus during the middle part. The ending, however, was so totally devastating that I'm glad I stuck it out. I await Mr. Darabont's next film, which I hope will be his redemption.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Mel Gibson's best film"></head><body><p>This movie has been heavily criticized by many (at least, where I live) but this is actually a great adventure film. The second half of the movie, as the hero is chased through the jungle by a group of Mayas, is terrific and breathtaking film-making, the best thing that Gibson has ever made. Of course, if cinematic violence is not your cup of tea, you might be better off skipping this film. Now, in terms of history, there are several inaccuracies that are obvious to even those of us not heavily versed on the Mayas. Though recent archaeological findings has made obvious in recent years that the Mayas practiced (as many societies throughout history) human sacrifices, the way they are portrayed here seem more related to the Aztecs. Another obvious mistake is having the Spaniards appear at the end: the Mayas had already left the cities by the time the Spanish arrived in the 16th century (for what reason, is the major mystery of the Mayas), and were living in rural villages.</p></body></html>

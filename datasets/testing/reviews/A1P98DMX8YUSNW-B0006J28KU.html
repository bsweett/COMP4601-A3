The Michael Mann script is brilliant, as is the photography and the classic Michael Mann/Miami Vice score. The action is as good as the "romantic" moments, and the classic Pacino/DeNiro moment in a coffee shop is unforgettable. Lots of bullets and gore, but forgivable this one time only. I laughed because the actor who plays the psycho killer in "Silence of the Lambs" plays a cop here. Val Kilmer is top notch, too.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Alice is the New Mad Max"></head><body><p>"Resident Evil: Extinction: is a good entry in the trilogy.  Milla Jovovitch returns as Alice (I still don't know her last name) who is riding on a motorcycle through the desert wasteland of Nevada like Mel Gibson in "Mad Max."  The world has been destroyed by the T-virus.  Now, she travels solo, attempting to help those in need as she searches for gasoline which is in very short supply.  Also, the T-virus has given her telekinetic powers.  She, like a caravan of survivors, are looking for a safe haven, as do many survivors of apoocalyptic, end-of-the world movies.  She encounters a group of hillibillies who have been capturing anyone who answers their distress calls and throwing them into an arena of mutant dobermans.  There is a great scene reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds."  Crows infected with the T-virus attack survivors of a convoy.  "Extinction" is much darker and more depressing than the first two.  There seems little hope for mankind's survival.  This time around, Alice battles zombies who have been genetically engineered to be much more agressive.  She also discovers another underground, hive-like laboratory owned by the Umbrella Corporation.  When she enters it, she encounters the most diabolical mutant of all.  Like its predecessors, "Extinction" has a "Twilight Zone" ending.  Hopefully, another sequel will follow.</p></body></html>

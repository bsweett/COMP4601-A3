I was, of course, referring to American Idol. For those who don't know this, in an interesting reversal of fortunes, Jennifer Hudson beat out former American Idol winner Fantasia for the role. And now, she's nominated for a Golden Globe, and has already snagged eleven awards (see imdb). Talk about life imitating art.<br /><br />Translating a Broadway smash to the screen is never easy, but this seemed seamless, and the other cast members, specifically Beyonce, Eddie Murphy, and Jamie Foxx, lent the film extraordinary believability.<br /><br />I generally don't enjoy musicals, but listening to Jennifer Hudson sing was absolutely a revelation.</p></body></html>

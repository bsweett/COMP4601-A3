<meta name="summary" content="An American Classic"></head><body><p>Certain films define not only their particular genre, but also their country. For me, as a Canadian, this film has always embodied the best and worst of what exemplifies southern American culture. It deals with children, with racial issues, with the persistent matter of &quot;differentness&quot; that lies at the heart of every person's most significant issues. To be &quot;different&quot; is to be isolated; it's an issue that embraces personality, ethnicity, skin color, economic level--everything, really. And this film deals with that matter on several levels. It is, to my mind Gregory Peck's more memorable performance, embodying as he does the ideals by which we can only try to live. And it was Robert Duvall's debut film performance as the spooky, seldom-seen, but everpresent Boo Radley. This is, in the truest sense, an American classic: affecting, powerful, and wonderfully faithful to the book.</p></body></html>

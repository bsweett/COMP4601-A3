<meta name="summary" content="Forrest Gump"></head><body><p>In my mind, I had the bare bones of a scathing review that would showcase my slyness and writing skill. I was ready to hate this movie. Dumb guy juxtapositioned into great moments in history? Life is like a box of chocolates? Tom Hanks? Much to hate. However, I enjoyed it. If you ever see a guy in a white suit waiting for a bus, don't sit with him or he'll tell you his life story. I jest. It's a fine movie.<br /><br />My dislike of Tom Hanks goes way back to a sitcom called BOSOM BUDDIES, built on the unbelievable premise that the only way these two guys could find an apartment was to dress as women. What I noticed, week after week, was that Tom Hanks' lack of talent dragged down Peter Scolari. I've also seen Hanks in SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, THE GREEN MILE and APOLLO 13, and he did nothing in any of them to raise my opinion of him.<br /><br />(APOLLO 13 works because a skilled ensemble cast and a wooden "hero" to lead them can be a highly effective device. Schwarzeneggar built a career on this, and I don't fault him for it.)<br /><br />But I can't conceive of anyone except Hanks as Forrest, Forrest Gump. He was excellent. I'm also proud that I immediately recognized the young actor from THE SIXTH SENSE when he was but a brief flash of hair. He has a presence that we'll enjoy for many years.<br /><br />The marketing department dropped the ball on this movie. They made it sound like I'd learn some deep life lessons from a guy with half my IQ. An offensive premise, and I don't even believe in IQ tests. It's not like that at all. It's such an unusual juxtaposition (there's that word again) that nobody knew how to pitch it accurately. Sometimes it's like that. We're authors. We know this better than anyone. I may hunt down the book.</p></body></html>

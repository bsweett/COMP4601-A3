<meta name="summary" content="The Funniest Star Trek Film Ever"></head><body><p>Without question, this has to rank alongside &quot;The Trouble With Tribbles&quot; as a classic example of &quot;Star Trek&quot; humor featuring the original series cast. I'd dare say it's even funnier. I never thought either William Shatner or Leonard Nimoy would be brilliant comedians, yet their humorous portrayals of Kirk and Spock are quite convincing. You'll burst out laughing hearing Kirk's and Spock's reaction to contemporary coarse American language (And there is a scene involving Spock on a San Francisco bus that is absolutely priceless.). The supporting cast, including Original Series regulars DeForest Kelley, Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei and James Doohan make much of their relatively brief time on the screen. Catherine Hicks is credible as the 20th Century cetacean biologist romanced by Admiral James T. Kirk. I credit the film's writers, including Nicholas Meyer, for allowing the original cast to boldly go where they rarely went before, with respect to humor. It's certainly among my favorite films in the ongoing &quot;Star Trek&quot; series.</p></body></html>

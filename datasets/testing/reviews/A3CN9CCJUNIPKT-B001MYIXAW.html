<meta name="summary" content="Sometimes getting through the pre-teen years seems like an eternity..."></head><body><p>"Let The Right One In"<br />(Magnolia Home Entertainment, 2009)<br />-------------------------------------------------<br />NOTE: Spoilers below.<br />-------------------------------------------------<br />In this slow, sad Swedish vampire film, a gloomy young boy named Oskar falls under the spell of a magnetic child-sized vampire named Eli... Eli moves in next door to Oskar in a large, dull, modern apartment complex where Oskar often flees to escape the cruel attentions of several sadistic school bullies. Eli sees his dilemma, and encourages Oskar to fight back, even though he is too puny to defend himself without resorting to violent, Columbine-like tactics. As Eli's vampirism slowly becomes apparent, both to Oskar and to the angry locals, the two twelve-year-olds -- one eternal, the other mortal -- grow closer and more co-dependent. Although the film is notably low-budget (and poorly dubbed, in the American re-release) it succeeds on a deeper psychological level, as viewers are constantly made to doubt Eli's altruism towards the hapless, vulnerable Oskar. Their puppy-love relationship is complicated by the revelation that Eli (pronounced like Ellie, the girl's name) was once male, a twist that is sure to be left out of the currently-scheduled American remake... Although this film is low-rent and a bit awkward, it packs a potent psychic wallop: fans of Anne Rice's "Interview With A Vampire" (the book, not the film) will love this as well.

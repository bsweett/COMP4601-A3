That is with the exception of his '72 Gran Torino. When he finds himself pulled into a gang related situation terrorizing his Asian neighbors he finds himself invested and connected to others for the first time since the death of his wife and reevaluates his life and what he should do to better things for the neighborhood.<br /><br />Critique: 'Gran Torino' is a hard hitting contemporary drama that mirrors many of the attitudes and social problems plaquing American urban society; loneliness, ignorance, racism, uninvolvement, hostility and gang violence to name a few. Clint Eastwood delivers one of his best film performances (my personal favorite is 'Pale Rider'). The dialogue is sharp and bitting, the storyline edgy and contemporary and the acting is honest and believable. This is hard-hitting cinema that is both enjoyable and meaningful. Recommended viewing.</p></body></html>

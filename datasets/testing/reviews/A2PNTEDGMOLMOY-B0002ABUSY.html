Perhaps because I didn't have to carry the obligatory baggage of the cult classic with me while I watched this movie, I really enjoyed this "Dawn of the Dead" as a chilling, scary flick that stayed with me well after the final credits roll.<br /><br />The story of "Dead" is about as simple as it gets.  For an unknown reason (while the DVD jacket refers to a "virus," the movie never explains it), corpses are re-animating as zombies . . . with appetites.  How this all gets started is unclear, since it appears that one becomes a zombie by being bitten by a zombie, raising an interesting "chicken or the egg" logical problem.  But you don't watch movies like "Dead" to think deep thoughts -- you watch them to get the bejeezus scared out of you.<br /><br />And "Dead" delivers the goods!  The opening scene is a masterpiece of building tension.  Our heroine, Sarah Polley, a nurse, finishes a long shift at the hospital and obliviously misses several hints that something is going very, very wrong (including changing the radio station just as a critical "news flash" hits the airwaves).  She heads home, chats with a cute neighborhood tyke, and has a romantic night with her husband.  She wakes to find the tyke chewing on her husband's carotid artery, and soon she's fighitng off her husband, now a zombie.<br /><br />She escapes her husband, who gives up chasing her car to eat a neighbor who walked outside in her bathrobe, unaware that the world is coming to an end.<br /><br />Soon, she is in the mall with a gang of survivors, each with separate subplots and varying degrees of likeability.  The mall becomes the survivors' refuge against the rampaging hordes of zombies.  The movie skillfully balances the need for the survivors to occasionally run into zombies for the action scenes with the survivors' intelligence -- we don't have too many instances where we scream "What are you thinking?" to the characters as they wander off by themselves to their doom as in so many other horror movies.  The survivors' generally intelligent behavior highlights the scare-factor -- one is hard-pressed to find instances where we'd react much better than the survivors under the same circumstances.<br /><br />In an effort to avoid spoilers, let's just say that the gore-factor is high, but not overly so (well, once you're somewhat used to the fact that we're dealing with flesh-eating zombies).  There is a subplot involving a pregnant woman that is downright disturbing, but is well-acted and comes across as both terrifying and heart-breaking without being exploitative.  But director Zack Snyder is able to generate tension and scares by implication as well as by direct action, which is always good in a horror movie -- the terror that you imagine is usually scarier than what you actually see.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent horror movie.  Make sure you watch through the credits to see the "real ending!"</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Inaccurate & Poorly Researched"></head><body><p>Credibility:<br />The movie was in immediate "credibility" trouble when one of our stars is hanging onto a tree in the midst of a raging mountainous raging river of a tsunami and<br />(a.) as someone who has rafted the Snake River in Hell's Canyon I'll tell you right now that was not possible; she would have sucked in water and been dragged under.<br />(b.) while clinging to the tree she is hit by a car floating at a high rate down stream and ends up with a bruise -  should have been crushed.<br />(c.) the amount of time she's under with no control - she should have drowned.<br />(d.) but, somehow she's suddenly appears on a roof top being resuscitated.<br />I know, picky but that sets the tone for how the movie is being produced. One hour and fifteen minutes of  tedium as to knowing obviously where the movie is heading, i.e. that the three character subplots who are in three different countries will magically come together at the end and live happily ever after. End of story - except, of course, the hereafter.<br /><br />Incorrect portrayals:<br />(a.) Portraying science quotes:  "scientists minds are closed to such things as hereafter myths"; "evidence is irrefutable"; "others that disagree are enemies". First, scientists welcome all possibilities -  witness quantum, chaos, singularities and GUTs. Second, nothing is irrefutable in scientific process - everything is refutable. Third, disagreement is welcome. That is part of the process of how science advances. No one has an investment in being right, just in advancing the discussion.<br />(b.) The hereafter is shown as little statue people surrounded by a light is portrayed as real because "when unconscious no fresh images can be produced"; "there is no sense of time/space and you feel weightless". All are offered as proof of a hereafter. WRONG! Whether dead or unconscious the brain continues to function with cellular stores of oxygen and glucose for minute(s) and as they are depleted the normal white light effect becomes tunneled. Not surprisingly the one image you want to create when dying is someone important to you. The other evidences are normal for anyone who has ever had night time dreams.<br /><br />Producer bias:<br />It is not coincidental that Eastwood would make such a movie because there is nothing more desirable for a person approaching the end to not want it to end. Even more so if your life has been an accumulation of idolatry and materialism. The more you have the harder it is to lose it.  Preserving and passing on wealth to your descendants has been common fare for thousands of years - Egyptians!. It's just an additional pathway to immortality.  Sorry Clint - it just ends.</p></body></html>

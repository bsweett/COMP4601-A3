<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant Cast - and Wonderful Screenplay"></head><body><p>I love movies that can be both humorous and dramatic at the same time. And A Prairie Home Companion is such a great story.<br /><br />Garrison Keillor has a laid-back realistic style of humor that you usually don't see in movies today.<br /><br />Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin are great together. They play off one another as if they are really sisters. They come across<br /><br />as so natural. Lindsay Lohen plays Streep's daughter - she's a talented singer too, but very different.<br /><br />Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly steal the movie though with their hysterical characters, Dusty and Lefty. The lyrics of their<br /><br />songs are far to dirty and off-color for radio.<br /><br />Even though the script and directing are really great, because of the outstanding cast this really is an "Actors" movie.<br /><br />The actors in this movie are so brilliant, it is just amazing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""The Incredibles" is exactly that"></head><body><p>I don't have much to add to all these other rave reviews, so I'll only say this:  "The Incredibles" is a terrific movie that wonderfully pays tribute to the great Marvel comics of the 1960's (especially "Fantastic Four") and those early James Bond movies that featured flamboyant villains operating out of lavishly-appointed lairs.  The DVD adds many, many wonderful additions to the top-notch theater-going experience, including a short, deliberately cheesy Saturday-morning style cartoon featuring Mr. Incredible and pal Frozone, and a funny, amazing adventure (decidedly NOT cheesy) showing baby Jack-Jack dealing with his babysitter.  This really is a great DVD of a great movie.  Don't hesitate to purchase it.</p></body></html>

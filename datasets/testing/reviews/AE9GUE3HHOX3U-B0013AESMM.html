Jodie Foster did a great job playing her character, doesn't she always? But some of the other actors seemed like they were nervous, or just need more acting lessons.  It's hard to get into a movie when the actors don't seem like they know what they're doing.  There were too many improbablities in the plot, too many to name.  The dialogue was amatuer as well.  Like the whole "radiohead" thing they kept repeating, please give me a break. And the voice over narration by Jodie Foster sounded like bad poetry, that kind of poetry went out in the 80's.  It's like the script was written by a high school drop out.  I hope Jodie Foster picks better movies, someone give this girl a good script.</p></body></html>

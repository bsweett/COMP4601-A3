<meta name="summary" content="Jamie Foxx Tore the Plug out of the Screen"></head><body><p>Jamie Foxx tore it up on the Big screen. the acting is a 10. the film itself was spotty&Kinda long  in areas. the Book is a Must Read.  Regina King got snubbed by the Oscars as did Kerry washington. the Acting on here is top notch. the Bonus  material is tight especially with Ray Charles&Jamie Foxx during there Jam session. I'm so Proud of Brother Jamie Foxx. He is a Great Example of when you give a Black Man the chance to further enhance Himself His Craft you get huge rewards such as this film. I remember when Bil cosby&others Frowned on Brother Jamie Foxx after he did "Booty Call"&other so-so to forgetable roles&acted like that was all he could do,but  the Brother proved all Wrong in this Film. RIP Ray Charles. Jamie Foxx  knocked it out the Box from start to finish. I read on Ray Charles as a child&always thought the Music World of Him because as a Musician he was so Versatile. You name the Style&Brother Ray could do it. I still remember reading Billboard Magazine as a child&Being Blowned away that this soul Brother was on almost all of the Charts. he had no Limits to His Creativity. He was a Musical Gumbo without limits. this film deals with many aspects of His Career. Him Owning His Masters&controlling His Masters especially for a Black Artist in the 60's was as Ground Breaking as His Music was. ain't no doubt in my mind that unless the Oscars are fixed there is no way that Jamie Foxx doesn't win for Best Actor. he was the Entertainer of the Year for 2004 bar none. Props to Taylor Hackford for getting this long overdue film out here.the acting was Incredible all the way.all the Actors&Actress;s deserve a extra Bonus for this Film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good action movie"></head><body><p>Very intense and well written action/thriller movie, not to mention good acting (Danny Huston has become one of my new 'actors to watch for' after seeing his portrayal of the creepiest vampire I've ever seen in '30 Day's of Night' at the box office). In 'The Kingdom', a team of FBI agents must struggle to gain permission to investigate a tragic bombing at a base where many American oil workers lived in Saudi Arabia. The team faces an uphill battle, walking a tightrope between diverse politics and cultures. It's worth at least a couple viewings, and the final scene is a real 'nail biter'.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

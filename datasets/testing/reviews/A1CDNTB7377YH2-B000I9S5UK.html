<meta name="summary" content="A Surprisingly Good Action Film!"></head><body><p>Though this type of story has been done many times (corrupt cops have to silence those who know about them before they are exposed) this movie is very "watch able" and tense throughout.  This is probably due to the excellent acting of Ethan Hawke (as a cop that takes a desk job after making bad decisions that cost his partners their lives) and Larry Fishburne (as a mob boss that has the goods on the corrupt cops).<br /><br />Basically it is New Years eve and Fisburne and a few other bad guys (including a kind of annoying John Luzgamo), being transported to prison,  are brought to police precinct 13, which is due to be torn down.  The reason?  Because there is a huge snowstorm going on that is blocking the access roads and there is nowhere else to bring the prisoners in the storm.  Hawke is on duty with Drea Matteo and Brian Denahy (who is getting ready to retire from the force) in the building because it is the holiday and are not really equipped to take care of the prisoners they are asked to house in their holding cells.<br /><br />All is quiet until some attackers try to get into the holding cell apparently to get at Fishburne.  The police on duty are outmanned and way outgunned by the intruders and they have to figure out a way to hold them off since no help is on the way anytime soon (the bad guys have jammed any communications with the outside).<br /><br />The movie is fraught with tense moments and some good action.  There is a lot of great interactions between Fisburne and Hawke.  My only problem is that it seemed like the entire police force was in on the corruption which seemed a little implausible.</p></body></html>

(In fact, I remember back in the early 1990's when DVDs first started appearing in stores, and Forbidden Planet was one of the very first movies to go onto DVD.)<br /><br />I ordered this 50th anniversary edition as quickly as I could move my mouse and type, but it took me a few months to actually get around to watching it.<br /><br />I've seen this movie many times.  What I really was looking forward to was the bonus material that came with the movie.  All I can say is that the bonus features made it worth the price of purchasing the DVD set.<br /><br />First, the Additional Scenes are priceless.  I'd actually seen them before because I own the Criterion Collection laser disc (retailed for $100 ten years ago), but I don't have a laser disc player, so I finally got to see these scenes again on a media I can play whenever I want.  Cool!<br /><br />Second the "Lost Footage" is just about as priceless as the deleted scenes.  There's even an alternate introductory narrative where you hear the words "planet" and "federation" used together almost ten years before those words became legendary.<br /><br />The Excerpts from The MGM Parade TV Series are basically Walter Pidgeon advertising the movie at the end of this TV show.  Short, but can anything with Walter Pidgeon not be great?<br /><br />The All-new Amazing! Exploring the Far Reaches of Forbidden Planet" featurette is a rather good documentary.  I just wish it had been longer, but that's the way it goes.  Ann Francis looks amazingly good even to this day.<br /><br />The Robby the Robot: Engineering a Sci-Fi Icon was an unexpected surprise and very entertaining.  No, it's not the Lost in Space robot.  It's a different robot.  In fact, there's an episode of Lost in Space where both robots appear together.  I wish this documentary had shown us all the places where Robby appeared through the years.  Robby was in an original Twilight Zone episode (as were many of the props from Forbidden Planet) but no mention was made of this.<br /><br />So, the worst thing I can say about the documentaries is that there could have been more, but at least they're there.<br /><br />The TCM documentary Watch the Skies!: Science Fiction, the 1950s and Us seemed like filler, but at least it puts Forbidden Planet in its historical context and illustrates just what a revolutionary movie it was.<br /><br />The Invisible Boy is a barely watchable (unless you just love Mystery Science Theater type corny sci-fi) movie that features the same robot coincidentally (yeah right) named Robby.  In this movie, Robby is evil, and the boy is about the most loathsome and unlikeable boy ever to star in any sci-fi movie I've seen.  I watched this movie on my flat panel TV during a treadmill workout, so at least I didn't waste any time.  If you want to see Robby do evil things and speak with a bad voice, watch this.<br /><br />I haven't watched the Thin Man TV Series Robot Client episode yet.<br /><br />So, there's an overview of the bonus features.  I hope it helps your purchase decision.</p></body></html>

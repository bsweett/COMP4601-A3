<meta name="summary" content="Huge Disappointment"></head><body><p>"The Lovely Bones" should have been a great film in the hands of Peter Jackson who had directed acclaimed "Heavenly Creatures" back in 1994 (feature debut for Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey). "Heavenly Creatures" is a film about intense fantasy and grim reality, some intriguing combination of topics in common with the story of a murdered 14-year-old girl Susie Salmon, the heroine of "The Lovely Bones." Sadly, what we have here is a big sloppy mess of a movie that just doesn't know what it wants to do.<br /><br />Peter Jackson, so intent on the effect-ridden world, never allows us to connect to the characters, including Susie herself. A horrible thing happens to her family, but we don't know much about her parents, young brother and sister. Yes, computer graphics are pretty impressive, but soon we realize this has little to do with the story, or possible themes like metaphorical and spiritual meditation on the loss. Indeed, the story doesn't know where to go, and the film hits the nadir when Susie's free-spirited grandma steps in as "comic relief." Judging from this (and the film's cloying finale), Peter Jackson seems to have forgotten that Susie has not just died, but is brutally murdered.<br /><br />One cannot blame the actors for portraying one-dimensional characters. Saoirse Ronan, so impressive in "Atonement," is pretty good, considering the difficult role she is required to play. Cast-against-type Stanley Tucci is not bad. Actually, he is so good at becoming the character he plays that we start wondering how come people around him missed the obvious thing.<br /><br />Not having read the original bestselling book, I have nothing to say about the liberties Peter Jackson had taken to film "The Lovely Bones." I only imagine that Alice Sebold's book is far more subtle and thought-provoking. The hugely disappointing adaptation is not likely to appeal to either the readers or the viewers.</p></body></html>

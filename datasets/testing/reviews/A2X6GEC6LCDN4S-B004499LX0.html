<meta name="summary" content="Interesting"></head><body><p>As a previous reviewer said, "Closer is basically the ickiest, grossest, most dysfunctional parts of all your past relationships strung together into one movie."  Dysfunctional is the key word here, no one trusts each other, and temptations abound.  What a mess!  Clive Owens and Jude Law are good at playing manipulative jerks and showing us how they attempt to lie themselves out of various sticky situations.  The women in the film, appear to be more of the innocent victims, caught in this web of determinism.  For a look at Julia Roberts in a little bit different of a role, a more serious role, this may be worth it. I'm afraid guys will be gawking at Ms. Portman not for her brilliance, but her body in this one.</p></body></html>

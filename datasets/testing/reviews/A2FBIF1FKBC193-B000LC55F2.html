<meta name="summary" content="Just WAY too complicated ...."></head><body><p>Sorry it had just too too many cute things for me to enjoy it.It isn't till the end of the movie that it becomes clear WHY the wife of one of the main characters knew when her husband said 'I love you' and he meant it and the days when he said it and he didn't mean it ... She says that the day he means it  makes her life worthwhile' ....<br /><br />I dont want to spoil the movie but maybe she should have put a magic marker big X on his rear ..... HMMMMM<br /><br />Ever since I saw the 'Ipcress File' I am a Micheal Cane junkie so The Prestiege got 3 stars otherwise .... well I would have made this movie disappear much faster than the birds they made disappear......<br /><br />If you are a Micheal Cane 'nut' get this movie if not then better to put your hand on the window sill and slam the window shut ... you'll enjoy that more than this movie!!</p></body></html>

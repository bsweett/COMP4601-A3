<meta name="summary" content="A pretty smart zombie movie"></head><body><p>OK, so they aren't zombies, exactly.<br /><br />"Jim" wakes up naked on a hospital bed in an silent ward. Donning some scrubs, he wanders outside into empty London streets. Newspaper headlines blare about evacuations, and bulletin boards are filled with longing pleas for information about the missing. What is wrong becomes more apparent when the sun sets and Jim is beset by a group of wild, thrashing, blood-eyed attackers. He rescued by a pair of strangers wielding flamethrowers, and the film is on.<br /><br />Director Danny Boyle has put together an exciting piece of work that combines the thrills of the science fiction disease genre (a la Andromeda Strain) and the anarchic wackiness of zombie films. His small group of survivors is desperate to find shelter, to avoid contamination and to find others of their kind. Luckily for them, the empty city provides ample food and transportation to do about anything they want, and they head out of the city to follow a faint radio beacon promising safety.<br /><br />To say more is to give too much away. The movie stays fairly believable until about midway, when its lapses increasingly into silliness and implausibility. For all their supposed "pure rage," the infected people could have used a bit more dionysiac, limb-rending fury. And a subtext about dolling up a pair of females before ravishing them seems (in the face of constant threat by crazed zombies) to be an unnecessary and titillating diversion.<br /><br />But "28 Days Later" is entertaining, well-acted (Cillian Murphy as Jim is terrific, especially as a befuddled ex-patient) and tries to be intelligent about a ludicrous situation. The DVD extras include interviews with the film-makers that are self-importantly and silly. But tfilm is also very well shot, with wonderfully evocative shots of abandoned London landmarks and traffic-free English highways. One of the better efforts of the zombie genre, even if they weren't zombies, exactly.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I don't think I even GOT this movie"></head><body><p>Sadly, it's NOT a sequel to Sandra Bullock's '28 Days' - I think I would have enjoyed it more if it had have been. <p>I thought it would have been creepy. It wasn't.<p>I thought the main characters would have ended up being infected. They weren't.<p>The underlying love story? Adam &amp; Eve nonsense, two people forced together, due to them having to repopulate the world or whatever.<p>So what exactly was the point of this film? It seemed disjointed, and seemed to have no idea what direction it wanted to go in. And I nearly fell asleep during it, although I was coming close, and struggling to keep my eyes open, when thankfully it got switched off. Only kidding. It got paused. But that gave me the chance to wake myself and splash my face with cold water. And then I watched the rest of the film. Interesting as it was.<p>It's a British film, which means Americans wouldn't like it, but if they'd done this kind of film, they probably would have over-dramatised it and maybe made a better job. (I said maybe) Being a British movie, it had a real edge to it, to see what Danny Boyle was going to come up with now.<p>The whole love story was totally dense, and felt like it was put together at the last moment. And for any ladies reading this, would you honestly go up to a guy and kiss him, when he's covered in blood? Something tells me you wouldn't. Why did there have to be a love story anyway?<p>There are actually some good points to this movie. Seeing main cities, like London, completely deserted. No people, no cars, nothing. It felt rather eerie.<p>If you like these kind of non-interesting movies, which no one else owns, or even likes, then sure, go for it. Just don't expect a sequel to 28 Days.</p></body></html>

What I found was a really good thrill ride and its a pity that it hasn't done better at the box office!<br /><br />The director doesn't give us much time to blink before the rogue wave hits the huge cruise ship, killing a great deal of the passengers and turning the ship completely upside down.  The survivors, a small group who decide to try and find a way out of the ship, face one challenge after another.  You might think that the action would let up once the ship has been hit, but you would be wrong.  Wolfgang Peterson quicks the action rolling until the end of the movie.<br /><br />The movie is full of stars---Kurt Russell, Emmy Rossum, and Richard Dreyfess, to name a few but the best action hero of the bunch is Josh Lucas, who gets the most harrowing sequences in the film.  The special effects are really good, especially as the wave hits the Poseidon as well as some of the shots inside the ship as it rolls over in the water.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good popcorn movie with lots of action, this is one to see!  Not all movies have to have great plots or Oscar caliber acting to be enjoyed.  Sometimes you just need to sit back and enjoy the ride!  Don't let this one slip out of theaters before you see it on the big screen.  Well worth admission!</p></body></html>

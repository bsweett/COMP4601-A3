<meta name="summary" content="Very different film, left me wanting more"></head><body><p>Enjoyable, thought-provoking alternative to the typical "The Road" type post-apocolyptic film.  Book of Eli takes a new twist, and the acting of Mila Kunis was suprisingly impressive.  She can act.  Jennifer Beals was very good and so was Gary Oldman. The shaking attribute of cannibals was a cool twist, but the star of the show is Eli's faith and the book.</p></body></html>

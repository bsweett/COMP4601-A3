<meta name="summary" content="Some great moments, but not enough of them"></head><body><p>Johnny Depp has so many mannerisms, tics, quirks, glances, and body language tweaks that it would be difficult to catalogue even half of them. Of course Pirates of the Caribbean gave him ample stage room to run through his entire repertoire, so, by comparison, Secret Window comes up a bit short. They're entirely different genres, Pirates being high camp/adventure and Window being creepy horror, but still, there's room for comparison.<br />Depp, excellently cast against the equally well-cast John Turturro, plays a depressed, recently divorced writer who is surprised one day to be approached in his remote lakeside cabin by a distinctly threatening dude with a hillbilly accent and, tho you don't see it, it's clear the guy maybe used to be an axe murderer. He accuses Depp of plagiarism. As this all began with a Stephen King tale, you know where it's heading: into the realm of other-worldly horror stuff.<br />Not Depp's best work, although given what he had to work with, he does a helluva good job of it. And it's well worth watching if only to catch, as you sense he's going bonkers, his increasingly frequent tics that involve mouth and jaw stretching - and biting.</p></body></html>

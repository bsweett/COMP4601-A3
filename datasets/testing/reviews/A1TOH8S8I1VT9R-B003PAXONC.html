<meta name="summary" content="Not bad for what it is,.. ...but it is what it is and what it is begs questions."></head><body><p>By far my dumbest review title, but it gets to the point.  What's the point?  Every time civilization is engulfed in some sort of cannibalistic, zombie-esque plague many questions get begged and then I fail to enjoy the movie.  I hate it when I ruin movies with logic.  I have much more fun when I can let things go.  Unfortunately for me and my wife reality reared its ugly head while watching this film.  Fortunately for the movie, reality does not make it a bad film.  What am I getting at anyway!!?  To save all of us some time, here is a list of bullet statements to explain my problematic reality check of civilizations end (again):<br /><br />(Some of this might be considered "spoiler" material so consider yourself warned)<br />-Why do plagues always turn people into cannibals?  And when they turn into cannibals, why don't they eat each other?  In this film the plague-ridden are maniacal, night dwelling blood suckers.  Don't any of them have blood in their bodies to share?<br /><br />-If animals get said plague, as is the case in this film, why would they not try to eat their plague infected masters?  If the plague turns people into animals does it turn animals into... ...more animals??  I guess we should assume that getting the plague and going nuts ends all bigotry and discrimination not only between races, but also species.  If you have the plague you're cool.  If you don't you're dinner.  Hey, another upside to getting the plague!<br /><br />-In real life a plague weakens and kills people. In movies often the plague that ends civilization turns people into super beings.  Not such a bad deal really.  If I could run like the wind, scamper up walls like a squirrel, knock over cars by running into them and endure copious amounts of pain I'd consider taking up the plague voluntarily and become a superhero.  Of course I'd need to work around that urge to eat my fellow man.<br /><br />-Do the infected reproduce (am I nuts or am I the only one in the theater thinking about this stuff?)?  I mean, if they don't do "the act" aren't they going to disappear after a couple of generations?  If they do commit "the act" do the female plaguies eat the male plaguies when they're done?  I know the zombies don't do it, but you never run out of dead people.  Although, at some point after everyone is a zombie, there is going to be a big rot-fest and everyone will just fall to pieces.  Don't want to be there for that.  In "28 days later" people eventually die of the plague, so that works out nicely.<br /><br />-Since plaguies are crazed animals (sort of) and they don't really do anything but hunt for food and since they don't eat each other, wouldn't they eventually run out of food?  What happens when they eat all the healthy people and animals (Whom they greatly outnumber btw)?  Since they don't eat members of the club, this presents a problem.<br /><br />-Are the plague-ridden impervious to extremes in temperature?  Since they seem to have lost most capacity for manufacturing and electricity is becoming a distant memory, how will they stay warm in the winter?  They run around in rags with nothing on their feet, so finding new cloths seems a low priority. Do they migrate?  Hardly seems likely with that inconvenient allergy to UV light.  They do have a high metabolic rate so maybe that helps.  But, without fur covering there skin, it is more than likely that northern Plaguies would eventually die off due to exposure and cold.<br /><br />-Why do plaguies suddenly have the ability to stretch their facial bones every time they want to yell out with an attack scream?  This is kind of a rip-off from "The Mummy" movie and really looked fake and out of place in this movie.  I liked it in "The Mummy" because that was pure fantasy.  This is sci-fi and it didn't look right.  Using CG was OK for everything else because of the superpowers plaguies possess.  I just don't understand why their jaws needed to stretch.<br /><br />-Does immunity to a zombiesque plague cause you to lose your mind or miss the obvious?  At a crucial point of the movie, we learn that Will is not the sole survivor (a woman and her son pop in).  The woman insists that there are more survivors in a nearby colony.  Will insists there is no one else (boy, does he miss the obvious).  When Will asks the woman why she believes there are more survivors she tells him (paraphrase) "God says so.".  WHAAAA?!?!  She really does not get fact-based debate.  The correct and obvious answer should have been "We're here, aren't we?"  Both people missed the most obvious things and that's just not what real people do.<br /><br />-Do any of us want a future with Will Smith in it?  The prospects are bleak; Alien invasion wiping out most of humanity.  Robot rebellion.  Plague infested world full of vampires.  I pick the robots.<br /><br />In the Chuck Hesston version "Omega Man", the plague victims become cult members.  Never is cannibalism ever mentioned.  They simply want to get Chuck because he's not one of them and he wants to "cure" who they are.  That makes things a lot more feasible in the long run.  "I Am Legend" makes a similar point.  He treats the plaguies like animals (a reputation well earned) and subsequently becomes their enemy.  In the end, there are questions who the bad guy is (at least I thought so).<br /><br /> There are plenty of tense and scary scenes in which Will Smith does a great job.  A very well made movie that beg lots of silly questions from one silly guy.  These questions kind of ruined the movie for me though.  I would actually recommend avoiding at the theater and buying on DVD.  Theaters are just too expensive these days and there is little advantage to seeing it on the big screen.  Overall a fun movie but you will need to stop asking so many goofy questions if you want to enjoy it.</p></body></html>

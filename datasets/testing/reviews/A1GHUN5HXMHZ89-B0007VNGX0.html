<meta name="summary" content="Good Sequel"></head><body><p>This is a great sequel to the original. Although it didn't seem as dark and scary as the first, it made up for it in action. The movie picks up where the first one left off. As our heroine has escaped the hospital she finds a devastated world. She must find her only surviving friend and do what she can to bring the Umbrella Corporation down. She finds out more horrible truths about them and is assisted by a unlikely allie. Both movies complement each other nicely. I definitely recommend you add this to your Horror/SciFi collection. A must for anyone that owns "Resident Evil". I am looking forward to the third movie in this set.</p></body></html>

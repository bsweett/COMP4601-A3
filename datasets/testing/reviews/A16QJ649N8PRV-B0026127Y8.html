<meta name="summary" content="A Great Action Thriller"></head><body><p>This is a fast paced adventure that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats.<br /><br />It features Liam Neeson as Bryan Mills, a retired CIA operative.  His daughter has been kidnapped by white slavers.  Mills speaks to one of her abductors on the phone and gives them a chance to release her.  He makes it clear that he does not have money to pay a ransom, but 'I have a particular set of skills' and 'I will find you and I will kill you'.<br /><br />Mills functions quite a bit like Jack Bauer.  In other words, the bad guys better watch out because it is going to get very ugly for them very quickly.<br /><br />This is a very intense show that is a lot of fun to watch.</p></body></html>

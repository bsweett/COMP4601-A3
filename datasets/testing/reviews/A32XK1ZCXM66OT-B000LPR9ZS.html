I mean, Tobin Bell can do no wrong as Jigsaw the killer!!! He is truly an amazing actor. Now as for the storyline, it is a simple yet very intense one. Jigsaw and Amanda have set up another twisted game for two people. One is a female doctor who is having an affair on her husband and the other is a man who hasn't come to terms with the death of his young son. Who was the victim of a car accident at the hands of a drunk driver. But the two of them will have to figure out their connection to one another, to survive Jigsaw's game and to make matters worse. Jigsaw may not have that long to live, as he too must fight to stay alive long enough to finish is his dangerous game.</p></body></html>

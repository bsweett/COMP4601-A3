When I first saw this movie back in 1987, I was overwhelmed by its originality and felt it was very suspenseful.  I guess since we've come such a long way since then, my latest viewing awakened me to some of the film's major flaws:  it takes too long to have the Predator do his thing.  While I agree that not showing him builds suspense, too much time was spent on the guerilla battle.  It served to slow things down for me.  The addition of the female hostage was also bothersome in that she really didn't add anything to the film, and there was no reason to spare her when all the other guerillas bit the dust.  The soldiers are the stereotype of any kind of jungle/rescue mission movie, and Arnold's cigar chomping is getting old and redundant.  However, once the predator starts taking center stage, the movie regains its momentum and plays out well.  How did Arnold survive the nuclear blast at the end?  Where did the alien come from and why was he here?  These are the things that keep me from giving it a 5.</p></body></html>

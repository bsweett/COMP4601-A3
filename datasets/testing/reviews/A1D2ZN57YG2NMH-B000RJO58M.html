<meta name="summary" content="A Classic Film With Very Few Flaws"></head><body><p>"Hot Fuzz" is one of the greatest satires of all time. It's heartwarming, charming, outrageous and super memorable. If you've seen "Shaun of the Dead" expect the same smorgasbord of genres here. There's a little parody, a little "British TV" comedy, a little drama, a little mystery, a little horror... It's all here! I can honestly call this one of my favorite films.<br /><br />A CAUTION<br />There are a few comments in this film that I felt were incredibly misplaced. First off the use of the "c" word towards the middle of the film was uncalled for and somewhat that I believe will shock most american viewers. Not tasteful...<br /><br />Secondly, there are some extremely off color "double entendres" by the female cop that are just flat out gross. These moments are so scarce, you barely remember them when the film ends, but they're always annoying and most uncalled for.<br /><br />Thirdly, the film is extremely violent... Gushing blood and decapitation are played up for laughs (and I didn't find this element offensive) but if you are squeemish, I wouldn't recommend it.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />Awesome movie! I really can't recommend this one enough to viewers willing to ignore a few bumps in the road.</p></body></html>

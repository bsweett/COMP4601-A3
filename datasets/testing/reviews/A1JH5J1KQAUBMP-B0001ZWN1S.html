<meta name="summary" content="Among the greatest American films"></head><body><p>Writer/director Francis Ford Coppola's classic film takes us deep into the world of Mafia don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and his sons--Michael (Al Pacino), the all-American war hero who is destined to lose his soul and spend the rest of his life in repentance; Sonny (James Caan), the hot-tempered eldest son who is next in line; Fredo (John Cazale), weak and simple-minded but good-hearted; and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the adopted son who acts as family lawyer and councilor.  Every element of this film is perfect.  I've seen it and its sequels more than a dozen times and am always caught up in this fascinating epic.  Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo never allow us outside the circle of the Corleones, so it is their values that define good and evil in this film, not the mores of society at large.  Simply put, loyalty to the family is seemingly all that matters.  Then why, when Michael finally decides to involve himself inextricably in the affairs of the family out of concern for his father, does he become such a cold and feared figure instead of revered, beloved, and respected like his father?  This is the most interesting question in a deep and serious work of cinematic art./</p></body></html>

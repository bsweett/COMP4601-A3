No this movie (based on the King story) is classic in the sense that so many of the elements of this story have already appeared in other works from the horror maestro. Throughout the movie shades from both `The Shining' and `The Dark Half' abound and ultimately detract from the presentation with a distinct sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu and `they did it better in...' pervading the movie.<br /><br />The story centers around a washed up writer Mort Rainey (played by Johnny Depp) consumed in alcohol and depression over a failed marriage and writers block who is shocked by the arrival of a stranger who accuses him of stealing his story (the `Secret Window' of the title). Things get worse for Mort as Shooter becomes increasingly violent and Rainey slips deeper into paranoia and insanity before a shocking climax. Depp does his best with the material he is given and this movie at times comes close to creating some real chilling scenes. John Turturro also turns in a memorable performance as John Shooter and Maria Bello elicits a great deal of sympathy as Morts (soon-to-be) ex-wife Amy, a character wracked with uncertainty about stepping out after the shelter of married life.<br /><br />Supporting performances by Timothy Hutton and Charles Dutton are both admirable, if both the characters they portray are slim on actual characterization and Len Cariou turns in a surprisingly good performance as Sheriff Newsome.<br /><br />Good for fans of the genre and people looking to be mildly entertained, just don't go in expecting to be particularly surprised by anything.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Redgrave and Ronan are great. The rest I could have skipped."></head><body><p>When Vanessa Redgrave shows up late in the film as the senior Briony, things get interesting because she's a fine actress who captures emotion well.  The younger version of Briony, played by Saiorse Ronan, is also quite watchable.  I wish I could say the same for the rest of the film.<br />I couldn't feel anything for the other characters, who are by turns obnoxious, mean, or just plain stupid.  Robbie in particular is an idiot--he writes a disgusting fantasy note, forgets that it's the wrong one, and lets it be delivered to the object of his desire.  Despite the obscenity of it, she likes it.  Please--give me a break.<br />It wasn't much fun to have to spend nearly two hours with such people.<br />Another problem is that McEvoy and Knightley have no chemistry.  I never detected a hint of passion between them.<br />Yet another flaw in the film lies in the unnecessary semi-flashbacks.  This narrative device works in some films but not so much in this one.  All it does here is slow things down, then stop and restart them for no good reason.<br />This did not deserve a Best Picture nomination.</p></body></html>

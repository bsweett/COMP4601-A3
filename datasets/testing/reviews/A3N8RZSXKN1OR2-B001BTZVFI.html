<meta name="summary" content="A fantastic adventure"></head><body><p>I was never a fan of the FF comic, so I only know the basic facts about the team, and if I could enjoy this film, so can anyone else who isn't terribly familiar with them.  I found it far better than Daredevil <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000959N0">Daredevil (Full Screen Edition)</a>, definitely equal to X-Men <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYELVA">X-Men (Widescreen Edition)</a>, and almost as good as Spider-Man <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKCH">Spider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition)</a>.  Reed Richards, a brilliant scientist but a terrible businessman (and not too good at relationships either), and his lifelong friend and boyhood bodyguard Ben Grimm are in search of funding with which to prove Reed's hypothesis that a long-ago cosmic storm was responsible for the development of humanity.  To do this, they need to get into space, and NASA has refused them.  But billionaire Victor Von Doom, who has his own space station, doesn't--on condition that they sign over to him 75% of all profits and patents resulting from the experiment, let him go along (and take his science-projects director, Sue Storm, who is Reed's former girlfriend), and pick the pilot (Sue's brother Johnny, who washed out of NASA for his hotdogging and prankstering).  (Interestingly, we see on board the station that the Marvel Universe is definitely scientifically ahead of our own: the facility seems to have artificial gravity.)  While Ben is on a spacewalk, the cosmic storm Reed knew was coming speeds up, and everyone gets a whopping dose of radiation before Doom can close the shields.  At first, back on Earth, it seems they've come through unharmed.  Then Johnny, helicopter-skiing with a nurse he's met, literally starts to burst into flames, and Ben undergoes a transformation into a creature only superficially human.  Soon afterward, Reed realizes that he can extend any portion of his body, and Sue that she can turn invisible when under emotional stress.  (Last to transform is Doom, who slowly turns into a being made of some kind of organic metal.)  Reed wants to try to reverse the process, and Ben, who's dismayed by his new form, is happy to let him.  Even Sue is ambivalent about her new power.  Only Johnny seems to understand that there's more to being the self-named Human Torch than being an idol of millions; "What if this happened for a reason?" he insists.  Meanwhile Doom, whose company has tanked from the unfavorable publicity, has resolved to destroy Reed...<br /><br />With typical Marvel angst, wonderful special effects, and an attractive cast, this is definitely one of the best of the recent crop of Marvel-based films.  One of the most visually stunning sequences is a wild multi-car accident on a New York bridge (begun when Ben tries to save a would-be suicide), climaxing with an ovation for the quartet from drivers, cops, and firefighters alike: unlike Spider-Man, the Fantastic-Four-to-be are obviously accepted from the start by officialdom.  (There's also an almost equally splendid battle with Doom in the midst of the New York street.)  Each of the Four is a clearly marked individual of whom the script makes the most that time will allow, and Doom is a wonderfully smooth and sinister presence even before his ultimate villainy comes into play.  Nothing in the movie seems especially frightening, either, so it can be recommended for all ages--and I do.  This is another DVD I intend to add to my collection as soon as I can.</p></body></html>

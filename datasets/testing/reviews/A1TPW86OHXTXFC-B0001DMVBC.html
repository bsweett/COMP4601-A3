<meta name="summary" content="The House of Ruined Dreams"></head><body><p>Moving, sad and enthralling movie is &quot;The House of Sand and Fog&quot;.<br />Andre Dubois wrote the book and received over 100 offers for the movie rights. The movie does the book justice. The photography is<br />superb and the sand and fog surround the house and the movie. Jennifer Connelly follows up her Academy Award performance in another dark film- she is brilliant and believable. Ben Kingsley as always is so &quot;right on&quot; in his interpretation of his character. He is a fomer military man in the Iraq Army, and is ramrod straight and honest. He does not flinch, not once.<p>Jennifer Connelly is removed from her family home for not paying a tax that turns out to be a mistake. Jennifer, it sems has given up drinking and is depressed and never opens her mail. Thus she never sees the bill. Once removed from her home, she is befriended by a local policeman who is lonely and feels sorry for her. This develops into a romance- the man is married and has children and all these lives become intertwined with despair and depression. <p>Into this morass comes Ben Kingsley looking for a home to buy, to repair and sell at a premium. He and his family are living beyond their means- he is working at two jobs to keep up the facade. His plan is to move to the house while they are fixing it up and relieving himself of the stress of the bills and the many hours of work.  He finds the ad for this home for sale at a very large discount- buys the home and then all hell breaks loose.  The juxtaposition of his family heirlooms, gold and silver and glass in a seaside cottage gives the movie an unearthly feel.  <p>Jennifer and her policeman try to get the home back but their plans fall apart. Jennfier starts to slide down that ugly black hole, and all the lives involved fall apart. <p>This is a breath-takingly beautiful movie- so well acted it is real. Academy Award performances abound in this movie. This is not a movie for the squeamish- blood and suspense are plentiful.  Recommended highly! prisrob</p></body></html>

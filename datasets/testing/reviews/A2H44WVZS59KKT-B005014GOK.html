It's about time that he got a lead role - and I'm glad that it is in "Machete" - a role that fits him perfectly.<br /><br />What a rock 'em, sock 'em, cut 'em up movie - loads of grindhouse fun.  Trejo was perfect as the ex-Federale vigilante freedom fighter.  Oh, and of course, ladies' man!  The cast is full of big names and beautiful women.  The dialogue goes between bigoted, political vitriol and over-the-top sound bites.<br /><br />Violence - and I do mean violence which includes blood, GUTS, and everything in between; nudity; drugs.  Do you get the hint that this isn't a children's film?<br /><br />But I loved it for what it was - a tribute to drive-in movies, splatter films, Mexploitation films, maybe chambara films.  And let's have Trejo in more lead roles!</p></body></html>

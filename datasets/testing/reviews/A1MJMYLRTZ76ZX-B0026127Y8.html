<meta name="summary" content="Great action role for Neeson but that's about it"></head><body><p>Well, it is safe to say that this is Liam Neeson as you never seen him before--as a death-dealing, super James Bond field agent who comes out of retirement to rescue his daughter who has been kidnapped into the international sex slave trade. There's not much plot here that's not predictable, but that's not the point of this movie. It's an opportunity for Neeson to play a super-cool secret agent who can hand out more death and mayhem in one day than your typical American company on the skids can hand out pink slips on a Friday afternoon. Who's to say which is deadlier? :-)<br /><br />Well, for now I'll go with the mature Neeson as he sends dozens of Euro-nasties to an early grave in this unabashed, rock-'em, sock-'em revenge thriller that is sort of like the AARP meets "The Bourne Identity." I give it four stars for all the interesting and ingenious action sequences but don't expect much in the way of nuanced acting from Neeson who is certainly capable of much more.</p></body></html>

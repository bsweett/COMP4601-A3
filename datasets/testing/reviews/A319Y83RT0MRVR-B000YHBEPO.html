And I should know, I own and have seen all but one of his movies (War of the Worlds). The plot of the first Mission Impossible was too convoluted (I even read the novelization of it to throughly understand it), whereas the plot of the second mission Impossible movie was too dumbed down (after so many complains about the first movie). This third installment manages to combine the wits of the first film with the stunts and visual beauty of the second. Make no mistake, at the end of the day, this movie is nothing more than a very good thriller, but with Cruise and Philip Seymour Hoffman's performances and strong support from Ving Rhames, this movie delights and entertains without missing a beat. And, at the end of the day, isn't this why we love movies so much?</p></body></html>

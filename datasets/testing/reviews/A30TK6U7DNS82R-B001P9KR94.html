<meta name="summary" content="Movie of the Year?"></head><body><p>Well, I resisted seeing this movie but finally I caved in, and I had no idea of just how bad it is.  After about 20 minutes I turned to the other patrons of the theater and cried out like Augustus O'Reilly in A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES, "Can no one deliver me from such pap?!<br /><br />I had the chance to see this on a double bill with Liam Neeson in TAKEN, and it so happens that they are exactly the same movie, presented in exactly the same way.  Both films depend on the continually postponed deflowering of an underage girl, and the plot of each revolved around the efforts of the hero to prevent this from happening.  So both stories becomes one man against the underworld of the gang, gangs grown rich by preying on the need of sinister, jaded men for the flesh of the young girl.  Life is a crusade against sexual sin led by Dev Patel on the one hand, Liam Neeson on the other.  This crusade allows and encourages violence of all sorts, in the name of protecting the girl.  I expect this feeds into real life violence perpetuating purity.  I enjoyed TAKEN though, while SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is unredeemable and condescending filmmaking which even AR Rahman's energetic score can't pretty up.</p></body></html>

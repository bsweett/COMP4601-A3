<meta name="summary" content="ACTION, ADVENTURE & TRAVEL TO FAR AWAY LANDS! ORIGINAL 4 DISC BOX SET REVIEW!"></head><body><p>I bought the original box set many months ago on sale for a bargain price. Reading all the reviews for the new Indy installment, I wanted to watch the original 3 films again, before eventually seeing the new one. This box set contains the first 3 movies and an extra disc with a fair amount of extra material. The DVD's look and sound great and it has enough features on it to keep me happy until some day buying a "Blue Ray" version.<br /><br />Watching the original "Raiders" was quite fun as I haven't watched the film in years! The DVD transfer is excellent and the audio is more than adequate on the original 4 DVD box set release not the newest release. This film still holds up well and could be labeled the definitive action adventure film without any arguments.<br /><br />Ford is perfectly cast as the elusive whip-cracking archeologist and Allen is great as his very capable love interest. It's a one of kind film that has been copied so much it's hard to remember when this was fresh and new! The first film is the best by a mile, but I will be reviewing all the films as I watch them!<br /><br />1) Raiders Of The Lost Ark - 5 Stars<br />2) Temple Of Doom - 4 Stars<br />3) Last Crusade - 4 1/2 Stars</p></body></html>

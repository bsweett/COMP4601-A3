DVD REVIEW!"></head><body><p>Ridley Scott's 1978 film, &quot;Alien&quot; changed the face of horror/science-fiction thrillers and turned the relatively-unknown Sigourney Weaver into a major Hollywood superstar. For its 25th anniversary, Fox Entertainment released a new &quot;director's cut&quot; of the film into theatres. While it didn't do nearly as well as they had hoped, the new two-disc DVD features both the original classic and the new director-approved edition. <p>While &quot;Alien&quot; may not quite be viewed by today's audiences as the landmark suspense film that it was in its day, it is still an exceptionally-done and exciting film. Such moments as John Hurt's &quot;chest-burster&quot; sequence, the Ash robot struggle, and the concluding confrontation between Ripley and the Alien are all so thoroughly well-done. Having the sole survivor of the film be a female is still very rarely seen in films today though most of the film's other major plot twists have been ripped off time and time again by other film-makers over the years. <p>While the &quot;director's cut&quot; does feature some new added scenes, it actually runs a minute shorter than the original as Ridley Scott has also taken out scenes that he feels have not aged well. I actually prefer the older version though a new sequence featuring the infamous &quot;cocoon&quot; scene is worth checking out. Both versions feature a full-length commentary from the cast and crew including Ridley Scott and Sigourney Weaver. <p>This double-disc edition has even more special features to offer than just both versions of the movie. The featurettes on the making of the film are very intriguing and insightful and offer a glimpse into the potential problems that the crew faced. It's also interesting to learn that this film was actually originally planned as a low-budget Roger Corman picture. There's also so more deleted footage from the film that didn't make the &quot;director's cut&quot; on disc two. <p>If you are even a slight fan of the &quot;Alien&quot; series, this DVD has everything that you could possibly want. You can get this two-disc &quot;special edition&quot; either by itself or as part of the nine-disc &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot; boxed set.</p></body></html>

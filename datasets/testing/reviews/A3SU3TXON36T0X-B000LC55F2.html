<meta name="summary" content="The Prestige:  A Gruesome Tale of Rival Magicians."></head><body><p>_The Prestige_ (2006) is a movie based on a book by the same name featuring a rivalry between two stage magicians in late 19th century London.  The movie itself demonstrates the extremes to which many magicians of the period were willing to go in order to pull off their stunts.  The movie also explains many of these tricks, including such tricks as escaping from a locked box underwater with hands tied, the appearance of a fish bowl from under a cloth (practiced by a Chinese magician who was willing to go through life pretending to be a cripple in order to avoid his trick being found out), the infamous "bullet catch", the disappearance and reappearance of a bird, and ultimately the "teleported man".  The movie title is a fitting one, which can be understood once the movie has been watched.  It refers to the fact that there are three stages to a magical act (as explained by the older magician at the beginning of the movie).  These stages are as follows:  "the pledge" (in which the magician shows the audience something that appears ordinary), "the turn" (where the magician makes the ordinary act extraordinary, such as by disappearing), and "the prestige" (where the final effect of the illusion is produced, such as the reappearance of the object).  It is to the question of exactly how "the prestige" is played out in the so-called "teleported man" trick that the movie must address.  The movie features a dark atmosphere in Victorian London and shows the dangers of obsession.  The movie also features a cameo appearance by the eccentric scientist and inventor Nikola Tesla (whose bizarre inventions were far ahead of his time, and who is still believed by many to have discovered many secrets which remain uncovered at this time).  In this movie, Tesla does manage to develop something that is truly extraordinary (in his rivalry with Thomas Edison) and the true gruesome nature of this discovery as played out in the magical act of one of the magicians is not revealed until the end.<br /><br />To begin with the movie starts out with both magicians Alfred Borden and Robert Angier as assistants to Milton the magician.  In their effort to stretch the boundaries of their magical skills, the magicians concoct a stunt in which Angier's wife has her hands and legs tied and is then placed into a tank of water with a locked top.  During one of the performances, Borden may have tied a knot which Angier's wife could not escape from (though he cannot remember exactly which knot he tied) and this leads to the tragedy of Angier's wife drowning within the box before it can be broken open.  Angier blames Borden for his wife's death and thus begins the rivalry between the two magicians.  During one of his performances, Borden attempts to perform the notoriously dangerous "bullet catch"; however, Angier arrives in the crowd in disguise and volunteers to fire the gun at Borden.  Borden is injured because of Angier's tampering and thus loses two fingers.  Later in the movie, Borden performs a bizarre stunt called the "teleported man", in which he enters one door and reappears instantaneously at another door halfway across the stage.  (As will be discovered later in the movie, this "stunt" has a personal effect on him and involves great sacrifice.)  In an effort to one-up Borden, Angier (calling himself "The Great Danton") must resort to extreme measures.  Originally he uses a double to perform the same trick; however, this soon proves impossible as his double turns on him.  So he must visit Tesla who lives in Colorado in America at the time.  Tesla devises a special method for Angier to conduct his trick.  To see how the rest of the movie is resolved you must watch as it plays out.  However, the ending is particularly gruesome, as obsession becomes murderous.  Both men turn out to have taken extreme measures to perform this trick and the costs include human lives.  (Note:  The eerie foreshadowing in the magical trick involving the bird.  In which, the bird must be murdered in order for the trick to work.)<br /><br />This movie is a thoroughly enjoyable one and has been compared to another movie about stage magic which recently came out called _The Illusionist_.  Both movies are very good though they are quite different from each other.  This movie is certainly entertaining but ultimately very gruesome and not for the overly squeamish.  It is certainly worth watching however if you can appreciate being dazzled by the uncanny individuals who practice stage magic.</p></body></html>

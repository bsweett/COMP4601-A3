<meta name="summary" content="Almost as good as the first!!!"></head><body><p>I really liked this movie. I loved Saw, but I was a little disapointed with Saw 2. Saw 3 more than makes up for it! The tests and death scenes are gruesome, and the characters are more likeable and realistic. There are many twists and turns, and I can't wait to see Saw 4! It'll have to be pretty good to keep up to this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the best movies of the year!"></head><body><p>Clearly co-producer Steven Spielberg and writer/director J. J. Abrams wanted to paint a picture-perfect homage to the former's great classics of the 70's and 80's.  This movie succeeds without qualification.  Set in the late 70's in a small Ohio blue collar town, a youngster tries to overcome the accidental death of his mother.  Joe (Joel Courtney) has a rocky relationship with his father and police deputy played by the always good Kyle Chandler.  Joe and his friends are making a student film using a period icon, the super 8 camera.  During the filming late at night they witness the crash of a train that has not only an unusual cause but mysterious after effects.  The crash itself is a highlight, even though railroad cars shooting into the sky like missiles seems highly unlikely.  Still it is well done.  During the events, Joe also begins a flirtation with comely Alice played with unusual tenderness by Elle Fanning.  Make no mistake this girl can act.  Their budding romance is beautiful to watch and one that most of us adults wish we would have had when we were teeny boppers.  The "monster" in the story is kept from view most of the time ala "Jaws" but he eventually surfaces and wrecks carnage all over town.  The ending is a bit tidy, but there is no mistaking this well crafted near masterpiece and was the surprise of the summer.<br /><br />In a second viewing I saw the movie in IMAX. Is it worth the extra money?  No.  The film is obviously larger so we see more skin pores and blemishes, but it doesn't add much to the overall scale of the film.  While the film has an extraordinary train crash, and a violent alien creature, the movie is centered on the relationships between kids crashing puberty.  Joel Courtney as Joe and Elle Fanning as the slightly older Alice are terrific.  "Super 8" shows that a movie primarily about kids (making a home movie), doesn't have to be a "kid movie".  Let Jim Carrey and the Penguins cover that territory.<br /><br />2-11-12:  Blu ray update - The transfer has excellent clarity.  It is crisp and detailed.  Very little grain.  The Dolby TrueHD is spectacular.  The freight train crash will test your equipment.  The audio is reference quality.  The extras are all in HD which is nice.  Included are a DVD and Digital Copy along with deleted scenes, 90 minutes of featurettes and a deconstruction of the train crash.</p></body></html>

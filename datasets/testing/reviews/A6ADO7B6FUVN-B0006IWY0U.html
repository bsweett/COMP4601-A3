This war is not only fought on land as what separates England and Europe is the English Channel.  There is also wealth and other items that can be retrieved from different continents around the world that could help each nation in the war.  In the middle of the war the HMS Surprise, a British frigate, whose captain, Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe), has been ordered to seek and destroy the French ship Acheron.  The story surrounds the quest of seeking to destroy this French vessel, which becomes a great adventure where Weir involves the audience by displaying all the different layers of  crew members on the HMS Surprise.  Nonetheless, the story focuses on two characters, Captain Jack Aubrey and the ship surgeon Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany).<p>Jack Aubrey is a resolute, yet understanding man who has served on the HMS Surprise ever since he was a early teenager.  Through years of experience Jack has learned to rely on his resourceful mind instead of taught naval strategy, which has kept the HMS Surprise afloat for many years.  Dr. Stephen Maturin is a freethinking scientist that has an infinite curiosity to learn new information or to make new discoveries.  These two men, also friends, contrast each other as they have different notions, which conflict with their interests.  There is one scene where Dr. Maturin studies the life and the complexity of life as the audience can hear Captain Aubrey's voice echoing in the background while laughing and chatting about memories of war.  This scene manage to display an analogy as it suggests the difficulty through which life is accomplished, and simultaneously, how easy one could destroy life.  This analogy serves is great example of how these two men complement each other and create an harmonious atmosphere on board a ship in war time.<p>Master and Commander is an engaging film on many levels as Peter Weir presents the composition of the crew through several sub plots that involve several different themes in a male dominated environment.  These themes provide much food for thought as they open many new doors.  The complexity to Weir's seafaring tale is of great depth as it portrays both a swashbuckling adventure and a philosophical dialogue, which any audience will enjoy on either a visual or cerebral level.  Lastly, the cast performs superbly and is supported by marvelous cinematography, which is blended with masterful directing.  This leaves the audience with a brilliant cinematic experience that has several lessons, which can be both interesting and educational for many generations.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Worthy Sequel For a Queen"></head><body><p>Others have covered the details sufficiently, so I will stick to a simple review.  This sequel was one of those rare films that was as good as the original in every aspect.  When a sequel is this good, it doesn't have to rehash the first film, it can just get on with the story telling.  Fine work, a worthy watch, enjoy!</p></body></html>

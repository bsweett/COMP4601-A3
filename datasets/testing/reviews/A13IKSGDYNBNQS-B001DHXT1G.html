It starts very well with Dr Banner in South America trying to control the urge within him. This reminded me of the first part of Batman Begins. Controlled film-making where you get to know the characters and they develop in front of your eyes.<br /><br />After that it was a little bit downhill. Too much CGi that wasn't always that good and the battle of the giants at the end was entirely predictable.<br /><br />Edward Norton was fine, when he was Banner, and its a shame we couldn't have had more of Tim Roth, but once they both morphed into their respective gamma-fuelled monsters I was less impressed.<br /><br />That said the use of the still memorable TV series theme tune, was a great idea, and there were lovely cameo roles for Stan Lee, Lou Ferrigno and Robert Downey Jr. Overall its certainly worth seeing but not quite the film I was hoping for....</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Moore opens a can of worms with his worthwhile film on health care"></head><body><p>47 million people are without health insurance. The United States is ranked just above many third world nations in terms of its overall health care. The average life expectancy in the U.S. is three years less than in Canada. Moore rattles off some interesting statistics about the business of health care. He focuses, however, on individuals who have health care with conditions that are denied routine treatment because they suddenly become "experimental" or retroactively deny benefits that have been approved because a health insurnace company has found a loop hole. Moore's film has its own editorial point of view or slant (how could it not?) whether or not you agree with him will largely depend upon your experience with health care in this country and the impact the film makes on you.<br /><br />I particularly found touching the vingette on the woman who's husband was denied a bone marrow transplant because it was "experimental". The man's brother was a match and it looked good that he would have a chance. He died after his last chance at treatment was denied.<br /><br />There is also a story about a woman who had a daughter denied treatment because she was taken to an ER that didn't take their health insurance. While that is unusual, it documents the corporate issues that can contribute to the death of a child.<br /><br />While socialized medicine may not be the key here (there are plenty of complaints about waiting lists for treatment, limits on doctors, etc.), we need to have a way to untie coverage from employment and allow patients to receive reliable, good coverage from haalth insurance companies. More importantly, though, we need to have ethical reviews of practices to may sure this fiasco doesn't occur again for patients presented in the film.<br /><br />More of an editorial than a documentary, Michael Moore's "Sicko" although far from perfect, provides an education on the problems within the health care system in the United States. Politics always play a part in any discussion of health care and this one is no different. There are those who disagree with Moore that our health care system is broken and just as many that suggest we could take a lesson from other nations about how the to effectively treat others with universal health care.<br /><br />The film comes with a number of special features including "Sicko Goes to Washington" where Moore went to nation's capitol to see if the Rep. John Conyers sponsored bill HR 676 to reform the health care system could be passed. We hear some horrible stories and see some of the actions that CNA (California Nurse's Association) and others are taking to try and change things.<br /><br />"This Country Beats France" focuses on Norway where health care is the #1 country for literacy, education and healthcare as well as per capita income. We rank #66.<br /><br />"Uniquely American" focuses on the community fundraiser to help the sick.<br /><br />"What If You Worked for GE in France?" looks at benefits working for an American company where employees get five weeks paid vacation, RTT days in France, works 35 hours a week and gets other benefits WE as Americans don't enjoy. Clearly I need to move to France.<br /><br />We also get the Hollywood premiere of the movie and a music video. Moore also had a premiere in Skid Row in L.A. at the same time as the Hollywood premiere with all the celebrities.<br /><br />"Sister Mary Fidel" and "Who Would Jesus Deny?", "More with Mike & Tony Benn" and an interview gallery round out the special features for this set.<br /><br />Every documentary has its point-of-view and editorial slant. Michael Moore's film "Sicko" is no different in that regard. However, Moore's take on health care in the United States is on target more often than not and the inaccuracies are pretty minor overall. Sure, there is no idealized perfect health care system. There are better ones than we currently have in the United States.</p></body></html>

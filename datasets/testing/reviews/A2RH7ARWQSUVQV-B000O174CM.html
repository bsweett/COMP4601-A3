The women in the film sparkle with both talent, grace and beauty.  The men, both entertainers and agents, are sleazy enough to want to make you take a good both after watching them.  They are acquisitive, double-dealing and sleazy.  Eddie Murphy as a James Brown surrogate does an especially great job.  Consumed by intemperance and drugs he crashes out before the end of the movie.  It is a little difficult to understand why the female "Dreams" love these creeps but...hey...it's Hollywood.<br /><br />"The Dreams" are fairly clearly styled on the "Supremes" and their music and back up verges on the spectacular.  The choreography is every bit as good as the original 'Supremes", maybe better.  Effie, as the not quite so pretty and a little overweight member of the developing group that will become the "Dreams", is especially good.  Despite the fact that she is the most talented member of the group she is tossed aside because their agent thinks she doesn't fit the beautiful image of the other girls.  We feel her hurt and humiliation as she tries to survive without the music she loves.  Effie, if I'm not mistaken, is an Aretha Franklin type character, not beautiful, perhaps, but a terrific talent.<br /><br />Anyway, most of the scuzzy men in the film are ultimately left in the dust but the glorious 'Dreams' go on to greater glory.<br /><br />Ron</p></body></html>

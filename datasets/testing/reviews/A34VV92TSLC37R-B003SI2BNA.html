<meta name="summary" content="A "horror" movie that fails on every level."></head><body><p>I like to consider myself open to all kinds of horror films.  I don't care if they're cheaply made, badly acted, or not well thought out, as long as they do one of two things: either make me jump a couple times, or at least have some good gore.<br /><br />Dahlia Williams is moving into an apartment with her daughter on Roosevelt Island.  Dahlia is going through a divorce (backstory) and is under a lot of stress due to her current situation.  The apartment seems nice at first, until she notices a leak in the bedroom.  From that point, the movie never seems to have any focus.  Are we supposed to be worrying about the leak? the imaginary friend? the obnoxious tenants of the building? Dahlia's divorce?  It's never made clear until the end, when we get the classic revelation of what happened in the apartment upstairs, and why it's affecting Dahlia.<br /><br />Dark Water cannot be considered a horror movie.  The only reason it falls into that category is because the storyline involves a ghost.  There are no scares in this movie.  There are no scary moments.  There is no tension, whatsoever.  Quite simply, this is one of the worst, most disappointing "horror" movies that I have ever seen.</p></body></html>

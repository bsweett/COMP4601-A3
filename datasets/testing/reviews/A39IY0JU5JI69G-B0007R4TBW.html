I think it's a coming-to-life story....something that some people never do, at any age.  I've read the staggering statisics of the number of people on medication, legal and illegal in our fair land, and it's not a pretty fact. To reduce the film to it's basic message: it's better to face the pain of life--that's where the joy is.  But it's so much more than a message film.<br /><br />This is a deceptively simple story but it's so wise and so well told that it really touches the heart.  I don't have TV so I didn't know who Zach Braff was.  Now I do!  I will look for his work in the future.<br /><br />I won't re-tell the story because it's been told enough times here.<br />I just want to add my applause to the others'.  Braff very skillfully walks the line between humour and pathos.  His character has been likened to that of Dustin Hoffman in "The Graduate" but I think this is much better.  The whole cast is super.  It was great to see the wonderful Jean Smart in a small role, as the mom of his grave-robbing buddy.  Ian Holm plays his father, an unsympathetic character, in a very human way that does give the viewer the glimpse of a fundamentally decent man who is as lost in the events of his life as everyone else.<br /><br />Much of the joy and magic of the film goes to Natalie Portman who plays the wonderfully screwy epileptic girl, Sam, who helps the Braff character come back to life.  The role is well written but it could have been butchered in the hands of a lesser actress.  I just saw her in "The Other Boleyn Girl" where I didn't much like her, so I was amazed at how good she was here.  Her naturalness really made the character touch your heart.  This is the sign of a good actress and good direction.<br /><br />There's more I could say but there are a lot of excellent reviews here.  I predict this film will become a classic, 'cuz it has such enduring qualities of real humanity, humour, wisdom and warmth.  My favorite scene: the family watching the video of Sam ice-skating in her alligator outfit---so dear!</p></body></html>

If you haven't seen this film yet, don't pass it up as it is a fascinating story about a true life con man who passed as a Airline Pilot, Doctor, lawyer and wrote about 4 million dollars worth of bad checks....all by the time he was 19 years old. I'm sure there have been some liberties taken with the story, but this film will keep your attention from start to finish The two disc DVD transfer looks very good and there are a ton of extras.</p></body></html>

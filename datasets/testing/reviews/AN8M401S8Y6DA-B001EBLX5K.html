<meta name="summary" content="Movie is good the show is better.  Also to the extreme negative reviews."></head><body><p>Da ali G show the compleet sereez is about twice the money but 4 times and 16mins more, and pretty much all the sketches in the movie are done on the show.<br />I saw this in theaters and thought it was funny but as i said i still like the show better.  As far as being shocking, i was not personally offended or shocked.  Basically in movies you can have peoples' heads blown off and bodies torn to pieces and still get a Pg-13 rating, but if you say the F word or show a breast it gets an R rating.<br />As far as the really negative reviews it seems as if people are madd at the movie and wrote reviews with a thesaurus and dictionary on hand to incorporate every large word into their review.  I think the movie was actually smart and the show smarter basically it makes fun of the close minded, judgemental, conservative, and uptight people in our society, by making them look bad by using a ridiculous character to bring out their ugly side.  In a way it's theraputic to see these people that judge everyone to be mocked i mean these are the everyday people not putting on blinkers in traffic, talking on the cell phones while driving and driving bad, people that work a register and dont say thank you or welcome, that push their views on other people, people that basically are oblivious to their surroundings but are able to annoy everyone else, where maybe sometimes ignorance is bliss but in the show and in this movie we get to laugh at them instead of honking our horns at them.<br />Anyway all and all the movie is fun, and it's clever however if you haven't bought anything yet try the complete series.<br />Thanks for reading.</p></body></html>

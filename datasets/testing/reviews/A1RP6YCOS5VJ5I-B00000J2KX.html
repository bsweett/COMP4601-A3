The obvious reasons for it being so good are because of the acting talents of Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall. Jack makes one creepy looking dad, even when he is sane. The script is just so well written and the actors do so well, how can you not be sucked into the movie? Being a Simpsons fan, I can't help but think of the parody they did of the movie years ago. This is just a classic film that may not be as scary as it once was, but it is still a great movie, and that will never change. Other remakes of the film have tried to capture the power of the original film, but nothing can touch this</p></body></html>

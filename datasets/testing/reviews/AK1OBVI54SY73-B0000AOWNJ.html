I don't hate it, but I can't say I really love it either. I own it, but only watch it like once every year just to get a good scare, but this movie does not offer too much else.<br /><br />It is scary, I'll give you that. The disturbing images and whatnot we have to see, then the story of the little girl is very successful at giving me chills at least. And the movie itself was something new and refreshing to see in the US theaters, among the other ho- hum horror films that continue to be popped out.<br /><br />But just because a film can give you chills, etc. doesn't mean it's necessarily fulfilling. The actors are just as plain as most horror actors are, the kid is yes annoying, and the ending itself leaves you in discontent. The story ended and I just was not satisfied the way a viewer should. Overall, I would recommend it, but I don't call it a favorite.<br /><br />3.5/5</p></body></html>

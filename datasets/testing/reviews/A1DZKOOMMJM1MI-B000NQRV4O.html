<meta name="summary" content="Take a Closer Look..."></head><body><p>Closer is an intimate look at two very complicated and very troubled relationships. A reviewer for TIME Magazine has called Closer "A love story for adults," but this is a far cry from any love story you are likely to see. If this is love, take back my reservation.<br /><br />Patrick Marber adapted his own play about two couples who try, unsuccessfully, to secretly swap partners. The film gets up close and personal with these four people with scenes that are so real and packed with so much emotion, you want to look away because they seem so private, yet you can't take your eyes off the screen.<br /><br />The cast is mesmerizing, each perfect in their roles. Julia Roberts is quite impressive as Anna, in one of her best performances. She is always easier to take when her trademark acting ticks are stripped away and she does a good job conveying a woman wracked with guilt who is nonetheless compelled to cause hurt. Jude Law is quite good as Dan, an obituary writer struggling to become a novelist, and Clive Owen is terrific in an Oscar nominated and Golden Globe winning role as Larry, a dermatologist who meets Anna because of a cruel joke by Dan. Natalie Portman, especially, delivers a nuanced and unforgettable performance in her Oscar nominated and Golden Globe winning performance. She was most stunning of all in her first 'adult' role. I look forward to seeing more of her once the horrendous first three Star Wars films come to an end in May.<br /><br />What makes Closer so interesting, aside from the across-the-board blistering performances and crackling dialogue, is that you might empathize with a character in one scene, and then hate their guts in the next. Everyone is a victim, and everyone is an abuser, although not always in the most obvious ways. Closer is very adult, and very clever; a classy, striking piece of work.<br /><br />Veteran director Mike Nichols' juggles the various time frames with consummate artistry and his subtle dramatic skill evokes memories of his first film, "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" (1966) - but there's no Elizabeth Taylor or Richard Burton here, although all four actors deliver unusually strong performances. You might feel the need for a cold shower after watching this film, but it'll be worth it.</p></body></html>

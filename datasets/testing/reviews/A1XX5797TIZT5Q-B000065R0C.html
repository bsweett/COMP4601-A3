Though  the division of the film is quite logical, the layout of the pages is quite  bad.  I also couldn't figure out how to turn off the commentary track after  turning it on, forcing me to take out the disc and restart the machine to  restore the original audio.<p>But now to the legions of good points.  The  commentaries by Tom Tykwer and Franka Potente are righteously involving,  both director and star eloquent and affectionate about the film.  (It's  especially amusing to note that they seem reluctant to acknowledge that  they are dating.)  The  technical details Tykwer offers are great for a  deeper understand of the execution, and their anecdotes are fun, well  phrased, and exciting.  Thumbs up to the commentary tracks.  There are also  biographies on each, subtitle options, and the picture quality is good  though, again, if you missed this in the theatres, you didn't quite get the  full impact of this movie.<p>Run Lola Run was an enjoyable experience for  me at the theatre and, much to my surprise, has grown on me since.  Potente's lead performance is Oscar-worthy, emotional at just the right  moments and comic and spunky at others.  Moritz Bleibtreu is wonderful as  the bumbling Manny, and the script is a great innovation.  The music-video  stylings sometimes detract from the story, but as a whole, it's like a  whole new way of seeing the world and, technical innovations aside, the  movie is fun, comedically superb, and involving on a human level, a rarity  for such a technically oriented film.</p></body></html>

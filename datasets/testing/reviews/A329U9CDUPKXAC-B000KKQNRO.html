<meta name="summary" content="Great but bad DVD translation"></head><body><p>I don't understand the controversy over this book/movie. I've seen entire TV specials on church channels where religious leaders and scholars work so hard to disprove this FICTIONAL story. I mean, it seems a bit ridiculous to me and makes me think that the church really does have something to hide. But conspiracies aside, I thought this was a very smart movie and I love adventures and clue solving. I'm giving it four stars because of the terrible DVD translation. Often times the characters wouldn't be speaking English so subtitles were needed but they put the subtitles so far down that, if you have a wide screen television like I do, they aren't visible unless you format your TV to where the picture is all squished. I wasn't at all pleased with that. But great movie.</p></body></html>

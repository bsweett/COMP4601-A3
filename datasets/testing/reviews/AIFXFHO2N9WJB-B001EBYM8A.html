The reason is because in a TV show the writer/director gets to spread his/her story over the course of multiple episodes or even an entire season.  In a movie you only get an average of 2 hours to get your story out, which can cause problems when adapting a television series, whether it be a long-running or short lived show, for theaters because you just don't have the luxury of time.  There have been some successful adaptations, "Starsky & Hutch", `Star Trek', `Mission: Impossible', and even `Charlie's Angels' (though I didn't care for either incarnation of the franchise), along with the success there have been those that failed "The Avengers" was lackluster, and "The Dukes of Hazzard" was the most recent, and possibly the worst adaptation I have seen in a long while.  In 1993, Warner Brothers felt the calling to try their collective hand at an adaptation, and their choice was the hit TV series "The Fugitive".  To assist in the success of their endeavor the WB enlisted top-notch, veteran acting talents Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, and hired director Andrew Davis hot off his highly successful submarine action film, "Under Siege".<br /><br />"The Fugitive" tells the story of Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), who after a charity event arrives home to find an intruder in his house and his wife murdered.  After fighting off the intruder, Kimble alerts the police, and upon their arrival Kimble is surprised by the fact that he is arrested for the murder of his own wife.  After being found guilty at his trial and sentenced to prison, the prison bus Kimble is being transported by crashes in front of an oncoming train.  After being freed by a correctional officer to assist with the other prisoners, Dr. Kimble flees in hopes of tracking down the one-armed murderer and proving his innocence.  However, hot on Richard's trail is a relentless U.S. Marshal, Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones), and his team of deputies, who will stop at nothing until their man is caught.  Let the chase begin!<br /><br />Clearly the executives at Warner Brothers made an excellent decision to make this adaptation, and managed to find the perfect cast, writer, and director to pull it off.  The cast, led by Harrison Ford (an actor that delivers a terrific performance every time) and Tommy Lee Jones (who was great in this role and was rewarded with the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), all give excellent performances, fleshing out each individual character and making the movie believable and real to the audience.  The story by David Twohy ("Pitch Black" and "The Chronicles of Riddick") is full of twists and turns, with riveting drama and action along with bits of comedy sprinkled about to lighten things up just a bit.  The direction of Andrew Davis, though not flashy by any means, delivers a very tight, well-paced manhunt movie that keeps the audience fully engrossed from start to finish, even though they already have a pretty good guess what the outcome will be, based on the source material.<br /><br />As I stated earlier some adaptations of TV shows to movies work out well and some don't, and the reasons generally stem from what I pointed out in the beginning of this review, but sometimes the results may vary depending on how committed to the project the cast/crew and the studio are.  It's nice to see that for "The Fugitive" all parties involved in the making of this picture gave their best, and the fruits of the labor paid off big time, making this movie one of the best TV series adaptations to ever be made.<br /><br />"The Fugitive" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.</p></body></html>

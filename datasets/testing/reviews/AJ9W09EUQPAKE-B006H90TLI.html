<meta name="summary" content="Slick with basic flaws"></head><body><p>The Big Lebowski was a movie with a plot riddled with more holes than a Swiss cheese and triumphed because of it. No Country for Old Men is let down by the same flaw. The good points about this movie - the brilliant ersatz 1980s New Mexico borderlands cinematography, the tough landscapes of badlands and small time dusty towns evoke the mood of the McCarthy novel brilliantly. And there are some fine acting performances, especially Javier Bardem as Shigurh, the psychopathic Hannibal Lecterish killer on the loose.<br /><br />But the plot. Jeez. What is going on here. Lazily constructed doesn't even start. From the start - who is the protagonist? The old timer sherrif with his riffs on the decline of the old moral certainties? Nope, because he doesn't solve anything during the movie and his character develops not one bit. Llwelyn Moss, retired welder who comes across a case of a million dollars after a shoot out? Nope, because his final denoument is conducted off scene. The killer, Shigurgh? He is a flat 2d psychopath. That is evidenced early in the movie and he progresses along that predictable trajectory.<br /><br />And the ending is such a let down. This is a slick, elegant, intellectual thriller that fails to paper over the serious flaws in its structure.</p></body></html>

I have seen the formula of interweaving reality with a fictional character before; one of the most famous is "Sophie's World" by Jostein Gaarder.<br /><br />Any way the basic story is of a child that loses his father and thinks that his father left him a message that will change his life. In the process of perusing the message he meets Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s who may just have a message to change the reader's life.<br /><br />The book incorporated a lot of pictures to help tell the story. This is innovative and holds your attention. However it did not translate well into the film as the film was slow and dragged a lot in scenes and even dialog.  They lost the continuity and purpose of the story by incorporating the station inspector story that was a minor part of the book. It was too slapstick.  What was great graphics in the book translated in almost cartoonish graphics in the film.  However they did an excellent presentation of how the original films were designed to show us the stuff that dreams were made of.<br /><br />The flat screen version was well enough. The 3D graphics were sort of gimmicky sort of looking through a stereoscope; however they were several fields deep.<br /><br />So we have some unnecessary story added and some slow dragging parts but in the end the feel of the original book shines through.</p></body></html>

First of all, I can see why this picture wasn't nominated for an Oscar in the best picture category. And who said Jennifer Hudson could act, she would have never gotten the role of Elfie if it wasn't for American Idol. Hudson's acting so self-righteous and wooden, please tell how she won the Academy Award. Eddie Murphy can't sing and Beyonce looks like she doesn't know what's going on half the time, this film is pretty bad. I was expecting some great Broadway tunes but they are completely awful. The song, Cadillac is embarrassing and ridiculous. Stay away from Dreamgirls, such a pointless and idiotic musical. If you want to see a great musical then check-out  Grease, A Chorus Line, and Chicago.</p></body></html>

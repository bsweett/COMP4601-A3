Lee, the New York city icon, used panoramic camera angles in depicting his adopted home town, particularly the Wall Street area, as a backdrop for this drama.  Lee made effective use of flashforwards in presenting the plot, a cleverly contrived bank robbery that quickly spiraled into a hostage taking standoff.<br /><br />Criminal mastermind Dalton Russell played by Clive Owen led a well trained team into a Manhattan bank where they quickly assumed control.  Forcing the large group of hostages to strip and dress in the same outfits as the robbers, he homogenized the confined group.  Hostage negotiating NYPD detective Keith Frazier played by talented Denzel Washington, a cool cerebral yet compromised investigator owing to a recent bust that went bad, wall called in to deal with Owen.<br /><br />The bank was owned by Jewish chairman of the board Arthur Case played by veteran Christopher Plummer.  Plummer was prepared to go to great lengths to maintain secrecy of his affairs which were documented within a safety deposit box located at the bank.  Plummer had been a Nazi collaborator against his own people harvesting untold riches which he used to start his banking empire.  As a result, Plummer called in smug and refined power broker Madeleine White played by Jodie Foster to help maintain secrecy while she negotiated with Owen.<br /><br />We soon see that there is an ulterior motive to the affair as Owen appears to be stalling for time.  Washington realizes that things are amiss but is shackled from pursuing his investigation by higher ups.<br /><br />The movie concludes with an unexpected interaction between Washington and Owen highlighting the mutual respect each man had for the other.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pretty pictures, great execution, no emotions"></head><body><p>Very atmospheric. Great lighting, shots, locations. Script/directing didn't made me care one way or another for the characters. If you don't care for them, hate them, or want to root for a character, or feel protective of them, want love to blossom, to savor bitter revenge on those that deserve it...it's just an unenvolving ride. Any emotions in this film just lay flat. We should be afraid of the Wolfman, but leavened with pity...as he is an innocent victem. Things happen, and I feel barely a nudge in the storytellers craft to get us involved. It's a handsome film, well made, but doesn't draw you in.</p></body></html>

Did you ever have that thought in the back of your mind of just what kind of people you are going to encounter?  If you have, you will know the chill factor in &quot;Wrong Turn.&quot;<br />Taking place in West Virginia, a young man takes a wrong turn.<br />Driving down a desolate road he runs right into another car filled with more young people, and the show begins.<br />Inbred Mountain Cannibal men are licking their chops as they see breakfast, lunch and dinner before them. Gross!<br />This movie has many heart stopping moments, lots of gore and was fast paced.  I think what troubled me the most is the fact that we do not know who lives in all these little tucked away areas of our land now do we? Remember that next time you travel, it could stop you from being someone's dinner!  A movie all horror fans will enjoy!</p></body></html>

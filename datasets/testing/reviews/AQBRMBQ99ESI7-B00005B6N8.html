No such luck. This one does, however, make more sense by itself.<br /><br />The premise is of a crash landing on a forbidding planet. One of those to survive is an escaped convict with a bounty. The trouble is that the local wildlife is not very friendly and seems to take a positive delight in turning survivors into casualties. They appear to be large creatures, somewhat reminiscent of bats, vampire tendencies and an aversion to light and human beings. That is where Riddick comes in handy since he is decidedly unhealthy to the "bats".<br /><br />The story was fairly predictable but done well enough. I did not think it was great but it apparently appeals to some. Don't expect it to be a great setup for the sequel, though.</p></body></html>

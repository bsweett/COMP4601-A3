Although not as high in the suspense aspect, like Leonard Nimoy says, it was good to lighten up a bit and have a good time with Star Trek.  While other reviewers might feel the humurous aspects of this film wearout after repeated viewings. I understand that statement, but don't feel the same.  I can still get a laugh out of these scenes even though I've seen them more times than I can remember.  I especially love the scene with Scotty being handed a mouse and him trying to talk to it.  Again, one of the best Star Trek films out of the original six.  If you're one of the few people who've not seen this or are new to the genre, I definitely suggest you add this DVD to your collection.</p></body></html>

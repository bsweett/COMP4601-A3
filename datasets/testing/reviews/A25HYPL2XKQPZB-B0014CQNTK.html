I never once laughed out loud yet found the story of the pregnant teenage girl looking for a home for her baby to be perfectly enjoyable. This movie generated a lot of buzz and did quite well at the box office. I don't know if it ranks as one of the best pictures of the year (it was much better than Michael Clayton), but this is a fun movie that you should check out. Due to language and adult themes, it probably isn't for young kids.<br /><br />Juno is played by Ellen Page. Page is perfect as the 16-year old junior stunned by the shocking news she is pregnant. Juno is witty, sarcastic, extremely intelligent and passionate about life. She is also very vulnerable, and it shows during the times that her plans don't work out. Like getting pregnant, for example. She tries to deal with it on her own and seeks out a family planning center that doesn't require parental consent. Abortion is a controversial issue, but in a teen pregnancy movie, it had to be dealt with. The movie deals with it and gets it out of the way as quickly as possible. With the help of the one friend that sticks with her, Juno plans to find a couple to adopt her baby. She believes she has found the perfect couple in Vanessa and Mark Loring (played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman). Vanessa longs to have kids, but can't, and Mark is very laid back and at times more interested in classic rockn'roll. This is a strange couple and some of the best scenes are between Page and Bateman.<br /><br />The movie is backed by a great soundtrack. Diablo Cody's screenplay keeps you tuned to the screen. Juno's dad, played by JK Simmons, is very supportive of his daughter. Michael Cera plays the father of the child, Beeker. He loves Juno, but their relationship changes because of the pregnancy. Because the issue of teen pregnancy is somewhat idealized, this movie is sort of a fairy tale. Still, I really liked this movie. Finally, an oscar nominee that wasn't too pretentious for regular movie goers to enjoy.</p></body></html>

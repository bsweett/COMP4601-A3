<meta name="summary" content="Good story, well told.  Rises above the action film genre."></head><body><p>This thriller was written and directed by David Mamet which makes it rise above the genre in respect to dialog and plot.  It's tightly written and well acted with constant twists and turns.  There's violence too.  But this is a good story, well told.  Val Kilmer stars and all the actors do well. Of course it's not believable but it did hold my interest.  And the plot is as fresh as today's headlines involving the FBI, CIA, Secret Service and the White House.  There are also some Middle Eastern kidnappers and a satisfying positive conclusion.  It's put together in a tight package and will appeal to action/adventure fans or anyone else just needing a fast paced film for a bit of escape.</p></body></html>

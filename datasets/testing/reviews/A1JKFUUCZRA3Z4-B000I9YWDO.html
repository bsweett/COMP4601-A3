<meta name="summary" content="A movie you laugh at because if you didn't, you'd cry"></head><body><p>If you ever felt like your cubicle walls resembled a coffin, this movie is for you.<br /><br />Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) is an office worker who feels trapped in a soulless job performing endless mind-numbing tasks.  This 30-something worker is panicking that he could still be working this job when he's  50.<br />When he turns to his fellow co-workers for validation, they give him the standard response that he should be happy to have that kind of security.<br /><br />At the urging of his girlfriend, Peter sees a hypnotist to relax.  During the hypnotherapy session, however, the hypnotist dies before he can wake Peter up.  So then, a hypnotized and overly relaxed Peter goes to work and starts telling everyone how he really feels about his job...and TBS reports.<br />The things he says and does while under hypnosis are hilarious.  I especially like the line, "It's not that I'm lazy, it's that I just don't care."<br /><br />As a cubicle dweller myself, I could relate to many moments in this film like having to report to numerous supervisors, supervisors who fuss over the smallest detail, supervisors who don't listen and talk over you, Hawaiian Fridays to boost morale (especially funny since it's announced right after introducing the man who could fire any of them), as well as the scene where Peter and his co-workers beat the crap out of a printer.  Who hasn't wanted to do that?<br /><br />I found myself relating a little too well to Peter's situation...so much so that if I didn't laugh, I'd probably cry.<br /><br />Peter isn't the only funny character in this movie either.  I also liked Peter's co-worker Michael Bolton ("Why should I change my name? He's the one who sucks"), Peter's co-worker who makes the "Oh" face, Peter's neighbor who says he'd have two women at once if he were a millionaire, Peter's girlfriend who's forced to wear buttons of flair and deal with a boss who wants her to read his mind, and of course, Lundberg who ever so casually asks Peter if he can work Saturday aaaaand Sunday.  Thaaaanks.<br /><br />Overall, a hilarious movie if you've ever felt like the only human working in zombieland.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A lot Better Than The Ring"></head><body><p>From all the hype I've been hearing since it's release, I would have thought that this was going to be a horrible movie, and I was wrong. This movie isn't half as bad as the majority lead some to believe.<br /><br />The plot was fascinating, even if it is just another haunted house story, it is probably the best haunted house story I have seen and I have seen a lot. I wouldn't go as far as to say that this movie is scary, I didn't think so, but that doesn't mean it wasn't good.<br /><br />I was very surprised on how well Sarah Michelle Gellar did in her role. Very shocked, I thought that this was just going to be another teen horror flick but it was surprisngly fun. It has taken me this long since it's release to watch the movie and I have to say that I wasn't disappointed in what I saw. And after watching the American version of the Ring, I thought I would be.<br /><br />So the moral of the story is that if you are afraid that this movie is going to suck, take a chance and at least watch it when it comes on TV. You may be surprised, just as I was, and end up liking. It taking place in Japan was an added plus. The only flaw was that this was like a Tarantino film, ie, this has flashbacks with no warning given.<br /><br />Overall, good film that should be given a chance, this is not your average teen flick, very mature.</p></body></html>

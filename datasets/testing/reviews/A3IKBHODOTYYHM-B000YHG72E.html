<meta name="summary" content="Ferrell fits the role for this Christmas tale"></head><body><p>Liberties can be taken when it comes to some holiday movies, and Elf is also one that fits this niche, as Will Ferrell plays a human who mistakenly was left abandoned and wound up being raised by Papa Elf and his group of elves. Trying to fit into the elf world, Buddy (Ferrell) helps his fellow elves prepare gifts for Christmas and do other sorts of jobs, but never quite holds up his end (at one point, after not meaning his quota, Buddy frustratingly calls himself a "cotton-headed ninnymuggins" in despair). One day, after overhearing other elves speak about Buddy's "humanness", Buddy has the truth broken to him by Papa Elf: he was adopted by the elf community, and he's really human, and his father, who is on the naughty list, is in New York where he works. Buddy departs to New York to find his real father, and tries to understand and fit into the culture of the human world as Christmas approaches. Buddy's father is play perfectly by James Caan, who is aloof and distant from Buddy. While in a department store, Buddy meets a beautiful worker who he falls for. From here, the film focuses on Buddy trying to gain a role in his human father's life as well as his new found relationship with his fellow worker, all the while trying to stir up Christmas spirit in a world where it is sorely lacking.<br /><br />The casting for Elf is superb. Ferrell can use his zany and over-the-top antics, and it fits well with his character Buddy as he makes his transition to the human world as a giant elf. He plays the role as "man-child" with perfection, and his obnoxious and overly loud outbursts go well with the inner child and innocence in this role. There is also great chemistry between Ferrell and Deschanel, who is the department store clerk who Buddy falls for. There are a few parts where they sing, and Deschanel has a wonderful voice, with Ferrell's not being too bad either. James Caan does a great job and is cast perfectly as Buddy's reluctant and tough-guy father, who at first wants nothing to do with Buddy, but eventually softens. And Bob Newhart is solid as Papa Elf, who raises Buddy to be more elf than human.<br /><br />There are some great laughs in the film as well as a few memorable lines. At one point, Buddy overhears that Santa is coming to the department store the next day and he screams out "Santa!" When the "phony" Santa arrives, Buddy sniffs out that this is, in fact, a fake and is on to him, saying "You sit on a throne of lies", which follows with a major altercation between the two.<br /><br />The nice thing about this film is that it is a family friendly Christmas film with humor and a feel good attitude. The latter part of the film probably isn't as good as the first half, and we can probably predict how things will turn out, but that doesn't deter an over all good time.</p></body></html>

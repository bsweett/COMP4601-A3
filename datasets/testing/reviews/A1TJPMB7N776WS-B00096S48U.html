<meta name="summary" content="Demon-Boi"></head><body><p>Beautifully photographed, produced and designed with an artistic eye, this new version of "The Omen" saga, though scarier than the original, is not a  success though Liev Schreiber's Robert Thorn,  the excellent as usual David Thewlis as photographer/reporter David Jennings and the formidable Mia Farrow as Mrs. Baylock do their level best to add class and sophistication to the proceedings.<br />The basic story is that the anti-Christ (a dull, Seamus-Davey Fitzpatrick) is back on Earth and looking to take it back for the devil. There is the requisite mumbo jumbo, garroting, beheading and such: most of it done on a very high level of ingenuity and gut-level, sickening brutality.<br />Acting wise the main problems are the limp, emotionless, icy Katherine Thorn of Julia Stiles and the seemingly clueless, poorly directed and woefully miscast anti-Christ Damien of Fitzpatrick. And when the child of the Devil is boring in a film about itself, what have we got?</p></body></html>

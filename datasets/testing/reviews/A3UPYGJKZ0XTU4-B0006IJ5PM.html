A Great Sports Film with Wide Appeal."></head><body><p>"Friday Night Lights" is based on the acclaimed book "Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream" by H.G. Bissinger, who happens to be director Peter Berg's cousin. In 1988, Bissinger followed the Permian Panthers, a high school football team and pride of the West Texas town of Odessa, through a tough season on and off the field. The citizens of Odessa hang their hopes and identity on their football team. Many men of the older generations wear State Championship rings that symbolize their lives' greatest accomplishment. The young Panthers are treated as celebrities. And they are expected to win. "Friday Night Lights" focuses on three young men: The reserved, anxious quarterback, Mike Winchell (Lucas Black), who must lead the team through tough times and take care of his needy mother. Cocky "Boobie" Miles (Derek Luke), the team's star running back and NFL hopeful. And Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund), a  running back with fumbling problems, whose alcoholic father (Tim McGraw), a former player himself, berates him for every small failure. The coach who is expected in no uncertain terms to lead the team to the State Championship was Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton), a man who is reserved off the field, intense on it, and whose every decision is scrutinized by townspeople fixated on their team.<br /><br />"Friday Night Lights" will be remembered as one of the great sports movies. For football fans, it's a joy to watch. The Permian Panther's remarkable 1988 season exemplifies the excitement, the commitment, the pain, the thrills, and the anguish that make sports a universal attraction, if not an obsession. Emotionally captivating portrayals of the players suck the audience in. Billy Bob Thornton does a fantastic job of communicating consistently complex emotions in a man who speaks very little. The film's final game is one of the most riveting I've seen in a movie. According to director Peter Berg, 95% of the film was shot handheld, but the camera does not shake inappropriately. The candid depiction of characters at a significant time in their lives, the relationship of the town to the team, and the nail-biting suspense brought on by possibility of great success or equally great failure makes "Friday Night Lights" a wonderfully entertaining story with near-universal appeal. A truly terrific sports movie -not only for sports fans.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include 4 featurettes, an audio commentary, deleted scenes, text bios of the cast and filmmakers, and a DVD-ROM (Windows only). "Peter Berg Discusses a Scene in the Movie" is a short intro to the scene in the burger joint, which was filmed at the recommendation of the studio who wisely felt that Berg needed something to slow down the frenetic first half-hour of the film. The intro is followed by the scene. "Player Cam" (4 minutes) is a home movie of the actors goofing off. In "Tim McGraw: Off the Stage" (6 minutes), McGraw, director Peter Berg, and producer Brian Grazier talk about the country music star's role as Don's father, Charlie Billingsley. "The Story of the 1988 Permian Panthers" (23 minutes) is a documentary  in which the real Boobie Miles, Don Billingsley, Mike Winchell, and Brian Chavez talk about their experiences as Panthers in 1988. Director Peter Berg and writer H.G. Bissinger also discuss the characters. The audio commentary by director Peter Berg and H.G. Bissinger addresses technical aspects of filming, the story behind the movie, and the characters. Bissinger recalls being there and witnessing the events in 1988, and he tells us which scenes are fiction created for dramatic purposes. Subtitles for the film are available in Spanish and French. Captioning is available in English. Dubbing is available in Spanish and French.</p></body></html>

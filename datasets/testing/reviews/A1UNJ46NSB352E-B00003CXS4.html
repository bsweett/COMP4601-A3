<meta name="summary" content="Get this DVD!"></head><body><p>If you are a fan of Get Shorty, Pulp Fiction, or other crime-caper comedies, get this movie.  It is hilarious, it is entertaining, it is awesome.  All the performances are good, from Brad Pitt's accent, to Denis Farina being himself, to Vinnie Jones' tough guy.  This movie is good from start to finish.  This is a solid DVD as well.  I listened to the Dolby Digital track and the sound was near perfect.  The picture is very, very clear.  And the second disc is loaded with special features, including some interesting deleted scenes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="STILL 'PRACTICALLY PERFECT IN EVERY WAY'"></head><body><p>Forty years old and still practically perfect in every way! Even at 2hr.s, 20 min. "Mary Poppins" remains Walt Disney's crowning technical and artistic achievement; an effervescent eclectic blend of animation/live action and special effects that idyllically encompasses P.L Travers' enchanting best seller. Julie Andrews' London stage performance in `Camelot' so impressed Disney that he immediately began talks to secure her talents for his film. By the time shooting began, Andrews was playing Eliza on stage in `My Fair Lady'. That she was casually looked over for the lead in the film version of that play remains a mystery. But Lady's loss was Poppin's gain.<br /><br />Andrews delights in the title role as the too good to be true nanny with just enough playful larceny lurking beneath her properly quaffed locks and bonnet. She arrives to take charge of the Bank's household and whip them into shape; wife Winifred (Glynis John), husband George (David Tomlinson) and their two children, Michael (Matthew Garber) and Jane (Karen Dotrice). Seems Jane and Michael have been giving the previous nannies a hard time. Actually, they're just a pair of lonely kids who desire the love and attention of their stoic dad. A lowly chimney sweep, Bert (Dick Van Dyke) helps provide Mary and the children with one of those supercalafragalisticexpialadocious bits of escapism set to magic; a fantastic frolic in the country complete with carousel ride, fox hunt and horse races. Yikes, tally-ho! There's so much to admire and celebrate in this perennial classic that it's best left to the home viewer to pop this one in for a jolly holiday of a good time!<br /><br />Disney's deluxe, 2-disc DVD is a genuine treat. At long last, anamorphically enhanced for widescreen televisions, the transfer is generally quite smooth and solid for image quality that will surely please. Colors are rich and vibrant. Blacks are solid and deep. Whites are generally clean. Occasionally there is a hint of age related artifacts as well as some minor pixelization that breaks apart some of the background information, but these distractions are kept to a bare minimum. The audio is a brand new, and very engaging, 5.1 mix for the home theatre aficionado. Extras include the all new 50 min. documentary on the making of the film that is quite comprehensive. There's also some self congratulatory audio commentaries and `A Musical Journey' with composer, Richard Sherman. The rest of the extras are typical Disney catering to the tot's fanfare; a trivia game, special effects junket and some music video and short subject stuff. All in all this is a very nicely packed special edition from the Disney stable and one that's been long overdo. So get out your umbrella or go fly a kite; because "Mary Poppins" is shear magic for the young and young at heart!</p></body></html>

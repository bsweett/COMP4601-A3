<meta name="summary" content="I DID NOT like this movie."></head><body><p>A friend of mine recommened this to me, and we watched it earlier today. I hated this movie. The acting was bad, the plot was barely there, and the writing was HORRIBLE. I understand that this was a throwback to old horror movies from the seventies, but if you're gonna do it, do it right. It had one or two funny and/or disturbing scenes in it, but for the most part, it sucked. I didn't like the use of satanic rituals in this movie. It really bothered me, and I know that the scene was probably meant to do that, but still. If you're the kind of person who is sensitive to that type of material, then stay away from this film. I have my reasons for feeling the way that I do about that. <p>This could have been a fun movie, and I was a bit disappointed. I wasn't expecting much in the first place, but I wanted it to be amusing at best. Like I said, there were a few good moments in it, but not enough to waste an hour and fifteen minutes of your life on. <p>SKIP IT.</p></body></html>

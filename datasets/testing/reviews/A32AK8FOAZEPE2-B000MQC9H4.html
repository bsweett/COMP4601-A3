<meta name="summary" content="a hollow, cliched, marginally watchable movie"></head><body><p>jack black was an out-of-place miscast. he acted very badly in this movie. maybe because before this movie, he never seriously played a romantic figure. it resulted him acting so poorly just with his comic funny pretentious facial movements. the californian part in this movie was weaker than the part in england. contrite, cliched and boring, like watching a goodwill charity show. assisting the old screenwriter part was like watching social security's program to fill up an hollow and empty storyline. there's no way to imagine the english woman would have possibly fall for that comedian-like guy. there's no chemistry at all between them, both just acting dutifully to fulfill the mismatched cast. kate winslet obviously felt jack black's embarrassing miscast and showed some struggles to follow the script. she tried so hard to perform a role out of a bad script. i too, felt embarrassed every time when she got to play out the scenes with jack black. the scene shot in the blockbuster was such a stupid and totally unnecessary part that should be deleted.<br /><br />the reason why i decided to watch this movie was because i just curiously wondered why with such  strong cast, the general movie critics still thought it sucked big time. but then i totally understood why it's just marginally watchable. this is a very unbalanced movie with two strong & weak parts, further weakened by overly long blahblahblah script and the jack black miscast. a movie that would be only possible for you to sit through in x'mas.</p></body></html>

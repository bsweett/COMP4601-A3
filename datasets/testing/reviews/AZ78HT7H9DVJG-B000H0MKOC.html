<meta name="summary" content="a surprise of a movie..."></head><body><p>For some reason, I thought that *Thank You for Smoking* was a documentary.  I don't know what led me to assume that.  So, it was a surprise for me, both in genre and the story.<br /><br />Nick Naylor is a spinner of a spokesperson for the tobacco industry.  He's so savvy with words that he could convince anyone that smoking is actually good for you.  Even if he doesn't necessarily believe it himself.<br /><br />Nick has everything going smoothly for him.  He meets once a week with 2 other lobbyists (guns and alcohol).  They call themselves "the MOD" (Merchants of Death).  He isn't afraid of his boss because he knows that THE man of tobacco (Duvall) has his back.  He's off to Hollywood to get cigarette smoking back on screen.<br /><br />The governor of Vermont (Macy) wants a televised political debate with him.  However, he needs leverage.  Unknown to the governor, a reporter (Holmes) wants to do an article on Naylor.  Drawn to her charm, wits and sexiness, he spills the beans to her.  Well...as long as he is getting a "side dish".  Of course, the reporter has an ulterior motive, which is to expose Naylor as who he really is.<br /><br />Predictably, things spiral down as soon as the article is released which contains secrets and identities of those behind the tobacco industry.  The governor just cannot wait to debate with Naylor as well as making him look like a fool.<br /><br />Can Naylor turn things around and save face as well as the tobacco industry?  Has the provobial cat gotten his tongue?<br /><br />I like *Thank You for Smoking* because it was stimulating for discussion with friends after the movie.  It just makes you wonder who is lobbying and are they lobbying for you or not.  In addition, you'll soon realize the looming and eminent presence of the tobacco industry in America.</p></body></html>

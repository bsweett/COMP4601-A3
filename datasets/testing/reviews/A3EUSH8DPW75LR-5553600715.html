<meta name="summary" content="Amazing on blu ray"></head><body><p>THE OTHERS is a classic film.  It is superbly written, directed and most importantly acted.  Nicole Kidman radiates in one of her finest performances and carries this film on her shoulders from beginning to end.  And this film has no gimmicks or over the top special effects.  It is a true ghost story and a very intelligent one at that.  If you are reading this you are probably already a fan of the film.  But how is it on blu ray.  Blu ray when used correctly can highly raise the bar of presentation on a film.  One would assume THE OTHERS might present a challenge for it is a dark film shot mostly in shadows and fog.  But the video presentation on the blu ray here does an amazing job.  The present graininess is original to the film and the atmospeheric fog and shadows take on new life while characters appear clearly throughout. Characters and scenery show through strong and clear with very strong clarity and crispness and skin tones are very realistic.  Colors are otherwise subdued for they are meant to be but the whole picture manages to shine levels above the dvd.  With this superb video we get an even better audio presentation.  The DTS HD Master 5.1 audio is superb.  This is mostly a dialogue driven film but there is beautiful soundtrack music and this is indeed a ghost story.  And what we get is very strong and present dialogue with surround sounds that come to dynamic life with the scares and chills and thrills.  This is indeed a haunting film and the audio presentation puts blu ray to great use.  Your whole speaker system will come to life and have you jumping out of your skin at all the right places.<br /><br />This classic film gets the treatment it deserves on blu ray.  THE OTHERS is a film so intricate and detailed that multiple viewings will strongly be desired and the blu ray presentation will make each viewing that much better.  Every excellent thing about this film is made that much better on blu ray.  I highly recommend this film.  And if you already own the dvd give yourself a treat and get the blu ray.  This is an example of blu ray put to its best use.</p></body></html>

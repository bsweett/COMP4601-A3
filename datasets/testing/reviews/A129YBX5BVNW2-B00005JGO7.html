It's clever, it's ballsy and it's just so ludicrously entertaining. But most of all - it's easily the funniest film I've seen in years. I mean when you're not laughing out loud (for all the wrong reasons of course), you're sat there giggling like a fool most of the time.<br /><br />Writing wise too - "Snatch" is kicking like a mule, it's confident and beautifully constructed. It feels like a sort of updated modern-day Ealing Comedy - so good and so irresistibly English. I'm reminded a lot of the 1969 original of "The Italian Job" - another gem on BLU RAY (see review) that works its way into your heart and stays there. This is seriously impressive stuff - and especially as it was only Guy Ritchie's second movie.<br /><br />But the really great news for fans and newcomers alike is the PRINT; it's RESTORED - and for about 95% of the time it looks immaculate in every frame. Very occasionally there's some blurring, maybe a few lines, but that's just the rough and tumble way it was filmed I suspect - and those shots as I say are very, very few indeed. Most of the time, it's looks fantastic and the clean up also seems to have brought the film so much more to life...it's a real pleasure to watch.<br /><br />The extras are there too, which is great - and it's very reasonably priced.<br /><br />You also forget about the sheer size and quality of the cast - Benicio Del Toro as the mumbling gambler Frankie Four-Fingers - Alan Ford as the fantastically crass and violent Brick Top - Rade Shelbedgia as the unkillable Russian Boris The Blade - Vinnie Jones as the man hunter Bullet-Tooth Tony - Dennis Farina as the Jewish American Diamond broker Avi, Mike Reid as his English equivalent Doug The Head - the gormless trio of Post Office robbers, Lennie James, Robbie Gee and Ade - Stephen Graham as the hapless sidekick Tommy who thinks too much about dairy products and what they do to the digestive system - and of course, the movie's trump cards - the pairing of Jason Stratham as Turkish and Brad Pitt as Mickey the bare-knuckle Irish boxing champion. Great stuff. Throw in hip music, choppy editing, apt locations and a dictionary of slang to work out what everyone is saying - and it's as chipper as a bulldog who's just swallowed a squeaky toy...<br /><br />Having recently seen "Sherlock Holmes" at the cinema (and been seriously impressed too), I can feel the need for a Guy Ritchie spending purge coming on...<br /><br />"Snatch" on BLU RAY is brilliant fun - a winner to look at - and reasonably priced too.<br /><br />Way to go guys.  Recommended - big time.<br /><br />PS: see also my review for "Rock n Rolla" on BLU RAY...</p></body></html>

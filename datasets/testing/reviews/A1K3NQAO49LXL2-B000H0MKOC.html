<meta name="summary" content="Hypocritical"></head><body><p>Clever tale of libertarianism from Peter Thiel, the PayPal guy.  In the story, our hero Aaron Eckhart lives a lie so that he can pay his mortgage, he goes through a series of challenges, and comes out on top the way you'd see in any Tom Cruise movie, the main difference is that this one happens to be starring Aaron Eckhart instead of Mr Couch Jumper.<br /><br />Sure, it seems to be a thinking man's movie, but why would a movie about smoking not show anybody smoking?  Why would a movie about the right of the tabacco industry to exist suppress smoking in it?  Why would a movie that shows the main character going to Hollywood to convince studio executives to feature its stars lighting up, but then not have its star light up?  Somehow the film, while enjoyable, is not clever enough to answer any of these questions. Rob Lowe is good as a serene Hollywood guru-type, but William H. Macy horribly typecast as a snivelling senator who is exposed with ridiculous ease as a hypocrite.</p></body></html>

Jennifer Connelly stars as a mother that moves into a apartment that is haunted by little girl that ends up dying in a huge water tank on top of a roof of a apartment complex!!!!!!!! I thought that this movie had a great plot and i liked the storyline!!!!!! A lot of people said that this movie sucked and had no story.... So if you like supernatural thrillers then check this movie out!!!!!!</p></body></html>

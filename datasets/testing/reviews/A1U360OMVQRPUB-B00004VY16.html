<meta name="summary" content="Absolutely Phenomenal On HD DVD"></head><body><p>Everyone knows the plot of the movie and that it was based on the 1940s film, "The Mummy's Hand," so what I'm going to talk about is the HD DVD transfer.<br /><br />I got my HD DVD player last year and have been thoroughly stoked about it, given the right movie.  "The Mummy" is definitely one of those right movies.  From the opening credits to the first views of the Egyptian city, the clarity of the high-def presentation rivals that of your local theater.  Once a wall-sized monitor becomes available, film buffs are truly going to be able to have the theater experience right in their own homes.<br /><br />The action sequences are great.  The colors are fantastic.  And the special effects are tremendous.  The dust cloud confrontation at the end just blew me away all over again.<br /><br />I owned the movie on DVD and had watched it on television a few times (it's one of those on a list of guilty pleasures) but I hadn't seen anything like this presentation outside of the theater.<br /><br />Now I gotta get "The Mummy Returns" and "The Scorpion King."  And I can't wait for "The Mummy 3" coming in 2008!</p></body></html>

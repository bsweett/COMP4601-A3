It covers a 40 day period prior to the invasion of US troops on Iwa Jima and the events that occur immediately after. Filmed in sepia tones that are highlighted for fiery explosions, the limited color range made the action more terrible and the drama more heightened.<br /><br />Two officers lead the Japanese men on Iwo Jima, General Kuribayashi and Baron Nishi. The General is played to perfection by Ken Watanabe and the Baron is played with great zeal by Tshuyoshi Ihara. These two men are very worldly and sophisticated, both having lived in the USA. Whereas they are totally loyal to the Emperor and the cult of militarism that dominated Japan during World War II, they also are keenly aware that the Americans are not cowards and fools and that the fight for Iwa Jima will be a living hell. General Kuribayashi takes over command from Admiral Ohsugi, a conservative by-the-book mediocre military man. When General Kuribayashi's assessments are contrary to Admiral Ohsugi's we begin to see professional jealousies arise, ending with the Admiral leaving the island. General Kuribayashi found a situation where he was originally thought he had bombers and ships only to find he really had none. The island had very little fresh water, an insignificant amount in regard to the needs of a military campaign.<br /><br />The middle ranking officers were certainly interesting in the film. Many of them regarded General Kuribayashi and Baron Nishi as American sympathizers and in some cases disobeyed orders.  However these same fellows were also inclined to shot or behead the front line soldiers under their command when they thought that their orders were ignored or undermined or when they suspected retreat. There were repeated examples of how devotion to military authoritarianism combined with draconian rule enforcement is a dangerous combination for small minds.<br /><br />The front line soldiers were certainly sympathetic and were the heart of the movie. Kazunari Ninomiya played the baker Saigo perfectly.  He is the everyman figure, the lone survivor, the common man that survives despite all the odds against him. The film follows his 40 days as he sees a close friend die of bloody dysentery, as he runs from pillar to post avoiding death as the American's gradually overtake the entire island. He is joined by a young man that he first thinks is a spy for the secret police only to find later that this man has been disgraced for failure to follow an idiotic order from a superior officer.<br /><br />The Japanese faced amazing odds. Over a 40 day period they suffered over 22,000 casualties until only 216 remained. The empire was crumbling and reinforcements and supplies never came. Hiroshi Wantanabe played the loyal Lieutenant Fujita, aide to the General, who had to repeatedly bear bad news to the General who was plotting how to make the best of an impossible situation.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood produced a highly entertaining film here. The film is thoughtful and intellectual as it opens our eyes to Japanese culture of the time and the influence on the soldiers and officers. The film also explored empathy as we see several scenes where a top officer, Baron Nishi, converse with a wounded American solder. The Japanese were humanized in the film. They were never made to appear innocent of wartime crimes committed in China and elsewhere. Rather, we were given a balanced vision and insight into the Japanese military culture that fanned the war and the broad range of men and ethics and intelligence levels that interacted in this military-social system. We may not understand fully the authoritarian dictatorial leadership social structure that was the Japanese military norm, but we can see its negative effects on common men with common sense who could not question authority due to rigid social norms.<br /><br />Overall this is a thoughtful and moving and artistic entertainment experience of a high order.</p></body></html>

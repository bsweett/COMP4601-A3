<meta name="summary" content="Hilarious and heart-broken at the same time. Abigail Breslin's so cute, lovely, and innocently funny. It got 2 Oscars in 2007."></head><body><p>It contains good dark humour. It won't appeal to many people. Many scenes made me laugh and broke my heart at the same time. It's not suitable for children because of foul language, dirty jokes, and drug scenes.<br /><br />**** SPOILER. DO NOT READ THIS if you HAVE NOT WATCHED the MOVIE.<br /><br />For example, in the scene where the grandpa died in the hospital. The lady in charge of the corpse yelled at Greg Kinnear (the father) when he wanted to pospone the burial. She did not want to listen to his explanation why. It brillantly portraited how cruelly sometimes people treated each other. It moved me.<br /><br />The next scene is hilarious when it showed the family trying to sneak the corpse into their car to continue  their trip to California.<br /><br />The most moving scene was when Abigail walked to her brother who was extremely depressed and sitting on the ground. She then sat down beside him, saying nothing, just leanning on him.<br /><br />In the last scene, the director cleverly took aim at child-beauty-pageant industry. My stomach hurt when I saw kids from<br />5-7 years old in heavy makeup did their catwalk. Adults were exploiting kids for their profit and pleasure!<br /><br />Abigail Breslin was the best actress here. She's so cute, lovely, and innocently funny. She's naturally beautiful without any makeup. Yes, her dance was meant for adults. But in my opinion, it's acceptable and funny. Why was it okay for adults to exploit kids but it's not okay for kids to dance like adults?<br /><br />No wonder it got 2 Oscars in 2007. One was given to Michael Arndt for original screenplay. The other was given to Alan Arkin for best supporting actor.</p></body></html>

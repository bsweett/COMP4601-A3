<meta name="summary" content="I hate Kevin Costne...wait, what?"></head><body><p>I hate Kevin Costner. I hated his smug romance-figure status from the 90's; I hated his arrogance and his acting and his hair and all of his movies post-Dancing with Wolves. This made me doubtful about watching this movie, despite my general liking for clever murder in the movies. So it took em a good long while to get this movie, and then another long period of looking at it doubtfully every time I walked past my DVD's before I actually got bored enough to put it in.<br /><br />And it was fantastic. There's only one real flaw, and that's the loose end of his daughter; it's not a bad plot device but they leave it hanging there like an Irish pennant on a fine suit. It begs for a sequel which will never occur.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is wonderful. Of course it bears no resemblance to reality as far as serial killers go, but as a story it's a success, with engaging characters and excellent acting. Even from Kevin Costner. Especially the way he and William Hurt play off each other... those scenes are the best in the movie.</p></body></html>

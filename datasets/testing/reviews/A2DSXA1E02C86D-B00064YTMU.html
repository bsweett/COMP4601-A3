<meta name="summary" content="Did Nicole suspect?"></head><body><p>In COLLATERAL, Tom Cruise, TOP GUN hunk and LAST SAMURAI swashbuckling hero, has his first Bad Guy role that I can recall as he plays a vicious, cold-blooded assassin-for-hire. Say it ain't so, Tom! Did ex-wife Nicole Kidman suspect his darker side, you think?<br /><br />Here, Jamie Foxx plays Max, a low-achieving Los Angeles cabbie with dreams flogging the PM shift, who picks up Vincent (Cruise), who's just arrived in the city. Ostensibly, as Vincent explains, he's in town to gather overnight five signatures on a real estate deal before flying out the next morning. Vincent offers Max $700 to be his chauffeur for the wee hours before delivering him back to the airport on time. It isn't until Max's first stop, during which a body falls on the windshield of his ride from a fourth story window, that he realizes that perhaps his tip for the gig isn't big enough. Unfortunately, Vincent, with inexorable persuasion, says "drive on", after loading the body into the trunk. As the corpses begin to accumulate at various locales around the city, a street smart cop begins to connect the dots, and the chase is on.<br /><br />During the first two-thirds of the film, Vincent philosophizes about the inescapable presence of politically incorrect Death in the world, and his unremarkable and necessary role as a Grim Reaper. At times, the two men almost seem on the verge of bonding, as when Vincent bails Max out during an over-the-radio dispute with the latter's overbearing boss-dispatcher. And when Max apparently takes Vincent's advice to take the carpe diem thing more seriously than procrastinating his dreams as is his wont. But Max's overriding horror at the night's killing spree wins out.<br /><br />The last third of COLLATERAL degenerates into a typically Tinseltownish Babe-in-Peril-Saved-in-the Nick-of-Time scenario - something that should be suspected during the first 15 minutes, when Max emotionally connects with a fare,  a smart yet engagingly vulnerable Federal prosecutor (Jada Pinkett Smith) who needs to work late at the office prepping for tomorrow's opening of a big case. Now, while there's nothing wrong with that, and it is a nail-biter, it's not consistent with the refreshingly intelligent scripting of what came before. Thus, I can only award 4 stars for a failure to follow through. I must say, however, that the acting by both Cruise and Foxx is superb, and it's difficult to tell which is the Lead and which the Supporting role.<br /><br />Finally, I can unequivocally answer "no" to the last of Vincent's questions posed to Max. I've sometimes looked pretty dead on the Metro ride to work in the morning, and nobody's noticed.</p></body></html>

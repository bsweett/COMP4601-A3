When he was two years old and living in an orphenage, Santa visited the orphenage that he was staying at. He managed to sneak into Santa's bag of gifts and be taken back with Santa to the North Pole. When Santa and his elves realize that he brought back a human child, they decide to raise him as one of their own. Buddy is then taught to live like an elf and Buddy himself believes that he is one, until his 30th birthday. His surrogate father dubbed Papa Elf (Bob Newhart), tells Buddy the story, and that his real father is a man named Walter(James Cann) that lives in New York. Buddy sets off for New York to find his father and integrate himself into Walter's life that includes his wife Emily(Mary Steenburgen) and a ten year old son. The only problem is that since Buddy has been raised as an elf his whole life, he does not know how to act like a normal person. Buddy soon discovers that life in the big city is much different and much more difficult than life at the North Pole.<br /><br />I was probably more skeptical than I have been in a long time going into watching Elf. I cannot stand Will Ferrell and the idea of a grown man acting like an elf sounded ridiculous to me. But due to the fact that Elf received such praise from moviegoers, and since I am a huge fan of James Cann, I decided to put my skepticism aside and give Elf a shot. Let's just say that I was wrong with my intial reaction to this film, because it turned out to be funny and enjoyable. Since this is the type of role that Will Ferrell was designed for, he was suprisingly tolerable in this film, and despite the fact that the plot looks ridiculous on paper, it works well for the film. Will Ferrell makes the character and his situation believeable. You really start to accept the fact that the guy is a 30 year old elf. Ferrell literally brings the character to life. James Cann who is usually known for his dramatic and tough guy roles, puts on a solid performance in this movie. The reason why Cann is so funny in this film, is because he plays an uptight executive who is forced to accept a long lost son who is seemingly crazy. No matter what he does, he cannot get rid of Buddy and begins to feel obligated to take care of the son he never knew he had.<br /><br />Overall, Elf is a film that is perfect for the whole family. It provides quality laughs and makes you feel good about Christmas in general. The extra features are great. You get three different featurettes, deleted scenes, and more.<br /><br />4/5</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Totally flawed MR. BROOKS was worth the $3 paid to see it!"></head><body><p>The premise of MR. BROOKS is an interesting one,but the execution of this film is very muddled.<br /><br />Is Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) a multiple personality, a schizophrenic or merely a person with a "killing" addiction who tries to achieve sobriety through AA? I kept thinking that he was definitely a multiple "Sybil"-type because the alternate personality had a name,Marshall (William Hurt), as multiples do. I kept noticing the "glasses on, glasses off" routine throughout the film which is straight from SYBIL. Addictions do not have proper names.Having worked with multiples and addicts in real life this just didn't ring at all true to me.First flaw.<br /><br />Did Earl's wife ever wonder or question how and why he was out every night in a row? She always just went to bed! What kind of a mate is that? Second flaw.<br /><br />Detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) is thrown from a van going breakneck speed and is thrown back first into the air, crashes through a windshield with a deafening thud and only receives a small wound to the head? What is she made of? The scenes following reveal NO HEAD WOUND? In fact,this character had become "Wonder Woman" in order to prove to her father that a girl is a worthy person? C'mon!!!Third flaw.<br /><br />Were we ever sure that what  any of what the daughter said was true (not to give any spoiler!)? Fourth flaw.<br /><br />The film MR. BROOKS will not answer these questions and more? Was the idea for the film unique and interesting?-Yes. Was I entertained?-mildly. Was the acting anything special?-not really. Does the ending leave an opening for a sequel? Yes, but I don't think that would be prudent! Was alot of the dialogue pretty inane?-most definitely. Was I glad I saw this for $3 at a second-run Moviehouse? You betcha! Totally flawed.</p></body></html>

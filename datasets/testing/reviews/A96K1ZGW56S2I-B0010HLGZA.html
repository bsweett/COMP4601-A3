<meta name="summary" content="A Christmas Classic."></head><body><p>When A CHRISTMAS STORY originally arrived in theatres, it was only around for about three weeks because the studios didn't feel it would make any money and felt the story didn't lend itself to a longer theatrical run. It wasn't until the movie started airing on televsion and cable that people found out how great a movie A CHRISTMAS STORY is. Since then, the movie has become a piece of our American heritage, a part of the pop culture paradigm, and (like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE) a Christmas classic.<p>The film revolves around nine-year-old Ralphie whose only wish for Christmas is to own a genuine Red Ryder 200-shot Carbine Action BB gun. However, everyone from his mother to his teacher to Santa Claus himself tells him it's too dangerous and that "You'll shoot your eye out, kid." Along the way, Ralphie and his friends and family get involved in all sorts of comic mishaps. However, in the end everything turns out alright and everyone has a merry Christmas.<p>The movie is full of hilarious heartfelt nostalgia. Anyone who has ever been part of a family or from a rural (in mindset) town will enjoy watching this film again and again. Recommended for viewing at least once a year. And, oh, yeah; don't shoot your eye out.<p>The DVD includes the original theatrical trailer.</p></body></html>

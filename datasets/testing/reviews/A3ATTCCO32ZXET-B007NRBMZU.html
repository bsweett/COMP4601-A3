He rarely picks anything I would have, although about half the time his selections surprise me by being good.  Happily this turned out to be one of those situations.<p>TBE is about a boy growing up under a peculiar curse; he has occasional blackouts, during which he does things that he cannot remember afterwards and which usually traumatize everybody around him.  They often come at key moments of his life that end up in disaster before he comes back to himself.  CAT scans of his brain show no organic disorder.  Hypnosis doesn't reveal much.  His mom and circle of friends learn to accept him and cope with him, and he grows up with some strong friendships until he has to move at age 14.  That's the last he hears from them until he revisits childhood sweetheart seven years later.  Her life has been a downward spiral since he left and after he leaves this time she commits suicide.  Remorse drives him to reexamine his childhood journals for clues and answers to why things got so bad, and he makes a disturbing discovery:  he can travel back in time to those blackout periods and redo them.  The question now becomes, should he?  Because on every one of those "trips", his tampering has unexpected, horrible results for one or more of his loved ones.<p>I never used to think much of Ashton Kutcher, for better or for ill, but TBE changed my mind about him.  He proved that he can play a smart, compelling character with a good range of emotions.  I believe that Kutcher may have a future in Hollywood aside from the himbo roles he's been stuck with up until now.  Let's hope some casting directors agree.<p>My final opinion of TBE is that it is a somewhat dark, but well done film.  The plot is not perfect (toward the end there is a big plot hole that I won't reveal so I don't spoil it for you) but it does raise intelligent questions for the viewer to ponder on the long-term consequences of everything we do and what moments in our lives really decide who we will become.  It was also engaging on a more gut level that I can't explain, but I enjoyed the entire hour and fifty five minutes.  Recommended.<br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle</p></body></html>

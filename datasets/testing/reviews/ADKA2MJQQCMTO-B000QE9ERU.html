Man I REALLY wanted to like this too, but it's a dud.<p>I want to start on a positive note, because it's (at least) watchable.  There is SOME good in here, it's not ALL BAD.  Thomas Jane, I felt, did a really good job portraying the main character.  Come to think of it, I'll just throw out a blanket statement that all the acting (overall) was adequate.  The special effects, especially the car that was used as Frank Castle's ride, was really creatively done and well executed.  As I said before, this is watchable.<p>Man there are a TON of issues though.  Frustrating part is that EVERY PROBLEM I found with the movie was EXTREMELY FIXABLE.  Let's begin ...<p>I had reservations about the movie's South Florida location since it began filming.  The way I always pictured the Punisher, I always thought of a very dark, gritty, urban setting.  Bright, tropical, colorful Florida just never seemed to fit quite right to me.  Unfortunately, I was right.  To have Jane running around in the middle of the afternoon just looked odd.  The Punisher just isn't the kind of character that would attack something in broad daylight, in the middle of the afternoon, on a crowded city street.<p>There's an issue in the beginning of the movie, after Castle's family is slaughtered, where the timeline gets a little skewed.  Once Frank returned to the mainland where he was staying, we have absolutely NO IDEA how much time had passed.  Which reminds me, how exactly did that witch-doctor nurse Frank back to health?  Why even point that character out at all?  By all rights, Frank should have been on life-support after he was left for dead.  Wouldn't it serve the movie more to just have him wash up on the beach and then taken to a hospital as a 'John Doe'?  Seems to me it would have served the same purpose and helped explain his recovery a little better.  I'm not even going to mention asking where all of Castle's scars went when he takes his shirt off.  He should be littered with pock-marks and scars that just aren't there.  That witch-doctor must really know his stuff ...<p>There was CLEARLY a mole in the department that Frank Castle was working for.  Why was this point never pursued?  Castle was CLEARLY sold-out by someone, and yet (even after his ridiculous "I'm still alive" declaration) nobody ever readdresses the issue?  Speaking of which, why even make that speech in front of police headquarters?  Wouldn't that completely blow you're element of surprise?  That moment raised about a dozen questions that the film never bothered to answer.<p>I normally never notice this kind of thing, but THE SCORE WAS HORRIBLE.  Every time Howard Saint's character was on the screen, I swear they played the theme of Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers movies.  For that matter, all the villains were nothing more then mobster card-board cut-outs.<p>As far as the villains go, aside from Saint, they were all cartoons.  The hit-man from Memphis and his musical interlude?  What was with that?  It did nothing to forward the plot at all.  You could have completely cut him from the movie, maybe saved it for the DVD and lower the movie's running time by about 15 minutes.  The Russian also looked like a character out of a Street Fighter video game.<p>As far as the action, Lion's Gate was obviously pulling its punches.  The Punisher is a BRUTAL CHARACTER; it was almost comedic watching him meticulously setting up these elaborate traps for Saints goons to fall into.  He's supposed to be 'Rambo' not 'The Count of Monte Cristo.'<p>It just seems to me that the idea of who this character is and what drives him was totally lost by the end of the movie.  It's better then the Dolph Lungren movie; but they still haven't gotten it right either.  Oh well, we still have Spiderman 2 to look forward to ...</p></body></html>

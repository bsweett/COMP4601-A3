<meta name="summary" content="Hands up if you would honestly answer a ringing phone!"></head><body><p>There's no way I would pick up a ringing phone if I didn't know who was at the other end - especially out in the middle of the street! Hello, anything could happen! Which, consequently, happens in the film. Pick up the phone and it changes your life.<p>I've seen the trailer about a zillion times, if not more, so finally decided to get it. And despite getting told that it was rubbish, it's too short etc, I really enjoyed it! It's filmed practically in real time, there's not a lot of cast members, and there's not a whole lot of different locations to keep track of. And although I'm disappointed that Colin Farrell speaks with an American accent (I could just listen to him speak all day with his natural, 'Orish' accent!) And Radha Mitchell also appeared in Neighbours years ago, as Mal Kennedy's girlfriend, Catherine I think, and then wife.<p>There's never really a concrete reason as to why the sniper picked Stu - if anyone had answered the phone, would he still have attacked them verbally? Plus, Stu wasn't exactly having a hot, clothes ripping affair with Pam (Katie Holmes) now was he? He was merely fantasising about her - heaven forbid, he should be sent to hell for that! What guy doesn't fantasise about another girl when he's married/engaged/dating/single?<p>I wasn't sure about Kiefer Sutherland as the sniper. What was the point in him over the phone all the time? (I can't think of his voice, but it doesn't sound how I imagined him to sound) The finale seemed a little lame and unsatisfying to be honest. From the trailer, I honestly thought that something serious would happen to Stu. But it didn't. <p>But apart from that, I enjoyed the whole film! And if I ever am near a phone booth, and the phone starts ringing, I will seriously not answer it. Leave it up to someone else.</p></body></html>

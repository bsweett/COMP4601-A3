While the production values, costumes, soundtrack and cast are superb it's definitely lacking the magical "something" that raises a good film to a great one.<br /><br />There are some haunting cinematic moments not soon to be forgotten such as the sight of Elizabeth standing on a distant cliff along the dark and stormy coastline viewing the Spanish Armanda ablaze on the horizon, or the image of Elizabeth garbed in white armor with matching horse extolling the troops to greatness as her long flowing red hair and demeanor bears a striking resemblance to Saint Joan of Arc.<br /><br />Unfortunately the role of the legendary monarch is not fleshed out to the extent as it was in the script of the first film, leaving Cate Blanchett little new territory to explore within the psyche of the Virgin Queen. She is left with little to do other than vacillate between a compulsive control freak and a lonely, scorned lover along with occasionally striking a Madonna-like pose while the majestic soundtrack blares in the background clearly attempting to instill within the mind of the viewer a sense of awe and holiness.<br /><br />On the positive side, the most interesting addition to the storyline is Clive Owen in the role of explorer Walter Raleigh. It's only in Blancehtt's scenes with Clive that her character is allowed to show any emotional or intellectual depth. On a more personal basis, being by nature inclined to the arcane, I particularly appreciated the inclusion of the royal seer Dr. John Dee in the storyline.<br /><br />My Raing: Good, but not great, -3 ?

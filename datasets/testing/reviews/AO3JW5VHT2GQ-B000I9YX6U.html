Seymour (Sy) doesn't have much to look forward to outside of work, but there is one thing he cherishes - the Yorkin family: Nina (Connie Nielsen (I)), Will (Michael Vartan), and Jake (Dylan Smith (III)).  Sy 'the photo guy' has been developing their film since before Jake was born and has begun to feel like an uncle to Jake and a member of the family - he knows just about everything about them.  When his manager at work begins giving him a hard time, Sy immerses himself more deeply into his fantasies as a member of the Yorkin family, until he finds out that this seemingly perfect family isn't so perfect.  Taking matters into his own hands, Sy, likely using personal childhood recollections to guide him, resorts to unorthodox means to break the news to Nina about why Will is such a neglectful father.<p>My Comments:<br />This was a really well thought out and marvelously designed movie.  Robin Williams does a great job.  Almost the entire movie follows Robin Williams's character who says surprisingly little - but you are still entranced by what is going on.  The rest of the acting is pretty good as well.  <p>The special features of the DVD talk about how the SavMart has been designed to represent something of a fantasy world for Sy; I think that is something you kind of put together subconsciously, but when it is made clear what they have done it adds depth to the movie and Sy's character.  Though it seems straightforward,  there is so much going on the film that you can't really afford to miss any of it - you have to pay very close attention.  <p>The extra features on the DVD contain lots of commentary and some fun interviews - Robin Williams is hilarious in the Charlie Rose interview.  <p>Overall, I thought this was a great movie.  Excellent story, superb cinematography, and remarkable acting.  The social commentary was appropriately subtle but present in everything.  There is a bit of nudity, so if you don't care for that you may want to skip this one.  Otherwise, I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Greatest Film Noir Thriller Ever Made."></head><body><p>I am so glad my father made me watch this movie. "Laura" is a fantastic movie. It is, in my opinion, the greatest film noir thriller that has ever been created.<br /><br />Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) is put in charge of the murder of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney). He interviews the two men who knew her best: smarmy critic Waldo Lydecker (a perfectly creepy Clifton Webb) and her mysterious fiance Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price). As the case takes on many twists and turns, Mcpherson has become obsessed with Laura. He can't get her off his mind. But the biggest twist is yet to come - Laura is alive. As Laura and Mark attempt to get to the bottom of the case, a shocking climax draws closer to them.<br /><br />This film is perfect. Gene Tierney is stunning as Laura. Her icy sexuality and acting skills are perfect for this role. Dana Andrews is splendid as McPherson. Clifton Webb and Vincent Price offer ample support as well.<br /><br />This new dvd is filled with a ton of bonus features and the remastering job is excellent. This is a dvd that belongs in anyone's collection.</p></body></html>

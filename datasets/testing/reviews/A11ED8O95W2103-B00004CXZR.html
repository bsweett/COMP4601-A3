<meta name="summary" content="Epic, and still relevant today."></head><body><p>I first saw this movie in the theater back in 1979.  I still have the original plastic popcorn cups to prove it.<br /><br />At the time I thought it was slow and bombastic, and I was dissappointed that they rehashed "The Changeling" episode from the original series.<br /><br />Well, perhaps I've mellowed a bit but I watched this DVD version last night a thoroughly enjoyed it.  The key is to relax and soak in the experience.  It's sort of a great, epic, mood piece with incredible visuals and a gorgeous sound track.  Lower your expectations and let the movie come to you.<br /><br />But beyond this, the movie poses a rather important question.  What do you do if you spend your life searching for God, and you discover that God does not meet your pre-conceived notions of what He should be?  V'ger finds that her "god" is a "carbon unit" and she doesn't believe it, but when the "carbon unit" enters  the transmission code -- proving his claim to be "god" -- she puts her faith in him, and she joins herself to her "god" and becomes a greater being for it.  There's a little to ponder there.<br /><br />Beyond this, the documentaries on the second disk are interesting, and I enjoyed the various deleted scenes that showed the differences between this directors' cut and the original version.  I haven't sat through the commentary track, but I'm looking forward to it.<br /><br />Perhaps it wasn't all it could have been (and the documentaries explain a lot of why this is so) but I believe this movie has a lot to recommend it.  I'll probably watch it again every few years until I transition to whatever the next life turns out to be.</p></body></html>

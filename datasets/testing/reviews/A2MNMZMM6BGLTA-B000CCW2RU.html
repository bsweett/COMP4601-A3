<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Good"></head><body><p>I had heard that this movie didn't do all that well at first at the box office. I had really low expectations. After watching it I must say that I thought it was pretty good and had some really entertaining action sequences. It kind of reminded me of a Bruckhiemeer version of THX 1183. Scarlett Johansen and Ewan McGregor were both excellent in their roles. It had all the twists and turns that any movie involving the complexities and moral questions of cloning should have.<br /><br />I liked it. Check it out.</p></body></html>

As most people have no doubt heard, this year was the year that the hero who sets the standard for other heroes, the man known as 'The Last Son of Krypton', returned to theaters after an almost 20 year absence.  After allowing the franchise to die at the hands of "Superman 4: The Quest For Peace" (a movie that has long been rumored to have suffered due to too much studio tampering), Warner Brothers decided the moment was finally right to bring the Man of Steel back from his Hollywood grave.  For almost a decade the WB tried very hard to get a new Superman movie off the ground, using various writers, directors, and actors, ranging from Tim Burton and Brett Ratner as directors to Nicolas Cage and Brendan Fraser as stars, and even Kevin Smith as a writer at one point.  Finally, Warner Brothers enticed director Bryan Singer (director of "X-Men" and "X2: X-Men United") to leave the series he started at Fox only months before preparing to work on the final chapter in his 'X-Men' trilogy, and join them on bringing Superman back to the big screen in a way befitting the greatest superhero of all time.<br /><br />"Superman Returns" begins with a recently parolled Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) swindling a rich, old woman out of her fortune just before she dies, in hopes of using her money and resources to accomplish his greatest scheme ever, to use Kryptonian technology to take over the world, reshaping it any way he pleases.  How does Lex plan on succeeding with his mission of world domination with Superman being able to stop him.  Well, Superman (Brandon Routh) has been on a self-imposed exile to discover if Krypton may still exist somewhere in space, but after 5 years of searching he finally returns to Earth with the knowledge that he is indeed the last surviving member of the long dead planet.  However, upon Superman's return to Earth, he finds that his adopted planet has moved on, and figured out how to survive without him, including Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth).  Now Superman must come to grips with the fact that the people he cared about have moved on, and hope that he can be welcomed back into their lives as both Clark Kent and Superman.  Of course, if he is to be accepted on Earth again, there has to be an Earth to live on, so now Superman must find a way to stop Lex and advanced technology from his own world, before all hope is lost.<br /><br />After a nearly 20 year absence from the movie screen, was Bryan Singer's epic adventure worth the wait?  In a word, absolutely!  Bryan Singer and his writers Mike Daugherty and Dan Harris (writers of "X2: X-Men United") have brilliantly captured the spirit of Superman and continued on with the stories started in the previous 4 movies.  Although, if viewed in the proper context as intended by Singer, "Superman Returns" actually falls after "Superman 2", which is why many references are made to events from the first 2 movies via Jor-El (using Marlon Brando footage shot for "Superman" and "Superman 2") voiceovers.  In my opinion you can view this new installment after the fourth film that way you can fully enjoy the entire 'Superman' saga as originally intended.  The casting for "Superman Returns" is excellent all across the board.  Relative newcomer Brandon Routh does an excellent job of bringing Superman/Clark Kent to life, evoking the many emotions our hero goes through as he tries to redefine his place in our world.  The supporting actors each make their characters their own by taking what had previously been done with the characters throughout all their different incarnations and tweaking them for the modern day.  Kevin Spacey truly shines as Lex Luthor, though I enjoyed Gene Hackman's Lex, I feel that Kevin did a much better job of bringing the evil and duplicitous nature of Lex to life, while still holding on to some of his dark wit.  Kevin's wit actually resembles Michael Rosenbaum's portrayal on the hit TV show, "Smallville".  Kate Bosworth is perfect as Lois Lane, providing a much better interpretation of the character than Margot Kidder did in the Christopher Reeve movies, plus Kate is much easier on the eyes than Kidder ever was.  The rest of the cast with lesser parts were equally impressive from James Marsden's portrayal of Richard White, to Sam Huntington's Jimmy Olsen, and Frank Langella as Perry White, every actor truly shines in this movie.  The special effects for this movie are truly top-notch, the scenes with Superman flying are so incredible and awe-inspiring that you truly, honestly believe that you are actually witnessing a man flying.  The excellence that this movie achieves is so vast, that I truly could go on and on about what I think of this film, but I'll spare you having to sit here reading that, so bear with me for just one more moment as I sum up this movie.<br /><br />"Superman Returns" brings the Man of Steel back to life in such a magnificent way that you leave the theater wishing there were truly heroes like him in this world and wanting to see more of Earth's greatest protector in action.  If you haven't seen this movie, then I strongly recommend that you rush out and rent it the moment it hits DVD shelves.  Before viewing this movie you may want to give yourself a refresher course on what has occurred in the previous 4 movies, or at least the first 2.  So, with all that being said, sit back, relax, and remember what it's like to believe that a man can fly.<br /><br />"Superman Returns" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.</p></body></html>

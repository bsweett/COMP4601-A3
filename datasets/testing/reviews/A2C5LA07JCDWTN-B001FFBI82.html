What makes Jarhead stand out from all other war films is that there is seemingly no war going on for much of the duration of this film. Rather, it is a psychological journey inside the minds of marines who are simply waiting around for their chance to kill something...anything. So whether it be having scorpion death matches, an illegal hootch party or simply wacking off, the tone and tenor of the film never waivers. Its glaicial pacing is vital to preserving the tone of the film. So although, Jarhead is certainly not the best film about war ever made it is certainly unique and original. Sam Mendes continues to challenge the norm with his gutsy directorial choices and although this film is no American Beauty, it is still a fine addition to his resume. Jake Gyllenhaal does a good job as Anthony Swofford, simple, brooding and understated. My only problem with Jarhead is it's resolution or lack thereof. It seems as though the author has chosen to sidestep the most vital issues of the Gulf War for fear of taking sides. This is one of the only films I've ever seen where the author/director have actually gone out of their way to stradle the fence and it's disappointing but alas the good outweighs the bad here.

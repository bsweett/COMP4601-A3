They're almost always at least good, but many times a fair bit behind the original versions.  'The Ring', the movie that started the trend, is actually one of the ones that exceeds its predecessor.  It keeps everything that made <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000088NQR">Ringu</a> good, but benefits from some added angles, better special effects, and deeper characterization on some of the supporting players.  Also, it's not a shot-by-shot remake: in several instances backstory elements have been substitued for an alternate take on things.  In this case, both the original and the remake had equally cool takes on the backstory.  But I've always felt that if you're going to do a remake you just have to do Some things differently so it actually Is a different take on the same idea, not just a reshooting of the exact same movie.  The Ring differentiated itself enough so that you'll want to watch both versions, and enjoy not only the same theme but the differences here and there.  [Note - there's also a third version, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000929VS6">The Ring Virus</a>, a Korean remake of Ringu that came out, I believe, before the American remake.  I've really got to get on the ball and see that one too.)<br /><br />  The basic premise behind The Ring is now one of the best known set-ups in horror: there's a videotape out there, of unknown origin, and everyone who watches it dies exactly seven days later.  In addition, immediately after watching the tape, the viewer receives a phone call as a warning of their fate.  You never hear exactly what's said on the call, but you can just make out enough of it that, by that and the reaction of the person receiving the call (this is one of the things that really made The Ring so great - the tremendous jobs various performers did in reacting to things that aren't fully shown on screen) it really brings an instant air of sinister otherworldliness.  Naomi Watts plays the reporter who investigates this strange urban legend after four kids die after watching the tape - one of them her niece - and eventually comes into possession of the tape itself.  Totally disbelieving of any truth to the supernatural legend, she nonetheless watches the tape, looking for possible clues.  And proceeds to receive the phone call that all viewers are said to receive.  It quickly becomes impossible to discount anything about the legend, and worse still, Watts is horrified to get up one morning and find her young son Aidan (David Dorfman) innocently watching the video he found.  Now it's a race against time to track down the origins of the tape and try to stop the curse before it reaches its fated conclusion.  The trail leads to the story of a little girl named Samara (Daveigh Chase), now dead several years...<br /><br />  The Ring is a multi-layered horror story that gets scarier and scarier as it unfolds, riveting from the start but leaving the biggest and most memorable frights for the end stages.  The visual imagery of The Ring has become iconic in horrordom, including the stone well, first seen on the videotape itself, and the climax is a masterpiece.  Outstanding performances all around.  This is a horror must-have.</p></body></html>

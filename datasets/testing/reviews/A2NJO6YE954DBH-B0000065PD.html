<meta name="summary" content="The okay movie that became a really great television series"></head><body><p>It is interesting to watch the 1994 &quot;Stargate&quot; film from the perspective of the spin-off television series, &quot;Stargate SG-1,&quot; which is on its way to becoming the longest running science-fiction series of all-time.  As was the case with &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer,&quot; we have an okay film that becomes a first-rate television series.  <p>Once upon a time, 1928 to be exact, archeologists discovered a strange disc buried in the sand of Egypt.  The next thing we know we are in the present, and Egyptologist Daniel Jackson (James Spader), is having his colleagues walk out on him as he explains his radical theory about the ancient Egyptians and their language.  But then a mysterious old woman (Viveca Lindfors) gives him an invitation to travel to a secret military base buried beneath the Rocky Mountains to do translations.  Jackson has nothing else to do, so he shows up, immediately corrects all the mistakes and figures out all the mysteries, and the next thing we know he is being shown the Stargate.  He then joins a military group led by Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell), who has been recalled back to active duty to find out where you go to when you step through the Stargate.  The answer is you go to the other side of the known universe where you discover a desert planet where an alien who was known as Ra (Jaye Davidson) by the ancient Egyptians is lording it over the local humanoids.  <p>This movie is mostly eye candy.  Being shot on a desert planet means that it has lots of scenes shot in bright sunlight, which really is unusual for a science fiction film, where they tend to be dark and murky.  &quot;Stargate&quot; brings back the same sort of ideological tension between scientists and the military that we enjoyed during the 1950s with films like &quot;The Thing From Another World,&quot; as Jackson is all excited to explore a brave new world and O'Neill is looking for an excuse to blow everything up with the nuke in the big suitcase.<p>Truth about this movie is that it the ideas are a lot better than than the execution.  The idea of the Stargate is a nice way of circumventing the laws of physics that scoff at warp drive and other narrative necessities to a good space yarn.  It is not a far leap of logic to get from this one Stargate to the idea that there are others, and there is also the nice corrollary that this system explains why there are so many humans scattered throughout the galaxy where they all live on oxygen breathing planets.  <p>Beyond that the television series picks up on the Jackson-O'Neill dyad, reducing it to the idea that one is an academic and the other is a warrior and never the twain shall meet.  Of course Richard Dean Anderson's O'Neill is even quirkier than Spader's Jackson, while Michael Shanks's Jackson starts off even more humorless than Russell's O'Neill.  But it all works, so why quibble?  The original &quot;Stargate&quot; ends up being more about style than substance, which is why it is so interesting that the television series could find something substantial upon which to build a television series.  <p>If you have yet to see &quot;Stargate&quot; in any version, then you are strongly urged to proceed immediately from this 1994 film to the first season of &quot;Stargate SG-1.&quot;  Even if you find this film tedious, just get through it and move on to the good stuff.  You could not pass go and head directly for season one of &quot;Stargate SG-1,&quot; but you really need to know the players and some of the rules of the game before hand.</p></body></html>

Do want the film to be predictable? What if you were told that every moment you experienced and every memory you held dear never happened? In Revolution Studios' haunting psychological thriller The Forgotten, Telly Paretta (Julianne Moore) is tormented by the memory of her eight-year-old son Sam's death in a plane crash 14 months ago. While trying to work through her grief, and her subsequent estrangement from her husband Jim (Anthony Edwards), she is informed by her psychiatrist, Dr. Munce (Gary Sinise), that she is suffering from delusions, that her son never existed and she is fabricating his memories. Stunned, she tries to find evidence of Sam's existence photos, videos, scrapbooks. But it has all disappeared. Telly is convinced she is going mad until she meets Ash Correll the father of one of the other plane crash victims. Together, they embark on a search to prove the existence of their children and reclaim their sanity. So what's the problem? The premise grows too ridiculous to take seriously. That's what is wrong with it. Beautifully shot, some so-so preformances, some good scares but nothing that'll keep you up at night. Rent it.</p></body></html>

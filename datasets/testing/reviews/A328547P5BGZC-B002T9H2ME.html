Do yourself a favor and check out "Moon"!<br /><br />Sam Rockwell is phenomenal as Sam Bell! He once again brings the perfect blend of quirky, funny & dramatic that he is well known for - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001O2UTQS">Choke</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008XERA">Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DN0V02">Snow Angels</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012QLB4">Matchstick Men</a> & <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A283AW">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>!<br /><br />Sam Bell has a three year contract to work for Lunar Industries. Fuels are in shortage on Earth and his responsibility is to harvest and periodically send back supplies of helium-3, the current clean and abundant fuel used on Earth. There is no live communication link between the lunar station and Earth, his only interaction & friend is with GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey), the intelligent computer whose function is to attend to his day to day needs.<br /><br />With two weeks to go, he gets into an accident at one of the mechanical harvesters and is rendered unconscious. Injured, he awakens back at the station in the infirmary, he assumes assisted by GERTY. GERTY tells him that a rescue team named Eliza will come to the station to repair the wrecked harvester. After his recuperation, he takes an unauthorized trip back to the broken harvester, where he makes an unexpected discovery. Bell begins to doubt his sanity, then his true identity, then the company and GERTY's willingness to do what is best for him.<br /><br />Great storyline, characters, acting & a one of a kind psychological thriller!<br /><br />If you enjoyed "Moon", check out some other great space thrillers - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y7U98C">Sunshine</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009ATIX">Solaris</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/079073639X">Sphere</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX44">Red Planet</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CWU3">Mission To Mars</a>!<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended!<br /><br />Enjoy~</p></body></html>

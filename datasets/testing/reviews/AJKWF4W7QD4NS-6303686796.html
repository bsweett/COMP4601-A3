<meta name="summary" content="A haunting, dizzying American classic"></head><body><p>Director Martin Scorsese (hot off of his critical breakthrough Mean Streets) directed this film that was destined to become an all time landmark in American cinema, and announced to the world the acting genius of Robert De Niro.  De Niro plays psychotic cabbie Travis Bickle; an ex-Marine who takes a job driving a taxi because he can't sleep.  He is driven to be a vigilante by seeing the ceaspool the city has become, while trying to protect a young prostitute (Jodie Foster) from her pimp (Harvey Keitel).  Screenwriter Paul Schrader wrote the character of Travis Bickle so vividly, and De Niro perfectly captures the essence of this psychotic man living in a world decaying around him.  Peter Boyle, Cybil Sheppard, and Albert Brooks also star, and look for Scorsese in a small role as a man following his cheating wife (the exchange between him and De Niro has quite a lasting effect).  DVD extras include some interviews and trailers, but I would have loved to hear a commentary from Scorsese and/or De Niro.  All in all, Taxi Driver may not be for everyone, but those who have never gotten the chance to see this should consider seeing it.  The final ten minutes are some of the most gripping and chilling scenes in all of American cinema.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Spielberg, Hanks and DiCaprio try their hand at light comedy"></head><body><p>The problem with "Catch Me If You Can" depends on whether you are vexed with the director or the starring actors.  If you go the Dawson Leery route and are a fan of Steven Spielberg then it seems the complaint is that this film is no "E.T.," "Jurassic Park" or "Schindler's List."  But if you are a fan of Tom Hanks then the complaint would be that this is not a "Philadelphia," "Forrest Gump," or "Cast Away."  The idea that Spielberg and Hanks, who worked together on "Saving Private Ryan," would spend there time on this trifle seems to be too much for some fans to take.  But then Leonardo DiCaprio, who has seen little sign of the critical success ("What's Eating Gilbert Grape") or box office success ("Titanic") of his earlier days is probably just happy to have had movies with Spielberg and Martin Scorsese out at the same time.  Okay, so "Catch Me If You Can" is not a great film.  It is a very good film and that puts all the parties concerned ahead of the game given the standard fare from Hollywood.<p>The story might not be about life and death, but it is certainly compelling.  Young Frank W. Abagnale Jr (DiCaprio) runs away from home rather than deal with the divorce of his parents and has to live by his wits and the checkbook in his back pocket.  It turns out his wits are pretty good and he is not only able to pass millions of dollars worth of bad checks, but pass himself off as an airline pilot, doctor, and lawyer.  Doggedly pursuing him is F.B.I. agent Carl Hanratty (Hanks), who knows that Frank is really a beggarman and thief.  Actually, we know that Frank will get his man, because that is how the film opens, and it is as Hanratty is bringing Frank back to the United States from France that the story is revealed.<p>"Catch Me If You Can," based on Abagnale's biography, is the story of an engaging rogue who uses his charm and aforementioned quick wits to get himself out of one sticky situation after another.  The man had panache, which is exemplified when he has to get through the Miami airport despite the fact Hanratty has F.B.I. agents at every other line.  The movie is not really a primer for a life of crime since Abagnale's did his con man act in the Sixties and technology has advanced well beyond his effective use of a bathtub full of water and model airplanes to make thousands of dollars.  <p>In addition to the questions regarding how Frank does it and how Hanratty catches him, there is the relationship between the two men as well as the relationship between Frank and his father (Christopher Walken), from whom he gets his charm and sense of larceny.  It is when the film operates on this level that "Catch Me If You Can" becomes another classic Spielberg film, at least in the sense of the constant theme of symbolic fathers and sons, even if it never gets churned into real butter.  <p>This is an enjoyable film even if it does not fall into the category of joining other Spielberg, Hanks, and DiCaprio films that you have in your video library for convenient repeat viewing.  There is a bonus disc with the DVD version, which only has 75 minutes worth of extra material, mostly about the real Frank Abegnale Jr. (maybe when Spielberg has to put kids through college or something he will break down and start doing commentary tracks so I can get enjoy a course in filmmaking in the comfort of my own home).  If you really are insulted by Spielberg and Hanks doing this project, just wait until next year's "Terminal."  Hang in there.</p></body></html>

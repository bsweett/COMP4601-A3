<meta name="summary" content="A Tight, Taut Script and Impeccable Cast  Create a Winner for Richard Shepard"></head><body><p>THE MATADOR is one of those surprising films whose title seems to suggest something entirely different from the story it tells - until the viewer has the pleasure of viewing this fast paced, immensely entertaining comedy and 'Matador' takes on a whole new meaning!<br /><br />Richard Shepard wrote and directed this story of a hitman (Pierce Brosnan in one of his finest roles) on the skids who happens to meet a sweet nice guy (Greg Kinnear) whose business is so on the skids that he has traveled to Mexico City for a chance for survival, temporarily leaving behind his wife (Hope Davis) in the midst of a rainy accident to their home.  The two disparate men meet in a bar, share drinks, and after some of the cleverest tete a tete on film form a bond that neither of them expects.  Brosnan's hitman character and Kinnear's slipping business failure at first collide and then mutually benefit from embracing what seem to be polar opposites of characters.  How the whole chance meeting alters their lives is hilarious, edgy, and tender.<br /><br />Brosnan, Kinnear, and Davis display fine ensemble acting and keep the movie constantly flowing despite the strange twists and turns the story takes.  But a great deal of the credit goes to the razor sharp direction of Richard Shepard whose sense of comic and dramatic timing are superb.  This is a very well done, highly entertaining film that offers the cast plum roles and the audience a terrific evening of entertainment.  Grady Harp, July 06</p></body></html>

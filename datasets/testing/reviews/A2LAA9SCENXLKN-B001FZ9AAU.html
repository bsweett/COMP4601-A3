Just the movies unless otherwise stated.<br /><br />Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.<br /><br />This is one of those rare ones, like The Lightning Thief, it is new Popcorn Entertainment. It ain't real entertainment, it is popcorn entertainment. For most of the movie, I enjoyed the mind-numbing action and the special effects, cheesy lines and everything else that goes good on movie snacks. Don't expect this to be the companion of The Dark Knight and Incredible Hulk, this is more along the companions of Superman The Movie except modern.<br /><br />One thing I found intreging is that people disrespect Robert Downey Jr., he is a great actor, I definatly like his personality. Sherlock Holmes, stuff like that. I don't think this movie DOES or DOES NOT deserve it's amount of fame, it's just fun and nothing else. It's better than what Avatar got, when it deserved nothing. Avatar was a bad movie! But, I don't wanna spend every single one of my reviews talking about how much I hate avatar.<br /><br />Another thing I'm liking is the choice of AC/DC for the music score. Any movie would go great with some AC/DC my friend! (A little Metallica wouldn't hurt either.) The characters are all blockbuster hollywood of 2008, heck, that's how everything feels like, and what's to say that that's a bad thing? This ain't one of the best comic book movies ever, but it is definatly fun.<br /><br />Well, that's it, don't expect the experience of your life just expect fun. There is not much more to say since the whole movie is pretty predictable in that aspect. One more thing:<br /><br />I AM DA CA$HMAN, SIGNING OFF YES I AM.</p></body></html>

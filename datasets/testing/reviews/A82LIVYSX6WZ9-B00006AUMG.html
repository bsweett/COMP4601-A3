A lot more blood with some messed up new nemesis'(the effects for how they suck the blood is great, must taste yummy). Snipes is always cool is this part and I think it fits him and I think its his best role, being the daywalker. The action hits cool with some new vampire slayings and there's one dopey scene in which Blade and that chick fight by the highlights, I mean come on you can tell that's fake, but the other effects are way cooler. I just hated that Danny John Jules (Cat from Red dwarf) had to die in the sewers as a lot of those Reapers came up and killed him. A good time.<p>...</p></body></html>

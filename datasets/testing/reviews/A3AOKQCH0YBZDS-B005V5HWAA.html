It isn't so much of a thriller, as it is a different take/point of view on the serial killer that we normally don't see in most Hollywood films of today.<br /><br />Kevin Costner plays Mr. Brooks and this is one of Costner's best performances to date. Mr. Brooks is a respectable business man, whom has won a business man of the year award, is a loving husband & father. He seems like the guy next door, whom you could trust with your life. Yet Mr. Brooks has another darker, secret side of his life, that of a serial killer and he somehow has managed to compartmentalize his two different lifestyles. One lifestyles never meets the other one.<br /><br />Mr. Brooks sees himself more of an addict, much like that of an alcoholic or drug addict and attends meetings aimed for recovering substance abusers in hopes that a 12 step program will help him curb his addiction to killing (Of course, Mr. Brooks never states he is a serial killer at the meetings, just that he's an addict).<br /><br />Another interesting aspect of this movie is William Hurts role, which is that of Mr. Brooks' conscience/counterpart. We see the two interact throughout the movie and are given insight to what Mr. Brooks is thinking and feeling, which is an interesting perspective and nicely done.<br /><br />This movie is very captivating/engaging throughout its entirety and keeps you guessing to the end as to how it will turn out.... will the police catch him or will he get away with his crimes?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Music with a murderous beat..."></head><body><p>This Broadway-to-screen musical is one I could have lived without. Its winning the academy awards makes one wonder. Obviously, it is not my kind of music. <p>Roxie would have been a smash at the Roxy Theater. From the ads, I had expected her to be a copy of Marilyn Monroe; instead, she was Shirley MacLaine as Sweet Charity. <p>In my opinion, the best part of this strange combined crime story/musical was the bittersweet piece by Amos (John C. Reilly). There were actually only three big numbers all of which expended a great deal of energy and talent. <p>The actor who played the judge was perfect for that part --liked the portrait of the blindfolded Miss Justice behind the judge in courtroom. <p>Richard Gere has aged well, but can he really tap dance?  This trial (reminiscent of the Scopes fiasco of times gone by) proved that all criminal attorneys must be showmen at times. <p>That was a sleazy time in America's musical history; it was a decandent era as shown so well in THE CAT'S MEOW, about the Hearst coverup of the mysterious death on his yacht, which has similar music but no big performances. <p>The premise of a crime story turned into a musical may not be new, but it was strange going.</p></body></html>

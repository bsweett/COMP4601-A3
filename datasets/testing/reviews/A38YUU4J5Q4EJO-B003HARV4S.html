It is a turn of the century love story between Edward Norton (the illusionist) and Jessica Beil.<br /><br />They were childhood sweethearts, unwillingly seperated as youngsters, but cross paths years later, at one of Norton's shows.<br />She is already engaged to a crowned prince, but still loves Norton's character.<br />They decide they want to be together again, and this is where the movie takes off.<br /><br />The story itself is WONDERFUL, but even more than that, The reason I wrote this review was just to comment on the QUALITY of this picture. The sets are so wonderful, it will have you totally believing that you fell through a hole in time. The picture quality is so out of this world that the regular DVD looks like it is in high definition...Not only is the quality sharp, the entire movie has a beautiful golden hue, and I swear it looks like you are in an oil painting.<br /><br />I have seen good cinematography on movies like "Lord of the rings", or "The Village" but this is the best I've seen.<br />The casting too, couldn't have been done any better.<br />Take all that, add a great storyline, and you have a MASTERPIECE !!!</p></body></html>

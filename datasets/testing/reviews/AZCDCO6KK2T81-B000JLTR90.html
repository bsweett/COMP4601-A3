We didn't hate it, but we were certainly disappointed considering our high expectation of M. Night Shyamalan.  I thought "The Sixth Sense" was riviting entertainment that both scared and moved me.  "Unbreakable" was interesting, but not a great follow-up to his previous success.  "Signs" was no less than brilliant and had everything going for it like the acting, script, music, and so forth.  I think it's Shyamalan's best work.  "The Village" was better than "Unbreakable", but that is not necessarily a compliment.  I had hoped that "Lady in the Water" would be better than the critics treated it and although it is, it is still a disappointment.<br /><br />Then why the three stars, Steve?  Well, it is clever in some areas.  The casting is terrific.  Bryce Howard, The Village, is a young star on the rise who holds your attention and was a great choice for the leading role, and Paul Giamatti is turning out to be an acting find after numerous low-key, but terrric roles in such films as Cinderella Man, The Illusionist, and Sideways.  I love this guy's unobtrusive acting style.  You just believe anything about him in a role that he asks of you.  I have to admit that I also got a kick out of how Shyamalan gets back at his critics with the character Bob Babalon plays in the film, a deadbeat critic who is on the skids, but gives what appears to be insightful info to Giamatti's character.<br /><br />Lastly, the spotlight review by Kasia really made me think twice about the film.  It is rare when one reviewer, whom you might disagree with, can make you re-examine your position on something.  I will have to watch this film another time as Kasia made some really good observations and taught me why some actually liked this film more than I did.</p></body></html>

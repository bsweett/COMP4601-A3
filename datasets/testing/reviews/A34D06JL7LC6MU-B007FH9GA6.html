<meta name="summary" content="A Dark, Highly Effective Film"></head><body><p>Whether you call it a remake of the 2009 Swedish film or an American adaptation of the novel, this English-language version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has arrived. In the interest of simplicity, I'll refer to it as a remake hence forth. The books by Stieg Larsson are quite popular in America and the Swedish films have been seen by a pretty wide American audience given their foreign nature. I have never read Larsson's books, but I've seen all three of the Swedish films based on them. The films, particularly the first one, are so accessible to the average American moviegoer and are so widely available that an American version just seemed strange and unnecessary. When David Fincher, riding the wave of universal acclaim from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HWT6DO">The Social Network</a>, signed on to direct and cast up-and-coming actress Rooney Mara as the iconic Lisbeth Salander, my doubts were lessened. The announcement that newly minted Oscar-winners Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross would collaborate with Fincher to again provide the score didn't hurt either. There is no use comparing Fincher's version with Niels Arden Oplev's. It's not exactly apples and oranges, but it accomplishes nothing. It's a more effective measure to analyze this on its own merit rather than nitpick and compare every aspect with the film that came before it. Fincher's style is so prevalent that it's easy to believe he didn't take any inspiration from the previous adaptation, having adopted a style and tone for the film that is all his own. If he goes on to direct the sequels, the overall atmosphere alone will make them easy to distinguish from the versions before it. Additionally, I won't say one is better than the other for several reasons. One is that this version is much fresher in my mind and another is my feeling that this version loses an edge because of my familiarity with the story. A lot of suspense or mystery that may have been handled more effectively here may have been lost on me. Regardless, I'll get on with it.<br /><br />The film quickly sets the tone with Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) receiving a framed drawing of a flower at his home on Hedeby Island. The screen goes dark, Trent Reznor's atmospheric rendition of Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song starts in, and the stylized, gritty opening credit sequence begins, hearkening back to Fincher's earlier career directing music videos. Enter Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), writer and co-owner of Millennium Magazine, who fears he has ruined his reputation after losing a libel case to a wealthy businessman. Meanwhile, lawyer Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff) has commissioned an extensive background check on Blomkvist from Lisbeth Salander, a computer hacker and researcher for a security firm. Her report convinces Frode to introduce Blomkvist to his client Henrik Vanger. Impressed with his investigative reporting skills, Henrik wants Blomkvist to help him solve the 40-year-old murder of his niece Harriet under the guise of helping him write his memoirs. Though a body has never been uncovered, Henrik is convinced that his niece was murdered by someone in his own family. Everyone on the island is suspect and Henrik makes Blomkvist an offer he can't refuse.<br /><br />The film jumps back and forth between Blomkvist and Salander, who don't team up until quite late into the movie. With a runtime of 160 minutes, there's no real need to rush anything. There's a very memorable, graphic scene in the Swedish version that involves Salander, her guardian, and a tattoo gun. I recall watching this scene, knowing an American version was in the works, and being flabbergasted by it. There was no way I could fathom that scene being depicted in a mainstream American film. The American version of Let the Right One In was too afraid to recreate a single shot for American audiences (if you've seen both versions, you should know the shot), so how was Fincher going to get away with this? To my surprise, he did get away with it and this harrowing, graphic torture scene is just one example of his refusal to sanitize the violent and sexual nature of the film. He promised this would be a hard `R' and he delivered. Never before have I seen an R-rated film and thought `how is this not NC-17?' To see this content play on a movie screen in a large, corporate theatre is a validation of what driven, stubborn directors can do with total control over their vision. A lot of the graphic nudity and violence depicted here in unheard of in a mainstream American film. You'd be lucky if you could find some of this stuff at your local art house theater.<br /><br />Since Fight Club, Fincher has adopted a unique style that becomes more developed with each passing film. There are several scenes here where he goes full-Kubrick, mastering his grip over the sinister and the ominous. I bring up Kubrick because Fincher has become adept at creating a disconnected atmosphere that casts a spell over the audience. Fincher and cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth give The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo a dark and grungy, yet sophisticated look that takes advantage of Sweden's weather to lend itself to the overall atmosphere. This atmosphere is most potent in flashback scenes, creating a whole separate mood. There are some incredible shots here that should bring Cronenweth richly deserved awards recognition, as this one of the most well shot movies of the year.<br /><br />Reznor and Ross deliver a score that actually heightens the effect of the material, moving in such perfect sync with the film that they become codependent with one another. I was not as impressed as I was with their work on The Social Network, but it may just have been more subtle or lacked the same freshness. Whatever the case, these two have the potential to do great things for movie music. It comes as no surprise that Fincher has wrangled terrific performances from his cast. Craig makes a great Blomkvist, assured, but not too arrogant. It's a great example of his acting range, as he effortlessly transitions from the fearless James Bond to the confused Blomkvist. Stellan Skarsg?rd as Martin Vanger...Damn. An actor with plenty of work under his belt in two countries, he deserves more roles of this sort.<br /><br />Finally, there's the controversial casting of Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. Noomi Rapace's earlier performance became so closely associated with the character that people would have been up in arms if she had reprised the role herself. Mara made a big impression with her brief scenes in The Social Network, but this performance shows what she's really capable of. It's a remarkable transformation and she's in total command of the screen when she's on it. With her beauty completely obscured under the strange hair, piercings, and makeup; she's tough, troubled, and fascinating. She's occasionally sexy too, but this comes not from physical attributes, but the confidence in her performance. I'd have to watch the two performances in close proximity to say for sure, but Mara may give a more psychologically complex performance that Rapace. Her performance is brilliant.<br /><br />Fincher knows of his talent and this film is a more assured directorial effort, especially in regards to his ability at handling drama, suspense, violence, mystery, etc. His talent has made The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo stand as its own film. That's not to say it's perfect, with an epilogue that seems to stretch a bit too long. However, the final scene, a new addition, wraps everything up and has more bite than the Swedish version, making this one pack a more emotional wallop. It's an enthralling film that has carved a place on my top ten for the year, a welcome and different breed from the typical film to find its way onto such a list. The story is a high-minded mystery yarn, tailor-made for this century that would not be the success it is without its memorable female protagonist and the talented filmmakers bringing the story to life. Unlike most of the year's best films, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is little more than supreme, well-made entertainment. I'll be surprised if it's nominated for any Academy Awards beyond acting, directing, photography, and music. Its status as a remake certainly won't help it receive additional accolades. Fortunately, I had high hopes for this and it totally delivered. I hope Fincher goes on to direct the next two installments so I can see what else he has to offer the series. It may not be a "great movie" in the traditional sense, but it has all the cinematic ingredients of one, coupled with great entertainment and potent atmosphere. It's nice to see a potential franchise unabashedly geared for adults. I hesitate to call it "one of the best films of the year," but The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is one of my favorite films of the year and is more of an achievement on a cinematic level than many of the films superior to it.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></body></html>

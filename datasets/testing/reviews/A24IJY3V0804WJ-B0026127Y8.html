Now he has a quiet existence and works moonlighting as a part time body guard for a pop stars. His daughter goes to Paris with a friend and within hours of arriving is kidnapped by Albanian pimps who sell young girls in to the skin trade, and Neeson has 96 hours to find his daughter before she completely disappears forever. This springs him in to action and where the action starts. Many action scenes and bodies later, you have a satisfying conclusion. This movie ended quite accidentally on my DVD queue because I generally steer away from movies about the skin trade and terrorism, two genres I feel have been killed mindlessly. I watched this movie and was pleasantly entertained. Okay, this is not the most fantastic storytelling but the 96 minute running time passed quickly for me. Liam Neeson finally delivers a audience friendly movie which is instantly derided by critics. They would rather have you make mindless drivel which is only understood by them than a movie that endears you to the masses. If your movie becomes a success, they will then start accusing you of selling out. I think this movie will be enjoyed by all; you will be taken not by the script but by the treatment. 3 1/2 stars 111909</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An interesting experiment in visuals"></head><body><p>With a terribly thin plot, and wooden performances from its accomplished ensemble cast, Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow still delivers in a kind of invigorating, stimulating and cornball way. The highlight of the movie is obviously the astounding visual effects, all add later by digital computer. The story, characters, and everything else are merely vehicles for the special effects. The movie has a sheer audacity and boldness of vision, but the admiration quickly evaporates after 15 minutes when one thinks of the film's numerous plot holes, the terrible writing, and the actors that are generally stiff and non-inspiring.<br /><br />The generic plot plunders every classic film from The Wizard of Oz to Star Wars and Indiana Jones. The story centers on the mystery of a group of disappearing scientists in the 1930's. Perky reporter Polly Perkins (spunkily played by Gwyneth Paltrow) tries to find out what happened to them. After meeting one of the scientists, she's trapped on the streets of Manhattan when futuristic, giant robots begin to storm the city in search of power filled generators. Joe 'Sky Captain' Sullivan (Jude Law) is called to save the day. Joe and Polly have a history together and three years ago had a falling out, but they manage to put their animosity aside in order to search for the scientists and figure out where the robots are coming from. Along the way the meet a leather-clad, eye patched British naval captain (appallingly played by Angelina Jolie), who commands a fleet of aircraft carrier-like flying vehicles with the Union Jack plastered on the front.<br /><br />Viewers who like movies with lots of action and visual affects are going to enjoy this film. Although this viewer found that the cinematography had a fake, grainy, soft quality that was a little too dark, too often. The film also had a weird, out of focus, washed out feel to it, that made Gwyneth, Jude and Angelina look good, but at times, made it difficult to see the effects sequences taking place around them.  If nothing else, the film will probably succeed in fooling the viewer - never once did this viewer feel that this "world of tomorrow" was just CGI and that the actors were really working against a blue screen.

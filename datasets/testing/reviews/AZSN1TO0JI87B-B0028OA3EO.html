When "Superman II" rolled around, it hit rough waters. Production problems, combined with an end result that felt a little mixed, made for a good sequel, but trouble was apparently on the way. Following it up, were two films that put the nail in the coffin of the franchise for two decades, "Superman III" and "Superman IV: The Quest For Peace." These films are best forgotten, and such is the premise of "Superman Returns."<br /><br />Taking flight as a direct sequel to the original, with very loose ties to the second movie, "Superman Returns" is basically an attempt to make up for lost time and to finally show the world that Superman is truly an icon, not just some guy in a spandex costume, floating behind a blue-screen. Newcomer Brandon Routh replaces the late-Christopher Reeve, and does a splendid job. Routh is dead on in his portrayal as both Superman and Clark Kent (my only regret is that there wasn't much Kent to be found in this movie). The brilliant Kevin Spacey does Lex Luthor sweet, sweet justice, and not to do degrade Hackman's prior performances, but Spacey serves up the most threatening and diabolical version of the character. Behind the direction of Bryan Singer, who helped bring the "X-Men" franchise to the surface, "Superman Returns" is a success by nearly all accounts. Despite it's flaws, such as a mis-cast Lois Lane in Kate Bosworth, and a somewhat predictable plot, this film is easily the most action packed and enjoyable blockbuster of the year, and truly revitalizes Superman.<br /><br />It's sad that it took the success of another Warner property, the outstanding "Batman Begins," last year to get this movie, (which had spent years in development Hell), up and off the ground, but alas, Superman has been reintroduced into the public eye, and in a big way. The best part about this movie is that not only is it true to the source material, and to the film(s) that precede it, but it's also a film that wasn't tailor made just to please the Superman faithful. "Superman Returns" is a film that everyone and anyone can find enjoyment in.</p></body></html>

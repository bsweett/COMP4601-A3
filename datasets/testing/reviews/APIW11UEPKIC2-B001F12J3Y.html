<meta name="summary" content="Alright, well let him off, but were puttin him on the check list twice for next year"></head><body><p>A young boy is sitting in bed Christmas Eve and all that he can think about is how fake Santa is.  Well, he will soon learn the truth.  In the middle of the night the Polar Express shows up right in front of his house.  The boy can't help but get on this magical train that is heading for the north pole.  From here on it is a rollercoaster ride, and some times even more fun than a rollercoaster.  The animation is definitely something I could not look away from and is so lifelike you forget you are watching an animated movie at times.  The only flaws in the film are a some what creepy scene with a bum who lives on the top of the train and then there is your standard animation movie singing scene.  But they were good singers I guess.<br /><br />Now if you remember reading this book as a little kid like me than you will not be dissapointed one bit.  The main thing I remember was the book had a great ending I actually liked the movie ending more!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great action film....."></head><body><p>I was a little skeptical before watching this film. Bruce has gotten much older since the original "Die Hard" and the world, as well as movies in general, have changed a lot. I was wondering if the latest outing in the Die Hard franchise was going to be a cheesy, tiresome, re-hash of what we've seen before.<br /><br />I'm happy to say that I was proven wrong. "Live Free" starts off with a bang and doesn't let up until the very end. Not only does Bruce pull off the role of a much older and much more cynical John McClane, he does it with style and believability.<br /><br />The stunts and action scenes are some of the best I've seen in a long time. The pace of the film only slows down long enough to fill the viewer in on some important details and plot devices and then gets right back to it. There was one stunt, however, that did seem a little too unrealistic to me (just watch for yourself and see if you can pick it out), which, for me, took away from the movie's credibility causing me to dedcut 1/2 of a star from the rating.<br /><br />The other half star was deducted from my review because of the strange coloration of the film. Everything seemed to be either black, dark blue, grey, or olive which gave the film an overall dark tone which, I guess, was done to match its doomsday theme. To me, though, it was a distraction. The other films in the franchise were colored normally, so why should this one be any different? Oh well. A little detail like this probably won't bother anyone else.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this one much more than "Die Hard 2" and "Die Hard: With a Vengeance", but not as much as the first "Die Hard". It's a great action film with an interesting premise, some terrific stunts, and amazing special effects and action sequences. This movie should be enough to satisfy any action film junkie.</p></body></html>

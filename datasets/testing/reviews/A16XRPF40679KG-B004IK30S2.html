<meta name="summary" content="ferrels best comedy"></head><body><p>This limited edition version which is only at sale at a certain retail chain  and here evidently features a interesting box with a 'diary' of Ron Burgundy and trading cards. The package has two blu ray discs with a unrated  version of the movie and a made for dvd flick as well. I don't know if they will release this modern classic comedy on a regular blu ray without the extra film but certainly the packaging will be different after this edition sells out. Making it a collectors edition. This imo is a modern classic comedy, the movie just does everything right , it's funny and has great acting from everyone involved and it features the golden age of news anchorpeople the seventies, that was the decade when women really made inroads into the field and laid the groundwork for all the top anchors that would follow. The seventies too are always a great decade to have a comedy in, it's the predigital age (1980's-) and things were in someways better than today for sure, others not. but at least they didn't have bad rap music to contend with.<br />The characters are real enough not be believable too, after all the seventies was THe decade of excess and personal out of control freedom gone amuck. The blu ray looks stunning on all versions in this package. This one sold out at the chain store I got it at so grab this limited edition if you are a fan of great comedy and this one has quite a following because in the last decade it was one of the better comedies out there. And this one is without a doubt Will Ferrels most complete character and best work of his comedy career. He just creates a perfect character here which is more realized than some of his others movies characters.</p></body></html>

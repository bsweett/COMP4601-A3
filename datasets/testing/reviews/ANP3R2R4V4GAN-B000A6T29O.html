<meta name="summary" content="Great movie"></head><body><p>I really liked this film. I liked it so much I went to se eit in the movies twice. TWICE! And I had to sit thee with ... 12 year old boys and was about to get into a debate with them on the veracity of Ms. Jolie's...eeeeeehhhhhhhh..........endowments. She is a beautiful woman. Beautiful in not simply an exotic way, but a naturally exotic way. She also seems like an actress who is comfortable with what is going on around her. I've seen her in a couple of movies and she seems very comfortable with the sihft from romance to thriller to action hero. The plot is a little convoluted in the sense that it goes really far out on a limb about the Illuminati and the alignment of planets. That was a little hard to believe. That a society could exist for only one moment in time. If maybe this happened every 50 years, that might've been more believable and the time traveling was handled nicely as more or reality altering than true going back.<br />The action scenes are great particuliarly the aerial fight when theives break into her mansion. I have to admit that I haven't seen anythign like that in quite some time, it was amazing and one of my all time favorite action scenes for teh amoutn of stuff going on, as well as the inventiveness of it.<br />There wre points where the soundtrack was annoying loud and brash but it does really work well with the film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Island isnt that place I'd wanna go too.....this movie is so-so"></head><body><p>Ewan McGregor (Star Wars Episode: Revenge Of The Sith, Robots) stars as Lincoln Six Echo who lives in a word in the future where the men and women are seperated from one another, they cant feel any emotions with each other because the too hot too trot meter will bust. Sean Bean (National Treasure, GoldenEye) stars as the good doctor who is in charge of the whole thing. They men and women enter a lottery in which if they win they go to the island. McGregor becomes curious of everything around him and thats when he finds out the awful truth, that there is no island, that everyone he knows, even him and his friend Jordan Two Delta, played by the lovely Scarlett Johansson (Lost In Translation, Ghost World), are all clones of real people. So, the 2 of them hop on out of into the real world in search of answers and the real Lincoln and Jordan. Interesting premise with Michael Bay on the gun and so you get a big summer block buster movie which is half story and half action with the lead cast running around screaming "Run" Go". Also starring Djimon Hounsou (Constantine, In America), Kim Coates (Hostage, Black Hawk Down), Michael Clarke Duncan (A Night At The Roxbury, Armageddon) and Steve Buscemi (Ghost World, 28 Days). Sean Bean is in another role that consists of Sean Bean here and he needs to stop for awhile picking these kind of roles. McGregor  is always good and Scarlett Johansson is hot in this movie, I wouldnt mind going out with her. The action sometimes is good but it kinda gets boring after awhile. So say the least, it was a good try and effort for Bay to do but he kinda does the same pattern here like all the rest of his action movies.</p></body></html>

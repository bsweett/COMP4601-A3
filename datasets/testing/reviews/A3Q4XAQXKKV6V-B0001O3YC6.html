<meta name="summary" content="This hybrid runs on Diesel"></head><body><p>I really like this movie - A LOT. Very strong leads and a compelling main story mixed with a lot of nuance (Johns the druggie, Fry trying to ditch the crew, slight religious over tones.. etc).. about all this movie needed was an alien species a little less generic and a stronger secondary cast. However, I give this movie high marks for what it is and cannot fathom how they got that fantasy hybrid mess of a sequel from this hidden gem. See Pitch Black, skip the god awful sequel.. this is Diesels best movie and best character, not to mention a very nice high definition transfer and plenty of extras, hopefully if there is a third movie they go back to the grittiness of what makes this movie shine.<br /><br />8.5/10</p></body></html>

It's decently-paced, well-acted, and fun.<br /><br />Jeff Talley (Bruce Willis) was the chief hostage negotiator for the LAPD before a hostage situation went horribly wrong under his command. He got out of the big-city life and took a job as the chief of police in a quiet town far away from the hustle and bustle. When a trio of ne'er-do-wells attempt to stael an SUV and end up barricaded inside the owner's house, Talley immediately calls in his old colleagues. The problem is, the family's father is involved in some shady dealings, and his pals tell Talley in no uncertain terms that he needs to take over and get their aims met before anything else happens.<br /><br />There's no big plot twists, no big subtexts, just straightforward action-adventure. All well and good, or would be if Siri hadn't decided to get a little arty on us at the end; we're left with one huge question (the defense of which would be, I'm sure, "the answer doesn't matter") that keeps nagging after the last reel has long been played. Well, perhaps not too long; Hostage is an empty-calories movie, and you're going to forget you were nagged by it after a few days.<br /><br />Fun enough. ***</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tremendously Deep With Many Layers Of Dramatic Construction"></head><body><p>The single most accurate film about Hawaii that I've ever seen. Bar none. And I'm still stunned.<br /><br />Too often the portrayal, without malice, falsely depicts some kind of wondrous, spiritual and exotic locale. It's not. Not really, or at least not entirely. It's a state in the Union Of The United States. No better or worse than any other of the other 49, notable only for the fact that it's a series of islands sitting in the middle of a vast ocean. The film honestly depicts the congestion - of cars, pollution and people - and the shocking amount of concrete that is paving over much of what used to be "Old Hawaii". Clooney's character, Matthew King, opens with a prologue that includes, "Are...our cancers less fatal, our heartache less painful?". Exactly.<br /><br />It's a revelatory and moving film that successfully grasps subtle local themes and issues - many of which malahini won't understand. Not that any of that is an impediment to enjoying this amazing movie.<br /><br />However, here are a couple of examples:<br /><br />- The amalgamation of several prominent Missionary Families here in the islands represented by the fictional King clan. Some of which, like the film, are divided about their moral and legal obligations. A tarnished heritage that bestows great wealth to a select few, while simultaneously exposing their lost connection to the people and the 'aina. Often, carrying a blood lineage associated to Cooke, Bishop, Castle, etc., tends to foster a conflicted mixture of admiration, envy and anger amongst the people who actually live in Hawaii and call it home.<br /><br />Interestingly, the Kings, at least from my perspective, are likely a representation of the Sinclair-Robinsons. Their internal family debate in the 1990's, regarding stewardship of an entire island, sparked a statewide discussion about hereditary landholders and their relationship to the greater community.<br /><br />- Another aspect which I deeply appreciated: When Matt announces to a gathering of friends that he will follow his wife's wishes to be removed from life support - all of them are caucasian. It would've hollowed this film tremendously if Director Payne had attempted to display some shibai it's-a-small-world-after-all cosmopolitan show of skin colors to appease the politically correct. I'm grateful that it was honest.<br /><br />And honesty is what this film is all about. Whether it's the cultural rift between the haves and have-nots, and the racial divide that often represent the same groups. Or the tangled human relationships we have with one another, often repressing an ugliness we would rather not confront, 'Descendants' truly delves and explores these often sublime and gray issues.<br /><br />Tremendously deep, with so many layers of dramatic construction, it's almost indescribable without writing a thesis about the islands and our ohana. Every time you think you have it and the characters down, the story unexpectedly wheels and turns, and suddenly you're looking at a completely different film. Really, sincerely, this is a phenomenal movie.<br /><br />Absolutely five stars.<br /><br />Personal Notes:<br /><br />- Regarding Clooney - '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054PSY2W">O Brother, Where Art Thou?</a>' will always be my favorite performance of the man, but this comes so awfully close to topping it. His deilvery as an absentee-dad and distanced husband was about as complete a character as I've seen in a long time. Neither hero nor villain, but like most people, a mix of something in between.<br /><br />- Was enchanted by Shailene Woodley, who carried the difficult and critical role of daughter Alexandra King. And along with Saorise Ronan, an impressive young actress whom I'll be watching.<br /><br />- Wasn't sure who Alexander Payne was, so in doing an IMDb reference check, I realized that I had indeed screened an earlier work. As I think back on it, I wasn't particularly impressed with '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007TKOAA">Sideways</a>', but I wonder now if I misjudged the film. Based on the incredible detail he captured in this film, and given that I'm not familiar with California wine country, I'll have to set time aside to rescreen that earlier production.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not only the best movie of 2007, but one of the best films EVER!"></head><body><p>Juno is a masterpiece; there really is no other way for me to put it. It is, at the same time, one of the most witty films, fun, and emotionally draining films made within recent memory. How is it possible NOT to like this film? Everything about it is done with such heart, honesty, and realism that every second glows and shines with brilliance. Along with the great film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FVQM2Y">Brick</a>, Juno is probably THE best independent film ever made (well, at least that I've seen).<br /><br />The story starts out with Juno, a likable, sarcastic, awkward high school teen who has just discovered that she is pregnant. She decides, instead of having an abortion, to have the baby and give it up for adoption once it's born. She is far and away the best part of this film. The plot may be a little reminiscent of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TZJBPQ">Knocked Up (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a> but it doesn't rely on cheep comedy to drive film forward; instead it utilizes its extremely likable and believable characters in a way which sets this film above most others of its kind. Juno, her father, step mother, boyfriend, best friend, they all play a critical role in the film and present viewers with a realistic portrayal of everyday American life in a small town with nothing to do. Despite their obvious problems and character flaws, despite Juno's flippant remarks like calling her baby a "sea monkey" that she "needs to let cook in the oven (her womb) a little longer" before she can give it to the adoptive parents, they just become more and more likable as the film progresses. The relationships that are developed and elaborated upon during the film, in their subtle ways, build tension better than any action movie could ever do.<br /><br />If there is a movie in 2007 without a flaw, that film will be Juno. Not only one of the most quotable films I've ever seen, but one which captures the atmosphere of small town conflicts in a most realistic manner. Do not go into this film looking for deep hidden messages, unique film techniques, or dramatic over acting; simply enjoy it for what it is, a slice of life in a small town. Why on earth did I decide to see Rambo 4 in theaters instead of seeing this gem of a film?<br /><br />Replay value; VERY high.</p></body></html>

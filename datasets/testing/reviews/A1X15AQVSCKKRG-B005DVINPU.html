Michael Keaton<br /><br />was perhaps at his publicized peak as an actor. He delivered<br /><br />a good deal performance as Batman. Kim Basinger was<br /><br />also good as Vicki Vale. Jack Nicholson as only Jack can do<br /><br />was on fire and always knows how to be the in your face<br /><br />pyscho villian.<br /><br />Tim Burton's direction was right on, effective, mischevious<br /><br />and alert. Burton's magic touch at this point in his career<br /><br />was self evident, way before such flops such as Planet<br /><br />of the Apes.<br /><br />The action was well done with special effects, and you got<br /><br />to love the whole new darker and gruesome tone than the original<br /><br />Adam West serial.<br /><br />As Roger Ebert says, thumbs up.</p></body></html>

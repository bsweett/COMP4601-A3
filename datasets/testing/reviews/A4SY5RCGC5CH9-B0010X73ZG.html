<meta name="summary" content="An incredibly good, extremely shocking and very clever horror movie!"></head><body><p>I adore Stephen King books and I consider "Mist" as one of his masterpieces but to my great surprise and delight this adaptation by Frank Darabont actually IMPROVED the original story! And this is not an easy thing to improve the work of such a master! In fact many Stephen King works (including masterpieces) were wrecked once filmed (just consider the horrible fate of "Pet Sematary" or "Children of the Corn") - well not this time ladies and gentlemen! Here we have a work on the same level as in "Shawshank redemption" and "Green mile", which is only normal considering that Frank Darabont directed those movies too.<br /><br />I do not want to provide spoilers, but simply by looking at the cover of the DVD you already know that the mist is the key element of this story, and that the action will mostly take place in a supermarket - and also that for the people trapped inside, leaving the said supermarket is not really an option, because of the above mentioned mist... The rest is for you to discover...<br /><br />Any Constant Reader of Stephen King will probably howl with delight during the first scene of this movie - I certainly did! Also please do not miss the title of the newspaper one of the customers is reading in the waiting line in the supermarket just at the beginning of the movie - it is a very pleasant joke addressed to Constant Readers..)) I liked it very much.<br /><br />However the jokes and delights will end quickly. This is a VERY tough and extremely dark horror movie, with a great lot of death and suffering - including many of the most likable characters! And after all this comes the ending, which is as shocking as the crucial moments in "Seven" and "Shutter Island". It WILL shock you and probably hurt you - so beware and in fact if you feel a little bit down or vulnerable, you should absolutely postpone watching "The mist" until a better moment! That is a serious warning - please do not take it lightly!<br /><br />King's short story "The mist" had some elements which I always considered as weak spots and didn't like (although I absolutely love the whole story) and Frank Darabont made the choice of not correcting them, to stay faithful to the original text. I think he made a honorable choice, although King's obvious dislike of US armed forces is the only weak spot in this otherwise extraordinary story - me for one I simply refuse to believe that in a situation of extreme danger for civilians, highly trained professional soldiers (all volunteers!) who swore a solemn oath to protect the citizens of their republic from any danger, just abandon helpless women and children and choose the cowards way out! But this is just one minor glitch and after all stranger things happen...<br /><br />Frank Darabont changed however the original story by developing more the character of "the enemy inside" and especially by extending the story beyond the original ending, which was already shocking, but finally left the final fate of the heroes a mystery... In the movie there is a real ending and it is a very surprising and extremely painful one - it is even more horrible than any ending in Stephen King's books! But I believe this is a necessary thing, because this achieves the lesson we learn - and this movie in my perception is a very Christian one, unlike the original story. And here are the Christian teachings which I identified in "The mist":<br /><br />1) "Beware of false prophets who are like wolves coming dressed in sheep skins" (beginning and middle of the movie)<br />2) "Thou shalt never deliver God's children in sacrifice to Moloch!!" (second part of the movie)<br />3) The suicide is a deadly sin!!<br /><br />and last but not least!<br /><br />4) Hope is a major Christian virtue - so if you abandon yourself to despair, beware, because this is even worse than sin - IT IS AN ERROR!!<br /><br />This movie shocked me horribly but also made me think a lot and I count it as one of the best modern horror films and one of the finest cinematographic adaptations of Stephen King prose. I recommend it greatly - to buy, watch and keep!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THE  END"></head><body><p>I dont' feel comfortable when it comes to express an opinion about German director Oliver Hirschbiegel's DOWNFALL. I'm not German and I have the feeling that this film is mainly intended to a German audience. As for the facts described in DOWNFALL, I confess that I haven't enough studied these peculiar events to judge if the film is accurate or not. WWII and Adolf Hitler are still too close to me to let me judge with objectivity DOWNFALL. Furthermore, I'm sure that, like me, most of the reviewers here have members of their family still alive who can speak about Hitler and the horrors associated with National-Socialism.<br /><br />Now, if I consider DOWNFALL only as a cine film, such as John Wayne's ALAMO for instance in order to stay in the same film category, Oliver Hirschbiegel's film provides the kind of tension one can expect from a war movie. There are no heroes in the film, except maybe for the German people whom Hitler and his Generals are ready to sacrifice to their self-pride. And, most of all, Olivier Hirschbiegel doesn't find any excuses in the behavior of the last soldiers of the Third Reich. But, as I said before, Hitler's figure is still too close to us to let European directors shoot a Hollywood style movie about him. DOWNFALL is more than a documentary film but isn't still a mainstream movie.<br /><br />A DVD zone yesterday.</p></body></html>

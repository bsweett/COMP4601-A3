<meta name="summary" content="Difficult to be a woman among superheroes"></head><body><p>Superheroes have always been the object of a systematic cult in the USA. So sooner or later a woman had to come into the picture and since Supergirl never satisfied anyone, they had to look for someone else, someone a little bit more attractive. And since Spiderman had many long legs and arms blocking the way they had to look somewhere else farther out of the way. They looked in Egypt, they looked in China, they looked in the Middle Ages for an animal connected to women and who was both satanic and in relation with freedom, liberty and freewheeling. That's how the cat came out of the wizard's hat or bonnet. Catwoman was thus saved from the water of the river, which is absolutely accurate, and brought back to life in the human world of the night. She became the queen of the roofs. Then add a dishonest but successful industrialist exploiting women with beauty products that you must definitely not stop if you don't want to develop some strange Karposi syndrome or cancer. Then add his wife, an old belle who has aged faster than necessary and who wants to get rid of her husband and put her hands on the golden goose and the bank reserves before he finally realizes he does not need her anymore. And then you have the perfect thriller. A little bit of romance between the cop who is supposed to arrest Catwoman and the woman she is supposed to be and you have a heartbreaking story. But the poor Catwoman cannot stay because she is nothing but a living dead. So sadness takes over and she can only exist at night and on the roofs of the city. And there you have some kind of a myth of the cat seen as a symbol of ... what have I said already? But what's the meaning of this fable? Nothing is crystal clear in this tale, or if it is clear it is just as clear as black pudding juice at the bottom of a completely opaque wooden bottle. Only a cat can see anything in there. God bless the child.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></body></html>

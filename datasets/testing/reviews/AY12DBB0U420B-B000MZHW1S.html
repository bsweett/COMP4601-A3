<meta name="summary" content="Extreme Brutality, But A Well Done Movie."></head><body><p>Last night's bargain rack DVD for late night viewing was "Blood Diamond." I'd never heard of the movie but I bought it because it had a banner on the front that said it had five academy award nominations. I figured that it must be a good movie. Well, I can understand the nominations as it was very well done in a variety of ways.<br /><br />I didn't care for "Blood Diamond" and I'd advise people against watching it unless they have a high tolerance for extreme violence. Actually, I have nothing particularly against violence in films and I see a lot of it in action movies and the like which are more like cartoons than the real thing. But the violence in this film was from beginning to end and involved everyone including hapless women and children. This wasn't a fantasy cartoon. This was the real thing and my heart went out to the people of Sierra Leone and other places like it. Extreme brutality was everywhere. I have no idea what the body count of the dead and wounded might have been but I'd guess it was in the thousands, Did I mention the torture, personal degradation and the destruction of property? Death, destruction and mayhem were just an ongoing and integral part of the entire movie, and it had a point in that the control of diamond mining in a country undergoing civil strife was involved. Greed seemed to be the dominant emotion everywhere.<br /><br />The acting was quite good. The people, even the minor bit players, seemed real, unfortunately. The cinema was excellent and it was very interesting to see this part of Africa, except for the extreme ongoing violence. The movie was nicely paced and flowed along without any dull spots. I thought the story was contrived to make a bold statement against diamond mining, diamond smuggling and the diamond industry, in general. Well, I've never been a friend of the highly controlled diamond industry so it was good to see them take a little heat. They earned it. But to me, the total effect of the movie was negative. I ended up feeling as if I had watched a very well done and sophisticated piece of propaganda. When I see a good movie, I sometimes mull over it for the next few days. In this case, I find myself trying to get it out of my mind.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

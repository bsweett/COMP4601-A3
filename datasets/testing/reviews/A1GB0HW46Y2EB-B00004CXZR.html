The film has basically the same cast as the television series but was a high budget motion picture undertaking.  This is a very slow moving film which seems to last considerably longer than its 2:16  running time.  It shares certain similarities with earlier science-fiction theatrical films, notably Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968).<br /><br />To say that the acting is generally stiff in this film would be an understatement.  William Shatner embarrassingly overacts in this production to the extent that his character, Captain James Kirk, is thoroughly obnoxious through most of the film.  The story seems to be of a seemingly endless  journey through the Universe to reach a source of energy that is suspected to be a threat to the security of the earth.  The star ship Enterprise passes through strange formations and lights, reminding one of the psychedelic light-effects seen in "2001: A Space Odyssey" but taking much more time and having none of the artistry and imagination of the earlier film.  The ship finally passes through what can only be described as a galactic sphincter into a cosmic colon which contains this alien energy force which turns out to be SPOILER COMING UP! the space probe Voyager Six originally launched by NASA some 300 years prior to the time setting of the film.<br /><br />This is apparently the "Director's Edition" running  slightly longer than the original release.  The film, in Blu-ray, looks and sounds very impressive but must be, with one exception, judged from the standpoint of direction and acting as being significantly inferior to the five films having the same cast that would follow it.</p></body></html>

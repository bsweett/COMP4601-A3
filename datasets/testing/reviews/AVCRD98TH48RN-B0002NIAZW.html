<meta name="summary" content="The special effects are excellent; the story, passable."></head><body><p>Yes, this is yet another summer blockbuster disaster flick with an earth-shaking score and some rather amazing visual effects.  This film is director/writer/producer Roland Emmerich's baby, and he does give the film some lavish attention to production.  The story isn't too bad, even if it is absolutely unbelievable that the events that unfold happen all at once.  Roland Emmerich, who's best film is still "Stargate," but is mostly remembered for his mega-plex phenomenon, "Independence Day," very nearly gets extra bases for "The Day After Tomorrow."  However, the acting is wooden; the characters, two-dimensional.  I could actually see myself watching this film again someday on a rainy afternoon, too feverish to care about acting or the story's plausibility; just soaking up the dazzling special effects and trying to ignore the rest.  This is not a bad film, but it will be forgotten by next season.</p></body></html>

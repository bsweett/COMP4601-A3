<meta name="summary" content="Magnificently Entertaining. Excellent Movie. Five Stars!"></head><body><p>I found "Walk the Line" in the bargain bins at a nearby Wal-Mart. I snatched it up in an instant. "Walk the Line" was an acclaimed movie, the story of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. I particularly remembered Johnny Cash from his rise in the earliest days of what later became Rock 'n' Roll. He, along with Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley and several others were the star recording artists on the legendary Sun Records roster under the direction of Sam Phillips. This DVD will automatically become an important part of my music collection.<br /><br />It's an excellent movie! I can't emphasize this enough. Joaquin Phoenix and  Reese Witherspoon were outstanding in their depictions of Johnny and June, and they did their own singing! The music was quite good, perhaps not quite up to the original masters, but it was close. All of the other musical performers were outstanding. The movie was a period piece, of course, and the depiction of the 50s and 60s was very well done. I particularly liked the 50s. Everything looked absolutely authentic. The streets were lined with magnificently restored 50s and earlier cars, some of which I haven't seen for decades. Where did they get them all?<br /><br />The story was captivating. It recorded Johnny Cash's spectacular rise from being a failing door-to-door salesman, to a recording artist and up to a super-star in a very short period of time. Naturally, there's booze, drugs and women, not necessarily in that order, and there's the fall. It's a common story for rock 'n' rollers, but it's exceptionally well done here. And the story really got a good grip on the heart. This movie was magnificently entertaining, and if you liked the music, it's just heavenly. Five Stars!<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

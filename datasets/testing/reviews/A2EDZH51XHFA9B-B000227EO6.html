II of Kill Bill is not quite as good as the first (based both on reviews and its standing as I write in the IMDB top 250-- 93 as opposed to 58 for the first film). There is, of course, a vocal minority who violently disagrees. Allow me to add my voice to the minority.<br /><br />The main criticism of the second film, that it's not as well-paced, is well-taken. I think that would probably have been forgivable to more people if the film had been released as one piece; since I watched them back-to-back, I probably didn't feel the effect quite as acutely, either. Be that as it may, there is so very, very much to like about this film that I ended up liking it quite a bit better than vol. I.<br /><br />Michael Madsen plays insane, psychotic, extremely damaged characters in Quentin Tarantino films. (Anyone doubting this has never seen Reservoir Dogs, a movie Madsen's character stole right out from under at least four other Oscar-worthy performances.) He continues the trend of not only serious damage, but movie-stealing, in Kill Bill as Budd, a man who gets very little screen time given the duration of the film, but who has the most memorable character for all that. Madsen plays his character as a man of quiet malice who's gone to seed, but still sees himself as being a man of quiet malice. The part is written with the greatest complexity of any part in the film, and is played perfectly. Michael Madsen once again stamps himself as one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood, and it is he, for the most part, who makes vol. II a better production than the first flick.<br /><br />There are other things about the movie that really hit hard, too. Revealing any of them would be spoilers, but let's just say that Tarantino manages a real emotional response without having taken any of the Hollywood shortcuts to get there, and that alone in a Hollywood film should be enough to make the critics sit up and take notice. (To be fair, many of them did.) That a product like this could come out of Hollywood is almost enough to give this overly-cynical critic a shred of hope that, between Tarantino and the epidemic of Japanese horror film remakes making scads of dough, some moron sitting in a CEO's seat at some production company is going to say "you know, here's some solid evidence, finally, that the crap we put out is all wrong, and there's a market for really good films." Don't hold your breath, but Kill Bill, vol. II, at least put the idea in peoples' faces. Whether they see it or not is still to be seen. ****</p></body></html>

The 1973 original has Christopher Lee as a sinister,sensual Lord Summerisle... but in this version, respected ex-Mormon playwright Neil LaBute decides to turn "Wicker Man" into an allegory about male insecurities in the face of feminine power. The original was Christianity vs. paganism, resurrection vs. reincarnation, timeless in tackling issues such as sex education. But LaBute, usually known for his sardonic social commentary such as "In the Company of Men", goes back to oh-so-contemporary cliches.<br /><br />In the new "Wicker Man",Nicolas Cage learns from his ex-fiancee Willow that her daughter (he's supposed to be a virgin,so he's not the father) has gone missing. Cage ventures to the Pacific Northwest, finding Ellen Burstyn leading a matriarchal cult with Leelee Sobieski at her side. Since the cult is centered on honeybees, colony collapse disorder is a big deal,and demands the final sacrifice.<br /><br />The "Wicker Man" has unintentionally hilarious moments,MANY of them. Nicolas Cage freaks out,bellowing,"How did it get burned?" when he confronts the ex-fiancee. Or the scene where has a vision of a drowning girl. There's "STEP AWAY FROM THE BIKE!" Or Nicolas Cage running around the beehives. Or Cage running around in a bear outfit. The final sacrifice scenes are even funnier. He gets his legs broken a la Misery,and for some reason,bees poured onto his face. While the original Summerisle was all about the union of men and women (how very heteronormative,then again,Lord Summerisle does dance in drag),in the remake, Summerisle seems to be a matriarchal lesbian colony.<br /><br />From Cage's overwrought "acting" to the ludicrous premise, "Wicker Man" crashes and burns.</p></body></html>

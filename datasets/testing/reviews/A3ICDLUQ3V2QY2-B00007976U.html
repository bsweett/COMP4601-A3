Some people you probably don't much like get humiliated, but nobody even gets physically hurt in writer-director Mark Romanek's &quot;One Hour Photo.&quot;  What happens is far worse--their faith in humanity is shattered.<p>The story is simple.  Photo finisher Seymour &quot;Sy the Photo Guy&quot; Parrish (Robin Williams) has a problem dividing reality from fantasy, and he imagines himself joining the photogenic Yorkin family, who trust him to develop their pictures.  As he drifts further and further into this imaginary world, he starts visiting young, naive Jake Yorkin (Dylan Smith) at soccer practice.  He engineers ways to run into pretty, empathic Nina Yorkin (Connie Neilsen) at the mall.  He strikes up random conversations with affluent, ambiguous Will Yorkin (Michael Vartan).  But he's so affable and unprepossessing that they all fail to notice anything out of the ordinary.<p>Then Parrish finds out the dream world he's built for himself based on their pictures isn't picture-perfect.<p>This film is a wonderful mystery, but from the beginning we know whodunnit and to whom.  What we seek to uncover is the motive, which is as elusive as a fresh, wet, slick photograph right up to the very end.  And even that end, with its powerful &quot;Lady or the Tiger&quot; lack of resolution, leaves us with more to figure out than what's been explained.<p>This movie is going to be hard for a lot of people to watch.  Its careful pace and distinct atmospherics require viewers to meet the movie on its terms.  The dense plot demands much stricter attention than audiences are accustomed to these days.  And the style of themes seem drawn more from the world of literature than typical films.<p>For lovers of literary mystery and art-house cinema, this is one of the strongest movies of recent years.  Many will balk at it, but this risky, esoteric film wasn't meant for them.  The complex, sophisticated structure rewards book-readers as much as cineastes.  And if you're both of those, this kind of movie is what you've wanted, and haven't seen, for years.</p></body></html>

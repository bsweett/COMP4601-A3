Daredevil is not one of those movies. I was surprised to see that DD was entertaining from start to finish. Keep in mind that I'm hardly a comic book freak, in fact I've never read a comic book in my life. A sin perhaps..but oh well. It didn't stop me from enjoying the cool characters and style of this comic book turned film. Ben Affleck was surprisingly effective playing a super hero. I didn't picture it at first. He plays the title role. And causes no room for complain here. Colin Farrell plays the villian Bullseye. And although he wasn't on screen as much as you might think, he was quite a presence when he was. Now Jennifer Garner was a scene stealer as Elektra. She was worth the price of addmission alone. Rounding out the immpessive cast is Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin. I've heard others say he's about as scary as a giant teddybear. Well he is a great actor in my opionion and I thought he played the role very well. Once again not on screen as much as I expected. The main thing that DD does right is that the hero is the main focus like he should be. One complain about the Batman films was that the villians always outshined and over shadow'd the hero. That's not the case with Daredevil. FINAL WORDS: DD is an excellent action adventure film that can be enjoyed by old fans and new ones.  ..MOVIEBUFFS: Look for Kevin Smith in a cameo.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Meet The Fockers"></head><body><p>Poor Gaylord Focker (Stiller).You would think that after meeting his fiancee's parents, Jack (DeNiro) and Dina Byrnes (Danner), and barely surviving, he would be in the clear.  Wrong.  Now, the Byrnses are coming to meet father and mother Focker, Bernie (Hoffman) and Roz (Streisand).  To call the excentric might be an understatement, and Jack is his usual uptight self.  And, of course, that means that Greg's life is about to become hellish once again.<br /><br />"Meet The Fockers" is the sequel to the popular "Meet The Parents" that was released a few years ago.  Following the same formula, "Fockers" puts Greg in one uncomfortable situation after another as the parents meet.  All the principals from the first film are back, along with Hoffman and Streisand as the Fockers.  Both do a good job as the quirky parents that must have made poor Greg's life interesting as a child.  Hoffman is the standout in this movie, I think.  He is probably the most likeable of all the parents, and is genuinely funny almost every time he is on screen.<br /><br />If you liked "Meet The Parents", you will like "Meet The Fockers".  Simple as that.  If you didn't, then stay away.  This is more of the same, and for the most part it works.  When it is funny, it can be extremely funny.  Hopefully, now that Greg has survived this second meeting, his life will less stressful.  He deserves it!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A witty, touching, fulfilling movie"></head><body><p>Danny is a loving husband and struggling businessman, hoping to regain his feet after being fired.  On a business trip to Mexico, he meets an interesting stranger in the hotel bar, a man named Julian...who happens to be a burned-out assassin.  As the two become friends, things become complicated, as Julian becomes more and more unreliable; and soon, the two friends will have to work together to save Julian's life...AND their friendship...<br /><br />"The Matador" is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen lately.  Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, and Hope Davis all give outstanding performances; the writing is crisp and clever, the pace fast, the dialogue believable, the characters genuinely likeable and relatable.  Rarely does a movie this engaging come along.  "The Matador" is a uniquely touching, witty, suspenseful movie that--thanks in large part to brilliant acting performances and an interesting concept--draws its viewers in and doesn't let them go until the final credit crosses the screen.</p></body></html>

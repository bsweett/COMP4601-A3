<meta name="summary" content="A tale of obsession and revenge"></head><body><p>Set in Victorian era London and Colorado Springs, The Prestige is a story about two magicians/illusionists hell-bent on destroying each others' careers and, ultimately, their lives.  The movie is very captivating but entirely implausible.  Perhaps others do not have this same hang up, but it was hard for me to suspend belief that amazing technical advances -- that cannot be done today -- took place  a century ago.  There are many twists and turns in the plot, but each one is pretty easy to figure out before the "prestige" is revealed.<br /><br />Despite its implausibility and opaque "twists," it's an enjoyable film.  I've noticed over the years that Hollywood seems to put out movies on themes in bunches (e.g. Viet Nam movies in the 80's, tornado movies in the 90's etc.) and The Prestige's counterpart is The Illusionist.  Both stories use "magic" as a plot device; both are really about revenge and getting away with murder.  The Prestige is the better of the two sister films.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE picture!"></head><body><p>I am a horror buff. I've seen it all, from start to finish, and believe me, Horror - that is to say, true horror, is one of the genres I live for. To feel real fear wrought by filmmakers is one of the pleasures of my life.<br /><br />Up until the year 2000, the original Tobe Hooper version of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' was actually banned here in Ireland - along with 'The Exorcist' and several other seminal classic Horror movies - so, upon its cinematic re-release in those heady days when there was no such thing as a multi-region VCR, I snapped up a ticket and was mesmerised, far more so than I was by 'The Exorcist' (released here around the same time), by the actual fear and sense of melancholic terror it inspired.<br /><br />When I heard they were remaking it, I was duly fearful - for when has a remake ever passed muster with anyone apart from the most superficial of moviegoers? - but when I heard that the new version was going to be a different take on the original, keeping the same basic premise and little else, I relaxed somewhat. At least they weren't going to destroy the Original, rather build a new picture loosely based on the same plotline.<br /><br />There was hope, I thought.<br /><br />Now I see how truly wrong I was.<br /><br />The first and major problem with the new 'Massacre' is that the direction is truly appalling. It is unsuitable, it is disjointed and it does not belong to a movie of this nature. In this day and age where it's nigh-on impossible to scare the moviegoing public anymore, why hack-director Marcus Nispel has merrily employed EVERY SINGLE LAST DIRECTORIAL CLICHE known to man is a question that will forever mystify me. Gratuitous nipple-shot? Check. Token trapped-in-a-closet shot? Several of them. Check. Excessive gore? Check. Bad strobe lighting? Check. Zoom-on-characher's-face-right-before-a-shock? Check. And yet, all of this would be forgivable if only Nispel had actually tried to create some sort of visual charisma with his cameras. Sadly, he has not, and what we are left with is a visual motif which has more in common with an action-blockbuster than it does with an isolated no-way-out horror tale. Extremely ill-fitting, the direction and Nispel himself prove to us all that Hollywood Stereotypes, sadly, must exist for a reason.<br /><br />The cast is, as are most of the casts of contemporary horror movies, totally forgettable. No one performance stands out, nobody has any decent, strong dialogue or developmental scenes, but this is not due to any lack of talent on the cast's part - rather, a thoughtless script that allows no room for the generation of character sympathy. They might well be a bunch of Central Casting Rejects lacking even the briefest of acquaintancships with Acting, but thanks to a lousy script, we just can't tell.<br /><br />Similarly poor is the execution of the 'NEW' ideas and scenes. Sound and all as they are (the inclusion of the Meat factory and extended Leatherface family are both excellent ideas, in theory), because of poor direction, absent characterisation and VERY run-of-the-mill action, they end up as being just another way to fill ten minutes before the obligatory 1.5 hours are up.<br /><br />And sadly, that's the lasting impression left on me by the new version of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. It could have been so good, but principally thanks to talentless direction and bored-looking actors, it never once manages to get off the ground, or hold its own as a Film.<br /><br />And when compared to the original, it's a laughable piece of Nothing.<br /><br />Avoid!! Avoid like the Man with the Chainsaw!</p></body></html>

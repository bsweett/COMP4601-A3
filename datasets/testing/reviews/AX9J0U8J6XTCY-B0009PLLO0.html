<meta name="summary" content="SUPERB, UTTERLY LITERATE SPECTACLE..........."></head><body><p>WELL, MOST OF MY FRIENDS HERE AS WELL AS 90 % OF THE SO CALLED CRITICS TORE THIS FILM SO TO SHREDS, THERE WAS NO WAY TO EVER STITCH IT BACK TOGETHER! WELL, AS A CURIOUSITY PURCHASE, TO SEE JUST HOW AWFUL THIS FILM WAS, I JUST WATCHED THE NEW DIRECTOR'S CUT-I WAS DUMBFOUNDED! THE ACTING, THE LITERACY OF THE SCREENPLAY, THE ACTING, THE TONED DOWN HOMOPHOBIA, ETC. ALL ADDED UP TO ALMOST 3 HOURS OF NEAR BRILLIANCE AND MAGNIFICENCE! I DID NOT REALLY THINK  OLIVER STONE COULD EVER MAKE SUCH A POOR FILM AS CLAIMED BY SO MANY OF YOU HERE! WATCH IT AGAIN- IT IS HISTORICAL TO A POINT, AND REALLY BREATHTAKING TO WATCH! EVEN THE SCORE, BY VANGELIS, IS AWESOME. IN SHORT, WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO LAUGH AT, MADE ME LAUGH AT ME INSTEAD. IT COULD BECOME A SCREEN CLASSIC AS THE NEXT FEW YEARS PASS BY-YOU WANT STUPID, DULL, BORING, LOUSY ACTING? TRY DUKES OF HAZARD. ALEXANDER, THE DIRECTOR'S CUT, IS A MARVEL TO BEHOLD, AND WETHER OR NOT I STAND ALONE HERE, THAT'S HOW I FEEL-I LOVED IT.</p></body></html>

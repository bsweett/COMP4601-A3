<meta name="summary" content="Good film but Best Picture? Well..."></head><body><p>I tend to notice a pattern when it comes down to Oscar winners. For every film that deserves to win such as Return of the King and Titanic and Schindler's List, we get films that oddly win like American Beauty, Chicago, Shakespeare in Love and this one. Not saying that this is a bad film(the other 2 are however) but I like it going how did this win the entire thing? I wasn't a fan of the way too overdramatic Mystic River but with this film it's good but I wouldn't say it's Best Picture worthy like Braveheart or Titanic but it's good.<br /><br />Frankie Dunn is a boxing manager training a Title bout contender. Only before the match, the fighter ditches him for someone else and wins. In walks in Maggie Fitzgerald, an early 30s waitress who wants to be a fighter only Frankie won't teach her but with the help of Frankie's friend and ex-boxer Eddie she goes on her way to the top only to hit a really big snag.<br /><br />Like I said, this won Best Picture so I watched it after the fact it won and I don't see how it won. Similar to A Beautiful Mind or American Beauty, a film wins the big award while more deserving didn't get it like Saving Private Ryan over Shakespeare or Gladiator over Crouching Tiger. Guess I'm just not getting the big deal.<br /><br />One problem that really plagued Mystic River was it was too overdramatic. It was almost like the film kept asking you whether you were crying or emotionally moved yet. With this film however it doesn't have that which was a plus such as the last scene with boxer/trainer. And kudos for having Maggie tell off her leech family members.<br /><br />The film does have some issues though such as the wannabe pipsqueak boxer Danger. It just seems like a break from all the dramatic stuff by adding some humor but it doesn't fit. Same with the reasons why Frankie isn't speaking with his daughter anymore. While it does leave his character even more alone and broken at the end, why bother putting it in in the first place if you're not going to resolve it. Even Eddie's 110th final bout gets resolved. It's also a really dark film at nighttime with very bad lighting.<br /><br />Performances are one of its saving graces with them being likable people, even funny. Although I don't understand the attraction to Hilary Swank. Yeah her physicalness in the film's good but it's not like she was the best performance that year.<br /><br />I'd kind of recommend it although I have no idea why. I don't know whether to like it or call it overrated. Guess Oscar had the same problem I did.</p></body></html>

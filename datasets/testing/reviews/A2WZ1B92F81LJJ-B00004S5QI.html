<meta name="summary" content="It ain't a documentary - understand this, and you'll love it"></head><body><p>The bit a lot of people miss about Amadeus is not so much that it's a fiction (this really shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone: it purports to be the recounted story of a person in a madhouse, after all), but that it's an adaptation of a play. Like most playwrights, Peter Shaffer (he of Equus) was not interested in historical accuracy to documentary standard - and nor is this picture. In fact, it's much cleverer than that - what we get here is a beautifully scripted essay on Envy, God and your Just Deserts (and why you don't always get them), played out between light and dark in the beautiful setting of Prague. As befits a theatrical adaptation, the symbolism is stark - Mozart's white (even manifesting itself in a dove at one point, for heaven's sake) plays the establishment's black. For the most part, you can judge the sympathies of a given character at a point in time by the colour of his or her wig. Salieri, the great tormentor (and tormentee) is finally rendered head to toe in snowy white, being wheeled down the corridors of the madhouse, himself absolved and offering absolution to his fellow in-patients. And Mozart disappears, in a hessian sack, into a cloud of quicklime of the purest white.<p>I suppose the American accents shouldn't have grated - historically they're no less accurate than English ones, or the speaking of English at all, for that matter. Still, a pity that Simon Callow traded his English accent for a silly American one. <p>Good tip (especially for those stuffy types who don't dig Tom Hulce's hyena impersonation): watch the film with the alternative music only soundtrack. Sir Neville Marriner and the Academy of St Martins in the Fields playing Mozart to the accompaniment of pretty Czech snowscapes is about as it good as it gets.</p></body></html>

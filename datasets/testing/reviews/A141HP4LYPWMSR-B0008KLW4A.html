I'm sure the director Pitof would like to know.<br /><br />Positives: Halle Berry has one of the prettiest faces and figures in film today. You'll probably watch the movie from beginning to end for that reason alone. Benjamin Bratt is terrific as Tom Lone, police detective and love interest to Patience "Catwoman" Phillips and Frances Conroy (Ophelia) provides some much needed depth and occult mystery to the plot as the historian and guardian of the Egyptian Goddess Baast and the "Secret Society of Catwoman."<br /><br />Negatives: Sub-par special effects, silly plot and a little too much S&M motif in the choice of costume for my taste.</p></body></html>

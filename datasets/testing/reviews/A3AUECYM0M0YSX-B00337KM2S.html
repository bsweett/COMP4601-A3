<meta name="summary" content="That rarity of rarities these days, a smart film"></head><body><p>It's interesting that this film was being described as somewhat "dark" and "downbeat."  It's also interesting that a number of people here who have given it a low rating have done so, they say, because the central character does not go through an epiphany or "change" in any way at the end.  In fact he does go through an epiphany, he does change, but because the film does not telegraph this with semaphores, a lot of today's "weened-on-James-Cameron" film-goers didn't get it.  The film isn't exactly dark or downbeat, but it does have an ending that does not reach a concrete conclusion, that begs to continue its involvement with the audience member once he or she leaves the theater.  And that kind of finish--Clooney was told before he read the script that it had a "70s ending," for me always a good omen--is rare today where the main character has to be too good to be true and everything has to be wrapped up in a pink bow and placed gingerly in the audiences' lap before they leave or they feel "unsatisfied."  God help them they should ever see some Robert Altman.  Or Ingmar Bergman, Jean Renoir or Rainer Werner Fassbinder!<br /><br />George Clooney, who is a just about as perfect a blend of Cary Grant and Gregory Peck as you can get these days, plays, well, George Clooney.  Only this George Clooney spends his time jetting from company to company firing workers who are being downsized by management.  Some people have called him "unsympathetic" for firing people for a living, and loving it.  They miss the point that he is not doing the firing; he's being hired by the company that is doing the firing.  If he didn't do it, those employees would still get fired.  As he himself explains, "What we do here is brutal, but at least I do it with a certain dignity."  I don't view this as self-rationalization.  It's simply an unpleasant truth.<br /><br />I don't know if there really are companies that fire people this way, but if there are it strikes me as wasteful to send dozens of people all over the country when they could have a few with well-defined territories, sort of like in sales, so that many could conduct much of their business by car.  (Of course, with the high price of gasoline, I'm not 100% sure this would work out any better these days.)  Clooney plays the disengaged professional very well, and what I particularly liked about his relationship with Vera Farmiga is that we don't see abrupt changes but rather a gradual softening of his exterior.  The low-key script has him gently pushing her to advance their relationship, advances which she ignores or rebuffs *very* subtly.  With Farmiga's character he's met his match: she tells him to think of her as just like him, only with a vagina.  It's not a trap.  That's just what she is--and yet isn't.  The scene where we find out why it doesn't work is well-written and unexpected.  (Instead of a big, explosive emotional outburst, which I feel a less-skilled writer would have written, we get a very calculated, well-reasoned reaction from Farmiga, which fits in well with her character's hyper-intelligent, hyper-professional persona.  She's juggling so much that someone more emotional and impulsive would not be able to make it work, and either the writers or Farmiga or director Jason Reitman realized that.  On another note Farmiga's performance is the highlight of the film.  In the scenes where she interacts with Clooney, she is often leading and he is following.  She seemed totally unintimidated by his star stature, and never seems to be trying to command the scenes she's in, but she does.)  On the other end of things is Anna Kendrick's Natalie--young, enthusiastic, just out of Cornell and dying to impress.  I've met similar people myself, and Kendrick manages to make this deliberately narrow character grow, at least somewhat, while still keeping her essentially the same.  It's another great performance, though this may be a matter of great casting (Reitman wrote the part with her in mind) rather than great acting.  My favorite shot in the whole movie is of her on the peoplemover gliding silently away from us after she quits.<br /><br />What Up In the Air tells us--that we all need someone, that, as Clooney's character puts it, life's better with company--is hardly a revelation, but what is is the quiet way Reitman directs, Reitman and co-scribe Sheldon Turner write, and the principles act.  There are few scenes of high emotion in this film, and those that are there are played broadly, as comedy.  (I'm thinking mainly of the part where Natalie falls apart because her boyfriend leaves her.  There's also some "comic relief" in the form of some of the fired workers, believe it or not, many of them played by actual fired workers saying the real things they said when they found out they were terminated.)  It's nice to see a comedy that relies on a raised eyebrow or a voice inflection to advance the story instead of cars crashing, blondes taking pratfalls in their underwear, dogs chasing dinner guests into swimming pools, etc.  And that ending, in which nothing's changed and yet everything has changed, is pitch-perfect.<br /><br />It's still, when you get right down to it, a simple film about the importance of family and relationships, and it doesn't really break any new ground, the resolutions with the unemployed at the end are a little too pat and even disingenuous, but still, as one of its own advertisements states, this is the kind of film Hollywood has forgotten how to make.  Thirty years ago it made plenty of them.<br /><br />The DVD, as with most Paramount productions, is fairly bare-bones.  You get a commentary track from Reitman, Turner and a few others, and outtakes that helpfully have commentary from Reitman as to why they were axed.  (The third act originally had a much different arc--viewers will be very surprised how things were supposed to go--and a bizarre sequence with Clooney floating around in a spacesuit examining his life from above didn't make it in, wisely.)  There's a very brief bit on how computer magic was used to create the opening titles--of interest to After Effects nerds only, and something I wouldn't think the target audience for this movie would care about.  Finally you get two trailers.  All of this material is anamorphic, so you don't have to switch modes if you own an HD TV.</p></body></html>

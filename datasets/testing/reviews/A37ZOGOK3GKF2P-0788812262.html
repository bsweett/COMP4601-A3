The picture quality and new soundtrack in 5.1 is stunning.  A far better picture/sound than in the previous two issues.  I even watched disc 2, and I never watch the second disc.  It features one deleted song, and it was rather charming.  Other features include jumping to a song, or just watching all the songs with optional subtitles.  This is a great feature if you are trying to teach your kids those wonderful, loving songs.  This is one of the best discs Disney has ever put out, and its about time that "Mary Poppins" gets the same treatment as any other "Vault Classic."</p></body></html>

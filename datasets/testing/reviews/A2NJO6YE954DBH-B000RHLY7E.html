<meta name="summary" content="Rod Zombie does everything different for his "House of 1,000 Corpses" sequel"></head><body><p>Time and time again we have seen sequels that try to capture the economic success of the original by rehashing the original story.  This is particularly true in the horror genre, where sometimes being different means a new twist Jason shows up instead of Mrs. Vorhees or Laurie turns out to be Michael's sister.  At the other end of the spectrum you can sometimes pull off an actual switch in genres, such as when the haunted-house in space movie "Alien" becomes the marines in space movie "Aliens."  But the second "Nightmare on Elm Street" movie showed a complete lack of understanding of what made the original work and even when they came up with a neat twist for the sequel to "The Blair Witch Project," they never got around to a story that would make it work.  All of this leads us to "The Devil's Reject," which is a sequel to Rod Zombie's "House of 1,000 Corpses."<br /><br />Now, "House of 1,000 Corpses" was Zombie's first film as a writer-director and it involved lots of gory special effects and a plot line that throws in everything and anything that he could come up with to either scare people or make them want to throw up.  But many of the most horrific moments flew by really fast and I became convinced that the movie really was the equivalent of a ride through a fun house.  The fact that there is just such a ride in the film, Captain Spaulding's "Murder Ride," reinforced the idea that this conclusion is a reasonable one.  Thinking about the movie only got in the way of what was happening, so you just watch the movie and attempt a post mortem afterwards.<br /><br />"The Devil's Rejects" is a sequel in the sense that it has the same characters and mostly the same actors.  Sid Haig is Captain Spaulding, Bill Moseley is Otis Driftwood, Sheri Moon is Baby, Matthew McGrory is Tiny, and the only change in the casting is that Leslie Easterbrook is now playing Mother Firefly instead of Karen Black.  For some reason Otis is a lot more restrained than he was in the original, but otherwise the group is the same group of homicidal maniacs as before.  The story takes place after the events of "House of 1,000 Corpses," but even more important is that most of the movie takes place away from that location after the initial scene, in which Sheriff Wydell (William Forsythe) and the cops lay siege to the place and capture one of the gang.  However, the rest get away and if you think laying low would be the smart thing to do under the circumstances then you clearly missed the life philosophy previously espoused by Otis.<br /><br />It is almost as if Zombie took to heart the criticism he received the first time around and went out of his way to do something as close to completely different as he could get away without breaking the connection between the two.  The sadism of the original usually accompanied off the wall lunacy and here it is more real world, which makes it more horrific because what is in this film could really happen and you can no longer distance yourself from the proceedings.  The future victims are not youngsters anymore, which is a big difference given the genre, and with this particular sheriff after we get to see if the titular characters can take it as well as they dish it out.  You can even say the differences is light night and day, because most of what happens here is when the sun is up, as if Zombie wants to show he does not need darkness and shadows to twist the guts of his audience..<br /><br />Zombie got started as a musician and there is a nice irony here in that instead of his own stuff he uses music from the 1970s to underscore what happens, from Elvin Bishop's "Fooled Around and Fell in Love" to Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Free Bird."  Again, it seems clear he is going out of his way to be different and if "House of 1,000 Corpses" was, at best, a homage to "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," then this 2005 film strikes me as owing something key to the likes of "Bonnie and Clyde" (or maybe "The Wild Bunch" given the western motifs).  Zombie's goal is to come up with shocking violence that is not gratuitous, and how much you "enjoy" (for lack of a better word) this film will depend on how well you think he does on that score.  Because there are scenes in this film that will upset you, which, it should be remembered, is an acceptable goal in a horror film.  If you are jaded by what passes for horror films and find yourself laughing at things like "Jeepers Creepers 2," then this is a film that has several scenes guaranteed to keep your from laughing.  Whether it is the performances or the characters that are compelling does not really matter because either way they are as compelling as a car wreck.  Given the status of the horror genre today, that would be a good thing.</p></body></html>

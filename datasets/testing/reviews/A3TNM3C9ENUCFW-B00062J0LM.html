Here playing Ben Marco, a captain (and now Major) in the US Army whose tactical unit were saved from being wiped out, by Sgt Raymond Shaw (Liev Shreiber) single handedly in Kuwait before Desert Storm, or so it would seem. Sounds straight forward, but the only problem is that Marco's unit have all since disappeared or suffered an untimely demise, and this accompanied with his strange dreams and flashbacks have led him on a one man mission to find the truth. The erstwhile saviour and hero Shaw, now riding on his heroic exploits is proudly sporting his medal of honour, and steered with political avarice by his State Senator mother (played brilliantly by Meryl Streep) is in the running to be the next Vice President. As the story unfolds we see a connection between Shaw, his mother and "Manchurian Global" a huge conglomerate simply reeking of political back dealing, corruption and outlawed scientific experiments in mind control, as Marco starts to fit the pieces of the jigsaw together. I'm not going to give the story away, because the movie actually does that on it's own about half way in, and tries but never really delivers on the suspense or credibility front, rather bumbling with a tepid predictability instead. Comparing this to the original (for those who have seen it) is interesting for the similarities. Both movies paint their villians well as almost insidious and faceless power figures, or puppet masters working behind the scenes, and ultimately wielding all the power, and if one had too choose, this version is probably more believable on paper. In the Sinatra movie it was of course the Communist Red Chinese (it was 1962 after all) and now it's a comparitive of virtually any modern powerful conglomerate. The movie was OK, but really had way too many improbable scenes for me. Another question I kept asking was why the villians were even tolerating the existence of Washingtons character in the first place, when he could have easily been made to "disappear" once he had begun to air the can of worms he had opened. Jon Voight has a nice Cameo as Senator Thomas Jordan who helps Marco, and one or two red herrings and twists help the picture hold your attention. All that said, 129 minutes is a bit long, and the constant flashbacks, and fade to black camera shots get a little tiresome. Washington is believably engaging as the paranoid shell shocked Major, and Schreiber also works hard to lift the film, but this is not something that will appear too near the top of either ones Resume I suspect. DVD extra's are standard, plus a featurette and commentary section. Unless you're a collecting fan renting is probably best advice. Enjoy</p></body></html>

Miss Wonderly visits the agency of "Spade and Archer" for help in rescuing her sister from Floyd Thursby. Miles Archer volunteers to take care of her. A late night phone call to Sam Spade tells of Archer's murder. Spade visits the scene, then returns home. The police show up to tell him Thursby was also killed. Archer's widow shows up to see Spade about the death, another complication. Miss Wonderly calls to see Spade and tells him a little more truth. Spade agrees to help her, but he needs more money. Back at the office Joel Cairo visits to offer a reward for providing a statuette of a black bird.<br /><br />Hammett's novels tell of the tricks of a private detective. Take a cab to an apartment house, enter, then leave by the back entrance to shake a tail. Spade returns to tell Bridget O'Shaughnessy (aka Miss Wonderly) about the visit from Joel Cairo; this upsets her. They meet at Spade's place, but the police show up for a surprise visit. Spade talks them out of being arrested. Then Spade visits a hotel to see Cairo and notices the young man who works for the Fat Man. Spade keeps gathering information from the people he meets. After meeting with Gutman (aka Fat Man) Spade feigns anger to create a crisis. This leads to another meeting and we learn about the value of the black bird. But Spade was doped by his drink; he is no longer needed to recover the black bird.<br /><br />This fast-paced adventure continues with no dull spots. The meeting in Spade's place brings out the facts previously hidden. Spade plays along with them to uncover the truth. But there is a hitch in their plans for great riches. Gutman quickly recovers from his disappointment and returns to his search for the imagined riches. But Spade has detected the truth about Archer's death, and can resolve the mystery and solve the crimes. This shocking ending was hinted at in prior scenes. One flaw in this story is the need for experienced crooks to be fooled by an enameled lead statuette. Or was this Hammett's view of the share owners of the 1920s? The film shows a long-gone America. Carrying a pistol was almost as common as smoking in public places. Most people walked. Technical considerations avoided the cable cars of Frisco. Those $1000 bills were about a year's pay for the average worker in 1929. They were abolished by Nixon's 1971 devaluation of the currency. Wouldn't they be useful today?<br /><br />This film made a leading man out of Humphrey Bogart; previously he played villains as in "High Sierra". Note how Spade studies each person as they tell their tales, like a hawk watching a dove. The Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver seems to be a symbol or clue to the murderer. It looks like a revolver, but is really a self-loading or automatic pistol. What you see is not what you get. Had Hammett thought of something more shocking that couldn't be written in those days? Note the right to keep and bear arms in San Francisco then.</p></body></html>

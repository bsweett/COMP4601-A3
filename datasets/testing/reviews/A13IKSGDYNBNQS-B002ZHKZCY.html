Matt Damon reprises his role as the ex-hitman with amnesia, this time framed for a CIA mission that goes wrong.<br /><br />The rest of the cast are good with the always reliable Brian Cox putting in another top class performance. Unlike say the Transporter movies there is an edge of realism that puts this movie in a different league from most Hollywood action films. That said most of us have no idea what is going on in the world of the CIA/MI6 etc, so whether this bares any relation to reality is I suppose irrelevent. However last year somebody was poisoned with a radioactive isotope in a London Hotel, so nothing seems that far fetched these days!<br /><br />This is a fast-paced and gripping film that will keep you well entertained for all of its 108mins.</p></body></html>

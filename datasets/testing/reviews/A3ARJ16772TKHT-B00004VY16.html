This is because they never let the fact that they can do fantastic things in CG distract them from crafting a fun action story with likable characters. The effects are sufficient for their purpose and do not distract.<br />That being said, the real draw here is the character of the movie. Not the characters on their own, though they are fun too. But the character of the movie. It aims to be a fun action adventure and it achieves that very nicely. There are a couple bits (primarily around a couple of the victims of the mummy's attacks and regeneration) that can be a bit disturbing to the very young, so just know that it earns its PG-13 rating. But beyond that, there is very little here that is particularly objectionable.<br />A fun ride that leaves you feeling good at the end.</p></body></html>

Reeves plays an architect who is having some hard times with his father. While Bullock plays a doctor, who is just moving on with her life. But, their lives seem to be connected with this glass lake house. Reeves is just moving into it, while Bullock just moved out from it. Somehow, the two of them manage to fine one another through some letters and began a correspondance.(Done by this magical mailbox). Which blooms into a romance of sorts. However, there is one problem. They are living two years apart. Reeves is in 2004 and Bullock in 2006. The romance somehow begins to really shape thier lives and in the process, which will lead them. To have a chance encounter, which will change their lives either for the good or the bad.</p></body></html>

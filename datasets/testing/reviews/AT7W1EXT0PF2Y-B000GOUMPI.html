<meta name="summary" content="Legend of the man-faced dog"></head><body><p>Ok. Anybody that's seen this movie knows about that scene at the end where there is this man in a dog/bear costume. It's the scariest scene in this movie or any other movie for that matter. Some reviewers, such as Howard Tuttleman assume that there was a lot of cut footage that explained the whole dog/man legend. I doubt it though. But the truth may be a lot more terrifying. There is a Scientology book by L. Ron Hubbard called the Creation of human ability. It is a book for high-ranking scientologists but you can find it on ebay sometimes. The cover of this book has...a man in a bear/dog costume. Just one problem this book was written long before the Shining was made. 1954. Just what the hell is going on here?! So I read the book but there is nothing about the man/bear/dog thing on the cover. Is this false advertisement, or is Hubbard trying to tell us something? Or perhaps the director of the shining is trying to tell us something. Maybe the guy just walked on the set that day in the cosutume and he is trying to tell us something. I don't know the answer but there is more to this man/bear/dog thing than people are letting on.</p></body></html>

It's not a bad movie, but it's not that great.  There are moments that are funny like the scene where the kid sticks his tongue on the lamp post in below freezing teperatures or the lead kid getting sent down the chute by Santa Claus.  Other than that, it's at best, an average movie that serves it's purpose for the holiday.  Good, but not Great!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Best Rambo Ever!"></head><body><p>Out of all the Rambo films this one tops them all.  Directed by Stallone, this one by far is the most intense of all.  It has more action the Rambo's I,II, and III combined.  If you are a fan of the genre it's a keeper.  I have to say Stallone knows what he's doing when he makes these action films. He has the proper balance of dialogue and action with a good script this time.  It took Stallone 30 years; however, I see a difference in the quality of the scripts he chooses to film. This one is more thought out and the movie has more depth than the earlier ones.</p></body></html>

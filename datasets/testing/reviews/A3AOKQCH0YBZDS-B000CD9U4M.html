<meta name="summary" content="Johnny Depp Is Perfect As Willy Wonka"></head><body><p>I read "Charlie & The Chocolate Factory" as a kid and even saw the Gene Wilder movie version of "Charlie & The Chocolate Factory" too....<br /><br />However, this version of "Charlie & The Chocolate Factory" takes the cake! Johnny Depp is a fabulous actor and am always amazed at how diverse his acting talents are. He does a superb job playing the role of Willy Wonka! It worth watching "Charlie & The Chocolate Factory" just for his performance alone!<br /><br />I loved the acting by all cast members, the special effects were done well, costuming and even the set design were fabulous too. The story was great too. It has been a number of years now since I've read the novel, "Charlie & The Chocolate Factory", so can't remember how closely the follows the book... If recollections serves me well, this movie version followed the book fairly well.<br /><br />I think this movie version of "Charlie & The Chocolate Factory" is well worth watching if you haven't seen it already!</p></body></html>

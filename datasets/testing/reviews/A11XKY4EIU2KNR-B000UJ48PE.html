<meta name="summary" content="Hostel 2 ROCKS!!!!!!"></head><body><p>The first Hostel had some mystery to it, until the last half hour, you were wondering what exactly was going on. Once you realize what this place was all about, then the terror sets in. For those who have travelled outside the US as much as I have, you know this movie has believability. Hostel II has no such mystery, after you have seen part one, you know what the Hunter's Club is all about. So with no mystery, where can you go? Deeper into the organization of course. Instead of three men, this time it is three women who are the hunted victims. To me, this just makes the film more interesting. Also, we discover the fate of our 'hero' in part one. His head is on display in a secret closet.<br /><br />As soon as you see the European woman make her appearance and ask "Did someone lose this iPod?", you figure she's in on it, when she takes the three Americans to the Hostel, there is no question. In this movie we now see what the creepy dude behind the counter does with those passports. He scans them and sends photos out to Hunting Club members, where they bid on them like a human eBay.<br /><br />My favorite scene is the killer who fancies herself to be Elizabeth Bathory, who kills the first American victim. The scene was as erotic as it was terrifying.<br /><br />In this movie we also follow the tracks of two American businessmen who travel to Slovakia for the kill. One is a gung-ho, cocaine snorting, big shot who is all for it, the other is a meek, nerdy guy who doesn't seem to be into it. But the tables turn and true colors show when the men are alone with their victims. Cokehead is all into it before he accidently cuts the head of the hot blond with a circular saw. He then realizes that he wants no part of this and attempts to leave. He is very nicely torn apart by killer dogs in the elevator. The nerd turns out to be the real psycho. He wants to kill someone because he cannot kill his wife. Unfortunately he is also incredibly stupid. The tables turn once again as the rich girl is now in control and nerd boy gets to have his penis cut off with a pair of scissors and watches it being eaten by a dog.<br /><br />Eurogirl gets hers in the end Marie Antoinette style when the Little Rascals from Hell set her up for rich girl's revenge.<br /><br />Like I said there is no mystery here, but for those who enjoyed the first movie, you will enjoy this one on a different label because you see who is in charge of the slaughter house and just how many people are invilved.</p></body></html>

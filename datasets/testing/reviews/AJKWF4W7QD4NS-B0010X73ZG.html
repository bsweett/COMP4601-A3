<meta name="summary" content="One of the best King adaptations ever"></head><body><p>Frank Darabont, the man who brought The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile to the big screen, adapts Stephen King once again with The Mist; which ranks as one of the very best adaptations of the horror author's works.  Thomas Jane (The Punisher, Deep Blue Sea) stars as David Drayton, a movie poster artist living in Maine who, along with his young son (Nathan Gamble) is trapped with other survivors in a supermarket when a mysterious, deadly mist rolls into town; with something even deadlier lurking inside the fog.  Making matters even worse are the biblical ramblings of Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), who believes this is a sign from God, and soon demands that sacrifices be made.  Combining old school horror, social commentary, monster-flavored shocks, and more commentary elements of religious fanatiscism; Frank Darabont has managed to craft a modern day horror classic that does not disappoint.  Jane gives one of the best performances of his career, and though Marcia Gay Harden's character doesn't get much sympathy, she is very effective in her role regardless.  With wonderful CGI creature, monster, and makeup effects from the good folks at KNB, a great cast that also includes Silent Hill's Laurie Holden, Toby Jones, Andre Braugher, William Sadler, Alexa Davalos, and Jeffrey DeMunn, and one of the most unforgettable and unsettling endings in a mainstream movie in recent memory; The Mist isn't only one of the best King adaptations ever filmed, but one of the best horror movies released in quite some time.  All in all, whether you are a King fan or just a horror fan in general, you should definitely see The Mist.  You will not regret it.</p></body></html>

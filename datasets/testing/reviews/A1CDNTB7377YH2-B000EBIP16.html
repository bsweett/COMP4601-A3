Four children living in WW II London are sent to live in the countryside by their mother to protect them from the frequent air raids.  They end up in a mansion on a huge estate.  The mansion has one room with nothing in it but an armoir.  The children use it to hide and are accidently transported to a fantasy world with talking animals and a witch that wants them dead.  They are forced to grow up fast if they hope to survive.<br /><br />The special effects are great and the witch is the most memorable since Margaret Hamiliton's Wicked Witch of the West!  The big battle scene rates up with the fights in the Lord of the Rings movies.  This is the best movie I have seen in 2005!</p></body></html>

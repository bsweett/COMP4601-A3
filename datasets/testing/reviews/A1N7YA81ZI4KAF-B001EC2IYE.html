It's in the same league as HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG and Eastwood's utterly dark MYSTIC RIVER all of whom were nominated for several OSCARS. I must admit I liked the movies listed above (as depressing as they were). The main difference between those films and MILLION DOLLAR BABY is that the earlier films do not depict their unpleasantness in so grotesque a manner. Being an ardent horror film fan I have to brutally state this film was more disturbing than alot of the more sinister films out right now.<br /><br />It is not inspiring.<br /><br />It is not pleasant.<br /><br />And for the most part, it is not much of a boxing movie.<br /><br />It is very difficult to talk about the contents of this film without giving anything away so out of respect for those of you who want to see this film, I will not discuss the film's plot. But be warned, if you are expecting a heart-warming and inspirational tale of love and triumph do not even attempt a view. This film was torture and it left me questioning why so many in the Hollywood establishment look upon these types of films as entertainment and why they love to be depressed so much.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood needs to cheer up. Thanks to him, I was depressed for an entire week and next time I want to see morbidly BAD things happen to extremely good people, I will watch TITANIC instead. At least I was expecting that one.<br /><br />This was as inspiring as an episode of JERRY SPRINGER.</p></body></html>

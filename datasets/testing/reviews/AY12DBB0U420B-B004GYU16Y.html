<meta name="summary" content="Amazing Stunts. Lots of Death And Destruction. Yaawwwnnnn!"></head><body><p>Last night's bargain-rack movie was "Salt" starring Angelina Jolie. I found it on the five-dollar rack at Wal-Mart. I watched the director's cut. Well, it was one of these fast-moving, high-action, violent movies with little depth of thought. It's also one of these post-cold war movies where  Russia and America are still locked into the mutual destruction thing. Yaawwwnnnn!<br /><br />Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, supposedly and American girl who's parents were killed in a Russian car wreck. She returned to America and eventually worked her way into high levels of the CIA. But wait, she was originally brainwashed (trained) to be a sleeper agent for Russia and was awakened in the US by the capture of her trainer during a questioning period. Well, she then reverted back to her Russian training and become a potential assassinator of the president of the US. Well, this story had more twists and turns than the Mississippi River and I just lost interest in this bizarre  and impossible fantasy spy adventure. It's a high adventure action flick and some of the stunts are really amazing and will hold your attention. Likewise, there's a lot of bullets flying, death and destruction. Jolie plays a one-wonan destruction crew, and not too convincingly. It's an interesting twist, however.<br /><br />The movie is hard for me to rate. The story/script is nonsense. The acting is reasonably good. The sets and stunts are spectacular. It held my attention and was good entertainment. Would I watch it again? No.</p></body></html>

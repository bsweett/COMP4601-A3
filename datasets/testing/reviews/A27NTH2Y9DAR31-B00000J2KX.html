The little boy moving his finger and saying &quot;Redrum&quot; in that growly voice is also embarassing. Shelly Duvall was so obnoxious and whiny you almost wanted something to happen to her; not sympathetic at all, neither was the little boy. There were fleeting moments of tension and great photography, period. Another, later version, was far better than this, and stuck to King's original story, which needed no guilding/amplifying/re-creating. Nicholson's smarminess, Duvall's crying and whining, and the little boy with his &quot;redrum&quot; were enough to send me screaming fomr the room...not from the horror but from the embarassingly bad peformances, screenplay and direction. Love Kubrick, Dr. Strangelove is a masterpiece, but this one...well, I've already said it. Stephen King is a great writer; bring his stories to the screen as he wrote them! PLEASE! When other people try to change his books, the result is almost always catastrophically bad, case in point.</p></body></html>

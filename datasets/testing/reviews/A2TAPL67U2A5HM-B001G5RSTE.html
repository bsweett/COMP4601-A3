<meta name="summary" content="Madagascar (Widescreen Edition)"></head><body><p>Madagascar (Widescreen Edition)~ Stephen Apostolina is a good movie for people of all ages. The music is awesome, the plot is great with amazing charchters like the vain lion, the sickly giraffe, the adventerous zebra and many other animals. I love the penguins especially with their crazy antics. There is a lesson to be learned both for young and old. This lesson being that the grass is not greener on the other side. Then they make fun of such shows like survivor and movies like cast away. Even though I like this movie alot and find that it is grand fun it is still not even close to being on the same level as movies such as Finding Nemo or Lion King and I give it 4 out of stars which is not bad at all.

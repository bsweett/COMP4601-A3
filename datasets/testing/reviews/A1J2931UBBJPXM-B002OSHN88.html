<meta name="summary" content="A &quot;Classic&quot; In Every Sense"></head><body><p>A classic tale of suspense and intrigue set in post WWll Vienna, "The Third Man," directed by Carol Reed, stars Joseph Cotton and Orson Welles.  Looking for work, American pulp fiction novelist Holly Martins (Cotton) arrives in Vienna to accept a job he has been offered by his old friend, Harry Lime (Welles), who he has not seen in many years.  But Martins is greeted at his hotel-- not by Lime, as he had expected-- but with the news that Lime is dead, having been hit by a truck two days earlier.  Arriving in time for the funeral, where he takes note of those in attendance, Martins afterwards makes the acquaintance of a select few who knew and were involved with his old friend, Harry, beginning with a representative of the authorities, a certain Major Calloway (Trevor Howard).  Lime, it seems, was a wanted man, connected with some nefarious dealings on the black market.  Initially, Martins is skeptical, but it's only the beginning of the mystery that is about to unfold about him.<p> In talking with those who knew Lime best, especially those present at the time of the accident, Martins begins to notice some inconsistencies in their accounts of what happened that day.  And the one discrepancy that bothers him the most is that in the official report, two men were said to have carried Lime-- just after he was hit-- from the street to the sidewalk, still alive at that point; but an eyewitness Martins uncovers claims that, not only was Lime killed instantly, but that another man-- a third man-- helped carry him.  So the mystery begins; the report says two men were with him when he died, and heard his last words.  A reliable witness, however, puts someone else at the scene.  And Martins realizes that therein lies the key; that to find out what really happened to Harry, he must learn the identity of the third man.<p> Working from the exceptionally well written screenplay by Graham Greene, Reed rivals the best of Hitchcock with this richly textured, stylistic offering.  The mystery begins to mount with the opening narration (by Reed in the British version, by Cotton in the U.S.)-- delivered in a conversational tone that is in itself unique compared to the usual cinematic narrative form-- and the tension-filled suspense begins to build from the moment Martins arrives, and is maintained by Reed until the denouement.  And-- in a sense--beyond, right up until the final frame of the film.  Outstanding performances, combined with the stark black &amp; white photography (for which cinematographer Robert Krasker won an Oscar)-- enhanced by Reed's artistic handling of the camera and his use of light and shadows-- as well as the zither-driven score by Anton Karas, makes this one of the most memorable mysteries ever filmed.<p> Cotton delivers a brilliantly understated performance as Martins, which provides a solid foundation upon and around which the mystery surrounding Lime develops.  And though Lime is afforded little actual screen time as Martins assembles the bits and pieces he's uncovered through his investigation, his enigmatic presence is felt in every scene as if he were there.  When he does appear, Welles embodies him in such a way that the mystique of this man that has been so cleverly and acutely developed is effectively maintained.  Welles, in fact, with his naturally dominating countenance was the perfect choice to play Lime, and he certainly delivers.  His few scenes with Cotton, especially one that takes place on a ferris wheel (which offers a telling perspective into Lime's character), are the most memorable of the entire film.  <p> Cotton's performance, however, is the real thread that holds it all together, and as Martins, he demonstrates his generosity as an actor; for it's that "regular guy" persona with which he imbues his character, that insures the emergence of Welles' Lime as so larger-than-life.  The same can be said, as well, for the effectiveness with which the mystery of the woman in Lime's life, Anna (Alida Valli), is established.  Again, Martins becomes the sounding board through which Valli's character reverberates so convincingly.  Her performance is strong, but her interaction with Cotton allows her Anna to shine all the more brightly.  It's a perfect example of having all the elements that go into the making of a film working together to produce a true classic in every sense of the word.<p> The supporting cast includes Paul Horbiger (Porter), Ernst Deutsch (Kurtz), Erich Ponto (Dr. Winkel), Siegfried Breuer (Popescu), Hedwig Bleibtreu (Old Woman), Bernard Lee (Sergeant Paine) and Wilfrid Hyde-White (Crabbin).  Intelligently conceived and written, and imaginatively and creatively delivered, "The Third Man" is a masterpiece that works on every conceivable level.  The purity of the film is inspiring; the integrity of the story is never compromised in any way by the sensationalism or cheap gimmicks that seem to plague even the best of today's offerings-- the fact of which many contemporary filmmakers would be well advised to take notice.  In the final analysis, this is simply a truly exceptional film; one that belongs in the library of every serious collector.</p></body></html>

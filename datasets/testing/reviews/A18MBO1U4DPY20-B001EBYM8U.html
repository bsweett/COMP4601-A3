<meta name="summary" content="IS THIS WHAT AMERICA IS LIKE??"></head><body><p>I just finished watching it. I always thought Washington was the good man's good actor lacking that nerve and that bulge of testosterone. I thought American Gangster was the first time he did something with a shade of grey. How wrong was I? TRAINING DAY is truly one of the most absorbing, relentless, gutsy, powerful, powerful, upfront and non-boring action/drama movies I've seen.<br /><br />This film truly edges on it's morality. It is in it's own hemisphere. LA or Los Angeles is stunning. I'm tempted to think this is what is like or maybe it's just a film. I know in it's 2 hours - Training Day tried to show a certain half of a cop's life. Maybe all cops are this way and maybe they are not but I'm just left quite speechless at the perfromances.<br /><br />When the film started and the restaraunt scene hit me, I thought OK, This is interesting but soon just about every scene hits you when you're expecting. If someone falls asleep while watching this film, they must be nuts or on McDonalds.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke is brilliant. I don't know what happened to the man.<br /><br />The director is someone I've never heard of and I just searched the internet and found he's the same guy who did King Arthur and Tears of the sun. The latter I have not seen and the former's forgettable but I must get around to watching more films featuring the actor, the director and the same genre.<br /><br />I can clearly remember that the last film that shook me up just like training day did was a 2006 film that you clearly remember. And that was called "RUNNING SCARED"<br /><br />I'm not quite sure which one I liked more but that is the magic of the best films. It becomes difficult to compare.<br /><br />To those of you who haven't seen this film as of yet, guys and girls, men and madams......this is it. Look no further.<br /><br />MY Respect.</p></body></html>

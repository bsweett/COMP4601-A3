<meta name="summary" content="Beautifully filmed, could've been shorter, buy for extras"></head><body><p>I thought the movie was beautifuly filmed- amazingly detailed,but I think needed something more. I found the pacing to be very draggy at times, some segments could've been trimmed to speed it up a bit (the 20 min. of deleted footage on the extras might have helped the movie out by adding more interest?)<br />It might not sound like it but I do like Master And Commander and I'm thinking about buying my own copy.I'll be getting the 2 disc widescreen special edition for all of the extra's it contains because they sound really good, and will make it even more worth owning for not a lot more money.</p></body></html>

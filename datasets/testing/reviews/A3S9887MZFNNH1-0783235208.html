<meta name="summary" content="Cool film!"></head><body><p>I really liked this epic horror/action adventure. It had good acting, comical moments and some visually entertaining moments. Though many people can compare it with Indiana Jones (I can't as I've never endured those  films) and I think thats a bit unfair. I wasn't really impressed with the  CGI mummies because they did'nt look too realistic, but it is still an  enjoyable film.</p></body></html>

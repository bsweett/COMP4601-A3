While many noteworthy directors have been weary of the new format, some greats have embraced it and been eager to try it. James Cameron, not the inventor of 3D but certainly a recent innovator, upon seeing Hugo, called it the best use of 3D he'd seen. No matter what your thoughts on 3D may be, this is no small feat coming from this man. The film, based on the novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick and with a screenplay by John Logan, who also penned Scorsese's The Aviator, Hugo is largely billed as a family film but it's worth noting that the film's biggest fans will probably be adults, although there's enough whimsical fantasy to tug at the heartstrings of even the most jaded child.<br /><br />Hugo largely takes place in the early 1930s at a Paris railway station. Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is a young boy whose father (Jude Law), a clockmaker, dies suddenly in a fire. His alcoholic Uncle Claude (Ray Winstone) is responsible for maintaining the clocks at the railway station and teaches Hugo how to do so before taking an indefinite leave of absence. Hugo, left all alone, lives within the walls of the train station, maintaining the clocks, acquiring food by stealing, and spending his free time trying to fix the automaton his father left behind. The automaton is a mechanical man that, once wound up, is supposed to write; his father found it difficult to fix and it's Hugo's mission to see that it finally works. To successfully accomplish this goal, Hugo steals mechanical parts from a toyshop owner named Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), a callused, angry old man who eventually catches Hugo and steals his blueprints that guide him in fixing the automaton. Hopeless, Hugo befriends Isabelle (Chlo? Grace Moretz), Georges goddaughter, and begins to uncover the mystery of Papa Georges cinematic past. The film co-stars Sacha Baron Cohen as the feared Station inspector, who will happily whisk Hugo away to the orphanage if he catches him and Christopher Lee as a generous librarian who specializes in finding a good home for books.<br /><br />Hugo is without a doubt the most visual film that Scorsese has ever directed. Armed with a large budget, the film is heavy on CGI yet moves with the grace of a silent film. The production design by Dante Ferretti and the art direction, credited to ten people, is luxurious and Oscar-worthy, although I confess that it's hard to differentiate between reality and CGI at times. The look, among other things, is completely different from anything Scorsese has made before. The man that directed such gritty films as Mean Streets and Taxi Driver has had a much smoother style in recent years with films like The Departed and Shutter Island, but until now Scorsese has never made a movie that could truly be described as a visual feast for the eyes. As for the story, it's easy to see what made Scorsese respond so strongly to it but taken at face-value it's a rich, lovely fairy tale with shades of Charles Dickens. Of course, in true Scorsese fashion, it's also a history of and love letter to cinema with the importance of film preservation being a theme at the forefront of it all.<br /><br />The performances are great all around, striking and heartbreaking. Butterfield carries the emotional weight of the character well, while Moretz continues to establish herself as one of the best child actors working today. Kingsley delivers a performance that is, at first, cold but gradually turns to sympathetic. Cohen is quietly hilarious but brings genuine pathos to his role. It's a memorable performance that proves what a gifted actor he is and it's worthy of an Oscar-nomination, although if anyone is nominated it will likely be Kingsley and deservedly so.<br /><br />As Hugo is very much a cinematic love letter to early cinema, young children may be bored by it. It has enough magical imagery, but I'm not sure how successfully it could capture some people's ADD-riddled attention spans. It's one of the most classic-feeling modern films I've seen, which could be good or bad depending on your perspective. However, it's a joyous film that both children and adults should give a fair shake.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, Hugo is one of the best films of the year. Who else but Scorsese, well-known as such an incredibly passionate lover of film, could make such a wondrous film about the wonder of film? It's a celebration of all that cinema can be, as well as where cinema came from. It illustrates the progression between cinema being made of dreams to becoming the thing dreams are made of. It's amazing that a major studio would release this film at a time when major studios are largely considered creatively bankrupt. In making a film that celebrates early, silent cinema Scorsese seems to be winking at the audience by creating a film that could not exist without modern technology. Hugo is a perpetually heartwarming and smile-inducing film. Beautiful, not just aesthetically, it's a triumph of spirit; a soulful, magical masterpiece that actually brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />GRADE: A<br /><br />As for the 3D; I've always preferred to see 3D used as the gimmick that it is rather than seeing an attempt to be artistic with it. I was not impressed by James Cameron's Avatar and have only seen it used with true purpose in Herzog's Cave of Forgotten Dreams. Truth be told, I have not been particularly impressed with any use of it I've seen thus far. That changed with Hugo. Scorsese does not use it as a gimmick, but as a way to provide the film with an additional dimension and deepen one's immersion into the overall experience. Would this film still function as magically without it? Yes, it would. Does this use of 3D actually add something to the experience? Undoubtedly. While 3D is still not a fad that I'm particularly hip to, it's good to see a director trying to use it with purpose and actually succeeding.</p></body></html>

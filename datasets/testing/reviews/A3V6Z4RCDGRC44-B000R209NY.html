<meta name="summary" content="More Adventure, Less Drama than 1972 Version"></head><body><p>This remake from 2006 stars Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss. You've got an elegant cruise liner, a diverse cast of characters, and suddenly a rogue wave tips the whole thing over. Most of the survivors huddle in the main dining room - but a small group of passengers decide to make it out on their own.<br /><br />It's hard to judge this film just as a "stand alone disaster flick" since the 1972 version was so spectacular. It's sort of like if you really loved the Titanic with Leonardo - and then watched an action-adventure movie made now, that was half as long and truncated the characters. It would be really hard not to compare the two. So there are probably two types of watchers for this movie. One will be the people who saw the 1972 version and who are probably disappointed with this one as a result. On the other hand, people who watch this movie without any expectations, and just want a "wild ride for 1 1/2 hours" will find the special effects quite thrilling.<br /><br />Part of what this story is about is how a wide variety of characters - young boy, just-engaged couple, stowaway, older homosexual, etc. - manage to get over their issues and bond and get through troubles. Again if you're just looking for a "wild ride" won't care that these people are very stereotypical and cardboard cutout types. If you're actually a fan of drama movies where the characters grow and learn and reach into their inner strengths, you'll find this a poor version of that earlier film.<br /><br />On the other hand, part of any disaster movie is the excitement and reality of the disaster. A lava disaster movie seems hokey when they are running from "red water". When the lava is roiling, the heat waves are filling the screen and the smoke is thick, suddenly you can feel the panic and the danger. That is why we watch disaster movies - to watch people face dangers, and their fears, and hopefully rise above them. It gives us hope and encouragement that we might do the same.<br /><br />So while the 1972 version of Poseidon had some rather silly scenes of water and flood, this 2006 version does a GREAT job with many of the scenes. The way the water bursts through the windows, the way the ship is affected as it tilts upside down, it all feels very real. After the footage and experience of the Tsunami, it definitely feels real and scary to have a gigantic wave of water coming at you with nowhere to run to. You can also understand the panic of being in a submerged vessel that is sinking.<br /><br />There are numerous plot holes and factual errors, that if you're even half paying attention, make you lose your suspension of disbelief. I suppose it's that way with many disaster films - you have to just accept that they did things A and B even though doing C makes MUCH more sense to any sane person. Also, you would have thought that people working on a high budget film involving a ship would have made sure that all their basic research about how a ship works, how the ballast works, how the propeller works, etc. was correct.<br /><br />Still, in the end, you probably watch this film because it's a fun way to pass an hour and a half with your popcorn and soda. So in that sense, the movie suits that purpose, and is well worth a watch.</p></body></html>

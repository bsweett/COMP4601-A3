<meta name="summary" content="Lackluster blockbuster is even worse than the book"></head><body><p>Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman have done the impossible. They've take one of the dumbest books ever written and turned it into an even dumber film. I loathed the book but expected to enjoy the film, and for precisely the same reason: what Brown had written was not a novel but essentially a 400-page treatment for a Hollywood movie. But even with such promising raw material Howard and Goldsman have managed to screw it up. The fundamental problem here is one of tone. Rather than embracing the radiant absurdity of Dan Brown's storytelling, the entire film is suffused with a turgid tone of reverential self-importance. It's gloomy, heavy, dull; tediously solemn, laborious and cold. What it needed was the magic of a director like Spielberg who showed, with the "Raiders" trilogy, that you can deftly blend action, mystery and humour into a rollicking good time without losing any of the spine-tingling religiosity at the heart of this kind of story. But in Howard's hands, it tanks. Stripped of Brown's 100-odd chapter structure which almost guarantees a cliffhanger on every second page, the story drags. And nothing in Howard's style compensates. The camera work is lazy, the editing dull, the staging dark and uninteresting. Even the master of overblown melodrama, Hans Zimmer, sounds bored. The performances are similarly lackluster. Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou look constantly nervous - perhaps worried that Hanks' botox won't last the shoot. There's no chemistry between them, and not a single scene which would have allowed any to develop. Paul Bettany as Silas is less creepy than he is sad. Alfred Molina and Jean Reno are wasted in minor roles. Only Ian McKellen, as Sir Leigh Teabing the conniving cripple, manages to hit the note of inspired lunacy which, if grasped by Howard, might have made this an immensely enjoyable night out. As it stands, it ends up being amusing for all the wrong reasons - never more so than when it tries to hedge its bets with the Religious Right by having Langdon wonder aloud why Jesus couldn't have been a father as well as the Son of God. As if thinking Christians everywhere haven't been wondering that for centuries.</p></body></html>

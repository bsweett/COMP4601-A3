<meta name="summary" content="Coraline"></head><body><p>After Coraline (Dakota Fanning) and her parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) move to the Pink Palace Apartments, Coraline becomes frustrated by her lack of friends and her parents not paying attention to her as they work on their gardening catalog. When she runs into her neighbor Wybie (Robert Bailee Jr.), he gives her a doll he found in his grandmother's house that looks just like her. Shortly after receiving the doll Coraline finds a small door in the wall of their apartment that opens up to a brick wall. But later that night jumping mice who seemingly belong to upstairs neighbor, The Amazing Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane), lead her back to the door where she finds an alternate world where her parents treat her like she longs to be treated. Each night she revisits this wonderful world only to eventually find out that it's not all it's cracked up to be.<br /><br />It's often a preconceived misconception that Tim Burton directed A Nightmare Before Christmas. As much as Burton wanted to direct Nightmare, he was unfortunately too busy working on Batman Returns, and was forced to place Henry Selick in the director's chair. Since then, A Nightmare Before Christmas has become a classic, being played every year in limited release around the country. This time Selick takes on Neil Gaiman. Neil Gaiman has become a much revered science fiction/ fantasy writer having written such work as the novel Stardust, which was turned into a movie in 2007, and the comic book series The Sandman as well as Coraline. Writing stories that are uniquely original with his comics including visuals that are stunning and unique in their own right, Gaiman is the perfect writer to bring to the big screen. And if you're considering using stop motion animation there are few directors other than Selick that one can think of to bring Gaiman's work to the big screen with it's integrity intact.<br /><br />After seeing Coraline, I have to say that I can't think of any other filmmaker other than Tim Burton that could have done this movie justice. The attention to detail, as it was with Nightmare, is meticulous. I generally have a little problem with not being able to completely escape reality when watching a stop-motion animation film, but with Coraline I didn't have much of a problem with that. With too much of this style of animation the director seems scared to make things dirty, gritty, and real, but Selick doesn't seem to have that much of a problem in this movie. That really aids this film as the real world Coraline lives in is a gritty world to her as opposed to the alternate reality she visits and, at first, prefers to her real life. The writing is, for the most part, impeccable despite a few clunky lines, crafting a unique story with characters that you feel for and are compelled to root for when their situations go awry.<br /><br />Of course, with any animated movie the characters are only as good as the people who voice them. Here you have some great actors such as Dakota Fanning (War of the Worlds, Man on Fire, I Am Sam), Keith David (Crash, Requiem for a Dream, Pitch Black), and Ian McShane (Deadwood, Kings, Sexy Beast). The voice actor that really stands out, though, is Teri Hatcher as Coraline's mother Mel Jones. As Mel Jones, Teri Hatcher doesn't just play the real world mother, but also the alternate mother creating a world for Coraline, luring her in to steal her soul. As Mel, Hatcher really makes you feel both sides of the coin of the character. She makes you feel that the alternate mother is the best fit for Coraline, but when you find out the truth she makes you despise the other mother and feel for the mother that you at first despised. This mixture of emotions for one actress to make you convey shows the brilliance of the performance as well as the visuals used by the filmmakers in the story.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, later in the movie as Coraline searches for her parents and the souls of lost children the movie devolves into what feels like video game mode. The souls of the lost children speak to her as though she's a character played by the the director rather than feeling like an organic transition. This could have been a conscious decision by the filmmakers but it feels a little gimmicky. When I got to what I thought was going to be the end of the game that the other mother was playing with Coraline I honestly felt like I was playing a game of something like Mario approaching Bowser for the final battle. That would be great if I was playing Mario, but I don't want to be taken out of a movie with the feeling that I'm playing a game that I'm not really playing.<br /><br />In the end though, I fell in love with the world and plight of Coraline. I'm still not sure if I will own it, but I think it would hold up greatly in repeated viewings. I do recommend this movie, especially if you like stop motion animation, The Nightmare Before Christmas, or somewhat gothic styles movies. Selick did a great job of translating a Gaiman classic to the big screen creating a unique and original film. Before you show the kids I highly recommend that you watch it yourself. While this may be stop motion animation there are scenes that may be scarier than you'd like your kids to experience and one scene of an older woman in extremely skimpy clothing.<br /><br />4/5</p></body></html>

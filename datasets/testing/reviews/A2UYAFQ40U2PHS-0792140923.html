It just seemed like an excuse to play a lot of songs from the 1960's, and for baby boomers to reminisce about historical events in their lives (of which Gump was at all of them).  Why this won so many awards is highly questionable.  The only reason I can think of is that it's easy and not too controversial; it's the safe choice.  The Academy has been known to do that (remember the Crash and Brokeback Mountain controversy?).  Tom Hanks really didn't deserve an Academy Award here, not that he isn't a fine actor (he is), but because the performance is not particularly challenging.  It's a rather simple performance where he's just playing an "aw, shucks" kind of guy.  The special FX were really no big deal (even though the press told us they were), and look quite ordinary today.  Reportedly, the original novel was much more satritic and darker.  I should read it.  It's probably better than the film.</p></body></html>

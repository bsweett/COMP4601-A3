<meta name="summary" content="Bubba Ho-Tep"></head><body><p>Bubba Ho-Tep is based on a short story by Joe R. Lansdale featuring two main characters that are cultural icons and a mummy. Obviously, this is not your typical Hollywood movie. Bubba Ho-Tep is a movie with a beyond-minuscule budget that has gained quite a cult following over the last 6 years. I didn't love the movie, but I found it hard not to admire it.<br /><br />Bruce Campbell plays Elvis Presley, a resident at an East Texas nursing home. Of course, no one believes that he's Elvis because Elvis is dead. Years earlier, weary of fame, Elvis traded places with an impersonator under the condition that he could return to his real life whenever he wished. Unfortunately, all of his documentation was lost in a barbecue accident and now he's just a delusional old guy with a growth in a rather unfortunate area. Another resident is John F. Kennedy (the wonderful Ossie Davis) who claims his assassination was staged by Lyndon Johnson and he was dyed as a result. After scarab beetles are found wandering the nursing home, the two men discover that a soul-sucking Egyptian mummy is afoot.<br /><br />From it's opening title card (providing us with amusing definitions of both "bubba" & "Ho-tep") to it's final scene, Bubba Ho-Tep is a ridiculous, yet amusing B-movie.<br /><br />The film is directed by Don Coscarelli, better known for his four Phantasm films. Here, he's made a unique and meditative horror-comedy that, love it or hate it, is unlike anything you've ever seen.<br /><br />Calling it a horror-comedy isn't quite appropriate. This is a film that really struggles to fit into one particular genre, especially as it's not horrific enough to be a horror film nor is it funny enough to be a comedy.<br /><br />If it's story and execution doesn't appeal to your cinematic palette, it's hard not to appreciate Bruce Campbell's performance, as he completely disappears into his role as Elvis. Casting is pivotal in a movie like this and miscasting could've taken away all credibility from the film. Campbell doesn't just make you believe that he believes he's Elvis but that he IS Elvis.<br /><br />Bubba Ho-Tep is not perfect and how can it be? It has Elvis and JFK battling a mummy, but it has real talent both behind and in front of the camera. There certainly needs to be a substantial amount of suspended disbelief going into this movie to really enjoy it; but Bubba Ho-Tep is charming and completely unlike anything I've ever seen. I recommend it, but be aware of what you're getting yourself into.<br /><br />GRADE: B-</p></body></html>

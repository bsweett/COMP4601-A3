<meta name="summary" content="Unrealized potential"></head><body><p>It is unfortunate that Stanley Kubrick who has given us so many brilliant films ("Spartacus"; "2001, A Space Odyssey"; "A Clockwork Orange"; "The Shining"; "Full Metal Jacket"), should end his career with this one.  The  biggest problem with this film is the screenplay, which is all the more  perplexing since Kubrick helped write it.  It is hard to comprehend how  such a masterful filmmaker could miss the mark by such a wide margin.  <p>Let me begin by saying that the technical aspects of this film were  superb to the point of being superhuman.  Kubrick's camera work was pure  genius.  The color and lighting were impeccable; incomparable in their  impact and effect as well as their beauty.  Anyone who has seen this film  should go back and watch it again and just notice the way the sets are  lighted, how the shadows are cast, how the rooms in the background are  bathed in soft blue with contrasting colored lights perfectly splashed in  to heighten the effect.  As far as the sound, Kubrick can do more with the  well placed single note of a piano than most directors can do with an  entire orchestra.<p>That being said, the script can only be described as  grossly disappointing.  There were really two stories here.  The first is  the story of Bill (Tom Cruise) and Alice (Nicole Kidman) Harford's  relationship.  The second was the story of Bill's sexual odyssey resulting  in his crashing of an orgy for the rich and famous.  Too much was made of  the first and not enough of the second.  This should have been a  psycho-sexual film noir suspense thriller.  The elements were there for a  good one.  Bill's penetration of the sordid inner circle of sex games of  the powerful could have been a riveting thriller with proper follow  through.  But instead, Kubrick chose to deflate this storyline with the  unsatisfying dialogue between Bill and Victor (Sidney Pollack).  He then  returned to the Harford's relationship, which was a character study in "who  cares".  He ends the film as if their relationship was the point, which  left the film pointless.<p>Other than her ability to provide sexy set  dressing, Nicole Kidman was utterly superfluous in this film.  Worse yet,  this was probably the most wretched performance of her career.  Kidman is  not without talent and has given us some excellent performances ("Malice";  "Dead Calm").  Her performance here was tentative and strained, however.  There were times when she was so unnatural in the delivery of her lines,  one would have thought she was aphasic.<p>Tom Cruise gave an excellent  performance portraying a difficult and tormented character.  It was  somewhat of a departure for him to play a character that was so pent up and  emotionally torn.  He hasn't taken on a part this difficult since "Born On  The Fourth of July".  Usually he plays the straightforward macho type; more  action than depth.  I was pleasantly surprised by his ability to rise to  the challenge of this character's complexity.<p>I gave this film a 7/10.  The filmmaking was a 12, but the story was never developed to its full  potential.  It would have been interesting to see what Alfred Hitchcock  would have done with this story.  Perhaps Stanley and Alfred are talking  about that right now.</p></body></html>

That's what projects from this movie.<br /><br />It's a term labelling social fabric existing and yet masking a sense of disconnectedness and disorganization.<br /><br />The collaboration between Robert Altman and Garrison Keillor was so promising.  Two totally original, brilliant and creative people coming together on a project about something so beloved, so entrenched in our culture.<br /><br />The result hits some marks, to be sure:  the steadiness of midwestern people, the deadpan humor.  And then we get death, too, in the form of a beautiful trenchcoated woman.  And who knew that Meryl Streep was such a fantastic singer!<br /><br />When we finished watching it, my wife said, "Well, it's better than when William Shatner writes for himself."  Her perception is dead accurate.  The inevitable self-absorption of this effort is not quite as bad as William Shatner writing scripts for Captain Kirk.<br /><br />But it gets damn close.  I doubt we'll watch it again.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Silence of the Lambs"></head><body><p>Jonathan Demme's superb adaptation of Thomas Harris's petrifying page turner makes for an equally riveting, disturbing film. Foster is note-perfect as Starling, a driven but inexperienced operative struggling mightily not to appear both terrified and out of her depth. And Hopkins's seething, malevolent Lecter makes the knife-wielding Norman Bates in "Psycho" look like a boy scout. Ted Levine is also suitably deranged and bizarre as Buffalo Bill, adding further to the goose bump count. One of the more potent shockers out there, "Silence" is not for the squeamish, but those who can take it will love it. The film won a slew of major Oscars, including Picture, Actor, Actress- and earned them all.</p></body></html>

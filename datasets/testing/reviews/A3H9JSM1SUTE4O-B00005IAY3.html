<meta name="summary" content="ILLEGAL ALIEN PR"></head><body><p>Steven Spielberg's epic film that brainwashed the world into accepting alien invaders with open arms and a five-note melody arrives in a great looking two disc set that includes a fascinating new 102 minute "making-of" documentary and 10 deleted scenes.  The lush 137 minute widescreen transfer is apparently the third version of the film and is Spielberg's definitive version.  For now.  Rated PG.</p></body></html>

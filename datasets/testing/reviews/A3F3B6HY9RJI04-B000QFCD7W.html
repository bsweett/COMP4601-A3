I wasn't disappointed because not only is there a fun story but good acting a well-timed comedy that only these actors could pull off.<br /><br />This is the story of four city-slickers who go on a cross-country and back road trip on a couple of motorcycles to relive their glory days and hopefully put a little bit of energy back into their lives.  Of course, many mishaps happen along the way but things get really tough when they infuriate a biker gang called the Del Fuegos.  As expected, hilarity ensues.<br /><br />This may not be the funniest movie I've seen but it does have a lot of laugh-out-loud moments that I really enjoyed.  While the four actors listed above are fine performers, I really must take my hat off to William H. Macy who, I believe, stole the show.<br /><br />So, prepare yourselves for a while ride when you pick up this movie and enjoy a couple of hours with the Wild Hogs.  Make sure you watch the closing credits (the first several minutes of them anyways) because the twist they throw in at the end is hilarious.</p></body></html>

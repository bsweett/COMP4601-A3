<meta name="summary" content="A different kind of Rat Pack"></head><body><p>I enjoyed Ocean's Twelve.  I skipped Ocean's Eleven.  I heard good things about Ocean's Thirteen, so I downloaded it.<br /><br />Ocean's Thirteen is supposed to be better than Twelve; the characters are emotionally invested in the plot (as opposed to the first movie, where they were apparently needed the money, I guess) because this time they're out for revenge. Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould) invests in some properties only to have it forcibly taken from him in a move of Trumpian proportions by the nefarious Willie Bank (Al Pacino).  Poor Tishkoff suffers...a stroke? A broken heart?  Some kind of nondescript medical condition that leaves him bed-ridden? Our boys are loaded with cash, so it's just a matter of humiliating Bank, returning the property to Tishkoff, and making a quick buck in the process.<br /><br />The fact that they have to ally with Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) is supposed to make the movie even more hilarious.  But it doesn't matter, because our heroes take it in stride.  In fact, there's never a moment in the film when we actually feel like things might go sour.<br /><br />There's a lot of problems with Ocean's Thirteen, not the least of which is the superhero status of our Justice League of Swinging Hip Guys.  There's too many of them. They're all really rich at this point.  And it's hard to conceivably rouse them into action, even if one of their buddies got hurt.  Or to put it another way, when Superman can punch you through a wall with his fist, does he really get that upset if you cut him off in traffic?  Does he even drive in traffic?<br /><br />Bank is supposed to be a really mean guy, but Pacino barely gets to tear up the scenery because it's crowded with a dozen other actors.  So he's only sorta mean.  He's also really, really paranoid, which makes breaking into his place a challenge.  He invests in all kinds of technological defenses, including an artificial intelligence that uses face recognition to spot cheats.  Bank is truly a wonder of the modern age.<br /><br />Opposing this technological villain are our heroes, who kick it old school.  And by old school, I mean they buy a gigantic drilling machine to cause an earthquake, thereby temporarily shutting down the computer security system and giving the team time to get in and get out.<br /><br />This is pretty much where the movie broke down for me.  They bought a giant drill to get revenge on this guy?  Seriously?  When you have that much money, why not buy a big satellite laser and just nuke the guy from orbit?<br /><br />There are other nearly interesting plots, like the one in which Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon) decides he's up to the challenge of seducing Bank's right hand woman, Abigail Sponder (the SMOKING hot Ellen Barkin). And what do we get?  Caldwell ends up using some ridiculous technological doodad to knock her off her heels, which seems suspiciously similar to a date-rape drug.  If the movie was trying to make a statement about outwitting your opponent vs. using technology, it failed.  If it was trying to imitate the Rat Pack, I don't think drugging the hot chick (no matter how old she is) is how you do it.  And given that Barkin smolders on-screen, the fact that there's no actual pressing of flesh really makes the whole film into one big practical joke.  If Ocean's Thirteen were trying to emulate the old style heist movies, you'd better believe Caldwell would be keeping the "cougar" busy. The greater sin is that this leaves Barkin with nothing to do than look stupid.  She barely has any lines!<br /><br />There's other stuff that happens, some of it meant to be funny that's not so funny.  Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle, still using that ridiculous accent) gets to ham it up, which is a high point in the movie.  He writes touching letters to poor old Tishkoff to bring him out of his funk, but we're robbed of any sentimental feeling because we never find out what's in the letters.  And for reasons that don't make any sense to me, Brad Pitt and George Clooney are barely in the movie.  It's almost as if the guys thought that their egos got in the way of the second film, so instead they'd make it all not about them in the third film and that would make it better.<br /><br />It doesn't.  Ocean's Thirteen is a photocopy of a photocopy.  It feels like it's written by guys who didn't bother to see the original Ocean's Eleven and instead wanted to put in jokes about funny noses and "cougars."  The allure of the Rat Pack is that they were men playing a boy's game.  Ocean's Thirteen feels like boys playing a man's game.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The alpha and omega of the living dead"></head><body><p>The first time I saw &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; was at my own house, in the middle of the day, on a VHS tape I rented from a video store. The second time was on one of the worst excuses for a DVD I had ever seen: A Hollywood Classics edition of NOTLD that my buddy Jon had picked up for six bucks at Best Buy. It was worth every penny. The quality of it was so awful. The sound was off key, the picture looked like it was a digital transfer from an old tape someone had left in their garage to go through a few freezes, and the general look of it was terrible. So I say all hail the geniuses at Elite Entertainment who took it upon themselves to reissue this classic of horror films with a look and sound quality better than it originally had. The THX transfer of the film is impeccable. It looks simply amazing. But anyway, the reason I'm writing this review is because I've written three reviews for &quot;Dawn of the Dead,&quot; two for &quot;Day of the Dead,&quot; and yet I've never even touched on George Romero's original film that started it all.<p>Back in 1968, George Romero and his buddies were directing local commercials, using the money they made during the day to film &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; after hours. The story of a group of recluses trapped in an abandoned farm house out in the middle of Nowheresville, Pennsylvania with the living dead pounding on their doors, turning them against one another in a way that reflected the paranoia of the times. That's how I would've described the film to a potential investor. Oh yeah, did I mention that they were going to break all ground previously laid in the field of gore in cinema? The sight of former humans ripping flesh from char-fried limbs and a little girl laying waste to her mother with a gardening trowel are among the blood-caked spectacles in this film.<p>Shot in a grisly black and white that further accents the hopelessness in that house, &quot;Night&quot; is more about evoking the emotions of the humans as they fear the unknown and each other, more than the terror inflicted by the zombies outside. Throughout the entire trilogy of the Living Dead, George Romero has used his zombies to symbolize what human beings are becoming, as opposed to using them to instill fear in us. The real horror lies in that human beings, so involved with themselves, are becoming zombies, and that, if we can't work together toward a common goal like the people trapped in this ramshackle little farmhouse, then we deserve to be ripped to shreds and eaten alive by our fellow man. It's our fate if we can't be civilized.<p>If the zombies do really represent us, just on a lower evolutionary chain of civility, acting merely on instinct, then there's another point to be made, too. As great apes evolving into who we are now, humans worked together much easier than they seem to now. The instincts of these zombies is grotesque and stomach churning, but they are blameless; victim to their own way of half-life and hopeless to learn more in their search for food. Yet, they work together; they don't prey on each other. Not like the civilized humans trapped in the house who can't stop fighting with each other, thinking only of saving their own behinds. And as the last shot is fired, the last survivor drops to the floor. We don't deserve to survive. We let our paranoia and selfishness defeat us in the end.<p>Wow.</p></body></html>

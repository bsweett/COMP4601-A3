<meta name="summary" content="The Crater Steals the Show"></head><body><p>One of the most tedious movies released last year.  The first 45 minutes are devoted to watching a group of attractive young 20 somethings get drunk at a pool party.  It may be exciting to those who thrive on Reality TV, but no clear sense of any personality emerges from any of the characters at the party.  We just hear generic banal chatter, see them get plastered and dive into the pool.  Three of the partiers then go on a drive, stopping off at one of those creepy gas stations that only exist in horror movies, before making their way to this really cool crater.<br /><br />I loved this crater.  That crater was big, it was impressive.  If I ever go to Australia I want to visit that crater.  It was neat and litererally the only thing impressive about this movie.<br /><br />Sad to say, they leave the crater, return to the car which won't start, get a tow from a guy who sounds like Crocodile Dundee, and then do all kinds of wildly stupid things that leads to them getting killed.<br /><br />About the time they were getting towed I got bored and watched the rest of the movie in fast forward.<br /><br />When they started getting killed I tried reverting to regular play, only to find that the movie was still too slow, so I speeded it up again.  Even the stabbings are too slow in this picture.  Didn't the director watch Psycho?  Doesn't he know how to kill people and make it exciting?<br /><br />Apparently not.<br /><br />I cannot help but compare this to other movies about doomed tourists.  The best of which has to be An American Werewolf in London.  That movie opens up with an unsubtle visual metaphor of the heroes riding in the back of a truck filled with sheep -- lambs to the slaughter -- not to mention the fact that these are smart, funny guys whom the audience can immediately like.<br /><br />Then there's the more recent Hostel, a gruesome chiller that moves, even if the characters aren't quite as likable as American Werewolf in London.<br /><br />All in all, what can be said about a movie where the actors are upstaged by a hole in the ground?<br /><br />That is one dull movie.<br /><br />But a very cool crater.</p></body></html>

It's one of the more memorable films I have seen lately, and one that should be remembered as among the finest films of 2007, or rather, of any recent year. Young Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb (who's probably best known for her cameo performance in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory") lead a superb cast that also includes Robert Patrick - in a superb performance that's quite atypical from the roles he's best known for - and Zooey Deschanel in a riveting, delightful, yet also memorable, tale about using a child's superb gifts for imagination, the magical bonds of friendship and love that result between two young outcasts, and the bittersweet lesson which one of them must learn after an accidental tragedy. I was especially moved by Hutcherson's and Patrick's emotionally riveting performances, which almost left me in tears towards the end. I haven't read the original young adult novel of the same title, but I suspect that this fine film is a faithful adaptation, blessed with superb digital effects from WETA, which was also responsible for special effects work on "The Lord of The Rings" trilogy and "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe". This surprisingly well-crafted and well-acted film will touch the hearts of many, and is definitely one well worth viewing by an entire family.</p></body></html>

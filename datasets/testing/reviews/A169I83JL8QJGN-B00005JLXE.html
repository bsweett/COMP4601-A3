This movie had a lot going for it; it just didn't take it as far as it should have.<br /> I'm a huge Marvel Comics fan. I am fiercely loyal to the brand, and I seldom, if ever read comics published by other companies. As such, I have been very happy with the majority of movies based on Marvel titles. X-Men was fantastic, Spider-Man could have used a little more polish in the CGI arena, and Blade 2 was at least good for a laugh.<br /> Of the Marvel movies I always imagined that Daredevil would be one of the most difficult to do as a live action movie, simply because Matt Murdock is so deeply tortured, and the characters around him are so deep that it would take the perfect cast, the perfect director, and a good solid script to pull it off... the same with any other Marvel comic-turned movie. So far so, good, right?<br /> Daredevil did not have the perfect cast. While Affleck was perfect for Murdock (I know not everyone agrees, but I think he did great) and Farrell turned the cheesy villain Bullseye into something really cool, Jennifer Garner's Elektra left much to be desired... especially since she looks nothing like the comic character, not even remotely close, and as big of a fan as I am of Michael Duncan Clarke I was not impressed with him as the Kingpin, but that's the script and director's fault. I sincerely believe that this flaw in the film was the result of lacking screen time. Daredevil did to Kingpin what Star Wars did to Darth Maul.<br /> The plot was also a bit shallow in some regards. The movie did a great job in focusing on Matt Murdock, and his tortured soul, and presenting the world from his eyes... it did not do a good job of presenting the world around him from any other perspective. We do not get to know Elektra, we do not get to know Foggy, we do not get to know the Kingpin, or Bullseye. That's where this movie goes wrong.<br /> Spider-Man did a great job of allowing us to get to know both Peter Parker and Norman Osbourn, as well as Harry Osbourn, Mary Jane Watson, and even Aunt May. Spider-Man was a little on the long side, but that's a plus. I can sit through two and a half, or three, or even four hours of a good movie no problem. In contrast, Daredevil seemed too short for me, and the only hope I had by the end of the film was that they sequel wouldn't take long because I was not happy with the way the film ended, I was left hanging.<br /> I think that this movie should have left the audience, and Matt with a bit of a mystery to solve. Who was the Kingpin? Did he even exist? Elements of this mystery were there, but should have really been played upon. Perhaps we should have seen Wilson Fisk as a Philanthropist, someone that the uninitiated audience, as well as the community of the film would be shocked to find out turns out to be the Kingpin. Or at least the community of the film if we HAVE to have the interaction between Fisk, and Bullseye. Maybe Bullseye could receive emails instead just to ad to the mystery?<br /> What this movie did right was beautifully done, however. We got to know Matt Murdock very well, and for that I have to say kudos. I just wish that the movie had developed the other characters of Hell's Kitchen as well. The movie would have been a lot better that way. Instead it left me wanting.</p></body></html>

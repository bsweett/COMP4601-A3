Blu ray review."></head><body><p>Based on the HELLBLAZER comics, John Constantine (played like a robot by Keanu Reeves) is a demon hunter that can see demons and angels. His responsibility is to keep them in line if they go beyond what is allowed in tipping the balance between good and evil. The film revolves around detective Angela Dodson (the gorgeous Rachel Weisz) and her twin that commits suicide. She seeks the help of Constantine to determine what external forces may have played a role in her death. As they unravel the mystery they learn that her sister's death was only to draw Angela to play a part in a diabolical scheme. The concept and story are great. The supporting roles are filled by great actors like Shia LeBeouf, Tilda Swinton and check out who plays Lucifer! Keanu just kills it. He was great in the Matrix when asked to play like a robot because that's about all he is good at, lately. In Constantine, it just doesn't work. Viggo Mortensen or Guy Pearce would have made this a 4 star movie, but although the story and effects are good...Keanu brings it down a notch.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: Excellent picture and sound. All special features from DVD are here. FINAL VERDICT: UPGRADE WORTHY!</p></body></html>

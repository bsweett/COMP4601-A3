<meta name="summary" content="Broken Movie"></head><body><p>Before you think I'm one of "those people" who expect "Adam Sandler" style humor in order for a movie to be "funny" you should know I LOVED The Royal Tenenbaums. If you think I don't "understand" strange movies and must be force fed plots and subtext please understand I LOVED The Life Aquatic.<br /><br />Broken Flowers on the other hand is simply a shell of the above, coated in an armor of DULL. Each encounter Murray has seems worse than the one before it and by the time the movie rounds the three-quarter mark you will be saying; "Only a miraculous ending can save this mess of boredom." The funniest part is... the ending is quite possibly the worst part of it all. Not because I'm some mass-market-shlub that is not enlightened but because I'm not pompous enough to pretend to want to THINK about this movie any more than necessary after it was over. You can sit and try to pry symbolism out of this movie if you want but since the performances and dialogue were subpar, I suggest moving on with your life.<br /><br />Broken Flowers was indeed as bad as Lost in Translation. It wants to be a movie about awkward circumstances but instead BECOMES an awkward circumstance. The movie was simply poorly cast and lacks any sort of passion, the rest follows suit downhill. I am giving this two stars because the premise is at least good, and Bill was satisfying. I instead reccommend: Punch Drunk Love, The Royal Tenenbaums, the Life Aquatic, About Schimdt, or even Sunshine of the Eternal Mind; these movies are in the same vein, and they actually... bleed.</p></body></html>

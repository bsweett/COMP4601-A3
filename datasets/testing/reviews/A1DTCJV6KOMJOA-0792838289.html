<meta name="summary" content="This Film Deserves Everyone's Vote!"></head><body><p>A perfect film gives you four things; atmosphere, acting, dialogue and plot and The Manchurian Candidate uses these elements better than any thriller than I have ever seen period! The plot throws you into the pool of Sinatra (Bennett marco) nightmare head first. Harvey (Raymond Shaw) is the receipent of the Medal Of honor for rescuing his troop Marco included and saving their lives but Sinatra has these reocurring nightmare where visions of death andn torture are played out ny th ehands of his beloved Harvey, the man who saved his life, the man who is the ultimate good guy! As the film pushes forward we meet some most vile and disgusting people the leader of the bunch is Shaw's mother masterfully played by Angela Landsbury. She not only runs her son life she wants to run the country by controlling her not to bright senator husband poltical career. The utlimate key in to the entire film is a simple deck of cards i truly do not want to give away any of the plot but the ending will leave you jaw dropped! Now as for the atmosphere, acting, and dialogue. Even though color was the mainstay Frakenheimer used black and white to give the film a visual raunch and punch to it in the same vein as Hitchcock's Psycho. The acting is first rate but even though Sinatra's Marco is the central character it's Harvey in the role of the decontruced self loathing Sergeant Shaw who tears the film's dialogue and even adds to the films atmosphere! His cold eyes and chilling english bravado is pure power and the dialogue is witty and always pointed to the plot. For all it's worth The manchurian Candidate has to be seen to be appreciated it never treats the viewer as a viewer but as witness!</p></body></html>

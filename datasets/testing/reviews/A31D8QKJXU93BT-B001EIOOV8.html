<meta name="summary" content="She's Got Game!"></head><body><p>Anyone doubting Sharon Stone's acting skills needs to see Martin Scorcese direct her in "Casino," his epic about how the Mafia lost control of gaming in Las Vegas. Although she's had duds in her sporadic career, here she is a revelation, exhibiting a wide range of emotion and nuance unseen before or since. Stone is initially exciting and ultimately moving as the wife of casino czar Robert NeNiro. She certainly deserved the Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations she got.<br /><br />She's never been in headier company. In addition to DeNiro, she holds her own with the brilliant Joe Pesci, James Woods, Kevin Pollak and, in real casting coups, Las Vegas figures Don Rickles, Alan King, Dick Smothers in non-comedic roles and, as themselves, Frankie Avalon, Steve Allen and Jayne Meadows. Stone goes from glamourous hustler, to indulged wife and mother, to pathetic alcoholic and junkie, stealing scenes from the famous names around her. She had it in her or Scorcese drew it out, but who cares? It's stunning work no matter how she achieved it.<br /><br />Stone isn't the whole show. Scorcese moves the movie along with his trademark tracking shots, multiple narrators, intense violence and attention to detail, almost documentary detail on how casinos stack the cards against the suckers at the tables. Corruption thrives at every level as DeNiro tries to play the game, turn legit, marry and raise a family. But the same cards stacked against the suckers are also stacked against him, and his psycho childhood pal (Pecsi) becomes his adult adversary. Oddly, this true story ends badly for everybody but him.<br /><br />"Casino" followed Scorcese's shattering "GoodFellas," also with DeNiro and Pecsi in another true crime classic, maybe his best. But "Casino" has virtures of its own and grabs our lapels throughout. It is engrossing when showing how casinos operate, less so when showing how distrust wrecks a marriage; yet Stone suffuses these scenes with sympathy and pity. Would that other directors would challenge her in mature roles. If I were a gambler, my money would be riding on Sharon Stone.</p></body></html>

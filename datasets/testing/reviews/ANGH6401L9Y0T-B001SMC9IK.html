<meta name="summary" content="Better Than The Original, Amazingly Enough"></head><body><p>I never expected to like a remake so much better than the original, especially as here, where the original from 1951 was one of my special favorites. But this one takes the story to a whole new level, and not just because special effects have come so far in the last 50+ years. Apparently so have the scriptwriters, which gives me hope for the future.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves plays Klaatu in this one, and the entire sequence under which he contacts the humans is far more elaborate. A few things have not changed; a trigger-happy soldier wounds him, and he prevents GORT from harming anyone. (Interestingly, in this one it is the US Military that names Gort, using an acronym like they inevitably do.) And they do take him to a hospital from which he escapes, and there is a woman and a little boy who help him. And she does take Klaatu to visit a professor friend, who makes friends with Klaatu over a formula on a chalk board.<br /><br />But that about sums up the similarities. Amazingly, virtually all the differences are improvements. And if you think I'm going to spoil a wonderful movie like this by telling you what the differences are, you don't know me. However, one significant difference happens early on: The mother and son have been replaced by a step-mother and son, the boy of a mixed race and cute as can be; the mother quite white. Father died just about a year ago, and was in the military, which I believe is the same as the original. But of course it is a completely different war this time. So we have the additional human interest story of the tensions between the child and his step-mother, including a point where he shouts that he's not her son, he's just a kid that was dumped on her.<br /><br />I can't honestly assess whether it ended well or not, except that the earth was not destroyed. There was some damage, yes; but it was not destroyed. And that's really all I'm going to tell you. You really have to see it.</p></body></html>

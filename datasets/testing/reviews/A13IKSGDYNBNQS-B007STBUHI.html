<meta name="summary" content="The original summer blockbuster"></head><body><p>This film invented the Summer blockbuster, however unlike some that have followed this is a classic movie. Directed by Spielberg and with a fantastic cast, how could it go wrong? What we tend to forget now, is that Spielberg in 1975 hadn't had a blockbuster yet, so this was not a dead cert for success. However I think word of mouth and the quality of the film soon guarenteed its place in history.<br /><br />Roy Scheider is the Police Chief who's convinced there is something in the water, but is confronted by town officials only interested in not spoiling the tourist season. Scheider gives us a quietly determined man, whereas Robert Shaw's performance as Quint, a grizzled fisherman, is loud, aggresive and energetic. Richard Dreyfuss completes a great trio of leading actors. The mixed chemistry between them is perhaps the strongest point in the film.<br /><br />The film won 3 Oscars, most noteably of course for John Williams evocative music score (which also won a BAFTA as well). If you weren't born in the 70's, the DVD gives you the chance to see a great film in widescreen 2.35:1 with 5.1 Dolby Digital sound, which will be somewhat better than seeing the panned and scanned version frequently shown by many channels. A great film.</p></body></html>

He has a family that loves him, a wife that will follow him to the ends of the Earth, and a son that looks up to him.  On the night of his retirement, he is involved with a shooting dealing with the youngest son of Howard Saint.  Not thinking twice about the death, he retires and heads to the beach to celebrate his first extended family reunion in five years.  Unfortunately, Howard Saint is not one to let the death of his son go forgotten.  He sends a group of men down to the island to kill all of Castle's family.  They proceed to take everything from Frank, and even try to end his life as well, but luckily he is a fighter, and survives the assassination attempt.  This action brings upon the birth of a man hell-bent on revenging his family, a survivor known as, the Punisher.<br /><br />What follows next are massive amounts of explosions, witty and cheesy catch-phrases, and an exploration of what goes bump in those dark alleyways. Director Jonathan Hensleigh has done an exceptional job of bringing the darkness to the silver screen.  Castle is a tragic figure, his family has been killed, and he wants to bring "punishment" to those that viciously did this to his life.  He is not a happy character.  He does not have joy surrounding him and Hensleigh stays true to that.  There are several scenes in this film where we could have seen a bubbly Hollywood side to Castle.  Some directors would have gone another direction to perhaps give us a glimpse of his decency, but Hensleigh never went there.  He keeps Castle mysterious and void of emotion.  He has feelings, but that does not sway his thoughts on vengeance.  I was proud of this film for keeping true to the character.  There were some beautiful scenes that were used in this film that just made me as giddy as a schoolgirl.  One of my favorite scenes is when Castle uses a razor edge to chop one of his assailants.  The way he held the weapon and the camera angle truly brought out the style of the comic.<br /><br />The Punisher is not a superhero.  He is a normal person that will bleed when shot, and feel pain when hit ... he is human.  That is something that I wanted to make sure would be seen in this film, and it was.  I did not want the Punisher to be a superhero that could dodge bullets and cause damage with his single fist, and thankfully this was not the direction that Hensleigh took him.  There were several scenes where Castle was shot, where he couldn't move because he was in pain, and where he drank way too much.  This was a story of man who was willing to go to the full extreme to bring vengeance to his family.  He represented the decision that each one of us considers when hurt by another.  He is an average man that is fueled by love and hate.  In fact, that was what I felt about this film.  I loved it and hated it.  There were moments when I felt embarrassed for the cast, wondering if they knew what they were saying and doing, but most of these scenes were countered with amazing shots that built a beautifully gritty story to this powerful human.<br /><br />Overall, it was decent to watch.  Not one that I would watch again and again, but one that I wouldn't mind seeing the sequel if it is ever released.<br /><br />Grade:  *** out of ****</p></body></html>

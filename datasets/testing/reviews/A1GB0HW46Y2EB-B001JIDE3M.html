<meta name="summary" content="Two Dimensions of This are Enough"></head><body><p>Actually, I didn't watch this masterpiece in 3D.  Two dimensions of it were sufficient for me and I'm giving it one star for each dimension.  We have a story in which Brendan Fraser's scientist brother Max has disappeared and Trevor (Brendan Fraser)  is setting out to search for him.  But he gets saddled with having to care for Sean, Max's son played by Josh Hutcherson, who starts out as a bratty teenager and, of course, is initially p......d-off at the world.  (Actually, I was suspicious that Max simply couldn't stand Sean any longer and just took off).<br /><br />But, no. They follow Max's trail, aided by pretty guide, Hannah (Anita Briem) who causes Sean to drool a little, to the mouth of a volcano. They all begin to fall down a rabbit hole and finally land on a heap of sticks  and dry leaves -- no, I'm sorry, that's in Alice in Wonderland.  The volcano's hole turns into a water slide and they enter into a world that resembles a defective ride in a theme park.  They discover that Max had died there, of boredom no doubt, and encounter gigantic Venus flytraps (I  never saw any gigantic flies, though), dinosaurs stomping around and birds that glow in the dark.  They also get to ride in a mining car which turns into a roller-coaster that manages to jump across a ten foot gap and land on the tracks on the other side, the chances against that happening being about 30 billion to one.  At another point on their raft, a sharp-toothed fish is getting closer and closer to taking a bite out of Hannah's rump as Sean is watching and his lips seem to be saying "Go for it, go for it!"<br /><br />Even though I was watching this movie in 2D, it was obvious that it was shot in 3D because actors are seen pointing out at the camera or shooting a yo-yo out of the frame at you or some other shenanigans, which simply stalls any continuity this film might have had.  By the time it's over Sean has transformed into a smiling puppy, licking his uncle's hand or whatever.<br /><br />The 1959 version of this story is a much superior film, having actors such as James Mason, Arlene Dahl and Pat Boone (Pat Boone??  Yes, it is Pat Boone), it's rather antique special effects notwithstanding.  Some shots were actually made in Carlsbad Caverns, I believe.  Now, you can't get more realistic than that.  The backgrounds in this new film look very much like painted scenery flats and the dinosaur chase scene with the characters running in the foreground on a treadmill is clearly a green screen process not particularly well executed.<br /><br />I had completely forgotten that Brendan Fraser had done a really nice acting job in the fine film "Gods and Monsters."  What did he do to deserve this mess?  Presumably he was well paid for it.</p></body></html>

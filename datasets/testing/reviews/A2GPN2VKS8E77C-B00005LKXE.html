I have not read the novels, so I can't compare them. The reviews I read (mostly from newspapers and Christian websites) said that this was a really gory movie, so I was expecting that. I was a trifle disappointed that there really wasn't very much blood (and that a pivotal flashback sequence was barely visible, though the audience gets the idea from the blurred images in the scene). That's my only complaint. Oh, yes...why were there scenes in the trailer that were deleted from the film? Really stupid practice, that is. Excellent movie. The film SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN RATED "R." The acting is top-notch on every level. If you love "Silence," you'll enjoy "Hannibal."<br /><br />Ta-ta.<br /><br />H.</p></body></html>

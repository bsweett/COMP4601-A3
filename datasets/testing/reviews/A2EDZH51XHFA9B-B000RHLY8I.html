Upon reflection, that's not terribly surprising, given how strong a film it is; good things, it often seems, never flourish in the sandy, sandy soil of Hollywood. And Niccol (Gattaca) has created a good thing here.<br /><br />Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) and his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) are arms dealers operating in the grey areas of the law. Or they are until Vitaly develops a rather nasty drug habit and goes into rehab, leaving Yuri to fly solo-- just as the Berlin Wall comes down and the arms market takes off. Yuri is being dogged by Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke), an FBI agent who's sure he's breaking the law.<br /><br />As an action movie, it's kind of fun, interesting, a bit slow at times but watchable all the same. As a chronicle of the slow descent into corruption of a guy who's just trying to make his way in the world, it's incisive, well-done, witty, charming. However, the movie really shines as a survey of the political and economic structure of the world in the nineties. Yuri Orlov is the perfect character to allow Niccol to ruminate on the general anarchic wackiness of a lot of different hot spots at the time. Yuri traipses through the former Soviet Union and Africa, and Niccol follows with his camera, casting light on some very nasty characters who are thinly-veiled (at best) analogues of real dictators. It's good stuff; you probably didn't see it in the theater (very few did), but you can catch what you missed then on DVD now. ****</p></body></html>

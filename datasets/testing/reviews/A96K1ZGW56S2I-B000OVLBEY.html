Sure the guy looked cool, but it didn't make any sense to me that a person could sell their soul to save a person they loved and then receive demonic powers that they would use to thwart the demon who had given the powers to them.  The idea still doesn't make any sense to me, but after having seen GHOST RIDER I have a better understanding about the character and his motivations.<br /><br />In the mythos that the film sets up, every generation has a Ghost Rider, a person who is given incredibly powers from the devil (well, not really, he's not Satan but is instead Mephistopheles) to use to do his dirty work in exchange for some great gift.  The film begins with the voice of The Caretaker (Sam Elliot) telling a story about a Ghost Rider from long ago who when it came time to pay the devil out ran the demon and made it to safety.  This opening segment seems quaint, but it actually ties into the story later on.  The story then fast forwards several years where we meet a younger Johnny Blaze (Matt Long) and his father Barton (Brett Cullen).  The Blazes are motorcycle stuntmen who mainly perform at a stationary carnival.  They are a good team and Barton loves his son.  However, Barton is dying of cancer and hides this from Johnny.  Johnny discovers the secret and finds himself torn.  He knows how much his father is sacrificing for him.  That's when a mysterious man arrives and offers to heal Johnny's father, but the price is his soul.  Before Johnny even realizes what has happened his blood has signed the deed and he finds himself the servant of a demon, Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda).  Needless to say, the event changes Johnny's life.  He leaves behind the girl he was going to marry, Roxanne (Raquel Alessi) and sets out to make a new life.  Years later Mephistopheles' own son threatens to overthrow the demon and take his place as second-in-command of Hell.  So, Mephistopheles summons Johnny (now played by Nicholas Cage) away from his reunion with Roxanne (now played by Eva Mendes), transforms him into the Ghost Rider, and commands him to send his errant son and his friends back to Hell.<br /><br />The special effects in GHOST RIDER are pretty amazing.  The director, Martin Steven Johnson, and other filmmakers did an excellent job of creating the character of Ghost Rider.  The burning skull on wheels that's the devil's bounty hunter appears realistic.  I enjoy watching Sam Elliot in films and having him portray The Caretaker was an excellent idea.  Eva Mendes doesn't get to do much on screen other than look pretty, but she is one of the most attractive women in Hollywood (she has real curves) and makes any film more bearable to watch.  As for Nicholas Cage, he's not as good as Johnny Depp (the man originally slated for the title role), but Cage is a good actor and a huge fan of the comic book.  Despite having a hair piece that took three hours a day to set in play, he does justice to the character.  The film also does a good job at introducing people to the character of the audience.<br /><br />However, great actors and amazing special effects are not enough to make a movie like GHOST RIDER good.  The most important thing in any movie is to have a good story.  The general plot of GHOST RIDER is not a very good story.  It has a good introduction and opening sequence, but quickly moves downhill from there.  For instance, it's never made clear exactly why the contract Mephistopheles wants is so important.  The contract is supposed to contain untold evil that will bring a new Hell to Earth, but it's never made clear why--even when the characters explain what is happening, it makes no sense.<br /><br />Part of that might be because the story doesn't do a very good job of sticking to the rules of the universe it sets up.  For instance, The Caretaker tells Johnny that he should stay with him because demons can't stand on holy ground.  A few scenes we find Blackheart (Mephistopheles' son) and his demon buddies in a church harassing and torturing a priest.  In comic books inconsistencies like this happen quite often because there are different writers with different agendas each creating the same character.  This has gotten better in recent years as the comic book industry has attempted to create a better consistency to attract new readers without offending older ones, but it still happens.  In the comic book industry, such a thing is acceptable, but when it happens in a movie it's an example of shoddy writing and filmmaking.  Films based off a comic book can't be exactly like the works they are based on because they are two completely different mediums.<br /><br />In addition to the lack of an exciting story and poor writing, the character development is pretty bad.  The best comic book movies, such as the SPIDER MAN films or BATMAN BEGINS or even the original SUPERMAN don't just rely upon a good story, fine actors, and special effects.  They also do a thorough job of developing the central characters.  GHOST RIDER doesn't do that.  We get to know Johnny Blaze fairly well and The Caretaker, but that's about all.  Take Roxanne for instance.  We have no idea why she loves Johnny are why over a decade after he left her behind she still cares for him.  Eva Mendes is not only a beautiful actress, but she's also talented, but she isn't allowed to display her talents in GHOST RIDER.  Instead she just gets to play a cardboard damsel in distress.<br /><br />Overall, GHOST RIDER is just an average movie.  It has a lot of special effects, some great actors, and a great central character, but in the end it doesn't even ride high enough to travel into the sunset.  Fans of the Ghost Rider comic book might enjoy the film.  I'd also recommend seeing it if you are a fan of Sam Elliot, Nicholas Cage, or Eva Mendes, as well as someone looking to consume a piece of mindless eye candy with some action.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Thank goodness for a true story movie like this!"></head><body><p>This movie has got to be one of the best 117 minutes to spend with. Will Smith delivers in this movie on the true story of Chris Gardner, a man in 1981 with a prospect of an uncertain future in San Francisco after his wife leaves him to raise their only child. It's a movie that features a roller coaster of emotions for those who watch it. It's refreshing to know that there is a positive ending to this true life story of a man who was an unpaid intern for a brokerage firm and later became a success story on Wall Street! Highly recommended film for everyone!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Troy"></head><body><p>Throughout time, men have waged war. Some for power, some for glory, some for honor--and some for love. In ancient Greece, the passion of two of history's most legendary lovers--Paris, Prince of Troy and Helen, Queen of Sparta--ignites a war that will devastate a civilization. When Paris steals Helen away from her husband, King Menelaus, it is an insult that cannot be suffered. Troy is a stunningly movie, with an equally stunning cast. This movie takes your attention completely. Tremendously entertaining.</p></body></html>

Then I took out his other one."<br /><br />"Now, that's a mighty fine leathercoat your wearin'."<br /><br />- Hartigan takes down The Bastard, for the second time, while Marv goes coat shopping in "Sin City"<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez hits the nail on the head with this religously, faithful adaption to Frank Miller's cult comic book of the same name. Miller was very cautious as to whether or not he wanted to bring his comic to the big screen (he had been burned by Hollywood before with "Robocop 2"). But, it was full steam ahead when Rodriguez brought a CGI animatic of what the film might look like to Miller (the same CGI presentation was used to also lure Bruce Willis to jumping on board)<br /><br />"Sin City" is much in the same way & inspiration as that of "Pulp Fiction" (Quentin Tarantino directs one small scene in the film. A minor debt he owed to Rodriguez, since Rodriguez supplied Tarantino the score to both editions of "Kill Bill" for one dollar). If you like "Fiction" you'll love "Sin".<br /><br />"Sin City" consists of four stories that are taken a little out of context.<br /><br />The first two stories bookend the film. The first story has to do with a sociopath (Josh Hartnett), with "Sin City" segueing into its 2nd story about a cop (Bruce Willis) on his last day on the job, before retiring, trying to catch a child molester he's been after, called The Bastard. The cop gets in over his head when he finds out that The Bastard has family in high places.<br /><br />The 3rd story has a former boxer turned nutcase, by the name of Marv (Mickey Rourke), who is looking for the killer who killed off his favorite & only prostitute, Angel, & getting framed for the whole thing.<br /><br />The final story has a brutal cop and his buddies getting killed by a group of prostitutes, in Prostitute Row, a section of Sin City that is ruled by its prostitutes. The only rule is, is that cops can not be killed for any reason at all. Oops. The leader of Prostitute Row (a scantily clad, Rosario Dawson) & her boyfriend (Clive Owen) try to cover up the whole mess before the authorities arrive. They don't stand a chance.<br /><br />Sin City is shot entirely in green screen & on a soundstage no bigger than a warehouse. The handcuff fight sequence between Marv & the young psycho kid were shot seperately. Mickey Rourke & Elijah Wood never met each other until the films L.A. premiere!<br /><br />The look of the film is jawdropping. It looks exactly like the comic book, panel by panel (for those not in the know, the comic book is in black & white with some elements in color. I.e., a character says he drives a red Cadilac, you will see him drive a red Cadilac, but everything else on the page is B&W). At times I felt as if I was watching the comic book come to life. And it does.<br /><br />"Sin City" came out in theatres in early April '05 and will most likely be hitting DVD in late July or August, with everything including Marv's bandages thrown in. You'll need' em.<br /><br />With "Sin City" already recouping most of its budget expect to see more return trips to the City in the future. I already got my bus ticket.</p></body></html>

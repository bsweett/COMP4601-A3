<meta name="summary" content="What is the Matrix?  Really."></head><body><p>The two sequels to THE MATRIX have the same problem.  Sure, they are pretty much equally entertaining, but only the sum of some parts.  The WACHOWSKI's spent too much time in smokey rooms worrying about the phiosophical aspects of their project, and didn't realize the best parts of the original MATRIX were the FX heavy action sequences.  Hey, I'm as critical of plotting and story importance as anyone, but the draw of these B sci-fi flicks is the mayhem.  The battle for ZION is the best thing here, the special effects are simply amazing.  The story is weak.  What actually transpires at the end and why is very up-in-the-air, and seems rather rushed.  Although visually superior to almost anything out there, THE MATRIX series goes out with a dud, fully due to weak story.  Here's MY philosophy; why not make a film with an excellent sci-fi adventure story AND wicked FX?  As with RELOADED and REVOLUTIONS one can be decently satisfied with the one aspect, which is decent enough to like it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Stop making the popcorn movies, Will Smith!!"></head><body><p>Will Smith stated in a recent 60 Minutes interview that when he and his agent were mapping out his career strategy, they noted that most of the top ten films of all time were those with lots of special effects. Films like Independence Day, Men in Black and Wild, Wild West followed. After seeing I Am Legend, I have to say that it's time for Mr. Smith to drop the popcorn movies and put his talent to much better use.<br /><br />I've seen both of the previous film versions of Richard Matheson's novel I Am Legend. I saw the Vincent Price version -- Last Man on Earth -- when I was young and don't remember it that well. But I have seen The Omega Man several times and, in fact, own a copy of it on DVD. The Omega Man is dated, to be sure -- 70's hipster language and Charlton Heston do not mix. However, the opening sequences of the film, showing a deserted Los Angeles, are eerily effective. In one shot, we can see nothing moving for miles -- no people, no cars, no traffic helicopters ... nothing at all. Anyone who has been in Los Angeles can tell you what an accomplishment an effect like that really is. With good supporting performances by Rosiland Cash and, especially, Anthony Zerbe as the ringleader of the vampires/mutants, The Omega Man is flawed, but in the end, very, very effective.<br /><br />I Am Legend, similarly, has some fairly effective opening shots of a deserted New York City. However, on closer inspection, the viewer can see that a lot of the effect is due to CGI. The weeds growing out of the streets don't look quite right and the delapidated look on the buildings is very unconvincing. This flaw is hammered home when Smith chases a herd of deer in his Mustang. When a lion attacks one of the deer, the effect is so artificial looking, I was wondering if Yogi Bear was going to appear next.<br /><br />Nowhere, however, do the CGI effects fail more completely than with the vampire mutants. In contrast with The Omega Man where the mutants are played by live actors, all of the creatures in I Am Legend are CGI. The effect is ridiculously cartoonish and wholly unconvincing. And what kind of killer virus actually makes its victims more agile? These creatures were once human beings and now they're able to climb up walls of Manhattan brownstones like mountain goats? Instead of being frightened by the creatures, I found myself rolling my eyes and wondering when Hollywood was going to realize just how bad some CGI effects really look.<br /><br />However, the film's shortcoming aren't just technical. The Omega Man had an extended flashback sequence showing how the virus overtook civilization. Many people drop dead right before our eyes and the horror of the situation is hammered home very effectively. I Am Legend, in contrast, gives up dribs and drabs of flashbacks -- mostly as Smith's dream sequences. The most impressive shot in the film shows fighter jets blowing up the bridges leading into Manhattan -- one of the times where the special effects are really up to the task. However, we never get the same sense of horror watching civilization collapse that we do in The Omega Man. We see a couple of infected people fail a screening and that's about the extent of it. We don't see anyone mutate into one of the creatures. We don't see dozens drop dead from the virus. The fall of civilization doesn't deliver the dramatic punch to the stomach it should.<br /><br />Smith is alone for most of the film. Towards the end, a mother and her son rescue him and briefly move in with him. In The Omega Man, we learn about Rosiland Cash's character and her infected nephew. In I Am Legend, however, the two characters are merely a plot device. They're basically there to move the plot to its conclusion and nothing more. The parts are so badly written, I wondered why they were necessary at all. Instead of caring about these new characters, I spent the final part of the film thinking about what a weak job the screenwriter did on that portion of the script.<br /><br />The only really good thing about I Am Legend is Will Smith's performance. He is excellent at portraying a man who is slowly going mad from lonliness. His heart is in the project even with the numerous flaws and his acting is the only really convincing thing about the entire film. Throughout the film I kept thinking that Smith's performance deserved a better film to showcase it. I felt bad for him, but that sympathy has to be tempered by the knowledge that it was his career goal to seek out projects like this.<br /><br />I'll grant Smith that some of his "prestige projects" like Ali and The Legend of Bagger Vance didn't do that well at the box office. Hollywood, for all the talk about creative expression, is driven by ticket sales and money. However, The Pursuit of Happyness did do well at the box office and showed that Will Smith, given a good script and a good director to work with, can combine artistic excellence with financial success without having to resort to loads of stunts and special effects. Leonardo DiCaprio chooses to work with name directors on films with good scripts in lieu of the summer blockbuster films and he still has as much influence and industry muscle as anyone in Hollywood. There is no reason why Will Smith can't do the same thing. He is supremely talented and intelligent (I'm positive he could be a terrific writer, director and producer as well as actor), should minimize his participation in films like I Am Legend and should choose projects that take more risks and aspire to more than just box office receipts. I Am Legend and other films like it are just a waste of his talent.</p></body></html>

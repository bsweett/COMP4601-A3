<meta name="summary" content="Really beautiful, not very interesting"></head><body><p>Road to Perdition has the spirit of a film noir : put a character in a bind, and then watch as he tries to get out and sinks himself further and further. There is some attraction to that kind of material. Here it is brainless, contrived, violent and ultimately uninteresting (apart from Hanks' plan to rob banks in a rather unorthodox way). Its esthetics, however, is quite colorful : it may not be a very interesting movie, but it's really beautiful. <p>Tom Hanks, as an Irish mafia hitman, is dependable as usual. The movie is wonderfully acted, and the visuals, as Ebert says, are &quot;a limbo of darkness, shadow, night, fearful faces half-seen, cold and snow&quot;. One could not hope more from Sam Mendes' direction (who also did American Beauty). The problem is that there is no story behind it. As we watch it, the painful truth that no one will survive this ordeal is obvious, and we only wait in apprehension for the loud bullet shots to end it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This great film retains its visual and dramatic power"></head><body><p>This is a great film and one of my very favorite movies.  I love everything about it.  The exquisite length and pacing of this film can only work when the dialogue, acting, and pictures support it.  Here the movie is packed with everything wonderful from the first sound of the tympani to the credits.<p>My father always felt that Peter O'Toole was cheated when the best actor Oscar went to Gregory Peck for "To Kill a Mocking Bird" and I have always agreed with that view.  Nothing against Mr. Peck, but O'Toole gave a spectacular performance that has not lost its power over time.<p>While I am not a film scholar, I have always found David Lean a compelling story teller with his images as well as the dialogue.  Here, the images are so beautiful, powerful, and vast that they never leave the memory.  They become part of our visual language.  Who doesn't get thirsty when the Nefud is being crossed?  Whose heart is touched when Lawrence comes out of the Sinai into the officers club with the boy?  Who doesn't feel a mix of blood lust and revulsion in the battle scenes - especially at the train and the slaughter of the Turks on the way to Damascus?<p>The extras on the making of the movie and the reprint of the original theatrical program (though in a much smaller size) are quite good and valuable.  It is hard for me to get my kids to understand that we used to get dressed up to go to movies and they did sell program which people bought, read, and KEPT.  Different times ...<p>Yes, the events in which Lawrence played a part were a sideshow of a sideshow of the Great War, but they certainly get their monument in this great film.</p></body></html>

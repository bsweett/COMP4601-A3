<meta name="summary" content="Independence Day (Single Disc Widescreen Edition) (1996)-Good  Sci-fi flick."></head><body><p>Independence Day (Single Disc Widescreen Edition) (1996) was a very entertaining 4 star film.  Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum are always good as were most of the well selected crew. This film featured a good story, great cast, and fine special effects. The creature design for the aliens was imaginative and very credible.<br /><br />I understand that the Air Force could not give this film its full support because of the UFO reference made to Area 51. They desired to, however, and were very happy with the patriotic plot and the positive light it placed the US Air Force in.</p></body></html>

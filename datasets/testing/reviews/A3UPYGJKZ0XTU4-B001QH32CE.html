<meta name="summary" content="You Will Be Charmed by this Frank and Frustrated Pie Waitress."></head><body><p>"Waitress" is a rare film that makes quirky characters seem entirely genuine and coaxes the audience to find humor in nearly everything. Keri Russell delivers the performance of her career as a frank and frankly unhappy small-town Southern woman. Jenna (Keri Russell) is a waitress and star pie chef at Joe's Pie Diner, where best friends Becky (Cheryl Hines) and Dawn (Adrienne Shelly) also wait tables. Jenna dreams often of new pies and of escaping her self-obsessed, controlling husband Earl (Jeremy Sisto). She's annoyed to find herself pregnant and resents the idea of her impending motherhood. But Jenna finds unexpected romance and companionship with her new doctor Jim Pomatter (Nathan Fillion).<br /><br />"Waitress" finds a remarkable and surprising tone. Writer/director Adrienne Shelly takes a humorous perspective on life's shortcomings and on her characters' relationships, good and bad. Jenna doesn't like being pregnant and hates her abusive husband. This could be the stuff of melodrama, or worse, preachy. But "Waitress" had me laughing out loud while never losing sympathy for Jenna's predicament. The quirky cast of characters doesn't seem self-conscious, because they demonstrate genuine affection for each other, including a nice turn by veteran Andy Griffith as the diner's curmudgeonly owner. It's sad that Adrienne Shelly didn't live to see the film's success, because "Waitress" demonstrates great originality and wit with potentially touchy and tired material.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2007): "This is How We Made Waitress Pie" (10 min) interviews director, cast, and producer Michael Rioff about the film's characters and relationships. In "Written and Directed by Adrienne Shelly: A Memorial" (7 min), cast and producer Rioff talk about working with the director. "Hi! I'm Keri, I'll Be Your Waitress" (6 min) interviews Keri Russell about Jenna, the film, and its reception. "The Pies Have It!" (3 min) discusses the role of pies in the movie and everyone tells us his/her favorite pie. "The Movie Channel Presents: In Character with Keri Russell, Cheryl Hines, Nathan Fillion" (10 min) is three parts. "A Message from Keri Russell about the Adrienne Shelly Foundation" (1 min). There is an audio commentary with Keri Russell and producer Michael Rioff that talks a lot about filming scene-by-scene. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish,  French. Dubbing available in Spanish.</p></body></html>

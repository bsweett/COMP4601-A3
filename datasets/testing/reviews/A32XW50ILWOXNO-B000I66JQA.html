<meta name="summary" content="An emotional cauldron of great performances and filmmaking"></head><body><p>More intense and focused than the book that inspires it, "The Hours" has the presence of a gathering, angry storm, manifested in three women whose convictions, desires and wills do not entirely match, yet all find themselves wondering if their lives could have or should have more to them than they do. <p> Nicole Kidman is the standout as Virginia Woolf, the early 20th Century British novelist both ahead of and trapped by her era, embarking upon writing her book,  "Mrs. Dalloway," which she believes will fully distinguish her genius. Julianne Moore is Laura Brown, a 1950s  Florida housewife reading the book and attempting to prepare a proper birthday cake for her husband. Meryl Streep is Clarissa Vaughn, who intends to throw a party for a friend dying of AIDS (Ed Harris) as he's about to receive the Carrothers Prize for poetry. <p> Director Stephen Daldry plays up the parallels of the three women, much as Michael Cunningham did in the book. In the compressed universe of a movie, these parallels are more obvious, and at times intrusive on the story, as Daldry seems to need to point and nod at his stylistic flourishes (See the flowers? Notice the dialogue?) to a point reaching irritation.<p> But the performances carry the movie past the indulgences.  Kidman, as Woolf, stalks her brooding scenes as if she's in her final role -- Daldry likes how Kidman smokes a cigarette so much, he shows it several times. Kidman, with a prosthetic nose plastered on to complete the character's transformation, holds her cards close -- Woolf is brilliant, and slightly mad, and good at concealing her moods -- until a late, angry scene at a train station, as she attempts to flee her rural England home for London, a main source of her madness. Kidman controls this performance; it doesn't get away from her like Alice Harford did in "Eyes Wide Shut." She's outstanding.<p> Moore and Streep, obviously, inhabit smaller roles. Between the two, Moore has to work harder to make us believe her housewife is teetering so much on the edge of things that she's prone to crack. I'm not sure she gets there; she doesn't have enough time to develop Laura Brown's quirks, and what time she does have she underplays. <p> Streep has her own troubles, playing Clarissa, a fiftyish lesbian -- methinks Streep doesn't exude "lesbian," hence, this aspect of Clarissa is downplayed -- who very well could have lived an entire life with her friend Richard (Harris), a brooding, mercurial genius not unlike Woolf, who once kissed Clarissa on a sand dune near the ocean and defined her one moment of pure happiness.  What I love about Streep is her willingness to let others chew the scenery -- she's a cheery team player for a superstar, ain't she? -- and boy, does Ed Harris gnaw away. <p>What the hell's gotten into this man? Five years ago, he was slogging around in "Milk Money" and hamming it up in "Stepmom." Now, with this performance and his tour de force work in "Pollock," he's redefining anger mismanagement. Harris has two extended scenes, and it's all he needs to put a sad, cruel stamp on the whole movie, like Woolf, his mind is a caged animal, bound up in ways by AIDS in he can never shake loose. You might remember him more than any of the women.<p> Inevitably, you compare the movie to the book. Daldry's version --- my guess is this kind of movie can and will be remade a different way -- holds up. Cunningham, in the novel, allows himself the ability to rustle through the minds of his characters -- all of them -- whenever he sees fit; one of the great triumphs of the book is that he keeps the reader on a clear and straight path through all the shifting perspectives. Although it contains suicides, the novel's pervading emotion is of fleeting sadness, or, in some cases regret. Daldry cranks up those emotions into a stiffer drink; an early scene with Clarissa in the flower shop, which passes without much incidence in the book, is an opportunity for Daldry in the movie to convey heavy tension. To his credit, Daldry isn't fearful to become less-than-elegant and press his camera into these women's faces. And what few special effects there are work nicely. In the end, Daldry respected the pedigree of his actresses and the novelist but worked them over a little, too, and the end result is unsettling and dramatic.<p>It was a mature, intelligent picture. It brought me to read the book, which I think might supplement the movie better than the movie would supplement the book. The book fills in the remaining blanks, but the meat of the book's power is right there on the screen.<p>"The Hours" won't let you down.</p></body></html>

Homer's 'Iliad' Brought To Life!!"></head><body><p>Wolfgang Petersen's (Air Force One) adaptation of the classic poem by Homer is an excellent piece of work. True, a lot of liberties are taken, but WHAT ELSE CAM YOU EXPECT? David Bienhoff's AWESOME screenplay makes the story more dramatic than the poem was, the poem was just violence; but the script called for TONS of emotion from every actor and it worked like a charm. Diane Kruger (Helen) was perfectly cast as "The face that launched a thousand ships." Brad Pitt was terrific as Achilles, the greatest of the Greek warriors. Orlando Bloom ("The Lord Of The Rings" trilogy and "Pirates Of The Caribbean") was in top form as Paris, as were Eric Bana as Hector and the legendary Peter O'Toole as Priam. Julie Christie ("Dr. Zhivago" and Kenneth Branagh's 1996 adaptation of "Hamlet") did well in her one scene as Thetis, Achilles' mother. Sean Bean (the villainous Agent 006 in "Goldeneye", etc.) was good as Odysseus, hero of "The Odyssey". Brendan Gleeson ("M:I-2", "AI: Artificial Intelligence", etc.) and Brian Cox (the evil right wing militarist in "X-2: X-Men United", Disney's "The Rookie") were appropriately regal in their roles as Agammemnon and Menelaus. The actor who stood out, though, was Brad Pitt. His portrayal of Achilles gives the warrior a sense of humanity in his treatment of Briseus, Hector's lovely cousin. Compared to Mel Gibson's mega-hit "The Passion Of The Christ", this movie is almost bloodless, though there ARE gorier films than that one. Rated PG-13 for violence and some sensuality/brief nudity.</p></body></html>

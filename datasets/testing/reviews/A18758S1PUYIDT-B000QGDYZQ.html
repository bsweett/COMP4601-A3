This film does not feel very original or unique, and it seems as if everyone in it is trying too hard to make it plausible.  Something really funny: SPOILER!!<br /><br /> When Sandra sees her hubby's car blow up after being hit by a big rig, she is still yelling at him to get out of the car!  How in the heck is he supposed to do that?  Too funny.  But also too silly.</p></body></html>

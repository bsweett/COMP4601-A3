<meta name="summary" content="The Human Side of The Other"></head><body><p>Like lots of America kids, I was raised on heroic tales of America's history in World War II. Its images, among them the iconic flag-raising at Iwo Jima, were forever seared into my imagination. Not to mention that I happened to grow up in the town that lays claim to Rene Gagnon, one of the flag-raisers!<br /><br />I don't think it ever occurred to me that there was another side to the story, that of the faceless enemy that hid in caves and bunkers, lying in wait to slaughter our brave boys.<br /><br />"Letters from Iwo Jima" is director Client Eastwood's attempt to humanize the Japanese and show the fight from their side. The story focuses on General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) sho is unusual or a Japanese military man - he carefully plans the battle, with a clear-eyed assessment of the strengths and tactics of his enemy. That puts him at odds with many of his colleagues, who have no respect for the Americans as warriors and presume an easy victory over them. The rank and file are represented by Private First Class Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya), a family man and simple baker placed in the crosshairs of history. Saigo's open and expressive face makes him the perfect antithesis to the dehumanized and faceless "Jap" that many of us grew up on. The film takes us from the preparations for the battle, the landing itself, the relentless pounding that the Japanese took rom air and sea and the desperate life living in tunnels clawed from the volcanic rock.<br /><br />If anything, the film swings perhaps a bit too far toward defanging the Japanese. They are portrayed as poor grunts riven to work by a few obsessively crazed superiors. They empathize with wounded Americans. General Kuribayashi is often shown writing sad letters home to his family. Except for a few madly patriotic soldiers, most of the island's defenders just seem ready to go home. I hate to spoil the party, but Iwo's garrison had dug 11 miles of tunnels into rock. Perhaps not all were political fanatics, but it seems to me that it would take more than a half-hearted attempt to accomplish that feat!<br /><br />Nonetheless, "Letters from Iwo Jim" is a success, and gives a small taste of what the battle might have looked like from the other end of US Marine and Navy guns. A worthy companions to "Flags of Our Fathers," Eastwood's companion piece from the American point of view.</p></body></html>

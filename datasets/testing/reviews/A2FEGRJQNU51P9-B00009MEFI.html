<meta name="summary" content="very good movie, Sutherland is perfect!"></head><body><p>I first heard of Phone Booth a year or two ago when Jim Carrey had dropped out of the project.  I loved the premise: a man answers a ringing phone and steps inside the phone booth.  He is told by the man on the phone that he is in the sights of a high powered rifle.  The movie will be an hour and a half and will take place almost exclusively in the phone booth.  It sounds very experimental and could be a horrible failure or be very interesting.  The movie was delayed for a reason I don't remember, and then it was delayed this past fall because of the sniper attacks in Washington D.C.  Finally, the movie gets released this April and I finally get a chance to see this movie that I've been hearing about for a long time now.  <p>I've already mentioned the basic plot of the movie, so I'll go into a little bit more detail on the story.  Colin Farrell plays a slick publicist who calls his girlfriend (but takes off his wedding ring while making the call) from a phone booth so that his wife does not find out about it.  When he finishes with the call, the phone rings.  He answers it and now finds himself in a situation where if he leaves the booth, a sniper threatens to kill him.  The voice of the sniper is played by Keifer Sutherland, and this casting is perfect.  I cannot imagine anyone bringing more menace to a phone conversation than Sutherland.  While Farrell does a very good job in his role, it is Sutherland that makes the movie.  Unfortunately, it is Sutherland's character that is without strong motivation.  We must accept that he is a nut, because his reasoning is not very credible (maybe that is the point, but even so).  Despite this flaw, I absolutely loved the movie.  <p>There was quite a bit of tension and suspense all the way through the film, with enough brief scenes of humor (sometimes the humor came from the tension) to not make it unbearable.  Simply put, this was a well played, well acted, and well made film.  Not perfect, but it is a very good movie.</p></body></html>

The film is two and half hours long and the pace is not pretty rapid, things start out slow but the tension build and the exotic, thrilling atmosphere is created successfully, such that the characters make your eyes get glued to the screen completely and you find yourself holding your breath to observe their consequences. The film may not be perfect and leave you wanting for more, but the strong performances really make up for tiny flaws. A really good film for a Friday Night, if you are ready for neat and a genuine thrilling experience. Worth watching!</p></body></html>

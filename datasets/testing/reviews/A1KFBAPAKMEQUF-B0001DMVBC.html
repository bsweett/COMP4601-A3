<meta name="summary" content="A Genuine Masterpiece"></head><body><p>I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and completely identified with the Iranian immigrant family who were pursuing their American dream, while longing for what they had been forced to flee from in their native land.  As an immigrant myself, I understand the desire to own your own home and do well, even while holding on fiercely to one's cultural background.<p>I did not identify at all with the careless female who failed to aggressively ensure that her home was securely in her possession, and who turned around and tried to blame all her problems on the immigrant family who had worked hard to save money to buy her auctioned home.  Apparently, Ms. Connelly's character did not work, was an alcoholic, had no friends, and was generally a layabout.  It just struck me that she was lucky enough to inherit the home from a hardworking father, but failed to take any actions to ensure that she would continue to own this home.  I could not understand why she blamed the immigrant family who legally came into possession of her home, and engaged in what I deem to be harassment against them, instead of suing the county for what she believed was an illegal tax.<p>Anyways, this movie will move you to tears with its all around brilliant and believable performances - especially at its dramatic and painful conclusion.<p>Well done!! This is one of the few movies that was worthy of all the hype.</p></body></html>

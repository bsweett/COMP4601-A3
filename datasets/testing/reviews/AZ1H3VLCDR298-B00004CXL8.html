<meta name="summary" content="A great film of human triumph; this is a true gem."></head><body><p>This movie is absolutely one of the best movies to come around in a long time. It goes down to the deepest levels of the human spirit, and triumphs. Jack Nicholson gives his best performance since &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot; and really shows us that anybody can become a better person. He plays a romance novelist who has Obessesive Compulsive Disorder with an attitude less than human at times. People around him think he is just another jerk, but with his disorder he is usually not aware he is offending people, until it is too late. I have OCD myself, and after having seen this movie with my family, I have been compared to him in many ways. I can control it most of the time now, but this Nicholson's character Melvin Yudall does not realize he is affecting people negatively (or even cares) until late in his life. He is really just a lonely man with no friends, who isolates himself in his apartment when he writes, and has very little social skills. Greg Kinnear plays his neighbor who dislikes him greatly, for reasons shown in the film.(Kinnear gives an outstanding performance and should have won the Oscar for best supporting actor that year) He plays a man who after a brutal attack directed at him must come to grips with himself again and regain his self-worth. Also featured is Helen Hunt, who gives a wonderful performance as the waitress who waits on Nicholson at his favorite diner. The character development grows between Nicholson and Hunt and Kinnear and Nicholson until eventually all three story lines intersect. Some of you may not have seen this film yet, so I won't give away any of the details. But let me tell you as someone who has been there, and has felt the same feelings and desires as Melvin, that this movie gave me a lot of inspiration and hope that I pray will be felt by many others with the same situation. This is a feel-good movie, with rich, detailed characters portrayed by actors who fit into the roles like a glove. This movie was nominated for many oscars, but this was the Year of Titanic, and pulled away with best actor and actress nods for Nicholson and Hunt. When you watch this movie, you actually feel for these 3 people, and you want them to be happy with their lives, which is what's missing from many movies these days. James L. Brooks, who is at his finest, co-wrote and directed this movie with such spirit. This film is a triumph, on many levels.</p></body></html>

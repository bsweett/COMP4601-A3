<meta name="summary" content="Yo Adrian, he did it again...as long as Stallone is alive, so is Rocky"></head><body><p>I didn't expect much out of this move. Rocky V was hard to stomach, well, actually anything after rocky II was not easy.  But Stallone put together a decent movie here. I admit, it moved slowly at first, and I did get kinda sick of all the reminicing and wanted more boxing, but hey, it did deliver in the end, and it true rocky style.  Talia Shire, Adrian, was not in this movie, but much of the movie revolved around her spirit.  I wonder if after rocky V she said she'd rather be dead than be in another rocky movie.  Well, now she probably wants her publisist dead for not getting her into it.  Oh well, the movie is decent, good action, and good message. And his son Robert, all grown up, but how do he escape the shadow of a champ...learn to become one yourself. Good movie entertainment, Rocky fans enjoy.</p></body></html>

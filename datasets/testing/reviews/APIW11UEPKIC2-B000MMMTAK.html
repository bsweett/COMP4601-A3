I am going to tell you right off the bat that if you are going to be offended by Borat kissing his sister, this is not for you.  If you are going to be offended by Borat showing everyone(and you)his son's junk, you will not want to see this.  Now if you are looking for a nude male fight scene that is a hundred times even more gross, then you have found your movie.<br /><br />You have probably seen 'Da Ali G Show' on HBO, you will know Borat as the idiot reporter from Kazakhstan.  We actually get to see his town for the first time I believe and it was a real treat.  Now the thing tha I really loved about thsi movie was that it didn't try to be a movie.  It does try to make a couple of plot points but doesn't worry about them.  It gives itself every oppurtunity possible to tell a joke.  This guy will truly do ANYTHING for a laugh.  Unlike the HBO show, a few parts do feel a bit staged.  This is not a bad thing because I promise you that the finale is totally orinigal and I did not expect it one bit.  And of course the nude fight scene cannot be missed.  It is hard to look at but once you have seen it, it is impossible to look away.</p></body></html>

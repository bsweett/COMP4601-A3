<meta name="summary" content="Funnier, Funner and Cooler than Get Shorty"></head><body><p>Ok this movie is low on plot with the little plot it having being lame. Plus basically it just jumps from one thing to another. Still though I don't know how Roger Ebert could just dismiss it with a * 1/2 review. The supporting cast is hilarious and they make the movie very enjoyable. John Travolta and Uma Thurman are just cool in their roles and add some class to the movie. While everyone else is having a good time goofing off and getting paid for it.<br /><br />  The Rock is great as a bodyguard who wants to be an actor and who's also just a little....fruity. In his movies you just think of him as...The Rock. Here he blends in as an actor with guys like John Travolta and Vince Vaughn. He shows his comic talents and shows he has a much brighter career ahead of him than just being brainless action films. Vince Vaughn is also very funny as a wannabe hip-pop gangster named Raji.<br /><br />  He's fighting with Travolta over the contract of a new talented singer. So that's what the whole plot is basically. Chili Palmer "Travolta" decides he wants to get into making music instead of movies. He finds a new singer and decides to make her a star. I found the movie plot in Get Shorty to be better. Shorty is just a better movie because it's more original and better made. I find most of the music scenes to last too long because they aren't the strong points of the film or what make it good. You feel like saying ok stop singing I  just want to laugh more.<br /><br />  This movie has a lot of funny and odd ideas and the cast pulls them off great. I mean the Rock has the best and weirdest material I've seen in a movie in years. His character won't admit he's gay yet he does a music video singing a Dolly Pardon song. Also when he auditions in front of Travolta he chooses to reinact a cheerleader scene from Bring It On. The Rock is a gonna be big and he shows that here. I mean Vin Diesel makes a joke out of himself by trying comedy in the Pacifer. While the Rock shows here he can do whatever he chooses to do and he can handle it perfectly.  Plus Travolta is also better than he has been in years here. Is sad though that all him and Uma get to do after awhile is bob there heads to a song they like. So don't see the movie just to see them reunite because you might be disapointed. This is a weak character for Thurman especially after being so damn good as the Bride in the Kill Bill movies. Just go if you want a good laugh from the supporting cast.</p></body></html>

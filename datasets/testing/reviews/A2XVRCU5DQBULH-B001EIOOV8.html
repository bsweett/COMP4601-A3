<meta name="summary" content="In many ways, better than &quot;Goodfellas&quot;..."></head><body><p>The trio of director Martin Scorcese and actors Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci are back in this fast-paced slam-banger that gets better by the minute and never lets up until the very end. Those who like casino and/or gangster movies will find sheer joy in this film about both. Scorcese has proved himself to be a truly remarkable director and this film shows why. He knows how to handle characters, scenes and even adds in a few of his own tricks. Many have cited this to be a copy of &quot;Goodfellas,&quot; but this isn't true at all. Sure, it has some of the qualities that made &quot;Goodfellas&quot; so cool, but &quot;Casino&quot; is its own movie doing its own thing. Acting: everyone here is excellent. Of course, DeNiro and Pesci are absolutely remarkable, but so is Sharon Stone as DeNiro's wife. While the film runs at about three hours, it feels much shorter due to a fast pace and a relentlessly thorough screenplay. This ranks as one of Martin Scorcese's best films.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The "two minute" warning. Lee Tamahori's NEXT film"></head><body><p>Cris Johnson ,a two-bit Las Vegas magician whose "nom de plume" is Frankie Cadillac, has a most unusual gift since birth: he sees two minutes into the future.It has served him handily at gambling and other things such as wrestling a gun from a would-be shooter,etc.  but Cris (Nicholas Cage) has been picked apart for this gift all his life and he wants to be left alone with it.Enter FBI operative Callie Ferris (the ever lovely Julianne Moore)who,following Cris for a while, tries to convince him to work in cahoots with her and the Bureau to reach a nuclear bomb before annihilation occurs.Cris goes on the run and encounters first, Lizzie (Jessica Biel) a really ridiculously good character who helps underprivileged children, and secondly the terrorists who want to find  Cris so that their  plans to blow up everything are not thwarted.I submit that this is an accurate yet superficial plot summary.<br /><br />Apart from the neat concept of the "two minutes ahead" theory, this film just has so many holes in it, that as in time-travelish films a certain degree of belief has to be suspended.This requires way more suspension  than that! Moore's character has figured out the "two minute" thing.We never know how. Cris' powers become way more advanced in Biel's presence.No clue-never explained.The "terrorists" want to blow things up, but we are never told  to why .Is two minutes warning really enough time in the first place to even defuse this bomb? The worst part,though, are the endless chases that Cage endures.Once or twice is fine,but it gets a little predictable and ho-hum after a while,and Cage NEVER even looks tired!<br /><br />NEXT is nothing at all special.It may engage and entertain for a while,but little more than that. Cage,Moore and Biel have done so much better work with better material.The biggest surprise to me was that this was a product of director Lee Tamahori whose STATE OF THE UNION and DIE ANOTHER DAY were so taught.NEXT had me simply saying,I hope what's next is better than this.I can't see two minutes ahead.</p></body></html>

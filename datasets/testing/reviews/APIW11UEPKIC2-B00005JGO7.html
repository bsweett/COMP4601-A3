<meta name="summary" content="The most fun I have ever had watching a movie"></head><body><p>I can't say that Snatch is my favorite movie of alltime, but it's up there.  It has the most perfect cast imaginable, one of the best soundtracks, and a super slick directing style that makes you wish the movie would never end.  There's a lot going on in the movie, but it all comes down to everybody chasing a diamond.  To be honest I hardly ever thought abotu the diamond.  I was too busy laughing at all the great lines from all the great characters.  Bullet Tooth Tony has to be the coolest guy alive, Brad Pitt's character can't speak a word without getting me to laugh outloud, and the rest of the characters are all extremely entertaining.  Usually I would rate a movie as good if there are 1 or 2 characters I like, but Snatch has like 10.<br /><br />Rating- 5/5<br /><br />I have tried so many times to do a review for this movie, and I have failed once again, but this time I will let you read my rambling.</p></body></html>

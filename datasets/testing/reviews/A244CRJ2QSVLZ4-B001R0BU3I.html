<meta name="summary" content="Believed To Be A Traitor, Samir Horn Is Caught Between A Rock And A Hard Place (Great Film and Great Release From Anchor Bay)"></head><body><p>Indeed, as the tagline for "Traitor" states, the truth is complicated.  As the film progresses, it becomes ever more complicated.  Soon Samir Horn, the traitor, is unable to tell anyone the truth about who he really is.  He is trapped in many prisons, both physical and spiritual, and is being pulled in many directions.<br /><br />  I am reviewing the Anchor Bay release of "Traitor."  Normally, I don't watch the DVD's special features; however, "Traitor" was so intriguing that I couldn't resist.  The commentary provided by director Jeffrey Nachmanoff (screenwriter of "The Day After Tomorrow") and lead actor Don Cheadle (who portrayed Samir Horn) was outstanding.  During many commentaries, the actors and production crew reminisce about past events that have nothing to do with the film.  Not so with "Traitor."  I soon learned that the Yemen scenes were filmed in beautiful Morocco.  Nachmanoff foolhardily didn't get a permit to film in London's subways.  Cheadle was clipped by a car while being filmed crossing a street.  Many of the Moroccan extras used in the prison scenes couldn't speak English but were fine actors in their own right.  Several Muslim actors gave advice on Muslim customs and beliefs that were incorporated into the film.  Nachmanoff's younger brother, a lawyer, gave him legal jargon for the film.  I also learned that Cheadle and Guy Pearce are very athletic and did a lot of their own stunts.  Most importantly, Nachmanoff stated how he wanted to focus on the journey that Samir Horn undertakes rather than the ultimate act of terrorism at the film's finale.  Don Cheadle so aptly describes his character as being ". . . Caught between a rock and a hard place."<br /><br />  The commentary was also educational.  I learned that Nachmanoff distinguished certain scenes from others by using the bleached bypass process which gives a scene a lighter, bleached-out look.  (Personally, I didn't care for this effect.)  Some buildings were extended by using CGI.  Cranes were used to create unusual overhead camera angles.<br /><br />  In order to give "Traitor" an international flavor, the film was shot in Morocco, London, Toronto, Marseilles, Chicago, and Washington D.C.  The viewer will appreciate and learn more about these locales, especially those in Morocco, if they watch the DVD`s special feature:  "International Espionage:  An In-Depth Look at Traitor's Exotic Locations."  (Morocco is gorgeous; I'd love to go there on vacation.)  It was interesting to learn that few sets were built.  Most scenes were filmed by small crews on location.<br /><br />  The viewer will see Cheadle train for the prison fight scenes in "Action!  The Stunts and Special Effects of Traitor."  This short feature was exceptionally fun to watch.  We learn that Cheadle has a background in fighting.  We witness cars and buildings explode.  We also learn how the stunt is performed when a young terrorist is thrown off a bridge and onto the train tracks below.<br /><br />  Overall, the features for the Anchor Bay release of "Traitor" are excellent.  My only complaints was that there isn't a special feature that provides the deleted scenes.  Cheadle and Nachmanoff spoke about them, making me wish I could view them.  Also, the print for the names of locations was very small.  I had to scoot closer to the television to see them.  Same with the subtitles for those speaking in Arabic.  You had to look hard and pay close attention because they were small and were soon gone.  Also, Anchor Bay's release didn't have a reproduction of the movie poster like so many others have had.  However, I am thankful that there are English subtitles for the hearing impaired, like myself, and the film is presented in anamorphic widescreen with an aspect ratio of 1.78:1.  Inside the DVD jewel case, there are two $3 coupons that can be used towards the purchases of "Righteous Kill" and "Surfer, Dude."  (I have scanned and posted the DVD jacket, the coupons, and the disc.)  Also, the trailers included on the disc are for the following features:  "Righteous Kill" (looks like an excellent police saga starring Al Pacino and Robert Deniro), "The Visitor" (great drama, which I have already reviewed), "Henry Poole is Here" (looks bizarre but warmhearted), and "Sleepwalking" (another sweet drama I'd like to see.)<br /><br />  As far as the film itself, I have not seen a more emotionally charged story dealing with terrorism since "The Siege."  Everyone gave excellent performances, especially Don Cheadle who deserves an Oscar.  His facial expressions were incredible.  I felt a lot of sympathy for his character, Samir Horn.  He is torn between his loyalty towards Islam and loyalty towards his country.  Most everyone thinks he's a traitor, including himself.  He begins to think that he has betrayed Islam for the innocent lives that have been lost.  To make matters worse, he virtually has no one to turn to but Allah.  Horn's mom, however, seems to have faith that he is still a good man.<br /><br />  Anchor Bay`s release of "Traitor" is highly recommended viewing for those who enjoy political espionage thrillers.  You will be on the edge of your seat for the last fifteen minutes, as I was.  My heart was pounding in my chest.  The ending was a shocker.<br /><br />Wa alaikum assalam.</p></body></html>

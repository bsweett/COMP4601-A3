<meta name="summary" content="Darker Matt, Lighter Elektra"></head><body><p>I was there when the Daredevil series hit the Elektra saga and the excitement that Miller &amp; Janson had already brought to the moribund series was incredible.  The mature story arcs with adult themes and actual character deaths were handled in a way not seen before in mainstream comics and put that group of artistic works over the top.  Daredevil the movie borrows liberally from that timeframe, after developing the lengthy back story of Matt Murdock's `blinding and awakening'.  I frankly didn't mind Affleck as Matt Murdock.  He certainly played him a lot more tortured than I remember from the Miller era. Duncan as Wilson Fisk aka the Kingpin, also interesting but manageable.  Colin Farrell as Bullseye and Jennifer Garner as Elektra round out the cast nicely.  The final death scene of Elektra is hauntingly familiar to fans of the comics, Bullseye uses the same dialogue leading up to `but me, I'm magic..' and who can forget that impaling on the sai with the tip extended through the body but not the clothes, making a small tent.  Yikes.  Garner doesn't bring the darkness inherent in Elektra out, but she actually did a pretty good job if you don't bring any preconceptions into the theatre.  I actually thought it was a pretty good film within in the confines of what it attempts to do.</p></body></html>

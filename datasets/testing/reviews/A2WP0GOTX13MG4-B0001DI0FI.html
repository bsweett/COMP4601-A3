<meta name="summary" content="Surprise--In More Ways than One"></head><body><p>In 'Master and Commander,'  Russell Crowe plays Captain Aubrey of the HMS Surprise.  Aubrey has received orders to take the Surprise and her crew to the South Atlantic, off the coast of South America to pursue the Acheron, a French vessel.  The Acheron's captain has been given a letter of marque to act as a privateer for the French, and is commandeering British ships as prizes.<br /><br />Aubrey's ship is not the only 'Surprise' in the movie.  Right off the bat, the French ship surprises Aubrey and his men, causing them to flee the French ship.  The attack leads the crew to dub the Acheron 'The Phantom.'  We come to discover that the Acheron is a new type of vessel, constructed in a way that it is superior in design, speed, and firepower to the Surprise.<br /><br />The biggest surprise comes in the movies climax, as Aubrey and the crew of the Surprise engage the Acheron for the final time.  This is some of the finest naval warfare captured on film.  Few movies equal the cinematography of the clash between the two crews.  The only draw back to the scene is that it is often difficult to tell the two crews apart.  In addition, many of the characters have similar hair styles and costumes, so it is often confusing as to who was just stabbed, shot, or slew an enemy.<br /><br />After Russell Crowe, the character receiving the most attention is Dr. Stephen Maturin, the ship's surgeon.  Maturin is played by Paul Bettany.  Unlike the rest of the crew, Maturin's skills do not lie in combat or sailing, but in medicine and the natural sciences.  Much is made of his being a naturalist, and the lessons he gives to a young naval officer resound throughout the movie.  His character is a great foil for Aubrey as he is more conservative and thoughtful.<br /><br />'Master and Commander' is a very enjoyable film.  It falls just short of getting five stars because it borders on being just a bit too long.  In addition, portions of the film remind the observant viewer of 'Moby Dick' (substitute the Acheron for a whale) and 'Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner' (a large gull follows the ship and leads to some key scenes).  I haven't read the books, so I cannot discuss how the movie stacks up.  One last warning, there are some medical scenes after the first battle that the squemish would be best served by getting a friend to tell them whens it over.  I give this movie a good recommendation.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="typical American action film"></head><body><p>John McClane (Bruce Willis) is back. He must find hacker Matthew Farrell (Justin Long) to track down Thomas Gabriel and his Internet terrorist network before Gabriel's team shuts down the USA completely.<br /><br />So many flaws in the script, I don't even know where to start.<br /><br />Despite its flaws and errors, this is a typical American action film with Bruce Willis where the bad guys, of course, are foreigners, and McClane saves the hacker, his daughter and all go home happy - more or less.<br />A nice discovery: Justin Long in a serious role, and not his usual comedy.<br /><br />What else can be said about this action film... it's action-packed, and it's a real film for GUYS.<br /><br />Fun entertainment.</p></body></html>

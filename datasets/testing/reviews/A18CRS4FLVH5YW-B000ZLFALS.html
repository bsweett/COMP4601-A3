<meta name="summary" content="This movie is painful to listen to.  Steer clear of this dreck!"></head><body><p>This movie insults the music of The Beatles and musicals in general.  This movie fails to provide even one remote reason to indulge in any of these characters.  The songs are familiar but the music has been "modernized" to the point where it doesn't improve on anything.  Xanadu at least had original songs and of course the beautiful Olivia Newton-John on roller skates.  How can you beat that??  LOL.  Stay away from this overhyped pile of junk.  The Bono cameo is laughable at best and thankfully this movie didn't do so well in theatres so it won't ruin his career too badly!</p></body></html>

It reminded me most of the Ridley Scott ad for Nike that ran one time, during the 1984 Super Bowl, where a young athlete flung a hammer through a television screen featuring Big Brother.<br /><br />While hardly a masterpiece, "V for Vendetta" is certainly better and more entertaining than "The Island", the last modern film I saw that addressed mass hysteria, mass mind control, and oppression.<br /><br />The hero is a masked character in a round hat and cape named V, a victim of a government biochemical experiment gone bad, who is out for revenge against those that did him wrong in totalitarian England. He manages to do things no one could realistically do -- control all television in England for his message, fight off a dozen armed guards at a time, etc. -- but still makes his point in a world where apparently everyone watched HDTV.<br /><br />Aside from getting even with the 10 people on his list, V sets out to lead a counterrevolution to regain democracy, or so he says; he appears in most scenes to be more despotic than democratic. The film revolves around his exploits, his friendship with a like-minded young woman, and the government's inability to corral him.<br /><br />The characterizations in this film are all one-dimensional, almost cartoonish, but that does not detract from the involvement or enjoyment aspects of the fantasy. It's kind of like Woddy Allen's "Bananas" played straight, without the laughs. If you enjoyed any of the aforementioned films I'm sure you'll enjoy "V for Vendetta".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Disturbing Tale of Gore and Guts"></head><body><p>A man named Frank Cotton opens an exotic puzzle box, hoping that it will open the doorways to the pleasures of either heaven or hell. What he got was the pain and torture of hell. After spending some time dormant in the  floor boards of an upstairs attic, he is resurrected by the blood of his  brother, and must feast on more blood to become fully whole again. This  movie which was scripted and directed by horror writter Clive  Barker has  been highly regarded as a horror classic. Its loaded with blood and guts  and comes with quite an interesting plot. Very entertaining and watchable.  Based on the novel 'The Hellbound Heart' by Clive Barker.</p></body></html>

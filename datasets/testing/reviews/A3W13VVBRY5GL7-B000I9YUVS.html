<meta name="summary" content="Miserable"></head><body><p>Truly, this is the worst film I've seen so far in 2006. And I've seen some stinkers.<br /><br />So, basically, "The Fog" stars a whole bunch of "That-Guy-Looks-Familiar" C-List Television Actors (Oh! And Selma Blair, too...) in a whole bunch of "This-Scene-Feels-Familiar" situations. A nasty pea-souper of a fog, containing 100% of a small town's Recommended Daily Allowance of Vengeful Ghosts, threatens one night to destroy the small island community of Generic, and it's up to Buff White Male Hero Under Thirty to try and save his loved ones from a fate worse than... ...having to star in this movie.<br /><br />If I sound sarcastic, it's because I have every right to be: moronic dialogue, confusing and plodding editing and totally bland, insipid performances by all the cast members make this remake of "The Fog" a real slap in the face for those of us foolish enough to watch it. Nothing feels genuine and nothing gels together to create a sense of plausible fear: we've seen all of this before, and, in most cases, done far better. Small coastal towns are a great setting for eerie, chilling tales - 'Dolores Claiborne', 'Treasure Island', 'The Wicker Man', and many others, including  the original version of this movie prove that point - but in the case of this remake, the setting, as with pretty much all elements of the movie, seems to provide a merely perfunctory backdrop for the mundanest of mundane special effects, and the cheapest of cheap shocks.<br /><br />If this miserably inept 'effort' is where Hollywood intends to take the Horror genre, then it's high time to quit. I, for one, am sick to the back teeth of having my intelligence insulted by lazy, pointless film-making.<br /><br />Avoid this like the plague.</p></body></html>

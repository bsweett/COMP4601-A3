But the films they have directed I haven't liked one bit.  This is the first film that they have directed that I really think is worth seeing.  Its only fatal flaw in my mind is Scarlett Johansson.  She is an incredibly overrated actress in my humble opinion and she really sinks the pic.  Had a better actress been cast in her role I think the film would have worked so much better.  Its sad too because Dennis Quaid gives an admirable performance, truly brilliant at times as does Topher Grace who seems to get better and better with every film I see him in.  Marg Helgenberger from CSI is also quite good in this film.  David Paymer is great as well as Frankie Faison in their respective supporting roles.  The story is quite interesting as well...I just thought that Johannson really hurt the film in a crucial role.  SPOILER AHEAD There is an important scene in the film towards the end in a restaraunt where Quaid discovers that Johansson his daughter has been sleeping with his boss played by Grace and the scene winds up not really carrying of the dramatic weight it could have because of her lack of range and emotionaly sincerity.  Quaid is giving his all in the scene and acting wise she's just whatever about the whole thing.  An unfortunate let down that kept me from really loving the film.  But that said its worth seeing just for the story, Dennis Quaid and his fascinating interactions with Topher Grace who is completely on his game throughout.  Why did they have to cast Johansson in that role though?  Big mistake.</p></body></html>

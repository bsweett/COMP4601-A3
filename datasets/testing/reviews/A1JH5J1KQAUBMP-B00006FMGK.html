<meta name="summary" content="Couldn't satisfy even this devoted Trek fan"></head><body><p>The crew of the Enterprise-E squares off against the evil Shinzon (Tom Hardy), who, with the aid of a powerful starship, is out to settle a score against both Romulus and Earth.  Finally, a TNG movie allows some change--actually, quite a bit of change--in the lives and circumstances of our characters rather than returning them all to the kind of eternal stasis that is common to episodic television.  This is a quality that always made the classic Trek films feel like events--Kirk was promoted off his ship, Spock died, the Enterprise was destroyed, etc.  TNG films have always gotten that wrong, right from the first one, in which they were still flying around in the same ship and wearing the same uniforms from the TV series.  Now Berman and Co. seem to have finally clued in to that fact, but it feels like too little too late.<p>Final verdict: this is a passable but disappointing adventure.  Some good action is undermined by dark sets and a stagy feel to the proceeding.  And what's up with Worf?  He has been returned to duty aboard the Enterprise without explanation, although the finale of the Deep Space 9 series showed him becoming a liaison between the Federation and the Klingon Empire.  It's a shame that the filmmakers chose to ignore that logical and well-developed bit of character evolution just so that he could stand around in the background for one more tired film.</p></body></html>

Of the films I've seen in the new millennium, "There Will Be Blood" stands out as the most "artful"--a nuanced, complex, serious piece of moviemaking that pulls out all the stops--scripting, acting, and cinematography (above all, the creative, even daring, use of montage and mis en scene to "tell the story" rather than the usual reliance on script, close-ups, and talking heads).  By contrast, "Gran Torino" breaks no new ground and demands far less of its viewer as a reader of film per se: instead, it demands a viewer who can handle a serious social issue and accept as "heroes" characters largely viewed as non-sympathetic by the majority of the American public.  But above all, "Gran Torino" required a director with Eastwood's deep convictions about fair play and his sympathies with the underdog--so much so that he was willing to put his name and money on the line regardless of the outcome at the box office.<br /><br />I viewed the film at the recommendation of my son, who no doubt was, like most viewers, initially attracted to it by the title.  Equally certain is that he, like most viewers, was moved by more than the car (though it's a nice car, not unlike a few big old Fords we've had in the family).  But the actual subjects in this film are tolerance, redemption and community--and Eastwood, as is his custom, finds it in an unlikely place--or rather, among an unfamiliar people--the much misunderstood, maligned, and even demonized Hmong people.  Clint's character is that of a crusty old Korean war veteran who interprets the world around him according to the bible of Archie Bunker, stereotyping people at every opportunity, cracking politically-incorrect jokes, and talking in a profane and scatological argot ironically not unlike that of the young minority gang-bangers he views as a nemesis. The primary "action" is not the predictable violence, beating and shooting stemming from the vigilante justice that is a trademark of Eastwood films but the conversion of Clint from flint to "father"--not of his distant, materialistic biological children but of a Hmong boy who suffers from low self-esteem while seeking significance and stability among even his own people.  Eastwood's character and the Hmong boy (originally an unwelcome neighbor who lives next door to the recently widowed Eastwood who, with the exception of his old dog Daisy, experiences a chosen isolation not all that different from the boy's).  Eventually, Eastwood becomes a virtual family member among the Hmongs and gets the son he never had (though at the price of his life), and the Hmong boy in turn gets an affirming father along with the latter's coveted '72 Gran Torino and, through his newly acquired self-confidence, the Hmong girl he had been too shy to look at, much less go after.<br /><br />These are commendable sentiments, and even without the twist of the Hmong neighbors, Eastwood's skills both as a director and actor assure a result that rises above the plot of what is basically a formulaic film, with a number of developments most likely conveyed to a good share of the audience well before they occur.  What's somewhat regrettable is the appearance of the film at a time when the nation is so splintered (bifurcated, may be the word) into two camps, one respecting poltical process and the highest office, the other seemingly thinking some sort of vigilante justice is a defense against terrorism rather than a contributor to it.  It's appalling to read polls suggesting that half of the nation has regressed to two "basic needs": Give me my guns, and don't tax me.  Even more disturbing is reading of political rallies to which people are drawn while packing firearms.  (Undeniably, that's one solution to the current problems with the economy and its failure to provide sufficient jobs: kill enough people, and eventually demand will come into closer alignment with supply.)<br /><br />In literature courses, teachers often try to discourage students from falling victim to the "intentional fallacy" ("Shakespeare wrote to entertain theater-goers and REALLY meant to say to be or not to be a ticket buyer is the question"; or "You're making too big a deal out of the poem.  Maybe all Frost meant to say was that he went on a walk, came to a fork, and took the less-traveled one to be different.").  But once a literary piece (or film) is born, it takes on a life of its own.  Attempts to read the author's mind are naiive, presumptuous and beside the point.  So even though Eastwood's character ends up with a cigarette lighter in his right hand rather than the magnum pistol it's assumed he's reaching for, the strange hold that guns have, especially on Americans, the potential of guns to "equalize" us all, quickly and decisively, is a stronger, more lingering image, I'm afraid, than the restored Gran Torino.  If Eastwood makes one more film (he had vowed before "Gran Torino" to do no more acting), I can't imagine a stronger, more valuable or memorable closer than a movie exposing guns for the anachronisms they have become in a civilized society.  But given his love of jazz and American music, I know that he would support, instead of guns in young people's hands, a musical instrument, preferably one that is not a synthesizer.<br /><br />I viewed the film in Blu Ray, though Eastwood's preference for a "noirish" cast, even to his color tones (witness a first-class Eastwood film noir gem like "Tightrope" from 1985), makes normal DVD an equally compelling choice.<br /><br />[Coda: An undeniable item of curiosity (apart from its critical importance to the plot) is the cigarette lighter that replaces the handgun in Eastwood's final scene.  At a point midway in the film we see him coughing up blood, and a comment by the Hmong boy (or is it his sister?) that he should stop smoking strongly implies that he's suffering from lung cancer (given his stubborn character, a doctor would be the last to know).  So either way--a gun or a lighter--the object in his left shirt pocket is emblematic of his end, the only question being whether it will be instantaneous or prolonged. It's even plausible that he knows his days are numbered and chooses what he believes is the best way out for all concerned.]</p></body></html>

As Campbell plays him, Ash is certainly unhinged; anyone who'd chop off his hand and replace it with a chainsaw isn't exactly sparking on all cylinders. <p> This time out, Ash finds himself transported to a strangely barren medieval England where he battles his own evil dead doppelganger for possession of a magic book that can send him back to his own era... and his job at &quot;S-Mart.&quot; Lots of knights versus skeletons mayhem ensues. <p> This is just some popcorn-munchin' entertainment, perfect for getting together with a six-pack of brew and some friends and letting director Sam Raimi and Campbell take you along for the fun. It features some nice effects- they strike the perfect balance between state-of-the-art and gorgonzola, just right for this cheeky film. The script is a hoot, with a lot of B-movie style one-liners perfectly delivered by Campbell. There's even a funny tribute to &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still.&quot; <p> Underappreciated by the public at large, but well-worth your time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Anti -- anti-war view"></head><body><p>Clearly Eastwood attempted to make an anti-war film equivalent to "All Quiet ON The Western Front" but he failed.  The film was intended to humanize the Japanese and was very politically correct since it showed the Japanese in a very positive light while showing the Americans as brutal.  The scene where the American soldiers shot the prisoners was totally out of context and clearly placed there to reinforce the usual Hollywood view of the American Military.  The film failed to show or even indicate any of the brutality or inhumanity shown by the Japanese to their prisoners or even civilians.  This was a sad film but very one-sided and even distorted since it failed to show the actual conduct of the Japanese outside of the futility of the Bushido code.  The Japanese soldiers were shown as reluctant soldiers who were actually being victimized by their leaders and the Bushido code, while the few views of the Americans showed them as murderers.<br /><br />I usually avoid all Hollywood films dealing with the military because they are always anti-military and anti-American military in particular and this film was no different.  It was well done from a techical viewpoint and for that reason I gave it four stars but if you have ever been in the American Military this is just another backhanded slap at soldiers.  It is an anti-war film but it never shows any context for the war or the consequences of not fighting.<br /><br />Actually this could be seen as an anti-anti-war film because it can be viewed as a lesson in siege warfare.  It is an excellent examination of the practical problems facing the commander of a fortress when put under siege.  It demonstrates that the commander can only last as long as his supplies and must be relieved from outside.  A failure to gain relief can only result in an erosion of morale and loss of effectiveness.  From the that perspective this was a good training film.<br /><br />But in the end this was just another Hollywood film that once agains shows that Hollywood believes war is an American invention and that all that is needed is talk and a few choruses of Kumbaya.</p></body></html>

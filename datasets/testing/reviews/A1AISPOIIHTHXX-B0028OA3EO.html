However, there were just some things that were merely uninteresting, slightly long or just unnecessary. Part II was actually surprisingly good while the less said about III and IV is for everyone's benefit. Stuck in development hell for the better part of a decade, the film finally got lifted off the ground when Bryan Singer, director of the Usual Suspects and first 2 X-Men films came onboard. Thankfully, the ideas of Doomsday riding a mechanical spider have been exorcised and we have a solid entry into the series that will probably disappoint some.<br /><br />It's been 5 years since Superman disappeared, searching for the remains of his home planet, Krypton. Returning, he finds the world is still in trouble and moreso, his love Lois Lane has moved on, with evidence in the Pulitzer winning article "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman". Not only that, but Lex Luthor is out of jail and he's got a mind for another land deal which of course puts the entire United States at risk. And so of course, Superman has to contend with not only Luthor but a woman who doesn't love him anymore and a responsibility that he abandoned.<br /><br />It's slightly eerie at how Superman's career has always been in direct competition or level as DC Comics' other hero, Batman. They both had an excellent first film, a pretty good second film with the next 2 being absolute duds, the worst being the 4th. Superman Returns is like the Batman Begins of the series, only it doesn't restart the series so much as it puts it back on track. Ignoring part III and IV, the film is essentially the "real" Superman III, taking place after II. Is this better than the first one? Relatively speaking I like it better but only by a bit. Newcomer Brandon Routh, while looking a bit too similar to Christopher Reeve, is perfect as bumbling nervous Clark and hero of the Earth, Superman. I never liked Gene Hackman's wisecracking portrayal of Luthor and Spacey manages to have that menace he needed while also providing some humor.(Some of it unintentional: "wrong!") While the rest of the cast is fine, the one misfire is Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane. She doesn't give a bad performance really, it's just Lois is supposed to be a feisty gal born out of woman's liberation movement while she plays it as a soft-spoken damsel in distress at times.<br /><br />Well it's a Superman movie so do we get to see superhero stuff? Naturally. Probably the best action scene of the year, Superman has to save a maiden voyage of an airplane attached to a space shuttle has they careen towards space and Earth. It's exciting, energetic and just plain awesome. The rest of the stuff he does is not as ambitious but it's certainly no less cool, bringing out the geek in us that loves to see guys lift up 10 tonne globes. The one thing though is that the effects at times look slightly obvious. The flying though has never been better(except for a really bad digital double shot at the end), with the cape finally have some wind in it, unlike 1978's cape where it just flopped down his legs. Shot on the Genesis HD camera, the film looked sharp in theatre and most likely will on next-gen players but on DVD they look slightly too obvious or grainy. Is the film too long? At times, but it gives the film much needed character moments without being a teenybopper superhero movie for the masses(such as Fantastic Four).<br /><br />Batman Begins to me at times didn't feel exciting, as if it looked exciting but it didn't keep me enthralled. Superman Returns did, only the length and ANOTHER Luthor land mass scheme made it knock down a point or 2 but this is another one on the list for best comic book hero films, and it's about time too.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Van Helsing was overkill  :("></head><body><p>I love monsters, and i thought this movie would be awesome!  Although the creatures/monster are awesome, i just felt like the movie was just "OK." It just didn't keep me captivated.  I like Hugh Jackman, especially as Wolverine, but this is just so typically aweful at times.  Kate Beckinsale is a good actress and she was a highlight to the movie, but it was just cheesy, I'm sorry to say that is movie was a disappointment to me, but if you love monsters/creature of the Old, this is a movie for you, it just wasn't for me.  It would of been nice to just have one monster per movie maybe, but it was just too much.  Sometimes less is more!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the worst in the series unless you watch the directors cut"></head><body><p>Alien? is the worst in the series because of the studio. David Fincehr had a dark film in his mind but the studio cut it down. The film does have a few good scares and the cinematography is cool. But the film is very slowly paced and most viewers won't be able to take it.</p></body></html>

How could it be?<br /><br />Nick Naylor is one of the most interesting protagonists to come along in quite a while, and the topic is a very blunt "smoke smoke smoke!" message.  The movie is based on a novel which I haven't read but which must surely also be about him.  He's an interesting guy.<br /><br />What I see here is a brilliant balancing act.  The humor manages to go over the top without ever sacrificing character, credibility, or even plot.  I honestly didn't expect a plot, but rather a one-joke film.  So it was a pleasant surprise there.<br /><br />I will say that you have to be in the right mood, though.  The first time I fired up the DVD, I stopped after about 30 minutes and put it aside for later.  The second time, I was very impressed.<br /><br />(Fired up?  Oh no, I've been subliminally programmed!)</p></body></html>

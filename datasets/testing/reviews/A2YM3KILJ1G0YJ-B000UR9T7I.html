<meta name="summary" content="Mary Jane is a snaggle-toothed whore, and a lousy singer, too"></head><body><p>So, Spidey gets a little mean in this one.  I'd say it has half as much to do with the symbiotic alien life form known as Venom that attaches itself to him, and half to do with Mary Jane's hedonistic, prostitutorial ways.  Allow me to explain...<br /><br />While Spidey is solving crime, risking his life, and being a hero, he still has to deal with family and a girlfriend.  And his cult hero status - something won with much difficulty - doesn't seem to sit well with Mary Jane.  During a celebration of Spiderman saving the day once again, along with the life of a beautiful young blonde who makes Mary Jane look like a ginger hobo, the attention Spiderman gets is just a bit too much.  She can't stand someone else being the center of attention, and since she got her little feewings hurt by getting fired from a musical, she was looking to redirect the pain.  Spidey gets a celebratory kiss and Mary Jane, being the whore she is, cheats on Spiderman without any sympathy whatsoever.  Seriously, who cheats on Spiderman!?<br /><br />Unfortunately, she also helps to turn Spidey into a complete idiot, prancing around like a complete retard and making a fool of himself in front of every attractive woman he sees.  He pops his collar and gets an emo haircut, and is obviously emotionally damaged.  Luckily, he takes a date to Mary Jane's place of employment and teases her unmercifully, and she deserves every second of it.<br /><br />Along the way Spidey continues the battle versus the legacy of the Green Goblin, as well as the Sandman, and the aforementioned Venom (with new host).  Tons of action, great special effects, and the perpetual cameos of Stan Lee are all present.<br /><br />I loved the movie; it was an incredible comic adaptation, but I obviously hated Mary Jane.</p></body></html>

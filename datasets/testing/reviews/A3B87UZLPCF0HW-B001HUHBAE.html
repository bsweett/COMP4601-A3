<meta name="summary" content="The JFK of serial killer movies"></head><body><p>After the lukewarm Panic Room, it's back to business for Fincher with Zodiac. A grandiose, sprawling movie, Zodiac documents the efforts San Francisco police went through to bring down its most notorious killer. Moving from the viewpoint of the victims, to detectives Toschi (Ruffalo) and Armstrong (Edwards), to the Zodiac-obsessed Chronicle cartoonist Graysmith (Gyllenhaal) and alcoholic reporter Avery (Downey Jr.), Fincher and writer James Vanderbilt (who adapted Robert Graysmith's book) leave no stone unturned in the hunt for the killer. So meticulous is their approach, to call Zodiac a slow burner is a major understatement, as in-depth analyses of crime scenes follow careful examination of the killer's psyche. Kicking off in 1968 and finishing up in the late '80s while simultaneously encompassing a whole host of fleshed-out characters and dead end plotlines, Fincher again attempts something different in a genre - an epic serial killer movie - and Zodiac is the JFK of serial killer movies, an All The President's Men of detective movies. The principal cast deliver believable performances, never putting a foot wrong in their understated roles, but this is really Gyllenhaal's movie.</p></body></html>

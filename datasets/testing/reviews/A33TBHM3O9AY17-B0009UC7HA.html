<meta name="summary" content="I liked this alot more than I thought I would."></head><body><p>I watched this over the weekend on my wife's recommendation -- something that I usually avoid because she has an unnerving penchant for chick-flicks.  Strangely enough, this one was pure adventure and action from beginning to end (which is more my taste in movies) and we both enjoyed it.<br /><br />I've only seen a handful of Matthew McConaughy movies over the years, but this may well be my favorite -- just because the Dirk Pitt character is just so darned cool.  He's a true man's man -- ex Navy Seal, treasure hunter, and semi-credible action hero, complete with dashing good looks, a keen wit and a full head of wavy dark hair that is the envy of bald guys like me.  In short, he's the consummate studly guy.<br /><br />Pitt is cool, but he has some good support from guys like Al Giordino (Steve Zahn), Admiral Sandecker (well acted by William H. Macy), and the predictably babish Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz).  The story is fast-moving, the stakes high (saving the world, as is usual in movies like this), and the plot is only modestly cliche.  In short, as long as you don't intend to take this too seriously or seek a profound commentary on the meaning of life, the universe and everything, you're liable to have a lot of good clean fun with this movie.  Enjoy it.  I did.</p></body></html>

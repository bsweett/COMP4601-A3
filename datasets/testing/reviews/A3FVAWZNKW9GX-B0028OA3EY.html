<meta name="summary" content="Supe's On: Superman is Very Good, Not Great"></head><body><p>Everyone and the guy next to them at the bar has an opinion about this one. I liked it, hope you see it, and let it be what is. It is not everything I want in a Superman movie, but it was plenty of fun to see.<br /><br />"Superman Returns" has been packed with pre-release hype. How can a Superman movie ever meet its hype? The hype for each movie has been building ever since Kal El first walked the Smallville cornfields in a comic book.<br /><br />The trouble with older viewers, like myself (near 40) is we grew up on the Christopher Reeve/Gene Hackman version, and watched reruns of George Reeves' TV version. Add that to years of comic book reading, cartoons and wondering what it would be like to fly, and our expectations are tough to meet.<br /><br />The Plot, in Short:<br />Superman comes back to Earth after five years of soul-searching, looking for the remains of Krypton. Lois is living with a guy, Perry's nephew, and has a young son. Lex is released from prison, and is out to get his life back as top bad guy with a plan to build a new continent. Clark Kent returns to his job at the Daily Planet.<br /><br />Lex's experiments cause a huge blackout, endangering, among other things, Lois who is on a plane that will launch a space shuttle. Superman saves the day, and the world applauds his glorious return.<br /><br />Lex coordinates a heist of Kryptonite, steals some crystals from the Fortress of Solitude and begins on his new continent campaign.<br /><br />Can Superman stop the destruction of most of the modern world? Can he save the lives of billions of people? Will Lois survive Lex's efforts to kill her? Will Lex succeed in killing Superman with Kryptonite?<br /><br />"Superman Returns" has the makings of beginning a great new franchise, but not because it is a great movie. It is good. Very good. Fun, active, occasionally funny, and usually interesting. It follows the strong themes: Patriotism, good is good, bad is bad, and crime is a world problem that needs a hero. It is replete with Christian and mythical symbols, from Jesus Christ, to Atlas, to Loki. It is filled with heroics we expect from the man dressed in red, white and blue tights.<br /><br />However, it comes off as a different vision than what I hoped. Superman isn't as masculine, Clark isn't as awkward, Lex isn't as "love to hate." It seems as if the softer characters are segued from the TV series "Smallville," and not the traditional Superman I remember.<br /><br />Lex is still the bad guy. He still wants to rule the world. He still has a devious plan to pull it off, and is still surrounded by less than bright lackeys. Kevin Spacey's Lex isn't bad enough to convince me he is so terrible. I like him too much.<br /><br />Lois is still love-torn about Superman, and still disregards affection for Clark, but Kate Bosworth does not seem enough like a journalist who could win a Pulitzer Prize for "Why the World No Longer Needs Superman." She lacks that spark of brilliant hard-work.<br /><br />Perry Mason isn't edgy enough. J. Jonah Jameson of Peter Parker's Daily Bugle comes off far better as that guy in charge persona. Mason is too easily pushed-off.<br /><br />A few twists are worked in that reduced my view of the perfectly wholesome Superman. I need to leave off why, but as the writers and directors of the movie built in Christian imagery (Superman is a world savior, he lives his life as a sacrifice for the world there's a second coming, some Trinitarian concepts, I could on), they hurt the image. Maybe this is an attempt to create a more human character. Spiderman's movies have done amazingly well humanizing his persona.<br /><br />I have no doubt we will see more of this Superman. Whether Lex returns in the next movie I suppose depends on finding a believable bad guy. Lex is a good model to start from, but our man in tights has a long history to draw from. There is more story in the canon, and I hope to be there in the seats.<br /><br />I fully recommend "Superman Returns."<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com</p></body></html>

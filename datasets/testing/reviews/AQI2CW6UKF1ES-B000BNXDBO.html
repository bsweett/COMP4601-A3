<meta name="summary" content="I want the perfect food"></head><body><p>Everyone knows when you want something you seriously desire there's gonna be a price to pay.  And just to get to a place called White Castle, they would pay a price worth well more than the burgers.<br /><br />Two stoner friends Harold and Kumar(John Cho, and Kal Penn) who are ironicly smart, at first had problems getting blazed but came up with a way to get stoned.  But they wanted the "perfect food"  After watching a white castle advertisment, they decided that was the way.  But on this night, they find out White castle was moved out of it's regular location as told by a Burger Shack emplyee(Anthony Anderson).  But that's not the only roadblock, as Kumar's need for weed, and Harold's fear for a beautiful girl, Maria(Paula Garc&eacute;s) would cause a bit of jagged edges on their journey.  The question is, will they get what they want, or will fate screw them over?<br /><br />The comedy in this film is just flat out genious.  The director(Danny Leiner, and it's hard to believe this is the same director of dude where's my car) does a excellent job of turning usally tragic roadblocks too sheer comedy genious.  Alot of things from a game of battle$#!^$, to riding Cheetas, this is one hysterical movie.  The only things I disliked was looking at Freakshow.  It was funny, but the boils almost made me loose my lunch.  And the extreeme punks werent all that funny, unless they were the ones getting picked on.  The extras are alos excellent, and a bit hysterical as well.<br /><br />Harold and Kumar go to white castle is definitly a hilarious movie about how a normally planed night can get shot up like a target.  Anyone who loves comedy, should definitly check this out.  It is definitly alot of laughs, y-know not for the whole family(If there are young siblings) but lots of laughs.<br /><br />Peace</p></body></html>

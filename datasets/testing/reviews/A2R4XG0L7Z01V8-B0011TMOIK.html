<meta name="summary" content="They're growing up"></head><body><p>While I'm (im)patiently waiting for Goblet Of Fire to come out in November, I'm having fun watching the movies. I got the fright of my life when I started watching & Daniel & Rupert's voices had broken! They sound so strange! It's like when I left school, I remember a lot of the guys still hadn't hit puberty. But now they sound so deep & grown up! But I still remember some guys' voices breaking at school, so I asked my boyfriend the other night. They also seem to have shot up a couple of inches, and poor Emma, is still toddling along after them!<br /><br />Chamber Of Secrets really was an excellent movie, on a par with the first, even though I hated the first book, and loved the rest after that. But I have to say I hated a couple of the characters in this, particularly Professor Lockhart played by Kenneth Branagh (not Richard, why did I say Richard?) and Dobby. They were pointless characters in the books, and pointless characters in the film. Dobby annoyed the hell out of me, what was the point? One of the worst characters that JK has written so far.<br /><br />We get to see a lot more of Draco Malfoy & his dad in this too - how freaky is that white-blonde hair with the dark eyebrows? Both are getting meaner, and I swear it's only going to get worse as the movies/books go on. There's potential for the dad to get a lot worse.<br /><br />How sweet are all the Weasleys? With Julie Walters playing the mum & the stuttering guy from Shakespeare In Love playing the dad, and lookalike Rons, it's a terrific family! Thankfully we get to see a lot more of Dad Weasley in the later books, so hopefully he'll appear more in the films.<br /><br />There's a little bit of the love story between Ron & Hermione incorporated into this film, even though JK has admitted in the extras to not featuring it until the fourth book. It's a shame Hermione disappears for most of the film, from about halfway through; she's not there anymore. Aw, what a shame. You know, the thing about Hermione, is she's nothing like how she's described in the books. Her hair is so calm, and not bushy as described.<br /><br />And how weird was the flying Ford Anglia scene? There was something not quite right about that scene.<br /><br />Other reviewers have complained about the lack of screen time some of the teachers get. I had a small moan about the lack of screen time given to classes in my last review, and it's the same again. But what you have to remember, is that this film is what, over 2 hours long? Things have to be cut, and judging by the amount of deleted scenes also, it seems Chris Colombus found it quite difficult to cut scenes.<br /><br />The extras on this were slightly better than the previous one; we actually get interviews with the entire cast, rather than the crew like in the previous one. Unfortunately, nearly all of them are interviewed on the set (I always find it more interesting to see them interviewed out of character), only Alan Rickman isn't filmed on set. (He's definitely got a lot of makeup on, either that or it's the hair!) I still haven't managed to get through half the games, but at least they're less annoying than the previous game.<br /><br />This has to be a film to be seen, but not if you're scared of spiders. Who else had flashbacks to Eight Legged Freaks or the Arachnophobia film? (I haven't seen the latter, and don't plan to either - the former was bad enough.) Hopefully in the later films, the director will choose to cut Dobby. Seriously, NOT a good character.</p></body></html>

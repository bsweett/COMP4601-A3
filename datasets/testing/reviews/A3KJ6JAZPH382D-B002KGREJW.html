<meta name="summary" content="Little Miss Overrated"></head><body><p>Having finally rented this DVD after all the praise and an Oscar, I was expecting a good dose of hilarity. What I got was a dark rewrite of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009NHC9">National Lampoon's Vacation</a> brought up to these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNBQ">Napoleon Dynamite</a> times. It's dark, cynical and relentlessly bleak, even if moments of really funny stuff bounce off the bleakness.<br /><br />The actors are all well suited for their roles, with Abigail Breslen perfect as Olive and Alan Arkin getting the snarkiest lines as the heroin snorting granddad. Steve Carell proved he had dramatic chops here, even he is forced to play the gay clich&eacute; to the max, and Paul Dano gets a heck of a lot of mileage out of not speaking for most of the film.<br /><br />However, the film never really nails its timing. Funny bits are spaced with long pits of dysfunction, forcing you to deal with the fact that these people are genuinely annoying. The finale is a hoot, but again, every person here loses their dream. The payoff a broad comedy aims at the arthouse crowd...or maybe fans of Carell. Put aside the hype, and you have a stunningly average bit of filmmaking.</p></body></html>

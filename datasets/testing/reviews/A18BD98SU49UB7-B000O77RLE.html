It is not Eastwoods best or worst. So what if this film "shows soldiers unfairly killing captives". Come on folks...<br /><br />People are strange.<br /><br />Letters from Iwo Jima, and this is the first time I say this Cliche in 9 years of reviewing: is unflinching. There are times when you wish the camera would leave a little more to the imagination, sure, but war is brutal. This film is brutal. But, it is nice to see a film that has not become "pearlharborized" and suggestive.<br /><br />The center of the plot in one sentence: The Japanese side of Iwo Jima. I'll tell you what though, there is a lot to it. I left both this film and Flags with a greater appreciation of the men on both sides. Also, a greater understanding of the rediculousness of it all. I mean, as far as some of the ideology of the soldiers. Stepping on toes is a thing of mine. Ofcourse, theologically, we have the benefit of hindsight. Blah.<br /><br />Are there problems with the movie? Yeah. Are there problems with Citizen Kane and Fargo? Yeah. (grrr...afi) Some of the problems, as aforementioned by some, was the lack of display of the 20,000 Japanese. Ofcourse if history tells us that the soldiers were always scattered across the island, in caves etc..., one sweeping shot of massive bunched hordes would be an unfaithful recount.<br /><br />Side Note: The Acting is Brilliant.<br /><br />I don't know. There are many people willing to repeat over and over all those little details that apparently MANY feel obligated to restate, but not I. I loved the movie, but this is a rant, and it's done. ~Sir Adam of Scots~</p></body></html>

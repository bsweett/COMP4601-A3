<meta name="summary" content="Still Good the Third Time Around!"></head><body><p>Though not quite as good as the first two, this is still one of the best animated films to come out in the last couple of years!  There are some hilarious scenes, especially when Shrek has a nightmare of being a father to thousands of little Shreks!  The dying scene of the king was copied from many prior comedies, but it is still funny nonetheless.<br /><br />The newly added characters such as Captain Hook bring a nice touch.  I hope there will be enough of a demand for more of these films!</p></body></html>

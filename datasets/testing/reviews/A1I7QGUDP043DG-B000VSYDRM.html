<meta name="summary" content="Perfume Review"></head><body><p>This movie is a horror with a fairytale quality due to the random narration, and though there is very little humor in this dark tale, it does have some surface beauty that propels it far above your ordinary horror story.  I love the unique twist on a serial killer obsessed with capturing the 'scent of a woman'.  His first kill is accidental, but once he advances his craft of separating a flower/woman's smell and putting it in a vial, he can't seem to stop until he's captured the scent of every beautiful woman he's ever smelled.  The ending is surreal, and a wicked surprise.  Bravo!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

His singing here is top notch, and his dancing is eye opening. But the movie is a structural mess, replete with three full blown fantasy dance sequences that are interruptive and an intrusive boy who is supposed to be Darin as a kid, now looking on as Darin tells the story of his ill-fated life, cut short by a bad heart. The device doesn't work well. Neither do Spacey's voice-overs. You never get the sense of Darin as such a great performer either, though the movie tries to convince you that he was. He's all but forgotten now, and his music, much of it, hasn't aged well. The love interest with Sandra Dee lacks heat. And Spacey is just too old and jowly to play Darin anyway. Give him an A for effort. It just doesn't work.</p></body></html>

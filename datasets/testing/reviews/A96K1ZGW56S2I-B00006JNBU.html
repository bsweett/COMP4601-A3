<meta name="summary" content="When Will It End?"></head><body><p>One would think by reading the majority of the critical reviews, CHARLIE'S ANGELS is a great movie adaptation of the 1970s television show. Well, don't think that. CHARLIE'S ANGELS is NOT a great adaptation of the television show in which it was based. Yes, the movie has lots of jiggle and action and the plot is believable (though it's a rip off of MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE). However, the movie is totally uninspired.<p>Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore are the only people in the film who actually look like they enjoyed making the movie. Everyone else in the movie has this look of "what have I gotten myself into" on their faces, especially Lucy Liu and Bill Murray. Actually, Murray and Liu spend most of the movie scowling (suggesting that the rumors of bad blood between those two were true). I'm not surprised Murray does not wish to return as Bosley in the sequel.<p>As mentioned before, the film contains a great deal of action. Too much action to be precise. Kung Wu action sequences and bullet time work well in films like THE MATRIX where those movements are essential to the plot; CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON which is basically a mystical modern legend; and in SHREK because it's a cartoon. However, as cool as those action sequences are, they don't work in every action movie. Those sequences have been exploited and are being overused, often taking any sense of empathy away from otherwise good movies. Those Kung Wu moves were used so much in CHARLIE'S ANGELS that I started laughing every time the Angels were fighting.<p>I was young enough to watch the last few seasons of "Charlie's Angels" when it aired on television. Granted, the show didn't have the best writing in the world and is best known for its jiggle factor. However, the show never really was campy. CHARLIE'S ANGELS the movie is total camp, making fun of itself throughout the picture. That's so sad because the film could have been so good. Moral of the story: don't let McG direct anymore movies.</p></body></html>

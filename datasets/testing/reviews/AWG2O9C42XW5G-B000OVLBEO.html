<meta name="summary" content="Ghost Rider Kick's Butt"></head><body><p>This movie is awesome. i have to agree with some of the other reviwers. you comic book geeks judge these movies so hard. they won't always be true to the books. hey, at least they did it right on how Johnny Blaze became GhostRider, unlike The Hulk, if you know what i mean. the hulk would've been better if they did it the right way on how bruce became the hulk. but the point is just don't be so quick to judge at least they came close. If they keep on making superhero movies i'll go see them. Nichlos cage was awesome in this movie, this was the best one he did since Face/Off. The special effcts were awesome. i loved the way they did his transformation. This film is not good for kids under the age of 12. and i thought the actor who played Blackheart was cool, to bad they didn't make him the big purple monster we all love to hate. he looked the part. i also thought that peter fonda was excellent has mephisto. i beat the soundtrack, video game and book will be good. thats about it<br /><br />peace out<br /><br />if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do</p></body></html>

He's delayed opening his own business with the excuse that he needs more time to conceptualize it until it's "perfect."  And he's lonely too, and hasn't had a date in quite a while because he lives in his mind.  Under the most horrifying of circumstances, Foxx's character, Max Durocher, has his whole world collapse around him, and he finds out to his surprise, that it isn't 100% negative thing.  I kept thinking maybe the writers called him "Durocher" to remind us of the old time ballplayer Leo Durocher and his famous saying that "Nice guys finish last."<br /><br />Cruise is very good, although he isn't asked to give the acting workout that Jamie Foxx undergoes.  And Jada Pinkett Smith, short as she is, makes interesting acting choices in what could have been a nothing role as the US attorney, Annie, who becomes Max's love interest.  And there are other great actors let loose in this wildly entertaining film, everyone from Irma Hall to Javier Bardem to Mark Ruffalo, who seems to make every other film that's released nowadays but who won't find another one soon with as much topnotch quality and mass appeal.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Awesome Sci-fi comedy adventure!"></head><body><p>Set in the distant future, a cab driver named Korben Dallas ( Bruce Willis) has a tough life until one day he meets a unusual fare that fell into his cab. It's a lovely alien beauty named "Leeloo" ( Milla Jovovich) whom was really a secret experiement as she is known as the ultimate weapon against evil, she with Korben Dallas must save the world from a destructive force as there must be five important elements to destroy it, along his way he meets a cast of colorful characters such as Ruby Rod ( Chris Tucker), Cornelius ( Ian Holm) and the dastardly Zorg ( Gary Oldman).<br /><br />From Luc Besson ( director of "Leon The Professional" and " Le Femme Nikita) comes a totally dazzling, colorful and wonderful Sci-fi fantasy comedy adventure epic which is now a cult favorite among Sci-fi fans. Luc Besson has always dreamed of doing this movie since he was a teen, it finally came true as this movie is a stunning flick with great performances, a witty sense of humor, non-stop action, impressive visual effects, cool aliens, and this movie is totally one of my all time favorite movies.<br /><br />The new 2-Disc Ultimate Edition is a big time improvement over the previous bareboned DVDs in both regular and Superbit forms, but this one has nice extras. It's got a handful of featurettes such as how they designed the movie, a scene that never made it into the final cut, optional full length trivia track, and it has Superbit digital picture with perfect sound quality.<br /><br />This is a must see and must have for Sci-fi DVD collectors everywhere! it's a good time of a movie and one of my choices for best movies of 1997.<br /><br />Also recommended: " Total Recall", " The Running Man", "Blade Runner", "Dark City", " The Dark Crystal", "The Wizard of Oz", " Akira", "Ghost in The Shell", " Metropolis ( 2001 and 1927 versions)", " Armageddon", "Con Air", " Stargate", "Independence Day", "Titanic", " Starship Troopers", " The Terminator 1 & 2", " 6th Day", " Heavy Metal", " Big Trouble in Little China", " Sky Captain and the World of Tommorow", "Star Wars Trilogy", " Star Trek movies", " Ghost in The Shell 2: Innocence", " Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai", " Barberella", " Flash Gordon", " Dune" ( both versions), " Indiana Jones Trilogy", " The Mummy ( 1999)", " Transformers: The Movie".</p></body></html>

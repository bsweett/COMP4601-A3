<meta name="summary" content="Yes! Finally! DVD!"></head><body><p>I am so excited they are releasing all three of these movies in a box set.  I have been waiting forever for this to come out on DVD.  Back To The Future was the biggest movies in 1985 grossing 210 Million dollars.  The sequel I thought was just as good if not even a little better released in 1989 but it was unfortunate that it didn't do as well as the first.  The third on released in 1990 went back to the west, I thought this was the weakest of the three but finished up the series on a well note.  I can't wait for the DVD Boxed Set!</p></body></html>

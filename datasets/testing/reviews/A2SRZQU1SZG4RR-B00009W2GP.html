Along with "Star Wars" and the "Jurassic Park" films, it will go down in film-making history for its originality and unique, special effects. Part III pulls together the mystery, intrigue, romance, and tensions developed in the first two films. The mysticism and religious allusions are effectively balanced with the "war" that is inevitable ...<p>It begins with both Neo and the other guy lying on two stretchers - out cold, trapped in the cyberspace of "the Matrix". Trinity, Morpheus and the others are trying to revive them, to return them intact to Zion. The next scene is Neo at a train station ... talking to an Indian couple and a little girl of about 4 years old. They are waiting for the 'trainmaster' who will help them return to the 'real world', for them it is the one created by machines. Neo learns, the little girl, is Seti, their daughter, whom they love ... but she is a program, who can be deleted. Neo discovers how "love" transcends *even* the programming of machines. Neo finds out the trainman works for the Frenchman, the Frenchman controls their fate ... the trains is due, but it is late ... How does Neo escape this trap, of being caught in a purgatorial existence, not really belonging to either the world of Zion or the one created by the machines? The scenes are phenomenal. Naturally, he makes it out, with the help of his friends ...<p>Zion plans for the inevitable invasion by the machines. The humans prepare a few surprises of their own ... indescribable combat scenes, indescribable special effects. I sat with clenched teeth and tense muscles, as swarms of insect-like and squid-like machines zoomed and descended into Zion. The fighting scenes are some of the best I have ever viewed ... When the Oracle is consulted we learn the simple but hard truth, that she does not predict anything, she provides information and those who summon her help "make a choice" based on their "belief" in themselves. Neo and Trinity leave in a ship -- with a stow-away on board ... Neo "believes" in his abilities after a tragic occurrence. Neo does what must be done ... you have to see the film to know what that is and how the film ends. This film is *highly* recommended. Of the three films, this is my favorite. One must view all three to fully appreciate and understand why the Matrix series is so popular and appealing. Erika Borsos (erikab93)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The debates will never end."></head><body><p>I can say that, as far as reviews go, this is one of the most debated films ever.  I'm gonna say it right now, both sides are right.<p>One one hand, this film is important, and it can be studied.  It is a psychological  film, that not everyone will understand, probably because it's very hard to  understand.  The film has some haunting images, and it's by Stanley  Kubrick...<p>But this is not one of his better films.  Even if Film Scolars  look deep into this work, and understand it, the message is simple.  The  plot is simple, and even though it may seem deep, it's shallow on the  surface.  The film is slow in order to let the plot sit in, which most  people won't like, although it worked for 2001.<p>I know my review may be  confusing, but I'm so confused about this movie that I don't know what to  think.  I can say this, if you haven't seen it, give it a rent first,  because this is a movie not everyone will like.</p></body></html>

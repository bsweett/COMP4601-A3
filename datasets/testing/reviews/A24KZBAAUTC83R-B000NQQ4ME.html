The tale of the tail tells all.<br /><br />Hoo-hum Box Office sales, but the lead in DVD sales. That's with no doubt due to his ranting and subsequent arrest. But overlying all of this is the absolute high quality of storytelling and savage beauty he can lend to a film. This is without a doubt one of the best films ever made.<br /><br />Filled with such raw beauty and savage violence, Gibson is smart enough to balance it with showing the love and caring his characters evoke. Not just rely on great action seqeunces, or special effects. The downfall of many a director.<br /><br />This movie shines beautifully on my 65-inch HD T.V. Better than the theater. If you don't own a huge HD TV, then you must purchase one to get the full effect of such awesome filmed movies.<br /><br />A must have for your library.</p></body></html>

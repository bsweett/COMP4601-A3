<meta name="summary" content="I have never laughed so hard in my life!!"></head><body><p>This movie will go down as one of my favorite movies of all time. Anybody who knows me can honestly say that I don't smile easily. I think it's because I have little or no sense of humor, and things that most people find funny, I don't find amusing at all. When I saw this movie, I was pleasantly surprised because I was on the floor laughing. I think this movie is so visually beautiful at times I couldn't help but smile. There are few cartoons that I like, watch, or even give the time of day, but I just felt drawn to this movie. I'm glad to say it wasn't a total waste of time. I think people of all ages will love this despite the fact that it is a child's movie because the music is awesome and done with taste instead of being raunchy and disrespectful. I have watched this movie so many times that I love to sing-a-long. I recommend buying this movie definitely. I think the kids will really enjoy this one.</p></body></html>

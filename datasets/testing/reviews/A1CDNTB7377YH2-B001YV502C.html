<meta name="summary" content="Great if Played in a Home Theater"></head><body><p>I put this DVD in my home theater with surround-sound and must admit that the last 20 minutes of this movie, I literally felt transported into the screen.  The effects are that good as well as frightening.  The scene called "ceasefire" was gut-wrenchingly poignant.  Now to the movie.  It was pretty good though not as great as the critics seemed to say.  The plot was a little difficult to understand.  It appears that Britain in this wacky future world is the only "intact" country remaining after world-wide anarchy has taken place over mankind's inability to reproduce.  Even Britain itself is a hornets nest of pitched battles itself with more chaos than what is going on in Iraq.  The government seems to have been cracking down on "illegal" aliens; hunting them down.<br /><br />Julanne Moore is the rebel leader and she is gunned down rather early in the movie.  The other rebels are harboring an alien who is pregnant.  Clive Owen's character overhears the rebels plotting to kill him and the woman after she gives birth.  This causes him to flee with the pregnant woman and go into hiding.<br /><br />I should mention that Owen gives another great performance as well as Michael Caine, who is an aged Woodstock-type hippie.<br /><br />The ending leaves the viewer with some hope that better things should come, and leaves the movie open for a possible sequel.</p></body></html>

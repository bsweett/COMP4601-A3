Robert Wise returns to his often muddled, too long and struggling mess of a film that relaunched the STAR TREK franchise onto the big screen - and is allowed to make the changes he wanted, add the effects that were never completed in time and remaster the score to pitch perfect quality - and even after his final seal of approval, it's still a work in progress... and it is still a wonder to behold.  It also is one of the &quot;must buy, must own&quot; DVD's for this holiday season - for both fans of the series and those new to the franchise.  The script is intelligent, the performances (a bit uneasy at the start, but well seated by the close of the film) are top notch and the added effects and the new edits to the film both tighten and expand its appeal.  Much of what was left unfisnished has been completed and added neatly into the story - we now get to see the V'GER ship as it orbits the Earth.  We get more detail and background of the cloud, we have added scenes (a whole new V'GER chamber, a CG Enterprise, a brand new Vulcan without moons, and what is perhaps the first CG Star Trek cast to make it to the screen), and we have scenes cut shorter to make for better pacing.  The audio commentary is informative and entertaining, while the text based commentary is almost overloaded - appearing and disappearing so fast that you dare not blink for fear you might miss something.  The new transfer is clean and very pretty and the second disc is packed with features, deleted scenes, advertising (how many of you remember that Orson Wells provided the narration for the previews?) and docmentaries (of which only one was too short for my taste, the PHASE II era of STAR TREK is glossed over all too quickly - but does feature for the first time the original test footage of the new Enterprise and uniforms - pick up the book: STAR TREK: PHASE II for expanded information plus the original IN THY IMAGE script), plus an inventive menu design featuring V'GER.  PARAMOUNT has finally done right by STAR TREK, and STAR TREK fans and THE MOTION PICTURE is not to be missed.</p></body></html>

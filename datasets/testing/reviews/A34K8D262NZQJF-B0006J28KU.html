<meta name="summary" content="Pacino and DeNiro together holding hands into the sunset!"></head><body><p>After all these years and 2 hours after the movie it happens.... Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino talk face to face in a diner. I know it sounds stupid but for the past twenty years writers have thought of every stupid excuse to put these two heavyweights in a movie together but it never happened. Finally Heat has the two starring in the same film but both actor's are on different sides making this a true classic Crime Story. It's almost like one of those classic detective films but for this era instead with a sleek style and shiny criminals joining dirty ones to make big heists. Val Kilmer is in it and he's alright ... Anyways, the fact that this is the only movie that stars DeNiro and Pacino since the Godfather 2 and the fact that this time they are both in the same time frame so when the two talk to eachother it's something you have to see for yourself. You can tell the scenes where done almost surgically when the two appear on the same screen. Anyways this movie is good and it's an essential to any Action movie collector!</p></body></html>

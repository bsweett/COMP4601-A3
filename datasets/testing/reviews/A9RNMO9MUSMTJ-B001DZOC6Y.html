<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyed this movie very much........but"></head><body><p>No, there is no monsters ripping heads off, there is no massive amounts of<br /> gore and blood, there are no vampires, ghosts, creepy crawlies,,, but....<br />there is something happening out there..<br />  This is what i got from this movie, the music, the feelings, the sense<br />of despair when nothing makes sense anymore.<br />  I was pleasently entertained by this scenario and enjoyed the movie<br />from beginning to the end.<br />Good for a Keeper, good for multiple views.</p></body></html>

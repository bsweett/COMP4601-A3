They give it every Award they can but in the end you are stuck with a box office failure that made less than $15 million in North America.  By winning the Oscar it beat out CRASH as the least commercial film to win best picture.  But that is the modern nature of the Oscars -- to celebrate movies that no one wanted to see and didn't. The errors in this movie have already been documented.  To honest Kathryn Bigelow did her best film over 20 years ago with NEAR DARK.</p></body></html>

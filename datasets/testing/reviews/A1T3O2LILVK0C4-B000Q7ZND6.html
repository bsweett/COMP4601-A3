<meta name="summary" content="John Constantine: Hellblazer"></head><body><p>Loosely based upon the dark comic book and graphic novel series published by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0756641195">DC Comics</a>/<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0756641225">Vertigo</a>, Constantine is a supernatural thriller with amazing visual effects, thrilling action, and a great cast. Unfortunately, the film's screenplay, which was written by Kevin Brodbin and Frank Cappello, fails to capture the spirit of the books. Rather than keeping the characters as they are in the books, the writers have taken liberties that minimalize the effect of the story. In the books, John Constantine is a blond-haired British anti-hero. Here he's played by Keanu Reeves, with black hair and an American accent. Normally I wouldn't complain about such trivial details, but the character of Constantine is further changed from his comic book counterpart. This brings me to one of the film's greatest strengths; it's original and unafraid to make changes. Breaking away from many of the conventions found in the "superhero" genre, Constantine dares to be somber and politically incorrect. Can you name any other "comic book" film where the hero has cancer, is suicidal, and generally disliked by everyone that he associates with? Nope, I didn't think so.<br /><br />Demon hunter and exorcist, John Constantine has never been a popular guy, but his talents are in high demand. Constantine has the ability to see damned spirits and the knowledge necessary to send them back to Hell. The only problem is that he's a chain-smoking, cynical, selfish S.O.B. and he's just been diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. When Constantine is contacted by detective Angela Dodson to investigate the apparent suicide of her twin sister, Constantine discovers a demonic conspiracy to bring about the apocalypse. Relying on a small group of demon hunters, occultists, and half-breeds (a term for Earth-bound angels and demons), Constantine wages a war against the Devil. But it's only a matter of time before his cancer overpowers him and the sins of his past decide his fate in the afterlife. Will John Constantine be sent to Hell for his misdeeds, or will the gates of Heaven part for this proud and defiant sinner? In the battle between two worlds, between Heaven and Hell, between all that's good and all that's evil, between the holy and the profane... John Constantine fights for the middle ground.<br /><br />The big budget action/thriller features an atypical cast, which with the exception of odd man out Keanu Reeves, fits the film's anarchic atmosphere perfectly. Though Keanu gives a fine performance, his looks and his mannerisms never seem right for the character, who was supposedly modeled after Clint Eastwood as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015XHQTE">Dirty Harry</a> and Sting, the lead singer of the Police. The cast includes Rachel Weisz as Angela and Isabel Dodson, Shia LaBeouf as Chas, Tilda Swinton as Gabriel, Djimon Honsou as Papa Midnite, Gavin Rossdale as Balthazar, and Peter Stormare as Satan. Each member of the diverse cast gives a worthy performance, but the standout here is indie film star Tilda Swinton, who plays the beatific and androgynous angel Gabriel with a delicious irony.<br />As has often been the case with films based upon characters created by Alan Moore, Constantine became a showcase for the latest computer effects rather than focusing on the deeply flawed characters that made the books so successful.<br />With the film's blasphemous overtones, it's no wonder that many religious groups were up in arms about the portrayal of Biblical figures. Still the film serves up about as much theological discussion as similarly ironic film RoboCop did for discussions about law enforcement, which is fine by me. Not every film needs to take itself so seriously and Constantine doesn't. Another flaw of the film is the direction, which feels both forced and mechanical in its execution. Directed by music video auteur Francis Lawrence, who focuses on creating a visually stunning but emotionally devoid alternate reality populated by all manner of miscreants and lost souls. If you're looking for a thought provoking film about redemption through spirituality, then Constantine will likely disappoint. But if what you seek is a fast-paced thriller with lots of action and witty dialogue, then Constantine is for you.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1563896974">Swamp Thing: The Curse</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1563890526">Hellblazer: Original Sins</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1563891506">John Constantine, Hellblazer: Dangerous Habits</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416503439">War Lord John Constantine</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEWEGC">The Exorcist - The Complete Anthology</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ATQYWY">Kolchak: The Night Stalker</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NQRR1Q">The Ninth Gate</a></p></body></html>

No films of substance were released during the summer because no one went to the films during the summer because they were on vacation.  That is until Jaws came through and broke Sound of Music boxoffice record.<br /><br />That is the importance of Jaws, not that it is a great film. Everyone knows the story.  Big shark terrorizes little beach resort but the big wigs don't want to cancel the big holiday event.<br /><br />Spielberg is a technical director.  He is best at scenes that do not involve words and emotion.  He is best at minipulating the audience through camera angles, editing and music.  But when it comes to the acting, these scenes are only as good as the actors in it.  And in this we have the great Robert Shaw who steals the movie as the rustic shark hunter.  The rest of the actors flounder in the mediocrity of the script.<br /><br />You might ask why am I writing this review, it was on my recomended by Amazon list and I am just warning people like me that it would be better to invest in Alfred Hitchcock films than this.<br /><br />With that said, this is a film to watch when you want something mindless.  This is not a film classic but a fun classic.</p></body></html>

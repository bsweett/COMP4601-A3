Directed by Joe Johnston he directed Honey I Shrunk The Kids, The Rocketeer, Jumanji & Juraassic Park III. Stars Chris Evans as Steve Rodgers, Captain America, Hugo Weaving as The Red Skull, Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Chester Phillips, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter & a small appearance by Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury. Story is Steve Rodgers wants to join The Army during World War II but a commanding officer Colonel Chester Phillips gives him a hard time cause he thinks he's too small a docter named Abraham Erskine has created a super soldier serium. Steve Rodgers agrees to it so he can serve his country. An assassin kills Dr Erskine Peggy Carter tries to stop him but he flees outside Steve Rodgers chases him down pretty good scene he throws a kid in an ocean the boy tells Steve Rodgers it's ok I can swim. It has it's fun moments. The assassin commits suicide with a cyanide capsule before he can be questioned. Rodgers is given The Captain America costume & is sent to promote war bonds on some kind of U  S  O  tour he learns about has been captured fighting in the war. Colonel Phillips won't let him go but he disobey's Peggy Carter Howard Stark ( Tony Stark's father) sneak him in cool action scene where he rescues the soldiers. Your introduced to The Red Skull they have a fight better than any of the fights between Red Skull & Cap in the 1990 movie. Check out my review for Captain America 1990. Red Skull escapes Rodgers is feared M  I  A or  K  I  A but he returns & asks what his punishment is Colonel Phillips says nothing. There's another good action scene where Cap & the troops are owning N  a  z  i's. Well done scene on the train a buddy of Cap's falls to his death. Cap finds out about the base of operations of the Red Skull. You have a really good chase with Captain America on a motorcycle being chased by The Red Skull's goons. Cap is captured but US Forces bust in it's a pretty good finale. Captain America stops The Red Skull from destroying New York City. They have a pretty good fight scene. Cap can't land the plane or cause the weapons will go off he has a final conversation with Peggy Carter who has became a love intrest. he crashes in the Antartica. Steve Rodgers wakes up 70 years later in a 40's style hospital room in NYC. He feels something is wrong he flees outside Nick Fury which leads into The Avengers next year. I know I didn't explain the plot very good but I enjoyed Captain America it was slow & talky but it had enough action a lead that could carry a movie that it's a pretty solid movie Joe Johnston did a decent job directing. I didn't know a whole lot about Chris Evans but he did a good job. Hugo Weaving wasn't too bad he was a better Red Skull than Scott Paulin Weaving at least stayed in The Red Skull make up. Tommy Lee Jones wasn't given much to do but he did a good job. Hayley Atwell was pretty good. I like this movie wholehearted more than X Men First Class. I'll continue with my LW reviews soon.</p></body></html>

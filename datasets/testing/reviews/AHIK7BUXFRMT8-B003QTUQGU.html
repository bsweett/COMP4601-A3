The execution of the component parts of the film are all first class and very competent; it's just the overall result is rather grim and excessive.<br /><br />Johnny Depp does his usual remarkable job of being strange; his versatility continues to amaze me as he shifts roles and appearances like a real pro from film to film. The sound and video quality on the Blu-ray version left nothing to be desired.<br /><br />As one reviewer pointed out this is Alice's second trip to Wonderland; the first one was initially forgotten by Alice but comes back to her toward the end of the movie where she begins to remember bits and pieces of her first trip.<br /><br />I watched this movie as a rental and I'm glad I did; I will probably never seek it out to watch it again. Although it's rated PG I would caution parents of small children about the threatening and rather dark ambience of the film.<br /><br />Your enjoyment of this movie may likely depend on the extent of your enthusiasm for Tim Burton's style of directing; if you are a fan you will probably love this movie. If you're not sure whether you're a fan or not, rent it first.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Gyllenhaal is a very good actor, and was very good-believable,BUT"></head><body><p>that's all folks. If it was not for his performance, this movie would be, in my opinion, a complete loser. I bought this movie because the initial reviews were pretty good and I like him. I still like him. I generously gave this movie three stars solely because of Gyllenhaal's ability. This one won't get passed around.</p></body></html>

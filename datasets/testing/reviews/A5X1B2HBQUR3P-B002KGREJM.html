<meta name="summary" content="This one is all about Forest Whitaker's performance."></head><body><p>Although it is based on the true backdrop of the rule of idi Amin, this is actually a fictional account. The main protogonist who plays the doctor is fictional and so should be his portrayed affair with one of Idi Amin's wives. The performance by Forest Whitaker takes the cake. He makes Idi Amin's terror convingly real. THis movie should be just seen for the performance of Forest. The climax is also just a fictional dramatization. It's for giving a good ending to an expansive film. Great cinematography and uganda locales. But just see this for Forest whitaker's performance. It's that good.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></body></html>

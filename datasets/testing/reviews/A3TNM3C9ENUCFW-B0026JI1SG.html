<meta name="summary" content="Powerful film that stays with you"></head><body><p>I'm reviewing this movie again, as I just deleted the last one which was bombarded with "unhelpful" votes. It seems that the point I was trying to make has been missed for the most part, so I'll try and reiterate.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie from the point of view of acting, direction, and script, and as I predicted it did of course win 4 oscars recently, to rubberstamp that viewpoint, most desevedly and notably for Hilary Swanks incredible performance.<br /><br />All that said however, the movie is slow to start, often plodding in dialogue and continuity in places, and regardless of how masterfully portrayed, it's a very depressing picture. As previously stated, Eastwood has of late immersed his directing (and acting talents here) into the stark realities of human nature in their most raw and naked state, arguably having a free reign like most other renowned directors, by not being entrenched in hollywood "crowd pleasers" as if caring less about the financial success or failure of the picture at the box office.<br /><br />Clint plays Frankie Dunn, a long time boxing manager and expert corner man "from the old days" as narrated by Morgan Freeman who is desperately embittered with an approaching old age laced with regret and emotional torment. His current title hope ditches him for a high flying competitor, his estranged daughter returns all of his letters unopened, his priest admonishes his cantankorous debating, and Freeman is an uneasy friend/employee and former talent who was blinded in one eye after his last fight (something which Frankie also blames himself for). Enter Hilary Swank as Maggie Fitzgerald, a 30 something down to earth woman encumbered with a past of zero opportunity, and humble but tangible dreams, despite her trailer park family ties. Her desire to follow her dreams to box, and her tenacity and stubborness eventually win over Frankie who decides to train her after initially refusing several times, and against his better judgement. What follows is a symbiotic relationship on which both characters thrive, she becoming a surrogate for his own estranged daughter, and he a surrogate for her dead father whom she admired and misses terribly.<br /><br />The movie turns from this point into a rags to riches to rags picture, with a sombre tone that whilst being absorbing actually leaves you feeling pretty miserable. I'm not criticizing the flavor of the film, but even the most ardent of human drama fans will find the lack of ANY levity to be amiss. Combining euthenasia into the story adds more fuel to the sobriety of everything, and regardless of your political or moral affiliations on the subject, most will agree that too many plot holes, and unlikely inconsistencies make the ending seem unecessarily protracted.<br /><br />I have always been a fan of Eastwood, both as an actor and director, and have seen most, if not all of his movies, and rarely have a bad word to say, because even the most sombre of topics has been balanced, lifted where necessary, or even had funny moments. "Lightening" the subject does not mean that the viewer will take the subject  lightly, and although a movie does not have to be a comedy to be entertaining, it shouldn't be morose either. Like Mystic River before this, Clint has proved he can handle some thorny issues with as much mastery as a western or any other genre, just from a strictly personal point of view however I think the lighter side of his talents would be most welcome in his next project.</p></body></html>

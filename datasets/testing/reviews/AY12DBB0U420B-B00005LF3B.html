<meta name="summary" content="An Adventure Story For All Time. Five Stars!"></head><body><p>Last night's bargain-rack movie was "Cast Away" and starred Tom Hanks. I found it on the five dollar rack at Wal-Mart and it was one of the best movies I've seen in at least the last decade. I've always liked camping. I guess it's just a little adventure in  that you're out in the open and don't really know what's going to happen. Plus, it's coping with natural conditions. Well, that's just a micro-adventure, of course. If you want to view a really stupendous adventure, give "Cast Away" a viewing.<br /><br />Tom Hanks played a globe-trotting, overly busy FedEx employee. He joined his fiance in Memphis at Christmas and promised to be back on New Year's Eve, after a quick trip to the Far East. Well, the FedEx plane went down somewhere in the Western Pacific. Hanks managed to escape and with a small inflatable raft made it to an unknown, apparently uninhabited island. His only possessions were that which he had on him and about a half-dozen FedEx packages which beached along with him plus a dead FedEx employee who was killed in the plane wreck and floated ashore. Well, it was immediately back to The Stone Age for Hanks with no food, no tools no shelter and few clothes. Of course, there were the FedEx packages, which had such useful items as a pair of figure skates, a volleyball and a big collection of VHS tapes. The skates became his only tool and the volleyball, with a face fashioned out of a blood smear, became his only companion He called the ball Wilson, after the brand name.<br /><br />The movie depicted Hanks' struggle to cope with his environment and find enough foodstuffs to survive. He ended up living on coconuts, small crustaceans and the few fish he could catch. Ultimately, he got a fire started, Boy Scout Style. This type of struggle went on for over four years and was just exceptionally well depicted. Ultimately, he built a raft out of wood scraps tied together mostly by vines and the VHS tapes. He managed to get it out beyond the surf zone with him then floating out in the open ocean where he was discovered, near death, by a freight liner almost 500 miles from his island origin, Then it was back to civilization. Everyone had given up on his survival. He had been given a funeral. They even buried a casket containing some of his belongings. His fiance was married and had about a three-year-old daughter.<br /><br />This was just a stunningly good movie. Essentially, it's a one-man show with just a bit of minor support at the beginning and end. There is no question in my mind that Hanks should have had the Best Actor Academy Award no matter what the competition was, His performance was just stunning. The direction and photography and everything about this film a\was just about perfect. Essentially, there was almost no action. It was just a one-man struggle against nature. There were no wild animals, not even birds. No disasters, other than the plane crash. No musical score to accompany the movie. None of the essentials, yet it was a stunningly good movie.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A glimpse into the soulful music of Charles and his soul"></head><body><p>No matter which name they announce on Oscar night, Jamie Foxx will still be the winner. The only true competition this year would have been Jeff Bridges' searing performance in The Door in the Floor or Paul Giamannti in Sideways and neither one of these actors was nominated. Foxx's performance towers above everyone else nominated this year. He channels Charles' energy, quirks, movements and personality in a performance that doesn't just mimic Charles but goes right to the heart of the man.<br /><br />Director Taylor Hackford's love of music infuses this film as it has just about every other one he's directed. The difference here is that Hackford truly has found a larger-than-life but very mortal artist that changed the sound of R&B by merging it seamlessly with the emotional power of gospel, country and western and just about any other genre Charles effortlessly tackled. What makes Ray so powerful is its unflincing honesty about Charles' demons and infidelities. It also shows that, regardless of Charles' sins, his salvation always could be found in the emotional core of his music.<br /><br />Ray looks very good on DVD. The length of the theatrical release along with the inclusion of deleted scenes for the longer DVD release means that the image quality has been compromised just a tad. The colors are rich with remarkable detail and the solid blacks are highlights of this transfer. 25 minutes of additional footage has been added back in for the extended version. You have the option to watch either the original version or this extended version. The image quality, color and clarity vary a bit as it cuts between the theatrical version and the deleted scenes. Clearly, this wasn't recut and retimed for this "extended" version. The difference between the finished film and the added scenes are quite noticeable and jarring. The 5.1 soundtrack features a rich full bodied sound that immediately pulls you into the action. Charles' songs (featuring both original and new recordings) sound terrific in the 5.1 format.<br /><br />The inclusion of the 25 minutes of footage is a welcome addition but there are a couple of problems. Unlike Fox's superb extended branching editions of the Alien films, the disc pauses as it searches for the deleted scenes. This disrupts the continuity and flow of the movie. Personally, I would have preferred this in a 2 disc set featuring both the theatrical cut and the extended version along with extras on the flipside of one of these discs. There IS a two disc edition but it's bogged down by extras many of which are little more than padding. We also get to see the complete uncut performances of Ray & The Raelettes performing Hit the Road Jack and a number of other tracks cut for the film. Walking in His Shoes features Jamie Foxx discussing his performance of Charles and Charles himself performing with Foxx. Luckily Foxx was trained as a classical pianist so he aquits himself very well when they goof around ont he Charles chestnut "Mess Around". It's fun to watch and a worthwhile addition to the set. Ray Remembered features interviews with those that worked with him past and present both on his albums and those that observed him while working on the film. The differences between the single disc edition and the double disc are in the extras. The two disc edition features a number of fascinating featurettes on the women in Charles' life, the "Soulmates" featurette, a documentary on Taylor Hackford's love of Charles' music and difficulty in getting the project made and an exceptionally good documentary on Charles entitled "Ray: An American Journey". If you aren't likely to dip your toe into these feauturettes and documentaries than the extra cost for the two disc set isn't probably going to be worth it for you. There's also a booklet on Charles and the making of the film. The single disc edition of the movie is presented in the dreaded dual sided, dual layered format. Why dreaded? Because this format doesn't stand up to wear and tear as well. Universal probably should have released this two editions; a two disc set (vs. the dual layered, dual sided version) and a three disc set at affordable prices. Surely if other studios can release the two disc sets and make a profit, then Universal can as well.<br /><br /> Taylor Hackford's incisive commentary track tackles a wide range of topics from the challenges of shooting the film, recreating the past and the wonder and awe he felt working with both Foxx and Charles. Hackford also documents where the film veers from reality and the dramatic reasons why. It's one of the few solo commentary tracks worth listening to from beginning to end.<br /><br /> A flawed masterpiece, Ray would have been a better film if the 25 minutes of additional footage had been integrated into this DVD in a better fashion than it is. Nevertheless, Hackford's passion for music and interest in the subject along with the terrific performances from Foxx and the rest of the cast makes this an essential purchase for fans of Charles' music. Although the portrait it paints is frequently less than complimentary and unpleasant, it also allows us to understand the passion that drove this singular artist to help create a unique sound in music.</p></body></html>

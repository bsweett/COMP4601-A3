But that doesn't matter, for three reasons: (a) perhaps no one outside the world of espionage knows what really happened, (b) the movie is self-described as only "inspired by" real events, and (c) what matters is the broader message, not the details.<br /><br />And that broader message is quite obvious, indeed commonplace, if you can rise above a strongly partisan viewpoint.  The message is that when two distinct and clannish groups desperately want the same piece of land as their home, and neither group can eliminate the other, conflict and violence will tend to be perpetuated, resulting in a lose-lose outcome.  At the same time, there's some hope of compromise and peace if each group comes to recognize the faults in its own ideology and actions, appreciates that the other side isn't entirely wrong, and recognizes a shared humanity.  So there are two tensions operating in parallel: (a) between the two groups, and (b) within each group, between making concessions in order to compromise versus continuing to fight (at whatever mutual cost) until the other group has been utterly defeated.  At a more specific level, a related message is that assassinations and terrorism may keep pressure on the other side, but they ultimately only contribute to perpetuating the conflict rather than resolving it.<br /><br />The movie depicts all of this quite clearly, and thereby does a service in helping us better understand the problem.  At nearly 3 hours, it's quite long, but it kept my attention, so I didn't mind.  As some reviewers have noted (ignore the extremists), it isn't a perfect movie (hence my 4-star rating), but I still recommend it to people who want to better understand why these types of conflicts are so difficult to resolve.<br /><br />Finally, here's my proposed solution to the problem.  Forget about the current Palestinian territories and instead give the northmost third of Israel to the Palestinians.  Provide the Palestinians with quality infrastructure, fully cover their relocation costs, and provide them with plenty of seed money, all of this paid for by Israel and international aid.  Help the Palestinians establish a credible democratic government with adequate military backing.  Last but not least, place Jerusalem under UN control, with everyone having guaranteed safe access to it, including a dedicated highway from the new Palestine to Jerusalem.  That's all it takes: allow each group to continue to exist, physically seperate the two groups, allow each group to have quality land within the current territory, and throw some money at the problem where needed.  Can we please implement this solution soon, so that everyone can move on to other issues?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good Film"></head><body><p>The DVD features great video quality but the sound was a tad too muffled at times. Moving on, the film reminds me of Se7en in a few ways with lesser chilling scenes. Because of my diehard love for Hilary Swank, I wish she had more of a role or had been completely left out. Robin Williams is good at times but I really don't think he's the ideal person for the villain slot. The hero of the film is Al Pacino who acted pretty good. The 24hour day theme in the film was very good and the locations were good too. I liked how the film played around with guilt and duty.<br /><br />Overall a good film but I've seen better.<br /><br />Some others films you will want to watch if you like this film are "One Hour Photo" , "Heat" , "Seven" and "Along Came The Spider"</p></body></html>

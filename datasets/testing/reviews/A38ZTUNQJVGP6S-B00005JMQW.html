<meta name="summary" content="Better then the original"></head><body><p>This movie is 2 hour and 7 minutes long and better then the original. What makes it better is there is more action and roll along at a good pace. With the origin of how Spiderman came to be out of the way, the movie kicks right in. Peter Parker has put his social life on hold and has taken to crime fighting fulltime; which puts a damper on his college studies and work life. Now there is a new villian, Doc Ock. He has four mechanical arms. So I guess if you add his own arm and legs gives reason to an octopus; which has eight tentacles. This is a great movie all around.</p></body></html>

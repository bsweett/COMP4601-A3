<meta name="summary" content="AN INTRIGUING DOCU-DRAMA."></head><body><p>"JFK" is a movie that combines drama with a documentary style, and it's a shocking experience for many reasons. The movie was made back on those days when Kevin Costner was a superstar in a hot streak, with movies like "Dances With Wolves" and "Bull Durham", and in this movie Costner gave one of his finest performances. He was the centerpiece of this daring and powerful movie.<br /><br />But he was not alone, Oliver Stone surrounded him with an all-star cast, that includes big names like Sissy Spacek, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, John Candy, Donald Sutherland, Walter Matthau, Wayne Knight and Vincent D'Onofrio.<br /><br />"JFK" is built with theories, some of them are obviously fiction or just a mere supposition, but a lot of them seem authentic and based in real evidence. Oliver Stone pointed the finger to almost everybody: the FBI, the CIA, Lyndon Johnson, J. Edgar Hoover, Clay Shaw and many others. But he seems to hit the center of the target when he practically says that Kennedy was murdered because he didn't wanted to take part in the HUGE industry that is the war, an industry that moves BILLIONS of dollars, and a big part of USA's economical power.<br /><br />"JFK" presented an innovative narrative style, it combined real footage with acted scenes, but the acted parts were processed as historical footage, he also used a fast, dynamic editing to create interest in the audience, and of course "JFK" is interesting and provocative at all time. "JFK" has great acting (although John Candy was over the top, and some hair wigs are just hilarious), great direction, a solid script (yes, some theories are too forced, but there are solid theories as well), and the movie achieves its biggest goal: the movie gives something to think about to the viewer.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Food For Thought!"></head><body><p>Michael Moore once again gives us another documentary that is very thought provoking. This time Moore's attention has turned to the US Health Care System.... "Sicko" doesn't focus on the 50 million Americans without health insurance, but the 250 million Americans whom are insured. Plus, "Sicko" also focuses on how the US health care system rates with other countries, like Canada, France, England & Cuba.<br /><br />I was really shocked at what I learned about health insurance companies here in the US after watching "Sicko"... and was surprised to learn about how well universal health care systems work so great for those that live in countries with this type of health care system. It appears that a universal health care system is the way to go after watching "Sicko". It begs the question: "If universal health care is working so great in other countries, then why aren't we implementing here in the US?".<br /><br />Not knowing the full scoop/impact of how universal health care really works/effects nations that use this type of health care system, it is truly difficult to say whether our health care system or universal health care is really the way to go. "Sicko" makes a great case for the use of a universal health care system, but is there more than meets the eye?</p></body></html>

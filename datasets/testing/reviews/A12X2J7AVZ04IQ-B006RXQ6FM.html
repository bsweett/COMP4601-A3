<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant Ensemble Cast"></head><body><p>A lot of plays don't adapt well to the screen ("Love! Valour! Compassion!" anyone?); here we have a successful play being directed by the playwright. What could go wrong? Actually, NOTHING! I still don't understand why Cherry Jones didn't repeat her Tony-winning role, but the Sister Aloysius of Meryl Streep is as centered as it could be. The entire cast is flawless, and the film allows some latitude in location that the play didn't. Very talky, intelligent, fast-paced, and thoroughly focused, I haven't been so impressed in a long time. Some say Amy Adams didn't deserve her Oscar nom, but I strongly disagree. Also, young Joseph Foster, as the catalyst of the controversy, is a talented young man, and I wish him well. I recommend this film highly. I can't remember when I was so impressed by an acting ensemble. Not a weak one in the bunch. A real treat!</p></body></html>

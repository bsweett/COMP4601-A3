While the details of the film are not 100% historically accurate, I was always impressed by the fact that Elizabeth Berridge, Simon Callow, and Nicholas Kepros each bear a striking resemblance to contemporary illustrations of Constanze Weber Mozart, Emmanuel Schickaneder, and Archbishop Collorado. As for Tom Hulce's irascible Mozart, the blue-eyed brat among Emperor Joseph II's court composers, I still have the oil pastel drawing I did of him in a scene from the movie hanging in my house. I've always felt that he was cheated out of the Oscar for Best Actor of 1984. It's as if the Academy felt it would be too scandalous to let an &quot;Animal House &quot; alumni have an Oscar. In truth, Hulce's Mozart seems to be a carry-over of his role in &quot;Animal House&quot; at times. But he was absolutely brilliant in the part. In the more serious scenes as Mozart's career problems mount, and he first encounters the Man in Black (who, in reality, was a man in gray), his face resembles that of Ryan O'Neal's &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;, another 18th century character, and I wonder if Milos Forman hired him for that reason. Roy Dotrice was solemn and dignified as the father who is no longer able to keep his child prodigy son or his career on track. In Jeffery Jones' first scenes as the Emperor Joseph, he resembled a one-dimensional painting; There was nothing one-dimensional about his performance, in which he could be very indecisive about the technicalities about music, but very firm on the issues of appropriate pieces for theatre. Some years ago, a revamped version of Peter Shaffer's stage play of &quot;Amadeus&quot; made its debut in the town where I live, and the play was definitely Salieri's show. In this film, F. Murray Abraham's Salieri, who, in reality probably didn't have a thing to do with Mozart's death, is a somber, embittered character, who could have had an easier life if he had confronted Mozart head-on about his shortcomings instead of scheming to destroy him. Elizabeth Berridge's Constanze is strong and supportive as Mozart's wife. She could hold her own against her husbands' unsavory cohorts when she had to, proving that the women of that era weren't always as passive as they may have seemed, although she still seemed overwhelmed by her husband's excessive behavior. A contemporary magazine review of &quot;Amadeus&quot; complained that the other Court composers were too subservient, but apparently, this is a realistic portrayal of the 18th century Austrian Court, and what American audiences tend to overlook is that people close enough to world leaders understand how difficult their jobs can be, and aren't as likely to contradict an Emperor on comparatively minor issues such as the theatre. In a smaller, less complex country like 18th century Austria certain forms of censorship, such as those advocated by Joseph II, may have been necessary to keep order. A pre-&quot;Sex and the City&quot; era Cynthia Nixon is a wide-eyed and frightened servant named Lorl, who witnesses the decline of the Great Composer, and is paid for her services by Salieri. The decline of Mozart is depicted with all the modern sensationalism of the demise of any young celebrity. We watch as Mozart's supporters either die or slip away, and as his impracticality with money affects his lifestyle, health, and his closest relationships. One wishes that there had been more understanding of child prodigies back then, and of their need for some normalcy in their lives, even though Mozart himself may not have been saved even by that. Ultimately, we see his life as a glorious, musical romp through a Rococo-decorated kaleidescope with a world of palaces and opera houses, the spreading of his music's popularity among the commoners of the land, and finally spiraling downward to an early and tragic death, which was poignantly, but not accurately portrayed in the movie. The final scenes of the Mozarts together tug at the heartstrings as the dying composer reconciles with his wife, and the funeral scene is devastating. Amadeus...The name means beloved of God, and happily, the film bearing this name was the beloved of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.</p></body></html>

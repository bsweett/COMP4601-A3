<meta name="summary" content="Comparing the '08 and '03 versions"></head><body><p>I just viewed the '03 and '08 versions back to back and it's interesting comparing their strengths and weaknesses because they're essentially the same movie. The main difference is that the '08 version omits the conflict Bruce has with his father and exchanges the Absorbing Man (Bruce's father) for the Abomination.<br /><br />The 2008 version starts out better than the 2003 version, more interesting and entertaining, but tends to lose steam by the third act with the ultra-cartooney fight between Hulk and the Abomination. By contrast, the '03 version starts out slow and relatively boring but strongly revives interest by the 90-minute mark when the Hulk has that spectacular rampage that starts in the desert and ends in San Francisco, which lasts a whole 22 minutes. In fact, this rampage is easily one of the most entertaining action pieces in the history of cinema and worth the price of admission. The '08 version has some quality action, for sure, but nothing that even comes close to the main rampage in the '03 version.<br /><br />Edward Norton in the '08 version plays a better Bruce Banner than Eric Bana. Not that Bana isn't likable, it's just that he's simply too much of a tall, muscleman to fit the role. He looks like he could kick some serious arse without even becoming the Hulk, which takes away from the whole concept.<br /><br />Although the Hulk in the '08 version has a grittier overall appearance, the filmmakers opted for a snot-greened hue, whereas the '03 Hulk has a better shade of green. Furthermore, '03 Hulk looks more realistic and less cartooney, although the facial features of the '08 Hulk are excellent.<br /><br />The '03 version also shows the Hulk jumping around with incredible leaps - almost flying - as he does in the comics, which the '08 version barely implies. The likely reason for this is that the filmmakers rightly realized they couldn't even touch Ang Lee's film in this area.<br /><br />Of course the '03 Hulk is bogged down by the origin story, while the '08 version breezes through it in literally 3 minutes. To make matters worse for the '03 version, changes were made that slow the story down and needlessly complicate it. In the comic Bruce Banner became the Hulk after accidentally being exposed to gamma rays from a huge government test-bomb in the desert. In Hulk '03 the Hulk's origin is complicated by being tied to Bruce's mad scientist father who experimented on him when he was a little boy. Although one has to allow some latitude in comic-to-film translation these changes definitely slow the story down and make the origin less immediately gratifying. BUT it does offer a father/son conflict to the table.<br /><br />The '08 version changes the Hulk's origin as well, making it similar to the TV show, plus tying it in to the "super soldier" serum. The '08 version wins the prize on this front.<br /><br />Some say that the '08 version opts for brawn over the brainy approach of the '03 version, but -- with the exception of Hulk's fight with the Abomination at the end -- this isn't even remotely true. Each film has a lot of drama and I was impressed with the reverent, realistic tone both films have in their non-hulk portions. Banner's relationship with Betty Ross is particularly well-done and moving, especially in the '08 version. Great job by the principles here -- Bana, Norton, Jennifer Connelley and Liv Tyler.<br /><br />Great soundtracks in both versions.<br /><br />So, both films are quality Hulk flicks with some great moments and the '03 version with its spectacular 22-minute Hulk rampage, but each have their strengths and weaknesses. Take the best parts of both and you'd have an incredible Hulk film! (Sorry)<br /><br />Needless to say, if you're a Hulk fan it's necessary to purchase BOTH films.<br /><br />GRADE: B+</p></body></html>

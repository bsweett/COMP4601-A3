<meta name="summary" content="IN THIS CORNER, PREDATOR! AND IN THIS CORNER, ALIEN!"></head><body><p>This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The aliens and the predators were cool, awesome, tough, nasty, and wicked stellar, and the woman who was the protagonist was a hot babe, too! There were a lot of fights, much suspense, very good special effects, and on top  of it all a happy ending. I won't give away the ending or the movie  but I will say that anybody who likes science fiction or monster movies should see this without a second thought. It gets 9 stars out of 10.</p></body></html>

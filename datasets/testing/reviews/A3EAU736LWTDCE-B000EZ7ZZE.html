<meta name="summary" content="way better than the first one"></head><body><p>I didn't care for the first one. I thought it was too slow. This one however revived the series. As the rating board says on the movie, in fine print under the R rating "Non stop violence and gore" need I say more?<br />It was a very good movie. My only problem is I hate matrix type movies and James bond type of movies, meaning: Impossible feats that not only leave you saying "yea right" but also are so outrageous they are laughable at best. Ex: she runs down a building on a rope. I thought that was not only impossible, but way cheesy. Movies need to stay away from the Charlie's angels mentality! You begin to stop taking it seriously when you see too much of this. Another nit-pick I have is the fast camera battle sequences. ITS ANNOYING! we all know the scenes. Where the camera moves so fast all you here is grunts from the battle, and a snippet of gore. Hold the camera still you moron!<br />Anyway, awesome movie.</p></body></html>

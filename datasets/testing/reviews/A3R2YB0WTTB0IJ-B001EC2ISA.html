<meta name="summary" content="ONE OF THE FIRST MOVIES OF AN AUTHENTIC ARTIST"></head><body><p>Tim Burton is a guy Hollywood should honor every day. He's one of the few who agree to stay in the system and direct personal movies for the majors.<p>And his personal world is something very special. Things have a soul or, at least, come to life under Burton's camera. <p>Beetlejuice is one of the first efforts of Tim Burton and it's already great. There's a style, a signature, a world , details which reveal an authentic creator.<p>It's possible you will hate this world but you will not have losed two hours, I guarantee you. Come and see what can be created with a camera and a little brain. <p>A DVD I'm proud to have in my collection.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""A mother's a boy's best friend.." This movie's my best friend!"></head><body><p>This movie is probably my favorite Hitchcock movie. It's famous for the "shower" scene, but believe, that's only halfway through the movie, it gets only better from there and ends with a highly unpredictable and classic Hitchcock ending.<br />The story is about a woman who is given money by her boss to place in his account. But, she decides to take it and run off with it. She does so, so that she would be able to live a wonderful life with her boyfriend. She stops at a motel out of town and is the only one there. Once there she meets Norman Bates, the owner, played with perfection by Anthony Perkins. She knows that Norman's a strange man as his mother lives in a large mansion up on a hill and the woman always hears Norman argue with his mom. And then, the woman is murdered while taking a shower. You're lead to believe that it's by the mother but you never will know the truth until the very end. And then, the woman's sister and boyfriend go and investigate her strange dissapearance. Hitchcock is at his best, believe me and this old thriller is way better and delivers much more frights than all the new horror movies. This smart movie is built around Anthony Perkins and his tremendous acting skills.<br />Hitchcock is probably the best director of all time. He has created in the 1950s a movie that is better and that delivers more frights that any movie now.<br />This is his best movie of all time. It is quite frankly a perfect movie. It has no faults whatsoever. The acting is spot on, the cinematography is great, the thrills are constant and the twist is brilliant. My only regret is that I hadn't seen it before the ending had been given away.<br />The score though is my favorite part of the movie. To me, the score is a crucial aspect of movies. The one here is chilling. The best of all time. Right from the opening credits, you can tell that this score is fantastic. It's plain creepy and the chords at each stab in the shower scene are spot on.<br />The most ingenious thing about Hitchcock is that the shower scene here shows no nudity whatsoever. That is brilliant. How he somehow films it without that is extraordianry.<br />It's pointless to write a longer review because everyone know the genious of this movie. Just buy it already.</p></body></html>

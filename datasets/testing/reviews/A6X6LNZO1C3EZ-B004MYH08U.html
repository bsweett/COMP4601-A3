Story is based upon a party animal playboy who inherits his father's multi-million dollar newspaper company, and then teams up with a martial arts trained engineer genius who together fight crime and corruption.  "The Green Hornet" originates in 1936 as a masked vigilante comic book hero that was popularized by a radio series.  Since then there have been many, many remakes of the classic story.  This 2011 release with Seth Rogen, Jay Chou, and Cameron Diaz has all the necessary gadgets and action, as well as several well-known actors who are actually fairly convincing in their roles during the film.  Best part of the movie of course is the climax of battles that takes place inside the newspaper company building where the bad guys wage an all out war on the Green Hornet and Kato.  The movie has star power, but actually is fairly well done (instead of the typical famous cast of has-beens who think their name and a few lucky roles make up for a crappy performance), this time everybody in the film pulled their weight.  The sets made me feel poorer than a church mouse's servant, but hey, I enjoyed the film anyway.  Sort of like having pigs in a blanket and a coke.  A nice change from the ordinary.</p></body></html>

He is tough, savvy, quick-thinking and ruthless, while being surrounded by dangerous characters.  He is approached by a young woman, played by Mary Astor, who says that her sister has been taken away by a man that she wants Spade to find.  As the movie progresses, Spade discovers that she has created a tangled web of intrigue.  She, a young-looking Peter Lorre, and a Sidney Greenstreet character are in search of the priceless Maltese Falcon statue and will pay any price to acquire it.  Spade matches wits with them in a seemingly effortless way, but does pay an emotional price at the end.  The dialogue is snappy and the plot moves rapidly in this classic, which has definitely stood the test of time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better....."></head><body><p>i enjoyed the first two movies, but this one is better. They hired a good<br />director for this one that keeps the movie flowing pretty good. The script keeps the action going at a nice pace and never gets boring. There<br />is a zombie crows section that put the movie ' kaw ' to shame.<br />  So get some popcorn and get ready to be entertained if you like this<br />kind of movie.</p></body></html>

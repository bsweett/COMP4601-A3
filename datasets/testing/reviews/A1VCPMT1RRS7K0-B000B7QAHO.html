It had a magical aura about it, with all of the crazy creations in the factory and the eccentric and fascinating Mr. Wonka.<br /><br />This version is a good modern-day representation of the movie.  The sets are outstanding and creatively done.  The Oompa Loompas are slightly more disturbing in this version (which may have something to do with the fact that they're all played by a single actor), but they're entertaining.  There is a slight twist in plot in this version, as you get to delve a bit more deeply into Willy Wonka's childhood, but I feel it works within the story.<br /><br />This movie certainly has the Tim Burton stamp on it.  Even if you didn't know he was the director, you would be able to draw similarities between the feel of this movie and his others such as Edward Scissorhands.  It's worth a watch.</p></body></html>

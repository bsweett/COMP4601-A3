<meta name="summary" content=""Now, the next part is very important: They're going to take you.""></head><body><p>As if the lousy economy isn't enough of a reason to say "Hells to the no!" when your kids plead and beg to go on a European trip, here comes TAKEN, a film which you can show on a back-to-back-to-back screening marathon along with the HOSTEL frightfests. That should make the kids waver a bit. And I bet those poor souls in HOSTEL were wishing for a parent like Liam Neeson. My favorite part of TAKEN may well be the low key yet very ominous promise Neeson makes on the phone to the kidnappers who had just snatched his daughter. I got de shivers of anticipation up and down the spine, watching him make this little speech in the film trailer; in the actual film, it resonates with even more power.<br /><br />- Liam Neeson's character: "I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have... are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that will be the end of it. I will not look for you. I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you. I will find you. And I will kill you."<br />- The response: "Good luck."<br /><br />Oh, it is so on now, brother!<br /><br />Plot, simple: Ex-black ops agent Bryan Mills (Neeson) retired so that he can spend time with his neglected 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), although nowadays Kim doesn't really have much time for him. But she manages to guilt him into signing his permission for her to go holidaying in Europe. Mills doesn't like it one bit. He knows how the real world works, but his daughter just wants to follow a rock band as it tours across Europe. Mills' worst fears surface when Kim and her friend are promptly kidnapped in Paris. But Bryan Mills isn't your ordinary dad and he immediately leaps into action.<br /><br />Clocking in at slightly over an hour and a half, TAKEN is a stripped-down bare-knuckled thriller, doesn't try to be fancy, doesn't overcomplicate the story. It's about a father, trained in espionage and combat, willing to do whatever is needed, willing to take on anyone in his way, to get his daughter back. And that's it. Above all, this movie works because it's Liam Neeson propelling the story. Neeson is a first-rate actor and the man can convey seething rage and righteous fury like nobody's business. And, for someone in his 50s, he brings such big physical presence to the screen that you buy into his character being this dangerous and capable and ruthless.<br /><br />A geriatric version of Jack Bauer? Yes - this man does not eff around. Some of the brutal things Mills resorts to has him straddling the fence between good guy and villain. But I tend to forgive him, given what's driving him. But, heh, it's pretty much a given that his friendship with his French contact is now effectively ruined.<br /><br />Holes in the film? Yes, some. Although it's just about a given that Mills is able to survive hail after hail of bullets; that just seems to go with the territory, in these films. But Bryan Mills, impressive spy skills aside, does get by some on preposterous sheer luck (especially with the jacket). And then, after wreaking so much havoc in Paris, he seemingly is able to get out of France with his daughter fairly easily. See, father and daughter reunite and hug it out in Paris. Next thing you know, they're strolling in L.A.X. (although, okay, for all we know, they may have spent frustrating weeks in Paris swimming thru red tape; the movie doesn't indicate how much time has elapsed). My biggest gripe lies in the shakedown scene, when Mills accosts the Albanians in their HQ and pretends to be French authority - while talking in English with not even a French accent, much less actually speaking in French. And the saps buy this? Unless, of course, Mills pulled the old Jedi mind trick on them. In which case, it all makes sense.<br /><br />But I'm just nagging. Liam Neeson is so good an actor that for the most part he sweeps you into his character's obsessed hunt. Irregardless of plot inconsistencies and action movie cliches, TAKEN turns out to be a lean and mean thriller, and worth watching. And Liam Neeson, he runs this joint.</p></body></html>

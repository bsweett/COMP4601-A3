Teaser trailer, Theatrical Trailer, extensive storyboard commentary, a huge production notes write up which is one of the most impressive I have ever seen on a DVD and the full uncut version of the film which I think is a masterful display of genius special effects and sadly missed moments that should not have been cut from the film.  You simply have to see the movie to understand why because I think the MPAA is just a bunch of bureaucratic c*cksuckers.  Excellent sound and picture quality!  Outstanding DVD interactive menus and an overall great package.  This DVD is a keeper!  Get lucky and buy yours now!</p></body></html>

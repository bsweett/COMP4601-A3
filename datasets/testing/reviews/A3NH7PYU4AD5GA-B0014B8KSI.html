The plot outlines are rather tired: how often did we have this story of the bad big corporation and the class action suit and then Erin Brockovich fighting for the little man? I am not saying it is unreal or wrong, but it is used up.<br />And how often did we have the hero with his head barely above the waterline, with problems of family, gambling, career, debts... Who suddenly finds himself in the position to do good? or something resembling it? And who does become a hero against the odds?<br />Not much to expect there. And then, there is Clooney pulling it off. The man is amazing. And he gets great support from Wilkinson and Swinton and together they produce an admittedly slow but always gripping plot.<br />Say, why not Clooney for President? If you can't make up your mind between race and gender, why not settle for an improved version of a Hollywood actor? You were so taken in by the last one, Clooney would be better.</p></body></html>

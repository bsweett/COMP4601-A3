<meta name="summary" content="A heart movie not an Art movie..."></head><body><p>While the movie may have its flaws, it succeeds well as a time-twisting tale of star-crossed lovers. While the superb Bruce Willis movie 12 Monkeys was more powerful and dramatic in the way it explored temporal paradoxes, The Lake House still manages to achieve the same spine-tingly feel at all of its peak moments.<br /><br />To me, the story is allegorical, in that we are all star-crossed lovers, and that we are constantly at the effect of time and destiny, of missed opportunities and beautiful moments of convergence.<br /><br />While the mailbox acts as a time portal for their communications, our subconscious minds, our collective sixth sense, can act the same way, if we could just be still and learn to listen to our hearts.<br /><br />A sweet movie, and a very intelligent 'love will find a way' feel-good movie. Not too many of those around.</p></body></html>

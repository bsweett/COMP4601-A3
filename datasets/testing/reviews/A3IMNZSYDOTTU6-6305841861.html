It was also good thanks to the acting kitsch of Bruce Campbell and company, but Campbell made the cut. Now with the idea that another 'Dead' movie would follow, could it match up to the kitsch and scares of the first? You bet!<br /><br />EVIL DEAD 2: Dead By Dawn is ultimately more a campy, funny, and scarier re-make of the first film (although it is a sequel, it's more a reinvisioning of the first film with better elements). It even approaches a sort of "looney tunes" type status with some of its scares, especially the moment where Ash's girlfriend spins out in front with her head popping off and then back on (this is after ash decapitated her and buried her out front).<br /><br />Back to the woods we go, for another round. Ash comes to the cabin (or cottage, whatever you want to call it) with girlfriend Linda (not the same one from the first) for a relaxing getaway, and ultimately finds an device and plays the tape in it and incantations once again summon our evil spirit fiends from the woods. The real beginning of the film is terrific, with the "force" plowing through the woods, the cabin, through the front door and, ultimately, to our hero, possessing him until the rise of the sun. A new group of people decide to visit the cabin themselves, and then the mayhem ultimately proceeds to ensue, with one of the funniest being mother locked in the basement (remember the creepy moments in the basement in the first movie? those are nothing compared to the moments in this one), trying to trick her daughter into letting her out. The best moments of the film come when Ash's hand decides to take on a mind of its own after his hand gets bit by one of the possessed newcomers, and Ash hacks it off and links his hand-less arm to a chainsaw (could that be an homage to Texas Chainsaw? Nah!). This movie has more laughs than the first one does, but it still does have its very creepy moments, with the frenzied camera angles returning; the possessed woods capturing a woman and, near the end, ultimately coming to life to batter the cabin while Ash and one person struggle against the forces in the woods; the big giant scary, but really quite amusing, face that appears in the doorway before being sucked into the portal, which ultimately sucks our hero into another time, leading into the camp ARMY OF DARKNESS, which is by all means a true completion to this ever scary but truly fun trilogy. It, like its predecessor, has a great ending...you will truly appreciate the work Raimi put into this film, with Bruce Campbell (now one of my favorite actors) back in top form with his manic and frenzied performance.<br /><br />DEAD BY DAWN is the ultimate follow-up to a cult favorite, and the third and final installment of the series would very much end the series on a campy note. Would this be the last we hear from our buddies Campbell and Raimi? Definitely not. Was ARMY OF DARKNESS the last EVIL DEAD? Only time will tell. Is EVIL DEAD 2 worth your watch? Absolutely.</p></body></html>

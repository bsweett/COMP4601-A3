They did say that it wasn't anything that they expected and they said that it was as equally funny as disturbing. I enjoyed the young girls performance as Haley. He mannerisms were just perfect when she was doing the young girl part. The guy who played the photographer/predator was also very good. It was one of those movies where you just loved seeing this guy who is a real scum get tormented.<br /><br />Good flick</p></body></html>

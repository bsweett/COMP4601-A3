<meta name="summary" content="Indy Rides Again"></head><body><p>I had a big grin on my face throughout this entire film.  I laughed out loud in many places, and cheered the characters on in others.  After 20 years, Indy is back, and so is the fun and excitement.<br /><br />As with every film in the series, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull starts off at warp speed and never lets up.  Like its three predecessors, this very entertaining film is full action, adventure, excitement, thrills, chases, true love and, yes, even camp.  Did I know what was going to happen pretty much every step of the way?  Of course, but it all happened exactly the way I wanted it to.  It was typical Indiana Jones, full of references and homage to the past films, and I did not need it to be anything else.<br /><br />Harrison Ford is once again brilliant in his portrayal of our hero.  At 65, he is still handsome, sexy, believable, and true to character.  And as always, he gets the girl.  Karen Allen is wonderful reprising her role of Marion Ravenwood.  She doesn't look like she has aged a bit, and she is absolutely terrific.  The chemistry between Indy and Marion is palpable.  Shia Labeouf as Mutt Williams does quite a remarkable job.  His high-speed sword fight through the Amazon is amazing and memorable.  I have to say the ants were an inspired choice for this film's requisite creepy-crawly scene.  We live in an area swarming with fire ants. I HATE ANTS.<br /><br />As always, John Williams' musical score is rousing and fills you with anticipation.  As the music set the perfect stage for all of the film's action, I found my self humming along with the familiar and well loved theme.  This is one that I can't get out of my head, and I don't really want to.<br /><br />Set in the 1950s, smack in the middle of McCarthyism, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull brings the Indiana Jones franchise into a new era. It is jam packed with classic and clich&eacute; 1950s references, from motorcycles and greasers, atomic bombs, Roswell and little green men, and the red menace. Overall, this film isn't supposed to be particularly serious (and neither were the others!). It is supposed to be a fun and enjoyable continuation of a well loved story.<br /><br />And I think it succeeded.  As the credits rolled, the audience applauded and cheered.  I highly recommend this film for the entire family.</p></body></html>

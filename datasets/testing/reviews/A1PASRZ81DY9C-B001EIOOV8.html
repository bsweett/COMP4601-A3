<meta name="summary" content="Just Almost There and Then Literally Falls Flat. Casting Sharon Stone in This One was a Very BAD Idea."></head><body><p>Viewed: 6/04, 3/09<br />Rate: 6<br /><br />3/09: Casino is the third film with the collaboration of Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Frank Vincent, and others. While the film is mostly a rehash of the styles and moments from Raging Bull and Goodfellas, Casino seemed to work well for me the first eighty minutes. I kept thinking to myself, "Why doesn't the film deserve a `10'?" Then the next hundred minutes answered my question. Let's focus on the first part first. I thought the editing work was not too bad but kinda excessive because of the many short lived scenes. It felt rushed, but I got the gist of what Las Vegas is all about and how Ace Rothstein does his job. Then, I was introduced to the characters as well as the many subplots. That was working out good for me until the second part came. There, I felt that the subplots were being poorly capitalized on, and more of the different characters came without knowing who the heck they are. The drama between Ace Rothstein and his wife was utterly unconvincing and didn't add very much to the movie. Joe Pesci had his moments throughout Casino yet his character is not well-developed. Rather, he is used as a tool just to stretch the time of the film. Having written that, it would have been a lot better for Martin Scorsese to cut one hour out of the film just to keep the tension tight. Instead, he probably thought that he could get away with it by letting the editing go loose and geting lazy with the running time. Increasingly, Casino was becoming about the colors of the Robert De Niro's suits, lights of Las Vegas, and Sharon Stone's wardrobe instead of built-up intense moments of explosion that are too familiar in Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and Cape Fear. Robert De Niro isn't too bad in his role in Casino, but he could have been given much more respect for his character's development. I would have to say that De Niro's role is almost the last time he was ever good. On the other hand, what's with Sharon Stone? She was a major distraction to Casino. I was mostly peeved by the lack of development in the overall story. All in all, Casino is not too bad of a film but falls as a victim to excessive running time and all-around poor direction. The rating of Casino is unchanged.</p></body></html>

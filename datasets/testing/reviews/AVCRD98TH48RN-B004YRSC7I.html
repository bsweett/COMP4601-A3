Once in a while a film or filmmaker comes along and completely destroys all conventional ideas about how to make a movie.  This film is told in reverse order and by the end it completes a loop where the viewer could push 'play' on his DVD player and continue with the story, forever.  From the very first scene it is obvious that something unusual is about to happen.  The photography itself is run in reverse to set the tone of the story.  Not to be lost in the disjointed narrative are three great acting performances from Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, and most notably the lead actor, Guy Pearce, whose role in "L.A. Confidential" began my personal respect for his talent.  This is high quality filmmaking on all levels.  It is true that the first time I saw this, by movie's end, I wanted to scream.  The director, Christopher Nolan, forces the audience to remember each previous scene in detail leading up to the end, thus making the audience identify with the main character who suffers from short-term memory loss.  This is a unique film, and I am proud to have it in my collection.  Later.</p></body></html>

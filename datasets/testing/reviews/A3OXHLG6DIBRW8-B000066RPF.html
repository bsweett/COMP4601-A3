<meta name="summary" content=""It's Not the Real Grail?" - Highly Recommended!"></head><body><p>Somewhat of a guilty pleasure, "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" is one of my top 5 movies. Those that like Monty Python will like this movie, but I have shown it some folks who do not "get it" or are offended by the religious and sexual content.<br /><br />That being said, this movie contains some of the funniest scenes ever put into a film and is very quotable. My wife and I find ourselves saying, "It's not the real grail?", "I shall taunt you a second time", "One, two, five...", and oh so many others as the occasion fits. We have not allowed our children to watch it, so the quoting is fairly annoying to them, but sooner or later they will watch it and "get it", just not with me.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></body></html>

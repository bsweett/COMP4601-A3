<meta name="summary" content="Heaven Sent"></head><body><p>The first big screen outing for Charlie and his Angels is girlpower driven entertainment at its most fun.<br /> <p>  The Angels are assigned to watch over a computer geek who has designed a special computer defense program that can, if fallen into the wrong hands, cause major havok among the world population. However, the geek is actually an undercover operative who holds a secret grudge against Charlie (he holds Charlie responsible for his father's death in Vietnam) and tries to due away with Charlie and trying to make real angels out of the Angels. <p>  The film doesn't take itself to seriously (come on people, its based on a T&amp;A show from the 70's!). The casting of Barrymore, Liu, and Diaz is admirable. Some guys I talked to about the film didn't acutally like the girls, but, I always say if it's 2 in the morning and these girls show up at your front door asking to use the phone because of car problems, I wouldn't slam the door in there faces! Bill Murray gets quite a few laughs as Bosley and Sam Rockwell is great as the villian. The soundtrack is pretty good, mixing different tunes from the past few decades. Overall, a decent and enjoyable rental.</p></body></html>

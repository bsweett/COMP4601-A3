<meta name="summary" content="This is the movie for people who love movies..."></head><body><p>A case of mistaken identity sends a charming advertising executive on a cross country adventure filled with terror, murder and, believe it or not, love.  Yes, `North by Northwest' is Alfred Hitchcock at his finest.  Engrossing, deceptive and visually stunning; this is the type of `no holds bar' entertainment that keeps you glued to your seat throughout and begging for more upon the roll of the credits.<br /><br />The ever so dapper Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, a man mistaken to be a undercover agent by enemy spies.  When they fail to kill him he winds up getting himself in deep with the feds as his story about kidnapping and spies seems as preposterous as it is convoluted.  Roger has to then take maters into his own hands in order to save his own life.  This is when he meets the beautiful Eve Kendall, and as soon as sparks begin to fly his whole world gets flipped upside down.<br /><br />I don't want to give away too much, but the great thing about Hitchcock is being able to experience it the way he intended; knowing very little.  The more you know the less you can truly be surprised by everything that Hitchcock has in store for you; and believe me, he has a lot in store with this one.<br /><br />From the stunning sets to the brilliantly choreographed stunts, this is a complete package; a marvelously crafted action thriller that actually has substance.  It doesn't trim away the intelligence to deliver a half hearted spectacle but balances the two brilliantly, as do most of Hitchcock's films.  The film is clever as all get out, which makes watching Roger get himself in and then out of trouble so much fun.  The performances are also very good here.  Cary Grant is an actor I am not very familiar with, but general consensus of his work is that he is more charm than depth.  I found him a perfect balance of both here, able to fluctuate effortlessly between his emotions and his characters grasp of his situation.  James Mason is amazing as the sinister Phillip Vandamm and Eva Marie Saint is stellar as Roger's love interest Eve.  She has this sensuality that permeates her scenes and draws us into her mystery.<br /><br />LOVE IT!<br /><br />Anyways, I totally recommend this one.  Like I said, I fear for saying too much so I'm cutting this one short.  It is totally worth it though, for any film fan.  It is just a great film, no matter which way you look at it.  Even those who are not fans of Hitchcock (like my wife) can enjoy this film.  If you love movies, you'll love this.</p></body></html>

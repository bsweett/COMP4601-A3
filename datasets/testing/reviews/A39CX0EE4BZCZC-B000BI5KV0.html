<meta name="summary" content="Almost Too Amazing To Describe"></head><body><p>This documentary showing what a group of penguins goes through on a yearly basis in Antarctica is almost too unbelievable to express in words. To use the clich&eacute;, you have to see this to believe it.<br /><br />When I saw it, I remember almost being stunned afterward at what I had just seen, and then thinking about it for a few days afterward, which is not something I usually do. It was just a haunting, unbelievable story....and 100 percent true, not one of these "based on a true story" fiascoes.<br /><br />The hardships that these flightless birds endure to keep their species going is almost impossible to believe. I have yet to hear a friend say anything less about this than I just said: all of them were amazed.</p></body></html>

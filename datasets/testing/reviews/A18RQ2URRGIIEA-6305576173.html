<meta name="summary" content=""I am not a Frankenstein. I'm a Fronkensteen.""></head><body><p>In 1974, the same year that Mel Brooks' film "Blazing Saddles" was making people laugh at theaters around the world, Mel Brooks teamed with Gene Wilder to write a hilarious film spoof of Mary Shelley's (1797-1851) classic 1818 short story "Frankenstein", as well as the many twentieth-century horror films that the story inspired.  The result was the film entitled "Young Frankenstein" that Mel Brooks directed and starring Gene Wilder as the fictitious Dr. Frederick Frankenstein, the grandson of the more famous Frankenstein from Shelley's short story.  Frederick, embarrassed by his grandfather's unethical medical practices, pronounced the family name as Fronkensteen to try and disassociate himself from his heritage; but when Frederick inherits the family's castle in Transylvania, he has no choice but to return to the family home.  There, he finds two of his grandfather's assistants still taking care of the castle: Frau Bl&uuml;cher (Cloris Leachman) and Igor (Marty Feldman, 1933-1982).  Engaged to Elizabeth (Madeline Kahn, 1942-1999), Frederick has a beautiful assistant named Igna (Teri Garr).  When word spreads in the nearby town that a Frankenstein has returned to the castle, the townsfolk rally around their local police chief, Police Inspector Hans Wilhelm Friederich Kemp (Kenneth Mars) with his mechanical arm; but Frederick assures them that he is not planning to resume his grandfather's experiments--that is, until he discovers his grandfather's secret diary and decides that he too can create life!<br /><br />Filmed entirely in black and white, "Young Frankenstein" is a classic comedic film that continues to entertain both old and young alike.  With a combination of wonderful acting, hilarious accents (especially those used by Cloris Leachman, Teri Garr and Kenneth Mars) and the exquisitely written plot & dialog, it is unlikely that anyone watching this film will be able to do so with a straight face.  Some of the most hilarious scenes include Inga & Frederick with the secret revolving door, the laboratory scenes, the monster (Peter Boyle) with the old blind man (Gene Hackman), the duet between Frederick and monster singing "Puttin' on the Ritz", and Elizabeth transformed into the monster's bride (looking exactly like the bride from the original 1935 "Bride of Frankenstein").  Overall, I rate "Young Frankenstein" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and very highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

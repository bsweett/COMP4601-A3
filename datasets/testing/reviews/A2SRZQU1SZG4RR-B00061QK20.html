<meta name="summary" content="Stunning Visuals: A Film with Deep Meaning, Culture, History"></head><body><p>With indelible impressions of the subtle beauty and depth of "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon" and "House of Flying Daggers" still fresh on the mind, this viewer approached "Hero" with caution, anticipation and wonder ... could another WuXia film leave a similar impact? The answer is a joyful and reverberating  "Yes!" The special features section of the DVD is just as important to view as the film itself. It is important to understand how the film was born and came to life on the screen. First, the decision to include some of the best and most famous Asian actors and actresses is highly critical. The fact that it took almost 24 months to complete the screen play, which was written by the Director, Zhang Yimou along with Li Feng and Ang Bin is most amazing and unique. It is a joy to hear Zhang Yimou, the director explain his view point in writing this unique story, which is crucial to understanding the deeper aspects of human nature. The creative process comes alive and it is just as fascinating to hear and understand as viewing the stunning film and scenery of different locations in China ...<br /><br />The story line is subtle and simple: a Chinese swordsman is brought before the King of a province of China to explain how he managed to kill three assassins and arrive before the King within 10 paces of his throne. The king analyzes his story and through keen questioning, in a most legal and lawyer-like fashion, he dissects the truth. There is Confucious-like depth to the manner in which the story unfolds as the King is told the three different versions of the swordsman, Nameless's experiences.<br /><br />Each story has one of these colors associated with it: red, blue, or green. Different aspects of the story are emphasized with other visual artistic wonders, for example, leaves falling during a fight between Nameless and Snow. In the final scene our "Hero" b helps unite China for future generations. The meaning and depth of the story and visual cinematography are priceless and beyond word descriptions. One must view the film for total appreciation where words do indeed fail. Erika Borsos [pepper flower"</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Heartachingly beautiful film about love unfulfilled"></head><body><p>"Atonement" explores the theme of love unfulfilled. It starts of as a typical English drawing room comedy set in the relative calm of 1935 England - but storm clouds are gathering.<br /><br />Performances are uniformly excellent and the film, beautifully shot, has an almost dreamlike quality. There is an extraordinary extended shot that weaves along the Dunkirk foreshore. And the ending is heartachingly beautiful. This film is stunning achievement on a modest budget.</p></body></html>

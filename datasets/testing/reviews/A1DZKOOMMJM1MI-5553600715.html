That is the question haunting the audience through most of this elegant, sophisticated, and scary gothic thriller. The film, from Spanish filmmaker Alejandro Amenabar, takes the "old dark house" movie and reinvigorates it through intelligence and imagination. With its star, Nicole Kidman--at her enigmatic, beautiful best--the movie holds you in its clutches from the opening moment, when Kidman's troubled character awakens in bed with a terrifying scream, and doesn't let go until the final twist at the end.<p>The story takes place in the absolute seclusion of a stately, cavernous mansion on the fog-enshrouded Isle of Jersey, the southernmost of Britain's Channel Islands, in the days following the end of World War II. (the entire film was shot in Spain.) Grace (Kidman) lives here with her two young children. All are sadly aware that her husband and their father is not likely to return from the front. Three servants arrive to replace those who have inexplicably disappeared. Everyone tries to settle into a semblance of normalcy, but something is definitely not right. The children suffer from extreme photosensitivity whereby sunlight might kill them. So Grace darkens every room with heavy curtains, using only candles or fireplaces for light. Then, her daughter claims that she has seen and talked to "intruders." A deeply religious woman, Grace refuses to believe her "ghost" stories. Yet locked doors are discovered open, and a piano bursts into music without a player in sight. A strong sense of foreboding lodges in every shadow and mysterious noise. What caused the original servants to vanish so abruptly? What happened to Mom when she went "crazy" a few months ago? And why do the new servants, who claim to have worked at the house years before, exchange oblique references to impending "changes?"<p>Kidman, coifed and groomed so as to remind you somewhat of Grace Kelly, rules this nightmare with a steely determination to ward off any evil that might threaten her children. But her nerves are quietly going to pieces. Equally as formidable is Fionnula Flanagan's nanny, a strong, no-nonsense presence who also wishes to shelter the children from these intruders.<p>The youngsters are marvelous. Alakina Mann possesses a combination of curiosity and stubborn pride that makes her a constant thorn in her mother's side. James Bentley has large, bewildered eyes that swim in a pasty-white face, a perfect mirror of the audience's increasing anxiety at the super-natural incidents.<p>Elaine Cassidy's (her perormance being one of the few aspects of FELICIA's JOURNEY I actually enjoyed) mute servant girl and Eric Sykes' stolid gardener give the staff a commonplace touch at odds with their often strange demeanor.<p>Directing his own meticulously crafted screenplay, Amenabar manages to craft an intelligent and suspenseful psychological thriller, a rarity these days...</p></body></html>

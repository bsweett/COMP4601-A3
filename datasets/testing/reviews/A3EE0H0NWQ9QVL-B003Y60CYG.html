An all-star cast joins Garrison Keillor as they send off his celebrated thirty-year radio program.  Usually known for his keen folksy sensibilities, he is best at creating and telling funny and engaging stories from "Lake Woebegone," a fictitious town in Minnesota where "all the women are strong; the men are good looking; and the children are above average."  He throws out his best asset, but writes the story for the movie instead.  Guy Noir (Kevin Kline), a 40's era private eye, narrates his tale about his work, investigating as he moonlight's as a security guard for a `PHC'.  He seeks to find out the death of St. Paul's Fitzgerald Theater, while a `PHC' puts on its last show.  Fortunately, the delivery, while making the movie less interesting, is decent enough to avoid too much sentimentality or anger for the show's demise.  Unfortunately, some of the best acts are interrupted for the backstage development of the story.  Nevertheless, Woody Harrelson and John C. O'Reilly really deliver as the funny cowboys, Dusty and Lefty.  (Their rendition of a song called "Bad Jokes" showcases some of the best aspects of Keillor's final show.)  Similarly, the Johnson Sisters (Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin) also provide some key singing and comedy moments.  (Streep has a great Minnesota accent--as you might expect.)  Keillor, the man who brought great acts from unknown bluegrass bands to forgotten favorites (like the Everly Brothers) could have given himself a better sendoff, but at least he gave us a very professional cast.  If you liked `A Prairie Home Companion,' you will probably like the movie with a few reservations.  If you didn't like a `PHC,' don't bother.  At the end of the final show, young Lola Anderson (Lindsey Lohan) does a song, Keillor's fine gesture to extend the radio world to the next generation.  Perhaps the best part is at the beginning when a series of tuned-in radio broadcasts showcase the variety and influences Keillor drew from for his fine radio show.</p></body></html>

This movie was good...but it was very hard to follow, it jumped around a lot!! The action scenes were excellent and it did keep me in my seat and wanting to know what was going to happen next. Special Effects were great and the leading lady was a hotty!! If you are looking for a good...not great thriller...then rent this one!</p></body></html>

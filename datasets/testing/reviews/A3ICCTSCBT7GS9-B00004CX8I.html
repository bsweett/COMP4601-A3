He can play all of the movies, he is always good for any subject he find always the &quot;LONE&quot; of the strategy for &quot;pull part&quot; of the best of any situation in order to reveal the animal who sooze in himself ! He is very intelligent, JACK NICHOLSON and for this movie the price was costly, because he has visited... realy trues psychiatrics hospitals and he has been bound to leave his wife because he was totally in this strange role, he is therefore &quot;comedian&quot; his life has not importance when he play, his life is playing ! ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST THAT I'VE SEEN VERY much years ago is don't stil OVERTOPED ! 200% JACK NICHOLSON VERY GOOD ACTOR and all of the others actors who are plaid in this MOVIE are now KNOWN.... very much ! for exemple : The young who was stuttering or the other man who has plaid in BACK TO THE FUTURE CHRISTOPHER LLOYD MANY ACTORS ARE NOW KNOWNS</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Predictable but charming and it has a positive message"></head><body><p>This is a light romantic comedy with no big surprises.  What's special about it is its really fine acting, its excellent sense of comedy and, most of all, its positive message.  It starts out with a 13-year old girl who wants to be popular.  She's had a cruel joke played on her and she takes it out on her male friend who adores her.  She wishes she were "30 and flirty" just like the women in the fashion magazines.  And with some incredible "wishing dust" - there she is.<p> <p>Flash forward 17 years.  Now, our heroine, played by Jennifer Garner, is 30.  By some magic formula that only Hollywood can understand, she has forgotten the past 17 years and is, in fact, a child in an adult's body.  Not only that, but she has an important job at the very fashion magazine that fired her imagination when she was 13.  And her co-worker and rival is the very same nasty girl who created havoc for her as a teenager.<br /> <p>With the help of her overweight and motherly secretary (who is a fine character actress but whose name is not even listed in the credits), she looks up her old guy-pal who she treated so badly so many years ago, played by Mark Ruffalo.  He's now a photographer and also engaged to be married. Naturally, the plot thickens.<p> <p>The film moves at a rather frantic pace and I found myself laughing out loud.  How it all turns out is predictable but charming.  And the message is that past mistakes can be corrected and everyone can live happily ever after.  Recommended for all, but particularly recommended for romantic comedy fans.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable film"></head><body><p>This is a rather creative and fun film which showed scariness without relying on monsters, werewolves, or serial killers. Rather, it focuses on the scariest thing of them all - Death. How do you escape Death once he has his sights on you? How do you escape a force which no walls, key, or lock can bar away? Well... you could try to outsmart him, and that is exactly what this group of young people try to do when one of them has a premonition which saves his friends from an accident which they were destined to die (hence the title of this movie, which serves as a non-dirty double etendre)<br /><br />Overall a creative and imaginative horror movie which eventually spawned a whole series of sequels, but you simply cannot go wrong with the original Final Destination. A must-see!!!</p></body></html>

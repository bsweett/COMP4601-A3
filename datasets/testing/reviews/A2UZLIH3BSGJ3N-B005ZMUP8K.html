Well,I can wait,no sense in rushing a good thing, and Disney knows when it has a good thing going and does everything in their power to capitalize on it. The film itself tops  the first by bringing to light some of the other mysteries of the original. For instance,Jack's  mysterious compass that only he can make sense of and how he came about comandering the Black Pearl.Two small pieces of information, but very big puzzel pieces to say the least are brought in. There were just as many, if not more laughs in this one. The new sequel picks up shortly where it left off. Jack pilaging and stealing with Will Turner not too far behind. A new villian comes into the plot(Lord Beckett) wanting one thing of Jack's that he keeps with him at all times and talks Will into obtaining it from Jack,i.e-the compass in order to pardon Will and Elizabeth for past crimes (real and imagined).Jack himself has his own problems, the compass isn't working like its suppose to, and low and behold is visited by a ghost of his past and warned,"It's done Jack,he comes for you now" meaning the very real and feared Davey Jones.This immediately sends Jack into a panicked frenzy to run the Pearl to the shallows and onto land in order to avoid the Kraeken,a mythical sea creature that is more real than many people know.Eventually Will finds Jack and the two conspire(yet withhold vital details from one another)and work out a deal. Jack wants the key to Davey Jone's box, where the real treasure is and he talks Will into getting it. Will soon finds himself onboard the Flying Dutchman with Davey Jones at the helm and soon meets his very dead,yet alive father cursed into 100 years of servatude aboard the Dutchman.He learns of some secrets and again is brought to light of truths he was not aware of. Will eventually finds a means of escaping Davey Jones along with his very protected key, and the hunt is on. Davey Jones will stop at nothing to retrieve the key and tirelessly persues The Black Pearl while Jack is on the run/hunt for the box to which it opens. Ultimately the Pearl is corned and Davey Jones sicks the Kraeken on it eventually pulling it back to the dark crushing depths of the ocean and Jack along with it. The end leaves you hang'in and panting for the third film and I can't wait to see what they do next. This film has wonderful humor and even more action than the first topped with the fantastical special effects that ILM is know for producing. Fortunately the CGI effects do not get in the way of the story,characters or slow the film down,and that much I am greatful for because it could easily be spoiled. This is well worth owning and making a fine addition to any film fan collection.I highly reccomend it and is great fun for the whole family.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Potter grows up"></head><body><p>The fifth Harry Potter film sets the stage for war.  Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is on the loose, although certain parties in the Ministry of Magic would have the public believe otherwise by publicly accusing Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) of lying about his return.  When the detestable Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) takes over Hogwarts, stripping the curriculum of practical spells, and Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) seems to turn his back on Harry, the angry young man takes it on himself to train his friends for the coming conflict.<br /><br />Radcliffe turns in his best performance to date in the least of the Potter films.  I haven't read the book yet, but perhaps it was a mistake to make the longest book to this point into the shortest film.  The screenplay often seems to race from development to development and the huge cast has become positively unwieldy, with many incredible actors reduced to brief, unsatisfying walk-ons.  However, it was still very entertaining and its awkward nature is perhaps inevitable; like "The Empire Strikes Back," the whole film essentially serves as a prelude to much bigger events to come.  The earlier films were far more successful at maintaining their own independent identities.  At any rate, it makes me eager to see what comes next.</p></body></html>

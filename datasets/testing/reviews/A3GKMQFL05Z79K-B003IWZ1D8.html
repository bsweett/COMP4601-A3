It was based on the book, Psycho, which was written by Robert Bloch. The book was loosely based on Wisconsin Serial Killer Ed Gein. The film tells the story about a secretary that embezzles money from her employer. She goes on the run after doing so yet, because of weather & fatigue, decides to stop by The Bates Motel. Yet, her stop there proves to be her undoing. Out of all of Alfred Hitchcock's movies, this is the movie he is most fondly remembered for. The movie stars Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh(mother of Scream Queen Legend, Jamie Lee Curtis), Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam, & John Mcintire. The Shower scene in the movie has been studied and discussed over and over as to why it is so terrifying and why many has tried to copy it through the years. This collector's edition includes extras like newsreel footage surrounding the making and release of the movie; an archive of production stills; the special trailer in which Hitchcock himself leads viewers around the Bates place; credit designer Saul Bass's original "shower scene" story boards; posters and advertising materials for the movie's William Castle-like publicity campaign (No One Will Be Seated After the Feature Begins!); and, the piece de resistance, a 90-minute documentary on the making of the film!<br />The movie itself was so succesful that it spawned three sequels(one of which was directed by Perkins himself), a made-for TV movie called The Bates Motel, and a remake that stars Anne Heche-Vince Vaughn-William H. Macy-Viggo Mortensen(of Lord of the Rings fame)-& Julianne Moore. The movie was also the very first movie to start the 'Slasher' Genre of movies.<br /><br />This movie is a classic that deserves to be in any film lovers' collection.</p></body></html>

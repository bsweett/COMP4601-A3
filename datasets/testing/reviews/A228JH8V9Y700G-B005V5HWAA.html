<meta name="summary" content="Post Waterworld"></head><body><p>Since the disasterous failure of Waterworld in the late 90s, Kevin Costner retreated to more modest projects.  Truth be told, I picked this up at the video store the other night and decided to give it a whirl.  It's ten years after Waterworld, and I was a bit disappointed to see that Kevin Costner's acting skills have not changed.  Still, this was a good movie.<br /><br />Kevin Costner is Mr. Brooks, a white collar Oregon businessman who seems to have everything - a successful business, wealth, a wonderful wife, etc.  He is hiding a dark secret, unknown to all.  He is a serial killer known locally as the Thumbprint Killer.  William Hurt is his alter ego, the little devil on his shoulder who is egging him on to give into his urges and invisable to all.  He's resisted temptation (in physical form of Hurt) for two years, but one night he gives into his urges and kills again.<br /><br />It's hard to read into this too deeply, because the story eventually becomes convoluted and a little too hoaky.  Demi Moore is the ambicious policewoman after him, dealing with her own personal issues (the cheating husband she is slugging it out in divorce court with, her boss, her father, etc.).  A man across the street from the house where Mr.Books murders a couple just happens to be taking pictures and attempts to blackmail Mr.Brooks into teaching him how to.  Mr.Brook's daughter returns from college, announcing that she is dropping out and clearly hiding something from her family.  Here Mr.Brooks attempts to play several roles.  He is the father trying to make everything alright for his daughter; but, I guess if your father is a serial killer and you as the child have inherited his need to kill, the only solution is to kill someone else at the college and lead the police investigation someplace else.  When Mr.Smith chooses someone to kill, you know who he chooses is going to somehow interlock with the rest of the story.  And the circumstances about Demi Moore's father issues are just a rip off of Clarice Starling (just like every movie with a female cop has been since).<br /><br />It is a good movie.  It makes some valid points about addiction and how people are willing to do anything and everything to satisfy their wants.  Still, it was a little too complicated and a little too hoaky to be considered very good.</p></body></html>

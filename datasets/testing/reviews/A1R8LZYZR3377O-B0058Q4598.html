<meta name="summary" content="Had sooooo much potential!"></head><body><p>The original for its time was interesting and just a great little sci-fi. Eons have passed as it pertains to a remake so I can not really make a fair comparison between the two films. I will judge this film on its own merits.#1. Had this not been a remake you would not see an alien that looks like Gort in a modern film. #2. Somebody watched the 80s film Starman too many times(which was very good). Think about this and you will see multiple liftings. #3. Kathy Bates was at her worst and detracted from the film as did the step child who could not act period. #4. The alien spacecraft was I guess cool looking but very disappointing. A floating orb that shows up like Glendas descent in the Wizard of Oz (minus the advancement)didnt require much thought and left me cluless as  to alien travel.. #5. Could these beings have been studying us all this time and deside to suddenly visit us to only realize that,"we are at our best when at a precipice?" #6. Keanu Reeves was good but didnt have enough screen time to elaborate on the cosmos, science, etc. #7. The film was fun to watch and had some good moments that unfotunately left you wondering why more alien concepts were not explored. #8. The scenes from the interogation to the lie detector were great. #9. Jennifer Connely was excellent. Her and Reeves were a good choice for this type of film. Their scenes held the film together. #10. One scene of Gort walking was not enough.  Besides desolving into a destructive metal parasite I wanted to see shear brute force against the puny Earthlings.#11. Overall, not solid. It is good to see a good old Earth vs. them film though.</p></body></html>

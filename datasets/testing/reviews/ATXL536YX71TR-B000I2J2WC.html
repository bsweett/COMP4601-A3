<meta name="summary" content="Oh stop the arguing...this film never lets up!DA VINCI CODE"></head><body><p>We all saw it I am sure.We all read the book.We all heard the silly arguing and controversies. I saw it three times in the theatre and now this outstanding 2 disc widescreen DA VINCI CODE excites me even more.This is the only 175 minute film, other than TITANIC and AMADEUS where I don't get up to pee!<br /><br />Yeah, the book and the film are absolutely dizzying with all of the characters,history,fact,fiction,churches,riddles etc.etc.etc...but as a former theology student,I find this film and it's possibilities compellingly presented and with a pulsating Hans Zimmer soundtrack that just relentlessly pushes this enigma wrapped in a mystery forward from one car chase, to another near fatal escape that Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou find themselves.<br /><br />Thirty years ago, I learned all of these "theories" about Christ and Christianity while in school.Was Jesus married to Mary Magdalene? Was there a bloodline that traces to Scotland? Did and does The Catholic Church have a "secret order" to suppress this information? Was Leonardo Da Vinci one who knew and believed this information? I still don't understand the hubbub about this film.It's a film...and if you are secure in WHATEVER you do or don't believe,as the Greek writer Aristophanes reminds us in his FROGS,"It's only a play!".DA VINCI CODE is an exciting,yes long, flick...and if you like to be held in a state of suspense,learn a little (no...a lot) of history along the way all done to a fantastic soundtrack,go DA VINCI CODE.Empty your bladder before viewing!</p></body></html>

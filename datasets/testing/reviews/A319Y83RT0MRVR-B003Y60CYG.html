<meta name="summary" content="couldn't finish watching it because I fell asleep of boredom"></head><body><p>Sometimes Robert Altman's ensemble dramas are spectacular (Gosford Park), sometimes they are the best medicine for the sleep-deprived (Dr. T and the Women). Unfortunately, this movie is the latter. Despite the wonderful cast, this movie drags on and on. About an hour into it, I zonked out. Maybe, I'll go back to it and finish watching it, but if I do, it's only due to the respect I have for the actors. I'll admit that I might be lacking the necessary background to see the movie (having never heard the radio show); still, what kind of movie limits it's audience to only the baby boomers and excludes everyone else?</p></body></html>

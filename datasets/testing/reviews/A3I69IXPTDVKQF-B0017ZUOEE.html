When the now-adult Laura (Bel&eacute;n Rueda) returns (along with her husband and their young son Simon) to the closed-down sprawling manor that once served as an orphanage where she spent a short part of her youth, she hopes to re-open it and turn it into a more home-y and loving place for orphans, a place less austere and gloomy than where she spent part of her own childhood.  Things don't go as planned though.<br /><br />After Laura left the orphanage, a string of tragedies occurred there, most of which are not widely known and talked about, and some of which remain completely unsolved.  And ramifications of this dark past reach into the present - before the orphanage can even be re-opened - and result in the disappearance of Laura's son Simon, who before going missing has become convinced of the reality of his 'imaginary friend'.  The search for the missing Simon goes through the normal channels - police investigations and such - but in order to really find out what happened Laura's going to have to learn more about the true history of the orphanage, things she never guessed at at during her short stay there as a little girl.<br /><br />  The gorgeous Spanish seaside, an eye to visual detail, an array of subtle little touches in the background and undertext, and great cinematography all help to make The Orphanahge what it is, a movie that, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPA6">Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H7J9R6">Dark Water [Blu-ray</a>] and the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009S54WC">The Eye</a>, mixes and contrasts terror and darkness with beauty and tenderness, all to tremendous effect.  It's worth noting that The Orphanage walks a path different from traditional ghost stories in that, while the ghosts can be (and are) scary, the ghost can just as often be a sympathetic character and much of the fearsomeness can come from the living instead of solely from the supernatural.  The Eye (and to a lesser extent, its remake) was like that too, where both spirit and mortal can be either good or malevolent, or often some strange (and tragic) combination thereof.<br /><br />The only possible shortcoming of The Orphanage will be that those who dislike ambiguous storylines and endings may not be fully satisfied.  It doesn't always tell you what certain events and implications mean, and you're left to figure some things out yourself.  I don't mind this kind of thing at all, and for me this was one of the best ghost stories ever told.  A must-see for horror fans, and even non-horror fans who like mystery and the supernatural (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783233477">Meet Joe Black</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IXXYBA">Ghost</a>) should check this one out as soon as possible.

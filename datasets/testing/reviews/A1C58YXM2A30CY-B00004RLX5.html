<meta name="summary" content="There Be Whales Here!"></head><body><p>Star Trek IV takes a bit of the last film and a bit from the first one.  We have alien invasion, an environmental message about the destruction of whales as a species and Man as well.  We learn a lot more about Spock (as he becomes re-educated after his ordeal on the Genesis planet, last film) and time travel!<br /><br />Lots of fun lines in this one.  Only whales can communicate with a probe that sucks energy from anything in its vicinity and proceeds to evaporate the Earth's oceans.  The problem is that there are no more whales.  The Enterprise zips into the past (in a dubious fling around the sun -- as an aside, whenever some sci-fi films deal with time travel, they will go into the past by going the opposite direction of a rotating star or planet, ala Superman, but I digress), in an attempt to get whales from the past and bring them into their present.<br /><br />Trouble is, the Enterprise crew is on the lam, having stolen a Klingon ship (from an earlier film).  What to do?<br /><br />So they sail into 1986 San Francisco where the area is as alien as any galactic planet they've ever been to.  We hear Kirk with his double-damn on you in crossing a street, Spock giving a nerve pinch to a boom box Goth kid (the theater audience I watched the film with cheered at that) and trying to figure out what exact change means.<br /><br />San Francisco treats like landing in Golden Gate Park ("don't forget where we parked"), the fictional whale institute in Sausalito (and our enjoyable one and only visit with the biological scientist Catherine Hicks) and Chekov's discovery of the "nuclear wessels."<br /><br />Directed by Leonard Nimoy, and story by Nimoy and Bennett.<br /><br />Has the charm and humor of the old TV series.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

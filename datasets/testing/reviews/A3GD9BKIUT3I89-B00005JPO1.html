Sean Connery was 53 the last time he played Bond and Roger Moore was 57.  They both looked too old for the part.  Ford is 65.  The last guy to punch out bad guys at a similar age was John Wayne.  There are some nice touches : bring back Karen Allen, acknowledging the passing of Denholm Elliot.  Rosewell?  Crystal Skulls? Worth having as part of an overall Indy collection.  It's better than the three turds Lucas calls his chapters I-III of STAR WARS saga.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Get dumb?"></head><body><p>From all the negative reviews of this movie, you'd think the title was "Get Dumb!" But as a long time fan of the original, I enjoyed it. I thought the movie stayed close enough to the original concept and that the actors were all good enough so that the movie was an overall enjoyable flick.<br /><br />Ann Hathaway and Steve Carrell aren't quite as wacky as the originals, but then who is? Don Adams had a quality of goofy exaperatedness which is hard to imitate, but Carrell is still good in his own inimitable way. I thought they both did a decent job with their roles. Terrence Stamp, Bill Murray, and Alan Arkin, were all good as I would expect, and The Rock was better than I expected and in some ways stole the show.<br /><br />The movie reprises many gags from the original, such as the cone of silence, the shoe/radio, the line "Missed it by that much!" and few others, and I thought those came off well too. Overall, I thought this was, although perhaps not great, still a good reprisal of the original show for an old, somewhat persnickety fan of the original series.</p></body></html>

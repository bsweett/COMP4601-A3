<meta name="summary" content="Goth and Gore Galore"></head><body><p>The Wolfman stays true to the old fashioned look and story of the original, but this time it's in color and we get folks being ripped apart piece by piece. The level of gore caught me be surprise. I knew there would be some to earn it's R rating, but limbs and heads leaving bodies and sailing through the air had my full gorehound attention. Rick Baker is still the man when it comes to creature makeup. He kept the original look from the 1941 version, only he added enough changes to make it far more menacing. Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving are all in cruise mode here. None of them turn in a bad performance, but nothing memorable either. Still, the acting is fairly solid all around. The set design and cinematography add plenty of gothic vibe to establish a nice eerie mood. Most of the scares are the cheesy kind, you know, where something jumps out of nowhere and makes a loud noise. There is a good mixture of practical effecs and CGI (some good, some average), but I'm glad they kept the CGI to a minimum. The werewolf transformations are very good here and look painful. Francis Ford Coppola had a much better take on an old monster classic when he made Bram Stoker's Dracula back in 1992, but Joe "Jurassic Park III" Johnston did a better job than I thought he would in resurrecting this beast for modern audiences. It comes across well as an old fashioned horror tale, but with huge doses of animalistic violence and bloodletting, leaving no doubt that this is The Wolfman you shouldn't pet, but fear.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></body></html>

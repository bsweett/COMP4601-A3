<meta name="summary" content="DIRTY, GRIMY, FILTHY AND ORIGINAL"></head><body><p>As a fan of the horror genre who reads a lot of industry magazines, I had read a great deal about this film long before it even hit theatres.  It eventually turned out to be a far different film that I ever thought, being far more of a psychological thriller than the crazed, serial/slasher film that it seemed to be advertised as being.<br /><br />Saw opens with two men, Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) being held captive in a dingy, grimy, foul, and mold infested bathroom.  The bathroom from hell, literally.  They are both chained by the ankle to pipes at opposite ends of the bathroom, neither one knowing how they got there or why.  Between them lies a corpse, dead of a self-inflicted gunshot to the head.  They each find a micro-cassette in their pocket as a voice ridicules them as to the reason they are held captive.  Gordon is told he must kill Adam by 6:00 or his wife and child will be killed.  They also find two hacksaws...too weak to cut through their chains, Gordon realizes they are for cutting through their own ankles if the want to be free.<br /><br />Through flashbacks told by Gordon, we learn of a maniac called the Jigsaw killer.  He plays a deadly game with people, putting them in horrific traps with a small chance of escape where they usually end up killing themselves.  But who is he and why is he doing this?  We learn that Gordon himself was a suspect and investigated by detectives including Tapp (Danny Glover).  Tapp eventually is dismissed from the force when he becomes obsessed with Gordon after his partner is killed by the Jigsaw Killer.<br /><br />Saw is a heavy-handed thriller/horror.  The killer has his warped, moralistic reasons for doing what he does such as trapping a prostitute in a mask that will rip her face apart unless she locates the key for the trap inside the stomach of a corpse.  The Killer seemingly goes after victims who don't have a greater appreciation for life and this does somewhat give away a major plot surprise as James Wan simply was not subtle enough to handle it more deftly.<br /><br />Elwes and Whannell give fine performances as the two men driven to the edge of sanity by their ordeal and one wishes that more time was spent building the tension between the two, rather than with so many flashback scenes.  It is in this dark, dank cell where the movie is at it's best.  Being in a place like this would make anyone cringe and run screaming.  Being held captive there would be one's own private hell.<br /><br />If SaW is guilty of one thing it's perhaps that it tries to be a little to clever for its own good.  It tries to throw a few too many curve balls at viewers to throw them off the track but in doing so, allows one to basically eliminate every character from suspicion out of general principle.  And of course there's little doubt that the film was made with the idea of a sequel already planned.<br /><br />An effective thriller, more for the mood and settings than for the actual plot, but a well done effort.</p></body></html>

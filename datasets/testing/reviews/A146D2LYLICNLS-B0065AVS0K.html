<meta name="summary" content="Skinny little Nancy Callahan. She grew up, she filled out..."></head><body><p>...oh, DID SHE EVER. Truer words have never been spoken. It should be illegal to have curves like that. Someday I will make Jessica Alba mine. Ok, I had to get that off my chest.<br /><br />I'll first say that I have never read a "Sin City" book. I've certainly heard of it, but it has never appealed to me (no disrespect to any long-time fans). But I heard enough about this movie to become interested, especially because of the visuals. After seeing it yesterday, I can safely say that one does NOT have to be familiar with the books in order to like this film. I found myself fascinated throughout the whole movie by the excellent visuals, as I was when watching "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" although it has to be said that "Sky Captain" was mainly for the kiddies in terms of the level of violence, whereas "Sin City" is a far cry from being kid-friendly.<br /><br />Which brings me to the violence in this film. Yes, it is brutal and graphic. However, there are two things which keep the violence level below the in-your-face, sick-to-your-stomach level that it was in movies like "Kill Bill." For one, virtually all of "Sin City" is in black & white. So the blood isn't realistic-looking. In fact it looks like white CGI in most scenes. Even the most graphically violent scenes such as the quadruple amputation and the beheadings have a certain "cartoonish" look to them, which of course is the entire point of this movie. And the second reason why the violence isn't so shocking is because a lot of it is pure tongue-in-cheek. When you have people basically act as if nothing has happened after their hand gets sliced off or after an arrow goes through their torso, you know it isn't supposed to be taken seriously. But again, that's all part of the fun of "Sin City."<br /><br />In terms of acting, I have no complaints. And I certainly have no complaints about the female eye-candy either, especially Rosario Dawson and (you guessed it) Jessica Alba. Although all women are either hookers and/or strippers, they're capable of kicking serious a$$ and using their blades to the serious misfortune of anyone who crosses them.<br /><br />I had a lot of fun with this movie and would recommend it with no reservations. In terms of visuals alone, it is pure brilliance. It is stylish, well-paced, well-directed, and as cliche as it sounds, just plain *cool*. Don't wait for DVD-see this movie on the BIG SCREEN.</p></body></html>

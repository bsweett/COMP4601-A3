<meta name="summary" content="Stunning!"></head><body><p>I was just going to write a review of United 93 praising the work of Paul Greengrass in presenting this story with great intelligence and sensitivity.  His choices throughout the film are exceptionally astute and the film is gripping, terrifying and sad.  There is a feeling of numbing dread in the early scenes of the passengers boarding the flight alongside the hijackers that is excruciating.  Normal people, going about their lives, unaware of the terror we know is about to befall them.<br /><br />As I said, I applaud the choices the film-makers have made, and this is a fine film that should be seen by many.  I found it stunning.<br /><br />I likewise find stunning several of the jaw-dropping one star reviews I have just read here, motivated by and pumped full of their ridiculous and absurd conspiracy theories.  I was equally dismayed to see how many positive votes this rubbish has received.  Not only are these mental cases ill-informed, but their insensitivity to the families of the people who died on this flight in spewing their deranged crackpot views into this public forum is beyond bad taste.  I imagine they are likewise,  beyond shame.</p></body></html>

I gave up on this movie the first time, but then a friend told me that I needed to stay with it because it got better.  She lied.  I didn't find anything about this movie either thrilling or suspenseful.  The ending was a little too pact and yet again in a George Clooney movie ( ex. Syriana) I never come to care about the characters.  Well, maybe poor Arthur.  Clooney does turn in an average performance, but the movie is dull regardless.</p></body></html>

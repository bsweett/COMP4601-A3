<meta name="summary" content="Love It"></head><body><p>This is a beautiful, touching, and sad movie. It touched my heart!!!! I love watching this movie over and over again. They did a GREAT job on Charlize Theron make up. She looked just like the real Aileen Wuornos. She acted just like her too. She did a great job on telling Aileen's story. This is a must see movie.<br /><br />I also believer if you enjoy this movie you need to also watch/buy Aileen Wuornos: The selling of a serial Killer. The 1992 interview. I also have this movie and I always watch it before or after watching Monster. The selling of a serial killer is about Aileen's life.... of course. But it is sad hearing about the people in her life wanting to make money off of her. People clamming they love her are trying to talk her into killing her self while she is locked up. It is heart breaking hearing her girlfriend turning her back on Aileen. There is also an interview with her so you can her the truth coming out of her mouth only. Not someone else. These two movies are a must buy.</p></body></html>

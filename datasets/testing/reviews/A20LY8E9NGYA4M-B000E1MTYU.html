<meta name="summary" content="ARNOLD + PRETTY WOMEN + INCREDIBLE EFFECTS = GOOD SEQUEL."></head><body><p>After a 12 year absence, a Terminator movie is around. One more time Arnold Schwarzenegger repeats his signature role, and despite this time the director of the first two movies James Cameron, the actress Linda Hamilton and the actor Edward Furlong didn't came back for T3, there's new blood on the series.<br /><br /> In &quot;Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines&quot;, there is a new Terminator model, the T-X (Terminatrix), played by the gorgeous Kristanna Loken, who does a good job as a cold and precise cybernetic killer. Also there is a new John Connor, actor Nick Stahl. On this movie John Connor loses a lot of the personality that Edward Furlong printed to the character in &quot;Terminator 2: Judgement Day&quot;. However, the pretty Claire Danes fills the hole left by the &quot;new&quot; John Connor, Claire plays Kate, a brave woman that refuses to let the humanity to be destroyed.<br /><br /> The visual effects and the audio effects are incredible. The highlight is a vehicle chase scene, which is jaw-dropping. Despite T3 doesn't have the same depth of the first two movies, is a very enjoyable film and a worthy sequel.</p></body></html>

Well, that was me, seeing Vertigo for the first time.  Pure awe.  I, of course, being a film fan, had heard people laud this as Hitchcock's best film.  But I would scoff and say "pshaw" go back and watch The Lady Vanishes again, or Shadow of a Doubt.<p>I really had no idea what I was missing.<p>This is a fascinating film.  Not only because of the surprises thrown at you, but also because of the performances.  Jimmy Stewart is cast against type (although he is still the everyman we identify with) as a man obsessed with a woman he fell in love with, and then lost to a bizarre suicide.  Kim Novak is perfect as well in her dual role as the suicidal woman and her lookalike that Stewart sees walking along the street some days after and takes up with.<p>If you haven't seen it, I won't say any more, so as not to ruin the twists and surprises.  I will say, however, that if you like Hitchcock, you should definitely add this one to your list.  <p>If you are renting it, make sure to get the Widescreen version.  It does make a difference.</p></body></html>

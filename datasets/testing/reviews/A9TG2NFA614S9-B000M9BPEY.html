<meta name="summary" content="Tim Burton and His Visual Fantasies"></head><body><p>In Big Fish (2003)--what if you think your daddy has told you nothing but tall tales which you prefer to call lies? A son thinks his father is a blowhard who can't be honest with him. Edward Bloom (Albert Finney in a kind of Southern accent) loves to tell stories that he perhaps embellishes and exaggerates, but maybe not that much. There may be more than a kernel of truth in those tales. But, at any rate, this causes a rift and separation between the father and his son William Bloom (played by Billy Crudup, a frequent Broadway player). The senior Edward Bloom as a youth is played by Ewan McGregor. He's a winning actor you can't help liking because of his smile and his openness. As a youngster Edward Bloom saw his death in a witch's eye.<br /> The movie is part fantasy and part realism. Along the way there are monsters, giants, man-wolves, a witch, an enormous catfish, a phantom town, and other amazing sights.<br />Danny De Vito plays a circus ringmaster, Steve Buscemi plays one of Bloom's neighbors who is living in a dreamlike utopian town, and Helena Bonham Carter plays a witch and a woman who is in love with Will. Jessica Lang plays Finney's adoring wife.<br /> The movie creates a pleasant mood, a fairy tale-like atmosphere. It has an upbeat ending, and I don't know why exactly but the movie reminded me of Forrest Gump; this film has that same kind of romantic and sentimental flavor.<br /> It was directed by Tim Burton who often deals in fantasies and oddball stuff. He's provided some eccentric roles for Johnny Depp. This is a satisfying, pleasant movie. Just don't take it too seriously, and you'll have fun with it.<br /> Filmmakers like Burton have a unique opportunity through their medium to present imagery that is bizarre, over-the-top, surreal, dreamlike visuals. He sometimes goes further than necessary as in "Alice in Wonderland," But this movie combines just enough fantasy with the everyday to make it a lighthearted  experience.</p></body></html>

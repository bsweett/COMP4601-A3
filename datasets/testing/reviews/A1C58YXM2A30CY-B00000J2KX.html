The boy Danny has special abilities:  a secret friend inhabiting him (which is not satisfactorily explained) and the ability to hear others' thoughts (the Shining).  But buildings can have shinings too.  Homicidal rages from a formerly easy going author (typing nonstop pages of "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" is hilarious) taking orders from the ghosts and supernatural beings that in habit the hotel.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UJ48SG">2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>) is known for his almost maniacal style in doing take after take.  Shelly Duvall had the most number of takes ever, I read.<br /><br />The movie does have its chilling, insane moments.  I enjoyed the boy's horror but was not sure if it was "Tony" his imaginary friend talking or Danny himself.  The ending is thoughtful but a bit of a let-down (the 1921 photo).<br /><br />Overall, not a shabby movie. But really, how did Jack get out of that locked refrigerator?  Hmm?<br /><br />The "making of" was shot by Vivian Kubrick, and you really get into the heads of the cast and what they were thinking as shooting progressed.<br /><br />Other Kubrick Flix:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UJCAKO">Stanley Kubrick: Warner Home Video Directors Series (2001 A Space Odyssey / A Clockwork Orange / Eyes Wide Shut unrated / Full Metal Jacket / The Shining / A Life in Pictures)</a></p></body></html>

The ones with all the cut outs on a single sheet of mylar....No matter how many times you used it, you were fortunate to be able to create the same images over and over again.<br /><br />That's why the director has done with this and his other films...<br /><br />Lady in the Water follows basically the same template as "Signs"<br /><br />"The Village" and "Unbreakable" are basically the same as "The Sixth Sense". All of these films are so very similar to each other that it is impossible to really get excited about any of them and his propensity for delivering films using this same template dillutes the very fine film that was The Sixth Sense (although to be honest it was really an homage to many films from the 1940's).<br /><br />Ronnie Howard's daughter is some sort of a water nymph who has to find someone in this world to save her in order to conquer some sort of gobbeldy gook of a creature made of grass. In order to do so, the apartment manager to whom she reveals herself must gather a group of people together to fight this evil. Confused? Don't worry, you'll be bored.<br /><br />There are several false endings and in the end there's not a whole lot of satisfaction in having stayed through the end. The characters are just that. They aren't fully believable - and in some cases, some are downright offensive in their stereotypes.<br /><br />Really not worth bothering.</p></body></html>

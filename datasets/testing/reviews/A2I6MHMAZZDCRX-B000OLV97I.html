These warriors and their dragons brought peace and prosperity to the land for many years.  But one of them, Galbatorix (John Malkovich), wanted all the power for himself.  He betrayed and killed the others and became king of the land.  As is always the case in these tales, he rules with an iron fist and is hated by all.<br /><br />Eragon (Ed Speleers) is a young man in the kingdom.  This seventeen year old is content to farm his uncle's land.  One day, while out hunting, he finds a weird stone.  He takes it home, and it hatches.  He now has a baby dragon on his hands.<br /><br />The dragon grows quickly, and Eragon learns that he is a dragon rider.  He is a fulfillment of prophecy and the last hope of the resistance to defeat Galbatorix.  He learns this from Brom (Jeremy Irons), a man from his village who tries to teach him a little about his new life while taking him to safety with the rebels.  Will they survive the perilous journey?<br /><br />First, what worked.  The acting was great.  The scenery was fantastic, and the special effects were awesome.  The dragon looked so real.  I'm seriously considering reading the books to see just what happens next.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the actors and special effects teams were working with a very weak script.  Part of that is the basic stories fault.  Based on a book by the same name, the story feels like Star Wars with bits of other fantasy novels thrown in.  Of course, most of these "original" stories borrowed heavily from what came before them, so it's not like that in and of itself is a crime.<br /><br />The bigger problem is the length.  I feel like there is story missing from the movie.  Eragon learns magic overnight and we never see him bond with his dragon.  What I thought to be plot threads were introduced then lead nowhere.  I realize they were trying to keep the running time down since the movie is aimed at kids, but I think they could have found some other way to trim the time.<br /><br />Speaking of kids, they may or may not like the movie.  There is death, scary creatures, sorcery, and a rather intense battle at the end.  Parents will have to make this judgment call on their own.<br /><br />Any movie that makes me want to read the book can't be all bad.  However, the script seriously weakens a story we've seen in other forms before.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dark Wizards! ** minor spoilers **"></head><body><p>Part I of the Deathly Hallows is faithful to the book for the most part.  Although a few things were cut out (such as the evil werewolf Greyback with the Snatchers or cutting out the Harry/Lupin fight in favor of a cute tent dancing scene with Hermione) the overall spirit of the film was faithful to the book.<br /><br />Director David Yates I feel did not make a great film with Order of the Phoenix but clearly redeemed himself in my eyes with this film.<br /><br />The film felt rushed at first. In the book there was more build-up with Uncle Vernon.  On the other hand, Harry's contemplation of the little stairway closet he used to live in, you can almost hear him say "Wow, I've come a long way."<br /><br />And indeed he has.  He wants no one to be hurt or injured and would rather go off on his trek on his own.  But Ron and Hermione will have none of it. and go Disapparating all over the English countryside with the Death Eaters hot on his tail.<br /><br />Several scenes they got right:  Ron's anger and jealousy with Harry and Hermione.  The Patronus doe to the lake where the sword of Gryffindor is laid.  The snake attack at Bagshot's place.<br /><br />And most amazingly, the great animation of the Three Brothers tale, as told by Hermione (and interrupted by Ron a couple times)!<br /><br />Nitpicking Follows!<br /><br />Several things I would have liked to have seen:  More of the elf Kreecher and his explanation of Regulus Black's switching of the Horcrux at the lake introduced in the previous film.  And in the book, Harry's disguised self at the Ministry of Magic enabled him to free many people from the dungeons of the Ministry but that didn't happen here.  And more of the radio -- there was a lot more going on with the radio broadcasts {Potter Watch}, like a Radio Free Wizard or something!<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />I can see a person not having read the book might have some trouble with parts of the screenplay.  Reading the book clearly helps in filling in the gaps.  The snappy dialogue and the deep emotional investment by the audience is wrenching.  But the occasional humor (the tent scene) was cute.  And the soundtrack by the London Symphony Orchestra was superb.<br /><br />It's going to be a long wait to this summer!</p></body></html>

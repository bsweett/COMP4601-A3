Especially for a film not in English.<br /><br />I'm sure the plot has been explaining in most of the other 600 reviews for it here.<br /><br />Never had I felt so much hate for a fictional character before. Sergi L&oacute;pez playing the Captain had me begging for someone to put an end to his monstrous cold-heartedness. To try and explain such a movie to someone as being something like Alice In Wonderland in Nazi Germany can easily be dismissed as a brain dead idea, but I am glad to have seen the movie now and seen one of the best movies of the new millennium.<br /><br />Never have I felt absolute hate; and wanting a character to get it in the end so badly, then I did with Sergi L&oacute;pez character. So I guess my hat has to go off for his performance creating such a powerful and villainy of a fictional entity.</p></body></html>

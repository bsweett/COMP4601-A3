This is a fair specimen of bulk entertainment.<br /><br />It has all the right pieces. There's the pair of happy go lucky ex-military buddies, out to make a few bucks, have a few laughs, and save the world. There's the pair of WHO doctors, out to track down a mysterious disease and to save the world. (The requisite babe is one of the doctors.) There's the evil business man, out to make a few bucks even if it destroys the entire Atlantic ocean.<br /><br />Did I mention credibility? No? There's a reason for that. If you can believe a gunboat from the American civil war in the middle of the Sahara, you'll get along with this movie just fine. You might even believe that the gun still works. If you don't look too closely, it's just a good guns'n'chases eco-fable where everyone keeps their clothes on. You could do worse. In fact, if you're considering this movie, you probably have done worse.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

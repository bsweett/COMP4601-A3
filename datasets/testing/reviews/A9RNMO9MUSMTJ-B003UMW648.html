<meta name="summary" content="The Saga continues...the quality remains"></head><body><p>After enjoying the first movie, i was also pleased with the second movie.<br />  Many new characters are introduced and the movie feels like a fresh<br />new movie and not a retread of the first one.  The sets, the music and<br />the special effects are first rate, and its nice to see mass armies<br />on the battlefields again ready to do battle for good or evil.<br />I was entertained and cant wait for the next chapter....<br />A keeper</p></body></html>

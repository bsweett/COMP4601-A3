Not everyone accepts Morpheus' (Lawrence Fishburne) belief that Neo (Keanu Reeves) is the key to their salvation, so the crew of the Nebuchanezzar (spelling?) are on their own (in the beginning, anyway) as they reinsert themselves into the Matrix in search of Neo's final destiny.<br /><br />Pay no attention to the nay-sayers.  This film is lots of fun.  I enjoyed the pseudo-philosophical speechifying on the nature of reality between spectacular CGI-loaded [scenes].  The Wachowski brothers have taken a lot of trouble to flesh out the world of the Matrix and polish it with a veneer of intellectual significance.  You can think about it exactly as much as you want to; I'm sure the Wachowskis had something coherent in mind when they were writing all those speeches, and repeated viewing may bring clarity.  Or you can just sit back and enjoy the ground-breaking special effects sequences with the sound turned way up./</p></body></html>

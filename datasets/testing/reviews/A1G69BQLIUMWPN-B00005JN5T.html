<meta name="summary" content="You should Meet The Fockers."></head><body><p>This movie was so funny that I think it passes the first one.  And that is rare.  I felt the dry humor and jokes that were geared towards sex were pulled off well.  They were made funny because "The Fockers"  really are dense and don't realize that they are being crude.  So it makes for a funny fim.  I also loved the baby in the movie he was so cute.  But my favorite part was the end when everyone realized that they could get along and were finally one happy family.  You can tell there will be a third movie since this one has done so well.  Let's up hope that it lives up to these first two movies.</p></body></html>

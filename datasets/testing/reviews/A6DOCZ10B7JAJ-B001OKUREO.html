It shows you a glimpse of his party life in college, his pathetic attempts at sustaining a "real" job, and his incessant family afflictions.<br /><br />But W avoids being too political, much like Dubya did himself.  Although it comes off at times as somewhat critical of the president, it also avoids much of the controversial and significant moments in his presidency.  Like the doubts surrounding the election, the speech to rally public support for the War on Terror, and the inexcusable reactions to Katrina.  By dodging these topics, it leaves you feeling disappointed and manipulated.  Another well-made but ambiguous version of the truth by Oliver Stone.</p></body></html>

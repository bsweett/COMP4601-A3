The reviews are for those editions not the newer deluxe editions.<br /><br />This installment marks the first film with Jason getting his trademark hockey mask. This film is gorier than the first two films and has a slicker look. The 3-D effect is more of a distraction than anything else, but the film is better than the second and more intense than the first.<br /><br />The DVD transfer looks good and there are some cool extras on the box set.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Remake of "Candidate" undone"></head><body><p>Despite a great cast headed by Denzil Washington,Meryl Streep & Jon Voight, this remake is extremely disappointing. Washington is excellent but changing the plot and making the chief character to be a politician drains the film of whatever suspense and tension the original did have.  Demme is no John Frankenheimer, his direction is competent but plodding and I found myself waiting for this film to end rather than being tied up in knots as I did with the original. Washington may be a better actor than Sinatra yet the original contains proof that Frank was a fine film actor (also check out "Man with the Golden Arm" to verify this!)and he delivers.  Rent the original and give this one a pass.</p></body></html>

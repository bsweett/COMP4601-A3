THIS MOVIE GOT A BUM RAP FROM CRITICS!"></head><body><p>OK, I was really skeptical going into this film but, good reviews from my Amazon friends Geri and Jenny made me give it a chance. This film is not going to win any Oscars but, I don't think it was trying. This is an entertaining and easy to watch film with good performances by a lot of well known stars. It's a nice family film that isn't too sappy or corny. This film took a beating by critics and I say you reviewers need to loosen your belt buckles and take your shoes off sometimes! How can you be so mean to such a well meaning film? It's certainly worth a watch or two. It's not too "wild" but, it's stars like to "hog" the screen! LOL! whatever that means!?........I need a vacation!</p></body></html>

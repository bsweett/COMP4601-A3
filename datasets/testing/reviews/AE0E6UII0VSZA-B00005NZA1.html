<meta name="summary" content="Shyamalan creates a terrific hero"></head><body><p>You wake up in a rather murky setting. The stretcher beneath you creaks under your weight as you raise yourself into a sitting position. The curtains around you are mostly closed, leaving an opening the size of a small door. On the other side, you see a man lying on a hospital bed, completely wrapped in bandages, and there is a growing spot of red that tells you the man is hemorrhaging. He is about to die. Everything is kind of fuzzy, but you know that you and the dying man were both victims of the same train wreck, but while he is wrapped up like a mummy and quickly approaching death, you look at yourself, and there isn't a scratch on you. <p>The idea of something like this happening prompts a series of thoughts to streak through your mind, and each of these thoughts is captured in director M. Night Shyamalan's follow up to his masterful &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;: &quot;Unbreakable.&quot; And I think I have to answer one question before I really dig into the guts of this review: No, this one isn't as good as &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; but it's still ridiculously good.<p>&quot;Unbreakable&quot; examines a world of possibilities that is very similar to comic books. If someone like Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) exists in the world with the horrific disease of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (a genetic disorder that makes bones very easy to break), then the logic of a comic book reading mind would deduce that there must be someone at the opposite end of the spectrum. Someone whose bones are unbreakable. Someone who doesn't get sick. Someone whose destiny is to utilize his or her powers to protect the rest of us.<p>Elijah (a biblical reference to one who would pave the way for a savior) Price believes that he has found his opposite when a train crash outside Philadelphia kills everyone on board except for one man, who escapes totally unharmed. That man is David Dunn (Bruce Willis, with the double-sounding hero name like Peter Parker or Clark Kent), an ex-college football star who now works as a security guard at the local football stadium. One day, after the train wreck, David finds a note held under the windshield wiper of his car, and in it is scrawled a question that starts the true meaning of the film coming into focus: "How many days of your life have you ever been sick?" David makes it his mission to find out, and he makes some incredible discoveries along the way.<p>M. Night Shyamalan does not disappoint his followers with this film. Sure, the film has its implausible moments, but that is more than forgivable, not just because of the believability of the Willis character, but because this film is, in essence, the first comic book movie that wasn't based on a comic book. The cinematography is outstanding, giving this movie the look and feel of those impossibilities that we love seeing in comics. Shyamalan shows he is quite an established shot-maker, the best I've seen since Spielberg and Sam Raimi, and he uses his music (composed by Maestro James Newton Howard) to accent every scene perfectly. And it wouldn't be an M. Night Shyamalan film without a surprise ending and some really clever sequences.<p>&quot;Unbreakable&quot; is an uncommonly absorbing film that gripped me from beginning to end. The visual style is incredible, the characters are believable, and the acting is stellar. The ending, I thought, was rather tacked on, but nevertheless effective: It doesn't cheat. If I had to pick one movie star to be a superhero, it would be Bruce Willis. Why? Because he never fails to be cool in every single movie he does.</p></body></html>

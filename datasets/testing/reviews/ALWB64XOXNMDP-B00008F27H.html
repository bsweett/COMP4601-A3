I was glad they added the sound effects of the old bridge to bring a sense of continnuty to the new ship. <p>I was very dissapointed all the Memory Wall footage was not shown. I wanted to see the sets. They just showed an actor on a wire going down a movie set which looked like a wall from the entity. Then there was a pass with no sound with the costume coming towards the camera. There were so many photos I have seen of that deleted scene that at least I wanted to see the other portions of the set. Wise was right in his decision to remove it. It did look like they were on wires. <p>The case is another dissapointment. The plastic disk holder falls out if you don't open it correctly. It's like a two page disk container and you can lose the disk very easily if you are not careful. Since my Star Trek Motion Picture disk is going to get lots of repeated viewings I am going to switch the case from my Star Wars Episode one disk. The Episode One Disk plastic case won't fall apart like this one did.<p>Other than that along with the dissapointing Memory Wall footage, it was a decent package. We finally get to see what V'Jer looks like without the clouds surrounding it. If it were up to me I would have added a scene that shows the exterior and massive size of the craft in comparison to the Enterprise. I was so surprised to see this thing had an actual shape. It looked like an alien ship out of Babylon Five. With Foundation Imageing ....the guys who did the CGI on B5 working on this...it's only natural.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Unbelievable"></head><body><p>This movie was ridiculous. Willis' character is more like Superman, Batman, Wolverine and The Hulk all rolled into one. He is inhuman and more like his character in Unbreakable than the origional character in Die Hard.<br /><br />The movie is so full of unbelievable action and stunts that it just seems like the director and writer were trying to take you on a roller coaster ride just for the the hell of it. The story is stupid and the dialogue is horrible.<br /><br />The could have called this Die Hard 4 Cannot Die So What Is The Point.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""America Was Born in the Streets.""></head><body><p>In New York City in 1846, a child witnesses the violent death of his father in a gang battle between the Irish immigrant "Dead Rabbits" and the "Natives" who want the power in the city to stay with those who were born American. Ten years later, Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo diCaprio) is a young man determined to avenge the death of his father years ago. He returns to lower Manhattan's "5 Points" neighborhood in search of Bill "The Butcher" Cutting (Daniel Day Lewis), the Native warlord who killed his father and still holds sway over the 5 Points. Amsterdam's intelligence and courage attract Bill's attention, and Bill invites him into the Natives' inner circle. There Amsterdam falls in love with a professional thief named Jenny (Cameron Diaz) who enjoys Bill's protection. As the years pass, the nation becomes embroiled in War, Tammany Hall's Boss Tweed seeks Bill Cutting's help to win support in the 5 points, and Amsterdam becomes a sort of surrogate son to Bill. Eventually, Amsterdam's identity is betrayed to Bill and he is forced into hiding. But Amsterdam is able to raise an army of Irishmen to challenge the Natives' power.  In 1863, the new "Dead Rabbits" and the "Natives" do battle again as Draft Riots sweep the city and New York erupts in violence and flames.<br /><br />"Gangs of New York " will probably not go down in history as one of Scorsese's masterpieces. But I really appreciate what director Martin Scorsese is trying to do in this film. "Gangs of New York"'s story of love and revenge is a little corny. But the substance of this film is found in the environment in which the characters live: The 5 Points, New York City, circa 1860. The film's theme is bold. And so you won't miss it, as it's stated in the movie's tagline:  "America Was Born in the Streets." This nation's framework was laid in documents, with signatures, and in civil -and uncivil- debate, by wigged gentlemen in wood-paneled chambers. But the nation itself was forged in cauldrons of hate, greed, chaos, and extreme violence. And it continues to be today, as our culture  makes this nation what it is, not our lawmakers. Daniel Day Lewis gives a great performance as cunning, sociopathic, seductive Bill Cutting. Lewis has never been slimier. Jim Broadbent, as Boss Tweed, has all of the best lines in the movie and is a lot of fun to watch. If you have lived in New York City, or perhaps any city, you may recognize the roots of the city's modern politics and public services in this film. And it may make you chuckle at how little some things have changed. "Gangs of New York" is a worthwhile and entertaining lesson in social history. Note that the film is very violent and not for the squeamish.</p></body></html>

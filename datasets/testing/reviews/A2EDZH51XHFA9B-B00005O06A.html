You can mix and match them in any way you like, from any country in the world and from any period of time after World War II. Ask them what the best movie ever made is. While there are very few things about which film critics agree, this is one of them: the choice by the overwhelming majority of your mix-and-match set of film critics will be Citizen Kane. (The website They Shoot Pictures, Don't They? actually does this, except with, as I write this, 1,365 critics. I don't need to tell you what the outcome is, do I?) That said, faced with actually seeing a film so widely regarded as the best ever made, the average Goat is going to have one of two reactions: either "hey, wow, they're right!" or "what's all the hype about?"<br /><br />Well, I'm your average Goat. And I have to say, I can see what all the hype is about, as long as I turn my head and squint just right. I like Pauline Kael's quote about it: "it's the most fun you'll ever have watching a great movie." Now there's a sentiment I can get behind.<br /><br />Welles' masterpiece is great not just because of the movie itself-- which Welles wrote, produced, and directed at the tender age of twenty-six (by contrast, Muranu was thirty-four when he directed Nosferatu, Romero twenty-nine at the time of Night of the Living Dead, Riefenstahl thirty-three at the time of Triumph des Willens)-- but because of the politics surrounding it. I won't even begin to attempt to get into that here; the American Experience documentary The Battle Over Citizen Kane (thoughtfully included with the 2005 Warner two-disc set) is longer than the film itself. See The Battle Over Citizen Kane soon after seeing the movie itself to get some perspective.<br /><br />Note: here be spoilers. I assume the majority of those reading this, even those who haven't seen the film, already know the whole "Rosebud" shtick, but I'll warn you about spoilers anyway.<br /><br />The plot: a media tycoon, Charles Foster Kane (Welles), dies of old age. His last word: "Rosebud." A newsreel crew working on a ten-minute film of his life wants to find out what he meant, and the rest of the film is members of the crew talking to Kane's friends and intimates, trying to track down the meaning of that word. They never do. Through the omniscience of the camera, we find out that "Rosebud" was the name of the sled Kane had as a child growing up poor in Wyoming, and that no one else will ever know this; the sled itself is burned by junk dealers as the closing credits roll.<br /><br />Now, here's the thing. The legions of folks who say "it's just a sled!" missed the entire point, and that's how Welles sets the whole thing up. Everything from the early scene of Welles in Wyoming (in which, of course, Rosebud plays a minor role) to the final moment of the film is a red herring. Which leads you to one of two conclusions: either the mystery is secondary to Kane's life in Welles' vision, or Welles would go to any length to pull a fast one. (I lean towards the second hypothesis.) It's a fun red herring, to be sure; after the screening of the newsreel itself, which takes up the first ten minutes of Citizen Kane (and they are the slowest in the movie), it rollocks and bounces along making just as much fun of itself as it does of the larger-than-life Charles Foster Kane. And it does make fun of Kane; why else would they portray a media tycoon longing, on his deathbed, for his penniless existence in the middle of nowhere? But the claws are always at least covered in velvet; it's an affectionate sort of savagery, if such a thing is possible. No one the film crew talks to is overly fond of Kane, and some outright hate him; all, however, are forced to admit to at least grudging respect for the man. Now, think about that for a moment (and think about the fact that Welles himself is playing the object of all this scorn); there's a whole lot of emotional layering going on here. Solid stuff for a twenty-six-year-old kid.<br /><br />Welles had a grand vision for this movie, and, given complete freedom by the studio, he realized it. He did, in fact, make a great movie. Even with all the perspective, all the historical facts, all the mulling it over for weeks and realizing the depth of the script coupled with the incredible acting talent, pitch-perfect production, etc., though, I'm not even sure it's my favorite Welles movie. (I have a soft spot for The Stranger, the Welles that never pops up on anyone's thousand-best list, much less hundred-best.) Yes, it's a fantastic piece of work, an absolute must-see, a thoroughly enjoyable ride through the mind of one of the finest directors to ever work inside (or outside) the Hollywood machine. And it's possible that no movie ever made could live up to the hype to which this one has been subjected. It's genius, yes. But the best movie ever made? See it, and decide for yourself. **** ?</p></body></html>

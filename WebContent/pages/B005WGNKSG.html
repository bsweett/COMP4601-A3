Swedish title 'M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor', from the original novel by Stieg Larsson, 2009, 135 minutes) was quite the wild ride - and not for the faint of heart. This Swedish instant classic is, like all Swedish film, unashamed about showing truth as realistically as possible. Yet I must confess that with all I have seen in life, I wonder whether I'll be able to sleep tonight after seeing this. It is THAT good.<br /><br />An intrepid Goth-girl-computer-hacker, Lizbeth Salander (exquisitely played by No'omi Rapace) becomes far too interested in a prominent journalist, Mikael (Michael Nyqvist), who gets sued for libel and sentenced to 3 months' jail time. He has a while before that sentence is to begin, and in that interim he is contacted by a benevolent old man. This man wants to find out what happened to his 'adopted' daughter (really his niece) - who vanished in the 1960s. The old man wants the journalist to discover what may have happened, and there is an immediately stated suspicion that this girl is dead.<br /><br />That much I leave there, but I have some observations about this. With all the undoubtedly over-hyped fuss regarding the recent British remake of this, and with the original novels, I can say I came blindly into this. Luckily I stumbled onto the DVD after having said "Pass" when it was on cable. Americans take, remake and just spoil the heck out of all these excellent films. Especially the Swedish ones. This series should have been left to the Swedes. I don't see any Brit or American dopes trying to remake CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON!<br /><br />This is an important film. The Goth girl, with a dragon tattoo that wreathes her entire body, is a new kind of superhero. She's been a victim but never 'played' the victim. She's gotten her revenge from the time she was a child. She has a photographic memory that is part of her arsenal and a set of cojones that made me green with envy. Her brains and investigative prowess made me greener. You will be stunned at the world's cruelty to her; you will be equally stunned by the strong message in this story: too many people hate women just for being women.<br /><br />There is much more in this rich, exciting film. Swedes are catching us up in America, and soon will be outdoing us on a regular basis. My feeling is they are only stopped by their economic woes. Once their money and political problems blow over, I hope to see hundreds of films as wonderful, chilling and educational as THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO. I look forward to seeing THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE ("Flickan som lekte med elden"), which holds the rest of Lizbeth's story - and the third film, THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST ("Luftslottet som spr&auml;ngdes"), all of which are 2009 Swedish films, shot back-to-back as one film.<br /><br />In the excellent extra on my DVD, No'omi talks about working on these films for over a year, doing nothing else during that time. Sadly, the DVD extras are extremely paltry.<br /><br />The latter two movies are, of course, also slated to be filmed and released in British versions, by way of Columbia Pictures. I'll live without those, thank you, having learnt my lesson long ago about these sub-par remakes.<br /><br />I have two good pieces of advice: watch this dubbed (it is excellent and there will be migraines galore if you try to follow subtitles); avoid the books if you have not read them (I believe in film as solid literature in and of itself). Also, be aware this is is NOT for the faint of heart and not for children. In my opinion, not even for teens.<br /><br />One star is deducted for all the far-too-realistic gruesomeness and the sex, which I found distracting, gratuitous and frankly weakening to the crime drama.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P98DMX8YUSNW.html">A1P98DMX8YUSNW</a><br/><p>I came at this unburdened by having read the book, so the movie stood on its own. I found far too many easy coincidences, such as the ridiculous number of preserved photo negatives from a 1966 parade in a nowhere town in Sweden that allow the disgraced journo and his punk g-friend to solve a 40-year-old murder. And the convenient stacks of 1960s Vander Co. business records, containing just the right clues, were another absurdity for me. I appreciated the hint at such a multi-layered mystery, but in the end I was not convinced by the reality. This could not have happened in real life, so I was not transported. It's also hard to see how someone could disappear to Australia and never be found until just the right moment. The leading man here is not much of an actor, either. He is semi-expressionless throughout, as is the girl of the title. Others find her performance great. I just thought it was one-dimensional. All the computer hocus-pocus seems unreal as well. not to mention the get-even finale which also depends on an absurd amount of written records all coming together thanks to the "genius" girl researcher. This is still entertaining, but deeply flawed.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is, all at once, a taut and suspenseful action thriller, and an interesting study of human nature.<br /><br />A writer for Sweden's number one magazine, Mikael Blomkvist of Millennium, is facing a hefty fee of 150,000 kronor and a sentence to time in jail for slander and libel. Before his jail time is to happen, he gets a letter from Henrik Vanger, the head of a wealthy family. A man of 80, his niece had disappeared 40 years ago and was never found. He writes to Mikael asking him to help solve her mystery, and in turn, will help him out with the pickle he's in. So he moves to Hedestad, an island 3 hours away from Stockholm to get started on his work.<br /><br />A tattooed and pierced computer hacker named Lisbeth Salander has been following Mikael's case for quite some time. Lisbeth has Aspergers (or some sort of autism). She's sexy, but she's troubled- she's had a troubled childhood being in and out of behavioural centres. However, fate, or so it seems, leads Mikael to Lisbeth, where they both work together to solve this amazing case.<br /><br />This very film is why we go to the movies. At 152 minutes, your interest is held. It is a long movie, but the length is the last thing on your mind when watching it. Dragon Tattoo manages to keep you entertained, it immerses you in these awesome characters. They become your friends for 2 and a half hours, and the whole time you feel like you're solving the mystery with them.<br /><br />This film is full of suspense, and for its entire duration I was on the edge of my seat. Michael Nyqvist is just GREAT as Mikael, and everyone else is great, but the real highlight is Noomi Rapace. She is one of the most gorgeous and talented actresses out there right now. It struck me how so different she is in real life too- in this movie, she just IS Lisbeth. She is more than just a pretty face, she is an amazing actress, and it's such a shame that there aren't many actresses like her nowadays.<br /><br />In short, do not miss this flick. Even if you don't like foreign movies, do see this film. It is one of the greatest movies I've had the good fortune to see at the cinema, and a film that just improves with repeat viewings.</p></br><a href="../users/A25KKXUQQ0OLWB.html">A25KKXUQQ0OLWB</a><br/><p>I wasn't the biggest fan of the book but enjoyed The Girl Who Played with Fire much better.  This film starts slowly but had me hooked by the end.  The actors whom I have never heard of before are excellent in their portrayals of the characters.  I highly recommend this film and found it enjoyable by the end.  There is a lot of violence in the middle so hang on, everything ends.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FFPPPIOSI36M.html">A1FFPPPIOSI36M</a><br/><p>There are umpteen reviews of this movie so I won't further discuss  the plot in detail.<br /><br />This is a magnificent, richly detailed and emotionally moving film that offers a tremendous reward for those who stick with it and experience the climax. It's many related stories woven into one. This is not a movie to watch a bit at a time but rather, if you want to enjoy the emotion of the story,  you must be involved throughout the duration of the flick<br /><br />There's a lot going on here. You have the woes of the title character, Lisbeth who is an abused ward of the State.You have an investigative trail pursued by a publicly defamed journalist, Michael. You have the reputation and exploits of Michael's small, investigative newspaper. You have debilitating secrets exposed of an aristocratic family and you have a fantastic disappearance mystery.<br /><br />The story is told in a slow moving yet highly absorbing manner. As the plot furthers, the mystery and eerie atmosphere steadily develops. The director does a very effective job by creating suspense through the prolonged use of old black and white photographs. During multiple times, there is simply the closeup of 40 year old portrait of the subject of the disappearance which is utilized in an effectively, spooky manner.<br /><br />This is a Swedish film with subtitles. The subtitles actually enhance the mysterious effect of the movie. It makes the viewer pay close attention to the dialog and excises any unwanted, unnecesary chatter. Part of the haunting charm of the movie involves the old world, European aura of many of the characters so the lack of English fosters this aspect perfectly (I cannot imagine this film being remade, which it is, by Hollywood, since I feel that taking away this "European" aura will take away what makes the film so interesting).<br /><br />Although there is action in the film, that is not what makes the film so good. The quality in the movie is not so much in the visual but rather in the quality of the story, the character development, and how it all resolves itself.<br /><br />This film gets better with repeated viewing since there is a lot to absorb. This is a fresh alternative to the mainstream.<br /><br />P.S. The other 2 films "The Girl who played with Fire" and "The Girl who kicked the Hornets Nest" are not merely sequels, they pick up EXACTLY where the preceding films end... although the three films are quite different from each other. To see one of the films before the other would be a mistake since each is predicated upon the earlier one. This film is a mystery, "Fire" acts as a "James Bond" like, spy piece and "Hornets Nest" is a courtroom drama. Each film is good but this first one is by far the best since it is quite an effective mystery.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>I thoroughly loved Stieg Larsson's MEN WHO HATE WOMEN, but feared a movie version of it would probably be butchered. I am thrilled that this was not the case. THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is an excellent adaptation, and Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth is eerily accurate in her portrayal as a brilliant, somewhat naive, vulnerable, computer-hacker with a haunted past, and a core that's stronger than steel. The direction, cinematography, and overall acting is top-drawer as well. In fact, Michael Nyqvist as a rail-roaded journalist is nearly as good as Rapace. Of course, a few people will be put off by actually having to read subtitles, but after watching Rapace's performance I can't really picture anyone else as Larsson's heroine ( Hollywood, has to try though... ).<br /><br />There is plenty of suspense, a superb plot, and a pretty satisfying conclusion in this first movie in the series. This is not a movie for kids. There is nudity, and more than a bit of torture, with some gruesome murder thrown in.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>My initial resistance to this film was it's length and the subtitles.  Once this superb thriller sinks it's claws into you those concerns go out with the bathwater.  This film works on two levels.  Primarily as a labarynthine mystery surrounding the disappearance of a sixteen year old girl in 1966.  Secondly it's a character study of the film's title character, Elsbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace).  As layers of Salander's past are revealed her mystique multiplies.  I haven't seen the other two films in the trilogy but after seeing Rapace's account of Salander I'm salivating at the mouth.  Currently they're prepping American versions of Stieg Larrson's novels from which these films are based.  That brings to my mind "La Femme Nikita" and it's lame American photocopy, "Point of No Return".  I hope when they translate these works for U.S. audiences they bring a little inspiration to the table and not money grubbing cynicism.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo or as it was originally titled, Millennium: Part 1: Men Who Hate Women is a very dark movie in the style of "Silence of the Lambs" and "Seven." It also has a lot in common with the excellent book Place of Execution by Val McDermid and its very good TV adaptation, especially in the part that deals with the investigation of the old disappearance case of a 16 years old girl. It is interesting that David Fincher who had made"Seven," is working on the American re-make of the tattooed girl already, even though the Swedish film was released less than a year ago. The film is good, not great but certainly very watchable and it is the most interesting when Noomi Raspace's Lisbeth Salander takes the screen. This is a character with obviously something so horrifying in her past that had changed her forever and altered her life in many ways. Lisbeth is a a Computer hacker of highest class and she helps to the popular but fallen on the hard times financial journalist Mikael Blomqvist who faces the jail time for the lost libel case against the powerful industrialist to solve the cold case of the mysterious disappearance of Harriet Vanger. The beautiful and sweet 16 year old girl from a wealthy and influential family disappeared without a trace 40 years ago, and her uncle, 82 year old Henrik Vanger the owner of Vanger Corporation, wants Mikael to take a closer look at the case. The film is long, 152 minutes, but is quite watchable due to good pacing, interesting story, and one of the most fascinating, complex and enigmatic characters that I've seen in the movies in long time. Must warn you that the movie fits its original title Men Who hate The Women and contains several scenes of violence toward women and equally brutal but in my opinion and in the opinion of my 80 years old mother and my husband highly justified but difficult to watch revenge scene. As it is well known, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the adaptation of the first book in the phenomenally successful Millennium trilogy by a Swedish journalist Stieg Larsson, published after his sudden and untimely death. Larsson wrote the books for his pleasure, and decided to offer them for publication shortly before his death. Larsen called the first novel Men who hated women, but it was released in English as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.<br /><br />Millennium trilogy is one of the world's best sellers. Three novels were translated to over 40 languages and sold 27 million copies. Larsson stated that the main source of inspiration in create the character of Lisbeth, was Sweden's most beloved heroine of children literature, Pippi Long Stocking by Astrid Lindgren. I would add Pippi the survivor of nightmarish horrible childhood ... I have not read the books yet but I most certainly will and I will be waiting for the rest of the movies' release. I am intrigued by Lisbeth's dark sides as much as her brilliant intellect and her personality. She is the best part of the film and I want to learn more about her.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", a book by Stieg Larsson, that I greatly enjoyed and reviewed for Amazon, has spawned a movie version that is extremely well done and is a very faithful rendering of the book. It's in Swedish with English subtitles. If you haven't read the book, the film is a standalone, a very clear film which doesn't require a reading of the novel. It's a very intense, gripping movie that, I think, is going to grab and hold you.<br /> Magazine owner and investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist, has been found guilty of libeling a big industrial magnate and is sentenced to three months in prison. He has to take a leave from his magazine, and while he's waiting to serve his sentence, he is hired by wealthy industrialist Henrik Vanger to find out who in his family murdered his niece, Harriet Vanger, forty years before. Some of the Vanger family, a mean and nasty bunch, live on a private island with him.<br /> Mikael moves to the island and later joins forces in the investigation with the tattooed girl. The girl of the title, Lisbeth Salender is very strange with piercings on her face, and she wears very severe-looking tight-fitting jeans and jacket. Her make-up is stark, and she seems menacing and creepy as well as beautiful. She's a computer hacker who investigates cases for a security agency. She can get information that few others can dig up. The investigative techniques and the research procedures are handled very well in this movie. It's fascinating to watch her and Mikael delve into family secrets. Some members of the Vanger family were Nazi sympathizers.<br />The violent, torture and s and m scenes in this movie are almost unbearable to watch, so beware. This is definitely not a movie for the kiddies. Mikael gets deeply involved in the investigation and at one point, he gets shot. Serial killings, mutilations, and serious cases of abuse come up during the probing, and devastating family secrets are brought to light. Flashbacks add to the suspense.<br />The acting in the film is excellent, and the cinematography is outstanding with some sweeping views of the austere Swedish landscape.<br />The book and its two sequels have become international bestsellers, and this movie has been a considerable hit in the world market. Two movie sequels are due soon. It's fitting that the original title of this book was "Men Who Hate Women." Lisbeth is a victim who knows how to mete out vengeance.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>This is a fantastic adaptation of Stieg Larsson's novel. The casting is perfect, the acting is superb, and although several elements of the book were altered for the film, it really stays true to the heart of the story. None of the disturbing and violent aspects of the book were toned down for the movie, which surprised and pleased me. The only mild complaint I have is that because so much material from the book obviously needed to be cut for the 2.5 hour film, many of the characters barely get any screen time. For example, I think Erika only appears briefly in two scenes, and her relationship with Mikael isn't even acknowledged in the film, which is a huge disappointment. Also, many members of the Vanger family, including Martin and Isabella, only appear very briefly in the film. While I understand the need for it to be that way in order to keep the movie at an average length, it does detract from the whole mystery of the Vanger family and doesn't give the audience much of an opportunity to analyze the suspects in detail. Overall, though, I really enjoyed this movie very much and look forward to watching the other two installments in the trilogy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>Stieg Larsson is known in Sweden for his contribution to sci-fi fandom but to the outside world, he is known posthumously for his "Millennium" trilogy especially with the novel "M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor (Men who hate women)" aka "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo", the first novel of the trilogy and a novel based on manuscripts by Larsson written  but unpublished until after his death in 2004.<br /><br />In 2008, Larsson became the second best-selling author in the world and the trilogy had sold 27 million copies in more than 40 countries.<br /><br />In 2009, the film received its Swedish adaptation and the film which was created for $13 million would go on to earn $102 million worldwide and now a US version based on the novel has been greenlighted and currently, casting for the film is now being done in the US.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" looks very good on DVD.  The cinematography by Jens Fischer and Eric Kress is well-done.  The various shots throughout Sweden during the various scenes of daylight, night, snow and heavy rain was well-captured.  I didn't notice any compression artifacts or any major PQ problems.  Personally, I was impressed by the cinematography that I actually am looking forward in picking this film up on Blu-ray and watching it via HD.  It's a stunning film that the director and cinematographers really did a wonderful job in bringing Stieg Larsson's novel to life.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is presented in Swedish Dolby Digital 5.1 and an English 5.1 Dolby Digital dub.  I watched the film in its original Swedish presentation with English subtitles and the audio is very well-done.  Great use of crowd and hardware ambiance, music and various action scenes that utilize the surround channels.  Audio is clear and understandable and I actually would have love to hear the lossless soundtrack for this film on Blu-ray.  But people who are curious about the Swedish track should know that it is clear.<br /><br />As for the English dub, I prefer not too watch dubs but my wife does and I watched a little bit with the English dialogue and its well done.  The good news is that the dub track is not by American's trying to be Swedish which is good news and that the dub actors due have a slight accent.<br /><br />But for both audio tracks, we vouch for the audio tracks that we listened to.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  * Interview with Noomi Rapace - (12:30) An English interview with actress Noomi Rapace (who plays Lisabeth) who talks about playing the role of Lisbeth and enjoying the original novel and what preparation was done to transform to the character of Liabeth and the pressures she felt in playing this major role.<br />  * Theatrical Trailer - (1:43) The English dubbed theatrical trailer for "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo".<br />  * The Vanger Family Tree - A graphic showing the Vanger Family Tree.<br />  * TGWPWF Preview - (1:25) An English preview of the second film in the "Millennium" trilogy, "The Girl Who Played With Fire".<br />  * Previews - Music Box Film Trailers<br /><br />JUDGMENT FILM:<br /><br />My first foray into "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" came from my wife.  Her family members have loved the novels and my wife was going crazy reading all three novels and then watching the film.  She has told me many times to read the novels in the trilogy but with so many books in my reading queue, I figured, why not see what the hype is all about and watch this film for myself.<br /><br />And as I watched "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", I was drawn in by the performances of Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace.  Their performance was magnificent, as was the cinematography by Jens Fishcer and Eric Kress.  Just the amount of footage shot in various weather conditions and locations was quite impressive but most of all, bringing the novel to life (as my wife would say).<br /><br />This film was not only suspenseful but it literally sent chills down my spine.  The film is not for the weak at heart when it comes to violence and torture.  The film has many graphic moments of people who have been murdered, people who have been raped and I'm not going to sugarcoat things... this film is violent.<br /><br />But the film is also a suspenseful, haunting thriller that not only grabs your attention, you literally root for these characters that are completely opposite but they take you on an amazing ride with quite a bit of twists and turns along the way.  I have no problems saying that "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is one of the best modern suspense films that I have watched in long while.  And I'm talking about overall acting, cinematography, pacing and how well the story is conceived.  It's a fantastic film!<br /><br />So far, a lot of the reviews haven been quite positive for this film.  Those who have read the novel have had positive feelings while some have a hard time with the casting choices.<br /><br />Duane Dudek of the Journal Sentinel writes, "The lead character, a crusading journalist, looks older and seems duller, and the title character, an anti-social computer hacker wearing a spiked dog collar and black lipstick, seems as if she belongs in a vampire movie. And the story that was so compelling on the page, about the disappearance of a teenage girl 40 years earlier, feels simplified and literal."<br /><br />Personally, these characters are what I loved about the film.  The character of Mikael Blomkvist is an experienced writer who is taking on a billionare and now having to face a serious libel charge that he libeled him due to false information he was given.  I just don't see this part going to a younger talent.  Considering the US version has hired 007 actor Daniel Craig to play Blomkvist, the more seasoned writer than is very astute, observational and wise made Michael Nyqvist perfect for the role.  And Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth was a wonderful casting choice.  To see her as an anti-social, goth-like computer hacker brought another dimension to this film.  I literally can't picture anyone but someone from the underground and also different from the norm in playing the role.<br /><br />Since I haven't read the novel, I don't know how much detail was left out but for the most part, this is one of the few instances where I felt the longer duration has helped the film (where so many filmmakers abuse the longer duration for a film and sometimes lose sight of what made their film so entertaining with banal scenes).  Personally, I didn't feel the story was simplified but having read a variety of those who felt it was a solid adaptation and others who felt that the book was better, it's all subjective.<br /><br />If there was one subject that I feel may touch a nerve with viewers is a rape scene (well, actually there are others who have been raped and tortured) but there is one graphic scene that may turn people off.  I for one, dislike disturbing scenes like this in a film especially if was done for shock value.  In the case of "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", although a film that contains a lot of violence, I felt that the violence was not gratuitous and was appropriate to the story but again, this is subjective as I've read those who felt it was appropriate and others who felt it was bit too much for their taste.<br /><br />As for the DVD, the DVD doesn't come with a lot of special features but the interview with Noomi Rapace was quite interesting to watch and see how she dealt with playing the character and seeing how the public had felt about her performance.  Also, it was cool to see the trailer for the second film which I really look forward too. But I wish there was an audio commentary track, featurette and more interviews.<br /><br />Personally, as much as I enjoyed the DVD version, I now want the Blu-ray version.  The cinematography was just great as was the audio that I want to watch this movie in HD and also hear it in lossless audio.  If you are debating between both Blu-ray and DVD, I'll tell you right now, go with the Blu-ray version because a movie this good, demands to be seen on Blu!<br /><br />"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is a fantastic film featuring an awesome performance by the talent, a chilling screenplay adaptation and wonderful cinematography and music.  It's a film that will no doubt send shivers towards your spine but you will feel that you are captured by the film by the solid performances courtesy of Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace.  These two were absolutely wonderful.  I know there is a US version coming out soon but personally, the Swedish film was done exceptionally well and both the Blu-ray and the DVD comes with the Swedish and dubbed English soundtrack.  But I just hope that the US version of "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" doesn't become another film that joins the list of horrible US remakes.<br /><br />Overall, I absolutely loved this film and if you have not watched this film yet, I absolutely recommend one putting this on their must-buy list for 2010.  "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>I guess I should have read the book.<br />Great acting, interesting location, some mildly compelling drama and suspense and lots of monstrous men raping and murdering. And watch the movie in the language it was made.<br />--SPOILERS--An 'empowered' genius female hacker with a big dragon tattoo teams up with an investigator to solve the mystery of a missing girl. She was abused as girl, then by her case worker handling her rehabilitation. She also gets assaulted by men in public. And it turns out the missing girl was repeatedly raped too and was just one victim among countless others of a murderous serial killer rapist Nazi relative and another rapist, serial killer relative. It isn't surprising when they're revealed. I was intrigued by the parallels between tattoo girl and missing girl. Lots of abuse. And a perfect finish to one villain repeats the fate of another. That's what you get when you mess with... The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo! You get burned, baby. Male pigs. I found out after watching the movie the book was originally titled "Men Who Hate Women" but was changed for marketing purposes. Smart move. But it can't be argued the author's chosen title doesn't fit his story.<br /><br />I'm curious to see what David Fincher does with this material because stylistically speaking this film adaptation has the feel of a made-for-TV film. Come to think of it, the story is of the sort that typically runs on the "Lifetime" channel in the U.S.</p></br><a href="../users/AW1493ZQTQ2ET.html">AW1493ZQTQ2ET</a><br/><p>This isn't a deep movie, but I certainly found it entertaining.  It's basically a murder mystery, and there are plenty of twists and turns, as well as a strong sense of suspense which builds as the story unfolds.  Beware that there are some rather dark and disturbing scenes and themes which illustrate the lows to which humans can dip, so you have to brace yourself for that, but this is somewhat balanced by the movie portraying human decency and goodness, plus justice often prevails in the end.  The net result is that, although this certainly isn't a feel-good movie, it's not a horror flick either.<br /><br />Overall, all the elements of the movie are of high quality and they fit together well, so I found it easy to remain engaged for the required 2+ hours.  For me, a big part of the appeal of the movie is that it's set in Sweden (a country I've long wanted to visit), so much of the scenery is beautiful.  The Swedish setting is also important because, if there are attributes of the characters or plot which you would normally find hard to believe, the fact that you're dealing with another culture helps you suspend any disbelief and just go with the flow.  To fully benefit from this aspect, be sure to listen to the movie in Swedish and read the English subtitles, rather than using the corny English voice overdubbing.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this movie to people interested in this genre, especially people who can appreciate its foreign aspect.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>I'm a fervent and early fan of Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy.  I would have flown to another city to watch this film if I had to.  Luckily, I live in one of the country's best cities for art house cinema:  Dallas.  Yes, contrary to the expected stereotypes I always have to bat down when I tell out-of-town friends this fact: Dallas has a tremendous art house cinema culture.  And, as testament to that, we got "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" very early.  What a thrill for us.<br /><br />I am not going to claim that the movie is better than the book.  What makes the books so compelling are the monster-deep dives Larsson takes into varied areas like investigative journalism, corruption, hacking, mafia, governmental affairs, mafia-government connections, intelligence agencies, detectives..and a host of others.  What makes the first book spin is its dual axes of investigative journalism and hacking, personified respectively by Larsson's two protagonists, Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander.  In the movie, something's gotta give: there's just no earthly way director Niels Arden Oplev is going to be able to fit all of Larsson's work into a film of slightly less than three hours.<br /><br />So what Oplev does is strip the story down to its core: the hunt for Harriet Vanger.  It's this case that serendipitously brings Blomkvist and Salander together.  In the process of the focus, we lose some of the flavor that is the hallmark of the book, most notably much of the investigative journalism as practiced inside the walls of Millennium magazine.  Millennium's editor, Erika Berger, is but a footnote in the movie but a big part of the book.  Likewise, little attention is given to the so-called "Wennerstr&ouml;m Affair," the personal and professional downfall that befalls Mikael at the book's outset.  Indeed, the first third of the book focuses mainly on these two elements of the tale.<br /><br />Similarly, we lose out on some other aspects of Mikael's character.  Mainly, his babe-magnetism.  In the movie, he and Salander develop a sexual relationship.  [Indeed, it's undertones of the memories of this relationship that drives much of books two and three.]  But the movie has removed the sexual aspects from two of the other relationships Mikael has with female characters.<br /><br />Despite all that, this movie lives and dies on one turn: it's ability to 'get it right' with its casting of Lisbeth.  Over and over I would to my wife "Lisbeth better be good."  And she'd tell me the same thing repeatedly.  And others I know have the same mantra: don't mess with my ideal vision of Lisbeth.  In that light, Noomi Rapace represents deliverance.  She scored the essence of the character: we want Lisbeth to have that mix of smarts, hardened exterior, quirky beauty, ferocity and manic energy that drives the book.  Ms. Rapace delivers all that in spades.  She's maybe a little less elfin than the character described by Larsson, but other than that, she's the Lisbeth from my head.<br /><br />I urge all fans of the book to see this enjoyable adaptation.  [Oplev made all three movies at once, so the other two are headed this way.]  Embrace the subtitles.  This is a Swedish story through and through.  It deserves to be seen in Swedish.  It's distressing to see US box office totals stalling at less than $10M.  All that is going to do is fuel the drive to complete an insipid US version with some disheartening casting like Brad Pitt as Mikael and god knows who as Lisbeth.  Whoever steps into that role, Noomi Rapace has already left her well behind at the starting line.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JV4QKTEB7QBL.html">A1JV4QKTEB7QBL</a><br/><p>Released just in time to happily mesh with the American publishing advent of the last book in the Millennium trilogy by the late Stieg Larsson, this film adaptation of "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" should provide admirers of Lisbeth Salander (hacker extraordinaire and victim of a renegade faction of the Swedish social system) with more than enough fan-tastic material to orbit them into "Girl" heaven.<br /><br />Director Niels Arden Oplev depicts a Sweden icy in its efficiency; its cleanliness apparent in its scenes of smooth running undergrounds, bridges and autobahns.  Beneath the crisp perfection of the surroundings, a misogynist undercurrent flares with the overt intensity of a laser as illustrated by the instantaneous hatred displayed by a pack of leather-clad youths subjugating a young woman to physical abuse in the subway, a guardian of mature years attacking his ward and a teenager subjected to repeated rape and beatings.  Director of photography, Eric Kress, intentionally showcases gritty up close and personal full screen faces of the film's protagonists where large pores, warts and all contribute to the feeling of an underlying lack of social airbrushing in spite of all the repressed punctiliousness of both the Scandinavian urban and rural scenes.<br /><br />The film's leads, most notably Noomi Rapace as the unconventional Salander and Michael Nyqvist as crusading journalist Mikael Blomkvist, more than adequately do justice to their fictitious counterparts.  Rapace's waiflike appearance, economy of motion and smoldering glares bring the understandably sullen Lisbeth to toxic life.  Nyqvist's vaguely Charleton Heston sensuality and amused sophistication fleshes out the likeable and idealistic Blomkvist but writers Rasmus Heisterberg and Nikolaj Arcel omit the character's casual sexual relationships with Millenium editor-in-chief Erika Berger, Cecelia Vanger and former babysitter Harriet.  Grant it, the film, running over two and a half hours, has little time to waste on gratuitous sexual footage and exploring instead Blomkvist's woes as a convicted journalist and Salander's smoldering rage regarding her tempestuous and unforgivable childhood in a more than adequate adaptation of the novel's main plotline: the collaboration of the two to investigate and resolve a forty-year old murder on an isolated island populated by a wealthy industrial family.  Kress again does a more than admirable job of interjecting B&W stills into key moments of revelation during the investigation.  In particular is the forty year old photo of the missing/murdered Harriet, enigmatically staring out from her photo frame like an avenging Mona Lisa.<br /><br />With never a slow moment, the film whets the appetite for more Salander victory moments--the over fifty art house audience with which I viewed this film was more than familiar with Lisbeth's special skills, dark moods and vindictive motivations; lively conversation before and after the film suggested a group already well-versed through the pages of the novels.  Each time Salander displayed her ample hacking abilities, unselfconsciously took what she wanted and knowingly puzzled out a conundrum of Chinese proportions, the audience burst into appreciative laughter or applause, suggesting that the cult of the underdog as epitomized by the tattooed and pierced eighty-something pound, 24 year old Salander was alive and well admired by the sector of American senior citizens who frequent long foreign speaking films with English subtitles.<br /><br />This reviewer's disappointment came only once with the film's exclusion of the last scene of the novel where Salander, in observing love interest Blomkvist with long-time lover Erika Berger, feels pangs of the ever familiar betrayal, jealousy and resentment of which she has grown accustomed.  Seeing Salander's vulnerability in this context would have segued me right into the next film with no degree of difficulty.  I also wondered if those who had not read the book prior to seeing the film had difficulty keeping all the plot threads tucked neatly into a well-organized ball.<br /><br />Bottom line? Director Niels Arden Oplev's adaptation of journalist Stieg Larsson's 600+ page crime thriller, "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" successfully entertains and captivates its audience with a faithful representation of the first in a series of three films based on the Millennium trilogy recounting the trials and tribulations of an abused and misunderstood girl with extraordinary powers of perception and technological skills.  Cinematography by Eric Kress features a lovely and diffused snow-flaked Sweden compared to the harsh depravity of some of it inhabitants as seen baldly under the glare of too bright light that show every crease, wrinkle and enlarged pore.  Noomi Rapace's performance as Lisbeth smarts with an indignation and nonconformity applauded by audiences of all ages and mindsets.  A thoroughly entertaining and compelling storyline underlined by special skills makes this one a must see for all those who love the crime genre.  Filmed in Swedish with English subtitles.  Mature themes and graphic violence not intended for viewing by young children.  Highly Recommended.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Perhaps it is the current need to see that evil eventually consumes itself that make films like THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO (AKA "M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor") so successful. Or it may be the posthumous fame given Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy (from which this film is 'Millennium: Part 1 - Men Who Hate Women') that has prepared an audience of believers. Whatever the reason this first installment (the other two installments have already been filmed and are ready for release) is being hailed as an epic masterpiece, a film that will go down in cinematic history as a classic. And for that reason you may want to see this current long exploration of the evil of man. But is it a masterpiece.....?<br /><br />Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Heisterberg adapted this book for the screen and the script is interpreted by director Niels Arden Oplev who has cast the many characters of the story with some excellent Swedish actors. By the end of this multi-twisted tale we are left satisfied with the balance of good over evil - or are we? After all we're only part way there and, as in the BOURNE SERIES in this country, subsequent parts to the story become only more bizarre - and exciting. At any rate, the story in brief deals with an investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) whose apparent loss of a case of libel against a wealthy corrupt corporate group results in his being chosen by an elderly but mentally vigorous gentleman Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube) to investigate a long buried case of the apparent murder of his niece -a deed Vanger is convinced is associated with his disgustingly morally corrupt family. Blomkvist is fascinated and begins his tedious examination of film and facts that seem to add clues as to the mystery surrounding Harriet Vanger's disappearance. Enter a punk rock appearing, pierced and tattooed young girl Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Repace) who ends up assisting Blomkvist in solving the conundrum. After some rather confusing bits of replay of Lisbeth's past and the revelation of her current situation with a guardian assigned to control her after her recent discharge from an institution, we are allowed to watch the discovery of 40 years of serial killings of young girls: the fact that they are all Jewish and that Vanger's family contains a number of ex-Nazis boils the pot. Much gore, visual exposure to violence and the results of violence flood the screen as the eventual discovery of the true history of Harriet Vanger is uncovered.<br /><br />The film is two and a half hours long but seems much shorter because of the rapid fire sequencing by the director. Much praise has been heaped on Noomi Repace as Lisbeth and while she performs well, and looks bizarre, one wonders why all the hoopla. This is a good film of its kind, very well transforming a book into cinematic excess, and for those who crave gore and acts of depravity it will probably please. For film goers who prefer thinking to raw action this may not be the choice of a film du jour. In Swedish with subtitles and with English dubbing.

I would have flown to another city to watch this film if I had to.  Luckily, I live in one of the country's best cities for art house cinema:  Dallas.  Yes, contrary to the expected stereotypes I always have to bat down when I tell out-of-town friends this fact: Dallas has a tremendous art house cinema culture.  And, as testament to that, we got "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" very early.  What a thrill for us.<br /><br />I am not going to claim that the movie is better than the book.

Let's face it. Most of the studio films released can barely elicit more than a quick "It was okay". Or perhaps a terse "It sucked".<br /><br />I try to go to a fair number of these every year for these very reasons. Because I love to see films so much, I get sucked in by the hype of the big budget Hollywood films on a regular basis. And I frequently get disappointed. I need Foreign and independent films to provide an antidote to the cookie cutter fare usually perpetrated by the studios.<br /><br />But because American films are so popular worldwide, foreign filmmakers are struggling to find a market for their works, even in their own countries. The solution? Many are making their films more 'American'. Recently, the French thriller "Tell No One", based on an American bestseller, could easily have been the latest Michael Douglas thriller. In fact, I would be surprised if an American remake is not in the works. I think the film only worked as well as it did because the actors are French and spoke their native language throughout, somehow making it seem more intelligent. But the film is marred by an overly expository ending in which the guilty party explains at length how they committed the crime because there is basically no other way for us to know this happened. The film never gives us the clues we need to connect the dots.<br /><br />Now, the Swedish thriller "The Girl With A Dragon Tattoo", based on the international bestseller is a similar, better and more unusual film than "Tell No One".<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist (Mikael Nykvist) is a disgraced journalist; his latest investigative target, a questionable billionaire has sued for liable and won, meaning Mikael must leave the magazine he started in order to save it. To occupy his time, he answers a query from a reclusive old man, Martin Vanger (Peter Haber), once a captain of industry, heading the company his family owned and operated, who now lives more or less as a recluse. Martin wants Mikael to find his niece, who disappeared under mysterious circumstances almost forty years ago. Mikael is reluctant, but a few mysterious photographs serve to pique his interest and he agrees to help.<br /><br />Lisabeth Salander (Noomi Repace) is a street-wise young woman very adept at computer hacking and finding people. She works at a detective agency finding people, making inquiries into their past, digging up dirt. Her inquiries into Mikael lead him to find out about her and he asks her to help him in his inquiries. She must be good to get past all of the firewalls protecting his information. She realizes this may be an opportunity to leave her abusive and violent past behind and agrees to help.<br /><br />As Mikael and Lisabeth begin their investigations, they quickly realize there may be more unexplained mysterious deaths connected and the scope of the investigation increases, becoming more dangerous.<br /><br />Before and during their investigations, they meet some people who are truly frightening. The film doesn't shy away from showing why these people are frightening (especially to Lisabeth) and these moments are a little hard to watch. But these same moments are also one of the aspects that set this film apart. An American film would never depict such brutality, could never depict such brutality and receive a wide release. Don't get me wrong. I think the brutality is necessary to the story, necessary to help us understand the type of character Lisabeth is. If it were simply gratuitous and didn't serve the story, "Dragon" would be a different beast altogether. But because it is a part of the story, it is necessary to experience these moments. Without it, the film would seem hollow and very artificial.<br /><br />All of this is good and all of this adds up to precisely what makes independent and foreign films so interesting to me, so vital a part of my movie going regimen.<br /><br />My problem with "Dragon Tattoo" comes in the last few moments. Much like a bad American thriller, or a television show, the identity of the people responsible is revealed through lengthy discourse from the guilty party themselves. They tell a story revealing all, who, what, when, where, how. And much of it doesn't make sense or add up because we simply aren't given the details. Any details we are given are so buried within the confusing and multi-layered narrative it almost seems like this dialogue is needed to help tie up the loose ends.<br /><br />When writers resort to this method of discourse, it just seems sloppy. If you are writing the film, you have the license to do whatever you want. Make it believable enough and the reader (and watcher) will go with you. I can't comment on whether the book follows this same road because I haven't read it. Given the success of the book, I have to think the screenwriters who needed to streamline the story a bit did this. They cut out some scenes and as a result had to 'tie everything' up in the end.<br /><br />"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is interesting and unusual enough to satisfy the serious cinephile's foreign film bug. I just wish they had been able to come up with a better, more unusual way, tying up the story's loose ends, providing these same viewers with a truly memorable ending. As it stands, it is little better than the ending of an episode of "Murder She Wrote".<br /><br />The remaining two books in the trilogy have already been made into films in Sweden. An American remake is already in the works from director David Fincher ("Seven", "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"). If anyone is able to retain the violent, unusual nature of the story, Fincher seems a good choice. Brad Pitt is a strong candidate for the male lead. It will be interesting to see how this strange hybrid foreign film translates to an American made film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>A rather forgettable serial killer movie.  The thing that's always gonna stick out in my mind, though, is that in the first half of the movie there are three very brutal and graphic rape scenes that had nothing to do with the plot and could have easily been dispensed with.

It has many repulsive characters and some X-rated scenes. This story echoes "The Big Sleep", "Chinatown", and "Roseanna". It starts with a libel suit then turns into a murder mystery (like many of the "Perry Mason" novels). Can you believe a serial killer living in an isolated location? Most serial killers seek areas with a large transient population. It does warn you about the Internet and how it was designed to allow governmental agencies and others to hack into your computer. Is there a political agenda via the characters in this story?<br /><br />An old man receives a package from Hong Kong. What does it mean? Mikael Blomkvist is convicted of libel for claiming millionaire Wennerstr&ouml;m was guilty of gun-running and other crimes. [Would an experienced journalist make this mistake?] Micke will pay a 150,000 kroner fine and go to jail for his malicious report. Who is taking photos of Micke? Researcher Salander says Blomkvist was set up with forged documents. [The danger of a sole source.] Dirch Frode calls Micke with a job for client Henrik Vanger (of the Vanger group of companies). Vanger lives on the island of Hederby; a long bridge connects it to the city of Hederstad. Vanger's niece Harriet disappeared in 1965. She was Micke's babysitter then! "She just disappeared." Murdered?<br /><br />The computer researcher has a new probation officer; he asks questions about her finances, her piercings, and her sex life. Is she obstinate? After Harriet disappeared Henrik Vanger continued to receive a framed flower every year. He wants to know the truth. [Does he have suspicions?] Salander taps into Micke's laptop to spy on him. We see life in a Swedish subway. [Where is Paul Kersey?] Micke does research into the Vanger family history. What can he find out after forty years? What do those 5-digit telephone numbers mean? He looks at old negatives from the local newspaper. Will he find a clue? [Like "Blowup"?] He learns how he was set up with forged documents. [No other research?]<br /><br />Salander asks for 20,000 kroner for a new laptop. Her probation officer insists she be nice to him. [An expose of a corrupt probation system?] Micke notices an overlooked clue in those old photos. Who is the man in a blue sweater? Why has "Wasp" hacked into his computer? What is in the Book of Leviticus? Micke asks Lisbeth for help. They look into an earlier killing. "Are you okay?" [Is there symbolism in the cigarette smoking?] Liv was murdered in 1949, before Harriet was born. [Note the manufacturer of that hired car.] Are they under surveillance? [Ketchup on eggs?] Is that amber necklace a clue? Who shot at Micke? Was it a "hunting accident"? They learn the identity of "BJ". Is there a common pattern?<br /><br />Salander looks up old records and finds a name. Micke learns the shocking truth! "You can't leave any witnesses." [Can you believe this revolting discovery?] Will help arrive in time? [Of course.] Will there be poetic justice in a car crash? [Like "Boomerang"?] Will Salander shed light on her past? Will the crimes of a serial killer be exposed? "He's not coming back." "We don't know anything." "You choose who you want to be." [More irony?] Micke visits Australia, Salander visits her mother. There is a reunion and an exposure of family secrets. Salander brings reading material to imprisoned Micke. Will this expose gun-running and drug trafficking for a happy ending? [The book "Compromised" did the same.] Who was the blond woman who embezzled millions from a Cayman Islands bank?<br /><br />Overall, does this story have redeeming social values? Parts of this story seem implausible. It is an average story hyped with some repulsive scenes. A journalist convicted of libel provides "plausible denial" for his employer. Lisbeth provides added complications and contrast.

Eventually some old corporate owner wants to hire an investigator to find out what happened 40 years ago to his niece.  The movie gets clumsy again and sets up more characters; relatives of the old corporate owner as suspects in the assumed murder of that niece.  From out of nowhere comes a Goth culture early twenties gal, computer hacking her way along a trail of espionage that ultimately places her and the hired investigator together.  The brutality of what the early twenties gal has for an environment includes a corrupt parole officer that makes the viewing audience involved emotionally as she takes revenge (with years of personal abuse and exploitation venting) upon the corrupt parole officer.  I'm not sure if that was to get me to say "Hurrah" or be disgusted at watching somebody lower themselves to the same level just to punish a brute.  It is a bit over done in my opinion, which was no doubt fully intended by the producer and director of this film, and it leaves you hanging for a bit.  There is more sickening and grotesque footage coming, and sadistic, masochistic and otherwise dysfunctional practices come to the screen in enough detail to make the viewer nearly ready to push the eject button on the remote, except for wanting to know if the guilty perpetrator is brought to justice; so the DVD spins on.  There is some wonderful sharing of consensual emotional and physical recreation between the Goth culture young woman and the hired investigator, but by the time the movie gets around to it, this 2-1/2 hour long film has exhausted the viewer mentally and emotionally enough that the roller coaster ride doesn't really seem fun that late in the drama; like it otherwise would.  Noomi Rapace is the Goth culture young woman that I would really like to see in a less dark film, or one that isn't as believable into investigating contemporary crime.  Let's say, maybe she could star in a Sci-Fi/Fantasy feature of ancient Vikings, or knights from the Dark Ages or Renaissance, or futuristic space travel adventures on other planets.  Then put the Goth woman's recreation scene into that format without the horrific, torturous, gruesome crimes against women intended to portray real life possibilities.  Then this actress might get the attention she deserves as an entertainer.  I liked the story well enough, but obviously I'm not into gender crimes against women, and think I'd rather watch a documentary on war and crimes against humanity in general, than become witness vicariously (via DVD) to the misogyny of this film.<br />I watched the movie trailer, and read several reviews, also taking into account the publicity given this film by the recent death of the Swedish author of the book this movie is based upon; and like driving by a fatality traffic accident scene being worked by police and emergency rescue workers - I couldn't look away.  If I got anything out of this movie, it is the concrete reassurance that I don't like movies about crimes against women.  But I will have to admit, this movie delivers everything you anticipate it should - which is why I gave it a 3 star rating.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JTD6D79HNA5X.html">A2JTD6D79HNA5X</a><br/><p>This is my second swedish film... i think.

The film also has a splendid acting role from Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist. Rapace is a face to remember, as she has a great amount of talent as a heroine.  A disgraced reporter named Mikael Blomkvist (Nyqvist) with Lisbeth Salander (Rapace) solve the disappearance of the teenage girl in a rural area of Sweden. This is a dark engrossing film that will have you twitching and covering your eyes at times. There is sexual violence and hard hitting violence of all kinds. The premise is the violence against women in that culture. There are certainly many unhinged people in this film, is it the long cold winters?<br /><br />This is a Swedish film with English sub-titles, but that does not detract from the film one iota. The soundtrack is as dark as the film, and when all comes together, there is a sigh of relief. But, now we know, this is but the first one of three films and I will wait with baited breath for the next two.

At 2 1/2 hours, it might seem that the film would be impossibly, indigestably long. In Swedish with subtitles (there is an English language track), it might seem impenetrable. None of that is the case. I watched it through, in Swedish, and never once glanced at my watch.<br /><br />This is a dark film, but it avoids the lugubrious plodding of the typical Ingmar Bergman film, and it avoids the gratuitous hyperintellectualized symbolism of a typical art house piece. In pacing and material, this film has much more in common with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LINC">The Silence Of The Lambs</a> than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00020HDI0">The Hour of the Wolf</a>.<br /><br />Noomi Rapace plays Goth Girl Lisbeth Salander, a gifted hacker but deeply scarred young woman who works as a Private Investigator's researcher. Lisbeth, who has a history of psychiatric disturbance, is on probation. At the film's outset, she is assigned a new Guardian (a State appointed Probation Officer/Conservator), who brutally rapes her when she meets with him to request her stipend. Lisbeth, with the hardness that only the truly injured can have, retaliates against her tormentor in a grimly satisfying exhibition of sadomasochistic glee, after which she betakes herself back to her own world.<br /><br />Rapace's portrayal of the tattooed, pierced, troubled Lisbeth is so compelling and realistic that I received a slight shock to discover how normative Noomi Rapace appears in the DVD's brief "Special Features" interview segment.<br /><br />Michael Lindqvist plays Mikael Blomqvist, an investigative reporter convicted of defaming a major government official. Despite the fact that it is quite clear that Blomqvist was set up, he has no option but to serve his sentence, deferred for six months. Unable to work for his paper, he is hired by Henrik Vanger, the paterfamilias of a powerful, clannish, but extremely dysfunctional family of industrialists, most of whom live on a private island. Vanger's beloved niece, Harriet, vanished forty years before, and no one has been able to trace her whereabouts. Vanger is convinced that Harriet was murdered, more than likely by a member of the family.<br /><br />Mikael begins to investigate. In the process, he allies himself with Lisbeth. Although most of the Vangers try to dissuade the pair from accomplishing anything substantive, it quickly becomes evident that the Vanger clan is riddled with rot and evil, including membership in the Swedish Nazi Party and a fearful history of domestic abuse and violence, culminating in what appears to be a number of unsolved serial murders.<br /><br />The violence and darkness of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is indisputable and graphic, but it is not gratuitous. This is not a "slasher" film, it is a profound psychodrama and pursuit thriller. It is definitely not family fare, not for the young and impressionable, or for the faint of heart nor the easily distraught, but there is nothing dishonest or excessive about its portrayals.<br /><br />Many reviewers have criticized the film's expressed violence toward women, but such violence is an all-too terrible fact of life in many quarters. The women, too, are not simply victims. Lisbeth, as the eponymous Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, is an unconventional but powerful character, portrayed powerfully, and the other female roles in the film are likewise portrayals of strong women. If anything, the men in THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO are the weaker, less competent, less emotionally, intellectually and psychologically stable sex.<br /><br />This film is not for everybody. However, if you are a cinemaphile, it is an experience that should not be missed.<br /><br />VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED<br /><br />***<br /><br />Having since seen the Director's Cut of the trilogy (which adds a full two-and-a-half hours, the equivalent of an entire movie, to the tale of Lisbeth Salander), I will recommend the Director's cut wholeheartedly. It makes all three movies five star offerings---at the very least.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CK0VXUDVXGMN.html">A2CK0VXUDVXGMN</a><br/><p>This movie kept me intrigued and satisfied as the protagonist, a investigative reporter who is facing jail for libeling a billionaire (would not happen in the US), is hired to unravel what happened to Harriet of the rich Vanger family several of whose members were infected by Nazism.  Despite strong performances by the protagonist and, the girl with the dragon tattoo, the movie lapsed into a tired cliche of finding a serial killer in a convoluted, contrived plot that left me cold. Perhaps I lost something in the translation, but the ending was doubly contrived and left me perplexed.</p></br><a href="../users/AHBNPMHDWZ7SB.html">AHBNPMHDWZ7SB</a><br/><p>I don't quite know exactly how to summarize M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor (The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo). It's a suspenseful drama with aspects of a thriller, and it's based on the Stieg Larsson novel. The story follows an investigative journalist named Mikael Blomkvist who is sentenced to a few months in prison at the start of the film. He has time before he has to clock in and begin his sentence so he takes a job from a very wealthy business man named Henrik Vanger, with a family empire. The business man hires Mikael to find out what happened to his niece that mysteriously disappeared forty years prior. But she's not who the title is based on.<br /><br />The actual girl with the dragon tattoo is a computer hacker who was hired by Mikael's boss to hack into his computer, and find out if he really is guilty of the crimes he was committed for at the start off the film. Don't worry, none of this is a spoiler because we find out all of what I said at the start of the movie. But anyway, the center of the story is the mystery of the disappearance of that wealthy business man's niece. And it is gripping. I have to warn that there are some sexually graphic scenes in this movie. A few of them may actually be hard to watch for some people. But if you can get past that, this movie will turn out to be a rewarding experience. Oh yeah, and it runs at about two hours and thirty-two minutes. So, it may be a little too long to some people, but it never bothered me.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D0PJFW2VY8G.html">A2D0PJFW2VY8G</a><br/><p>I haven't had the pleasure of reading the late Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy but the books have proved a huge success and when the chance came to watch the film adaptation of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo I embraced the opportunity. I was eager to find out why these books have been so lauded but the question is was I left disappointed by the experience?<br /><br />The film follows journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) who is sentenced to three months in prison after losing a libel case against the industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerstrom (Stefan Sauk). Blomkvist is unaware he being watched by a troubled 24-year old hacker, Lisbeth (Noomi Rapace), who concludes her assignment when Blomkvist is imprisoned but continues to monitor his activities especially the files in his computer. Blomkvist is hired by an industrialist Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube) to investigate the disappearance of his niece, Harriet, four decades ago on Children's Day in 1966. Blomkvist is invited to stay with the Vanger family at their remote estate and begins piecing together the few clues that were ever found concerning the missing Harriet. Henrik Vanger believes someone in the Vanger family was responsible for Harriet's disappearance but as Blomkvist digs deeper his path crosses with Lisbeth who draws on all her resources to help him solve the mystery but both journalist and hacker find themselves in the firing line of watching assailants who have secrets they wish to keep buried.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has two interesting main characters. Blomkvist's career is in tatters after his stint in jail and his prospects and reputation for the future does not look good. Despite his problems, Blomkvist does find work investigating the disappearance and suspected murder of Harriet Vanger whose image appears hauntingly throughout the film, a photo of a teenage girl full of smiles despite the sinister secrets beneath the facade of the rich and successful Vanger family. In contrast to Blomkvist is the striking Lisbeth whose past is a painful one, revealed slowly to us as the film progresses. Lisbeth has to report to a probation guardian for regular meetings and at the outset she has a new guardian, Bjurman (Peter Andersson), who takes charge of Lisbeth's finances and distributes her funds only in exchange for sexual favours. Lisbeth may seem an unfortunate victim of this depraved bully but she is resourceful and strong when backed into a corner. Her revenge against her oppressor is less brutal than what he inflicts on her but it is more than satisfying watching Bjurman squirm as Lisbeth reclaims control of her money and leaves him weeping and permanently scarred.<br /><br />The mystery of Harriet Vanger's disappearance is an intriguing one. The clues investigated by Blomkvist and Lisbeth include names and numbers in Harriet's Bible that the police and Blomkvist cannot unravel but Lisbeth is able to decode the sequence very quickly. However, the most striking and unnerving evidence in the film is photographs of Harriet at the Children's Day Parade standing seemingly happy when her eyes focus on an unseen person in the crowd and immediately she walks away clearly frightened. Blomkvist and Lisbeth are certain Harriet is looking at her killer but when they do get an image of the figure she's looking at it is too blurred for an identification to be made. From this disappearance and suspected murder, Blomkvist and Lisbeth unravel a series of unsolved murders that took place more than 40 years ago but as they get closer to the truth things start to become perilous. Blomkvist is shot at while out jogging and members of the Vanger family persistently warn him to leave, keeping us guessing as to who the killer is.<br /><br />Sexual violence is a prominent theme in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and some of the scenes, though often implied, may still be too much for some audiences. If you can overcome these aspects though this is always a fascinating and tense thriller which never seems too long despite being two and a half hours. Nyqvist and Rapace are both excellent as the film's leads, the latter in particular brings a multitude of emotions to the character of Lisbeth, the seemingly fragile victim of sadistic men but deep down an independent and strong-willed woman. Both Mrs B and I couldn't help but laugh when Lisbeth climbed into bed with a surprised Blomkvist and after the couple had sex she leaped straight out of bed and bid him goodnight, the confused journalist having served his purpose! As for the murder mystery of Harriet Vanger, well, that is left till the very end and it's a difficult one to unravel with the ending equally surprising and brilliant.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an excellent murder mystery thriller that remains dark and tense throughout its duration. Boasting a terrific cast, a clever plot and many memorable scenes I'd highly recommend seeing this. As good as Hollywood's take may be I cannot see it topping this version.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>Though it shows how out of it I am, I had no idea that there was a version of this earlier than the Hollywoodization, which is also a first-rate production.  The plot is virtually identical, except for a few variations.  I am happy to say that this one is equally good and yet very different, in large part because of the actors.  Rapace plays Lisbeth as a far more vulnerable and human character when compared to the cold, ethereal Roony version; she also does not make her the kind of lithesome sex kitten that Roony does, but is simply tough, gender ambiguous, and not all that pretty.  Blomkvist is also less heroic and more human (egoistic, ambitious, not so saintly if cause-driven), indeed he looks like a real person rather than the too-perfect Craig.  Frankly, it is great fun to have 2 versions, but this one is better.<br /><br />Recommended with enthusiasm.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SS6VRWCTB7V.html">A3SS6VRWCTB7V</a><br/><p>Interesting Swedish film. Been a while since I watched a foreign drama video and took a while to get used to the pace. This is slow moving but the pace allows for some depth of characters not usually present in American action/drama flicks. If slow, well paced, even through out and kept my interest. Was glad I saw, heard the dubbed version.  Interesting scenery throughout. And "The Girl with the Green Tattoo" is a very special character.  Will say that some scenes are graphic in nature but no gushing blood, etc. Still, some will find these scenes hard to take because of their nature.  Overall, recommend as a mystery drama with good acting. But once again, 2+ hours long and can feel long now and again.</p></br><a href="../users/A15G70V9OBTOVO.html">A15G70V9OBTOVO</a><br/><p>Let me go out on a limb and say there is not the slightest chance a Hollywood remake of this impressive film will be as good as the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A12IRGQLFE4EBA.html">A12IRGQLFE4EBA</a><br/><p>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the story of a very smart, though emotionally disturbed, young woman who through a couple of coincidences and twists finds herself working with a recently terminated progressive journalist on a private murder case.  Unfortunately, I watched the English dubbed version which, in my opinion, took away from the movie.  I'm thinking the English subtitles would have been better (note to future viewers), but it was still a very good film.  There was nothing "new" as far as plot goes.  No strange or unbelievable sequences.... just a good, solid story.  Not having read the trilogy of books that the movie is adapted from, I don't know how it compares, but if you haven't read the books either, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Also, keep in mind that it's a foreign film which usually means that it can be a bit edgy and raw compared to an American made film.  There were a few scenes that I found disturbing, but that's mostly because I've been Hollywood-ized (lol)!<br /><br />I really liked this and plan to watch the others.  Another version is currently being made with Daniel Craig -- I shudder to think (though Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsgard will be in it so it may not be that bad).  I'm glad I saw this one first.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>After resisting for quite a while, I finally decided to check this film out to see what all the fuss was about. After seeing it, I get it ... this is an engrossing, smart, suspenseful film. As a thriller and mystery, it works better than at least 90% of the thrillers/mysteries Hollywood puts out, so I can see why even Americans would be drawn to the film.<br /><br />The film first introduces its two main characters, Mikael and Lisbeth, separately, and then gradually ties their stories together. Mikael is a middle-aged journalist about to be wrongfully convicted of libel (which is apparently a crime in Sweden punishable by prison time) who is asked by an aging aristocrat to investigate the 40-year old disappearance/murder of his favorite niece. Lisbeth is a troubled, 24 year old professional hacker with a dark and tragic past and an even darker present. She becomes acquainted with Mikael while first being hired to hack into his files, and then, after gaining an interest herself in solving the 40-year-old murder, is recruited by him to assist in the investigation.<br /><br />Lisbeth is a knockout character (played wonderfully by an actress, Noomi Rapace, who I've never heard of before but will never forget). She's a paradox and an enigma. She's clearly damaged after a lifetime of horrific abuse, but refuses to be a victim, doling out vengeance and violence mercilessly when appropriate. Yet she also clearly has maintained her own sense of morality and humanity. Noomi Rapace gives a subtly magnetic and charismatic performance, and you can't take your eyes off her when she's on the screen.<br /><br />Although the film belongs to Lisbeth, her character has a nice chemistry with Mikael. As the two work together to dig through decades of one family's dark secrets in order to solve the mystery, the two develop a subtle, tentative bond. Lisbeth is guarded to say the least, but it's clear that she sees Mikael as one of the very few people in life she might actually be able to trust. When Lisbeth initiates sex with Mikael, it seems odd, for many reasons, but it makes sense in a weird way ... maybe it's Lisbeth's only way of showing affection, or maybe Lisbeth just wants to know what it's like to have sex with a man who isn't going to horribly abuse her.<br /><br />By the end of the film, the central mystery has been solved, and some more of Lisbeth's tragic past has been revealed. And as a viewer, I was left immediately wanting more ... which is why the sequel went immediately to the top of my "must watch" list.</p></br><a href="../users/AVT9Q9PTUCDMR.html">AVT9Q9PTUCDMR</a><br/><p>As anyone who loves B movies you stick Nazis and lesbians together and you have a movie. Well, author Stieg Larsson knew what he was doing when writing the book this movie is based on by doing that but this is no B movie. This is easily one of the best thrillers onscreen of all time.<br /><br />The story itself is mindblowing and will wipe out any lefty's preconceived notions that Sweden is or was ever a utopia of socialism (if you've ever been to a Swedish soccer match you know they have their own hooligan "minority," too, even in this so-called open and liberal welfare state). The movie itself is mainly a whodunit that is somehow able through flashbacks, creative editing and a powerful soundtrack to make computer hacking and archival research look exciting.<br />Yet there is plenty of violence (and very graphic so if you are squeamish this is your forewarning) and sex (brief in all cases but often cruel, bizarre and frigthening).<br /><br />The real reason you should see this movie is the lead actress, Noomi Rapace, who plays the bisexual punk (she's not Goth, movie critics!) computer hacker Lisbeth Salander. The woman is a revelation. She'll become every sane person's heroine after seeing her meting out real justice to the villains in the story.<br /><br />Throw in the stark Swedish landscape in winter and the juxtaposition of Stockholm with the village hinterland and its' also a hauntingly beautiful movie. The twists alone will blow your mind.<br /><br />Who would have thought a nation known in cinema history more for the glacially slow navel gazing "fillums" of Ingmar Bergman could decades later singlehandedly revive the thriller genre and make it fresh and new again?<br /><br />The extras feature a great 12-min. interview with Rapace on her taking on the role of Lisbeth. There's also a family tree of the Vanger Family in case you need that to follow who's who among the suspects in the murders.<br /><br />I am now full bore ahead looking forward to seeing the other two movies in this exciting trilogy. You will be, too, after you get over the emotional draining you'll go through watching this 1st installment.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XK1ZCXM66OT.html">A32XK1ZCXM66OT</a><br/><p>Boy, this was an amazing film!!! I mean, there are no words to describe it!!! The story, the acting was all great. The plot is a very simple one.

Then journalist must call on the aide of an even more mysterious female computer hacker to help him piece together the mystery. This is one impressive film to check out!!!

Sure, there are a lot of things missing but they had to streamline a very complicated story into a single film. Despite these omissions, the movie is fairly true to the book. Sure, nobody is going to win any acting awards for this but the books aren't exactly Nobel prize material to begin with. The biggest flaw with the movie is that they under-develop Salander's emotional and/or personality disorders; that's what makes her an interesting character. Even so: good book; good movie.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AGEIT17HENDIS.html">AGEIT17HENDIS</a><br/><p>Now, normally, I am not a fan of psychological thrillers but this one, this Swedish one, sub-titled in English, had me hooked after the first several minutes. Put together an abused, overwrought young woman (with full dragon tattoo and full psychic scars) who has seen her share of life's misery but who is also a technie whiz, a middle-aged Indy news journalist who has been set up by forces unknown (although we know it is some nefarious capitalist, Swedish variety) while just doing his usual thorough investigative job and a request to find a long missing (forty years) girl by a good Swedish capitalist "father" figure and we are off. For a land that is suppose to be something of  a" paradise" there is more social and psychological pathology here in two hours than one would find in, well, America. This is the first of Larsson's books (out of the trilogy) to hit the screen. Bring on the next one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>I'm a fervent and early fan of Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy.  I would have flown to another city to watch this film if I had to.  Luckily, I live in one of the country's best cities for art house cinema:  Dallas.  Yes, contrary to the expected stereotypes I always have to bat down when I tell out-of-town friends this fact: Dallas has a tremendous art house cinema culture.  And, as testament to that, we got "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" very early.  What a thrill for us.<br /><br />I am not going to claim that the movie is better than the book.  What makes the books so compelling are the monster-deep dives Larsson takes into varied areas like investigative journalism, corruption, hacking, mafia, governmental affairs, mafia-government connections, intelligence agencies, detectives..and a host of others.  What makes the first book spin is its dual axes of investigative journalism and hacking, personified respectively by Larsson's two protagonists, Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander.  In the movie, something's gotta give: there's just no earthly way director Niels Arden Oplev is going to be able to fit all of Larsson's work into a film of slightly less than three hours.<br /><br />So what Oplev does is strip the story down to its core: the hunt for Harriet Vanger.  It's this case that serendipitously brings Blomkvist and Salander together.  In the process of the focus, we lose some of the flavor that is the hallmark of the book, most notably much of the investigative journalism as practiced inside the walls of Millennium magazine.  Millennium's editor, Erika Berger, is but a footnote in the movie but a big part of the book.  Likewise, little attention is given to the so-called "Wennerstr&ouml;m Affair," the personal and professional downfall that befalls Mikael at the book's outset.  Indeed, the first third of the book focuses mainly on these two elements of the tale.<br /><br />Similarly, we lose out on some other aspects of Mikael's character.  Mainly, his babe-magnetism.  In the movie, he and Salander develop a sexual relationship.  [Indeed, it's undertones of the memories of this relationship that drives much of books two and three.]  But the movie has removed the sexual aspects from two of the other relationships Mikael has with female characters.<br /><br />Despite all that, this movie lives and dies on one turn: it's ability to 'get it right' with its casting of Lisbeth.  Over and over I would to my wife "Lisbeth better be good."  And she'd tell me the same thing repeatedly.  And others I know have the same mantra: don't mess with my ideal vision of Lisbeth.  In that light, Noomi Rapace represents deliverance.  She scored the essence of the character: we want Lisbeth to have that mix of smarts, hardened exterior, quirky beauty, ferocity and manic energy that drives the book.  Ms. Rapace delivers all that in spades.  She's maybe a little less elfin than the character described by Larsson, but other than that, she's the Lisbeth from my head.<br /><br />I urge all fans of the book to see this enjoyable adaptation.  [The producers had the smarts to make all three movies at once, so the other two are headed this way.]  This is a Swedish story through and through.  It deserves to be seen in Swedish.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IY9M330NKBW6.html">A2IY9M330NKBW6</a><br/><p>I've not read the books yet and this entire series caught me by surprise. I simply had not heard of it before. So I was in salivating mode when I popped this baby in the DVD player. Everything I'd heard about both the books and the movies was very positive.<br /><br />It was everything I'd hoped for. Just everything about this movie is so right.  The set up of the circumstance with Mikael's loss of the libel suet. Meeting Lisbeth and learning of her capabilities as a researcher. The hiring of Mikael for the investigation all happen the right way. You are into these people from the get go. When they start working with one another and these two seemingly opposites start to click it is something to behold. I won't re-tell the plot as many others have already done so, but this story unfolds like a blossoming flower. All the points are clever and well measured. And when there is the inevitable snowballing of information in the final stages, and you think you have it nailed down, there is still an ace up the sleeve.<br /><br />This is a very professional film. All the aspects of production are top shelf. The sets, cinematography, sound and music meld together in a near seamless fashion. Something else I liked is that nobody in the cast has drool over Hollywood faces. They all look like real people. And though not all of the Hollywood type aspects in the storytelling are avoided, it is still clever enough and fresh enough to please even the most demanding of fans.<br /><br />Myself being a big fan of the mystery-thriller genre I put this right up there with "Seven", "The Secret in Their Eyes" and "Silence of the Lambs". It's better than skin deep. It dives down to greater depths and should stick to your ribs like a good spaghetti dinner.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UFV4HALV2OXW.html">A1UFV4HALV2OXW</a><br/><p>If you read the bestselling book, you must see the Swedish movie!

It is a Swedish film with subtitles but don't let that put you off.  The film immediately catches your attention when Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) enters the room.  She is a young punk who has been hired to work with Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) a investigative journalist who just lost a libel case against a corrupt Swedish CEO.  Blomkvist was hired by Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube) an elderly CEO of a group of the Vanger Corporation.  Henrik wants the murderer of his niece, Harriet Vanger, caught.  She disappeared from a family gathering forty years ago on the island owned and inhabited by the Vanger relatives.  Her body was never found, but her Uncle wants the killer found, and he is sure it is a member of the dysfunctional Vanger family.<br /><br />The odd couple detectives, Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander work well together.  Lisbeth is a genius in computers and hacking into sites.  Mikael has good analytical skills and slowly finds new clues that Lisbeth follows up on.  The couple link Harriet's disappearance to a number of gory murders from forty years ago and open a Pandora's box of suspects and torture.<br /><br />This movie is a must see, though be aware it is gory and a bit longer than the average movie - almost three hours.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>In this first movie that's the beginning of a series of Swedish films, famous reporter Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) teams up with hacker Lisbeth (Noomi Rapaca) to solve the case of a woman that disappeared 40 years ago.<br /><br /> We find out only a little about Lisbeth in this first film, for one she hates men for a good reason. For one, a slimy wealthy man gives her money in return for sexual favors and he's also abusive. So when she meets Mikael, she has trust issues. While he is fresh off of a divorce and has issues of his own. But how they bond is touching and intriguing and what makes this violent and even often disturbing film work so well. Since their relationship is moving and Mikael and Rapaca have great chemistry.<br /><br />  Critic A.O Scott some how didn't like this well made thriller, yet he's looking forward to the American remake ? I don't get it. Don't wait for that version because some how they cast the girl from the Nightmare on Elm Street remake as Lisbeth when Kiera Knightley would have been perfect. Plus why wait until next year to see that version, when this version is out and it's not bad. While you also have the sequel coming out on dvd October 26th and the 3rd film coming soon after, so why wait years and years to get the whole story to unfold Hollywood style.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>WARNING:SPOILERS AHEAD!<br /><br />Firstly, I've not read the novel this movie is based on. So my comments are for this film only.<br /><br />Secondly, the most interesting about this picture is Noomi Rapace's engaging acting. She vividly played Lisbeth Salander who was a chain smoker, drinker and skillful computer hacker. What an attitude she had. She did not get mad, she always got even. There was more to her character but I would not reveal them here.<br /><br />Thirdly, the plot was complicated. It dealt with many problems such as police's power abuse, domestic violence, serial killing. These problems were depicted in many extremely disturbing scenes. They made me very angry seeing how much emotionally Lisbeth was suffering.  The plot also involves deep relationship between the  niece and her uncle. The uncle's love for his niece was strongly expressed from the beginning till the end. The last scene touched my heart.<br /><br />Fourthly, the most ridiculous aspect is this movie has at least 4 big logical holes that greatly erode my interest. If it had been a fantasy movie, I'd would have ignored its logic deficiency. However, it's a kind of detective and drama movie. So, logic is one of its foundations! I won't list all of the holes I found but one here. For example, after a member of Vanger family saved Mikael from being killed by the owner of the house he just broke in, he told his savior everything about his investigation. Consequently, he paid dearly later! Before that, the film had always shown most of the Vanger members including his savior just wanted him to go home. Why on earth, suddenly Mikael turned into a man with the brain of a junior high school student? Why many detective/investigative movies have the same problem? Because of this I gave this movie 3 stars.<br /><br />In short, it's worth watching once especially if you want something different from Hollywood stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>This is one of those movies that sucks you in and won't let you go. Whether you has a need to see something violent or you want to feel something or you just need a puzzle to try and solve, this movie had it all.<br />Everything was growing through the cinematic pavement.<br /><br />When I first sat down to watch Girl with, I did my best not to know anything about it. And, really, that helped me out a lot. I went in expecting nothing and I got what seemed like a classic movie that had me from the beginning. You waltz into an investigation that is being carried out about a mising persons case that happened over 40 years old, and the blocks start to stack from there. You have the collision of differing storylines, really great acting, some really dark moments, and a puzzle that is addictive.<br /><br />As one of the characters remarks in the movie, "you are already addicted, aren't you," talking about the case. And, indeed, I was. I kept looking at the pieces and trying to solve this movie, wanting sooo much to find the meaning in every fiber laying in front of me. To me, that is the sign of a great movie - the sexiness hidden inside the chase and the shock when everything falls into place - this movie has that and more.<br /><br />Five plus stars - and don't be one of thos epeople who throws something out because it is foreign and you have to "read it." Watch it three times - read once, watch once, combine tactics. Just don't miss out.</p></br><a href="../users/A24IJY3V0804WJ.html">A24IJY3V0804WJ</a><br/><p>I enjoyed the movie although it seemed to be a very abridged version of the book. For starters the character of Lisbeth Salander played by Noomi Rapace manages to somewhat convey the intensity and complexity that was part of the persona of Salander. Mikael Blomvist played by Michael Nyqvist is suitable as the investigator and Lisbeth's eventual love interest.  I found the movie lacking in suspense and character development that were present in the book. However to enjoy the movie to its fullest, I strongly recommend reading the book.Three stars 7/31/10</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>2.5 stars<br /><br />The book may be great; never read it. But the movie of it is over 2.5 hours, too long by at least 40 minutes, and features way too many lingering shots of everything while creating easy villains to justify manipulative filmmaking. I guess most reviewers here have read the book and would love the movie no matter what, but as one new to the story, I found it laughably implausible and silly: does every family have a Nazi sadist hidden in the attic? It would seem so, along with the ubiquitous corporate villainy and working class hero(es) to thwart them all and save the day.<br /><br />The two leads are good, but the early very sadistic rape scenes were to my mind unnecessary, just another cheesy rape/revenge set-up that so many lazy writers use to create "suspense" and "resolution" and "redemption". We've seen this all before, and in 90 minutes. This girl can just hack into anything? Frankly, the whole thing feels like it was tailor-made to exploit the market of women who've been molested and want vicarious revenge. I can think of no other reason this movie would be rated so highly.<br /><br />I liked the Swedish scenery, and there are some fine shots and ideas here, but all in all I was bored by about 70 minutes in and the next 80 were just flat out predictable and unexciting, with so many plot holes and faux Agatha Christie nods that it became almost a joke.<br /><br />I wouldn't watch this again for all the kroner in Sweden.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" combines several genres- an Agatha Christie style whodunit, a serial killer thriller, a foreign art house drama, an edgy Eurotrash movie, and an American style buddy adventure- into a fine, compelling film that assumes that audiences don't need endless action and a relentless pace to stay interested.  While I had no problem with the subtitled, Swedish language version of the film I saw in the theater, the DVD offers both that version and a dubbed English version, which is actually fairly polished.  Sometimes horrifying, sometimes very moving, always interesting, this film shouldn't be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>Firstly, an admission; I have not read the eponymous book on which this film is based.  However, I have recently watched the more recent film starring Daniel Craig and produced with American money.  As a result, it is inevitable that comparisons will be made between the two films.<br /><br />As much as it may pain some people, I found myself enjoying the Craig film much more.  In terms of plot, they are near identical although I cannot comment on how closely they both following the original book.  Indeed, the only difference I noted was that the surviving niece was located in Australia rather than London.  This is just a minor detail and makes no impact upon the overall plot.<br /><br />"The Girl with Dragon Tattoo" is certainly a dark and menacing film. I was thoroughly taken in by the plot which, although full of various twists and turns, was not difficult to follow.  The screenwriter has done an admirable job.  Too often films can be let down by plot complexities where the viewer is perplexed as to what happened.<br /><br />So, overall this is a good production.  But, as I stated at the outset, the second film is superior to this original.  I might add that this conclusion of mine has nothing to do with sub-titles or dubbing.  It is simply an honest opinion and comparison of the two efforts.  Regardless, I encourage people to see both.  Come to your own conclusions.  You will be rewarded either way.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>I watched the original Swedish film The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (translated The Man Who Hated Women) and it's amazing, after reading the book fairly recently, to watch this foreign adaptation.<br /><br />The original book was Swedish so it's appropriately a Swedish production.  Rather than Blomkvist the disgraced journalist who was the womanizer during his hiring by the Vanger Group to write a bio of the Vanger family as a front and then do the actual work of trying to solve a 40 year old murder case -- the disappearance of Harriet Vanger -- it was quite a different film!<br /><br />It's tough not to compare the book to the film but I'm glad to have watched the film regardless.  Gone is the womanizing, the affair with the married publisher of the magazine Millennium and gone is the cover story to write a bio of the Vanger family.<br /><br />The film is uneven at times.  The whole sexual predator guardian of Lisbeth (the girl with those tattoos) was faithful to the book.  The book though delved deep into her other guardian who helped her out at every turn.  The film skipped all that.<br /><br />Enough fat was cut from the book to make a smooth running mystery film without a lot of back story into the Vanger family, into Lisbeth's life or the sexual antics of Blomkvist.  At the time, the film was uneven and made enough changes to create a mildly disappointing adaptation.<br /><br />Hitchcock could take a mystery book and put his own twist to give an even better adaptation than the book would have fathomed.  On the other end of the scale, the director for Watchmen was too slavish in attempting to film every last panel of the graphic novel rather than cut out anything.<br /><br />In The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, I would have liked more back story regarding the Millennium, the media's zealous hunt for a story, the commentary on financial markets and journalists -- and the extreme cleverness of Lisbeth.<br /><br />So much entertainment, but so much missing.  Rental!<br /><br />The book was better:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307454541">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a></p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>Usually when a novel is a huge critical and popular success, the movie ends up being a disappointment.  Not so in this case.  In fact, this is so perfect an adaptation that I can only hope that we Americans don't try and remake it.  A large part of the reason this works is that it is so obviously Swedish.  The actors are Swedish, the language is Swedish, the setting is Sweden, and so on.  It is perfectly authentic.<br /><br />The biggest challenge was finding the right actress to play Lizbeth Salander, the heroine of this story.  The actress here is outstanding, the perfect choice.  The next lead role, of Bloomquist the journalist, is also well filled. He is a middle aged man whose personality dominates over his appearance, which is exactly right.<br /><br />If you have not managed to read the book, the plot revolves around Salander who was an abused child both by her father and the Swedish government.  As an adult, she has formidable skills.  She is a renowned hacker, the best in Sweden.  She has a photographic memory.  She can scheme and outthink just about anyone.  However, her father and Swedish government still have her as a target so she is never safe.<br /><br />She meets Blomquist to solve the alleged murder of a wealthy young woman from several decades ago.  The patriarch of her wealthy family assumes she was murdered by a family member and he wants the case solved. Sander and Bloomquist are off and running.<br /><br />Although all three novels were excellent, and the same can be said for the movies, it is this first one which is the best all around.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G8D1VN3MVB6F.html">A2G8D1VN3MVB6F</a><br/><p>This is the swedish version of a cinematic interpretation of a great swedish thriller. The book is fantastic, but cerebral. This version reflects that by not relying upon sound effects and other tricks to make the story hit you in the gut. Rather, this one does it simply be catching the creepy nature of the story through acting and how the film is shot. The imagery does a great job of sharing a mood that stresses the loss felt by one character, and that is as clear as the author of the book intended it to be. This is great because it prevents the story from being caught up in over the top imagery and Hollywood tricks. All in all, the best version of this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A18CMGIQZ1OAA2.html">A18CMGIQZ1OAA2</a><br/><p>i absolutly love the story.  im a huge fan of the trilogy. yes they are brutal and i can respect people walking out because of the violence.  its massive. i love the book.  i love the movie.  first ill say that noomie rapace did a phemominal job portraying lisbeth.  she took every step. steps american actors wouldnt generally take to embody the character.  she even got mulitple facial piercings for the film (a ceptum ring and ill tell you if you dont have one.  its a painful piercing. i had a 14 g. in mine.  its like having your nose broke with someones fist.  she did massive exercise to get the maleish body build that lisbeth has.  she portrayed scenes i know people wouldnt want to do willingly.  and she pulled it off to the T.  the other actors as well were amazing.<br /><br />ok nows on to the only downpoint.  these movies are like two and a half hours long so its not like there was alot of choice but they could have shortened stuff and put in some scenes at the end that shows that lisbeth HAD human emotions.  she did.  she was in love with mikael and its stated, yes the L word, in the book.  and the sweet thing with elvis and mikael.  they knocked all of that out.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />by knocking out the fact that she was in love with mikael and how it worked with the reason she wouldnt speak to mikael through so much of the girl who played with fire.  they left the audience blinded.  they made lisbeth look like a winch with no emotion.  lisbeth didnt trust people but she wasnt that.<br />no what they did was end it like she kicked him to the curb after the case was closed.  like she didnt care.<br /><br />is the movie great.  YES! but you must order the books with the movies.  im now reading the girl who played with fire and its done the same way with the film.  to fully apreciate the movies you MUST read the books.  yes they take a long time to read with all the swedish names and the fact that they are done through the eyes of 2 protagonists. you have to pay attention to the details.  but its soooo worth it.<br /><br />ive seen all three movies.1 and  2 on dvd and 3 i saw at a art house cimena on a planetarium dome  which was awesome.<br />by the way the first is most violent one.  if you got through the violence in the girl with the dragon tattoo, youll be just fine through the girl who played with fire and the girl who kicked the hornets nest.  the second has one violent sex assault in it but its not as drawn out as the first.  all three have flash backs of the bjurman/lisbeth rape but in the 2nd and 3rd they are short. you may not want your kids awake but its not as much mental torture as the first that frankly makes you sick at your stomach.<br />i cant even watch saturday night fever but atleast in these there is revenge and or justice.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>One of the better murder mystery films I have seen in awhile. If you don't mind subtitles or dubbing it is well worth a look. A gothic female researcher is running background checks by hacking into a magazine reporter's computer. It seems he has been framed for reporting on a crooked tycoon. Meanwhile he is investigating the forty year old dispearance case of a young girl by the request of a wealthy businessman. The man belongs to an unusual foundation that has several suspicious founders. The reporter has a limited window to investigate while waiting to do his six month sentence for slander. When he uncovers some interesting clues to the case, the researcher decides to help him figure out the meaning of some odd initials and numbers the missing girl left. The tension starts to build as they join forces and find several twists and turns to what happened, and their lives are threatened when they get to close to the truth. Excellent mystery that although not fast paced as some, the story, directing, acting, and camera work make it well worth the patience. This is very much an adult movie with some graphic scenes that may be hard to view by some. They are in fact very well done and in fact clarify the abuse of women rather than detract from the movie. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />CA Luster</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>Wow.<br /><br />That about sums things up.

Based on a best seller novel by Stieg Larsson I haven't read (the first in a trilogy), it starts with Mikael, a middle aged investigative journalist being asked by the old patriarch of a powerful business clan to solve the disappearance of his beloved 16 year old nephew forty years ago. Since this happened during a family reunion at an isolated island, the patriarch believes that she was murdered, and that only a member of the family could have done so. Mikael is soon joined in the investigation by Lisbeth Salander, a troubled but brilliant twenty something female hacker, and soon they are lifting the veil on the very dark secrets behind this prestigious family. Gripping throughout, the film benefits from a number of terrific performances, especially Noomi Rapace playing Lisbeth Salander and Sven Bertil Taube as the patriarch of the clan. While the film is more than two hours long, it is never boring, and all the loose ends are tied brilliantly at the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FPDWTD9AENVK.html">A2FPDWTD9AENVK</a><br/><p>A rogue reporter is hired by a wealthy business man to search for his missing niece, who he believes was murdered by one of the family members living on their island estate some forty years ago. Blomkvist receives anonymous tips on the case by a beautiful young computer hacker with a shrouded past that has been hired to track him. Together, they will uncover a series of murders spanning over four decades as they unravel the family's dark secrets. THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is the first feature film to be made based on Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, the top-selling novels out of Sweden. Niels Arden Oplev's thrilling adaptation combines the shock and suspense of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS with the mystery and intrigue found in THE WICKER MAN. Noomi Rapace plays the street smart Lisbeth Salander, who is repeatedly brutalized by each of the men in her life. Despite Rapace's cold demeanor, she puts forth an electrifying performance as the strong and resourceful researcher with a vendetta against abusive men. She is joined by Michael Nyqvist, whose subtle but calculated maneuvers make him perfect for the role of Mikael Blomkvist. GIRL offers devastating displays of rape and violence that are never sanitized for public consumption. Larsson's contempt for these deplorable acts manifests through Lisbeth's character, who strikes back at her aggressors with a fiery vengeance. The novel is beautifully adapted for the screen, although Oplev is sure to ground the events in reality with his restrained shooting style. Only the ending feels rushed, where many of the unanswered questions are resolved in rapid succession. This tightly-wrought mystery is sure to entrance audiences as much as it shocks and disgusts, making THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO one of the best in 2009.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies</p></br><a href="../users/A2VMT89TCSF105.html">A2VMT89TCSF105</a><br/><p>Swedish movies always had quite a reputation for being "loose" and "liberal". This one is no exception. In fact, it takes Swedish sin to new hights. Sado-masochistic violence, sadistic rape, explicit sex between a middle-aged man and a twenty-something woman, and a serial killer who makes Hannibal Lector look like a joke.<br /><br />Yepp, that's "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" alright, based on the best-selling novel by the late Stieg Larsson. In Swedish, both the novel and the film are called "Men who hate women". Larsson was a left-wing activist and feminist, and probably believed in various conspiracy theories as well. I never met him, but I've met people who have. (One of them used to write reviews here at Amazon years ago.)<br /><br />The heroine of Larsson's story, Lisbeth Salander, is a young woman with Asperger syndrome and a background of mental illness. Her story isn't fully revealed until the sequels, but we do learn that she's a survivor of sexual abuse, a computer hacker and something of a feminist vigilante. In "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", she teams up with a reporter named Mikael Blomkvist to investigate a cold murder case which turns out to have staggering implications.<br /><br />I don't deny that the acting is superb, and most of the actors are well known in Sweden. I'm not sure how much the dialogue looses in English translation, but believe me, it certainly works in Swedish!<br /><br />Still, I don't like the movie. It's too violent and bizarre, and the character of Lisbeth Salander is simply unbelievable. Of course, feminist vigilantes *are* unbelievable (there are very few of them around!), but Salander is just too much.<br /><br />Unfortunately, however, the dark plot isn't completely unrealistic, not after the Fritzl case in Austria and other cases of children kept in captivity. The two other Larsson movies, with their conspiracy theories, are far less believable than "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo".<br /><br />I therefore have very mixed feelings about this one. But since it's Swedish and well acted, I nevertheless give it three stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A15YPJLKLZS0MK.html">A15YPJLKLZS0MK</a><br/><p>This is the highest grossing Swedish film of all time.

The writer/director know that the more controversy you can toss into a pot (plot) the more it sells.<br />(3.) Intellectual detective work seemed like pure imagination and lacked any believability especially the degree to which a low level sophisticated hacker easily and conveniently found obscure non-database linked information either on his/her computers or in their searches.

M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor translates to "men who hate women." Larssons had intended a 10 novel series, but the three published novels form a sort of trilogy by themselves. He calls it The Millenium Trilogy. The novels were published posthumously, and he had some notes and other unfinished books, but these three books would seem to be his legacy. The film is in Swedish with English subtitles. I enjoy foreign films and don't mind reading the subtitles. I like hearing the films in their original tongue. Swedish has a mysterious sound, vaguely Germanic--nothing at all like the Swedish cook on The Muppets.<br /><br />I saw this film at the Majestic Fox Theater in Bakersfield, a vintage movie palace restored to its former glory, as the kick off to FLICS, the foreign film club that allows the good folks of Bakersfield the opportunity to see foreign films that they might not otherwise be able to. The huge theater was packed, and I had no idea what a buzz this film had going for it, fueled no doubt by the bestselling books by Stieg Larssons.<br /><br />Directed by Niels Arden Oplev, starring Michael Nyqvist as investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist, and Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander, the dragon tattooed girl who is paid to hack into Blomkvist's personal files, but then becomes his ally. It is at once an action packed mystery, a study of abuse victims, a story of female empowerment, and an unlikely romance. Though the film has graphic scenes of sex and violence, you never get the feeling that it is gratuitous, just that it is necessary to tell the story of Lisbeth, and how she came to be the way she is. How she refused to be a victim, and fought back against those who would try to oppress her. In some ways, she is like a punk rock female Charles Bronson in his vigilante/revenge mode. She looks like Lady Gaga, but with piercings, and instead of outrageous dresses made out of meat, she wears the black pants and leather jacket of a biker. She is an abuse victim, but when she fights back, you are with her all the way.<br /><br />In some ways the movie is an unlikely romance, or a wish fulfillment fantasy of older men who'd like to be swept off their feet by some hot young hacker on a motor bike. However, it is handled so delicately, and the character of Blomkvist is so pure of heart--he only wants to get at the truth and expose evil and corruption--so you never feel like he is just some D.O.M. (dirty old man). You don't feel like a voyeur watching the movie, either. Though there are some graphic scenes, they don't dwell on anything more than it would take to tell the story. The audience I saw it with covered a wide range of ages, from young adult to seniors, and everyone seemed to enjoy it immensely. They liked having their cake and eating it, too.<br /><br />As good as Nyquist is at conveying the purity of Blomqvist, the character who you'll be thinking about the most in the days to come is Lisbeth Salander, as excellently portrayed by Noomi Rapace. She already had the holes from piercings in her younger punk rocker days, so they had only to paint on the tattoos to transform her into Lisbeth. Throughout many harrowing scenes, she never broke character. Though she tended to have almost a poker face, you really got the feeling that she was a real person going through all these ordeals, and of course, parts of her thoughts were a mystery, but other feelings could be easily read as if they were written in flaming letters 12 feet high.<br /><br />She inhabits her role so thoroughly that there is talk of a boycott unless they use Noomi to play Lisbeth in the English language version scheduled to begin shooting in 2011 with director David Fincher (Fight Club). I don't know that an English language version is necessary, but if anyone is going to do it, it might as well be David Fincher. I hope they do use Noomi, though The Bottom Line is I would find it hard to boycott, regardless of who played Lisbeth.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030745455X">The Girl Who Played with Fire (Vintage)</a> by Stieg Larssons<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030726999X">The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest</a> by Stieg Larssons<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307454541">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a> by Stieg Larssons<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0033HWZS2">The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest DVD (Luftslottet som sprangdes) [Imported] [Region 2 DVD] (Swedish)</a> (2009)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YOZNAG">The Girl Who Played With Fire</a> (2009)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TZS5GK">Worlds Apart</a> (2008) Directed by Niels Arden Oplev<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OTZO5M">We Shall Overcome</a> (2006) Directed by Niels Arden Oplev<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002W1HBM0">As It Is in Heaven</a> (2004) Michael Nyqvist was Daniel Dar&eacute;us<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PJYPYG">Downloading Nancy</a> (2008) Michael Nyqvist was Stan<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H5RCXA">Daisy Diamond  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - Sweden </a>] (2007) Noomi Rapace was Anna</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>A journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) is fed misinformation and publishes this, which leads to a jail sentence.

But a Swedish thriller it is.<br /><br />And the film adapted from the late Stieg Larsson's first bestselling novel is a soon-to-be-classic example of a movie that has way more going on than it appears. It's a bit on the slow side at times, but it also has a raw, stark quality that hits you harder than any Hollywood blockbuster could -- and Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist are nothing short of awe-inspiring.<br /><br />Take-no-prisoners journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) has just lost his reputation, his savings and his freedom (hello, jail sentence!) after a nasty libel suit from an executive.<br /><br />Then he's unexpectedly contacted by aged industrialist Henrik Vanger, to discover what happened to the guy's grandniece, Harriet. She vanished forty years ago from the family's isolated island home, and her body -- alive or dead -- was never found.  When Mikael agrees to take the case, he's cybershadowed by the abused goth hacker Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace).<br /><br />Eventually Lisbeth reveals herself to Mikael by decoding vital information and sending it to him. Intrigued by this strange wounded woman, Mikael asks her to help him in his cold-case investigation, and the two begin unwinding a bizarre string of serial killings from long ago -- all tied to Bible quotes. And as Mikael unearths the clues to Harriet's disappearance, he also finds some skeletons long kept buried.<br /><br />"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" takes the Agatha Christie aesthetic of a locked-room murder with a dozen suspects, and enfolds it in a ruthless look at modern Swedish society and the study of sexual aggression. It's a dark, dangerous, unfair world where the truth is quashed and women are treated horribly -- whether it's the long-missing Harriet or the eccentric, angry "girl with the dragon tattoo."<br /><br />And it translates Larsson's novel beautifully -- there's a raw, almost primitive power to the story, under all the snow and icy Swedish landscape. Niels Arden Oplev gives the movie a sort of stark wild beauty, but also weaves in some horribly disturbing scenes (the ghastly, helpless rape of Lisbeth by her corrupt "guardian" -- followed by a gleefully horrific scene where she gets her revenge). And the murder mystery is absolutely brilliant, especially when Lisbeth unravels Harriet's code.<br /><br />And Mikael and Salander make an intriguing odd couple -- Nyquist's journalist is worn and weary of the world, and both the Harriet case and meeting Lisbeth rekindle his interest in the truth. And Rapace is absolutely electric as Lisbeth, who is one of the most devastatingly brilliant characters in modern cinema -- she's a wild, bleeding creature who hides her bruises behind a mask of piercings and jet-dyed hair, and whose torn-up heart begins to heal a little when she meets Mikael.<br /><br />"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" is blessed with brilliant direction, powerful acting, and a stark look at the way women are treated by cruel men. Not a light movie, but definitely a classic in the making.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Perhaps it is the current need to see that evil eventually consumes itself that make films like THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO (AKA "M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor") so successful. Or it may be the posthumous fame given Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy (from which this film is 'Millennium: Part 1 - Men Who Hate Women') that has prepared an audience of believers. Whatever the reason this first installment (the other two installments have already been filmed and are ready for release) is being hailed as an epic masterpiece, a film that will go down in cinematic history as a classic. And for that reason you may want to see this current long exploration of the evil of man. But is it a masterpiece.....?<br /><br />Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Heisterberg adapted this book for the screen and the script is interpreted by director Niels Arden Oplev who has cast the many characters of the story with some excellent Swedish actors. By the end of this multi-twisted tale we are left satisfied with the balance of good over evil - or are we? After all we're only part way there and, as in the BOURNE SERIES in this country, subsequent parts to the story become only more bizarre - and exciting. At any rate, the story in brief deals with an investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) whose apparent loss of a case of libel against a wealthy corrupt corporate group results in his being chosen by an elderly but mentally vigorous gentleman Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube) to investigate a long buried case of the apparent murder of his niece -a deed Vanger is convinced is associated with his disgustingly morally corrupt family. Blomkvist is fascinated and begins his tedious examination of film and facts that seem to add clues as to the mystery surrounding Harriet Vanger's disappearance. Enter a punk rock appearing, pierced and tattooed young girl Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Repace) who ends up assisting Blomkvist in solving the conundrum. After some rather confusing bits of replay of Lisbeth's past and the revelation of her current situation with a guardian assigned to control her after her recent discharge from an institution, we are allowed to watch the discovery of 40 years of serial killings of young girls: the fact that they are all Jewish and that Vanger's family contains a number of ex-Nazis boils the pot. Much gore, visual exposure to violence and the results of violence flood the screen as the eventual discovery of the true history of Harriet Vanger is uncovered.<br /><br />The film is two and a half hours long but seems much shorter because of the rapid fire sequencing by the director. Much praise has been heaped on Noomi Repace as Lisbeth and while she performs well, and looks bizarre, one wonders why all the hoopla. This is a good film of its kind, very well transforming a book into cinematic excess, and for those who crave gore and acts of depravity it will probably please. For film goers who prefer thinking to raw action this may not be the choice of a film du jour. In Swedish with subtitles and with English dubbing.

Or, more accurately, less bad than the book.  I read the book (actually listened to the unabridged audio version) a year ago while I commuted.  I hated it but kept on till the end just to pass the miles.  I never intended to see either of the two film versions.<br /><br />However, in the past year I saw the lead actor, Michael Nyquist in two other Swedish films and loved him...so when I saw that he was portraying Blomquist I thought I'd take a peek.  In my opinion he helped the film a lot by humanizing the lead character.  In the book, Blomquist was portrayed as a super-stud, who was so irrestable to women that many of them took their clothes off in his presence.  (I chalk this up to fantasizing on behalf of the writer who based Blomquist on himself.)  In the film Nyquist is much warmer, sweeter, more sensitive and actually made me care about him...enough to keep on watching.<br /><br />I liked the woman who played Lizbeth Salander, too, although I didn't relate to her at all in the book.  In the book, she's a one dimensional cartoon but in the film she manages to show some warmth and vulnerability behind the Goth and leather getup.  The original version of the film was Men who Hate Women and I think the change is much better.  This really is Lizbeth's film; she's the one we will remember.<br /><br />Other improvements:  some of Blomquist's sexual encounters with various women are left out, notably that with Berger, his boss at the magazine.  That was a relief!  Somehow the sexual assaults and various other crimes were less horrific here, although the film doesn't spare the sights.  Maybe it was because I knew what was coming, but also I think the book goes into much more details.<br /><br />I liked the relationwhip between Blomquist and Salander; I thought the film got it just right.  In the book it's much more about Berger, which is confusing.<br /><br />The story, itself, has possibilities.  Unfortunately much of it is beyond belief and way over the top in sensational garbage.  I liked the few scenes of rural Sweden.<br /><br />Mostly I think the book and film are way, way, over rated and I would not recommend either.</p></br><a href="../users/A153NZD2WZN5S3.html">A153NZD2WZN5S3</a><br/><p>A nice movie of an investigative journalist and his assistant  -a bi-sexual girl with a dragon tattooed on her whole back-  hired to solving a forty-year-old mystery of a disappeared young female, a member of a rich clan in rural Sweden, disclosing intentionally or by-a-way racist anti-Semitic mafia realities of this so high-flying kingdom, and such a rare revelation added, perhaps, to the work's hit status worldwide.<br /><br />It is a really nice low-budget film sliding into a fair-tale at the end, at least a dramatic rescue of a journalist and his later voyage to Australia while awaiting a start of a jail term sure examples of are.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YVDY3TISDRE1.html">A1YVDY3TISDRE1</a><br/><p>don't want to give away too much of the plot, but...let me just briefly say that if you like thriller/suspense type of movies, then you will definitely want to see this.<br /><br />movie is based on a Scandinavian book, which is a world-wide best-seller.  In fact, there is a trilogy of books, and movies based on those books, of which this film is the first in a series of three.<br /><br />The plot involves an investigative journalist; he is hired by a man to investigate the death of a niece of his dating back decades ago.  There are possible clues that the person was killed by someone in her own family.<br /><br />Along the way the journalist finds help and assistance from an unlikely source and they develop a close bond.<br /><br />* this is the best thriller movie I have seen in years.  Can't wait to watch the other two movies in the series.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>So we all know that this is a Sweedish movie with English subtitles, right? And we all know that Director David Fincher will re-release an American version of the film next year with a completely different cast, right? And we all know that the movie(s) is based on the first of three books in a trilogy by Sweedish Author Stieg Larsson (RiP), right? And we all know that the original title of the book and movie were changed from Men Who Hate Women to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo so that it would be more well received marketingwise in the US and not perceived as a bash against men by antisexism groups, right? And finally, we all know that the second film in the trilogy has already been released in Sweeden with less than positive reviews and the third in the trilogy will be released later this year...right?<br /><br />Whew. With all that out of the way, I thought The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was great. Two story lines woven together nicely (albeit with the burden of reading subtitles from start to finish). The first story line follows Journalist Mikael Blomkvist after being convicted of libel for accusing a high powered businessman of gun running and other unethical and illegal activity. The widely publicized trial brings Blomkvist to the attention of another high powered businessman named Vanger looking for a long lost niece.<br /><br />Enter storyline 2: A Goth lady named Lisbeth works at a security firm that Vanger has hired to determine if Blomkvist is the right man to hunt for his niece. And the story arcs from there to the struggles of Lisbeth's everyday life of trying to make ends meet while on probation for some serious crimes committed in her relatively distant past.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, both stories are ultimately connected with each other in a thriller tale of intrigue, deception, mystery, murder and revenge. Actress Noomi Rapace plays Lisbeth with a seriousness that makes you think she's a real person out there somewhere, and that a camera followed her like a fly on the wall. And be warned, there are some scenes of rape and torture that are very unsettling and difficult to sit through in this film.<br /><br />I don't know why Fincher feels the need to re-do this movie in America, because the Sweedish version couldn't be more well done. It's a very good movie that stands on its own with no cliffhanger ending that requires seeing the upcoming sequels. Highly recommended but not for the squeamish.</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>I have not read Stieg Larsson's trilogy so I can to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo unaware, for the most part, of the story. My wife, who has read the novels, filled in my gaps.  The film grabs and holds your attention from the beginning as the mystery of the forty-year disappearance of Harriet Vanger seems to deepen rather than become resolved.<br /><br />I especially liked the editing where the stories of Mikael Blomkyist and Lisbeth Salander are told, side-by-side, before they become devoted to solving the mystery.  There were parts of the story of Lisbeth - her relationship to her father and mother - that were inexplicable. We see Lisbeth as young girl setting a man on fire in his car without knowing why she is doing this or to whom.  We also don't know why her mother is in a nursing home.  This actually is a critical part of the story for Lisbeth's character and perhaps a few minutes could have been spent relating her troubled past.  For me, this was a small matter compared to the overall excellence of the film.<br /><br />The performance of Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth is something to behold. I can't recall a recent performance that was so mesmerizing. Michael Nygvist is excellent as Blomkyist and he plays well off the darker character of Lisbeth.  Together, Lisbeth and Blomkist make an interesting investigative team as they unravel the depraved Nazi past of members of the Vanger family.  The film is very graphic in the scenes of Lisbeth's rape and her revenge on her "guardian" and in the murders that Lisbeth and Blomkyist uncover on their way to the truth.  Viewers who are sensitive to violence may want to opt out of viewing the film.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is well acted and filmed. It is the best thriller/mystery that I have seen in a longtime.  At two and a half hours, the film has no boring spots; your attention remains rapt until the surprising conclusion.</p></br></body></html>

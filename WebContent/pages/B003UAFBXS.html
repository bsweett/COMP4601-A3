He's aged and has a bad hip with mysterious growth on his winky, there has been some mysterious deaths and disapperences in the place as an ancient 3,000 Egyptian mummy named " Bubba Ho-Tep". He joins forces with an aging black man who calls himself John F. Kennedy ( Ossie Davis) to take on the dusty soul-draining cretin and send it back to hell where it came from.<br /><br />An amusing and funny independent movie that blends elements of horror, comedy, fantasy and parody with some original ideas, great low-budget special effects ( for instance, Bubba Ho-Tep himself), some weak acting ( hey it's a b-movie!), and it's a fun movie.<br /><br />The DVD is great with chockloads of extras such as two audio commentaries, featurettes, deleted scenes, trailer and more, weither you love or hate it, this movie is a must see and shall be a modern day cult masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>BUBBA HO-TEP (love that name!) may be one of the wackier forays into horror you'll find (Elvis Presley and JFK take on the Mummy...I'm NOT kidding!), but it actually works, thanks to Don Coscarelli's assured direction, and the likable performances of the two leads, Bruce Campbell and Ossie Davis.<p>A kind of modern tall tale, set in a run-down nursing home in the bleak Texas desert, the story involves an aged Elvis (or his greatest impersonator), barely able to walk, and with a disgusting canker sore on his privates, drifting in and out of a drugged haze. Played by a dead-on Campbell (who sounds so much like the King that I thought, momentarily, that he was dubbed), he spends his few moments of lucidity ruminating on losing Priscilla, not 'being there' for his daughter, and the failures of his life.<p>His only 'friend' in the home is an aged black man, claiming to be John Fitzgerald Kennedy, much of his brain &quot;replaced by sand&quot;, and his skin dyed black by LBJ and the other conspirators who 'faked' his assassination. Legendary actor/playwright Davis gives the role a quiet dignity, not attempting to mimic the President, and his authority, even in his most outrageous statements, makes the elderly character seem totally sincere.<p>As fellow patients begin to die off, and a weird, ugly beetle-like scarab attacks Elvis, JFK pieces together a theory; that an Egyptian mummy has somehow been unleashed, who is sucking the souls of the helpless victims out of their rectums (as I said, the man is given to some wild theories). As it turns out, there IS a mummy prowling about, and this being Texas, he is complete with a cowboy hat and boots! Knowing that no sane person would believe them, the pair, revitalized by purpose, arm themselves with available 'weapons', and 'take on' the soul-sucker by themselves...<p>While the script has some hilarious one-liners and physical humor, the film is actually played fairly straight, as Coscarelli understands that the protagonists would generate far more audience sympathy if presented as 'real' people, and not caricatures. As crazy as the heroes are, you'll be hard-pressed NOT to root for them at the film's climax!<p>BUBBA HO-TEP has all the makings of a future cult classic, and if you're in the mood for something COMPLETELY different, don't miss it!</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>I laughed when a friend suggested this movie. "Yeah, right," I answered, eyes rolled up. "Well," he finally said a few weeks later, "Here, just look at it. Take my copy and bring it back."<br /><br />"Okay, " I answered, "what do I have to lose? "<br /><br />Obviously, I was shocked. This has to be one of the all-time surprises I've ever encountered in movie-watching. Who would have thought this film was this good? Talk about "original!" This is about as original and entertaining as they come....so I have to rank this film right up there with my comedy favorites.<br /><br />I refuse to detail the story because the more you explain what it's about, the stupider is sounds and the less likely you will give it a shot. I will say Bruce Campbell does a fabulous job of imitating Elvis Presley. In fact, he is the best I have ever heard, speaking-voice-wise. Ossie Davis is also a hoot as the old black man who thinks he's President John F. Kennedy. See? I can't say more, because it gets worse, story-wise, the more you explain.<br /><br />Just trust me that if you appreciate dark humor with some horror thrown in, you'll love it. It's a bit sleazy and the language is very rough, so be ready for that. I guess you could say this "is not for all tastes." You have to be a little warped to enjoy this, but most of us are to some degree.<br /><br />Just be ready for one of the oddest films you've ever seen.  For added entertainment I've heard that Campbell's commentary on the DVD is one the best ever put on a DVD, but I have yet to check that out.</p></br><a href="../users/AYUFQY3XG4ZBR.html">AYUFQY3XG4ZBR</a><br/><p>Some 25 years ago a no-name director wrote, produced, edited, correographed, and of course directed a surprise sleeper horror movie success that eventually spawned its own franchise of sequels, "Phantasm".  I've given that movie a thorough review elsewhere, so we won't dwell much on it here...but it did prove that a full generation before "The Rebel Without A Script" (Robert Rodriguez) burst upon the scene, that it was possible to create a successful motion picture with very little money if you had a good story to tell.<br /><br />Years later we know that director as Don Coscarelli, since successful with both the "Phantasm" and "Bestmaster" franchises under his belt.  And today he still proves that an independent production at the grass roots level can succeed as long as the story has a hook.<br /><br />And "Bubba Ho-Tep" has more hooks than an East Texas bass fishin' tournament, baby.  I was happy to watch this movie and review it on the day that Elvis is alleged to have died (16 August); I can see it becoming an annual tradition for me now.  On the surface it is about two retirement home residents who may or may not have all of their faculties about them.  One (played by the Cary Grant of Cult Films, Bruce Campbell) believes he is actually Elvis Presley, stuck in limbo after an attempt to escape his own fame led to his switching places with an Elvis Impersonator who ended up dying in his place.  The other (played by the legendary Ossie Davis...wonderfully out-of-phase here) believes himself to be JFK, waylaid either by Lyndon Johnson, Fidel Castro, or possibly the Mafia.<br /><br />Perhaps as content as they can be living their last days in a semi-vegetative state, they become aware that an other-worldly force with its origins in an ancient Egyptian tomb is using their rest home as a means to feed on the souls of the living so that he may continue his own existence between the planes of life and death.  With nothing better to do, they decide it's up to them to stop him...to stop Bubba Ho-Tep.<br /><br />The movie is of course as campy and schlocky as you could possibly imagine.  Some of the special effects are particularly questionable (the scarab that does battle with Campbell's character seems a nod toward Coscarelli's previous insectoid creature that terrorized the heros in "Phantasm" all those years ago), and there is no way that anyone could under any circumstance take this as a serious film at any level.  But upon closer examination, there is a powerful sense of melancholy associated with the film, particularly in Campbell's superb voiceovers.  Not only does he do a very passable Elvis impersonation, but he proves himself to be an actor of very poignant capabilities, something that anyone who dismissed him after "Army Of Darkness" would never suspect.<br /><br />The underlying sadness to this film is inescapable; the autumn years of so many in our society are lonely and depressing as we are left to rot away (figuratively and literally in the case of "Elvis's", uh, member) in exile, alienated from the families we once led before becoming an embarrassing burden.  There are plenty of moments that lighten up the film, but the presence of Bubba Ho-Tep is strictly metaphorical; by falling from society's relevance we lose our souls if not from our own choosing and doing than by society's cold disenfranchising of us once we're deemed too old to be of value.<br /><br />It is probably one of the finest cult films of all time, not only for its complete off-the-wall plot and performances, but also for its social relevance regarding the plight of our senior citzens.  And the DVD is particularly loaded with all the bells and whistles a film buff could want...the commentary tracks, background information on the movie, trailer, and Coscarelli was good enough to direct and include a music video for the score, as well.  It's a good recommendation for people who fancy truly bizarre films that fit into multiple categories...for Elvis cultists (and we know who we are), it's yet another "possibility" to warm the hearts of those who still question whether he is really dead.  For horror movie buffs it's a good throwback to the days of hand-made features, and for someone who's looking for an excuse to tell their friends "I've just seen the weirdest movie EVER", this one really takes care of business, baby.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>BUBBA HO-TEP is one of those quirky works of brilliance (like Spider Baby, Evil Dead 2, Donnie Darko, etc.) that make you scratch your head, while making you laugh and want to see it again. Bruce Campbell IS Elvis Aaron Presley! He's got the voice, the moves, and the attitude of the aging KING. Bored with his life as an aging rock icon, Elvis trades places (back in the 1970s) with one of his impersonators, Elvis tours as an imitation of himself, only to throw his hip out, sending him off the stage, into the crowd, into a coma; and eventually to the Shady Rest old age home in Mud Creek Texas. Now, instead of wowing audiences of screaming fans, Elvis finds himself bedridden and nearly fossilized. Then, a 3000 year old mummy shows up and starts thinning out the geriatric herd as it were. Joined by John Fitzgerald Kennedy (Ossie Davis), Elvis begins piecing together clues to unravel this Egyptian / Texan mystery. Can Elvis and JFK stop this shambling, musty horror in time? Can they keep it from sucking out the souls of everyone at the Shady Rest? Can they stay awake long enough to defeat this evil?? Watch and see! Highly recommended...</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Elvis is alive and well--ok, maybe not too well.  He threw out his hip a long time ago, and he's aged quite a bit.  He's living in a retirement home in East Texas, along with a new friend--who, despite his skin color, believe he's John F. Kennedy.<br /><br />No one believes that Elvis is really who he says he is.  But his annonymity and age are about to become obsolete...because a new presence has invaded this rest home: a cowboy-hat wearing, soul-eating mummy, one with an attitude, a voracious appetite, a hoarde of scarabs, and one bad complexion.  Together, Elvis and JFK must stop this mummy before it's too late!<br /><br />Like I said--quirky.  Bruce Campbell is at his best--sarcastic, bitter, and yet surprisingly sensitive; his portrayal of Elvis is both loving and satirical.  Ossie Davis, as JFK, is an absolute wonder to watch; these two great actors play off each other wonderfully.  And then there is the directing, the script, the atmosphere...this is one horror-comedy that's guaranteed to delight.  "Bubba Ho-Tep" is one film you can't afford to miss, whether you're 14, 40...or 4,000.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Elvis is alive ...and living in an east Texas retirement facility, although "living" might be too gracious a term -  he spends most of his time in bed, getting his "crankshaft" lubed-up by one of the nurses. You see, his "fixture" below the waste has a big cancerous tumor on it, which will be the ultimate downfall of The King.<br /><br />Or will it?<br /><br />As Elvis lies in bed, using his bedpan, hoping for an erection, or just wasting away, strange things begin to happen. A weird cockroach (actually a scarab) wanders the halls of the old folks home. And following the cockroach is a cowboy-boot-and-cowboy-hat-wearing mummy! What? Not only that, but this mummy survives by sucking the souls out of the elderly population in Elvis' care facility. I mean, who's gonna notice if a few old geezers die off unexpectedly, right?<br /><br />Enter JFK (yes, he's still alive too, but has been dyed black and his brain removed for reasons of national security), who stumbles upon the secret of the ancient, soul-stealing creature. This mummy was being shown around the United States in the 1940s, but the bus transporting his body crashed into a nearby river, and the creature was freed from his sarcophagus. Uh-oh.<br /><br />Can two washed-up American icons beat Bubba Ho-Tep?<br /><br />****************************************************************************<br /><br />This is one of those films that you just HAVE to see to believe. If you've come this far in my review, I have no doubt struck your interest (or, at the very least, some form of morbid curiosity in you.) So let me tell you a bit more about this film's machinations.<br /><br />Bruce Campbell (aka The King of Camp) stars as Elvis Presley. Elvis didn't die on the toilet, but instead had traded places with an Elvis impersonator in hopes of getting back to his roots. But a fall off of a stage ended the real Elvis' days and put him in a convalescent hospital, while the fake Elvis (masquerading as the real King) is the one who dies of a drug overdose. So, of course, no one believes Elvis is Elvis, just thinking he's some crazy old coot who would've liked to have been the King of Rock-n-Roll.<br /><br />This is Bruce Campbell's ultimate roll. It is the character he was BORN to play. Looking at him and the extensive make-up he wears (over two-and-a-half hours worth every day of the shoot), it's often hard to see the actor and not the character. Mr. Campbell's moves, voice, mannerisms, and looks match that of an aging Elvis so well that suspending believability was easy.<br /><br />And speaking of suspending believability ...<br /><br />A lot of you may be asking "How the heck can you believe that a black man is JFK?" It is possible. But only when someone as strong as Ossie Davis plays the character. Let's remember, this is the same actor who gave the eulogy at Malcolm X's funeral.<br /><br />Although this film has been called many things (campy humor, mummy comedy, Elvis-mummy-horror-drama-comedy, etc.), to me it clearly defies categorizing. While there are definitely some laughable moments, especially when Bruce Campbell uses old Elvis cliches (i.e., "Don't make me use my moves on ya, baby!" etc.), there are also some incredibly dramatic shots that make you think about those that live in care homes around the world, and how families often throw their unwanted elderly into them. Early on in the film while Elvis is lying in bed, he watches the world move by him in super-fast speed, drugged up on medication or his mind just not caring what happens. We also get to see his roommate pass away and his roommate's daughter come to collect his things. It was the first time Elvis had seen her in the many years that his roommate had been his roommate. A terrible and truthful exposition on today's society.<br /><br />It's also worthy to note that the film's speed is slow to get moving. And thankfully so. The build-up within the characters' lives was key to gaining understanding and empathy toward JFK and Elvis. So when we see Elvis (Bruce Campbell) using a walker throughout the film, but moving his hips like Elvis, it becomes both poignant and hilarious at the same time.<br /><br />I also need to mention that, although Bruce Campbell is the king of campy films (Evil Dead, etc.), this film was a giant leap forward for him. As I watched Bubba Ho-Tep, it was often times difficult to relate to it as "campy". It really didn't feel that way at all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>I'm as huge of a Evil Dead/Bruce Campbell fan as the next horror fan, that's what got me to buy and watch this movie, Bruce Campbell. He's the man. Anyway, I thought by the end of the film, it was very good. Who would have thought that a movie about Elvis fighting a acient mummy in a retirement home would actually be a good film premise? I don't think anyone who watches this movie really thinks so until it's over and you realize "Hey, this wasn't half bad." Leave it to old Bruce to take a dumb idea and make it original and brilliant in an artistic way.<br /><br />Overall I say the movie is worth seeing, but you will have your fill of the "crank shaft" jokes by the end of the film. Believe me, they go into more detail about the King's stick problems than I want to know.<br /><br />Ossie Davis actually pulls of a great JFK and actually doesn't look that stupid while he's telling the story of how his skin was dyed and brain removed for national security. It takes a skilled actor to say a line like that and be convincing. And that he was. R.I.P.<br /><br />The movie, as with any BC movie, has a lot of humor, some of which is hysterical. I love how Bubba kills the people by sucking their souls out of their rear holes. lol.<br /><br />"I'm not going to wait and let him wrap his lips around my a**hole."<br /><br />Overall, I'd say that Bubba Ho-Tep was kind of iffy at the beginning but really does come of a winner in the end. Like all independant films, this film has you blushing more than once at what is spoken, but if you can get past the wiener jokes you will find a gold mine movie experience you will never forget. Worth watching, really worth getting if you are a BC/OD fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A5UMUVEV1RUS9.html">A5UMUVEV1RUS9</a><br/><p>Why the common ground of course is Bubba Ho-tep, a strange little movie that seeks to combine some of the most bizarre ingredients to form a film. I rate this with an official 3 1/2 stars because it was very fun, entertaining and strange, just as I had expected. I'd been told it was similar to Shaun of the Dead in that it's more funny and bizarre than frightful, and I agree, but that's where the similarities end. The movie cleverly comes up with an explanation that Elvis isn't dead...he's just riding out the rest of his life in a convalescence home in east Texas. The residents all start dying off and Elvis and his partner JFK now are on the hunt for a mummy that's apparently responsible. Honestly, movies don't get more silly than this when it comes to plot, but Bubba Ho-tep is a lot of fun. Just don't watch it expecting to be frightened...expect to laugh quite a bit though. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Bruce Campbell is ingenious as Elvis in Bubba Ho-Tep. His lines can be crude, yet he manages to still bring some charm to the part. The story about how Elvis didn't die and just switched lives with an impersonator is pretty clever. While it's also funny about how the late great Ossie Davis plays JFK that claims he was dyed black after his assination attempt. I would've gave it a higher rating but it gets a little too campy at the end and Campbell's performance isn't as good as it was in the beginning. He still makes  a very likeable sleazy old Elvis though. While Ossie Davis is brilliant and funny in one of his last roles.  I can't lie and say this is the best movie you'll ever see but I can say that it at least deserves a try.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>Many of the great films deal with old age and the ending of an era: The Wild Bunch, Citizen Kane, The Leopard, Once Upon a Time in America, The Lion in Winter, Touchez Pas au Grisbi, Unforgiven, Ride the High Country... and Bubba Ho-Tep comes surprisingly close at times to making the cut alongside them. On the surface an outrageous schlock movie with a premise that even Troma might find dodgy - an elderly Elvis and a black President Kennedy team up to destroy the soul-sucking Mummy in cowboy duds killing residents in their old folks home and defacating the remains in the visitors toilets - the reality is a surprisingly moving reflection on old age, unfulfilled expectations, loss of dignity, loss of self and the emptiness of celebrity in a culture that doesn't want its heroes to ever age. Bruce Campbell's Elvis-in-a-Zimmer-frame is a truly remarkable performance, never mocking, never going for cheap laughs, capturing the public face of the legend and the private disappointments of the man as he slowly realises he's treated his life a lot worse than life has treated him and finally gets the chance to really be the hero he always wanted to be. There's an epic dimension to the character that never spills over into grandiose mythmaking, firmly grounded in the horrible everyday reality of living in a place where friends regularly die or can't remember you, where family ignore you and other residents will steal from the more vulnerable. It genuinely is one of the great performances in independent movies.<br /><br />Kudos too to Ossie Davis' President Kennedy, similarly playing it straight despite the lion's share of absurd dialog and character quirks: when, in the film's most iconic moment, the King in his Rhinestone suit, cape and Zimmer frame and President Kennedy in his best suit and wheelchair make their way down the corridor for their final confrontation, they really are genuinely heroic figures that you're rooting for even if they do have mobility problems. The downside is that the horror side of the movie is less considerably effective, the jokes never as funny as you'd like them to be, the fun never frantic and one scene too many with the would-be comic hearse drivers. But the compensations more than outweigh the cons (not least of them a versatile electric guitar theme from composer Brian Tyler that has the flexibility to be both tender or stirring depending on the orchestration). This is a film with real emotional weight - indeed, the ending is genuinely touching in a lump-in-the-throat, I've-just-got-something-in-my-eye kind of way. All is well...<br /><br />MGM's disc is very impressive for such a low budget picture, but those with multi-region players might want to check out Anchor Bay's PAL 2-disc UK release which has even more extras.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>A purposely over the top schlock-fest directed by Phantasm director Don Coscarelli and starring Bruce &quot;Evil Dead&quot; Campbell as Elvis Presley; Bubba Ho-Tep insane comedic horror hybrid that is as fun as it is ridiculous.  The story reveals that Elvis didn't die, and instead lives at a rest home in Texas with JFK (Ossie Davis) whose body was died black and brain transplanted in a matter of national security.  The resthome however is soon terrorized by an ancient mummy with a penchant for cowboy boots who is sucking the souls from the elderly residents; and it's up to the King and JFK to stop him.  Purposely ludicrous, but at the same time sincere, Bubba Ho-Tep is pure laugh out loud hilarity from beginning to end.  Campbell is perfect as Elvis, giving what maybe the best performance of his career.  His imitations, karate, and voice of Elvis are nearly perfect.  The makeup and effects aren't bad either for a low budget movie, and the whole cast and crew seems to be having a blast doing this.  Bubba Ho-Tep's only flaw is in it's pacing and final showdown which could have been better, but all together this is definitely worth seeing.  The DVD features are plentiful for a single disc DVD release, with an intriguing making of and two commentary tracks; one of which is Campbell as &quot;the King&quot; which is absolutely hilarious.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI.html">A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI</a><br/><p>4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiece<br /><br />Hilarious horror /black comedy film! You Bruce Campbell addicts will jump for joy over you're mummy's sarcophagus, as Bruce fights the evil of "Bubba-Ho-Tep," as no other than the "King of Rock n' Roll" himself, Elvis, or at least he thinks so. Ossie Davis is his cohort in battling this evil, or should I say, cohort in delusion, as he thinks he's president, "JFK." Only one problem, he's black. Never the less, the dynamic duo set out to battle evil incarnate, "Bubba-Ho-Tep, to save their home & fellow neighbors, living in a retirement home from certain death & damnation!<br /><br />Campbell's best film since "Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn," & possibly his best performance too, though you got to love Ash in "Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn" & especially "Army of Darkness." Either way, "Bubba-Ho-Tep" is a moldy bundle of funny bones, all wrapped up in a smartly directed, well acted, piece of brilliance. Bruce Campbell may well be the most overlooked comedic actor of his generation, & that people, is the true horror! A shame.</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>Bruce Campbell stars as a retirement-home bound Elvis Presley in writer-director Don Coscarelli's (The "Phantasm" series) zany horror/comedy "Bubba Ho-Tep." If the names Coscarelli and/or Campbell mean anything to you, you're in for a guaranteed good time.<br /><br />While The King can only lay in bed and lament over his mistakes and how life has effectively passed him by, the decrepit retirement community he begrudgingly calls home comes under attack by a soul-sucking mummy with a fondness for brown eyes. Together with an equally delusional and crusty resident in the form of John F. Kennedy (Ossie Davis), Elvis drags himself out of bed to hunt the titular character. It's a last-ditch effort at redemption and besides, he doesn't have anything better to do anyway.<br /><br />Campbell is given his best role since playing Ash in the "Evil Dead" series, and he eats up every bit of it. His take on Elvis Presley is every bit as hilarious as it is bitter. One minute he's spitting one-liners at his care-givers, the next moment he's grumbling about an unfortunate growth on his undercarriage. Though the film offers Campbell many silly scenarios to wade through, he still manages to make the send-up seem somewhat serious and heartfelt. He's less a parody of Elvis than he is a vague approximation of what the man may have been like had he been given the chance to grow old and lose his marbles.<br /><br />Meanwhile, thanks to a steady hand by the ever-reliable Don Coscarelli, the film never sags or gets soggy. All the hallmarks of a Coscarelli film are there -- the nutty, nightmarish images, the unrelenting goofball humor -- making for a delightful cocktail that is one part parody and one part horror with a dash of drama thrown into the mix. Coscarelli balances all of this with ease and delivers a film that moves as slickly as its cinematography. This is truly the director on top of his game.<br /><br />All in all, "Bubba Ho-Tep" is a deliciously fun piece of fantasy that doesn't ask much of its audience. Though it touches lightly upon themes of aging and the way we treat our elders, the film's main purpose is to entertain and to that end, it's a smashing success. Sure, if one were to inspect it closely enough, they'd find a few surface flaws, but where's the fun in that? What a shame Campbell and Coscarelli couldn't make a sequel work, as more films in this vein are the breath of fresh air indie film-making and the horror genre in general could use right now. Truly a film worthy of its cult status.</p></br><a href="../users/A129YBX5BVNW2.html">A129YBX5BVNW2</a><br/><p>*** BLU RAY Version ***<br /><br />Rewatching "Bubba Ho-Tep" is like reliving the first time you saw "The Big Lebowski".

Rock Like An Egyptian - Interview with Brian Tyler who composed the score<br /><br />As I suspected, the lo-fi independent production values of the original 2002 film are ruthlessly exposed by the unforgiving nature of high definition. But I was still more than pleased to find out that there are huge improvements on the BLU RAY print.<br /><br />Most of the movie was shot indoors - his bedroom, the corridors of the home, night scenes outside on the grass lawns (all notoriously hard to get clarity on) - so the vast majority of the print has a slight parlour of blocking. It isn't huge, but it is there. However, once you get to the daylight shots (the grounds of the home in the morning, down by the river, the flashbacks to Elvis' touring past) the picture is great - even beautiful in places. And the close-ups on Campbell's heavily made-up face do now reveal just a little too many make-up lines you couldn't see before - so you know the BLU RAY is working. For me the clarity is upped a great deal - it's just worth pointing out that some might find it a little underwhelming.<br /><br />So why is Bubba Ho-Tep so much fun - even poignant? A lot of the credit has to go to Bruce Campbell's performance as an aged Elvis trapped in a Texas retirement home after a 20-year coma. He is extraordinary in the part - his mannerisms, the voice, the silly karate-kick gestures, lusting after young babes with a Johnson that hasn't been functional since the passing of too many Presidents. Campbell somehow makes Elvis real. This is how The King Of Rock 'n' Roll would be thinking, ruminating on life, trying to push himself and his spirit back to its former greatness (title above). And of course Campbell's "King" taps into our almost irrational love of Elvis Presley no matter how ludicrous he looked or became. Credit should also go to Brian Tyler's guitar strum soundtrack, which adds so much to the overall vibe and giggle-factor.<br /><br />Also running alongside Campbell is a wonderfully wry performance by Ella Joyce as "The Nurse" who gets to massage more than Aaron's ego. Even better is veteran actor Ossie Davis as a black man who is convinced that he's "JFK" abducted by aliens and with part of his brain replaced with a sack of sand. The fact that 'Jack' makes most sense about the Mummy stalking the rooms of their Mud Creek home in cowboy boots sucking the souls out of weak inmates through their ass as they sleep and writing Egyptian graffiti on toilet walls - is perhaps a tad worrying...<br /><br />As you can gather from the above, Bubba Ho-Tep also has one of the most fantastically inventive and witty storylines ever. It was adapted from Texas born Joe Lansdale's short story by Director Don Coscarelli and most of the dialogue virtually screams instant cult classic. Just like "The Big Lebowski", you'll find yourself quoting it line for line at work...<br />"How could my plans have gone so wrong? And when are they going to serve lunch?"<br />"One glimpse of her panties and I felt my heart flutter...like a pigeon having a heart attack..."<br />And there's plenty more where they came from.<br /><br />How could the King Of Rock 'n' Roll have gone from having knickers thrown at him on stage to being marooned in a godforsaken Texan retirement home with a growth of his pecker and his shades semi-intact?<br />How did Elvis leave the building and what did the Egyptian hieroglyphics in the sky tell him when he did?<br />Will Priscilla still want him or will they have to 'talk' about it?<br />And in the end is there anything more to life than food, s**t and sex?<br /><br />Buy or rent "Bubba Ho-Tep" on BLU RAY now and find out.<br /><br />And I truly envy you the journey...<br /><br />PS: "Bubba Nosferatu - Curse Of The She-Vampires" is due in 2011 - can't wait!</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>I must admit right off the top that I've never been a big Bruce Campbell fan at all.I have found his acting to be pedestrian at best with just one or two "tricks" he invariably uses in every role he plays.This role however has made me rethink Bruce Campbell and his abilities.<br />Bruce plays an aging Elvis who has wound up in a nursing home,wondering where his life all went wrong and what the heck that "thing" is on his,er well,private parts! He shows a great range in his portrayal here and he leaves you convinced he is "The King".<br />He becomes a reluctant ally with another nursing home inhabitant by the name of John Kennedy,the past president.This role is played beautifully by veteran actor Ossie Davis who also convinvces you,skin colour included,that he is who he portrays.<br />Both find themselves pitted against a mummy who is using this seniors home as a "feeding" ground for collecting souls.A Fox who has had free reign in the proverbial henhouse,you might say, until he is found out and comes up against two decrepit but committed post-famous geriatrics.<br />The film is,when all said and done,a battle of good-against-evil thriller with some wonderful and original twists but there is something else.The thread of life in nursing homes and just how seniors are treated by staff and visitors alike winds its' uncomfortable way through this picture meshing in well with on going events.At times though it almost threatens to slow the pace and narrative up but there is enough of the major theme to keep it rolling steadily along.<br />This movie is one that just does not rush itself.It has a story to tell you,events and people that it wants you to come to know and when the payoff comes around everything ends well and as it should.Patience is the key word here but it pays off in spades.Special mention also goes to the roles of Elvis'nurse and to the two undertakers who have a running gag throughout the film.<br />I recommend this movie highly.Kudos to Mr Davis and especially a tip of the derby to Mr Campbell who does a surprisingly expert job in his portrayal here.A deliberately paced horror flick with some wonderful and surprisingly original twists on an old theme.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EGDRTJYF3AZK.html">A1EGDRTJYF3AZK</a><br/><p>Elvis and a black J.F.K in a texas retirement home fighting off a soul sucking mummy?! That is why Bruce Campbell didn't get nominated for an oscar;to off the wall, well let me tell you something, this is one of the most original movies ever made. Is it horror, drama, or comedy? that is my challenge to you, put your finger on just one of those choices and then let me know what you think. This movie is worth a view you will thank yourself. I work for a video store in Salem,OR and I put my name on this movie recomending it to my customers, meaning I guarentee you will like it or you can make a complaint to my boss, so far I have had no complaints and I don't think I will. You are missing out if you don't try to see this movie, it's not a family movie but if you can go into it with an open mind it is a movie expierience you won't soon forget; and I put my name on that!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>"Bubba Ho-Tep" is one of those movies that defies description or categorization.  A charmingly low-budget effort, it has a razor-thin plot that cannot help but generate laughs -- Elvis (Bruce Campbell) is alive and listlessly waits for death to whisk him away from his bed in a convalescent home in Mud Creek, Texas.  His will to live is restored when Bubba Ho-Tep, an Egyptian mummy in cowboy boots, is discovered dining on the nursing home residents' souls by John F. Kennedy (Ossie Davis), who was "dyed black" and deposited in the home to get him out of the way.  Together, Elvis and JFK will fight off this evil spirit before he can turn the nursing home into his own private soul buffet.  Summarize the plot out loud and try to keep from smiling -- I double-dog dare you.<br /><br />Moving at a glacial pace, "Bubba Ho-Tep" does not even have enough going on to meet 90 minutes of screen time.  This is, oddly, a plus.  Just as some books are more appropriately novellas rather than novels, there is a place for an 85-minute movie -- just so long as they are a good 85 minutes.  (One can find many two-plus-hour movies that would have been much better at 85 minutes!)<br /><br />The joys of this movie start with the script.  This is one funny film!  Told with an obvious affection for The King, a plausible yarn is spun about how Elvis actually switched places with his #1 impersonator prior to his demise, living for years as Elvis impersonating an Elvis impersonator impersonating Elvis.  JFK also works as a character, although Ossie Davis isn't given quite as much to work with in the script, and he inexplicably does not have a Boston Brahmin accent.  Always funny and balancing irreverence with affection, this is a script that will surely place some catch-phrases in the American lexicon.<br /><br />Bruce Campbell inhabits Elvis' decrepit body as if born to the role, down to the feebly serious karate moves and other traditional Elvis cliches.  Ossie Davis, always a pleasure to watch on screen, again personifies dignity, even when surrounded by profound silliness.  How these two actors retained such straight faces throughout the film is a wonder.<br /><br />Every once in a while a movie comes along that defies a ratings system -- even the five-star rating system has limits.  You try to preserve the five-star ratings for awesome, terrific, inspiring movies -- it cheapens "Casablanca" if you give a five-star rating to every movie that is merely "really good."  And while "Bubba Ho-Tep" does not rise to the level of a five-star film, one must ask how it could have been much better than it is.  Two excellent performances, a wickedly-funny script, and purposefully-campy special effects make "Bubba Ho-Tep" a true comic gem that may not find itself on the American Film Insitute Top 100 (of anything), but it is one heck of a funny little film, and well worth your attention.  Destined to be a cult classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Elvis Presley is still alive, didn't you know? He's working as an autobody repairman in a small town outside of Mobile, Alababma.  He's runs a small airport in southern Alaska and gives flyover tours of the state. He bags groceries at a small grocery store in Montana, is married, and has 13 children. He works as a limo chauffer in Hollywood. He's impersonating himself in Vegas. Some Elvis fans just can't accept the fact the Elvis Presley, America's only real King of Music, is dead.  Of course, some people still have a hard time believing that John F. Kennedy died. There's all kinds of stories that the assasination was just a huge government cover-up for a massive conspiracy, either extraterrestial or otherwise.  Kennedy was young, handsome, and sauve. He came from a prominent family and was married to a beautiful wife. He was the youngest person ever elected President of the United States and also the youngest to die. Elvis and JFK are the closest individuals that America has ever had to royalty.  But what if some of the conspiracy theories were true?<br /><br />That possibilty is the foundation for BUBBA HO-TEP.  Most simply put, the movie is an Elvis redemption story. The film opens with Elvis lying in his bed at a retirement home in Mud Creek, Texas. He's got cancer on his penis and not too much longer to live. He ended up in Mud Creek because thirty years earlier, he pulled a Prince and the Pauper with a look alike out in Nevada. The King needed to get away for awhile and get back in touch with the simpler things in life.  The only problem was that the look alike was a druggy and died before they had the chance to switch back. Things got even worse several years later while the King was performing a tribute concert to himself and he pulled his hip out of wack on stage. He never was able to recover and without any friends or family he could call on, he eventually found himself living in the Shady Rest retirement home in Mud Creek, Texas.<br /><br />As time passes by, Elvis begins to realize that there's something fishy going on at Shady Rest. Turns out there's a mummy living around the home who can suck human souls. The mummy needs the souls to survive. A young soul would bring him completely back to life, but there aren't any young souls at Shady Rest. So, Bubba Ho-Tep, lives like a virus, sucking out a soul whenever he needs to and no one is the wiser. Except the King and JFK.<br /><br />That's right JFK.  John Kennedy is the newest resident of Shady Rest. He's in a wheelchair, has a hole in his head that he claims is filled with sand, and is black.  He tells Elvis that the government died him black to keep him in hiding. The story sounds far fetched, but Kennedy knows an awful lot about JFK and he really does have a hole in his head.  Anyway, Elvis and JFK join forces to bring down Bubba Ho-Tep once and for all and stop the soul sucking and killing.<br /><br />BUBBA HO-TEP has some great acting. Bruce Campbell is perfect for the role of Elvis as is the legendary Ossie Davis as JFK. Like the men they portray, these two actors have had two completely different and varied careers. However, together they form an unbelievably talented acting duo. The story is intriguing.  There isn't a whole lot of violence and the things that are seen are tastefully done.  The movie had a very low budget and many things in the film came about because of called- in favors and so forth. The only thing in the movie that bothered me a little were the constant references to Mr. Presley's gentitals.  I understand why some of the refrences are needed, but at times it was just too much.<br /><br />Though BUBBA HO-TEP is a buddy picture and is classified as horror it is also a semi-battle picture mixed in with a little bit of "grand journey-ness". However, ultimately the film is an Elvis Presley redemption story.  According to the film, Presley made a lot of mistakes in his life (especially the big switch) and has squandered much of his time. The movie allows him to redeem himself and become the man he once was and was always meant to be.<br /><br />The DVD includes several features. There's the usual director commentary (this one has Bruce Campbell along for the ride as well), a commentary by The King himself (which is hilarious), a reading of the original short story the movie is based on by the author of the story, a few deleted scenes, several behind the scenes featurettes, a music video, some photo stills, the original theatrical trailer, and a few other items. Not including the commentaries and the story reading, it only takes about 85 minutes to get through all the other extras. It's pretty good quality stuff and watching it gives one a good idea about how creative the filmmakers were considering the limited budget.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NOZB6VZCTOI4.html">A2NOZB6VZCTOI4</a><br/><p>I bought this movie, because the premise seemed so totally outlandish to me I just had to know what secrets it held. This is one of my favorite movies in a long time. It is definitely my favorite horror movie to date. I won't give away too much of the plot, as it is so delicious you need to watch it unfold in front of you with no preconceptions. Suffice it to say that Elvis is still alive and living in a nursing home in Texas with JFK. Due to a quirky turn of fate the two of them team up and battle an Egyptian mummy in an amazing battle of wits that is metaphorically a battle of good versus evil. There are many unusual twists and turns in the plot, but I was greatly heartened by the ending.<p>Bruce Campbell is Elvis in the movie. When I say he is Elvis, I mean he IS Elvis. He is wonderful as the elderly crabby Elvis and makes the film the success it is. The other lead role, that of President Kennedy (who is alive, but has a sandbag placed in part of his head) is played by the gifted Ossie Davis, a wonderful actor, who, if you don't know, is black (They dyed me this color!) These two become friends at the depressing nursing home, where they are patronized by the staff incessantly. <p>Perhaps I should have titled the review &quot;Elvis and JFK Battle a Mummy Texas Style,&quot; but this really is mostly a story of redemption. Eventually Elvis and JFK realize that they are the only ones able to conquer the mummy and it gives them a reason to live, and in the end, redemption. This brings up my very favorite point about this film. It is wonderful seeing two elderly heroes in this movie. In a society where so many of our elderly are invisible and the entire culture is youth-obsessed it was a brilliant masterstroke to show the value of our elders by making them the heroes. In real life Bruce Campbell is not elderly (he had lots of makeup), but Ossie Davis really is 83, and still looks great. <p>There are many moments of humor in the film, my favorite of which is when Elvis and JFK discover hieroglyphics written on a bathroom stall wall that JFK translates as &quot;Pharaoh gobbles donkey goobers; Cleopatra does the nasty.&quot; There are also bizarre fight scenes, such as when Elvis takes on the giant flying scarab beetle with some karate moves and a bedpan. There are other cool effects such as when the mummy 'speaks' in amusing hieroglyphics and the stars move to spell out a message to Elvis in the end. The mummy himself is very well done, and very creepy. This movie has something for everyone, and I recommend it highly. If I could change one thing it would be a bit of the sporadically bad language, although it is basically used to reinforce the crankiness of the two title characters.<p>The extras on the DVD are compendious, and well worth watching. There are commentary tracks (including one by Elvis!), and 'making of' type documentaries, which you need to watch. It is fabulous that they made such an original and worthwhile movie on such a low budget. I will watch for more from Don Coscarelli and the other makers of this mind-altering film.<p>Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/AAKGTWGAFT1LQ.html">AAKGTWGAFT1LQ</a><br/><p>I think BUBBA HO TEP is a serious film pretending to be a comedy / horror film .<br /><br />Without being silly about it , the film is all about the danger of people's souls being lost . That can have a double meaning after seeing the film .<br /><br />It will also confront you if you are in the mood , as getting old is a major plot point and something most of us don't like to think about - it's like we think getting old happens to other people .<br /><br />It has a clever story and acting that makes you take that story at face value . Don't let the weird plot stop you from seeing this great film !</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>The idea here is quite simple. Elvis (Bruce Campbell) is not dead; he switched over with an Elvis impersonator and was living a carefree life (as an Elvis impersonator) when he broke his hip. Now he is in a rest home in East Texas, concerned with an abnormality on a particular part of his anatomy, and hobbling around on a walker. But then giant scarab beetles start showing up and he learns from John F. Kennedy (Ossie Davis), who is also in the rest home, having been dyed black by the assassination conspiracy, that there is an ancient Egyptian soul sucking mummy named Bubba Ho-Tep killing off the members of their less than happy little home. <p>Is it really Elvis? After all, it is not really JFK. But then there really is a Bubba Ho-Tep, so at least it is a fifty-fifty proposition. If only there had not been that barbeque accident that destroyed the only proof Elvis had in his possession about the switch. But the important thing is that this 2002 film works either way. When Elvis talks about his regrets over running out on Priscilla and Lisa Marie or about how bad his films were, there is some resonance. Besides, there is something heroic about the King heading out to do battle with a mummy puffing along behind his walker while JFK zips along in his motorized wheelchair. <p>Campbell's performance as the aged and infirmed Elvis avoids caricature; the accent is never laid on too thick, which is key. Like the short story by Joe R. Lansdale on which it is based, this film from director Don Coscarelli has an affection for the character of Elvis. The point was not that Elvis disappeared, but that by pretending to be an Elvis impersonator he could perform without having to put up with the rest of the circus (it reminds me of the Elvis from his television comeback special, where he sits in a circles with the guys playing his guitar and singing his music, long before the became the bloated figure in the white star spangled jump suit). <p>You keep thinking that &quot;Bubba Ho-Tep&quot; is going to be a camp horror movie, but it does not go this way. Yes, this film is actually on the conservative side of things like &quot;Men in Black,&quot; which had tongues more prominently in cheeks. But then these two old codgers have lots of problems besides the soul-sucking mummy and this film ends with a knock down drag out fight between our heroes and the title character. Campbell and Davis take their characters serious, as does the film, and that is why it works as well as it does, which is a lot better than you would ever think. At the very least, you have to celebrate the film's audacity and say, as would the King: &quot;Thank you. Thank you very much.&quot;<br /><br /> As you would expect the extras on this DVD are above average. You have two commentary tracks, the first by Coscarelli and Campbell, with the second being by &quot;The King.&quot; Lansalde reads from his original story and you also get theatrical trailers and TV spots, deleted scenes, and several featurettes.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Bubba Ho-Tep (Don Coscarelli, 2002)<p>How is it possible to not like this movie? Bruce Campbell (The Evil Dead) plays Elvis, who switched places with an Elvis impersonator, intending to reclaim the throne after he'd had a breath of fresh air, but the impersonator topped himself. Ossie Davis (no introduction necessary) is John F. Kennedy, forced into obscurity by a government plot and dyed black to stop anyone from recognizing him. The two of them have to stop a thousands-year-old mummy who's taken up residence at their rest home in order to feed on the energy of the dying. Based on a story by Joe R. Lansdale (The Two-Bear Mambo, Act of Love, etc.) and written and directed by Don Coscarelli (only his third big-screen offering outside the Phantasm dynasty in the past twenty-five years). I mean, you can't go wrong.<p>Not to say the movie doesn't have problems. The more surreal the script, the better Coscarelli works with it (witness the brilliance of the original Phantasm, one of the finest horror movies of all time); conversely, the more "real" a script is, well, the less it ends up working. (Phantasm III, for example, with its long, slow stretches of exposition.) Coscarelli has gotten better at same over the years; what the movie is really about is Elvis and JFK, and how two guys who are both certifiable bond in the face of a crisis. There's still loads of exposition, but it moves by more quickly than usual with Coscarelli. Campbell and Davis seem to work well together, though the two of them don't really have the chemistry to make the bond believable.<p>That can be overlooked with the acting talent in here. Aside from Davis and Campbell, there are wonderful minor roles offered up by Ella Joyce (of Roc fame), Reggie Bannister (Phantasm), Heidi Marnhout (Phantasm IV), Daniel Roebuck (who may do many things, but will always be remembered as the murderer in River's Edge), and Bob Ivy as The Beaver... erm, Bubba Ho-Tep (continuing the "let's cast a stuntman as the monster" phase in horror films). The dialogue is quick, witty, and just this side of completely off the wall (as is to be expected from Mr. Lansdale). It's got all the hallmarks of really good low-budget horror.<p>But the real treat here is in the DVD extras. Loads of commentary, a couple of mini-docos, the "Brian Tyler plays everything" music video (Tyler, a new wunderkind whose credits include Darkness Falls, Frailty, and Vampires: Los Muertos, about which the music was the only decent thing, looks startlingly enough like Lansdale I thought he was the one playing the instruments), Joe Lansdale reading a piece of the original story (with the accompanying bits of film relevant), and more. A lovely treatment that more films should get. *** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A8DI0COTCMRDV.html">A8DI0COTCMRDV</a><br/><p>one of the greatest movies ever made for absolute sure!!!!!!!! im not even going to bother saying much else except the dvd package for a first release is GREAT!!!!!!! its got a bunch of neat little extras &amp; a limited edition booklet inside. &amp; TO &quot;SINISTERFEIND&quot; OR WHATEVER just because your stuck on 1 or 2 genre's, wich obviously makes you not appreciate an all around good movie doesn't mean you have to destroy a movie this GREAT in your review!?!?!? you are completely giving the rest of the amazon customers the wrong idea!!! its one thing to say you didn't like the movie that much &amp; that its not &quot;army of darkness&quot; its another thing though to bash it &amp; say that BRUCE CAMPBELL (&quot;)(un&quot;) just ended his career!!?????????????

Davis plays a JFK who was dyed black by LBJ after the assassination &quot;attempt&quot; in Nov 1963.  The movie is told from &quot;Elvis'&quot; perspective so he believes in himself (but has doubts about JFK) For us both possibilities would seem unlikely, as is the chance of both the King and the President being in the same nursing home in East Texas in 2002.  The film leaves us to decide that.<p>  However it is even more unlikely that an undead Egyptian Mummy is sucking the souls of dead people at the nursing home while writing graffiti on the bathroom walls in hieroglyphics.  Of this the film leaves no doubt.  Since this is even less likely then the Elvis &amp; Kennedy bit it all ends up working smashingly.<p>  We see Elvis reflect on his life, we see time dash by without change until Elvis manages to fight off an attack by the calling card of the Mummy.  <p>  As he becomes useful again his self respect returns and both old men resolve to defend the only home they have.<p>  The film make good use of the supporting cast particularly Ella Joyce as the nurse.  It also plays all the characters seriously.  The battle between the Mummy and our heroes is very much a fight between an undead creature and two very old men and is played totally straight.  <p>  This movie works on every level, Campbell should have gotten a nomination for this role.  It's one of the best movies you will have never seen.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Bruce Campbell as the King? Stranger things could happen (and have). Campbell, King of the B (and sometimes Z)movie, frequent television guest star and all around Chin that can kill gives a very funny performance as Elvis in a film that puts &quot;Van Helsing&quot; and other wanna-be camp-fests to shame. Directed by Don Coscarelli (&quot;Phantasm&quot;), &quot;Bubba Ho-Tep&quot; has the tone of a Coehn brothers film with the perfect over-the-top story.<p>Elvis isn't dead. He just went to a rest home. The whys and wherefores of this departure are discussed in the very funny voice over narration. Most importantly Elvis hooks up with JFK. Yes, JFK didn't die. He was also put into a rest home for national security. After having half his brain removed and being died black to protect his identity. Turns out these two American icons must fight a soul-sucking zombie in Texas. Oh, and the zombie dresses as a cowboy.<p>It also has its serious moments but luckily the soul sucking and crime fighting are the major attractions here. Picture quality looks really, really good and there's loads of extras. Audio commentary by Campbell, Coscarelli and the &quot;King&quot;. We also have four featurettes, deleted scenes, photo gallery, original theatrical trailer, TV spot, the writer of the short story that inspired this Joe Lansdale reading from his story. Oh, let's not forget the music video. That's worth the price of admission alone. <p>Anyhow, there's quite a bit of good storytelling here and this film is loads of fun much like Sam Raimi's &quot;Evil Dead&quot; films.

Elvis and a black man who believes that he is JFK battle a soul-sucking mummy in a Texas nursing home.<br />Horror purists have given this mixed reviews, and most fans of the mostly pathetic mainstream comedies will probably find it too &quot;weird.&quot; So, I'll just go ahead and classify this as drama.<br />Sue me.<br />The dvd contains some insightful commentary by Bruce Campbell and the director. What I really dug was the extra they had in which the author of the short story reads the first chapter. I am going to go back and find that author's name and seek out his work, from what I could tell, he writes wickedly.<br />Even if the premise sounds ridiculous, I believe that this film can be interpretted in different ways. It shows the horrors of growing old, and becoming forgotten in this country, and yet is also a tribute to the true American Spirit- bravery and loyalty and virtue.<br />Ask not what your nursing home can do for you...</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>Man, what a great flick this is. It's so refreshing to see a good movie these days that keeps you interested from start to finish and is also a horror movie that doesnt involve snot nosed teenager's from todays "flavour of the month" catagories.<br /><br />Plot<br /><br />This movie is about Elvis Presley. And yes, it is present day! What's happend is back in the 70's, Elvis was fed up with his life, he had lost his wife, didnt see his kid much and it depressed him that his fame was so big yet he felt so small. So he goes and meet's with the best Elvis impersinator in America and offers to switch lives with him. They sign a contract that if Elvis ever wanted to be Elvis again, they other guy would have to switch. But 2 things go wrong, 1 Elvis (real one) accidently burns his contract in a BBQ accident! And the fake one ended up having a heart attack and thats the story everyone knows.<br /><br />Now, Elvis is living in a retirment home in Texas. He just so happens to share the same retirment home that the Loan Ranger and JFK, both in there geratric years. Whats even funnier is JFK is now a black man (Ossie Davis)! (see the movie for his excuse why, it's hillarious)<br /><br />If that part of the story hasnt intreaged you enough, then get aload of the plot.<br /><br />Elvis and JFK are on the case to put an end to a soul stealing mummy originaly from Egypt who walks the halls at night looking for souls to keep him around. Also side stories like Elvis personal problem and how no one beleives he's Elvis is funny as hell.<br /><br />This movie is top notch...

Where does the King of Rock and Roll fit in to that scenario?<br /><br />It seems those tabloid headlines are true: Elvis didn't die on that muggy summer day in 1977. Weary of fame, he traded places with one of his better impersonators. It was the impersonator who died, and since the contract the real Elvis signed with his replacement was destroyed in a fire during a barbecue at the trailer park where the King was residing, there was no way back into his old life. After his hip goes out during a performance ("I was gyratin', takin' care of business"), he ends up at the Shady Rest where no one believes him when he says he's Elvis, certainly not Ella Joyce's condescending nurse.<br /><br />But one resident does believe him. Why wouldn't he? "John F. Kennedy" is the victim of equally bizarre circumstances. He is also presumed dead, but it turns out his 1963 assassination was staged, and the president's skin dyed black to keep the truth from coming to the surface.<br /><br />Elvis is skeptical, but, hey, why not accept what "Jack" says, especially since "JFK" is the only one hip to what's happenin' at the rest home? Together these two now aged and slow moving icons battle the mummy.<br /><br />"Bubba Ho Tep" is frequently hilarious, yet it never mocks Elvis or JFK. It treats both of these giants with reverence, and when it comes to the King, Coscarelli and star Bruce Campbell show real insight into Presley's life and career. As Elvis flips through channels on the TV set, he stumbles upon a marathon of his own movies and laments that none of them were any good. "Colonel Parker was a shark and a fool," he says, "and I was a bigger fool for following him." The need to compensate for the mistakes he made in his career gives Elvis the push he needs to risk all and take on the mummy.<br /><br />Coscarelli and his cast beat all the odds by making this deranged nonsense work. Campbell is exceptional as Elvis, and Ossie Davis makes for a very dignified JFK.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>To say this is a Bruce Campbell movie will suffice as a review for the "chinned one's" fans.  To clarify further - Bruce stars as a rest home-bound "Elvis Presley" in a battle against a 4000 year old mummy.  Whether Elvis is really Elvis (the victim of an identity switcharoo with an Elvis impersonator) or a senile old Elvis impersonator who took his gig too far, is left for the audience to decide.  Joining Elvis in his battle is "JFK" - another rest home resident.  When it's pointed out to Jack that he is black, he doesn't miss a beat: "They dyed me this colour!  J. Edgar Hoover and his boys!"<br /><br />If this sounds absurd, well, it is!  But it's cheerfully absurd.  Elvis is a convalescent who regains his interest in life when he notices the mystery of the mummy (from the Ho-Tep dynasty).  Campbell delivers cheesy lines as only he can (in a passable Elvis accent).  The key to the film is that everyone plays their parts absolutely straight, including the director.  This may be a bit off-putting to those unfamiliar with Campbell's work.  I think, though, if you go into the movie with no preconceived notions (because the film defies genres), you will quickly catch on and enjoy yourself for 90 minutes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it never quite elevates itself to a true classic in the horror-slash-something-else style.  Evil Dead 2 is gruesomely funny because it goes all the way - it's pure horror with an overarching absurd sense of humour.  The same cannot be said of Bubba Ho-Tep, which suffers too many fits and starts at the beginning.  Is it drama-comedy?  Horror-comedy?  Satire?  Horror with low bathroom comedy (Elvis has a growth on his nether region that gets a lot of discussion early on)? In the first 30 minutes, it is all these things, and therefore none of them.<br /><br />These traits would be forgivable if the movie would just go all the way.  Campbell's portrayal of Elvis, as well as some of the supporting players, finds the correct tone.  Unfortunately, the JFK character does not.  If you are going to have someone think they're JFK, go all the way!  Have him talk about Jacki and Bobby. Shouldn't he be resentful that Jacki married a Greek billionaire?  Shouldn't he lament the state of his family - playboys with no interest in politics getting arrested for stupid pranks?  Another near-fatal flaw is the lack of any singing by Elvis.  A movie on this budget could not afford Elvis songs.  Fair enough, but the Sledgehammer (TV) show "All Shook Up" by-passed this by using non-proprietary Elvis songs, like his gospel stuff.  I put this to the viewer: wouldn't the movie have had an added dimension of surreality if Elvis had been singing gospel or Christmas songs?<br /><br />These flaws are not fatal, but detract from the overall enjoyment of the film and lower my ranking to 3/5 stars.  The DVD itself is about what you'd expect for an independent film.  There are a number of deleted scenes and some making-of features that are interesting and worth the watch.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>When I popped this DVD into my player, I was looking forward to 90 minutes of Sam Raimi-ish horror comedy.  To my surprise, this movie ended up being a character study of an elderly Elvis (maybe) and an elderly black JFK (possibly).  Characterization is usually completely lacking in the horror genre, and I welcome any attempt to flesh out the characters in this type of movie.  But the characterization ended up being tedious and repetitive in parts.  Indeed, this movie slows to a crawl in more than one location.  And ultimately, a movie about Elvis and JFK fighting a mummy in a rest home should never get tedious.  Unfortunately, this movie never quite goes over the top in the way that you'd expect based on the subject matter.<p>Fans of Bruce Campbell will enjoy his excellent (as always) performance.  And no one will be disappointed by the copious extras on this DVD.  For those with surround sound, the sound mix on this disc is first-rate, as well.</p></br><a href="../users/AWPODHOB4GFWL.html">AWPODHOB4GFWL</a><br/><p>Bruce Campbell (Evil Dead I and II) plays the real Elvis Presley in a Texas nursing home after he decides to change his identity to an Elvis impersonator.  His buddy is a black dude who claims to be JFK who survived the Dallas assassination.  After scientists uncover a mummy in Egypt and transfer it to the USA for a tour, the bus carrying it accidentally drives off a bridge into a river near the nursing home.  Leave it to Elvis and JFK to kill the soul sucking mummy who is out to kill everyone to survive.  Its complete camp and over the top.  At first reading, I thought this might be fun, but it?s a sophomoric attempt at gallows humor with some (actually) funny foul-mouthed humor.  For under age twenty-five only.  Enjoy.<br /><br />There are tons of extra features, but for the life of me I don't know why.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>After viewing the trailer for this movie and reading some of the advanced reviews, I was expecting a great film.  BUBBA HO TEP, directed by PHANTASM'S Don Coscarelli, unfortunately, is not a great flick.<br />Bruce Campbell is amazingly perfect in the role of Elvis Presley/Sebastian Haff.  According to storywriter Joe R. Lansdale, Presley switched places with one of his impersonators, so that it was really Haff who died and not Presley.  Presley continued to play the impersonator until he fell off the stage, injured his hip and ended up in a nursing home.  Campbell's transformation transcends the good make-up job; Campbell gets the intonations down, the sneer, the embodiment of the tortured Elvis psyche.  It's probably his most consistently good performance.<br />Ossie Davis does well as Presley's buddy---a black man who says he is John F. Kennedy.  They &quot;dyed&quot; him and keep his brain active with a battery that's located in Washington, DC.  They form an uneasy alliance, as Kennedy thinks just maybe Presley knew about the Dallas assassination.<br />Meanwhile, these geriatric sleuths find themselves battling an ancient Egyptian mummy who sends scarab beetles out to his victims.  Some of the effects are excellent and Presley's nailing of the beetle in his bedpan is hilarious.  The mummy himself, played by Bob Ivy, is a Freddy clone who ultimately just isn't frightening.<br />There's a lot of pontification from Presley on how he has ruined his life, but at the same time, he somewhat enjoys his alter ego.  Coscarelli's downfall is that while we understand we have geriatric heroes, his slow pacing doesn't help the suspense scenes out at all.  The fiery climax is ultimately unsatisfying because it burns itself out.<br />BUBBA HO TEP deserves praise for its unique subject matter, Lansdale proving what an unusual horror writer he is, and of course for the outstanding job Campbell does.  I just wanted more!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>Bruce Campbell and Ossie Davis, as Elvis Presley, and JFK respectively, do their best to lift a script with more holes than a block of swiss cheese, in this low grade Indy flick from Don Coscarelli. The idea of Elvis being alive and well (having traded places with an impersonator for want of a peaceful life free from the trappings of fame), and ending up dishevelled, and more than a little cynical in a crumbling Texas rest home certainly scores on the originality front, but thats about it really.. The only person who of course believes him is Ossie Davis as the ex president JFK, personified as an old black man, after the government had him "dyed" to aid the cover up, and the two men set about solving a mystery that is claiming the lives of the rest home residents. What could have been an intentionally camp comedy/horror with a side order of pathos, is sadly lacking in too many areas to be memorable. The director has obviously tried to incorporate some poignant drama and side comment about old age, forgotten relatives, and rest homes, but whereas this is a nice idea, it gets lost in the morass of plot ideas that fall over each other throughout the movie. Unlike "Army of Darkness" it's difficult to really catagorize this movie, and as it trys to be too many things, it ends up being none, the comedy aspect tepid and dilute at best. Bubba Hotep is actually a reincarnated Cowboy Mummy roaming the run down halls looking for lost souls after he was stolen from a museum, and the bus he was on crashed in a river near (you guessed it) the rest home where the movie is set. What must have appeared to be a "good idea" on paper, just isn't - the end product is niether scary, tense, or really very funny, and that's a real shame. I desperately wanted to like this movie more, but I have to say they are many many better ways to spend 92 minutes. Quite a lot of extra's on the DVD add some interest, but rent before you buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Yes, it's  a funny premise:  Elvis is living in a nursing home with a resident who thinks he's JFK and another who fancies himself the Lone Ranger.  In the meantime, an ancient Egyptian demon wants to suck the souls out of the old and sickly folks, so it's up to Elvis and Jack to stop the demon.<br />Bruce Campbell and Ossie Davis are great.  But somehow, the story lacks the sense of urgency that a horror tale should have, and although there are many funny lines, it could have been stronger comedically.  The writer/director also seems to borrow heavily from the works of the Raimi brothers and their friends the Coen Brothers instead of being more original.<br />Okay for a few laughs, but not as good as it might have been.</p></br><a href="../users/A185QFJRTB5W93.html">A185QFJRTB5W93</a><br/><p>You just can't take your eyes off this TERRIBLE film.  Are you starved for a dose of Bruce Campbell?  Ok, then you'll be in your glory.  Bruce takes this film to all new levels of, well, who knows what.  Campbell is still fun to watch, and his rendition of The King is flawless.  If it wasn't for his performance, this film would rate only one star.  Campbell saves it...and it achieves a solid two star review.  Horrible in every sense of the word, but, yeah baby, you still wanna watch don't you?  Well, thank you, thank you very much.</p></br><a href="../users/AAECAHBNP1VD2.html">AAECAHBNP1VD2</a><br/><p>First, if you don't recognize that from the gitgo, BHT was intentionally way, way, way over the edge, you'll be bored silly by it. IF ytou do, you'll probably laugh like hell. The thing  is that based on where it is storywise, the slower pacing is often necessary, as is the back story. Campbell and Davis are excellent, and the plot is off-the-wall enough to be captivating in an inexplicable way. The big problem is that once things really get going, the whle thing's over WAY too soon. This could've been a half-hour to 45 minutes longer easily, and it would've added a whole other dimension to things. There were also a few threads that could've been followed a bit more for a small subplot or two. Definitely worth it for the performances, but try to get a used or discounted copy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Bruce Campbell as always is great, and Ossie Davis turns in a good performance as well. Ever ride on an old carnival ride? Wonder if it was going to fall apart while you rode it. It gave you a thrill didn't it? This movie will too. It may be a different approach to horror/comedy but it is definitely fun. Some fans of Bruce Campbell's horror movies may be a little disappointed in this B style movie. It isn't the in your face comedy/horror you would normally expect from Bruce Campbell. After the Evil Dead/Evil Dead 2/Army of Darkness trilogy and some of the TV shows and other parts Bruce Campbell has done some expect a crazy fast paced movie. This movie is not the same kind of comedy. It is more subtle and you must be patient with the slower story development. I enjoyed it myself but it was not quite what some people will expect.<br /><br />Campbell does a great job playing an aged Elvis impersonator. When he is faced with a mummy soul sucker at his retirement home things get strange. Bruce plays Elvis Presley or an impersonator, you have to figure it out. Ossie Davis plays John Kennedy or someone that is nuts, once again you must figure it out. This story concept is great and it is fun working out who Bruce and Ozzie really are throughout the movie. The special effects on the mummy aren't bad and even the back story is great, but the jokes are a bit different. When it is announced this is made by some of the same people that made the Evil Dead movies you might expect this to be a wild and crazy ride. It isn't, so go into it expecting a slower ride and you will enjoy it much more. I'm glad I rented it, it was well worth seeing. I bought a copy because I can see this being fun to watch every Halloween.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>What a yawner this movie was. Elvis, JFK, a mummy; I don't know how you make a boring movie out of that, but they managed.<br /><br />Bruce Campbell plays Elvis as an old man trapped in a nursing home where they think he's just an Elvis impersonator. Ossie Davis plays another resident who believes he is JFK. Elvis and JFK team up to defeat an Egyptian mummy that comes at night to steal the souls of the nursing home patients. I'll give it a star for originality and another because I like Bruce Campbell. You'll never get a crazier plot but they don't do anything with it. The budget must have been non-existent because the makeup is awful, the effects, if you can call them that, are Mystery Science Theater level.<br /><br />It's just one boring scene after another that finally, mercifully, leads to the conclusion that's anticlimactic, poorly staged and ultimately meaningless. There are a few funny lines and moments but not enough. Most of their attempts to be funny were just crude, about the same as an 11 year old boy. A big missed opportunity.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EARN5PUVIF1S.html">A1EARN5PUVIF1S</a><br/><p>This &quot;redemptive Elvis mummy movie&quot; is a cute idea not very well realized.  I think the problem is the script.  The action is kind of plodding (well, you are dealing with two old guys with a walker and wheelchair respectively), and the dialog is lame and vulgar.  In addition, the soundtrack keeps hitting you over the head with the same musical theme, that sounds like something ripped off from Local Hero, or whatever the movie of some years back that Mark Knopfler scored.  Bubba had me looking at my watch after about thirty minutes -- and I wound up returning the video to the rental store without even checking out the deleted scenes.  If the scenes included in the movie are this weak, I have no interest in seeing the ones not deemed even that worthy!  A great waste of the talent of Ossie Davis.  The director Don Toscarelli needs to be advised that writing his own screenplay was NOT the way to save money on this admittedly low-budget production.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>A weird, off-the-wall idea that never really takes off.  Of course, the Presley estate would never allow actual Elvis music to used in this film (it would probably cost five times what went into the film in the first place), so, as far as I'm concerned, ANY film about Elvis without his voice suffers.  That's what made him the King.<br />You could have Elvis battling a mummy AND Martians and, if he sang, people would believe it.  Look at his movies!  The public bought just about all of them when they were released.  Letting Elvis sing would allow anyone watching the film to understand why he was who he was.  (But I can't blame the filmmakers for that because this is a very low-budget film).<p>In the extras, the writer/director admits that, trying to submit BUBBA HOTEP in festivals, he didn't know which genre to label his film.  That's another major problem: it never really decides what it wants to do.  It's never particularly funny and it's never scary.<br />It's not hard to see Bruce Campbell as Elvis and a lot of screen time goes into explaining how the King ended up in a Texas nursing home, but too little time is spent trying to convince us that the great Ossie Davis is JFK.<p>By the time it was over, it felt like a dry curiosity, not a camp classic.<br />And I really wanted it to be camp classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A928WN8NV03WZ.html">A928WN8NV03WZ</a><br/><p>I am giving this three stars for Bruce alone, who shows in force with his normal charisma, timing, and ability to play the most bizarre characters not only in a believable sense but like he was born to play them.<br /><br />He is the perfect elvis.  I can see him in another life being an elvis impersonator.<br /><br />But the movie itself just lost my interest before it was over.  A lot of dialogue and narration that lost my interest before the half way mark.<br /><br />it had all the right elements, just not in the right balance.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E11HKN4IRY09.html">A1E11HKN4IRY09</a><br/><p>With a plotline and cast like this, this one should have been B- movie nirvana.  Unfortunately it is not.  Those seeking the kind of humor/thrills/horror that BRUCE CAMPBELL gave in the EVIL DEAD series will be dissapointed at how BUBBA HO-TEP plays out.  CAMPBELL is, of course, the best thing about this flick playing a retired, over the hill ELVIS who battles an egyptian mummy that is hell bent on sucking the souls out of the rest home resident community where the king is cooling his heels.  Unbelieveably, with all that going on and a short running time (about 85 minutes), the film moves very slowly and is quite boring in parts.  The direction by PHANTASM lenser DON COSCARELLI is choppy and uneven, leaving the story on a whole not that funny, nor scary or thrilling.  The redeemer is CAMPBELL, whose ability to make ELVIS revered whilst scummy is great.  You can tell he's having a blast, playing a sarcastic, yet honest tribute.  CAMPBELL is one of those actors that is just fun to watch, and only in this kind of kooky movie.  Fans of CAMPBELL should enjoy at least one viewing, for BUBBA HO-TEP isn't bad B-movie entertainment, it just isn't that good either.</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>I'm a Bruce Campbell fan. Most people who are reviewing this movie are Bruce Campbell fans. People whop've watched this film have done so for one primary reason; Bruce Campbell. SO why can't we be honest? This movie is lousy.<p>Bruce does a great job as an over the hill Elvis. In fact his acting is probably on par or even surpasses anything he's done in his career, to include Ash. But that in itself does not save this film. The story is boring, the movie is boring, and the ending is very anti-climatic. <p>Bruce spends the first half of the move in bed, this goes along with flashbacks explaining how Elvis Presley is still alive.  Eventually he meets up with a black guy who is in fact JFK (along with a bag of sand replacing part of his missing brain). They try to solve the mystery of giant cockroaches and hyrogryphics in the men's room.<p>The final fight is poorly done, and to be blunt, it's boring. By the time the final showdown comes up, you'll wish the movie would just end. It's bad. Bruce has his moments, but for the most part, even the most die-hard Bruce fan will eventually let this movie collect dust. <p>To sum it up, good acting by all involved working with a lame story.</p></br><a href="../users/ASHT96DUVMF1S.html">ASHT96DUVMF1S</a><br/><p>It's the instant cult classic, a film praised by its strange story and amazing story telling. The film is based on a story by writer Joe R. Lansdale and adapted to screen by director Don Coscarelli.  The main character is played by non other than Evil Dead actor Bruce Campbell and legendary actor Ossie Davis.  Studios ran away from the idea of two old guys in an old folks home fighting an Egyptian Soul Sucker.  Both Campbell's and Davis's agents said it would be a horrible idea to do the film.  Well both the agents and studios were wrong about the film.  Its success takes cult film to a new level.  New York theater lines rapped around entire blocks for its limited release, hard to believe that only 33 prints were originally created.<br /><br />Thanks to this film I got to take a break form the cookie cutter Hollywood factor.  Elvis and JFK fighting a Mummy that sucks souls, that combination makes people turn away.  I say if you are a fan of horror film give it a chance.  Hey if you are a fan of Elvis Bruce Campbell does a really good impersonation.  The movie received a number of awards at lesser known film festival and award ceremonies.  To bad it wasn't given more respect at some larger festival.<br /><br />My reviews do not give away story detail or even summaries but I will say that this is a refreshing movie that brings together what is great in independent film making.  With the  very small budget and favors from some of the most prestigious special effect and custom companies in Hollywood Coscarelli was able to pull off a remarkable film.  How easily he has put to shame movies with ten times the budget or more.  I am completely baffled at how major film companies can trust unknown, director that lack true experience.<br /><br />Well the movie is funny.  Some of the lines caught me off guard.  They contained a dark humor that appealed to my comedy love.  Bruce Campbell is a funny person and no one can doubt that but this role takes his true acting ability coupling it was a perfect role making for one of my favorite movie is the last couple of years.<br /><br />Video<br /><br />Presented in 2.35:1 Widescreen anamorphic  ratio, this print is surprising excellent.  Most independent films will low budget when transferred to DVD give a horrible quality print.  Not with this film.  MGM has taken extreme care to create a DVD that takes advantage of detail, color and black levels.  Some scenes are grainy but most are flawless retaining a great film like quality.  The print does seem to get better as the movie progresses.<br /><br />Audio<br /><br />I think they used the sound field good to give the movie an edge.  There is only a DD 5.1 track on the DVD but it sound really good.  Voice levels are also good without having to play with the volume level like I have found on several DVD purchased recently.  And lastly the music, an original score was created by Brian Tyler.  It is what really brings out the distinct appeal of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>For some reason, I wasn't really looking forward to this film. Considering it's all I've heard for the past couple of months, I was wondering if it would live up to the hype of one person. And since I had no choice, cos they wouldn't watch it alone - they were too scared - I watched it.<p>What surprised me, was for an 'Elvis' film, there were no Elvis songs played and when Elvis turns on the TV and sees the Elvis Presley Movie Marathon, none of the clips are from any of Elvis's movies (I should know, my mum has most of them). For both, the licensing costs would have been too much for the budget, so they showed stock footage. I was disappointed at there being no Elvis songs, but the theme used throughout the film more than makes up for that! That theme is absolutely fantastic, sad and lonely, but also happy at the same time.<p>I wasn't sure about Bruce Campbell as Elvis. I've always seen movies with Kurt Russell, and he did a fine job. I've only seen Brucie in two Evil Dead movies - and managed to fall asleep during the second one - so I wasn't sure what to expect. Although, he is a nice looking guy, and reminds me very much of Jim Carrey in those movies. Plus, he was playing the older, fat Elvis, not the young and cute Elvis. For a guy who's now in his forties, he's no longer young and cute, but by the looks of it, it wasn't all him that was Elvis. There must have been a LOT of padding in there, especially that 9-months pregnant stomach. And Brucie had the voice down pat, and even some of the little moves - although none of the hip swivelling unfortunately! So I was fair away with him as Elvis.<p>Ossie Davis provided some light entertainment as John F. &quot;Jack&quot; Kennedy, who would only answer to Mr. Kennedy most of the time. (And in a very cheap joke, he was &quot;dyed&quot; black) He was hilarious, as he tried to accuse 'Elvis' of knowing Harvey Lee Oswald who 'tried' to kill him. And in his little electric chair he's so funny!<p>This is a terrific movie, despite the lack of Elvis songs. It also makes you think about the whole myth that Elvis is still alive - but not flipping burgers! I loved that whole aspect of the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>Let me say, first of all, that this movie is likely not what you would be expecting.  For a movie with such an extraordinarily odd premise, it isn't really very, I dunno, zany.  It's primarily a comedy, but it still has some genuine attempts at drama, and, as whole, takes itself a lot more seriously than you might imagine.  It's funny, though not riotously so, and has got a whole sorta tone and mood that I really enjoy.  Reviews of this are fairly pointless, I suppose.  If you're a Campbell or Coscarelli fan, you almost certainly want to see it, and if you aren't you probably don't.  But, I like this movie a helluva lot, so I'll go ahead anyway.<br /><br />For those who don't know, the basic plot of 'Bubba Ho-Tep' is this: An aging Elvis and JFK(who happens to be black) are living in an east Texas rest home, which is besieged by a soul-sucking mummy who is dressed up like a cowboy. (Personally, I think we are supposed to believe that Elvis really is him, but that JFK isn't, though you never can tell)  Thus, it pretty much falls into the horror-comedy genre.  It's fairly different from the other films of this sort, as it takes itself more seriously than any of the other films of this sort that I've seen, is not nearly as whacky or over the top as 'Evil Dead II' or 'Dead Alive', isn't as dry and deadpan as 'Re-Animator' (though it's more along those lines), and isn't interested in graphic violence, as are all 3 of those films.  And, when it does get more serious, it generally does so on a more conventional, dramatic level, rather than as a horror film.  Thus, fans of those films are far from guaranteed to like this film,  but most of that group still seems to, and it's nice that it pushes the boundaries of the sub genre a bit.<br /><br />'Bubba Ho-Tep' was directed by Don Coscarelli, the director who no doubt holds the record as the one who has has highest ratio of how many people have actually seen some of his films, versus how many people actually know his name. (He hasn't made many films, but the 'Phantasm' films and 'Beastmaster' have been absolutely all over cable for years and years.)  I've never actually watched 'Beastmaster' in it's entirety, but his real strength in the 'Phantasm' films is his ability to generate atmosphere, which is also his big strength here.  It's almost impossible to describe here, as it was in those other films, but it's really great.  Sorta vaguely surreal, but not wildly so, and wistful and sentimental.  This is greatly helped by the fantastic rock-based score, with a very nice and sad melody.<br /><br />The best moments of this film are both sad and funny, particularly Elvis' sad ruminations on his lost life,  the death of Kemosabe, and the final scene between JFK and Elvis.  Though the humor is derived from the  characters supposed identities, the film isn't condescending or making fun of them, I don't think.  It takes these guys seriously, and likes them. (As do I)  Thematically, the film is concerned with aging and the way that elderly people are ignored and patronized. Normally films of this sort tend to get a bit over-sentimental, but this one counteracts this with a fairly large dose of crude, lowbrow humor, most of which is quite funny, I might add. I don't know if most of this film is exactly laugh out loud funny, but it's all quite amusing, and I can't recall any jokes that really fell flat in a painful way.<br /><br />The film rarely really seems to be trying to be scary, but the horror scenes usually aren't purely parodic, I don't think.  They're just kinda weird, turned on their head, ya know.  And though they aren't scary, and aren't necessarily funny, they are, I dunno, cool. (Well, actually there is a shot of an old woman being dragged from Elvis's room which I find rather creepy, but that's it.)  Lots of people have complained about how Bubba Ho-Tep actually looks, but I think he looks great.  Sure he looks fake and all, but that's how it ought to be, and his whole cowboy outfit and hat is just quite amusing.<br /><br />The acting is spot-on.  Bruce Campbell is great as Elvis.  He's most famous for his physical comedy, which is largely missing here, as he is barely mobile, but he does his whole surly, pseudo-tough guy attitude as well as ever, and with a funny accent, to boot.  Ossie Davis is equally good as JFK.  He stretches the material just far enough to make it as funny as it can be, but restrained enough that he still seems like he believes what he's saying, and is still a real person.(If a most likely very delusional one.)  The supporting roles are all strong as well, though no one else has all that big of a part.<br /><br />The DVD is also quite nice.  The Campbell/Coscarelli was fairly interesting, and the documentaries I watched were more interesting than most.  There's also a commentary track by Campbell, as Elvis.  I haven't actually listened to it, but it sounds fairly intriguing.<br /><br />Well, that's it.  You already know if you wanna see this, so go ahead.</p></br><a href="../users/AEVNUEDRGTC4P.html">AEVNUEDRGTC4P</a><br/><p>Bubba Ho-Tep is a hilarious movie featuring a still alive Elvis Presley who teams up with a lunatic who believes that he is John F.

One of the more interesting aspects of this movie is the fact that Elvis feels guilty for having exchanged places with an Elvis impersonator so that he could live a normal life.  <p>This is a really funny movie.  Led by veteran B-movie actor Bruce Campbell as Elvis, the cast as a whole delivers a consistently strong performance.  Of all the horror parodies that I have seen, this is one of the very best.</p></br><a href="../users/ANOAF9M5MTJHN.html">ANOAF9M5MTJHN</a><br/><p>well this is a new twist on elvis presily and the mummy. i started watching this and it was weird to me but after a while it becomes good if you keep up with the story line and the actor of elvis does great job. it is a good four star.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Bubba Ho-Tep is based on a short story by Joe R. Lansdale featuring two main characters that are cultural icons and a mummy. Obviously, this is not your typical Hollywood movie. Bubba Ho-Tep is a movie with a beyond-minuscule budget that has gained quite a cult following over the last 6 years. I didn't love the movie, but I found it hard not to admire it.<br /><br />Bruce Campbell plays Elvis Presley, a resident at an East Texas nursing home. Of course, no one believes that he's Elvis because Elvis is dead. Years earlier, weary of fame, Elvis traded places with an impersonator under the condition that he could return to his real life whenever he wished. Unfortunately, all of his documentation was lost in a barbecue accident and now he's just a delusional old guy with a growth in a rather unfortunate area. Another resident is John F. Kennedy (the wonderful Ossie Davis) who claims his assassination was staged by Lyndon Johnson and he was dyed as a result. After scarab beetles are found wandering the nursing home, the two men discover that a soul-sucking Egyptian mummy is afoot.<br /><br />From it's opening title card (providing us with amusing definitions of both "bubba" & "Ho-tep") to it's final scene, Bubba Ho-Tep is a ridiculous, yet amusing B-movie.<br /><br />The film is directed by Don Coscarelli, better known for his four Phantasm films. Here, he's made a unique and meditative horror-comedy that, love it or hate it, is unlike anything you've ever seen.<br /><br />Calling it a horror-comedy isn't quite appropriate. This is a film that really struggles to fit into one particular genre, especially as it's not horrific enough to be a horror film nor is it funny enough to be a comedy.<br /><br />If it's story and execution doesn't appeal to your cinematic palette, it's hard not to appreciate Bruce Campbell's performance, as he completely disappears into his role as Elvis. Casting is pivotal in a movie like this and miscasting could've taken away all credibility from the film. Campbell doesn't just make you believe that he believes he's Elvis but that he IS Elvis.<br /><br />Bubba Ho-Tep is not perfect and how can it be? It has Elvis and JFK battling a mummy, but it has real talent both behind and in front of the camera. There certainly needs to be a substantial amount of suspended disbelief going into this movie to really enjoy it; but Bubba Ho-Tep is charming and completely unlike anything I've ever seen. I recommend it, but be aware of what you're getting yourself into.<br /><br />GRADE: B-</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>Yes, the ending is less-than-satisfying, but Bruce Campbell and Ossie Davis are the film's saviors. Campbell does a deadly accurate impersonation of THE KING, making the viewer feel as though it might be possible that the Presley is alive somewhere in a nursing home in Texas. Legendary acting veteran Ossie Davis, known mostly for his dramatic roles, jumps headlong into his part as a resident that believes that he is JFK. Before the movie ends, you'll be thinking it, too.<br /><br />While the sfx and monster makeup were obviously shot on a shoestring budget, the exemplary script and dialog make up for the former shortcomings. <p>And the slight, but oh-so-recognizable &quot;jabs&quot; at the bigger budgeted &quot;The Mummy&quot; are quite entertaining. <p>This is &quot;B-movie&quot; that deserves an &quot;A&quot; for ingenuity and originality.<br />.</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>Bubba Ho-Tep by Director Don Coscarelli (Phantasm and Beastmaster) is one of those films that has cult favorite placed on it right off the bat. The film sure deserves all the praise it has been getting. I saw the film again on dvd and I have to admit that I liked it even more this second time around.<br /><br /> The film stars Bruce &quot;God&quot; Campbell as a 70 year-old Elvis Presley who is now stuck in an East Texas nursing home. He and an aging black man who thinks he is JFK (just the explanation of why both leads think they are who they are is worth watching the film) must find and destroy a 4,000 year-old cowboy hat and boot wearing Egyptian mummy who has been terrorizing their nursing home.<br /><br /> Bubba Ho-Tep has the low-budget look to it, but its excellence is in its wry, witty dialogue and the sentimentality that comes off the script by Coscarelli off of a Joe Lansdale short story of the same title. This film also has to be Campbell's best work to date --- yes even better than his turn as Ash in the Evil Dead trilogy. His performance as an aging Elvis could've been phoned in and be so hammy and still be ok, but he takes the role seriously with just enough of the King's mannerisms without going into the territory of mocking. Ossie Davis as JFK is also excellent. These two actors hold the film together in-between shots of the mummy where all they do is talk.<br /><br /> For fans of Bruce Campbell, this is a must-see film and for those who just like fine filmmaking then I would suggest they find this film and check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>A nursing home resident who believes he's Elvis (played by Bruce Campbell) must convince another resident (played by Ossie Davis) who believes he's JFK (Lyndon B. Johnson apparantly had the CIA dye him black so no one would recognize him) to team up and battle a lifeforce-sucking mummy Elvis believes is haunting the resting home.  Take That, all you who say there are no original ideas left for movies!<br /><br />  How does one go about elaborating on this further?  First of all, although it has a lot of horror movie elements, it's not really a horror movie itself, although it shares enough of a border with the horror field to be of appeal to horror fans at large, such as myself.  It's a comedy a lot of the time, but not in a stupid or 'spoofish' way; its humor is genuine and not merely parodying something else so it doesn't have to stand on its own feet.  And it's surprisingly moving and uplifting - in ways I'll go into more in a moment - but can one really class a movie centering on the battle between a man who may or may not be Elvis Presley against a life-draining immortal mummy who goes by the unlikely moniker of Bubba-Ho-Tep as a drama?<br /><br />  Here's where its inspirational and moving nature comes in: "Elvis" (he believes he's the real deal who switched places with an impersonator to get out of the limelight and then was trapped in the role when the impersonator died; the nursing home staff believe he hit his head too hard when he fell off a stage one night) is living a life of emptiness and despair.  Basically abandoned to his own devices in the home (this movie makes some points about the distressingly 'disposable' nature omuch of society seems to have assigned the elderly, the infirm and the mentally trobled), he's deteriorated physically and emotionally into a weak (and rather coarse-mouthed) shell of himself, hit particularly hard by the death of his roomate (whose demise is the first thing in years to bring any of the roomate's family to the home), is only jostled out of his state when the mummy begins making his appearances.  Clandestinely investigating the strange goings-on, a strange thing happens to "Elvis" himself: he begins to live again.  To paraphrase from a deleted scence where "Elvis" is noticing his improved vigor, he figures out that (and I'm paraphrasing here) "for the first time in a long time, I wasn't thinking about my next meal or whether I was going to be able to make it to the bathroom to take a ****, I was actually doing something that interested me."  In trying to stave off death, both for themselves and the other residents, 'Elvis' and JFK' begin to remember how to live again.  And the friendship formed between this unlikely (and cranky) pair is true and touching.  In the end it's two old men who society had sort of written off as just ticking off the days until death (and by this point, it perhaps doesn't matter so much if they really are who they think they are or not) that stage a showdown against an ancient evil that's only feeding on the weak while it powers up to truly terrorize the world.<br /><br />  For anyone who gets thinking that life has passed them by, that they're too old for something or that their dreams are dead beyond retrieval, this is powerful and inspirational stuff, and it doesn't matter whether you're 91 or 16 or 57.  A lot of people are going to think that's awfully sappy, but it's true and it's a powerful message.  It's also worth noting that this is one of very few movies to make characters this age its protagonists.<br /><br />  Ossie Davis, who I don't believe I've ever seen in anything else, is simply brilliant here.  And Bruce Campbell, famous for his turns as Ash in the "Evil Dead" trilogy (particularly shining in "Evil Dead 2", my personal favorite of the series) astonishes with how dead-on he captures the role, with a perfect accent for the part, and wordless facial expression conveying mountains of emotion, often of long-suppressed emotion just now cracking the surface.  For fans of weird cinema, deep drama, horror and/or off-the-beaten-track comedy; "Bubba-Ho-Tep" is one of the unlikliest greats I've seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>How can you not love a movie called Bubba Ho-Tep featuring the King of Rock 'n' Roll taking on a cowboy mummy - especially when you have Bruce Campbell playing the role of Elvis?  Add in a remarkable performance by Ossie Davis, one of the best soundtracks in recent years, and a huge number of extras on the DVD, and you've got a movie of must-see status.  This film was actually a lot different from what I was expecting; I went in looking for comedy, and I got comedy - but I also got a really quite serious film that speaks to the audience on all sorts of meaningful levels.  Bubba Ho-Tep gets better on multiple viewings, as well, and I suspect some folks who weren't that enthused with the film might change their minds if they were to watch it again.<p>It's sort of hard to classify this thing.  Sure, there's a 4000-year-old, soul-sucking mummy and some nasty scarab beetles killing people, but this is not just a horror movie.  It's a poignant look at the way old people are pushed aside and forgotten by the younger generations, a poignant look at one man's reflections back on his life, and it's also wickedly funny.  Here's the story; bear with me on this.  Elvis Presley is stuck in a nursing home in Mud Creek, Texas; back in the 1970s, he switched places with Sebastian Haff, one of the best Elvis impersonators, and now his new life is entering its final, loneliest phase.  He is now a little old and feeble, he has a bad hip that forces him to use a walker, but he's mainly just feeling old and used up and worthless.  When his roommate dies, he watches the guy's daughter (Heidi Marnhout - who is quite a looker, by the way) come and basically toss the old man's life and memories right in the trash.  Then some old folks around him start dying mysterious deaths - deaths caused by a soul-sucking mummy in snakeskin boots and a cowboy hat.  Hey, even Elvis has a hard time believing it until he sees it for himself.  His only ally is President John F. Kennedy, played by Ossie Davis.  Okay, I know you're saying &quot;Isn't Ossie Davis black?&quot;  What happened, see, is that, after the shooting in Dallas, &quot;they&quot; dyed JFK black and filled his head with sand (his brain is still in Washington, running on battery power) - that's what Jack thinks, anyway.  Well, these two old guys load up for bear and go out to kill themselves a mummy.  <p>The plot may sound stupid, but this is in no way a stupid movie.  Unfortunately, the things that make Bubba Ho-Tep such a great film are impossible to describe and quantify in words.  It's an Elvis redemption story, as he gets up out of the bed and sets aside his age and, uh, problems, to become the hero he always wanted to be - he finds a reason to live again.  Ossie Davis really makes the movie work; it takes a really great actor to play a black John F. Kennedy, and this movie may have failed utterly without his contribution to the project.  Bruce Campbell is, of course, superb.  One critic called his performance one for the ages; I'm not sure I would go that far, but he does an amazing job, one which only furthers his cult status among his growing number of fans.<p>My hat is definitely off to Don Coscarelli for his vision and determination to make this film.  The studios wouldn't touch this thing with a ten-foot pole (which says a lot about what is wrong with the studios), the actors' agents weren't exactly keen on their guys taking the roles being offered, and there wasn't much money at all in terms of budget, but Coscarelli really makes the magic happen.  The makeup job on Campbell was pretty good for the most part, and the man pretty much becomes the King.  The soundtrack, as I've mentioned, is just incredible, thanks to composer Brian Tyler - even if you hate the movie, you may have to go out and buy the soundtrack.  Bubba Ho-Tep did enjoy a limited distribution in theatres, earning film festival kudos in the process, but this independent film release is really one of those things that starts with word-of-mouth advertising and then just spreads like wildfire.  <p>The DVD is incredible.  Along with several featurettes on the making of the movie, theatrical and TV trailers, a music video of the theme song, deleted scenes, and a reading by Joe R. Lansdale from his original Bubba Ho-Tep short story on which the film was based, you also get two commentaries.  The first one, featuring director Don Coscarelli and Bruce Campbell, is as informative as it is fun, but the second commentary is something special as it features &quot;The King&quot; himself - this is one of the funniest things I've ever heard in my life and definitely my favorite commentary of all time.  This movie is worth buying for this alone, as The King's reactions to different aspects of the story and his frequent observations about the differences between this and his own films will have you rolling on the floor.<p>I wish I could communicate just how poignant this film really is.  Despite of all the humor and farcical action going on, this movie addresses a lot of serious themes in a remarkable way.  You'll laugh, you might even cry, and you will almost definitely go around doing Elvis impersonations of your own for at least a week.  This is entertainment of the highest order, my friends.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NOZB6VZCTOI4.html">A2NOZB6VZCTOI4</a><br/><p>I bought this movie, because the premise seemed so totally outlandish to me I just had to know what secrets it held. This is one of my favorite movies in a long time. It is definitely my favorite horror movie to date. I won't give away too much of the plot, as it is so delicious you need to watch it unfold in front of you with no preconceptions. Suffice it to say that Elvis is still alive and living in a nursing home in Texas with JFK. Due to a quirky turn of fate the two of them team up and battle an Egyptian mummy in an amazing battle of wits that is metaphorically a battle of good versus evil. There are many unusual twists and turns in the plot, but I was greatly heartened by the ending.<p>Bruce Campbell is Elvis in the movie. When I say he is Elvis, I mean he IS Elvis. He is wonderful as the elderly crabby Elvis and makes the film the success it is. The other lead role, that of President Kennedy (who is alive, but has a sandbag placed in part of his head) is played by the gifted Ossie Davis, a wonderful actor, who, if you don't know, is black (They dyed me this color!) These two become friends at the depressing nursing home, where they are patronized by the staff incessantly. <p>Perhaps I should have titled the review &quot;Elvis and JFK Battle a Mummy Texas Style,&quot; but this really is mostly a story of redemption. Eventually Elvis and JFK realize that they are the only ones able to conquer the mummy and it gives them a reason to live, and in the end, redemption. This brings up my very favorite point about this film. It is wonderful seeing two elderly heroes in this movie. In a society where so many of our elderly are invisible and the entire culture is youth-obsessed it was a brilliant masterstroke to show the value of our elders by making them the heroes. In real life Bruce Campbell is not elderly (he had lots of makeup), but Ossie Davis really is 83, and still looks great. <p>There are many moments of humor in the film, my favorite of which is when Elvis and JFK discover hieroglyphics written on a bathroom stall wall that JFK translates as &quot;Pharaoh gobbles donkey goobers; Cleopatra does the nasty.&quot; There are also bizarre fight scenes, such as when Elvis takes on the giant flying scarab beetle with some karate moves and a bedpan. There are other cool effects such as when the mummy 'speaks' in amusing hieroglyphics and the stars move to spell out a message to Elvis in the end. The mummy himself is very well done, and very creepy. This movie has something for everyone, and I recommend it highly. If I could change one thing it would be a bit of the sporadically bad language, although it is basically used to reinforce the crankiness of the two title characters.<p>The extras on the DVD are compendious, and well worth watching. There are commentary tracks (including one by Elvis!), and 'making of' type documentaries, which you need to watch. It is fabulous that they made such an original and worthwhile movie on such a low budget. I will watch for more from Don Coscarelli and the other makers of this mind-altering film.<p>Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/A3AKPY4LXIC24O.html">A3AKPY4LXIC24O</a><br/><p>&quot;What the Hell?&quot;  That's pretty much the standard response when confronted with the premise for this film.  Elvis, who switched places with an impersonator, didn't die like we've all been led to believe.  He's been living out the last of his days at the Mud Creek Shady Rest Convalesence Home, worrying about a growth on a very private part of his anatomy and stewing in regret.  One of his fellow boarders is a black man convinced that he's JFK.  That weird enough for you?  Ok, well then, how 'bout adding a soul sucking mummy taking advantage of the weak prey provided by the rest home?  Still not weird enough?  Well then, picture a geriatric Elvis, using a walker, fighting aforementioned mummy.  Pretty darn weird.  It is, I'll admit it, and the fact that this film was made in any capacity is a testament not only to the draw of Bruce Campbell but also the genius of Don Coscarelli (of Phantasm fame).  The audience for this type of movie is, to put it nicely, select.  I think the idea was to pick the oddest Joe Lansdale story (which can be found in his brilliant collection Writer of the Purple Rage) and see if any financial backer would bite. Getting any money for this project must have been a chore in itself.  One of the reasons I liked this movie so much was that it just seemed so Corman-esque in nature, like it was made just for the hell of it.  To make a movie, not for critics, not for blockbuster profit, but for fans of the off-the wall.  If you like comedy, horror, drama, and poorly lit spanish soap operas this film should appeal to you in some way.  <p>The biggest surprise was Bruce Campbell's performance, not that it was good (that's a frickin' given) but that it was so restrained.  The most manic you will see ol' BC is during a fight with an extremely fake scarab beetle in his bedroom and even that isn't all that manic.  It makes me wonder why a guy of this level of talent isn't making more movies, but then I remember Hollywood is evil and move on.  <p>The movie isn't so much a horror tale (the scariest part is the idea of being left to die in a rest home) but a story of doing what's right, not matter how bizarre.  So don't look for the Evil Dead, take it for what it is ( a low budget horror movie with a character focus), laugh at the hilarious premise and enjoy.  Hopefully this will lead to more adaptations of Lansdale's work, especially The Drive-In and The Bottoms.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>Here's the kind of film that we don't see much anymore.  Sure, Troma's been doing movies with silly, outrageous plots for some time now, but we all know what those films are like.  Bubba Ho-Tep is a film that is B movie all the way, and aims to make you laugh, and succeeds in a more classy way than a Troma film.  I was inpressed by Don Coscarelli letting his wacky side loose.  Honestly, I had begun to think that he couldn't really do anything outside the Phantasm series, which I also love.  It's so hard to try and explain this movie because it's not the typical B horror comedy, or the Army Of Darkness humor that Bruce Campbell worshippers have come to expect.  Sure, he's funny as hell in his role, but not in his trademark slapstick way.  He can also act.......and good!  The role is bizarre and far fetched, but he's very convincing and obviously Bruce really believed in this project coz it shows in his performance.  It's amazing how his performance is a spoof, yet it's also a serious tribute to Elvis Presley.  Not too many guys could pull this job off, folks.  Most actors could only play it totally bio-pic serious or straight forward comedy.  Ossie Davis?  I've always liked Ossie Davis, and he's just as likeable and funny here as Bruce.  I can't say he hit JFK right on the head, he could have just as easily been a different character.  That's small potatoes though, coz he's perfect as Bruce's partner either way you cut it.  This movie could have worked just on the "what if" premise of it's two stars, but no!  It gets more outrageous as it goes along by pitting these celebrities up against a soul sucking mummy type guy that sucks souls through people's butts and writes dirty messages on bathroom stall walls in hieroglyphics.  Really, could you ask for a better movie late at night in the theater over some buttered popcorn and a box of Dots?  Cheesy B movies in a theater at night is what living's all about.  Too bad it doesn't happen that much anymore.  We're stuck with having to see crud like Gothika which takes itself way too seriously, and in many ways is alot more silly than this film!  It may be hard to track down considering your local corporate theater chains won't have the time of day for this film and would rather play crud like the Texas Chainsaw remake for another week instead of this film.  But, if you can find it, see it!  You'll like it!  Thank you, Mr. Coscarelli.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>With a movie named "Bubba Ho-Tep," you know it has to be interesting. Throw in Bruce Campbell as the lead, and the Whackymeter goes off the charts.<br /><br />Bubba Ho-Tep is the tale of loves lost and destinies denied. The movie opens with Elvis (Campbell) in a rest home in East Texas, having long since switched his identity with an Elvis impersonator named Sebastian (also Campbell). A broken hip lands the Real Elvis in a retirement home. And of course, he has no proof that he is truly the real Elvis because all the papers blew up in a "barbeque accident."<br /><br />Elvis' one companion is JFK. Yes, that John F. Kennedy. Except that he's a black man played by Ossie Davis. And the government altered his body (from white to black) to conceal his identity. And there's sand filling the hole in his head from the assassination attempt.<br /><br />Think that's weird? We haven't even gotten to the plot yet.<br /><br />Stalking the retirement home is a soul-sucking mummy. The mummy was kidnapped from a local exhibit but then crashed into a nearby river. It now stalks the living, absorbing their "ka" (or was it "ba"?) through any orifice available. And when you think about it, wouldn't a retirement home be the perfect feasting ground for a creature that feeds on people? After all, nobody notices - or, director Don Coscarelli (of Phantasm fame) hints, actually cares - when the elderly die. If they happen to die a little earlier, so what?<br /><br />The real terror is that the victims' souls are digested and ultimately destroyed. No afterlife for them. Nothing.<br /><br />This mummy, for reasons that aren't quite fully explained, dresses in cowboy boots and a broad-brimmed hat when he stalks his prey. He is, in essence, a "bubba." Thus, Bubba Ho-Tep.<br /><br />There's a lot of symbolism and parallels in this movie that make it alternately thoughtful and sad. Elvis, a symbol of male virility, now has a "cancerous growth" in a very personal place that he believes will eventually kill him. JFK, a symbol of government stability, is cast as a paranoid delusional old black man. And the mummy, an ancient being that no one remembers but is valuable enough to steal from a museum, is just trying to survive.<br /><br />This movie is a lot less Evil Dead and a lot more Cocoon. We see what happens to the elderly in disturbingly accurate detail: Elvis' roommate, Bull Thomas (Harrisong Young) dies a long, slow death. His delicious but estranged daughter Callie (Heidi Marnhout) collects Bull's things, only to toss them away...including Bull's Purple Heart medal. Callie, with her short skirt and high heels, comes to represent the youth obsessed culture that has neither the time nor inclination to care for the old and infirm.<br /><br />Coscarelli shows us Elvis' slow death through his own eyes. Time speeds up as nurses zip in and out of his room. It is all so meaningless and drab, such that it's only a matter of time before Elvis dies, alone and estranged from his own daughter. Just like Bull. It's a credit to the film that Bull is never forgotten.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are a lot of homages to Elvis and Evil Dead. As my wife pointed out, there are some obvious parallels to what Ash experiences in Evil Dead, including a scene where Elvis chants a spell to stop the mummy. There are plenty of references to Elvis' knowledge of martial arts, his experiences in television, and the bad choices he made in his past. Elvis fans will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Okay, maybe they will be a little disappointed that their beloved icon is hobbling around in a retirement home with a possible STD fighting a mummy.<br /><br />Bruce Campbell does a great job as Elvis beneath makeup and fat suits. Ossie Davis plays JFK straight, an amazing feat unto itself in a movie whose plot revolves around a mummy run amok. Everyone else is suitably one-dimensional.<br /><br />Alone and with only one friend, Elvis finally decides to make a stand. He watches another icon, the Lone Ranger (a guy they call Kemosabe, played by Larry Pennell) fight the mummy off and die as a result. He died, but his soul was intact.<br /><br />In some sense, the mummy is the second chance for two mythological characters to take their place in history. Although the Lone Ranger was fiction, JFK and Elvis were not. However, they have become so revered and characterized that they are legends unto themselves - easily on par with the Lone Ranger. The problem is, neither JFK or Elvis were ever really that heroic. They were real people, with real flaws. With the arrival of the mummy, they have the chance to earn their heroic status and die how we would want all heroes to die - fighting evil, not rotting away in a retirement home.<br /><br />Bubba Ho-Tep also has some genuinely scary moments. The mummy first manifests as a big, nasty scarab, killing a vicious old lady who steals the glasses right off of a woman in an iron lung. Then Elvis takes on the scarab mano-a-mano, and we are once again reminded of Campbell as Ash.<br /><br />Bubba Ho-Tep is a slow, plodding movie. The music, the casting, and the direction is all spot on, but it is not really an action movie, a comedy, or a drama. Ultimately, Bubba Ho-Tep is a horror movie, but not in the traditional sense.<br /><br />Bubba Ho-Tep is about growing old, being forgotten, and not mattering enough for people to care about you anymore. And that's horror enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GD9BKIUT3I89.html">A3GD9BKIUT3I89</a><br/><p>This is a one of a kind - a true cult film.  The director of PHANTASM and Bruce Campbell as Elvis Presley.  What more does one have to say?  It is a riot.  An Egyptian Mummy who comes to a rest home and begins killing it's residents -- and only Elvis and JFK (Ossie Davis) can stop it!  Elvis in a walker -- he threw out his hip with a karate kick.  It's common for people to tell you everything about the film to the point where you ask yourself, "Why see it?  I know everything."  So I won't.  Based on a story by Texas author Joe R.

Interesting extras, including a bewildered Elvis commenting on the film!  As the Beatles once said, "A good time is guaranteed for all."</p></br></body></html>

Co-written and directed by Peter Berg, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is an adaptation of Buzz Bissinger's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P2XNL6">Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream</a> . Another football movie telling, this time, the story of a Texas high school team heading to the state championship. Good movie presenting this sport as an American rite of passage for boys.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>Actor Peter Berg gets behind the camera and takes us on a journey to the west Texas town of Odessa.  His movie is more than about football.  It's about a way of life for a small town and the pressure the towns people put on these young boys to strive and win the biggest prize, a state championship.  Berg's direction is outstanding.  I really liked the fact that he wasn't concentrating on glitz and glamour.  It wasn't a typical Hollywood production.  There are no heroes, just people who are flawed.  Country singer Tim McGraw shows his star power as the troubled dad aof a football player.  Billy Bob once again shows his greatness as the football coach under pressure to win "State".  It's an outstanding film that was based on a true story shows us there's more important things than football such as enjoying life.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Five years after "Varsity Blues," another film about West Texas high school football comes with Billy Bob Thornton as Coach Gary Gaines who must lead his team to the championship, no matter what it takes.  Based on the real games and the real people, who participated in the 1988 season, 'Friday Night Lights' is more authentic and often alarmingly realistic than 'Varsity Blues' (which I like), in describing the glory of being the star players, and revealing the reality surrounding them.<br /><br />Director Peter Berg (The Rock's successful 'The Rundown'), perhaps inevitably, spends most of the films on the life on and out of the field of the high school players -- THE star of the team 'Booobie' (Derek Luke), team leader Mike (Lucas Black), and Charles (Tim McGraw) whose abusive father keeps on telling how he is disappointed with his son.  So far, things are not new.  If you think one of them is too confident, you already know what will happen to him.<br /><br />To see the life of Coach Gaines, with good acting from Billy Bob Thornton, is more intersting to me, for his life in the city of Odessa, Texas, could be very intense, nearly life-or-death matter.  The townspeople come to the Coach, and then, quietly tell him that their team must win -- if not directly, with uninvited suggestions.  And as far as the football goes, when they wish something, that something must be realized.  Like winning the State.<br /><br />[CONVENTIONAL BUT SOLID] Despite the semi-documentray touch of the slightly shaky and grainy photography, the film is made with an orthodox approach.  At first the film has some moments showing the players' doubts about their way of life, or even the way of the football itself (and the community that suppport with enthusiasm), but gradually the heroism takes them over, with the exciting scenes of the bone-crunching games and dedicated football players.  The story is very conventional, but the presentation is solid and well-paced.<br /><br />Like his previous 'The Rundown,' Peter Berg conducts everything with confidence, and the results are very satisfactory even though you don't particularly like the world of American high school football.  Even if you don't come to like the sports itself, you come to understand the people in this small town where the Friday Night Lights mean everything to them, the glory, the life and all.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Friday Night Lights depicts the 1988 Season of the Permian Panthers from Odessa Texas.  The film makes clear that Odessa is one of those West Texas towns where high school football is more than the community religion.  Nothing in Odessa matters other than winning the state football championship.  I wonder how the next Einstein or Condoleeza Rice or Colin Powell would react to being raised in such a community. All individual and community self-esteem is tied up in this single-minded goal.  Former Permian players parade around town proudly displaying THEIR state championship rings, and there seems to be no other source of community pride.  There is no sense of the Olympic ideal "the essential thing is not to have conquered, but to have fought well".  The well-fought fight is not appreciated in Odessa and the film is filled with scenes where Head Coach Gaines (in a wonderful performance by Billy Bob Thornton) is reminded over and over by community leaders that anything less than a state championship is unacceptable.<br /><br />I always wonder about individuals and groups who tie so much of their own happiness to the outcome of sporting events.  Thornton gives us brief glimpses at the idea that Coach Gaines recognizes that even the State Championship Game is, after all, only a game.<br /><br />A group of barely-known actors make up the team.  We recognize the more grownup Lucas Black (the kid from "Sling Blade") once again paired with Billy Bob, this time as the quarterback filled with self-doubts, even as he leads the Panthers to the State play-offs.  Derek Luke brings his chiseled body to the part of Boobie Miles, the star running back who is on the fast track to the NFL - until he tears his knee up with a mixture of bad luck and bravado.  Grover Coulson is terrific as Boobie's Uncle L.V., who took over raising the young man after Boobie's parents were out of the picture.  L.V. clearly wants what's best for Boobie, but you can also see that he knows Boobie is so close to the NFL and it's riches that he can taste it. The most heartbreaking scene in the film comes after Boobie is evaluated by an out of town Orthopedist who tells Boobie that his ACL is torn and he won't be able to cut any more, then Boobie and L.V. get together to mislead Coach Gaines into thinking that Boobie will be able to play.<br /><br />Garrett Hedlund stars as the other running back with a tendency to drop the ball and with an abusive alcoholic father who flashes his own State Championship Ring between drunken fits of child abuse.  Tim McGraw continues the Billy Bob connection by having another well-known country singer playing a scumbag.  (Following Sling Blades' Dwight Yoakum.) The DVD includes a documentary about the "real" Panthers and suggests that the "real" Charles Billingsley was only intense rather than an abusive drunk.<br /><br />The film is shot like a documentary, and it was about 15 minutes into the movie before it started feeling like a movie at all.  This adds to the "realism", but also creates a little shakiness to the viewing experience as hand-held camera shots wiggle the main characters through the frame.<br /><br />I knew nothing about the "real" story before seeing the film, but it is clear that you are moving toward a State Championship Game - and early on you see that the opponents are going to be a team from Dallas made up of players that look like they outweight the Panthers by about 50 pounds per player.  The Panther's trip to the big game hits a few speed bumps while the team from Dallas looks like an unbeatable behemoth.<br /><br />By the end of the film I had the reassuring sense that as a result of this season the community of Odessa had a better appreciation for the "well fought fight".  You'll see what I mean.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Peter Berg.<br /><br />Cast:  Billy Bob Thornton, Lucas Black, Garrett Hedlund, Derek Luke, Jay Hernandez, Lee Jackson, Lee Thompson Young Tim McGraw, Connie Britton.<br /><br />Running Time:  118 minutes.<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for language and some sexual references and content.<br /><br />Although nothing that we have not seen before, "Friday Night Lights" makes up for unoriginality and mediocre, erratic cinematography with superb, sincere performances from a great ensemble cast of unknown youngsters, a beautifully crafted musical score from Brian Reitzell, and tremendously compelling football action.  The film ambits the trials and tribulations of the 1988 Odessa-Permian high school football squad in search of a state championship, but with an in-depth look into the true reality and significance of football on the lives of all that it touches in a small Texas community, "Friday Night Lights" proves to be more than just a run-of-the-mill sports drama.<br /><br />Billy Bob Thornton appends a unique role to his impressive resume, playing head Permian coach Gary Gaines, a well-respected leader of his troops but always under intense pressure from the Odessa faithful to be the best.  While Thornton may be the well-known star of the film, the film spotlights the metamorphosis of the team's courageous season through the eyes of the players:  quiet team captain Mike Winchell (performed exceptionally well by Lucas Black) not only has to lead his team to victory, but has the sole responsibility of taking care of his unhealthy mother; back-up halfback Don Billingsly (Garrett Hedlund) must live in shadow of his former Permian star father (Tim McGraw) and survive the continuous harsh criticism from the man who wants him to succeed the most; and the eccentric Boobie Miles (Derek Luke, star of "Antoine Fisher"), an incredibly tantalizing force on the football field, who must fight through injuries and life in the limelight.<br /><br />"Friday Night Lights" is based on the bestselling novel written by H.G. Bissinger (who happens to be director Peter Berg's cousin) and is adapted brilliantly by David Aaron Cohen and Berg.  "Friday Night Lights" is not the easiest film to stomach (not due to violence, but because of some abnormal jerkiness of the camera), but the film is driven by the splendid supporting performances of McGraw and Luke.  Thornton is very convincing as the demanding, hard-nosed coach who believes in perfection, but ultimately shows his depth as an actor as he exponentially augments Coach Gaines sincerity and heart as the film progresses.  Not quite "The Field of Dreams" of the football drama genre, but a great sport drama nonetheless that will certainly touch those who understand the meaning of high school sports to teenagers who play them.  One of the best "half-time" speeches in film history.  A touching, heartfelt drama.</p></br><a href="../users/AS28WVBBZ3G99.html">AS28WVBBZ3G99</a><br/><p>This is not your usual David and Goliath sports film about the gritty underdogs who prove that hard work and faith will overcome all odds. Nope.<br /><br />While these kids are taught about hard work and discipline there is so much more. They learn about humility ("Don't believe your press clippings"), fading glory of high school football, ("This is the best moment of your life") and the withering, destructive nature of personal ambition and pride (It's all about Boobie").<br /><br />As a parent of high school athletes, I found too much that was distrubingly familiar. It gave me pause to remember how I had handled similar situations with my kids - and I didn't like every personal reflection I had.<br /><br />A lot of herd-hitting truth is packed into this excellent film. And a lot of hard-hitting action, too! This is a moving, powerful, and persuasive rendering of a fascinating story of high school sports in America.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4.html">A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4</a><br/><p>This film ended up be much better than I thought. The story centers around a Texas high school football team and their hopes for a state championship win. Trouble ensues when star player Boobie (how'd he get that name?) injures his leg. Pretty good performances and scary to think that people can get so carried away with a game that it rules their lives. Then again, this is Texas so what else do they have to do with themselves?</p></br><a href="../users/A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1.html">A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1</a><br/><p>No sympathy for Football, but I've got to say Friday Night Lights is an amazing movie.<br /><br />Director Peter Berg, along with his co-screenwriter David Aaron Cohen have done a fantastice job geting the material from the actual events and putting them on screen. The actors put in that great sense of feeling that the pressure is on by the town and their familys. This isn't much of high school foot ball to the teamt, it's a high stakes job that's worlds more important than even their education. As for the town of Odessa, these boys are there movie stars and are hyped as such. The players sign autographs, take pictures with babies, and girls then turn into groupies. All this comes with the fame, but when a game is lost they all feel the brunt of it from the town as well. Even if your not into football indeed you will enjoy this movie. It gets your really hyperactive to play football. Go see this movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A4UKBG3M5U5TI.html">A4UKBG3M5U5TI</a><br/><p>"Friday Night Lights" tells of the 1988 Odessa, Texas high school football team.  In Texas, football is king, and the hopes and dreams of entire towns can ride on their team.  Odessa won state championships before, but this team is perhaps a bit smaller than usual, and the coach is new and untested.  Fortunately, they have Boobie Miles, a star player who could possibly carry them to the state championship.  The movie follows these players over the season, as the town alternates between rallying around them and vilifying them.<br /><br />Based on the non-fiction book by Buzz Bissinger, "Friday Night Lights" doesn't rely on the "big game" ending typical of sports movies.  The movie focuses on football, but it relies more on the characters.  It's about a town that is economically depressed and needs something behind which to rally.  "Friday Night Lights" could be just another Cinderella sports story.  However, it's not about winning - it's about the pressure the town puts on the team and the coach.  Fortunately, the acting is superb, especially Lucas Black ("Sling Blade") as the glowering quarterback and Derek Luke ("Antwone Fisher") as the star, Boobie.  You feel for these boys; you want them to win; but most of all, you want them to have some kind of life after the season draws to a close.  That's what "Friday Night Lights" is all about, and it's a really terrific movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Friday Night Lights gives a good picture of small-town Texas where high school football is the most exciting thing around.  The whole town feels ownership in the team, and people don't hesitate to tell the coaches what to do, and the players, how to do it.  The end result, especially in a town like Odessa, where past successes fuel future aspirations, is a coach and players who are in a constant pressure-cooker.  The movie illustrates the different reactions which individuals have to these pressures.  Billy Bob Thorton, as the coach, is unfailingly polite to the townspeople, even when they track him down outside of Wal-Mart to give him advice.  He cares more about the boys' character than how many games they win, an attitude which is not always popular in Odessa.  His star player is a cocky young man who puts all of his hopes on obtaining a college scholarship and eventually playing in the pros.  When an injury ends this dream, he is shattered.  The quarterback is sincere and hard-working and loves football, but he hates the pressure of winning.  Another of the young players is constantly harrassed by his father who won a state championship and will stand for nothing less from his son.  This is an exciting sports movie which clearly demonstrates the problems with the "win at all costs" mentality.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>Based on H.G. ("Buzz") Bissinger's book with the same title and directed by Peter Berg, this film focuses on the Permian (Texas) High School Panthers' 1988 season which ended in the state championship game played in the Houston Astrodome against Dallas Carter High School. Frankly, although I have lived in Texas for almost 30 years and am well aware of the passion which football at all levels generates throughout the state, I still find it difficult to believe the nature and extent of pressure which otherwise sensible adults place on the importance of winning games. Permian coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) is a case in point. If we are to believe Bissinger's account, Gaines was in real danger of losing his job if the Panthers lost the state championship game. (Interestingly, he and his team won it the next year.) The quality of acting throughout the cast is solid but several characters (e.g. Charles Billingsley played by Tim McGraw) seem stereotypical. For whatever reasons, Berg fails to develop any of the leading characters (notably Coach Gaines) beyond what would be revealed in a brief encounter at the local Dairy Queen. In fact, for me at least, the only sympathetic character (if there is one) is the team's star running back, Boobie Miles (Derek Luke), and that's a bit of a stretch, given his peacock personality. The on-field action seems authentic, especially in the championship game. Among sports films, I rate Friday Night Lights comparable with Rudy (1993) and Remember the Titans (2000) but a notch or two below Hoosiers (1986), Varsity Blues (1999), and Miracle (2004). In terms of sustained suspense and dramatic impact, I rate it lower than, for example, The Last Picture Show (1991) with which it shares a few issues in common and Field of Dreams (1989) which, in contrast, celebrates innocence rather than denigrates it as Friday Night Lights does, albeit by implication.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7.html">A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7</a><br/><p>Based on the book of the same name, Friday Night Lights is an honorable addition to sports movies.  To say that the fans of Permian high school in Odessa, in west Texas, live for their team could be the understatement of the year.  It makes for a ton of pressure on 17 year old boys, but then, none of these "boys" look anywhere near 17, a standard Hollywood problem with teenage character movies.<br /><br />The movie runs around two hours; you don't notice the time, a very good indicator.  It has excellent cinematography, including some superb setting shots that wonderfully capture the vast emptiness of West Texas.  Billy Bob Thornton as the coach is as good as I've seen him and singer Tim McGraw as the bullying father of one player launches a second career.  The football action, particularly the close-up tackling, approaches NFL highlights for realism.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are problems besides the overaged "boys."  Some of the story lines get pretty short shrift.  For example, I never did figure out just exactly what the weirdness was with the quarterback's mother, failing health? kind of wacko?, who knows? And Permian's opponents in the state championship are painted in such ridiculous villain colors that it virtually invites the audience to hiss.<br /><br />While not nearly as good as its thematic cousins Hoosiers and Remember the Titans, Friday Night Lights is still definitely worth one of your own Friday nights.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>As Coach Billy Bob Thornton tells his players, being perfect is not about winning, it's about playing for the other players, and doing the best you can.  With that in mind, director Peter Berg's FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is a perfect sports movie.  If you're not a football fanatic (which I am not), it becomes mystical as to how a sport can be such a religious experience for small towns.  Stores close down for games; everyone tries to tell the coach how to coach; what should be a carefree bunch of 17 year old boys becomes a collection of sour-faced, fatalistic young men who fear that if they don't win the state championship, their lives have no meaning.  One of the most disturbing lines in the film comes from the voice of a radio sportscaster who is chiding the coach for playing an injured player, and he adds, "There's too much learning in schools."  How sad that students are judged not on their academic merits, but how well they catch or throw a pigskin.  While I certainly recognize the need for athletics in school, the fanaticism exhibited in movies like this can only reinforce how overemphasized it can be.  And how violent and mean.  Players intentionally try to hurt other players, and the adults become like children in their overzealous attempts to relive their lives through these spirited boys.<br /><br />As a movie, though, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS works because of the extremely talented cast Berg was fortunate enough to come up with.  Thornton is brilliant as the coach, who feels his whole coaching career rides on winning this big game; all of the boys are superb, but special notice should be given to Lucas Black, Garrett Hedlund and Jay Hernandez.  Their heart and soul provides the true foundation of the movie's team.  Derek Luke as Boobie strikes a one note performance until his wonderful scene where he breaks down and says he doesn't know how to do anything but play football.  (Another sign of the academic system's failure to promote education as well as sports).  And of course, the surprisingly effective performance of country singer Tim McGraw as the brutal father whose own upbringing echoes in the sad treatment of his son who just can't seem to hold on to the ball.  It's a brave performance for this superstar:  he struts around shirtless, without the kind of physique one would expect; he doesn't mind playing a sleazeball to contradict his heroic status in the country music market.  He's very good and should try some more roles in the future.<br /><br />The movie has a lot of heart and it's ending only reinforces how unfair life can be sometimes.  If you are a football fanatic, this movie should be right up your alley, but if you're not one, you should still appreciate the immense amount of effort our young boys put into the sport, and how being perfect can make it better.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>The overall message of FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, that the most important drive in a person's life is to be 'perfect' - meaning true to one's self, always doing the best you can, being able to look your loved ones in the eye knowing you have done your best - is worth saying repeatedly.  When it comes from the mouth of Billy Bob Thornton playing the coach of a West Texas high school football team, it is eloquent.<br /><br />There is an honesty to this recreation of a true story as adapted by Peter Berg that rings true. Though the film is apparently about a football team's obsession with winning the Texas State Championship, it is more concerned with showing us the extremes such obsession drives small towns, parents, townsfolk, and even teammates into a variation of road rage.  Each of the teammates is examined and found to be the victim of too high expectations and distorted values.  It is the heart of the coach that ultimately puts winning and losing into perspective, and that moment in the locker room of the final game is superb.<br /><br />The cast is good, especially Billy Bob Thornton as the coach, but also his players Derek Luke, Lucas Black, Garrett Hedlund, Jay Hernandez, Lee Jackson,  and Lee Thompson Young.  The direction is fine except for the ever-present level of noise from the sport and from the intrusive music, jerky editing, and jumbled views of the games in action.  Not a great movie, but a fine message delivered by some very fine actors.  Grady Harp, February 2005</p></br><a href="../users/A1LP6O85Z894GT.html">A1LP6O85Z894GT</a><br/><p>First things first. Please read Bissinger's superb piece of personal journalism that inspired this film. It will help fill in the historical, political, racial and societal gaps that the film medium is not always able to communicate in a two hour running time.<br /><br />That said, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is an honest and emotional journey throught the obsessiveness that permeates every pore of a small Texas town. The point of religious zealotry is of course, in this instance, High School football.<br /><br />Director Peter Berg (Bissinger's cousin in fact) wisely chooses to shoot the film in a documentary fashion in an effort to capture the original book's journalistic viewpoint. For viewers used to the straight ahead approach conventionally employed by the sports film genre, this might be somewhat off putting. Berg often employ's hand held shots that swish and pan through the scene, providing long takes that capture the immediacy of the characters' lives and environments. This film making choice allows the actors to inhabit their roles truthfully without feeling the need to grandize.<br /><br />On the note of acting, all the performers give naturalistic, low-key performances. There is nary a false note. Anchored by Billy Bob Thorton's understated work as head coach Gary Gaines, the ensemble cast avoids "star" performances and creates a meaningful ensemble. Again, Berg's cinema-verite' camera draws the viewer into the characters' lives and invites the actors to embrace the genuine truth of each organic moment. Like any good documentary, there are many scenes where the viewer feels uncomfortable and like an intruder on someone else's private moment. The heart rendering scenes between Tim McGraw (making a stunning debut here) and his son, being just one instance.<br /><br />The echoing, and haunting score by Explosions in the Sky evokes the painful loneliness that awaits each high school athlete after the cheering ends and the stadium empties and all that awaits is the vast, vacuous Texas prarie night.<br /><br />Berg avoids many of the tried and true cliche's that dominate so many sports films. There is no uplifting training sequence. There is no obligatory scene of team bonding (usuall the team lip syncing to a Motown classic in the shower). The big game is an ultimate let down (not a spoiler for anyone who has read the book).<br /><br />The action scenes of the football games themselves are brutal. Berg never lets the audience forget that these games are violent rituals, creating a communal substitution for nothing less than war.<br /><br />The film is not without its flaws. It's attention to period detail is negligible (come on, where are all the "mullets"?)and it doesn't approach the scope of the book's superb social commentary (there are historic, economic and political reasons High School Football has such prominence). I also missed the portrayl of the special treatment the athletes received in school. This was (and still IS in many instances) an era where the definition of "student/athlete" was nebulous.<br /><br />The DVD's deleted scenes do provide some of the social commentary though and a behind the scenes documentary places real faces and voices to the characters' on screen life. To see what followed the events depicted in the film reminds the viewer that life does not end once the pads are put away.<br /><br />Like Bissinger's book, Berg's film resounds with a underlying sadness. These young boys may be warriors once, but they are always replacable and interchangeable. They are plaques and tiles always ready to be tossed into the trash in favor of next year's batch. These young men often face careers of "what could have been" and "used to be's". But for a brief and shining moment, they held court and came to life under the brilliant hope of FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>There can be no doubt that Friday Night Lights is a remarkably good motion picture, but I have to admit that I have mixed emotions about the film.  Maybe that is a good thing because one thing this movie makes almost all of us do is think about ourselves.  The majority of us are in there somewhere - maybe you're the dad who puts too much pressure on your kid to be a star athlete, or the coach's wife whose very way of life becomes defined by a simple game made much too complicated by the community, or the rabid fan who lives and dies with your team and never hesitates to berate a coach or player who makes one mistake.  Maybe you're the star athlete who saw your dreams die in the form of a serious injury, or the little guy who had to prove your toughness, etc.  If you care enough about sports to watch this movie, you're in here somewhere.<br /><br />Back to my mixed feelings, though.  I love football; it's a great sport that lets you have some fun and learn important lessons, such as teamwork, you can put to good use throughout your life - but there is an ugly side to the sport, and Friday Night Lights shows you just about everything that is wrong with this great game.  There is nothing fun about being a Panther during the season chronicled in this film.  On day one of practice, every kid on every high school team should want a state championship, but none should expect it.  Desire brings out the best in you, while expectation sets you up for a fall.  In Odessa, Texas, though, the very spirit of the game is betrayed by the adults in the community; not only do they expect a championship, they demand it; these most rabid of fans might know every play in the playbook, but they know nothing about what football (in my opinion) should really be all about.  The stress these kids feel to not only win, but pulverize every opponent is much more than any 17-year-old should ever have to bear.<br /><br />The film basically takes us through the 1988 football season for the Panthers, from the first practice to the final game.  That first practice sets an ugly tone for what is to come, and things get even uglier when the team's star running back hurts his knee in the first game.  It will not be a perfect season in Odessa.  Losing, of course, brings out the worst in some people who were already pretty bad to begin with.  The parent of a chronic fumbler, already embarrassed that his son isn't following in his footsteps, pretty much goes off the deep end; the quarterback, living with an ailing mother and desperate for a scholarship that can take him away from this town, gets pushed pretty close to the breaking point, and the star player refuses to believe he is seriously injured because he can't imagine a life without football.  What of the coach, the enabler, the molder of young minds?  Billy Bob Thornton may be terrific in this film, but I never got inside the head of the coach he played.  In the end, I see him as perhaps the worst kind of coach you can have.  He's not honest with his team, he doesn't take care of his players, and he puts an obviously injured player back in action without even consulting either of the doctors who examined him.  He plays down expectations at times, but it's just an act; all too soon he is frothing at the mouth on the sidelines.  Some say he figures things out in the end, realizes that football is just a game, but I disagree.  That heartfelt talk with the quarterback: a cruel form of motivation; that half-time speech at the big game: more psychological motivation.  It's all about winning for him - that's my interpretation, at least.<br /><br />The film does have its moments, though.  When the injured superstar finally breaks down, it's more than a poignant moment - the film virtually stops right there; it's one of the most powerful scenes I've seen in a long time.  Other big moments, though, rubbed me the wrong way.  Having your father finally show something better than contempt for you is good, but the reason why it happens in this case sends a message I find quite wrong.<br /><br />This is definitely a film about high school football.  Academics, the very thing that high school is supposed to be all about, is nowhere to be found here - except in the reading problems of a certain star athlete and random comments about more money going to athletics than education.  As a full-fledged nerd, and as someone currently involved in education who has to hold his tongue when he sees luxurious athletics buildings erected on a campus desperately needing additional classrooms, I am going to have to stifle myself right here.  It does disappoint me a little bit to interpret this film the way I do - for, the way I see it, it ultimately says winning isn't everything - but it is pretty darn close.  Whatever its message, though, Friday Night Lights does make you think, and it is a gripping sports-related film, and that is more than enough to make it well worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A228JH8V9Y700G.html">A228JH8V9Y700G</a><br/><p>I am a woman.  I am a woman who doesn't follow sports much in real life, nor do I watch movies about sports.  The only reason I picked this up was because I have a thing for Garrett Hedlund as eye candy and I am a fan of Billy Bob Thornton.  I could care less about a football movie.  Still, this was a good movie.  Following in the footsteps of the great sports movies (The Natural, Rudy, Rocky, etc.), we are rooting for the underdog and feeling a great joy when someone triumphs over a great obsticle.<br /><br />We are following the 1988 high school football season of the Panthers in a small Texas town.  We are in America's heartland, Texas, a state that practically throbs with national pride and a love of football.  Football is important, and you feel the exuberance of all the star team members as they interact with the townsfolk and media.  Each has their own struggle, Garret Hedlund's probably being the most with an abusive father (Time McGraw) and his obvious popularity with the girls (gotta love that scene where the girl gives him a Rice Krispy sculpture!).  Billy Bob is a stereotypical hard nosed coach, gruff and demanding.  He pushes them as hard as he can.  And they triumph.<br /><br />A great feel good movie about overcoming.  It just happens to be a sports movie too.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Most sports fans claim to follow sports because it gives them an escape from the hum-drum routines of daily life.  "Friday Night Lights" tears that cliche to shreds as it proves that to too many people - both the athletes and the fans who adore them -- sports are the primary focus of daily life.<br /><br />Simultaneously obeying and transcending the traditions of the football movie, Peter Berg's "Friday Night Lights" follows the Permian High School football team through its 1988 season. ("FNL" is a slightly fictionalized version of the best-selling non-fiction book by Buzz Bissinger -- and the deviations are relatively minor.)  Odessa, a busted oil town in the sun-blasted plains of west Texas, has nothing going for it except high school football.  Thanks to the complete absence of opportunity in Odessa, the town is full of dreamers -- the kids who dream of a better life outside of Odessa, and the adults who dream of the kids' winning a state championship.<br /><br />Indeed, the town is singularly focused on winning the 5-A Texas state title.  The high school football coach (played with excellent reserve by Billy Bob Thornton, the only "star" in the movie) is the highest-paid employee in the school district.  The football stadium is, by far, the most expensive building in town, holding 20,000 people (every business in town closes during games).  And the players are gods, with high school girls literally falling at their feet.<br /><br />Several sub-plots involving specific players captivate the audience during the march to the state title (which commences with brutal two-a-day practices in the 110-degree August sunshine).  Two of the most riveting sub-plots involve Boobie Miles and Don Billingsley.  Boobie, the star running back with dreams of the NFL, may be the best player in the state and the history of the high school, but thanks to a cruel twist of fate has to come to terms with the fact that his destiny is more likely entwined with riding the back of a garbage truck than playing on TV on Sundays.  Don Billingsley has to confront his own athletic limitations -- he's never going to get a Division I scholarship -- as well as his drunken, violent father (played surprisingly well by country singer Tim McGraw).  There are other excellent stories told by this movie, as well.<br /><br />The football action scenes are shot very well -- these are real collisions rather than CGI special effects -- and at all times we believe we're watching the actors play football rather than stuntmen, even for the most brutal tackles and blocks.<br /><br />"FNL" does not limit itself to the perils of sports.  Look for some surprising moments of redemption as the squad moves closer and closer to its Holy Grail, the state championship -- I lost count of how many times the players and coaches were exhorted to "win state" by the townsfolk . . . and sometimes with more threat than encouragement.<br /><br />By casting a bunch of virtual no-name actors, "FNL" creates a sense of realism that makes the stories that much more powerful.  The young actors' lack of a pedigree does not diminish the truth contained in their performances -- like "City of God," "Friday Night Lights" proves that young, talented actors can be plucked out of thin air and work magic on the screen.<br /><br />The best sports movies, including "Hoosiers," "Bull Durham," and "The Bad News Bears," contain wisdom that cannot be found in other tales because sports, like it or not, dominate the American lifestyle.  "FNL" reminds us of the extent of this domination, both the bitter and the sweet, and that our devotion to sports comes at a price while paying some dividends as well.  A must-see for the high school athlete and the parents of the high school athlete.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CQON0P01BITL.html">A1CQON0P01BITL</a><br/><p>This is very good...even if you don't understand football!!!

The Panthers are a high school football team from Odessa, Texas, that at the start of the season looks like the strongest candidate to take the state championship. The high hopes are based in great part on the presence of Boobie Miles (Derek Luke) and his incredible ability for playing football. Not only can he play his position, running back, in excellent fashion, but he can also pass, receive, block, you name it. The offers from the most prestigious universities are pouring in, and he is at the top of the world. But everything comes tumbling down for him and for the Panthers when he gets a knee injury in the first game of the season.<br /><br />Now the responsibility falls on the shoulders of the rest of the team: an average quarterback, a supporting cast that was used to being "carried" by the star, and a coach that some people think is earning a salary that is too high. The burden is even larger, since each player has personal issues he has to deal with. For example, the QB Mike Winchell (Lucas Black) has to take care of his sick mother who has mental problems. Others have to endure the abuse by their fathers, who see themselves in the kids and push them beyond their limits.<br /><br />The movie succeeds in showing the significance of teamwork and of how important it is to believe on yourself. It also shows that in some town across the US, football is almost the only thing that counts, and high school kids end up carrying the hopes and dreams of the whole population, which given their age and maturity level may be considered unfair. A similar picture is presented in John Grisham book "Bleachers".<br /><br />As to the acting, the only person worth pointing out is Billy Bob Thornton, who as usual delivers a high quality performance. Luke and Black are the other actors that get a fair amount of "acting" time and provide us with acceptable performances. This is a good movie but it is definitely not among the best football films out there. 3.5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A22J9WI2PDAVJ.html">A22J9WI2PDAVJ</a><br/><p>"Friday Night Lights (2004)" is based on a true story. H.G. Bissinger is the author. Deep in the heart of West Texas nothing else matters when high school football is on. City versus city put their bragging rights on the line when high school rivalries clash. If you do not bring home the championship you are considered a loser!<br /><br />The 1988 Odessa Permian High School football team is followed for the year. Their trial and tribulations are documented to see what it takes for the quest of a championship ring. Four seniors take to the field for their final football season. The quarterback Mike Winchell (Lucas Black), Wide receiver Don Billingsley (Garret Hedlund), Safety Brian Chavez (Jay Hernandez) and running back Boobie Miles (Derek Luke) The state football championship is in their sights. And nothing less will suffice. Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thorton) is given advice from past players and boosters who actually won championships from previous years. And they will settle for nothing less than the championship ring.<br /><br />"Friday Night Lights" is filmed with in your face football action. The realistic action sequences bring this film to life. This leads to one drawback.  The film starts to focus more on the action scenes then bringing out the quality dramas that exist between the characters. The stress to perform for a city, players and parents could have been more developed. But Tim McGraw (Charles Billingsley) as the drunken parent of wide receiver Don Billingsley puts in a quality performance.<br /><br />Being from a small town myself I can relate to high school sports being on the front page of everyone. A state championship year can keep that expectation high for years to come. What if? This DVD is a quality football must see!</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>I thought this movie reflects in some way, the best and the worst of high school football have to offered. Its a very gritty look of the town, its people and how they played the game of football through their kids. It also a look of how these kids pursued their dreams of glory regardless of the cost. The movie centered around few characters from the team, to its coach, his quarterback, fumble inclined back up running back to a cocky superb running back who was injured.<br /><br />The movie have been watered down quite a bit from the book which must have angered the people of Odessa, Texas to no end when it was first published. I thought the feel was very authentic and it was successful in showing the rest of the world how seriously some people take high school football. (Probably no more then how many people in other parts of the world take soccer so seriously or in Japan where high school baseball take on mythical level.)<br /><br />Billy Bob Thornton did an excellent job portarying the head coach, Gary Grimes. In fact, he have been watered down from the book version pretty considerably. Lucus Black playes Boobie Miles very well. Of course, this is not exactly a very likable character in the beginning. Shallow, uneducated braggart who represent all that was wrong with star high school football player who only think football. Many in the audience reacted to his injury on the field with certain satisfaction. But ironically, Miles character developed into something truly worthy after he realized that his playing time was over and it was interesting to see this shallow braggart developed into a whole human being.<br /><br />I initially thought that this was another "Hoosier" type of movie but I was mistaken. The movie tries to do many things on different levels but overall, it was an indellible movie about kids in sports.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>When comparing sports films, some might be able to see why I gave this movie only three stars. But I'm also basing my rating on more than just previous film success weighing in against this one. There were good and bad portions of this production that stabilized my review at three stars, too.<br /><br />Since I'm an optomist (mostly), let's start with the good:<br /><br />Billy Bob Thornton was excellent, as always, in his main role as coach Gaines, as was Lucas Black as quarterback Mike Winchell. Both played believable characters and showed the stresses put onto their shoulders by family, friends, and the obsessive townsfolk.<br /><br />I also enjoyed Derek Luke who played Boobie Miles, the #1 running back for this little East Texas town. He rules the playing field until fate strikes him down ...and then the team has to become a real team, relying on the whole and not the individual.<br /><br />But there were some problems with other aspects of this movie that soured its possible five star glory.<br /><br />Most notably was Tim McGraw's character, who played a washed up drunken father who'd won a Texas State Championship ring during his formative high school years. Initially, I didn't have a problem with Mr. McGraw's performance as he aggressively taunts his son, trying to make him become the "perfect" player. He's not a very nice character, and I think that's the way it should have stayed. But the ending tried to candy-coat him and his son's relationship, and that made the entire portion of Mr. McGraw's portrayal unbelievable. At least it did that for me.<br /><br />I also feel that the David and Goliath battles have been overdone in film noir (ad nauseum). Although some of them (see below) are adequate to the situation being filmed, I felt this movie went a bit over-the-top.<br /><br />I've mentioned other famous sports films that I feel are much better than this one, and will probably hold up better over time. #1 among them is Hoosiers, the infamous Indiana basketball movie staring Gene Hackman. #2 would be Raging Bull ('nough said). #3 would be Rocky (the original Rocky, not the sequels). #4 is the lesser known Mystery Alaska, which I found to be extremely funny and heart-warming.<br /><br />I'm sure some reviewers out there have different favorites, and when compared against this film, I'm sure they might see how this one was quite a bit weaker than their other coveted sports movies.<br /><br />That's how I see it anyway ...</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Even if you don't enjoy (or understand) football, you'll still like this movie which comes more as a story of live than one of a game.</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>...if it hadn't pulled its punches: I pretty much have to agree with the review in Salon.com (which you can find at rottentomatoes.com), this film is brilliantly shot and acted, but the director cops out halfway through and turns it into just another sports-as-character-formation cliche.<br /><br />The first half of the film touches on some uncomfortable truths about high school (and collegiate) football: that too many people, esp. in tiny backwater towns where nothing else ever happens, live vicariously through them and therefore place an ungodly and uhealthy amount of pressure on the kids playing it.  That these types of towns and schools have their priorities ass-backwards when they funnel all of their resources into their sports programs and exorbitant stadiums rather than education, which shortchanges the other 95% of the students who DON'T play sports.  That these teenage gladiators get put on a social pedestal but often end up getting the short end of the stick because they are given a free ride through school and therefore get very little real education, i.e. very little real-life job prospects if they fail (as 99% do) to make it into the NFL.  The clincher is the ending credits when there are little blurbs about what each player ended up doing later in life---the sensational star running back (aptly nicknamed "Boobie") is vaguely listed as "now living in Somesuch Small Town in Texas with his two kids" instead of describing what sort of menial job he likely ended up with whereas all his other teammates' blurbs do include their job descriptions.<br /><br />However, if you can detach yourself from those painfully obvious realities and evasions, this is still a very entertaining film, better than any other football film I can remember.<br /><br />This film could've been a scathing and courageous indictment of the cult of spectator sports; instead it settles on being just another validation of that toxic subculture.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This 2004 film is based on a true story of one year in the 1980s when the Odessa, Texas High School Football Team competed for the state championship.  Billy Bob Thornton is the coach and his acting, as usual, is excellent.  So is that of the cast of young men who play the football players.  It's easy to see why their whole lives are wrapped up in winning this championship.  There's nothing else in this town that will ever give them any glory.  This is their moment and they have to use it to the maximum.<br /><br />This point is brought out over and over again - that for these boys - there is no life other than football.  It is especially demonstrated in the relationship of one of the boys and his father.  The father is an abusive drunk who treats the boy badly because the boy fumbles the ball. It seems that years before, the father was on a winning team and won a state championship ring.  After that, his life had no meaning and he truly believed that if the boy didn't come out of this football season a winner, there would be no other way for the boy to be able to succeed.<br /><br />The script was good and did hold my interest but I felt I had seen it all before.  There's the best player on the team who sustains an injury.  There's the competition between the boys. There's a social life of sorts.  And, of course, there is the tough-love coach who encourages them throughout.<br /><br />The script is good too, maintaining the tension throughout.<br /><br />Sorry though.  I was bored.  Maybe it's because I'm not a football lover.  Maybe it's because even though I understood how much the game meant to the boys, I'm just too far away from the Odessa Texas lifestyle to really feel their passion in my gut. It was a good film too.  Just not for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>My Gawd, I love football.<br /><br />'Tis a sport that offers the purest microcosm of life:  Play as a team--succeed; play as individuals--fail. Those of us who have strapped on the pads and grunted and groaned in the trenches know this incontrovertible truth all too well.  A single unit is much greater than the sum of all its individual parts, and this stellar truism is manifested magnificently in Peter Berg's sensational film FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS.<br /><br />Again, I love football, and I particularly enjoy football movies that capture the grit and dark hubris of the sport, but this film stands alone in its overwhelming ability to portray a game, a west Texas town, its residents, its players, and its shameless addiction to the gridiron to a degree that transcends every single facet of human existence.  In a community intoxicated with football, in a culture intoxicated with football, in an infrastructure that lives, eats, breaths, and sleeps football, the 1988 Odessa Permian Panthers are about to embark on a spectacular odyssey that will catapult and devour them at the same time:  a magical, mystical season taking the coaches and players up and down the peaks and valleys of high school sports nirvana.<br /><br />This is a film that garners attention to itself for infinite reasons.  A great story, based on a bestselling book.  Cinematography second to none, thanks to Tobias A. Schliessler, that gives the movie its gritty, handheld, "documentary" feel.  A fast-paced, action-packed, totally believable series of scenes, augmented by an absolute killer soundtrack.  And acting--oh yes, some very convincing, authentic, been-there-done-that acting.<br /><br />As great as this film is, it is enhanced by the talents of the players who bring west Texas football to life before our very eyes:  Lucas Black as a scowling, brooding, ultimately insecure quarterback Mike Winchell; Derek Luke as the budding NFL superstar "Boobie" Miles, whose knee injury derails his career and summons one of the most poignant scenes in the film; Jay Hernandez as steady, reliable Brian Chavez; and Billy Bob Thornton as Coach Gary Gaines.  Thornton is a gifted actor, but this is perhaps his best role, as he portrays a man obsessed with getting his team to the pinnacle of success--yet disgusted with the one-dimensional, win-at-all-costs mentality of his current gig.  Thornton is flawless; he does exceptional work.<br /><br />Three other characters moved me, and moved me considerably.  Perhaps, because I can readily identify with all of them.  Garrett Hedlund plays Odessa tailback Don Billingsley--a troubled soul because his father, a former jock (Tim McGraw) refuses to accept his son's perceived inattentiveness and does nothing more than relive his own glory days two decades before.  I know so many men who suffer exactly from the same malady, and could readily identify with the character, despite his shortcomings.  Yet, at the end of the film, when troubled father and son reconcile problematically, I was very much affected.<br /><br />Finally, I identified with "Preacher," the stoic, silent, solid defensive end from Permian, played by a somber-faced Lee Jackson.  He went through the hell of two-a-days, saying nothing.  He went through the trials and tribulations of the regular season, saying nothing.  He saw games won, games lost, players come, players go, but still his resolve was not shaken, and at last--during halftime of Permian's game against very formidable Dallas Carter for the state championship--he released his fury and anguish to his teammates to fight and scrap and persevere, the character rose above the din and ruckus to prove, very admirably, how sports is, once again, a splendid microcosm of life.<br /><br />FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is a whirling Texas twister of entertainment.  The film is priceless; the DVD extras remarkable.  This product is quality entertainment, top to bottom.  Highly, highly, highly recommended.<br /><br />--D. Mikels, author, WALK-ON</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>Ever since Peter Bogdanovich, in THE LAST PICTURE SHOW, provided a comic view of a small town's total involvement in the fortunes of a high school football team (remember the verbal abuse the locals heaped on Jeff Bridges and Timothy Bottoms when they lost the 'big game'?), Hollywood has attempted, with varying degrees of success, to make the 'definitive' small town/football film.<br /><br />Director Peter Berg has finally done it, with FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS!<br /><br />Based on H. G. Bissinger's best-selling tale of the 1988 season of  the Odessa (Texas) 'Permian Panthers', the film unflinchingly paints a vivid canvas of a school and community obsessed with winning, as football provides the only release from poverty and desperation. While the concept is reminiscent of Tom Cruise's earlier ALL THE RIGHT MOVES, Berg doesn't glamorize the hero or tie things up, neatly, at the climax; in real life, while victories are savored, they are, at best, a temporary 'high'...while defeats can drive rational people into irrational frenzies. The Panthers' fortunes are such a crutch to Odessa's emotional well-being, that each game becomes a narcotic 'fix' for the entire community...a situation potentially dangerous for the players, and their coaches.<br /><br />While Billy Bob Thornton has received the bulk of media attention, as the stern but fair head coach (with glowing reviews for BAD SANTA, and THE ALAMO, Thornton is having a career-defining year!), the film is really an ensemble work, with stand-out performances by Lucas Black, Derek Luke, Garrett Hedlund, and, surprisingly, singer Tim McGraw (as Hedlund's 'reliving past glories' father). The entire cast is exceptional, avoiding the easy pitfalls of simply playing stereotypes.<br /><br />At times brutal and gritty, at times nearly surrealistic, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS refuses to fall into the clich&eacute;s that marred VARSITY BLUES and THE PROGRAM, eschewing the artsy but smug self-righteousness of Oliver Stone's ANY GIVEN SUNDAY, as well.<br /><br />This may well be the finest football film ever made...as well as one of the most honest portrayals of life in a small town.<br /><br />I will be surprised if it doesn't make most critics' 'Ten Best' lists, at year's end, and is a major Oscar contender.<br /><br />Peter Berg has gotten the formula right!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I live in Minnesota, where high school hockey is the state religion and the right of passage for seniors is to go to the State Tournament, even if there school does not make it that far.  Parents (not just fathers) send their sons to live in other school districts so they can get more playing time or play with a better team.  Everyone who has seen "Hoosiers" know that in Indiana it is high school basketball that is the subject of such devotion, but if you needed to see "Friday Night Lights" to know that neither of those state religions holds a candle to high school football in Texas, then you are just not a true sports fan.  Even before H.G. Bissinger's Pulitzer Prize winning book, "Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team and a Dream," I knew the people of West Texas took their high school football seriously (I lived in New Mexico when I went to high school, so it would have been hard not to notice).<br /><br />Director Peter Berg's film version of "Friday Night Lights" is based on the true story of the Odessa-Permian Panthers and their 1988 season.  What "true" means in this case is that the name of the coach and the key players are accurate, as are the number of losses the Panthers had that year (although the scores are different, as is one of the opponents).  Overall, the film avoids going Hollywood until the final game, which does manage to be true to the spirit of the film even if it requires a stupid play call to help things along (I am sorry, but if it is 4th down and half the length of a football to go, and your offensive line outweighs the defense by at least 50 pounds a person, you call a quarterback sneak and get a least a yard more than you need just by firing off the ball; at least, that is what my father has always told me and since he played college football for an undefeated team, Trinity in Connecticut, I tend to listen to him).<br /><br />This film affirms, for the upteenth time, that the main thing wrong with sports involving kids are the adults, either in the form of the parents, or the concerned citizens whose support of coach is based primarily on the score of the last game.  The prototypical parent in this story is Charles Billingsley (Tim McGraw), who has his state championship ring and makes it clear that his son, Don (Garrett Hedlund), will be a failure if he does not do the same.  Unfortunately, Don has a tendency to fumble, so Charles has no problem going down onto the field during practice to set the boy straight.  Is Don playing football for his dad or despite his dad?  There is no easy answer to that question, because life, family, and football are all wrapped up together in Odessa, Texas.  The town might be mired in an economic depression, but that does not stop them from having a football stadium bigger than what some colleges and universities enjoy.<br /><br />Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) is supposed to go undefeated and win the state championship.  Perham has done this four times before, in 1965, 1976, 1980, and 1984.  Apparently they have a four year crop rotation program going and everybody in town can do the math to figure out 1988 is going to be the year.  When the Boobie Miles (Derek Luke) the star running back gets hurt the coach gets the blame even though it is clear, like in a classic Greek tragedy, that the Fates are punishing the sin of hubris.  Boobie is all ready to spend his money for playing in the NFL and he has not even picked a college yet.  Basking in his stardom, Boobie gladly admits to reporters that he gets straight A's because he is an athlete and as he leaves defenders in the wake of his sweet moves you can understand why he is the most important play for Permian.  But the goddess of mischief hides the helmet of his backup Chris Comer (Lee Thompson Young), and everybody knows that when you are running the score up and keep your superstar in the game, somebody is going to go gunning for him.<br /><br />There are several key factors that make "Friday Night Lights" work.  The first is Thornton's performance, which is yet another reminder that he is one of the finest film actors around today.  His Coach Gaines goes between moments of screaming at his players in the grand tradition of football coaches going back to Knute Rockne and beyond and measured silences as he endures another rabid fan excoriating him on talk radio or the "For Sale" signs that have sprung up in his front yard after a loss.  But there are also moments when the speaks from the heart, whether it is to his quarterback, Mike Winchell (Lucas Black) in the squalid home the kid shares with his mentally disturbed mother (Connie Cooper), or the final halftime speech to his team.  What distinguishes Gaines from every other man in the story is that he knows that in the end, football is just a game.  He just has to be careful about who he shares this particular bit of wisdom with during the season.<br /><br />Berg makes a brilliant decision to shoot this story as if it were a documentary.  This works well in the extended game sequences, but suits the rest of the film as well, which is important because the most important moments in "Friday Night Lights" come at other times.  Some of the best scenes take place away from the lighted field as Boobie and his uncle (Grover Coulson) deal with the disappearance of the dream during a visit to a doctor, when the garbage truck makes it rounds, and when the kid cleans out his locker.  This leads to the third key factor, which is that we care about the kids that the story focuses on, including the silent "Preacher" (Lee Jackson) and the kid who is going to Harvard to become a lawyer, Brain Chavez (Jay Hernandez).  We do not care about the fans or the families or the rest of the town, just the kids, and their performances match those of Thornton in providing a realism that we just do not get in most of the films in the sports genre.<br /><br />I really liked this movie until the end, where the action and the emotions smack too much of Hollywood, not to mention David versus Goliath, than what had been established up to that point.  Still, in the end Berg focuses exactly where he should, on the kids who have finished their high school football careers and the coach who has to immediately start planning for next year, when Odessa-Permian would again undertake the sacred quest for perfection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>Ever wonder why those midwestern universities - Texas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, etc -  seem to be so obsessed with football? Watching FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, based on the book of the same title by H.G. Bissinger about the 1988 season of the Odessa  (Texas) Permian Panthers high school team, we learn that the fixation is acquired early in life, especially if the town has nothing else going for it but prairie grass or, in the case of Odessa, stinky oil wells.<br /><br />Billy Bob Thornton, as the Panthers' head coach Gary Gaines, gives what may be the first Oscar-worthy performance of the 2004 film season. Odessa expects the Panthers to win the state championship, and no excuses for failure are acceptable. As Coach Gaines admonishes his players:<br /><br />"You have the responsibility of protecting this team and this school and this town."<br /><br />Yes, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is about football (and contains some of the best gridiron action you'll ever see outside of the real thing), but, in a larger arena, it's a commentary on the almost crushing pressure on teenage athletes to win the Big One for town, school, friends, and family. It could just as well be about baseball, basketball, or ice hockey.<br /><br />At the outset, Gaines builds his offense around a single, star running back, Boobie Miles (Derek Luke). But after Miles is seriously injured early on and lost to the team for the season, the burden falls on senior quarterback Mike Winchell (Lucas Black) and the fumble-prone running back, Don Billingsley (Garret Hedlund). Winchell's focus is hindered by the realization that going off to college will force him to leave behind his dependent mother. On the other hand, the hapless Billingsley is constantly browbeaten by his abusive father Charles (CW singer Tim McGraw), once himself a player on a champion Panther squad, who can't understand why Don is so inept and fears that his son may squander the only chance he'll ever have for the memory of a fleeting glory in an otherwise unremarkable life. However, Derek Luke provides the film's undeniably most powerful scene - worthy a Best Supporting nod by itself - when he emotionally breaks down under the realization that he can no longer do the only thing he's good at, i.e. play football.<br /><br />FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is undoubtedly a Guy Flick. While my wife wasn't exactly bored in the cinema seat, she can't understand why I'm rating the film so highly. It's partly because of Billy Bob's superb performance, but also because it's lean and hard-hitting film about boys being shoved into manhood by pressures beyond their control. In another era, the film would have been about young men forged in the hell of armed combat. Here, it's just west Texas.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>I have read so many spectacular reviews of the TV series FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHT that I decided that I needed to watch the series myself.  But I first wanted to see the film that the TV series was based upon.<br /><br />This is a carefully crafted film about the somewhat dubious role that football is allowed to play in the lives of small town Americans.  What many people seem to miss in seeing the film is the deeply critical aspects of the film.  While the struggles of Permian High School to overcome the loss of their star player Boobie Miles -- who is portrayed as a 1988 high school equivalent of today's Darren McFadden of Arkansas (like McFadden, Miles is portrayed as someone who is spectacularly fast, a great receiver, and even an accomplished passer) -- take center stage, there is also a quiet but pervasive criticism of the role that football is allowed to play in people's lives in this small town.  There is the sadness of several former players who have never been able to find meaning in their lives after hanging up their cleats.  There is also the poignancy of people utterly obsessed with the failure or success of the local high school team, as if there was some connection between the quality of their lives and the fate of the team.  From the beginning to the end of the movie there is a sense that these are people without lives, so that while on one level we celebrate the victories of the team on another we experience a deep sadness.  I kept thinking of something Kierkegaard wrote while watching the movie.  He distinguished between the comic and the tragic, characterizing the latter as regarding with finite interest that which ought to be of eternal interest, while identifying the comic as regarding something finite as of eternal interest.  In this sense, the movie is at its heart a tragicomedy.  The movie doesn't explore precisely why these people have such sad lives, but it leaves no question at the end that they do.<br /><br />This is a very slick movie, which is impressive given that it was essentially a low budget film (it was made for around $30 million) with a very large cast.  As a result the film has pretty much a no name cast, the only actor that most people would be familiar with being Billy Bob Thornton.  But the film never reveals its low budget.  From beginning to end every aspect is highly polished.<br /><br />I mentioned the way that the movie criticizes our obsession with football and how this obsession is contrasted with the fundamental emptiness in the lives of the characters in the film.  The two characters who most display these aspects of the film are the aforementioned Boobie Miles and former star Charles Billingsley, played by country music star Tim McGraw.  The only thing that Miles has going for him at the start of the film is his athletic ability and as we hear him struggling to read a recruiting letter we realize that he is borderline illiterate.  When he learns that his knee injury is far worse than anyone imagined he realizes how little life has to offer him.  He is a man with rapidly collapsing horizons.  Billingsley, on the other hand, has only his memories of having starred for Permian.  He relentlessly drives his son to achieve a similar kind of success so that he can relive some of it vicariously.<br /><br />This film in the end is not a celebration of football, but a paean on our excessive obsession with what is, in the end, only a game.  It does not mean that football is devoid of all redeeming values, but it does mean to point out that there is more to life than football.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>"Friday Night Lights", the inspiration for the 2006-2007 TV series of the same name, is an unflinchingly look at a small, economically-depressed Texas town where the only exciting event is the Friday night high school football game.  That kind of spotlight creates intense expectations for the Permian High School Football Team to succeed, causing players to make tough choices and live with the consequences.<br /><br />Billy Bob Thornton does an inspiring turn as the football coach who rallies the team after a season-ending injury to a key player.  His leadership and mentoring of the team causes the players to come together and make the best of their situation and of each other.  The movie avoids a cliche ending but leaves the viewer with the sense that what the players accomplish together will be with them all their lives.<br /><br />This film is highly recommended as an excellent capture of high school sports as preparation for the challenges of adult life.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>This is probably the best football movie I've ever seen. Based on the nonfiction book, the story follows a Texas High School through their 1988 season as they try to win a state championship. The pressure put on the players by the entire town is unreal. They can't go anywhere without someone asking them if they're going all the way or  someone showing them their ring from when they won state. The night they lose their first game, the coaches yard is littered with 'For Sale' signs. The town is anything but subtle.<br /><br />The movie is well written and acted showing each of the players as a real person and you experience all the pressure their under. Tim McGraw does an excelent job as an overly critical father of a son who can't stop fumbling the ball. The final game has some of the best  football scenes I've ever seen in a movie. I never read the book so I didn't know the outcome of the game and found myself on the edge of my seat rooting for them to pull it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Based upon the best-selling nonfiction book of the same name, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is the story about Odessa, Texas's high school's bid for a state football championship in the fall of 1988.  The movie follows the lives of key members of the team as they begin their summer training through their season that comes to a dramatic conclusion at the Astrodome.  Odessa is a small town and doesn't offer many future prospects for the students who live there.  Most of them come from troubled backgrounds, for example quarterback Mike Winchell's (Lucas Black) mother is sick and dying and Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund) lives with an emotionally abusive alcoholic father.  Nevertheless, hopes and expectations are high for the Permian "MOJO" Panthers and Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton).  The town wants perfection, meaning a perfect season with a state title.  Coach Gaines wants perfection, too, but he defines it differently.  For him, perfection means giving it all; it is a way of life.  The Panthers start off the season strong, lead by Winchell and star tailback Boobie Miles (Derek Luke).  But then tragedy strikes, distilling the peace and threatening to destroy even Coach Gaines' definition of perfection.<br /><br />FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is one of the better team football movies that I have seen.  The action on the field is very realistic.  That is in part due to some actual footage of Permian football games that were sliced in with filmed footage from the movie.  However, much of the realism comes from the attitude of the characters.  If you've never been to Texas or Oklahoma and have never played football or personally known someone who has, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is an incredibly depressing movie to watch.  The film has been made that way because FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS isn't really supposed to be about football, but it's supposed to be about the characters in the movie.  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is really a movie about the friendships between a group of close high school friends.<br /><br />Yet, it is a football movie.  I never played football myself, but I generally like watching football movies.  RUDY and INVICIBLE are great films to watch.  They aren't as uplifting, but I also enjoyed ANY GIVEN SUNDAY, THE PROGRAM, and VARSITY BLUES as well as comical dramas like THE LONGEST YARD.  However, as much as I enjoy watching these films, they are nothing like real football in a small town.  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is.  It's a very realistic film that illustrates how much the game means to many people and if you are connected to the sport at all, it seems a little insane.  For example, in FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS more money is spent on the football team than the rest of a school district's budget combined, the game is followed as a religion, and the biggest moments expected to happen in a person's life are during the Friday night lights of the football season of their senior year.  I realize for many people all of that sounds incredible, but in many parts of the country those things are a way of life.  Priorities might be out of line, the people might be misguided, and living like that seems incredibly depressing, but it's all very real.<br /><br />In short, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is one of the most realistic football movies ever made.  Highly recommended for football fans, citizens of Texas, anyone who read the book, and people who favor dramas scattered with a little sport action.<br /><br />A couple of trivia pieces:  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS features country singer Tim McGraw in his motion picture debut.  Also, Connie Britton who plays Coach Gaines' wife, Sharon, is also the same actress who plays Coach Eric Taylor's (Kyle Chandler) wife Tami on the television series FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS.<br /><br />An extra on the DVD is the short documentary "The Story of the 1988 Permian Panthers." This featurette is a look back at the 1988 season with some of the real life players from that 1988 team, including Boobie Miles, Mike Winchell, Brian Chavez and Don Billingsley.  Real footage from some of their games as well as television interviews and news pieces about the team are seen.  I really enjoyed this featurette. It's the best extra on the DVD.<br /><br />Other extras include the usual directors commentary, deleted scenes, a brief conversation with Tim McGraw about acting, a behind the scenes personal video entitled "Player Cam", and a comment from director Peter Berg about the reasoning why he added the scene at the burger joint.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>The idea of the inspirational sports drama is not a new one.  It has been ravaging havoc in the cinemas since the dawn of time, and while they are truly a dime a dozen, there is rarely a film that actually captures the very meaning and essence of the sport it is championing.  All too often the films are littered with so much saccharine `goodness' that the whole point of the story is bogged down by clich&eacute;d Hollywood atmosphere.  They all wind up blurring together in a long line of disposable, familiar, sports movies.<br /><br />There is no oomph!<br /><br />That is why I absolutely love this movie.  `Friday Night Lights' is not your typical sports drama.  Stripped down and basically bare to the bone, this film is as rough and tough as they come.  With the grit needed to really pack a punch to the gut, and the emotional core to elevate this from the ashes that are every other sports film, `Friday Night Lights' is a shining beacon on the game that has become the lives of so many.<br /><br />This is one of the only sports films to actually make the sport the leading character.<br /><br />The film is based on the true story of a high school football team in West Texas.  The team consists of your `typical' members, from the star player (who happens to be black) to the quarterback struggling to leave his home-life off the field, to the careless rebel suffering at the hands of an abusive father.  INSTEAD of playing to each clich&eacute; like it was the saving grace of the film, and exploiting each storyline for each tear it can muster, this film allows the players lives to further embellish the power of the game itself, breathing life onto the field, where it belongs.  Instead of focusing our attention on how these young men are going to patch up their lives off the field, we are brought to the sobering realization that if they don't patch their lives up ON the field, their lives are basically worthless.<br /><br />This game is EVERYTHING to them, and you feel that in your soul.<br /><br />With an onslaught of powerful performances from Lucas Black, Garrett Hedlund and Derek Luke, as well as an amazingly moving turn by country superstar Tim McGraw, `Friday Night Lights' has not a single wrong note.  As the film draws to its dramatic and heartbreaking climax there is a moment where everything seems lost and broken only to have it all come together in the most meaningful and appropriate of ways.  It isn't forced, it isn't out of place and it isn't sappy; it is just right.<br /><br />Yes, I cried.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PXHFGJZBNLXB.html">A2PXHFGJZBNLXB</a><br/><p>I had to write a review of Peter Berg's FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS for the Rutgers University New Brunswick newspaper, the Daily Targum, and I think, by giving it a lukewarm review, I might have underrated it a little.<br /><br />In my newspaper review, I had complained about a lack of character development in the movie, saying that I didn't really feel deeply involved in these characters as perhaps I should have. And when you watch FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, you might feel a similar kind of emotional distance. By the final game, I wasn't really rooting for the Permian High Panthers to win; instead, I felt more like one of the spectators, objectively and dispassionately watching an event unfold. I admit, I was left a little cold by the movie at first.<br /><br />But, thinking about it since writing that review, I think I've come to appreciate its strengths much more strongly. FRIDAY NIGHTS LIGHTS is less about football, and maybe even less about its individual characters, than it is in portraying, with searing authenticity, how an economically-depressed small town like Odessa, Texas puts all their hopes and dreams on their high school football team. Thus, there are many scenes that have only the barest wisp of a connection to football, but instead show some of the individual players living their own lives. Don Billingsley, for instance, has to deal with an occasionally abusive drunkard father (played by Tim McGraw, in a surprisingly effective performance) who tells him straight out that if he and his team doesn't win the championship, there's not much left to look forward to in Odessa. And then there is the poor coach, Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton), who has to deal with similar kinds of pressure from nearly a whole town. Scenes like the one in which Coach Gaines is stopped by some rude townspeople in front of a shopping mall all vividly show a town that has become so attached to their high school football team that their reasons for living---at least in Odessa---become tied to the team. That is what FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is about, and the way Peter Berg explores their subject---the sometimes-brutal character scenes, the vivid realism, the slightly washed-out quality to the film's colors that seem to comment on the town's loneliness---gives the movie a disturbing quality that goes far beyond the usual feel-good sports movie. (And the ending of this story is much more emotionally complex than is usual in these kinds of movies.)<br /><br />FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS may not be a great movie, but it is definitely about something much more than just football. It's about how desperate people can project their hopes and dreams on something even as trivial as high school football. Despite my misgivings about the way the moviemakers approached the characters in the film, I think overall FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is worth a look. Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>I had heard nothing but good things about "Friday Night Lights" before going to see the film for myself.  As a teenager, I attended a school with a similiar love of football, so this movie really hit home for me.  "Friday Night Lights" manages to take the viewer into the action better than most football movies to date.<br /><br />The movie starts off a little fuzzy, adding the documentary type effect, but after a third of the movie has passed, it takes on a more professional Hollywood big film feel.<br /><br />The acting is good.  The storyline is not only true but works well on the big screen.  Billy Bob Thorton, besides having been married to the most beautiful woman in the world, is a also a great actor.  He does a great job not over-acting in this film.  Many actors would have not have been able to pull this role off.  But Billy Bob makes the true-life character Coach Gary Gaines come across quite well.<br /><br />The on-the-field scenes are very realistic, and the movie manages to throw in "touching" moments and a few "funny" parts.  All of the young actors did a great job of making the situations seem believable and also managed to not over-act their parts.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie top any football fan.  It delivers the goods.<br /><br />For parents...their are a few sexually explicit scenes, so use discretion.  Send little ones for popcorn when the scene starts to get a little heavy.<br /><br />See ya next review</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Friday Night Lights" is powerful and excellent! This movie is based on a true story about a high school football team in Odessa, Texas in 1988 that chronicles one important season in the lives of the players, their coach, and the rest of the people in the town. Billy Bob Thornton (who recently seen as Davy Crockett in "The Alamo" (2004) and also starred as Karl Childers in his directorial debut "Sling Blade" (1996) plays Coach Gary Gaines, the high school football team's coach. Derek Luke (who played Antwone Fisher in "Antwone Fisher" (2002) plays Jimmy "Boobie" Miles, the star player and tailback for the team. Jay Hernandez (who recently starred as Keith Perez in "Ladder 49" (2004) plays Brian Chavez, the fullback for the team. Lucas Black (who also starred with Billy Bob Thornton as Frank Wheatley in Thornton's directorial debut "Sling Blade" (1996), plays Mike Winchell, the team's quarterback. Garrett Hedlund (who recently starred in "Troy" (2004) as Don Billingsley, the team's linebacker. Lee Thompson Young as Chris Comer, the team's third string tailback. And in his film debut, Tim McGraw, as Charles Billingsley, Don's father and former high-school football player. The cast is excellent. Thornton gives an excellent performance as Gaines and it is one of the best performances of his career. Luke gives an mesmerizing performance as Boobie Miles, and it also is one of the best performances of his career, thus far. Black gives an powerful performance as Winchell, and it also is of the best performances of his career, thus far. Hedlund gives an superb performance as Don Billingsley, and it also is one of the best performances of his career, thus far. Hernandez gives an pitch-perfect performance as Chavez, and it also is one of the best performances of his career, thus far. Tim McGraw, making his film debut, as Charles Billingsley, gives an mind-blowing performance, and it also is one of the best performances of any actor this year, even if he is a country singer, it proves that he is an excellent actor. All of the actors give Oscar-worthy performances, especially, Thornton, McGraw, Luke, and Black. This is an excellent sports movie, that is one of the best sport movies of its kind and it is one of the year's best. The directing by Peter Burg (who also co-wrote the screenplay) is superb and excellent. This is his best movie he's directed, thus far. He also directed last year's hit "The Rundown" (2003), which starred The Rock. The screenplay by David Aaron Cohen (who also wrote the screenplay to "The Devil's Own" (1997) & Peter Burg, based on the book by H.G. Bissinger, who is, weirdly enough, Burg's 2nd cousin, is excellent. The music by Explosions In The Sky is excellent. The cinematography by Tobias A. Schliessler (who also did the cinematography to Berg's hit "The Rundown" (2003) is excellent. The film editing by Colby Parker Jr. & David Rosenbloom (who recently film edited "The Last Shot" (2004). He also film edited "The Recruit" (2003), "Hart's War" (2002), "Pay It Forward" (2000), "Frequency" (2000), "The Insider" (1999), "Deep Impact" (1998), "The Peacemaker" (1997) & "Primal Fear" (1996) is excellent. The casting by Janet Hirshenson & Jane Jenkins is excellent. The production design by Sharon Seymour (who production designed "Bad Santa" (2003) which also starred Billy Bob Thornton, is excellent. The costume design by Susan Matheson is excellent. The art direction by Peter Borck (who recently art directed "Breakin' All The Rules" (2004). He also art directed "Bad Santa" (2003) is excellent. The set decoration by Carla Curry (who recently set decorated "The Alamo" (2004). She also art decorated the upcoming "Walk The Line" (2005) & "The Wendell Baker Story" (2004) is excellent. The football stunts coordinated by Allan Graf is excellent. This is superb, excellent, riveting, touching, powerful, and mesmerizing. Go see it for yourself, if you want to.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>I've never been a big fan of sports but I have enjoyed far too many sports films. Some of them I came across quite by accident or due to friend's recommendations. Others I had to see because of where I lived (HOOSIERS was directed by local resident transplanted to LA David Anspaugh). The fact is that while I never enjoyed the sports so much, I always appreciated what it was that was going on. And the movies made about sports have for the most part always turned out well.<br /><br />But this movie takes things one step further than most. It gets to the heart of the game as well as the downside without using the usual contrivances of most films. Some may appear to be those, but upon closer examination you can find the differences. The big game, the problematic team member, the tough as nails coach. All are here but not quite like you may have seen them before.<br /><br />Billy Bob Thornton stars as coach Gary Gaines, the coach of the Permian High Panthers from Odessa, TX. The town of Odessa worships the ground that their players walk on. Why? Because there is nothing or little else to do or find in Odessa.<br /><br />This year the team has the chance to make it all the way, to be the state champs. And all hopes are residing on the shoulders of one player, Boobie Miles (Derek Luke), a player who is not only filled with talent but with an ego to match. The team rallies behind Boobie and knows that they are going to win. That is until an injury sidelines Boobie...for good.<br /><br />Now if the team is to make it, they must work together and work hard to get there. The battle is not one won by an individual, but won by the team. And each and every one works in their own way to get there.<br /><br />The film offers us glimpses into the lives of the players, but none to the extent that the story becomes each individual's. Instead, it shows their trial and tribulation but keeps coming back to the team and the efforts they make to become winners. Rather than become absorbed in the off the field dramas of each, the film focuses on what goes on ON the field. It is perhaps the best shot look at football on the field that I have seen.  It draws you in and places you on the field with the team, rooting for them all the way.<br /><br />You feel it all in this film. The pressures to perform coming from coach and community, the need to win, the desire to be their best, the confusion of becoming a "star" in the local school and community that is passed on to these gridiron heroes. And right smack in the middle of it all is the heart that beats loud and clear, the heart that shows these youngsters were there not for the fame and glory but because they felt the need within themselves to be their best.<br /><br />The film is based on the best seller by author H.G.Bissinger and based on the true story. While I am certain an amount of liberties were taken with this book, the soul is very much seen on film. One great extra on the DVD is the inclusion of a look at the players as they are today. The question of what happened to Boobie Miles after his misfortune is answered as are what became of the other teammates involved. The movie is part touching, part sports like violence and part examination of what goes on in the lives of teen sports heroes. But above all else, it is a movie that draws you in and holds you tight until the clock ticks down the final seconds of the game.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UX5ABICURKL5.html">A2UX5ABICURKL5</a><br/><p>This is a great movie, cause it deals with a football team I never got to play.<br />But they were our ticket to state, we were not good enough to get to them<br />in the playoffs or it maybe we were good enough, but we just didn't try hard enough.<br />Out where these people live these people live for football.<br />I remember back in the 90's these 2 teams were in the news alot.<br />A must see, I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>Living in Texas it's almost a right of passage to watch this film.  A true story it's sure a touching one when you see what these young men with subject themselves to for a trophy because it's so much more than that.  I watched this film with a good friend who was brought to tears.  This is a film, not about football but about comrodery, about devotion and dreams and acheiving those dreams through devotion and yes, comrodery.  What's starts off somewhat like a documentary on 'making the team' or 'meeting the team' turns into a heart tugging event as you watch these young men go through quite a bit in order to realize their dreams.  The QB and his devotion, not only to the sport but to his ailing mother.  The running back who lives under the shadow of a former famous father (played BRILLIANTLY by Tim McGraw) who is now quite the drunk and abusive to boot.  And then there's Booby Miles...the star of the team, but with a hurt knee he because a loose link in the chain.  You can really see how these kids rely on each other to pull through.  The scene where they are all crying on each other in the locker room is especially touching.  What stood out to me was the end, the 'where they are now' type part and you see that only one member of the team is doing anything football related now...it shows that these kids are just normal kids, and now they are normal men, but it was the dream that was so real it made them almost superhuman.  This is a great film to watch over and over with brillant acting by most of the cast.  Billy Bob Thorton is fine, but outshined by Derek Luke (brilliant kid) and Tim McGraw (I was floored...but he STOLE every scene he was in) as well as Lucas Black, a relative newcomer who played the QB and real heart of the team.  Wonderful movie that will tug at the heartstrings and by the end will make you feel proud to be a Texan...err...well, you fill in the blank _______________.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>The best thing about "Friday Night Lights" is how it exposes the small town obsession with high school football.  In Odessa, Texas, where the story is set, businesses shut down and radio sports commentators opine with the pretentious air of political pundits when the Permian Panthers take to the field.  Now this is some serious football country, as the mood of the town fluctuates with the win/loss record of the team and family dynamics follow along with the ebb and flow of the season.  It may be that somebody down there in Odessa just seriously needs to get a life.<br /><br />Based on the book by H.G. Bissinger, the film recounts the 1988 season when Coach Gary Gaines, despite the loss of his best player, still managed to carry his team to the state championships.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the storyline and characters in the film are not always as interesting as the setting and milieu.  The drama is occasionally lacking and many of the characters rank as little more than hoary sports movie cliches: the supportive coach's wife; the abusive, alcoholic father trying to relive his high school glory days through his son; the cocky star player humbled by the exigencies of a cruel fate.  Yet, the film has assets that help it to overcome some of the weaknesses of the script.  Billy Bob Thornton plays Gaines as a thoughtful, even-tempered individual who knows what it takes to win but understands that life does not begin and end on the football field.  His inspirational locker room speech towards the close is restrained, pointed and well delivered.  In fact, the coach seems far less obsessed with winning than many of the ordinary folks he runs into - and has to take unsolicited advice from - on a daily basis.  It is that pressure to win at all costs - placed not only on the boys but on the coach as well - that the movie dramatizes so effectively.  The film also makes it clear that, for many of these boys, football is the only ticket they will ever have out of small town America.<br /><br />"Friday Night Lights" isn't nearly as compelling and involving as "Remember the Titans," but diehard football fans won't be complaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Friday Night Lights" is based on the acclaimed book "Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream" by H.G. Bissinger, who happens to be director Peter Berg's cousin. In 1988, Bissinger followed the Permian Panthers, a high school football team and pride of the West Texas town of Odessa, through a tough season on and off the field. The citizens of Odessa hang their hopes and identity on their football team. Many men of the older generations wear State Championship rings that symbolize their lives' greatest accomplishment. The young Panthers are treated as celebrities. And they are expected to win. "Friday Night Lights" focuses on three young men: The reserved, anxious quarterback, Mike Winchell (Lucas Black), who must lead the team through tough times and take care of his needy mother. Cocky "Boobie" Miles (Derek Luke), the team's star running back and NFL hopeful. And Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund), a  running back with fumbling problems, whose alcoholic father (Tim McGraw), a former player himself, berates him for every small failure. The coach who is expected in no uncertain terms to lead the team to the State Championship was Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton), a man who is reserved off the field, intense on it, and whose every decision is scrutinized by townspeople fixated on their team.<br /><br />"Friday Night Lights" will be remembered as one of the great sports movies. For football fans, it's a joy to watch. The Permian Panther's remarkable 1988 season exemplifies the excitement, the commitment, the pain, the thrills, and the anguish that make sports a universal attraction, if not an obsession. Emotionally captivating portrayals of the players suck the audience in. Billy Bob Thornton does a fantastic job of communicating consistently complex emotions in a man who speaks very little. The film's final game is one of the most riveting I've seen in a movie. According to director Peter Berg, 95% of the film was shot handheld, but the camera does not shake inappropriately. The candid depiction of characters at a significant time in their lives, the relationship of the town to the team, and the nail-biting suspense brought on by possibility of great success or equally great failure makes "Friday Night Lights" a wonderfully entertaining story with near-universal appeal. A truly terrific sports movie -not only for sports fans.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include 4 featurettes, an audio commentary, deleted scenes, text bios of the cast and filmmakers, and a DVD-ROM (Windows only). "Peter Berg Discusses a Scene in the Movie" is a short intro to the scene in the burger joint, which was filmed at the recommendation of the studio who wisely felt that Berg needed something to slow down the frenetic first half-hour of the film. The intro is followed by the scene. "Player Cam" (4 minutes) is a home movie of the actors goofing off. In "Tim McGraw: Off the Stage" (6 minutes), McGraw, director Peter Berg, and producer Brian Grazier talk about the country music star's role as Don's father, Charlie Billingsley. "The Story of the 1988 Permian Panthers" (23 minutes) is a documentary  in which the real Boobie Miles, Don Billingsley, Mike Winchell, and Brian Chavez talk about their experiences as Panthers in 1988. Director Peter Berg and writer H.G. Bissinger also discuss the characters. The audio commentary by director Peter Berg and H.G. Bissinger addresses technical aspects of filming, the story behind the movie, and the characters. Bissinger recalls being there and witnessing the events in 1988, and he tells us which scenes are fiction created for dramatic purposes. Subtitles for the film are available in Spanish and French. Captioning is available in English. Dubbing is available in Spanish and French.</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>The most immediate comparison for this film has to be the sports classic "Hoosiers."  As with that film, "Friday Night Lights" pits the littles guys against the seemingly undefeatable juggernaut.  The players persevere through personal problems, fanatical community pressures, and come together with courage in their collective hearts.  While there are a few predictable moments most of the film somehow remains fresh throughout regardless of the fact that this type of film has all been done before.  By the end of the film I really didn't know if they were going to win the State Championship or not.  The result was up in the air, the suspense and tension in the film at its peak, which made for a much more satisfying experience.  If there is one glaring negative about the film it is all the hand-held cinematography.  I swear I saw the same type of shot about twenty times: a hand-held camera pans side-to-side, catches an image, then rapidly zooms in for a close-up.  It really didn't matter what was in the center of the picture, either.  At one point it is a large bus carrying the student atheletes, another is an exhausted player covered in sweat, etc.  It was done too often to remain kinetic.  I know the director wanted the audience to feel like they were there when it all transpired, but at some point hand-held photography becomes plain annoying.  However, this only takes a little away from the overall effect of this solid, often nostalgic sports film.  I highly recommend this film for anyone who enjoyed playing High School Football.  For the rest of us, it is an otherwise entertaining romp into the world of Texas Football.  I lived in Texas for six years and the fans down there really do love their Football.  Later.</p></br><a href="../users/AESY8NCX6VS6O.html">AESY8NCX6VS6O</a><br/><p>Billy Bob Thorton is an actor that creates a rare psychological effect in the movies he makes. In his best roles (1998's A Simple Plan, 2001's Monster's Ball, this movie) he is so understated and so quietly graceful that the movie goes on around him and the awareness that a great actor is before us disappears. In Friday Night Lights, Thorton occupies such a low-key wavelength that I'm still wondering why he got that starring credit. It's a testament to the pitch-perfect casting of the film, and the wonderful young actors who play the roles, that any supporting player could have had his name in bold on the poster and it would have made sense.<br /><br />  In Lights, Thorton is coach Gary Gaines, the mastermind behind the football juggernaut in Odessa Texas: the Permian Panthers. Gaines is at the head of a team with state championships under its belt, a gigantic reputation in its desolated surroundings, and a football stadium that dwarfs everything within miles of it. This is not Gaines' movie, though; Lights wisely focuses in on the young men who make up the team and the way their lives shape what goes into the game. The best performance of the movie belongs to quarterback Mike Winchell (Lucas Black), whose precise Texas drawl and shy personality make for a fascinating contrast with the louder guys on the team. Speaking of louder guys: there's Derek Luke of Antwone Fisher who plays Boobie Miles, the superstar of the team who gets a little life lesson of his own once the season begins.<br /><br />  It's actual history, the fall of 1988, but David Aaron Cohen's adaptation of the book by H.G. Bissinger brings the inhabitants of the team and the town alive so that a real narrative progresses before your eyes. But the central idea behind Lights that you might have before seeing it is misleading: this is not a movie about a triumphant football team who starts a losing streak and has it all come down to a defining moment at state championships. Lights is a bittersweet tale of the disappointment, uncertainty, and occasional bleakness that accompanies a life totally consumed by a sport. The movie doesn't turn a head away from the fact that, yeah, some football players can't read really well (a particularly triumphant moment in my own mind :) ), they often go on to drive trucks and sell insurance instead of playing pro ball, and sometimes things are such a damn letdown you can't do anything but yank off your helmet and crash into a ball of heaving sobs.<br /><br />  Friday Night Lights has moments of searing brilliance, propelled forward with an atmospheric musical score, but in the end it fails to make that final leap into greatness that it could have. I can't help but admire this film, though, for its bravery in the story that it has to tell. This is not the uplifting sports movie that will run over and over again on TBS a few years from now. This is a 'sports movie' that I thought about for quite a while after leaving the theater. With football, it seems it's all about winning; what Friday Night Lights makes us realize is that there's often more loss, in the very deepest sense of the word. B+</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>"Friday Night Lights" is the true story of the 1988 Odessa-Permian high school football team and their quest for the state championship.  They are one of the best teams in West Texas, and Friday nights are for high school football.  Everything in town stops so that all can go to the game.  Tremendous pressure is put on the kids and the coaches to win.  The star of the team is James "Boobie" Miles (Luke), a cocky kid who definately believes all the hype about him until a early season knee injury turns his world on end.  Stepping up to fill the void are quarterback Mike Winchell (Black) and running backs Don Billingsley (Hedlund) and Chris Comer (Young).  But will they have what it takes to fill that void?  Coach Gary Gaines (Thornton) thinks so, and as the season moves on, he finds himself receiving both the love and the hatred of the town depending on whether they are winning or losing.<br /><br />There is a lot going on in this movie, both on and off the field, and the story flows smoothly back and forth.  After all, everything going on off the field is still football related, and plays into the story quite prominently.  Running through it all is the immense pressure to win.  This is not your typical sports movie, and the final game drives home the point of the whole movie.  This is a very good movie, with solid performances all around, expecially by the mostly unknow actors playing the kids.  This movie is for anyone who has ever been involved in the phenomenon of high school football.  For those people, it will strike a real chord.  For everyone else, it will still be an enjoyable, emotional experience that should not be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>Friday Night Lights is being billed as the best sports movie ever made.  That's a hard title to live up to.  The problem with sports films is that they - almost by necessity - follow the same arc; the tough coach who nobody supports comes in to a small-town team and leads them to the state finals.  Could be the plot of Hoosiers, right?<br /><br />What sets this film apart is that is based on true events.  Far from romanticizing the game, this movie makes the life of a high school football star seem like a nightmare.  It is too much of a responsibility to place on the shoulders of a 17-year-old to give meaning to an entire population's existence.  The director, Peter Berg, is an actor who is distinguishing himself with films like this and The Rundown.  He shows tremendous visual flare.  The movie has a documentary feel.  One of the great devices he uses is to have the constant talk radio chatter in the background; we know that the town's citizens feel that the problem with the local high school is that they "care too much about learnin'".<br /><br />I have never read the book, but I am told that the film is an accurate representation.  I am given to understand that they both capture what it is like for a small town sports star.  Even though it is hard to come up with new twists in sports movies, it does manage a few surprises.  It makes a fascinating and enjoyable movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>On Friday night the only thing that happens in many small towns throughout America is high school football.  During the game the intense lights of parental desire for high achievement on the football field are pushed to a maximum through cheers and standing ovations on great plays by the athletes.  This pressure is a build up of parental and booster club demands on the coaches and the players with demands to win the Friday night game - every Friday night game.<br /><br />H. G. Bissinger decided to capture the atmosphere around the Friday night high school football games as he traveled to Odessa, Texas, in 1988.  This can be read in Bissinger's bestseller Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream, which is the foundation for the film.  In Odessa football is the most important issue of the town during the fall when the lights of Ratliff Stadium are lit.  All businesses close for the game as every single living soul congregates at the stadium to support the towns pride, the Permian Panther's.  However, the game is so much more than just a game, it becomes an outlet for parents and town folks.  The Permian High School athletes have to face these demands of parents, booster clubs, coaches, and the people of the town in what seems to be a struggle for life in a game of football.  The game seems to be the only way out of the town for the young high school students as football is encouraged above education.  The people of Odessa frantically try to achieve this opportunity for the players.  Thus, the goal is always to win the State Championship game.<br /><br />The journey to the State Championship becomes a long and hard trial of emotional and physical stamina on the young high school players as on and off field behavior is being scrutinized in regards to football.  The story focuses on a small number of players that become the mirror image of the whole team.  A couple of these players are James "Boobie" Miles (Derek Luke), Mike Winchell (Lucas Black), and Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund).  Boobie is a rare talent in football, but football is also the only thing that he knows, while the quarterback, Mike, has a sick mother that frequently requires his attention.  These boys on the football team are pushed into an environment where they are turned into men as it is their last year of high school.<br /><br />The director Peter Berg portrays Bissinger's written account through a cinematic experience that is depicted with grainy realism that does not hide the ugliness or the heroic effort by the high school athletes as they try to meet the demands of Odessa.  Berg brings the audience into the locker room where the viewer can visually smell the sweat, feel the emotions, and suffer the pain of each tackle. There is no mystique to what happens in the film and it is this visual frankness that punches the air out the gut of the audience.  Lastly, Berg does not display deep intricate character development, but focuses on the social dilemma of all the characters and the environment in which the story takes place.  In the end, Berg offers the audience a great cinematic experience that requires reflection as this coming of age sports film deals with several issues that are smacked into the viewers face.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q13PHEXGR48Q.html">A2Q13PHEXGR48Q</a><br/><p>Based on a true story, Friday Night Lights is a great sports movie about small town football.  In Odessa, Texas, the Permian Panthers, the high school football team, reign supreme over the town.  Players are treated like celebrities, and every Friday night is like the Super Bowl for the citizens of Odessa.  Because this is the only team they have, Odessa places incredible pressure on the Panthers to win the State Football Championship.  Things are no different in the 1988 season as Coach Gary Gaines hopes to lead the Panthers to victory.  When the team's star running back goes down with a serious knee injury, it looks like their season is in trouble.  This movie, directed by Peter Berg, shows very accurately just how important the football team is to Odessa.  Incredible amounts of pressure are placed on Coach Gaines and his players to win.  A season that does not end in a State Championship is a failure.  Highly recommended sports movie.<br /><br />  Billy Bob Thornton is excellent as Coach Gary Gaines, who must lead his Panthers to the State Championships or else.  This has been quite a year for Thornton who also gave great performances in The Alamo and Bad Santa.  The movie focuses on six players on the team who all give very good, believable performances; Lucas Black as quarterback Mike Winchell, who wants to get out of Odessa but at the same time must support his mother, Garret Hedlund as fullback Don Billingsley, who must live under the watchful eye of his alcoholic father, Derek Luke as tailback James "Boobie" Miles, the cocky, extremely gifted star of the team, Jay Hernandez as free safety Brian Chavez, the gifted student, Lee Jackson as the strong, silent defensive lineman Ivory Christian, and Lee Thompson Young as Chris Comer, the small third string running back.  Tim McGraw is almost unrecognizable in his excellent performance as Charles Billingsley, Don's alcoholic father.  The movie also stars Connie Britton, Grover Coulson, and Connie Cooper.  For a great high school football movie with an excellent cast and a great story based on the 1988 season of the Odessa-Permian Panthers, check out Friday Night Lights!</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Universal / Region Free<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50 / AACS / High Profile 4.1<br />Running time: 1:57:39<br />Movie size: 38,83 GB<br />Disc size: 45,15 GB<br />Total bit rate: 44.01 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 35.86 Mbps<br /><br />DTS-HD Master Audio  English  3986 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 3986 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 24-bit)<br />DTS Audio  French  768 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 768 kbps / 24-bit<br />DTS Audio  Spanish  768 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 768 kbps / 24-bit<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps / Dolby Surround<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH, French, Spanish<br />Number of chapters: 32<br /><br />#Audio Commentary<br />#Deleted Scenes (SD - 22 minutes)<br />#Featurettes<br />--Peter Berg Discusses a Scene in the Movie (SD - 1 minute)<br />--Player Cam (SD - 4 minutes)<br />--Tim McGraw: Off the Stage (SD - 6 minutes)<br />--The Story of the 1988 Permian Panthers (SD - 23 minutes)<br />--Behind the Lights (SD - 26 minutes)<br />--Gridiron Grads (SD - 14 minutes)<br />#BD-Live enabled</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>For an appreciation of this excellent film see the beautifully written review by D. Mikels.  What I want to do here is present a counterpoint.  I played high school football too and might have sat on the bench a little less except that I was a slow-footed T-quarterback at a school that ran the single wing.  Yes, it was that long ago.<br /><br />The football presented in this film by director Peter Berg is a little different.  In fact it is a whole lot different.  Here high school football is the most important thing in the world, not just for the players and coaches, but for the entire town.  If you drive through a west Texas town or an Oklahoma or even an Indiana town on a Friday night in the fall, the town will be deserted (as in the movie) while the stadium at the high school will be lit up like a gigantic Christian revival meeting in which it might be fully expected that Christ will appear to perform the Second Coming.<br /><br />It is no exaggeration to say that in the heartland of America the rites and  rituals of football, joined into by almost the entire populous, take on all the trappings of a most zealous and evangelical religion.  What Peter Berg has done here is capture that maniacal devotion and idolatry--that oh, so American way of life in a quasi-realistic way.<br /><br />I say "quasi" because there is some license taken with reality by the film makers.  First of all, and most importantly, the players are too old.  Derek Luke, who plays star running back Boobie Miles (and does an outstanding job), was 29 when the movie was filmed.  Jay Hernandez who played Chavez was 25.  Anybody who really plays football or coaches it can tell you there is a world of difference between a young man of seventeen or eighteen and one of twenty-five or thirty.<br /><br />And the scenes filmed especially for the movie with the flying tackles and the rolling flips and the bone-crunching open field tackles--forget it.  Those are staged tackles, like kung fu fights in Chinese movies.  Everything looks fantastic only it's about as realistic as a barroom fight in an old cowboy movie from the forties.<br /><br />What is realistic?  When sexy, saucy blonde Melissa goes looking for her trophy seduction of the MoJo quarterback--that's real.  She knows that the highest status in town belongs to the star of the high school football team, and the highest status of any girl is to get that guy.  Also realistic is the pressure put on coaches and administrators to win football games.  Winning isn't a matter of life and death.  As some coaches will tell you, it's more important than that.  And they mean it.  Die and you're only dead.  But lose at football and you are disgraced for life.  Typifying this mentality is Don Billingsley, father of running back Charles, who wants to beat the life out of his son for fumbling the football.  Can't the kid see that you let down your teammates, your school, your town, your friends, your relatives and God Almighty if you fumble the f-ing football?<br /><br />Also real is Boobie Miles's answer to what subject he gets all A's in: "There's only one subject.  That's football."  Or this line from a disappointed fan calling in to the local radio jock show after the team loses a game: "There's too much learning going on at that school."  He's not kidding.  He means it.  Too much time in the classroom.  Too little on the field.<br /><br />So is this film--as its devoted fans believe and know to be true--an ode to the glory and beauty of football?  Think again, jockstrap.  It's a glorification.  It represents a mentality in which the greatest events of life occur when you're eighteen years old.  After that it's all over.  What you got left is beer, the wife, TV, and Bruce Springsteen's "Glory Days."  Or to choose another lyric, what you've got are "Veterans of the fight/Fast asleep at the traffic light."  (Jackson Browne)<br /><br />There are a number of goofs and anachronisms in the movie.  IMDb lists a dozen or so including cars in the parking lots that weren't even made in 1988, the year of the film, and football gear used that didn't exist then.  But that doesn't matter, and nobody who loves this film cares in the slightest about that because what really counts is the fantasy, the imagined and recalled glory of a time when everything was new and astonishingly vivid, when events made indelible marks on our hearts and souls. When we were all 17.  This then is mythology in the making and in the living.<br /><br />The question begs itself: is this good or is this bad?  Is football as a religion something to be treasured or condemned?  Personally I have mixed feelings.  Young men have aggressive tendencies that need to be channeled and middle-aged men need to play war games.  Football allows an acting out of these needs without undue harm to anyone.  Certainly football is better than gang-banging.<br /><br />When, some many years down the road, the history of cinema is brought up to date, this film will be remembered because it is a very good film, and Billy Bob Thornton's fine performance as Coach Gary Grimes will be appreciated.  But instead of the film being seen as a realistic portrayal of what it's like to play and be involved in high school football, it will be seen as a commentary on the sociology of middle America in the late 20th century, a time when the nation was very rich and football was not only king but something close to a way of life, something indistinguishable from a national religion.</p></br><a href="../users/AKS9SJTHTU0OM.html">AKS9SJTHTU0OM</a><br/><p>Almost everything works in this portrait of the madness for and around<br />high-school football in a small Texas town.<br /><br />One of the best sports movies I've seen, largely because it's not really about<br />the sport, or the big game, or winning and losing.  It's about growing up, letting<br />go of dreams, the pressure adults put on kids to fulfill their own dreams, losing<br />perspective and gaining it.  It seems to try and honestly look at both sides of high<br />school football; how it helps young men grow, challenge themselves and bond,<br />but at the same time how it subjects them to physical harm, an unrealistic set of<br />expectations about life after being a local star, and being forced to carry a whole<br />town on your shoulders when you're only 17.<br /><br />Some terrific visuals, both in the quick cutting ferocity of the games, and in the<br />long aerial views of the empty Texas plains.<br /><br />It does cheat in a few moments, trying to have it's cake and eat it too - a few plot<br />lines are resolved a touch too easily or neatly, a few plot twists feel too familiar<br />from other films.  And I understand those that say the film displays a superior<br />attitude towards these small town people.  But I found those weaker moments<br />fleeting in a film that surprised me with the strength of it's acting, writing, and filmmaking.</p></br></body></html>

The film finds recent media-pimped heart-throb, Shia LaBeouf, who spends most of the film resembling nothing less than a startled vole with a perspiration problem, framed for conspiracy to commit terrorism and aided in his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305428115">Enemy of the State</a> style flight from the authorities by an unseen female voice with seemingly god-like abilities to manipulate technology. Now, if you like me, are capable of adding two and two together, you'll have worked exactly who this mysterious puppet-master is in about one minute flat. Further to that, both the other half and I had worked out the entire plot within about five minutes, but then we watch a lot of these kinds of films. As with the recent Liam Neeson opus, 'Taken', it's a mish-mash of cinematic clich&eacute;s which have been dusted off, given a fresh lick of paint and elevated to the status of "extremely watchable" by hyper-kinetic execution. The vortex of conspiracy which sweeps a cast including LaBeouf, Michelle Monaghan, Billy Bob Thornton (who gets all the best lines), Rosario Dawson and Michael Chiklis into a maelstrom of car chases, explosions and fist fights is completely unbelievable, but then that's never been a strike against a film in my opinion. Hell, I watch films for escapism and this is escapism - with a vaguely defined message about the dangerously fragile nature of liberty that gets lost along the way - pure and simple. I say rent and watch with the lights out, the sound way up and a big bucket of popcorn. It's why films like this exist and this film is largely superior to any other recent efforts in this genre. Not great, but a good, solid couple of hours of mindless entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/AJLYAY1G5Z8GE.html">AJLYAY1G5Z8GE</a><br/><p>Original and entertaining. This movie tells you that we should not give computers more artificial intelligence that will make them eventually independent and make decisions on their own, or else they might try controlling our lives. The story is a little similar to the matrix in that aspect.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about this movie is the way Eagle Eye was destroyed. It was too easy.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>The film Eagle Eye advertised itself as an action/adventure film with an aspect of goverment intruige ("Big Brother is watching").  While the film definately delivers in the action department, there really isn't much else to it.<br /><br />The basic plot of the film centers on two ordinary people who are suddenly "activated" as terrorists and must flee for there lives while only taking mesages from all the electronic devices around them (cell phones, billboards, streaming text lines, LED signs, etc.).  As they continue to flee, they eventually figure out what is happening to them and begin hatching a plan to stop it.<br /><br />The reason why this movie fails, though, is that is doesn't focuses on the dramatic elements that are actually interesting.  Without giving any spoilers, the film would have been much better served focusing on two areas: 1. The technology behind why the two U.S. citizens are "activated" in the first place; and 2. The relationship between the two lead characters played by Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan.<br /><br />Instead, however, this film is little more than one pulse-pounding action sequence after another with just enough (but much too little) exposition to move the plot forward to the next crazy chase scene.  Plus, the focus of the film seemed to be on the fact that the two citizens can be communicated with or found by any electronic device.  However, it covered much of the same territory that Will Smith and Gene Hackman did in Enemy of the State a decade ago.  There wasn't enough new material to really hook me into this plot thread.<br /><br />Thus, if you a huge fan of non-stop action in films, you will love this film.  If you need some character and plot development to keep your interest, though, then skip this movie, as you will just be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>Back in the late 90's, well-known producer/director Steven Spielberg had an idea of a story about the government using technology as a way to watch people.  An idea that is based on Isaac Asimov's short story "All the Troubles of the World".  With the discussion of how far the government can go in profiling and surveillance will always be debatable but this film does have its relevance with today's news and thus Spielberg's idea from the mid-to-late 90's became a reality in 2008 with the release of "EAGLE EYE".<br /><br />The film is directed by D.J. Caruso ("Disturbia") who was inspired by Robert Lantham's "War Games" when creating "EAGLE EYE".  The film ended up grossing over $177 million worldwide and had a budget of $80 million.  The film reunites Shia LaBeouf with Steven Spielberg (who produced "Transformers" and "Indiana Jones: The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull") and Caruso (for "Disturbia") and stars the following talent Michelle Monaghan ("Mission Impossible III", "The Heartbreak Kid", "Bourne Supremacy"), Billy Bob Thornton ("Monster's Ball", "The Alamo", "Mr. Woodcock"), Rosario Dawson ("Sin City", "Seven Pounds", "Clerks II") and Michael Chiklis ("Fantastic Four","The Shield", "The Commish").<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"EAGLE EYE" definitely showcases awesome picture quality and I wouldn't expect anything lower from a Steven Spielberg produced film.  The film featured in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of 2:35:1 features an enormous amount of action that in both daylight, night, lowlight conditions with no signs of artifacts.  Blacks are really nice and deep and I recall no artifacting or low-light noise.<br /><br />The outdoor scenes are absolutely beautiful but despite overcast but the amount of detail and the number of locations featured in the film definitely is a major plus.  You really get something new with each shot.  Overall, a beautiful transfer that I can't complain about.  There are a lot of colors in the film and almost an artistic way of utilizing colors courtesy of Director of Photography Dariusz Wolski is known for his work on the "Pirates of the Caribbean" films and "Sweeney Todd" but his experience really gave "EAGLE EYE" a visceral explosion with the amount of colors combined with the action and of course, the audio.<br /><br />"EAGLE EYE" is featured in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and this lossless track is just pleasing to listen to.  Of course, having watched the car chase scene and hearing how beautiful that film sounds and now watching "EAGLE EYE", "QoS" definitely haves the one up on "EAGLE EYE" in the sound department but that is not bad by all means.  The amount of audio from the various chase scenes to the explosions definitely give your home theater setup a workout.<br /><br />Overall, there's not much to complain about the video and audio quality, both are well done!<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"EAGLE EYE" contains the following special features (many of them in HD):<br /><br />  * Deleted Scenes - (4:39) A total of three deleted scenes featured below and an alternate ending.  The alternate ending was a bit farfetched as Jerry buys Sam "Rock Band" for a birthday gift and the kids start playing and performing the songs and we learn that Ariia has managed to get herself into a video game.  I'm glad they didn't use that alternate ending.<br /><br />* Ethan's Wake HD<br />* Minuteman HD<br />* Twins HD<br />* Alternate Ending HD<br /><br />  * Asymmetric Warfare: The Making of Eagle Eye - (25:32) A featurette with interviews with the producers, director, crew, cast and behind-the-scene footage of the making of the film.  How Steven Spielberg brought in D.J. Caruso to direct and how Caruso was reunited with LaBoeouf (both worked together on "Disturbia") and also working with the other talent such as Billy Bob Thornton, Michelle Monaghan and Rosario Dawson.  How Caruso was influenced by "Wargames" director.<br />  * Eagle Eye on Location: Washington, D.C. - (5:58) A featurette about shooting the film in Washington D.C., shooting the film at the Library of Congress, the Pentagon and working with actual soldiers from the military.<br />  * Is My Cell Phone Spying on Me? - (9:13) How the government can be spying on people with the use of cell phones.  Interviews with the producer, director, the talents including Michal Zimmer (Asst. Professor in the School of Information Studies, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee) and Marc Rotenberg (Exec. Director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center).<br />  * Shall We Play A Game? HD - (9:21) A conversation between "Eagle Eye" Director D.J. Caruso and his mentor John Badham, Director of "War Games".  A very fun conversation to watch as we learn about both films and the differences of technology of the present and the past.<br />  * Road Trip - (3:05) A featurette about the many locations that "Eagle Eye" was filmed.  The crew and talent all experienced a major road trip of filming in these many locations.<br />  * Gag Reel - (6:57) A fun, lengthy gag reel of the crew and talent having fun or scenes of them messing up their lines.<br />  * Photo Gallery - Using your remote, you can navigate through still images taken from the film.<br />  * Theatrical Trailer - (2:20) The original theatrical trailer.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />"EAGLE EYE" was a film that definitely made me curious because the trailer had this hi-tech fugitive type of vibe going for it.<br /><br />But I have to admit that the film felt like it was full of non-stop action, many chase scenes and if anything, not much plot.  Where Caruso credits John Badham ("War Games") as his mentor, where a film like "War Games" is effective is that although there are chase scenes, there is quite a bit of character development and an actual plot.<br /><br />Immediately in "EAGLE EYE", we are to believe that the government has given so much power to a supercomputer that in "Terminator" like fashion, it rebels, it kills and it feels slighted because the President of the United States went against its recommendation.  The last time I saw a supercomputer get so emotional was 1997's "Universal Soldier: The Return".<br /><br />But of course the message being driven was how everything is now being connected through technology and that our privacy is now under the watchful eye of the government.<br /><br />But when there is potential for plot, Caruso goes Michael Bay and wants to focus on the action-scenes and granted, there are a good number of people who love that.  Jean Claude Van Damme or Steven Segal films anyone?<br /><br />The characters brought into the mix such as Michelle Monaghan as Rachel.  Every role she has portrayed, we have cared about her...but in this film, because of its chaotic pacing, there's no time to really give a damn.  Michael Chiklis was not utilized as much as I hoped.<br /><br />And for Billy Bob Thornton and Rosario Dawson, do these two agents really need to squabble so much that their efforts are being tested by this supercomputer?  I did enjoy Thornton and Dawson's characters but I felt they were not used effectively.  Especially Anthony Mackie as Major William Bowman who becomes a hero as he defies the antagonist and you ended up rooting for the guy but he ends up being under utilized and I expected to see him one last time at the end of the film.<br /><br />And last, Julianne Moore did do a great job supplying the voice of supercomputer Ariia.<br /><br />But with the overall plot of a supercomputer that has gone on a revenge tirade...to say the least, "EAGLE EYE" is not a film about logic.<br /><br />What could have been an intellectual thriller, ends up being a film with a lot of destruction, explosions and two main characters who have no idea what they are doing but realize that they could be killed by electronic wires or some form of technology.  OK... ...even in the middle of the country where there are no signs of technology but electrical wires, this antagonist has the ability to control even that and electrocute them.<br /><br />So, whether "EAGLE EYE" is trying to poke fun about the Patriot Act or being a film that wants people to consider the privacy issues going on today in the world, "EAGLE EYE" had potential but somehow the action scenes over dominates the film.  With what plot does happen, it just seems farfetched.<br /><br />Did I dislike the film or the Blu-ray.  Actually, no I didn't.  I was entertained by the action scenes and when you know that logic can be thrown out the door, you just enjoy the film for what it is and hope that the screenplay gets even more creative or exciting.<br /><br />On the Blu-ray end, the action scenes look great and the audio quality is magnificent but along with great picture quality and great audio quality, you would hope to get a great story behind that.  I did enjoy the special features especially the interview between "EAGLE EYE" Director Caruso and "War Games" Director John Badham was quite interesting.  Especially when Caruso throws in "Saturday Night Fever" (which Badham also directed) as another film of inspiration.  But where Caruso missed the boat is that with "War Games", you cared about the characters.  There was a good amount of character development... But with "EAGLE EYE", action is put as priority over storytelling.<br /><br />Overall, "EAGLE EYE" was an entertaining thriller.  I was not bored nor did I want to shut the film off.  There are really cool action sequences in the film and that is the strong point of the film.<br /><br />The Blu-ray does feature great picture and audio quality and several special features to keep one busy.  But overall, I can't help but feel that the potential for something greater was missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB.html">A3M6RVUVZOQZLB</a><br/><p>The U. S. Government now has a super computer capable of accessing every electronic device ever invented and can conduct even through liquid when push comes to shove. Its super duper computer spy network is called "Eagle Eye," and it means something more powerful than Big Brother is watching. It is a she and she is wired/programed/processed/evolved to go beyond the confines of her gold globes and her 36 floors underground below the Pentagon.<br /><br />Early on, Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBoeuf) is forced to follow Eagle Eye's orders, as is Michelle Monagham's character. The early chase scene in which they are involved put me on my feet from wildly choreographed car collisions, and the whirligig cranes were beyond believable, creating pure adrenaline rushes.<br /><br />All the impossible machinations controlled by Eagle Eye are just too incredible to be vaguely believable. On the other hand, remember Hal? "2001: Space Odyssey" was uniquely far-fetched, too. A computer that would kill all the astronauts but one and take control of the spacecraft? We accepted that premise, didn't we? It's not much different with Eagle Eye, except her power is inordinately more powerful.<br /><br />As for the ending that meets with disagreement in some of these reviews, my question is: Why not that ending? What we thought was the ending is not in keeping with the powerhouse story. It would be anti-climatic.<br /><br />Special kudos go to Rosario Dawson and Michael Chiklis, both of whom lend credence to the story. As for Billy Bob Thornton, his pancake makeup was so thick as to be the most laughable part of the story! A high-ranking FBI agent wearing all that makeup! Now that's unbelievable!<br /><br />If you are looking for a message, consider the potentially dangerous power of a super computer gone rogue. Do we even know if the government has a super computer?<br /><br />Even if you can't concede Eagle Eye's all-pervasive powers, just grumble over the premise, then relax, and enjoy the non-stop action. Actually, there is no relaxing in this film. Buckle in and get ready for non-stop thrills.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>The film Eagle Eye advertised itself as an action/adventure film with an aspect of goverment intruige ("Big Brother is watching").

His twin has been murdered and he is forced to do things that he doesn't want to do (by a gentle, female voice on the phone), all with the help of an unwilling, single mother played by Michelle Monaghan. Torn between fear and duty to Country, LaBeouf  and Monaghan, follow a series of steps to unmask who is behind the plots and why. Rosario Dawson and Billy Bob Thornton are wonderful in their support roles as law enforcement officers, who soon begin to believe that everything is not as it seems.<br /><br />While I found the movie entertaining (chase scenes especially) and somewhat exciting, I don't think there was anything too original. This plot, the "Big Brother/Artificial Intelligence" gone mad concept, has been done several times before (Stealth, I-Robot, Terminator, Minority Report, Transformers, etc), and this one really didn't have anything new. Although the computer supposedly gained "intelligence" or at least began making decisions based on what "it" thought was best for the country, there still should have been more of a fail safe on the system in place. Now don't get me wrong, I am personally intrigued by artificial intelligence (in movies usually something that we mere humans have created) that "realizes itself" and attempts to erase mankind for the betterment of all. Terminator, for example, was the perfect balance between "artificial intelligence and realization" because they looked human but feel that the world would be a better place without us, while the computer generated female voice felt that our world would be a better place with a different President and Cabinet. I think it was a decent movie, I just wish it had been better.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>EAGLE EYE  is not a great movie but it is an entertaining one.  Granted, leaving reason at the door is a prerequisite to plugging into the plot, but the style of the film and the premise that in the midst of all of our government's supposedly first class intelligence agencies such amazing programs can be staged opens the window for some speculation. Credit writers John Glenn, Travis Wright, Hillary Seitz and Dan McDermott for pushing the button on current cellphone obsession tied to terrorism to an all time high. And with director D.J. Caruso at the helm the whole preposterous (but entertaining) tale comes vividly to life.<br /><br />Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBeouf) is a free-living disappointment to his father and at the funeral of Jerry's twin brother Ethan the tables turn.  Somehow Jerry's little apartment is filled with guns and ammo and a mysterious female telephone voice on his cellphone warns him to escape the impending FBI entry.  Jerry is clueless as to the appearance of the weaponry and when taken into custody Agent Thomas Morgan (Billy Bob Thornton) accuses him of collusion with his probable terrorist twin brother, now deceased.  Jerry escapes but is 'followed' by the constant orders from his cellphone that lead to dangerous circumstances.  On the other side of the city a working mother Rachel (Michelle Monaghan) receives equally strange cellphone calls threatening to murder her child if he does not do the voice's bidding.  Obviously Jerry and Rachel are joined in this duo adventure and the manner in which they resolve the clues on the run closely pursued by Agent Morgan, Zoe Perez (Rosario Dawson) et al drives the story to its conclusion.<br /><br />The movie is bogged down with far too many car chases and absurd crashes and disasters, but the idea of terrorism in a new guise is an interesting one.  But for all the tense mood of the movie, the audience is doused with a syrupy sentimental ending which all but negates the adrenalin flow the film had.  LaBeouf and Monaghan make an interesting coupling, given the little dialog they have to create fleshed out characters. Not a great movie, but not a bad movie for thriller fans.

I'm tired of movies that are trying to be smart but wind up proving themselves ten times over to be more preposterous than realistic.<br /><br />There is not one scene in this movie that makes any sense whatsoever.<br /><br />`Eagle Eye' starts with a slacker twin brother mourning over the loss of his brother, his stark opposite.  There is also a single mother who fights to find some time for herself while struggling to get her son's father to do his part.  These two people are going to be thrown into an adventure when a woman (is it a `woman') calls them up and gives them an ultimatum.  For Jerry it's `do as I say or the FED's will think you're a terrorist and arrest you' and for Rachel it's `do as I say or the train your son is on is going to crash'.  So, needless to say, they do as the voice says.<br /><br />It could have been interesting, but it is so mind numbingly ridiculous that it loses all interest points in the first twenty minutes.  The plot is overworked and underdeveloped.  The ending is a ridiculous mess that feels thrown together to make sense out of something that offers no sense to be made.  Some have noted that the films moves at such a fast pace we are not given time to understand how stupid the film is, but sadly that is not true enough.  Sure, there is a lot of stuff going on all the time, but the fact of the matter is that the action is so over the top and half of it feels as though it has been spliced in from bigger and better films.<br /><br />The action is also very, very uninteresting.<br /><br />The acting is a mess.  Shia LaBeouf is just irritating, not charming or likable at all really.  Michelle Monaghan (who is gorgeous yet manages to look like a wreck here) is horrible here, giving her character no development and just one oversized emotion.  Rosario Dawson is unbelievable, Chiklis is underused and Thornton is a clich&eacute;, but he's entertaining at least so I'll credit him that.<br /><br />Each and every passing scene brought with it yet another `that would never happen' moment, and so many of those strung together makes for one very tediously unrealistic movie.  My wife likened it to `Minority Report', in that both films make an enemy out of technology, but the difference between those two films is that one of them fleshed out a coherent and plausible plot and coupled it with engrossing and entertaining action while the other through a bunch of action scenes on an idea and called it a movie.<br /><br />`Minority Report' is a minor sci-fi classic; `Eagle Eye' is a forgettable popcorn muncher.</p></br><a href="../users/A356TJCTCLDN89.html">A356TJCTCLDN89</a><br/><p>Jerry is a loser. Rachel is a single mother. They both get phone calls ordering them to do stuff or Rachel's child is going to die. The lady on the phone has other terrified slaves, a music shop owner, a jewler, a TSA worker, a Chinese tour bus group and an FBI agent. All these people are cogs in a wild plan to fix a political problem. If you saw 2001, watched the Daystrom episode of Star Trek or watched the Terminator then you probably sighed when the big denouncement came up. Parts of the movie are okay and parts are ridiculous. Jerry has to run like a sprinter champion, jump like a diver, pull a gun on professionals and fight a guy who should've been able to break him like a twig. The body count in this movie is so high that there must be hundreds of folks dead or injured in Jerry and Rachel's wake.<br />Eagle Eye is one of those flicks that is best for sitting on the couch eating popcorn and talking back to the screen. Unless you want to own every movie that Billy Bob Thornton has appeared in or if you really, really like looking at Shia then don't bother to buy this.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Hasn't the (Spoiler!) "Super Computer Gone Berserk" plot been hashed, and rehashed, enough?  Even more importantly:  Aren't Shia LaBeouf's 15 minutes officially over?  So, when you combine a leftover plot with LaBeouf's annoying ADD acting you get a wacky turkey like EAGLE EYE.  Is there lots of action?  Yes.  Are many of the special effects impressive?  Most certainly.  But--harkening back to the last presidential campaign--even if you put lipstick on a pig. . .<br /><br />A copier store nobody (LaBeouf) and a single mother (Michelle Monaghan, who's okay) are suddenly selected by Big Brother (only this time, it's Big Sister) to be dupes in the AI's grand (and absurd) scheme to save the nation.  Consequently, the two characters are forced to jump through death defying hoops along the way--all while receiving never-ending cell phone instructions.  They're chased by lots of folks, but primarily by an egotistical FBI agent (Billy Bob Thornton), who doesn't see the light until it's meeting him right between the eyeballs.  (Incidentally, Thornton looks embarrassed playing this role.  He should be.)  The story predictably builds to a climactic howler, then EAGLE EYE does what all bad films do.  It has a sappy, wannabe feel good ending.  And I felt good when I pressed the OFF button on my remote.<br />--D.

Caruso has had his share of flops (Taking Lives, anyone) but with Distrubia he pretty much hit pay dirt and will without a doubt, make movies for years to come. Eagle Eye reminded me of Enemy Of The State in a lot of ways, and being that I'm a consiprasit, I could identify with the film and its paranoia. Shia Labruf (who I'm not tired of yet) turns in another good performance and he easily shows why in the next three to five years he'll be on Hollywood A-list. The nature of the film doesn't require Shia to be a hard-core action star, he's just an everyman put in a situation he doesn't want to be in. Michelle Monaghan does all right in the film but she has yet to equal her performance in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. The rest of the cast from Anthony Mackie & Rosario Dawson to Billy Bob Thornton all walk through their roles with ease. Eagle Eye is nothing more than popcorn escapist entertainment, and I can wait to see Shia in Transformers 2.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SU3TXON36T0X.html">A3SU3TXON36T0X</a><br/><p>_Eagle Eye_ (2008) starring Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monagan is a disturbing film which makes the predictions of 1984 look limp by comparison and offers a very real and imminent possibility.  This film features a super-computer capable of controlling the lives and actions of all the citizens of the United States.  Certain citizens are singled out by the computer for no apparent reason and drafted into the secret war being waged against the United States president for his violation of the Constitution.  What is most eerie about this film, is the way it shows that technology has overtaken society and all actions and thoughts are capable of being monitored.  In the film, both stars are singled out by the computer for various reasons and made to take part in the planned action against the president.  Since technological devices (including cell phones, blackberries, computers, street signs, and overhead projectors) are ubiquitous in any given city it is possible for the computer to access the location of the citizens anywhere and also impossible for them to escape its grip.  Thus, we learn how freedom is imperiled by emerging technologies which already are amongst us capable of controlling our very actions.  As it turns out, the entire computer system has been implemented in an effort to fight terrorism.  However, the costs prove to be enormous as it becomes apparent that in fighting terrorism all freedom has been lost.  This film is certainly quite eerie when one considers the ubiquitous presence of spy technology in our society and the fact that every action is being recorded.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FY3H6F4249E0.html">A3FY3H6F4249E0</a><br/><p>Saw this in the theater. I thought it was excellent! It was fast moving with awesome car chase scenes. I would watch it again in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Picture the ultimate computer, that records data from all electronic devices and stores it. It runs profiles on people everywhere based on that data, to see who might represent a terrorist threat. It monitors cell phones, emails, text messages, computers, street cameras, bank cameras, and anything else while it searches for relevant information. It can access, alter, activate or shut down anything electronic. And if someone calls you on the phone and tells you to do something, you'd better do it! The 2 main characters, Jerry and Rachelle, were thrown together and take off through the story. Great storyline, great acting job.

Happy New Year!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A4UKBG3M5U5TI.html">A4UKBG3M5U5TI</a><br/><p>Shia LeBeouf continues his quest to become the new action star with "Eagle Eye," a movie that reteams him with his "Disturbia" director (D.J. Caruso).  He plays Jerry Shaw, a ne'er do well who works at Copy Cabana.  He's chronically broke and behind on his rent, but he receives a surprise when he uses an ATM - over $700,000 has been deposited into his account.  That's just the beginning, though; when he returns home, he has received numerous deliveries to his small apartment.  As he goes through the boxes, he's shocked that they contain guns and other suspicious items.  That's when he receives the first call from a mysterious female caller; she tells him to flee the scene or else he'll be captured by the FBI.  The rest of the film unfolds with the female caller dictating Jerry's moves and involves a dead twin brother, a sexy mother, and Billy Bob Thornton, among other oddities.<br /><br />"Eagle Eye" is about what you would expect from a mid-level thriller.  There are some very good action scenes, particularly one involving a plane that tails Jerry's car into a tunnel.  LeBeouf is a likeable enough protagonist, and the movie has some nice twists.  There are also some clever scenes involving the female caller seeming to be omniscient and having unbelievable powers to control electronic items.  At the same time, the movie isn't very believable and does require a hefty suspension of disbelief.  It also cribs shamelessly from a number of other movies, including "Enemy of the State" and a dozen Hitchcock flicks.  However, if you want a mindless popcorn thriller, then you'll probably enjoy this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VWYJ86">The Bourne Ultimatum (Widescreen Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009ZYC0">Minority Report (Widescreen Edition)</a> both produced similar moments which I really dug, in which a near omniscient character guides his/her fleeing companion and does so with such exquisite timing and pinpoint accuracy that capture is thereby avoided (Jason Bourne in one film, that psychic chick in the other). EAGLE EYE is one extended version of these two moments, and, guess what, it doesn't get old.<br /><br />I guess this could happen, government voyeurism, what with how advanced technology's gotten. In fact, I've no doubt this is happening right now. EAGLE EYE presents a twisty plot, the soup of which blends Big Brother paranoia, the techno thriller, the shadow of terrorism, a whiff of Skynet, and the classic man on the run theme. EAGLE EYE tells of two strangers - Jerry Shaw, the slacker copy boy (excuse me, "copy associate") from Copy Cabana and Rachel, the stressed single mom/paralegal - suddenly flung together by a mysterious (and dang pushy) female who gives them brisk instructions over their cell phones, forcing them to frenetically run and jump around, drive like they've got to use the bathroom, hold up a pair of security guards for a briefcase (of which contents are a letdown, by the way), and even sneak onboard a military cargo plane. And those are just for starters...<br /><br />The most intriguing part of the film, for me, was learning what was up with the voicy voice, who's cornered Jerry by framing him as a terrorist and cornered Rachel by threatening to kill her son. Much of the suspense leaks out once the film drops the 411 on the cell phone taskmaster. EAGLE EYE is escapist cinema which may have started out intending to make some sort of significant political and social statement but then kind of shrugged it off halfway thru the film. There's no dearth of far-fetched moments (like, on the train, where there just happened to be a conveniently snoozing stranger with a celly sitting right across from Shia or Rachel being so out-of-the-blue capable with a firearm). But the third act really goes ape-shiznit with the preposterous as the Big Bad's plans coalesce and imperil the nation's highest offices. The film's big crescendo echoes the climax scene from Hitchcock's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009351JS">The Man Who Knew Too Much</a>.<br /><br />Will Smith's ENEMY OF THE STATE and the Bourne series have already demonstrated that the government can check up on us by accessing security, surveillance, and traffic cameras, as well as cell phones. EAGLE EYE one-ups these films by featuring an antagonist who is more far reaching, more omnipresent. The voice not only can track any person anytime, anywhere, by tapping into the nation's electronic data grid, but she can remotely control stop lights, steer elevated trains, set off power lines, and even take over military aircrafts. When our heroes go on the run (and don't really have time to chat on the cell), they get helpful directions from various electronic billboard signs, readout displays and monitor screens. So, unless you're Amish, there's no escaping the nagging voice.<br /><br />Shia LaBeouf lost some cred with me for his vine-swinging part in the latest Indiana Jones flick. Here, he's decent but this really isn't a platform to show off his acting chops, slave as the picture is to the quick cut edits, flashy stunts and loud pyrotechnics. LaBeouf's characer has a few moments to do his surly, angst-ridden bit (what with his dead twin brother being the brighter light in the family), but he and lead actress Michelle Monaghan actually come off more as chess pieces being shuffled about by the all powerful entity to progress its murky end game. Julianne Moore plays the mysterious voice on the phone, managing to sound impersonal yet officiously sexy. Billy Bob Thornton is good as the undeterred FBI guy and Rosario Dawson is wasted as Air Force OSI Agent Zoey Perez trying to piece it all together. Thornton, by the way, comes up with the best line in the film, as he chews out his underlings: "If I don't get some good leads soon, you're all gonna be demoted into something that's gonna require touching $#!t with your hands!"<br /><br />So, why am I four-starring this film? Because, in spite of the over-the-top beats, I got hooked into the premise enough that I had to see it thru to the end. And it may be loud and sometimes incoherent, but, damn if I didn't enjoy the wild ride. I think the key is that the film moves at such a frenetic pace that it forces you to shift your focus from one sequence to the next. You might just have enough time to ponder the implausibility of whatever's on the screen, but then you almost immediately get distracted with the next implausible thing on the screen. It's sleight-of-hand trickeration, is what it is. And, in the final tally, I had a good time (and, yes, part of the good time was spent making fun of the film).<br /><br />As for the government accessing our electronic devices, that would certainly explain why I'm so sucky at Tetris on my cell phone. Now I see that it's the government conducting cyber terrorism. Those finks.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EUSH8DPW75LR.html">A3EUSH8DPW75LR</a><br/><p>I must admit most of this review will be based on my second viewing of this film.  Both viewings were on blu ray but the first time I had high expectations.  The story line intrigued me and I am a huge Shia LaBeouf fan.  With the first viewing I didn't like it very much.  I liked Shia but I thought the story line pushed the limits and was just too unbelievable for me.  It looked great in blu ray but I was disappointed.<br /><br />Well, we all know that our experiences when we have expectations can sometimes be altered.  I love blu ray, have consistently read how EAGLE EYE is one of the best films to utilize blu ray to its full effect so now, many months after my first viewing I purchased EAGLE EYE.  I wanted to have it for I do want to own every Shia LaBeouf film and I am so grateful I did.  This time I sat back with my home theater system with no expectations and was on the edge of my seat from beginnig to end.  Knowing the plot and having no expectations allowed me to just view it and amazingly the plot suddendlty made sense, caught me up from beginning to end and I enjoyed myself immensely.<br /><br />Kudos first must go to the acting.  Shia LaBeouf, Michelle Monaghan and Billy Bob Thornton all up the ante with their acting chops.  These characters are believable and it is refreshing to have the male and female lead not get romantically involved.  It brings more of a sense of relity to the film.  This film is directed and acted with respect to the story and it is very believable once you get caught up.  It is also filled with amazing action sequences and they were all right - blu ray is the only real way to enjoy this film to is full effect.  The video presentation is an amazingly crisp 1080p.  Colors and clarity are perfection.  Flesh tones are just right and the quality does not falter be it day or night, inside or outside.  The video never falters throughout the amazing action sequences.  The audio is an amazing Dolby TruHD 5.1.  Whether with dialogue driven scenes or the major action driven scenes the audio is strong, vibrant and realistic.  All the speakers of your theatre system will be put to use and the sound quality throughout is at such a level that it makes the film that much more stimulating.<br /><br />This is the first time I have ever said that if you did not like a film the first time give it a second shot but EAGLE EYE is an action film of the highest caliber with stimulating suspense.  Certainly one I plan on viewing again and again.  Highly recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Eagle Eye was a fun wild ride. It had action, and humor. The acting was especially very good. Shila Lebouf did an extremelly good job.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I know, I know! This film is implausible, it could have had a better actor (Shia LaBeouf) in the lead, but growing up loving the sci-fi genre of yesteryear, I had to think about my rating on those terms. In the old days of sci-fi films(50's, 60's and 70's) we didn't always get the best actors or special FX and the plots were certainly a bit of a stretch to say the least. So if you compare this film to some of those old lovable and laughable classics; this film is really quite interesting and very well done. Sure there are many moments where everything works out too conveniently, but it's a sci-fi fantasy and I can forgive that because it's a well executed story with an intriguing plot.<br /><br />I really liked this film and I think those of you who go into this film with the right frame of mind will truly enjoy it despite its minor shortcomings. Of course this film is considered sci-fi now, but who knows if it's not reality in a few years!</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>The film Eagle Eye advertised itself as an action/adventure film with an aspect of government intrigue ("Big Brother is watching").  While the film definitely delivers in the action department, there really isn't much else to it.<br /><br />The basic plot of the film centers on two ordinary people who are suddenly "activated" as terrorists and must flee for there lives while only taking messages from all the electronic devices around them (cell phones, billboards, streaming text lines, LED signs, etc.).  As they continue to flee, they eventually figure out what is happening to them and begin hatching a plan to stop it.<br /><br />The reason why this movie fails, though, is that is doesn't focuses on the dramatic elements that are actually interesting.  Without giving any spoilers, the film would have been much better served focusing on two areas: 1. The technology behind why the two U.S. citizens are "activated" in the first place; and 2. The relationship between the two lead characters played by Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan.<br /><br />Instead, however, this film is little more than one pulse-pounding action sequence after another with just enough (but much too little) exposition to move the plot forward to the next crazy chase scene.  Plus, the focus of the film seemed to be on the fact that the two citizens can be communicated with or found by any electronic device.  However, it covered much of the same territory that Will Smith and Gene Hackman did in Enemy of the State a decade ago.  There wasn't enough new material to really hook me into this plot thread.<br /><br />Thus, if you a huge fan of non-stop action in films, you will love this film.  If you need some character and plot development to keep your interest, though, then skip this movie, as you will just be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>This is one of those movies that after seeing the previews I just didn't care to watch.  That being said, when this came on cable, out of curiosity I thought I'd watch a few minutes to see if it was going to be as bad as I imagined.  It wasn't.  I watched the whole thing and enjoyed it.<br /><br />Sure, the story is loosely stitched together and barely plausible, but it works well enough to keep the non-stop action moving at breakneck speed. The fast pace of this film left little time to think about how silly and unrealistic the plot was at times.<br /><br />I'd definitely watch this again.</p></br><a href="../users/AK0CENM3LUM28.html">AK0CENM3LUM28</a><br/><p>Eagle Eye / B001L57ZYM<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />"Eagle Eye" isn't likely to win any major awards for a deep, compelling story or emotionally moving acting, but as a Friday night mindless fun action movie, it's everything that it should be.<br /><br />When two perfectly dull and normal people receive a mysterious phone call telling them they have been "activated" as sleeper terrorists that they didn't even know they were supposed to be, they react with realistic shock, confusion, and refusal to act. Shia's character reacts particularly realistically, certain that his chances are better with the FBI agents who have taken him into custody and only fleeing when the alternative is to be shot and killed. Equally realistically, both of the "activated" people react with hostility and suspicion towards the other, convinced that the other may not be as innocent as they know that they themselves are.<br /><br />The plot unfolds quickly and manically, with just enough "catch up" explanations to keep the viewer in the loop (and plenty of "Oh, THAT's why..." moments) without ever devolving into a derailing exposition monologue. The 'good guys' catch on to the real story much faster than in your average "everyone must be dumb to facilitate the plot" story and the villain behind the mysterious phone calls has a nice, if slightly predictable twist. All the acting is done surprisingly well, which is just that much more proof that an action movie doesn't require a bunch of big name actors to be decent. And I was particularly pleased that while the movie did finally succumb to the mandatory "we have to fall in love now" nonsense that every action/adventure movie seems to adhere to, the love interest material was kept to a severe minimum and left until the very end of the movie - a nice choice, in my opinion.<br /><br />"Eagle Eye" isn't perfect, but the flaws it suffers from are the usual action-movie flaws that can't really be avoided. The super-computer shouldn't be able to tap remotely into so many devices, and I'm pretty sure that you can't remotely blow up power wires on the power grid (why would you program in that particular little ability?). Why is the experimental medicine locked in a time-case (designed to look like a bomb timer) and carried by a security detail, but the government's new powerful explosive is being sent by regular USPS? Why does the super-computer wait until everything goes wrong before attempting a back-up? And there's really no reason other than tragic suspense to have the little boy's trumpet be the trigger for the bomb - if there are speakers in that building, the computer should be able to remotely generate the necessary sound to trigger the explosives. I tried to come up with a "first law" reason for why this wasn't done, but considering how often the super-computer directly kills people, that explanation just doesn't seem to work.<br /><br />I don't know if this movie deserves accolades when compared to every movie ever made, but "Eagle Eye" was definitely the most fun action movie I've seen this year and I'm grateful for that.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Rarely has so much money and effort been spent for so little in return.

They make their way to Washington, D.C. and finally find out who is controlling their every move.<br /><br />I've enjoyed Shia LaBeouf before and was expecting another movie showcasing his boyish charm.  Sadly, this film didn't give him a chance to really shine; it's just one frantic, chaotic, mad dash from place to place with a bunch of explosions and implausible escapes from death.  The intensity level is always at 99% which leaves no time to really get to know LaBeouf's character.  He's in a constant state of fear and we don't know why until the very end.  The voice on the phone telling Jerry what to do and where to go has the ability to control any and all machines and systems he comes in contact with; this starts out pretty preposterous and goes all the way to "Huh?!"<br /><br />None of the incredible, non-stop action scenes could really happen, but if you love explosions and don't need a story that makes sense, this is the movie for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Is Shia LeBeouf in too many movies? He sure is in a lot these days. I guess that I'm just getting old and I don't see the "coolness" in this guy. Or maybe I'm just tired of seeing and hearing the same personality in every movie that he's in. That's not acting. Heath Ledger in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GZ6QEC">The Dark Knight</a>...now THAT'S acting.<br /><br />Anyway, the first movie that I really noticed LeBeouf in, albeit briefly, was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012GVKVY">I, Robot</a>. And what a coincidence!...LeBeouf is now in a movie called Eagle Eye that steals the underlying principle of I, Robot. The rip-off was simply blatant to me. I don't want to spoil Eagle Eye for you if you're determined to see it, but, man, if you've not seen I, Robot and you're on the fence about Eagle Eye...just go with I, Robot.<br /><br />Eagle Eye has LeBeouf in the role of an ordinary guy that is suddenly thrust into the position of defending our national security...just like he was in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NTPDT6">Transformers</a>. And like in Transformers, in Eagle Eye LeBeouf magically "transforms" into a super-soldier that can handle almost any situation. But it ain't easy being a super-soldier when you're up against a foe that can use anything...I mean ANYTHING...with a lens or something that can pick up sound waves to eavesdrop in on you're every move.<br /><br />Making a very good movie is certainly not beyond Eagle Director DJ Caruso; he just seems to prefer over the top lately. Eagle Eye is so far over the top it's at the bottom of the other side. Caruso's last movie, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RO6K80">Disturbia</a>, (that also starred LeBeouf) wasn't as far-fetched, but it was still over the top. However, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018BZD8E">Taking Lives</a> showed that Caruso has it in him to put out a better film.<br /><br />Joining LeBeouf is a pretty decent cast, including Billy Bob Thornton and Michael Chiklis. But the good cast doesn't come close to making up for how unrealistic Eagle Eye is by the time it's all said and done.<br /><br />Like I said before: Eagle Eye is very similar to I, Robot...except I, Robot was very good...Eagle Eye isn't! Go with I, Robot.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KW2KWKABNYNO.html">A2KW2KWKABNYNO</a><br/><p>If you want an action movie you can awe at and lose yourself in, then Eagle Eye is your ticket. If you're looking for serious and realistic movie that's meant to give you a debate on big brother government and terrorist tactics, then go get 'The Bourne Ultimatum.' This movie on the other hand is a tense action thriller that keeps you guessing, and some true jaw-dropping scenes. It's almost non-stop movement, and it's movement that keeps you on your edge. Make no mistake about it, Eagle Eye is an action thriller.<br /><br />Story-wise, Shia LaBeouf is a slacker that works in a 'Copy Cabana,' who strives for independence, even though he's not very good at it. Michelle Monaghan is a somewhat happy single mother who just sent her son of to play trumpet at the Lincoln Center. Then all the sudden, Julianne Moore calls them their cellphones, and even gives directions on random TV and various other electronic screens, and she won't take voicemail or no for an answer. As it turns out, she does not want pizza, but rather intends to guide them to Washington DC to carry out an elaborate conspiracy. Oh, did I mention some anti-terrorist government officials are after them?<br /><br />On its surface, the premise of Eagle Eye is actually quite compelling, and keeps your attention throughout the movie. It's only about 3/4s through I started noticing it shared some similarities to Will Smith's 'I-Robot.' In either case, while some parts may be original, the overall story really isn't, but again, this isn't the type of movie you dissect like that. Sure, it calls into question terrorism methods, and spying, but that's not the point of the movie. The point of the movie is to have a good time. And not to give too much away, I'd rather Shia's character kick the bucket at the end, sacrificing his life, as it could have made for a strong movie all the way around.<br /><br />But overall, Eagle Eye is a great popcorn flick, and a conspiracy action thriller. The cast does a great job, the crew does a nice job, the story keeps you interested, and the action is jaw-dropping sequence after sequence. Rent it, buy it, it's a great watch. Just don't over-think it.</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>Eagle Eye is based on a Spielberg concept and executive produced by him. Spielberg is famous for successfully incorporating technical elements from famous films and directors into his own films but never quite developing his characters equal to the masters. Taking a cue from Spielberg, director D.J. Caruso has decided to shoot a film that is virtually all action and has virtually no character development. Take Shia LaBeouf's character, 'Jerry Shaw'. LaBeouf's plays him over the top, constantly angry and fighting with everybody, starting with his father (who he hates), spurning his offer to pay his tuition and return to college at Stanford where he had dropped out two years earlier. There is virtually nothing likable about our protagonist from the beginning! When a secret Department of Defense computer named Aria goes berserk and deposits over $700,000 into Shaw's bank account and then dumps a cache of terrorists' weapons in his apartment, leading to his arrest by the FBI, Shaw has to figure out who has set him up. He ends up escaping from the FBI's clutches with the help of the computer and then being paired with Michelle Monaghan who plays 'Rachel Holloman', a divorced single mother.<br /><br />Jerry and Rachel are ordered about by this computer under pain of death to go to and fro to all kinds of crazy locations, fulfilling the computer's various commands that don't seem to have a discernible purpose. The computer stays in contact with our two protagonists by all means of computer connected gadgetry (principally cell phones) but also at times through electronic devices (such as LCD screens at the subway) that are not ostensibly connected to computers. At first Jerry and Rachel are yelling at each other all the time but gradually come to realize that they have been victimized by a common enemy. In addition to surviving numerous car chases (which are edited so poorly, it's often impossible to know what's going on), they suddenly find the moxie to disarm armored truck guards. Meanwhile, they're being chased by an FBI agent played by an unhealthy looking Billy Bob Thornton who injects no humor, charm or wit into the role. The same goes for Zoe Perez who plays a Department of Defense investigator who eventually discovers why the computer has gone berserk. It seems that the computer has decided to eliminate the President and his underlings after the Military fails to heed its advice to abort a mission to kill a terrorist utilizing a drone somewhere in Afghanistan (or some nearby terrorist haven). The computer was 'locked' at the last second by Shaw's twin brother who mysteriously dies in a car accident at the beginning of the movie. The computer needs Jerry to unlock the command and eventually summons him to her lair.<br /><br />Eagle Eye borrows heavily from superior films such as I, Robot and Terminator II where the protagonist must disable the computer to keep it from committing its nefarious acts. I can't remember the exact manner in which Zoe Perez actually disables "Aria" here in Eagle Eye but the computer 'takedown' by Will Smith and Arnold Schwarzenegger in their respective films is much more exciting and sophisticated than what is depicted here.<br /><br />In an awkward tribute to Hitchcock's "The Man Who Knew Too Much", Shia is given the Jimmy Stewart part where he must prevent Rachel's son from hitting a high note while playing the Star Spangled Banner on his trumpet at the White House. The note will trigger an explosion that will eliminate the US chain of command from the President on down (In "The Man Who Knew Too Much", Jimmy Stewart must prevent the assassination of a world leader while a symphony orchestra also hits a 'high note--masking the sound of the assassin's bullet). In addition to LaBeouf's one-note performance, my main problem with the film was that I couldn't understand why such a logical entity as a computer would be so illogical in constructing such a convoluted plot to accomplish its goals. What's surprising about Eagle Eye is that it actually starts out realistically (the botched terrorist strike actually looks like something that could happen!). I understand that action-adventure films aren't supposed to be 'realistic' but shouldn't they conform to some kind of internal logical? Unfortunately, logic is almost completely lacking here.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>Remember 40 years ago, there was a movie brought out called 2001: A Space Odyssey and it is long considered one of Stanley Kubricks greatest works? Well in that movie it contained a short story involving an advanced computer called HAL, who gained independent intelligence and tried to eliminate all astronauts on board his space station. That idea has been parodied and ripped off so many times it's laughable, with the TV shows such as The Simpsons and Futurama giving their own parody of it along with the most recent movie Stealth using the idea as a basis for their own movie. Hell, it even sort of looked like HAL and if that's not a ripoff I don't know what is, seriously.<br /><br />Eagle Eye is no exception to that rule as it takes the HAL idea of a powerful computer killing people and taking control and puts a terrorism twist on it. Jerry Shaw is the twin brother of Ethan Shaw, a soldier we're first lead to believe is killed in some form of action. After that event Jerry gets home to his apartment to find it's filled with munitions supplies and explosive chemicals. He receives a call from a female telling him the FBI are about to enter his apartment to arrest him and to get out. On the other side, Rachel Holloman gets a call from the same woman who tells her that her son Sam will be killed unless she follows the instructions. Jerry is caught by the FBI the first time, but the woman on the phone who's hacked into all United States networks breaks him out by smashing a crane into the building allowing Jerry an escape route. Jerry winds up with Rachel and it now leads into a chase/mission for them to try and save their own necks by following the womans instructions and keep from getting caught by the FBI who suspect them of being Cyber Terrorists. About a quarter into the film we find out that the woman on the phone is an artificially intelligent super computer located in the Pentagon. It's reason for creation is to automatically seek out, monitor and alert the authorities of a suspected threat to national security (this one again looks like HAL).<br /><br />Although the blatant ripoff material is there, this is still an intensely enjoyable film with some of the best action sequences I've seen in a film this year. The acting by Shia Labeouf and even Billy Bob Thornton is excellent, obviously the supporting actress of Michelle Monoghan is something great and again Shia delivers a stellar performance, constantly cementing his status as an all round excellent actor. A top 10 movie of 08 for me and we've had some excellent movies this year, so that's saying something.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Every single aspect of Eagle Eye has been done before, and better.  Aside from that FACT, the rest of it is just convoluted eye candy meant to put the majority of easily persuaded viewers into a trance.  Last but not least, it's a message movie, with an obvious political axe to grind from a Hollywood crowd bereft of any leverage in the moral landscape.<br /><br />Essentially, Eagle Eye is a top secret government computer system meant to predict crime (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000063W29">Minority Report</a>) by using every electronic resource networked together to eavesdrop and anticipate wrong-doing.  When a complicated political assassination attempt goes awry (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012QCZ5O">Vantage Point</a>), and against the computer's calculated recommendation, Eagle Eye becomes self-aware and decides to take over (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005N5S5">The Terminator</a>).  Countless humans, including the majority of the Order of Succession, are on the most wanted list.<br /><br />Caught in the conspiracy theory (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304708793">Conspiracy Theory</a>) of government corruption, cover up, and ubiquitous clandestine sources of observation - big brother is watching (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305428115">Enemy of the State</a>) - Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan are led around on a goose chase via mysterious phone voice that knows everything (Matrix), as the story takes about 400 plot twists and turns mistakenly meant to distract and amaze the viewers (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0752264877">Ocean's Eleven</a>).  There are countless moments in the movie's "plot" in which the ridiculously intricate details that deliver Shia and Michelle throughout Chicago (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00001MXXH">Ferris Bueller's Day Off</a>) and cross-country to the Pentagon can be questioned.  The what-ifs challenging the sequences of this movie are boundless.  If even one minor detail were to change, the movie fails (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1844160815">The Butterfly Effect</a>).  And the train sequence (stolen from movies too numerous to mention) does not provide sufficient convincing that the powers behind the voice leading the duo could orchestrate new ways to force participants' hands.  Sooner or later makers of movies like this have to watch Tom and Jerry to realize that the 43-step mouse trap doesn't work, except in cartoons.  The only aspect of the movie that is truly believable is that Shia Lebouf, much like his character in this movie, has been led around like a puppy on a leash, choosing one bad movie after another.<br /><br />It's average, somewhat interesting, but nothing all that great.  I recommend it if you can't find anything other than infomercials on TV.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>I was very entertained by the first forty minutes but when my friend told me it's a great film, I had my doubts, I waited for the film to settle down and then give it a rethink. One hour into the film, I was hoping it wouldn't stretch too long. Not because I was sleepy but because I realized what a poor script it is. And just when I started to think this Shia guy isn't as bad as I've always thought he was, I realized he is what is wrong with this film. The film is not clever at all. There are many scenes that last for less than one second, almost all are action filled. In the second half, it is a jumble of storylines, twists, concerned eyes, speed and self loveth logic. The actress was horried and so was pretty much everyone invovled in the plot. I don't understand what is wrong with three of my friends who loved this film. The lowest rating they gave it was an 8/10 and they almost looked hurt when I told them what I thought.<br /><br />Shia is not a good actor. He should go back and get a degree or two and try to save our economy. The actress has bad skin and made it difficult for me to concentrate on her dialogues. The film never really settles down and when it does it looks campy, cheesy and torturous. Believe me, by no strength of imagination am I the sort of person who considers his time of prime importance, but this film gave me quite a moodswing.<br /><br />I know it will be a hit and I'm happy the producers will get there money worth. I realize I like the other two films by the actor more. I think it was a waste of good resources. Wanted was better and tolerable.<br /><br />This is the sort of film that will make it big on movie rentals but it's just so badly directed.<br /><br />I loved Billy Bob Thorton in The Man Who Wasn't There but I must say the man gets really silly roles and aside from the Coen brothers collaboration, he hasn't done one single worthy film.<br /><br />I rest my case, the Entourage episode in the morning was today's highlight.<br /><br />bye.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UNMXBJSVIXFB.html">A2UNMXBJSVIXFB</a><br/><p>Movie - 4.0<br /><br />When I first saw the trailer, I had no clue what the movie would turn out to be other than some kind of conspiracy-thriller.  To my surprise, I saw it in theaters with a friend and enjoyed it, mainly for the chasing around, but also for the characters and the subtle philosophical conspiracies of privacy, control, and over-reliance on technology (which a lot of these titles usually do).  In particular, I really like Jerry Shaw (played by Shia LaBeouf) and the way he progresses through the movie.  His journey strikes me as a sort of intrinsic desire that everyone has to try their hardest in order to make an honest living, with some of us making it higher on the social chain, while others are.. well, not so fortunate.  Not that there's anything wrong with a social gap, for the pros and cons of every person are unique and useful in their own way (as we see in this movie).  I just think his initial circumstances and the results by the end of the film make for an entertaining, yet heartwarming experience.  The one problem I do have, however, is with the suspension of disbelief.  Now, I'm all for the outrageous and unbelievable (this coming from a guy who watches anime), but the concept of ARIA just feels a tad too out-of-touch with reality.  Everything in the movie before "her" actual appearance feels so realistic, almost gritty.  Then to be presented with what "she" is kinda' takes away that built up realism.  And because of that, I recommend that if you haven't seen this movie yet, that you take it with a grain of salt and consider this more of a popcorn flick, rather than a full-blown conspiracy-thriller with real-world machinations.  Keep your imagination open and you'll probably enjoy it.<br /><br />Video - 4.5<br /><br />Eagle Eye is presented to us by DreamWorks in MPEG-4 AVC with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  As I mentioned about enjoying most of the grittiness early on in the film, the visual style represents that feeling very well.  About half the of movie takes place in dark areas or at nighttime, so blacks levels are very important and do not disappoint.  Dark clothing, shadows, and pitch black darkness separate pretty well from one another, giving the overall film a great sense of realism and depth.  Accordingly, daytime and well-lit scenes also do an adequate job of displaying colors and contrast, exposing the finer details in flesh tones, backgrounds, objects, etc.  Some inconsistent levels of grain are present through a few shots, making this just short of demo material.  But given that the movie itself isn't even supposed to be that flashy, it's an excellent transfer, nonetheless.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />In addition to a near-flawless video encode, DreamWorks also provides a VERY capable TrueHD 5.1 track.  Dynamic range in combination with LFEs are most present during chase sequences and are accompanied by a bombastic musical score composed by Brian Tyler, who uses quite a bit of percussion, giving the overall sound stage a nice oomph to the sub-woofer.  Directionality goes from subtle to chaotic in the blink of an eye when on-screen action gets hectic, sending all sorts of sound effects from left to right, through the front, and back to the rears.  Dialogue is crisp and clear (yes, even Billy Bob sounds coherent) with zero dropout or discrepancy.  I was pleasantly surprised at how great this sounded, given it's not even an all-out action flick.  The car chase scene is reference quality.<br /><br />Extras - 4.0<br /><br />I always love seeing well-made production segments.  It shows me just how much work and effort goes into creating a film, giving me a greater sense of appreciation for what everyone in this industry seeks to accomplish.  While not as lengthy or in-depth as it could've been, the extras on this BD were enough to win me over.  The large majority of these extras include various interviews with director D.J. Caruso and other cast/crew, some brief commentary about the eerie reality of government privacy invasion, and then a few spots on design/shooting locale.  There's also a 7-minute gag reel, which I found hilarious given what Billy Bob was saying towards the end of it.<br /><br />Overall - 4.5<br /><br />Eagle Eye presents itself very well for a large majority of the movie.  It's an exhilarating conspiracy-thriller with lots of chases, plot twists, and even a little bit of character development.  That being said, the last small chunk at the end is a bit far fetched in comparison to everything prior.  But if you're willing to think outside the box and accept the unconventional here and there, you'll enjoy this.  Top that off with an almost-perfect video transfer and reference quality sound, and you've got a high recommendation on my part.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>The film Eagle Eye advertised itself as an action/adventure film with an aspect of goverment intruige ("Big Brother is watching").  While the film definately delivers in the action department, there really isn't much else to it.<br /><br />The basic plot of the film centers on two ordinary people who are suddenly "activated" as terrorists and must flee for there lives while only taking mesages from all the electronic devices around them (cell phones, billboards, streaming text lines, LED signs, etc.).  As they continue to flee, they eventually figure out what is happening to them and begin hatching a plan to stop it.<br /><br />The reason why this movie fails, though, is that is doesn't focuses on the dramatic elements that are actually interesting.  Without giving any spoilers, the film would have been much better served focusing on two areas: 1. The technology behind why the two U.S. citizens are "activated" in the first place; and 2. The relationship between the two lead characters played by Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan.<br /><br />Instead, however, this film is little more than one pulse-pounding action sequence after another with just enough (but much too little) exposition to move the plot forward to the next crazy chase scene.  Plus, the focus of the film seemed to be on the fact that the two citizens can be communicated with or found by any electronic device.  However, it covered much of the same territory that Will Smith and Gene Hackman did in Enemy of the State a decade ago.  There wasn't enough new material to really hook me into this plot thread.<br /><br />Thus, if you a huge fan of non-stop action in films, you will love this film.  If you need some character and plot development to keep your interest, though, then skip this movie, as you will just be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7.html">A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7</a><br/><p>Eagle Eye is a good movie, I really don't understand why some people say they don't like it.

The story is completely unbelievable, terribly ridiculous, far more complicated than it needs to be, and seems obsessed with displaying the marvels of technology.  Spoilers follow, so proceed as you will.<br /><br />The premise of a master computer running amok has been explored before, in films like 2001 (1968), Colossus: The Forbin Project (1970), and War Games (1983), just to name a few.  Eagle Eye follows along similar lines, as an incredibly sophisticated government computer named ARIA has become misguided, and has instituted an overly complex and intricate set of operations, intended to eliminate the President and most of the cabinet.  ARIA has the ability to do some amazing things, but instead of taking a more straightforward approach, "she" takes a most obscure and roundabout route to accomplishing its mission.<br /><br />Chicago resident Jerry Shaw (Shia LeBeouf), is drawn into ARIA's scheme, after his twin brother Ethan, an Air Force officer who works with ARIA, is killed.  Jerry is arrested by the FBI as a suspected terrorist, and questioned by special agent Tom Morgan (Billy Bob Thornton).  In a device that quickly becomes overused, Jerry receives phone calls and other forms of messages from ARIA, giving him directions, or pointers on how to evade capture.  With ARIA's guidance, Jerry escapes from FBI custody, and hooks up with Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monahan), who is also following ARIA's instructions, in order to save her son's life.<br /><br />The pair survives a wild car chase, and then travel from Chicago to Indianapolis, where they commit an armed robbery.  Morgan is not far behind, and almost catches them after a circuitous pursuit through the baggage handling system at the Dayton airport.  Monahan and LaBeouf work well together, and their characters behave in a mostly plausible manner, despite being put a series of extremely ridiculous and convoluted gyrations, on their way to the Pentagon.  Thornton is also very solid, as the dogged FBI agent.<br /><br />The script goes to great lengths attempting to be clever, and amaze the viewer with ARIA's capabilities, but instead it mostly comes off as being gimmicky, extremely silly, and lacking any believability.  The worst aspect probably concerns ARIA itself, a high tech monstrosity with crazy architecture that is cooled by liquid nitrogen.  Like nearly every mega-computer in a Hollywood movie, the computer speaks in a human voice (in this case Julianne Moore's), describing step by step what it is doing, or what is happening.  Computer speech is just a plot device that has simply been done to death, as has the master computer gone wild idea.<br /><br />Eagle Eye features some good acting performances, and nicely executed action scenes, but the story that ties them together is unoriginal and without much substance.  Like many big budget Hollywood productions, the approach is to dazzle the audience, so that they don't notice that the cool thing they are watching, makes little sense within the context of the story.  Eagle Eye certainly does entertain, but the adventure that you are supposed to be intrigued by and be invested in, is actually ridiculously laughable fluff.  This one rates 2.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A86R2KZIFHKLB.html">A86R2KZIFHKLB</a><br/><p>What we have is a good suspension of everyday belief.

So, yeah here I am reviewing Eagle Eye and though LeBeouf still hasn't impressed me with his range, the film itself did most definitely hit the spot. It was an exciting, fast-paced, action-packed thriller and a comparison to films like WarGames and 2001: The Year We Made Contact would be quite accurate as they share many similarities.<br /><br />There really wasn't much about this film I didn't like and that includes the CG action sequences and, yes, LeBeouf's performance, despite it being indistinguishable from roles he's played prior to this film.

EAGLE EYE is so low, I wonder how many people actually saw it.<br /><br />Well, I suspect you know the drill on this one, so my personal observation-critique will be the standard for this one.<br /><br />I think Shia is very sexy in this film, and he had a bit of that just beginning in the original TRANSFORMERS. Here, I thought it was a massive stroke of genius to make him a twin whose over-achieving military officer brother has died. It is this brother that is the major key in the film, and me likey! It means more imagination, less BS.

That wasn't too bad, considering the drama and suspense this film gives us. Shia's performance, though at times I think maybe a bit tepid, is intense. I love his eyes.<br /><br />That is where I am leaving it. My opinion is you need to see this film for yourself, as it seems so few people saw it.

The destruction hands of the cranes and of the powerlines are two most impressive ones in the movie. Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan are excellent in portraying the "pawns" of the brain behind the secret - they are intelligent, sharp and being involuntarily involved in the big conspiracy exhibit a strong sense of helplessness and hence develop a convincibly strong bond with one another. One can feel their pressing need to survive and use all the wits one gets to figure out what comes next.<br /><br />It's thus a delight to watch an action packed movie which is fluid in story telling, mind provoking and unorthodox. You can actually sit back with your mind totally immersed in the movie for a couple of hours. Surprise and suspence, not romance, are abundant. Yet it does not make the movie anything less than what it should be. Very worth watching.</p></br></body></html>

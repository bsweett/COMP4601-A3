Will Smith's first romantic comedy is excellent and his performance is excellent. Eva Mendes and Kevin James are excellent.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F.html">A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F</a><br/><p>I rented this movie in the hope that I would laugh, but I didn't. I wanted to like the movie, but I couldn't because it just seemed to predictable. But the thing that annoyed me is the fact that I've seen EVERYTHING in this film done so many times better.<br /><br />Will Smith is the same character he always plays. It's getting a little old. Kevin James is good, but he could have been better. Alot of parts in the movie consist of Kevin James being overly clumsy, and it just seems like a cop out. Amber Valletta seems like the only person taking the movie seriously, and it's refreshing to see someone who isn't acting goofy every 8 seconds. Eva Mendes is terrible. She just isn't likeable or funny. There are some actors who just aren't likeable, and I think she is one of them.<br /><br />Aside from the actors, the script is bland and it's getting old. I'm not saying I hate romantic comedies, but this one has been done so many times. Near the end of the movie the relationships fall apart, and everyone seems to be doing their hardest to be mad at each other. I think you can guess what happens at the end.<br /><br />Stay away from this movie, unless you like not laughing and stupid movies.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>It appears as though you only need one surprise-hit film, one more notably found during a time period at the box office that has been particularly dead-silent for movie studios in years past, in order to make a name for yourself in Hollywood, or at least in the romance genre of the film industry. After bursting out of the gate big time in September 2002 with Sweet Home Alabama, the Reese Witherspoon romantic comedy which went on to gross close to one-hundred and thirty million dollars domestically, Andy Tennant, whose directorial credentials have been severely limited to a small number of lackluster features such as Ever After and Anna & the King, now helms marquee name Will Smith in a more ambitious, and therefore more highly-anticipated, film but the question still remains as to whether he truly has what it takes inside to deliver the hit film the studio needs whenever they demand it of him.<br /><br />The story centers on the man who thought he knew everything there is to know about getting a man to sweep the love of his life off her feet and how it had it all wrong when a cynical woman walks into his life. Alex Hitchens, also known as Hitch, has been declared the date doctor amongst his clientele within New York City by helping the desperate men who contact him to land the love of their lives. His philosophy of relationships is actually quite simple - any man can sweep any woman off her feet; he just needs the right broom. His next client is a bank accountant named Albert, who is about as clumsy and downright pathetic as a person of his age can get but still maintains a quality that makes him admirable. While he helps Albert attempt to pull off what seems like the impossible, Alex falls head over heels for a beautiful woman named Sara, a gossip columnist with a cynical view on both men, which is that they are only out for the next woman to land in bed with, and life in general. Sadly, in spite of his extensive list of past cliental success thanks to his techniques, this time around he can not seem to get his practices right around her and yet she still remains attracted to him despite this. The story for Hitch follows in the hollow footsteps of every other romantic-comedy feature that has come before its time, adhering to the same basic blueprint storyline and committing the exact sins and vices as has been accustomed for audiences, boyfriends at least, but in turn does so with such convincing style and flare that it does not become a hindrance at all. Andy Tennant, the director who also helmed the Reese Witherspoon surprise-hit, Sweet Home Alabama, has clearly acquired a knack of sorts for this particular genre, or maybe it actually is more along the lines of hand-picking the right actors, or actresses, in the lead roles that allows these films to connect with audiences so readily. In any event, Hitch's meritable message that in spite of our best intentions there are no magic formulas, potions, or specific game plans to tie down the love of our lives, if we are even aware of it at the time we meet them, and we have only to be ourselves to find acceptance makes the whole two-hours effort worth the price of admission, especially on a Valentine's Day weekend.<br /><br />Will Smith is positively charming, witty, and, must it be said, stylish in the role of Alex Hitchens, also known as the date doctor. The romantic-comedy genre, or comedies in general, is the precise arena in which Smith should use to his benefit his charming comedic stick as opposed to dramas of a semi-seriousness nature, I Robot being a prominent example, where it tends to throw off the flow of the storyline for its audience. Sure, there are some questions left unanswered as to how Hitch went from being a geeky lovelorn loser as he was back in college to the classy professional he is today, but its audience automatically accepts the notion that it just happened. It is after all a romantic comedy, is it not? Would you truly come to expect clear and precise logic or reason from this genre? On the other hand though, unlike films of this specific genre, there appears quite an equal balance in the amount of screen time, if not the quality of their particular scenes together or separate, between Will Smith's Alex Hitchens and Eva Mendes' Sara, of which she performs adequately well. There may be a time in the not too distant future that she could stray away from the usual eye-candy or limited comedic roles she has been reduced to over the last few years but as it works for her at the moment there are truly no complaints with her performance. As had been abundantly clear in the film's trailer leading up to its release, Kevin James, star of the CBS prime-time television series King of Queens, undoubtedly steals the spotlight, if only for a short period of time, from his fellow co-stars in Hitch, which for once is actually a fantastic quality to have seeing as how this is first major film role. Every single scene he makes an appearance in goes practically without a single misstep, or at least nothing that was noteworthy that is. Now if only lead roles, of which he will receive in the not too distant future, will be as easily accomplished as this.<br /><br />Overall, Hitch more then states the obvious in its observations about relationships, which is bluntly that men are bumbling idiots when it comes to love and women are nearly as clueless as they are (though certainly less commonly or explicitly), which certainly not advance within the field of love if that is what you were hoping for. But, on the more optimistic side of things, this film does conveniently provide with an opportunity to take that special someone out to catch a charming, if not often clich&eacute; filled, romantic comedy. Here is yet another example of a high-profile feature in which a fair majority of the gags found within this two-hour film are visibly present, either entirely or partially, in its trailer. The surprising quality of Hitch, as opposed to so many other projects that have fallen flat on their face in part to this horrendous marketing move, is that when these elements are placed within the proper contexts of the script they become more humorous then they had been beforehand. This helps separate this picture from the rest of the drawn-out romantic comedy pack that has plagued movie theaters the past few years. A small problem the film tends to run into occasionally, only when either the direction or the script calls for it to be this way, is that the dialogue and the actions of the characters onscreen become overtly, border-line excruciatingly, clich&eacute;d. But, when you think about seriously, is this not the curse of every romantic comedy churned out by Hollywood within the past decade, if not longer? Another fate of chick-flicks' past that this film has managed successfully to avoid is the bubble-gum pop laden soundtrack, which, though rarely addictive, happens to have worn out its inventiveness. Bottom-line, Hitch gets its point across though in the fact that through our lives we will have the fortunate opportunity to meet a wide-range of astonishing individuals who click instantly with us, many of whom we will be forced to lose at some point or another. But unless we are willing to take the risk involved and face rejection and heartache on occasion, we will never know for sure and that will be a fate worse then anything else life can throw at you. As the date-doctor himself so eloquently put it, any man can truly sweep any woman off her feet; he just needs the right broom to do it, which is whatever you want to make of it in your life.</p></br><a href="../users/A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL.html">A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL</a><br/><p>Wow.  What a let down.  After hearing so many people saying how much they thought this was funny and great, I looked forward to seeing this movie.  I saw it last night and almost fell asleep.  I think I laughed once throughout the whole movie.  I love Kevin James and he's always funny in the King of Queens, but this wasn't the way he should have broken out into film.  Will Smith was way too smooth and Amber Valeta should stick to modeling while she still has half her looks.  Even if this was truely funny, all the funny parts have been shown on TV Trailers for so long, that the semi-good parts weren't new to me.  I'm sorry to disagree with you all, - this was a big waste of time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JPFWKS83R49V.html">A3JPFWKS83R49V</a><br/><p>Will Smith stars in this movie as Alex Hitchens, a suave, smooth- talking fellow who knows his business and performs it well. The thing that makes the situation a little different is that Alex isn't in a traditional business. No, "Hitch" (as people call him) is in the business of love. He helps shy, awkward men find dates by coaching them on the right things to say and the right gestures to make. He is convinced that a man can get any woman if he follows the rules.<br /><br />Smith is the star of this movie, and he fits the part very well. It doesn't hurt that he has a fine supporting cast to back him up, including the likes of Kevin James, Eva Mendes, and Amber Valletta. I felt they all played their respective roles quite nicely, although I did find Eva Mendes character a little annoying after a while. On the other hand, Mendes is the one person who provides some suspense. She is a gossip columnist and the love interest of Will Smith. She isn't completely stable and she has erected an emotional fence when it comes to men. You don't really know what she is going to do from one scene to the next, and this makes her character a little more entertaining.<br /><br />What I like best about Hitch is that it gets you thinking about certain issues about dating, attraction, and ethics. Smith's character is convinced that a man can get the woman of his dreams, even if he isn't very good looking in comparison. There is some truth to this. I don't think any man can get any woman, but it is generally easier for a man with average or below average looks to get a girl who looks better than the other way around. Also, as Smith's character points out near the end, he only provides a catalyst for his clients to get the woman they want. What he is doing is ethical because it is the client himself that is really doing the work. If a relationship isn't meant to be, then no amount of coaching will help.<br /><br />One thing that I didn't like about this movie occurred near the beginning when Smith talked directly to the camera. Unless a film is a documentary, I don't think it's a good idea to have the actors and actresses talk to the camera, like they know a film is being made. Besides that, I think the pacing could have been picked up a little bit in places, too. But overall, "Hitch" still ranks as a good, entertaining motion picture. The performances and the messages it sends about dating make it worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>I expected a good movie. What I got was an even better movie. The chemistry between James and Smith is just incredible. Glad to see him in a major motion picture for once!<br /><br />The movie works, because the actors play their parts perfectly. Will Smith is fantastic with his never ending charm; Kevin James is hilarious, and Eva Mendes...well, let's just say she plays that bitch/sweet/annoying role to the best of her ability.<br /><br />What I loved about the movie was the fact that Will Smith didn't even have to try to be lovable. He just was!! The "date doctor" had all the right moves, said everything in the most perfect of ways, and never ever went over the top.<br /><br />The funny parts are hilarious...and the cute, romantic parts are unforgettable.<br /><br />I totally recommend this movie. And no, it is not a chick flick.</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>Hitch is a movie that hooks the viewer right from the start.  The plot is original and fun.  Will Smith plays his character, Alex Hitchens, brilliantly!  I found myself actually rotting for "Hitch", otherwise known as "The Date Doctor", to help his clients attract the attention, and hopefully love, from their favorite members of the opposite sex.<br /><br />Smith has once again proven his ability as a star on the big screen.  He and his costars, Eva Mendez (Sara), Kevin James (Albert), Amber Valletta (Allegra Cole), and Julie Ann Emery (Casey), worked magic on the screen.  I judge all movies by how well the film grabs me, taking me on a ride that I forget it isn't real life I'm seeing.  Hitch has such great chemistry between the actors and actresses that I actually forgot I was watching a movie and just sat back and enjoyed the interaction between characters.  The director did a good job cutting out some of the scenes originally included in the filming.  Those were the only scenes that didn't quite work.<br /><br />When Will Smith and Kevin James are on screen together, they are hilarious.  The two reminded me of the same on screen chemistry Chris Farley and David Spade used to have on screen.  Now throw in the amazing Eva Mendez and this turns into a film that just can't miss.<br /><br />Hitch tries to help Albert get the woman of his dreams to notice he is even alive.  But Hitch doesn't stop there.  He teaches Albert how to make Allegra Cole not only notice him; he teaches him how to make her fall in love with him.  I won't give away the entire plot.  I'll just say this: If you are looking for a movie that has a little bit of everything in it, especially a script that should bring a smile to your face, you needn't look any further.  This is the movie.<br /><br />See ya next review</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>This movie is an absolute train wreck, a cumbersome, extremely talky affair, full of clunky stops and starts, and exhibiting all self-conscious ramblings of a particularly awkward first date. Dull, tedious, badly acted, and ploddingly directed, Hitch dedicates a full 120 minutes to the hilarious comic notion that men make bad dancers and that gorgeous model-like women will want them regardless of whether they are overweight, flabby bumbling fools.<br /><br />This appalling and condescendingly pedestrian film stars Will Smith who oozes considerable charm as Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, a successfully smooth Manhattan date doctor who, for a reasonable fee, will coach his fellow men, no matter how meek or mild, how to woo the woman of their dreams.<br /><br />Lately Hitch has had his hands full coaching timid corporate accountant Albert Brennaman (Kevin James), who's head-over-heels smitten with Allegra Cole (supermodel-actress Amber Valletta), a glamorous socialite who normally wouldn't give the likes of Albert a second glance, but is inexplicably attracted to him when he stands up for her, lambasting the corporate lawyers who are in charge of her inheritance.<br /><br />Although Hitch has never truly recovered from having his heart broken back in college, he suddenly finds himself attracted to Sara Melas (a dreadful Eva Mendes), a gossip reporter for the New York Standard tabloid who makes a living covering and uncovering the love affairs of the rich and famous but has yet to find her own Mr. Right.<br /><br />A conflict soon arises when the date doctor's prescription for love and happiness doesn't work quite as well, especially when he tries to woo the beautiful Sara. Hitch has to learn the tricky art of just being himself, rather than the person he thinks women want to see. When he tries to be all cool and smooth, he always ends up embarrassing himself and going home alone.<br /><br />Nothing in this story is remotely credible or involving. The romance feels stretched, strained, and overwrought and the story seems to take at least three months to get to its point. Apart from James, who instills his performance with a kind of wry comic irony, the rest of the cast is absolutely terrible, with the bad acting honors particularly reserved for Mendes who prances around with a mixture of strained embarrassment and forced, artificial emotion.<br /><br />There's absolutely no reason a silly romantic comedy should stretch out to an entire two hours, particularly when there's so little going on. Director Andy Tennant lets the pace run slow and slack, with too many scenes that are sluggish and leaden, and when they should be swift, and speedy. Mendes and Smith have next to no chemistry together and their emotional cues feel affectless and strained.<br /><br />On the positive side, Tennant demonstrates a good eye for locations, and gets the colorful Manhattan backdrop just right. He also chooses a number of fresh downtown venues and uses the waterfront along the Central Business district to great effect.

Call Hitch.  He will show you just what you need to do to win her over, and tell you what mistakes to avoid.  He knows all this from observation.  He has seen what works, and wants to share his knowledge.  On the down side, his own love life is sorely lacking.  Enter Sara, a gossip writer who catches Hitch's eye.  They go on a series of disasterous dates in which Hitch can do nothing right, but somehow a connection is made.  Of course, Sara is following a lead on the mythical date doctor, and you know that sooner or later, Hitch's secret will be revealed.<br /><br />Will Smith does a good job in his first romantic comedy, showing the screen presence that movie-goers have come to expect.  Kevin James steals almost every scene that he is in as the unlucky in love Albert.  They are the reasons that this movie works, and is very funny at times.  The story itself is predictable (as most romantic comedies are), but weaves a number of stories into an ending where everything comes together.  "Hitch" is a good date movie, and a funnier than average film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SYMLB8JSW5VD.html">A3SYMLB8JSW5VD</a><br/><p>This is such a great movie. The plot is about self-proclaimed date doctor played by Will Smith who helps men who have a hard time meeting women. He seems to have all the answers until fate would have it. He meets the women of his dreams played by Eva Mendes. But the date doctor can't seem to do anything right. That when the laughs begins. But the real star of this movie is Kevin James who's totally clueless yet funny at the same time trying to win his dream girl. This is flat-funny and a real treasure.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>I like Will Smith as an actor, but I'm not crazy about this movie. Ya it made me laugh a few times, but the rest of the time I was falling asleep.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q04XXGGED746.html">A3Q04XXGGED746</a><br/><p>In this comedy, Hitch, the "date doctor", helps discouraged single men connect with women. He doesn't just advise them--he hangs around and monitors their performance. He begins by saying that women don't really mean it when they say that they are just into their careers, etc. He coaches men according to the principle that most communication is through body language. For instance, he tells men that, when a woman wants no kiss at the end of the date, she just takes out her keys and opens the door. But when she does want a goodnight kiss, she fiddles around with her keys. That is the signal for men to watch for.<br /><br />The "date doctor' succeeds with even seemingly-impossible cases. Albert, a taciturn, nerdy, heavyset, completely-bumbling fellow, gets dates with no less than Allegra, a popular beauty queen. Spectators can't believe it. In time, this makes it into the tabloids, provoking such a furious response in Albert that he trashes the store carrying the tabloids and gets himself arrested.<br /><br />Hitch's own girlfriend is Sara, who is highly cynical of men in general. She reacts with contempt when she learns of the very existence of a "date doctor", and then is furious with Hitch when she learns that he is in fact the one. She even throws things at him. Sara and the other women feel manipulated at the thought of their men's actions having been coached come-ons, not genuine romantic expressions.<br /><br />So Hitch's world seems to fall apart. The heartaches are unbearable. Can Hitch win back Sara? Will Albert get Allegra back? At the end of the movie, Hitch makes a statement that is very ironic in view of what he had been saying all along about men, dating, and women.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Alex Hitchens, "Hitch" to his friends (Will Smith), has a wonderful job.  He helps men get the women of their dreams by giving them dating tips and arranging situations where they can meet their current crushes.  Dubbed the "Date Doctor," Hitch operates by word of mouth.<br /><br />His latest client is Albert Brennaman (Kevin James), a nerdy accountant who is deeply in love with socialite Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta).  Even though Albert is way out of Allegra's league, Hitch begins to work his magic.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Hitch has met society columnist Sara Melas (Eva Mendes) and is doing his best to win her.  Sara is a tough cookie to crack, however, because her job reporting the break ups of others has made her extremely cynical.  Sara's pursuit of Allegra and Albert only makes things worse.  Will anyone find true love?<br /><br />I'm sure if I describe this romantic comedy as predictable, it won't come as any surprise to you.  I had the ultimate ending figured out long before the story really got going.  However, I was left wondering how exactly they'd reach that outcome.<br /><br />Even more importantly, the journey along the way was fun.  While I didn't laugh as much as my friends, I was often smiling when I wasn't cringing.  I'm not a fan of comedy from embarrassment, and that's some of the humor here.  However, watching Hitch in action is fun.  He is so smooth it is remarkable.<br /><br />Finally, the characters made me care about the outcome.  Sara was the only one it was hard to warm up to, and by the end I cared for her, too.  The acting was great, which really helped.<br /><br />This is one of those rare romantic comedies that everyone seems to enjoy.  So if you are looking for a light film, give this one a chance.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D.html">A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D</a><br/><p>Will Smith plays a "Date Doctor" who specializes in creating an opportunity for men to meet women of their dreams, for the long-term relationship.  Hitch played by Smith was once scourned as a college student and set up his current occupation.  He is very successful until one day he meets someone that he is interested in for the longer-term relationship and his current client help him see that love is worth everything.<br /><br />There are painful moments, there are hysterical moments, and in the end, it is a very good movie to watch and own.  Enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EISFBTLEQC69.html">A3EISFBTLEQC69</a><br/><p>I am totally entertained by Will Smith and this film.

I am not a big Will Smith fan.  I don't like Science Fiction.  Hated "Prince of Bel Aire."  Thought Men in Black was slack!  But I LOVE THIS MOVIE!  It really is fantastic!<br /><br />I have to say first of all, major kudos to the Music arranger and music writers.  I really loved the soundtrack selection, as well as the original sound recordings for this movie.  From the first hit song, playing during the opening arrangement, Hitche's intro, to the final notes, every song is dead on, and perfect.<br /><br />Michael Rappaport.  Can somebody explain to me why this guy isn't a bigger star getting bigger roles?  Is he somebody's buddy?  He plays every part he's in perfectly, and I wish we could see more of him.  He's in one short bar scene playing pool with Will Smith's character, as we get to know who Hitch really is.<br /><br />I also like Eva Mendes, and the other smaller roles throughout.  And of couse, Kevin James steals every scene he is in.  He really is a great physical comedian.  Every scene he is in made me scream with laugher.  I'm exaggerating a bit, but you know what I mean.<br /><br />I originally watched this on the UMD on my PSP, but I also rented it on DVD, and enjoyed the extras very much.  Commentary is great, and enjoyable.  I liked learning about the decisions about soundtrack, especially since I enjoyed it so much.<br /><br />Great twin storylines between Hitch and the Kevin James character. I liked the dance scene at the end, at their wedding.  I really liked this movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>Will Smith is brilliant in his comedic timing about how even the love expert can be a fool in love. Hitch meets Sarah (who is so scornful of romance she is like a doberman) and all his smooth talk goes awry. It's a typical "meet your match" that plays out in the gossip columns in New York. But when misunderstandings happen it's up to Hitch to let his own guard down to win Sarah back.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>I didn't have much anticipation for this film and I though this was a routine chick flick.  However, Will Smith shows that he can take any acting role given to him and make it work.  He's become a veteran entertainer.  This film surprised me.  Kevin James (King of Queens) is hilarious as the accountant, trying to win the heart of his boss.  Eva Mendes is a lovely presence on the screen as the gossip columnist who uncovers Hitch's secret.  The story is wonderful, original and doesn't take itself too seriously.  It's a refreshing change of pace and will entertain all who watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Hitch brings to the screen the story of a consultant who helps guys on their dates.

Overall, she is not convincing in her role.<br /><br />Aside from that, the setting and the plot are pretty good!<br /><br />In short, far from being a masterpiece, it is a movie worth watching as it will provide for an evening's entertainment, though you might not want to go as far as purchasing it.  3? Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>Since generally Will Smith is charming, versatile, and generally deserving of his celebrity status, this movie is never intolerable and is enjoyable enough the first time around.<br /><br />The problem arises when you try to watch it again.<br /><br />The main problem is the script, it seems to me, wasn't too well-thought out.  Here the Hitch character was supposed to be so super-smooth with women that bumbling men paid him thousands to give them advice, yet at the same time he was so dorky that, for example, he kicked his girlfriend in the face.<br /><br />The whole thing didn't add up.  It seemed like the filmmakers had two scripts:  one with Will Smith as a loveable dork moving around in the dating scene, and another with Will Smith as a ultra-slick master of the same scene.<br /><br />It seemed like they just combined the two scripts into one movie, hoping no one would notice.  But I did.<br /><br />Some precious quotes, though.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>What you are about to see in no way resembles real life.  There is no date doctor that will cut down the boundaries between two people to get them to meet up.  There is no way a beautiful and famous movie star would hook up with an unemployed accountant the way they did in the movie.  And when it comes to dialogue, people just don't talk the way they did in this movie.  So, if you are going to see this movie, please understand that reality is not reflected at all in this movie.<br /><br />But if you would like a silly and cute romantic comedy, then you might want to check this out.... at a video store.  I wouldn't recommend buying it because I think watching it once will be enough.<br /><br />But I do have a bone to pick with the humor of this movie.  Every single funny part of this movie was shown in the previews.  There was nothing really funny that I hadn't seen before watching the movie.  All that was left was the kind of funny parts.<br /><br />And, let's be honest, if this movie did not have Will Smith and Kevin James then it would have been a complete dud.  Why?  Because they are fantastic.<br /><br />First, Will Smith.  I've always loved Will Smith.  He has a charisma that carries naturally on the screen and I look forward to every movie he is in (okay, I haven't caught "Ali" yet).  Though he plays the same character in every movie (goofy, funny, full of energy, and loveable) he is still a character that I can't get enough of.  And he doesn't disappoint in this movie.  For a first venture into a romantic comedy I think he did well with the script provided him.<br /><br />And then Kevin James.  I haven't watched his show "King of Queens" and I don't know of any movie he has done, but I really hope to see more of Kevin James.  He did his role well and I couldn't think of anybody else that could have played that part better.  Kevin James nailed his character perfectly.  I see a great star rising.<br /><br />So, who should see this?  Well, anybody who likes a decent romantic comedy or even a regular comedy should watch it once.  Rent it, don't buy.  Only people who rushed to the theaters and still love it would want this in their collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZB8B7VQONZA6.html">A2ZB8B7VQONZA6</a><br/><p>First off I have to admit that the big reason I went to see this film was because Of "KING OF QUEENS" Kevin James, but it also helped that the very talented Will Smith is in this to. Director Andy Tennant did an excellent job with this film. Various types of humor are incorperated into the film as well as the romantic factor for all you date movie people. This would best be described as a Comedy with romantic elements, not a romantic comedy.<br /><br />We will start with the star Will Smith, I for one think it is great to see him in something else other then a big budget sci-fi flick again. And he did a excellent job in his first role in this type of film, his preformance is amazing. His charisma and screen precence make his character very belivable. Of course that changes after meeting his love, and he becomes a clumsy idiot, and he plays it greatly.<br /><br />That brings some one that was miscast, EVA MENDAS. I like her, infact I love her but she just didn't work in this role. She gave what she could, but the preformance wasn't belivable. That's all I can say about that, nothing more nothing less.<br /><br />Now comes the highlight of the film, the one and only KEVIN JAMES. What can one say about this brilliant preformance. Why dosn't this man make some more movies in his off time from his excellent show "KING OF QUEENS". Kevin's preformance is so good, so brilliant, so belivable it is nothing short of a classic preformance. His nice guy shy role fits him perfectlly, so much so that when he isn't on screen you are left waiting and wanting more of Mr James. Most of the films best moments happen because of him, the ending is a perfect example, or his early dance scene with Will.<br /><br />Which brings me to the on screen chemestry of these two brilliant preformers. When both are on screen you will laugh with out a doubt. After the film is over you might be left wanting to see more of them together again on the big screen. The chemestry between the two is amazing, no team I can remember has done so well together since Samual & John on "PULP FICTION". I'am sure there have been other great teams like Farley & spade in "TOMMEY BOY", but none have done so in the recent onslaught of terrible movies to come out lately.<br /><br />Thankfully this film is a gem in the film industry, and I can't wait to own it on dvd when it is released.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>This is one of the few movies I had to see in the theatre twice.

Will Smith and Kevin James who is one of my favorite comedians are great in this movie.  Very funny and is a perfect date movie to take your girlfriend or wife which I did take my girlfriend, her cousin, and her cousins boyfriend to see.  She liked it, I liked it, her cousin liked it, and her cousin's boyfriend liked it.  Eva Mendes, Amber Valletta, and Julie Ann Emery are hot.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>I generally don't like formula movies. "Hitch" is a comedy based on a formula going back decades and decades - boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl. Yawn! But Will Smith is such a great actor that he's able to take a stale script and turn this movie into something quite enjoyable. Add to his performance a great comedic turn by Kevin James, and you've got one very predictable but very funny movie.<br /><br />Smith plays Hitch, A New York City matchmaker. Gauging from his lifestyle, he's a success. His latest client is a big, goofy guy [James], who's secretly in love with a beautiful heiress. Hitch grooms the guy in all the right moves. Meanwhile, Hitch meets a girl [Eva Mendes] who will turn his life upside down.<br /><br />The plot is absurd. It's the performances that make this movie work. Smith and James make it something both touching and loud out loud funny.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`Hitch' is an above average romantic comedy which has some genuinely funny laugh out loud moments and plenty of Will Smiths charm and humour. Smiths character, Hitch, is a dating consultant who, whilst easing the path of many geeky men in their own lovelives, has trouble wooing the lady he is interested in himself. This makes for many funny scenes where he coaches his clients to be suave and sophisticated on the one hand and then watching him royally mess things up on the other. The scene where Hitch has an allergic reaction to shellfish is especially funny and Smith carries it off with style. This isn't an amazing Hollywood blockbuster, or trying to be some deep meaningful art piece, it is a simple fun romantic comedy and as that is all it's trying to achieve, it carries it off well. Worth a look on a lazy Sunday afternoon or to rent on a quiet date night in.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>**1/2<br /><br />In "Hitch," Will Smith plays a modern-day Henry Higgins, who, for a tidy fee, will teach lessons of love to a bunch of lovelorn Eliza Doolittles - only, in this case, the Elizas are grown men who desperately need instruction on how to win the hearts and affections of the women of their dreams. Of course, the irony is that Hitch doesn't adhere to his own formula, being a confirmed bachelor with no interest in entering into a serious relationship with anyone himself. Until, that is, he meets the woman of his own dreams, Sara, a New York City gossip columnist who has no idea what it is Hitch does for a living.<br /><br />It occurs to me that, when it comes to certain movie genres - action movies and romantic comedies in particular - it would be helpful if we could inflict some kind of temporary amnesia on ourselves so that we could at least think we were watching something new and fresh and not something we've already seen a hundred times before. Even the best romantic comedies can't entirely avoid paying homage to "the formula," and "Hitch" is clearly no exception. As such, the film has some mildly amusing moments, some endearingly sweet scenes, and some cute little plot complications amidst all the sentimental clich&eacute;s, lowbrow slapstick and tired stereotypes we generally find in these films. (I mean, do we really need yet another romantic comedy in which one of the heroine's co-worker sidekicks is a light-in-the-loafers, preposterously effeminate gay man?). It seems like every time "Hitch" is about to win us over, it short circuits itself and loses us by going for the obvious.<br /><br />Smith makes for a smooth romantic lead, but Eva Mendes doesn't always seem up to the challenge of her role, particularly when she is called upon to convey dramatic intensity. Actually, of the performers, it is Kevin James ("King of Queens"), as an overweight klutz who has hired Hitch's services to help him woo a beautiful blond heiress, who walks off with the film. Even though he's only a supporting player, it doesn't take him long to assume center stage in the film, essentially relegating the leads to second banana status.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>Until the final ten minutes of HITCH, this was one of the best romantic comedies I had seen in a long time.  The premise was fairly original, though in a way an inversion of the Cyrano de Bergerac theme.  The difference here is that instead of an ugly man capable of great love who gives voice to a less deserving, but handsome surrogate, Will Smith's Hitch is a man who is afraid of love enabling somewhat unattractive men who are capable of a great love, an opportunity to express it.  Hitch is a date doctor, someone who corrects the errors in a person's dating style that prevents his meeting the woman of his dreams.  The film revolves around two poles:  Hitch's efforts to help the hapless Albert--an overweight, clumsy accountant with bad taste and music and a hopeless dance style--woo the woman of his dreams, the socialite and heiress Allegra Cole on the one hand, and Hitch's own attempts to get to know (but not to love) Sara, a gossip columnist.  I like the way the two story lines intersect and complicate one another, so that at the end of the film Hitch ends up with not one but two disasters to correct.  Like in so many romantic comedies, the way to true happiness is paved with misunderstandings, and this is no exception.  My only problem with the movie is the way Hitch takes care of his own problems at the end of the film.  The person I saw this with hated the ending even more than I did, and she was quite upset that Sara had not taken what she considered to be the minimal steps that should have been expected for Hitch to be able to forgive her before trying to win her back.  I didn't hate the ending as much as she did, but I do agree that the final ten minutes of the film are much, much weaker than the rest of it.  On an intellectual level I understand why the decided to portray Hitch as temporarily bumbling and inarticulate, but I just couldn't buy the particular way that they pulled it off.<br /><br />How nice to see Will Smith in a romantic role!  And how refreshing to see Hollywood present an interracial relationship!  Granted, Eva Mendes is a dark complexioned Hispanic of Cuban descent, but it is one of the very few times we've ever seen a romance between an African American and a person of European descent.  Interracial relationships are common today, so it is nice to see Hollywood stop pretending that they don't occur.  Smith has never been funnier than in this one, and the scene in which he suffers an allergic reaction to shellfish is about as funny as I have seen in a while (the make up is exceptional in that scene).  Eva Mendes I had only scene previously in a film I absolutely detest, TRAINING DAY (as Denzel Washington's wife) and in the mess that was ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO.  She is much better served in this film, and she acquits herself admirably.  She has a feistiness and projects a confidence that I really like.  Kevin James is a stitch as Albert, and reveals himself to be one of the more physically graceful large actors to appear in some time.  Model Amber Valletta is fine as Allegra, the object of Albert's affections, but since she is quite attractive in an arm-trophy sort of way, she was perfect for the role.  Special mention must be made of Jerry Donovan, who is excellent as the reptilian Vance, who wants to hire Hitch to help him "bang" a girl he had met (Sara's best friend) so that he could forget about her and move on.<br /><br />I will confess that my own personal favorite type of film from the birth of the sound film to the present is the romantic comedy.  I wish as much effort was expended in the making of romantic comedies as in the production of movies based on comic book heroes or remakes of classics or TV shows.  That day may never come, but in the meantime I will be happy to see the occasional excellent representative of the genre such as HITCH.</p></br><a href="../users/A33IZJVCKFKDPU.html">A33IZJVCKFKDPU</a><br/><p>I cannot believe that Will Smith had never done a romantic comedy before "Hitch".  He has so much charisma that it would seem that he would have done about 10 of these type of movies by now.  But as it turns out, his first one "Hitch" is not bad and Will gets a little help from his co-star Kevin James.<br /><br />"Hitch" is a man named Alex Hitchins (Will Smith).  He is a "date doctor," meaning he helps pathetic guys to get really hot chicks that they would normally would not be able to get.  He has helped many men, and then comes Albert (Kevin James).  Albert is basically the type of guy that spills everything, says the wrong thing every time or does not have the nerve to say anything at all.  Albert wants to be able to get the movie star Allegra Coles.  So Hitch helps him and along the way he meets Sara Meles (Eva Mendes).  He falls for this girl and forgets everything that he teaches all of his clients by making a complete fool of himself.  Obviously thats where the humor comes in and then the dramtic climax of whether Hitch gets the girl or not.<br /><br />Will Smith does a great job as this character.  As mentioned earlier, his on-screen charisma makes him the perfect choice for this character.  The person that steals this movie from him is Kevin James.  Being a big "King of Queens" fan, he is the reason that I saw this movie and he did not disappoint.  Most of the movie's big laughs came from his antics.  I didn't really like Eva Mende's character.  She was too much of a pain in the neck (to put it nicely).<br /><br />This movie would be definately worth the watch, especially if you have a significant other to view it with.  It is funny and romantic, but I wouldn't say that its a chick flick.  So there you go guys, this one is okay to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>Will Smith is a cute, funny, and charismatic actor who has charm to spare. It is, therefore, surprising that Hollywood has never before cast him as the lead in a  romantic comedy. I doubt that this oversight will occur again, as Mr. Smith takes to the genre like a duck takes to water and makes it his own. His seemingly effortless, laidback style of acting strikes pay dirt as the romantic lead in this film. I am sure that Hollywood has now taken notice that Will Smith has what it takes to be the lead in a romantic comedy.<br /><br />Will Smith is cast in the role of Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, a young, suave, successful, sophisticated, smooth talker who has devised a career out of his ability to show even the most clumsy and shy, geeky guy how to get hitched to the woman of his dreams. He takes on clients whom he then  coaches in the mysteries of finding one's way into the heart of a beloved, but seemingly unattainable, woman.<br /><br />Our erstwhile dating consultant is hired by Albert (Kevin James),  a chubby, earnest, tongue-tied accountant, who has fallen for one of his firm's own clients, socialite-heiress Allegra Cole (Amber Valleta). She is a trophy type of woman who, one would think, would not even given Albert a second look. Under Hitch's careful coaching, however, even our unlikely, lovesick accountant seems to be on the road to  true love.<br /><br />Of course, them that can, do, while them that can't, coach, and Hitch is no exception. While he can successfully coach his clients to attain the love of their lives, Hitch runs into a whole host of problems in his life when dealing with his own romance. It appears that he has fallen for the gorgeous Sara (Eva Mendes), a local gossip columnist. Despite his ability to ensure that the path of true love runs smoothly for others, he himself runs into many roadblocks and bumps in the road.<br /><br />Will Smith is simply terrific in the role of "Hitch", playing the role with insouciant charm. His likeability quotient can't get much higher, and he certainly infuses the role with his effortless charm and humor. Hollywood would be remiss in not casting Will Smith in other romantic comedies, as he is such an ingratiating performer that the viewer cannot help but fall in love with him.  As his love interest, Eva Mendes is certainly a gorgeous leading lady, although her character is not always likable. Still, she makes the most of her role as the feisty Sara, and I look forward to seeing her in more films.<br /><br />I totally enjoyed seeing Kevin James in the film. He is the star of the long-running, hit television series, "The King of Queens", a show that I love and wish would run forever.  I was not disappointed by his transition to the big screen, as I really enjoyed his performance. He is simply a big, cuddly, teddy bear sort of guy that you can't help but love, which helps make his on-screen pairing with Amber Valleta believable. They are simply adorable together. Amber Valleta  successfully infuses her character, Allegra Cole,  with a certain vulnerability that makes her very likable.<br /><br />Kudos also go to director, Andy Tennant, whose deft direction contributes to the success of this film. This is a well-written, well-acted romantic comedy that is highly enjoyable. Co-stars Will Smith and Kevin James have great chemistry in the film and are excellent foils for each other. I would love to see them paired together in a buddy movie, as I think that they would be sensational.  Fans of romantic comedies, however, would be well-advised to see this film. They will be glad that they did.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Okay - I'm a guy who likes Will Smith in comedies and action films.  I love to share a good romantic comedy with the Mrs. but unfortunately WAY too many romantic comedies are not good.  I saw the ads for "Hitch" back when it came into the theatres and what I saw didn't make me want to see it.<br /><br />The Mrs. rented it last night, and we're both glad!  Will Smith plays the title character, a high-priced consultant who turns romantic, but unskilled men into objects of desire.  An opening montage shows hapless klutzes scoring with babes and we buy that "Hitch" must be good at his job.  Eva Mendez is the saucy Sara, a gossip columnist who is so busy and successful at her job that she hasn't thought about romance for years.  Kevin James meets Smith's comic chops every step along the way as the chubby bumbling accountant Albert who secretly pines for his high-profile client, zillionaire heiress Allegra Cole.<br /><br />For a movie like this to work, there has to be a generous and believable dose of "heart" and "Hitch" has it.  The central conflict in the movie comes from the perception about the mysterious "Date Doctor" Hitch.  The actual character has professional morals and ethics.  He doesn't train his clients to deceive their objets d'amour, he just "gives them opportunity".  We meet a jerk early in the film who hires Hitch to get tricks to bed women.  How Hitch sidesteps the guy is the right mixture of heart and machismo.  Wouldn't you know that "Mr. Wrong" later goes out with the best friend of Hitch's romance Sara?  Certainly it makes sense that Sara the gossip columnist would be tracking every move made by Paris Hilton surrogate Allegra.  It even makes sense to question why beautiful Allegra is being seen about town with dumpy Albert.<br /><br />The movie is not perfect.  But there were some honest belly laughs, and more thought than usual into the wittier than usual script.  The Mrs. and I give 2 thumbs up!</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>This was surprisingly good. I generally don't like romances.

The biggest downfall for me in Hitch was that most of the movie's funnier moments were completely squandered by the previews (which is nothing to new in movies these days). This includes the food allergy scene, the scene were Al and Hitch kiss, and the scene where Al shows off his less than decent hip-hop dance moves to Hitch. I'm pretty sure I would have found these parts a little more amusing if I hadn't seen them in the previews on television a hundred times. But then again, movie studios aren't too worried about giving away too much in a trailer, they just need to get you into the theater and that's all they are really worried about.<br />Also, it seemed to me in the last half hour or so, the film really lost where it was trying to go. There were a lot of other things going on plot-wise with a few different characters that made the film seem like it was trying to juggle too many things at once and having a hard time keeping pace with all of them.<br />Other than that, the movie was just okay. There were some other scenes that were worth a chuckle or two. Probably would make a good date movie for most couples.

Will Smith was just great, but I didn't expect anything less.<br /><br />An enjoyable and refreshingly charming and funny movie. I'm just completely tired of movies that are requires the people in there to act totally stupid in order to make the audience laugh. There's good laughing and then there's just... "what the hell?" kind of laughing.<br /><br />They could have made the ending better, end it with a big bang, but I guess they didn't but oh well. Watch this movie, its worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>First off, this movie is just great.  My wife and I watched this for the second time last night (first was in the theater) and we had forgotten how great this movie really was.  The chemestry between all the charactors is perfect.  Will and Kevin have real presence together, but the scene stealer is always Kevin James.  He just has a way of making you laugh at EVERYTHING.  He's the reason 'King of Queens' is one of my favorite shows (next to 'Yes, Dear')  Anyways, 'Hitch' revolves around Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens (Smith) who is a dating consultant for men who want to sweep the woman of their dreams off their feet.  His next job is poor Albert (James) who is in love with Alegra Cole, some rich high society sociallite, kinda like a soffisticated Paris Hilton.  So he enlists Hitch to help him get the girl.  And it works.  Now the real story here lies with Hitch falling in love with Sarah (Mendez) who is a gossip collumist who believes that the 'Date Doctor' is just an urban myth.  The problem with Hitch is that his own medicine doesn't seem to work on him and he just seems to screw everything up with the girl.  The great thing about this movie is that no matter who your watching your going to be laughing.  The movie as a whole is just really entertaining and very well put together.  Will Smith is always a good actor, very funny and he has that charm that makes you watch him.  But, as good as Smith is here he lacks that 'everyman' quality that makes Kevin the highlight of the film.  Watch this movie with that special someone, it's the perfect date movie and is a movie you can recommend to pretty much EVERYONE.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9.html">A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9</a><br/><p>Come on Willard!

Most of the funny scenes are the ones you see in the previews and the funniest of them all is the second dance scene that happens right before the end credits. This is a great date film that most guys will enjoy too.

It is both less and more than that. The more I thought about the stupid, by-the-numbers script, the more I loathed it. But the extraordinary charm of the three lead actors make up for a great deal, if not for everything. Will Smith is the obvious reason why people are flocking to this film, and he's a better reason than usual for a movie like this. If there's ever been a black Cary Grant, then certainly it's Smith, with his smooth, airy yet masculine charm and seemingly effortless gift for comedy. He and his leading lady, Eva Mendes, have loads of sexy chemistry together, while as one of Smith's "Date Doctor" clients, Kevin James is the most lovable cinematic overweight slob since the late John Candy. (As a real-life overweight slob, I salute him.) But the script--OUCH! I cite only the most egregious example of its lameness and imbecility: toward the end of the movie, Mendes--jumping to conclusions on the flimsiest of evidence--takes actions that cause nearly irreparable harm not only to Smith, but also to James, whom she's never even met. Later on, she tells Smith, "I never meant to hurt you." Bullhockey! She obviously meant not only to hurt him, but to destroy both him and James utterly. Yet the mechanics of the script demand that we take her apology at face value and regard Smith as a big old meanie because he doesn't. In the absence of evidence that the scriptwriters actually thought Mendes' behavior was justifiable, I can only assume they wanted to create the obligatory complications toward Smith and Mendes getting together, and were either too lazy or too dumb to create good ones. So this movie gets three stars--one each for Smith, Mendes, and James--and absolutely none for the script.</p></br><a href="../users/A36HBE2C5SQ2E6.html">A36HBE2C5SQ2E6</a><br/><p>Hitch(Will Smith) helps guys that have trouble with women, He helps them get their footing, and ask out the women by helping them do what they like. He also does this because he was rejected by a woman in college, and doesn't want to see that happen to them. He helps out a poor slob win over a rich heiress, and in the process, falls in love with a tabloid reporter. Then it all comes down on him, the tabolid reporter that he thought loved him sells him out and thinks that he is simply a "date hunter", that he hunts women for men to date.<br /><br />Will Smith was good in this, He was right for the part, and He had the feel for the character. I liked the way Eva Medes took her character and interacted with Will Smith. Kevin James makes a impressive first outing with movies, he is the most funny in the movie, and actually takes the joke and makes it funnier than it is. somehow, I felt the script was weak, I felt that some moments were forced, and some of the Humor was so fast that you didn't have time to think about the joke. I also felt that Will Smith was a little too confident in his role, and that he felt that he WAS the character, when I think that he could've taken situations and used his humor to make it funnier.<br /><br />The movie wasn't a masterpiece, I felt it was WAY better than some movies that have been released that call themselves "Romantic Comedies". I also felt that the Director was doing a good job but.... He could've gotten better performances by everybody. The writers needed to write something original, and instead of the cliches', they could've actually formed a decent romantic movie. I am not saying I didn't like it, I felt it was a very good movie but it has its flaws.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>"Hitch" is a romantic comedy that has many enjoyable moments, some good laughs, and stops just short of being a chick flick.  Will Smith has a wonderful screen presence as Hitch (Alex Hitchens) who has a private consulting practice of helping feckless men pull things together enough to get a shot at the woman of their dreams.  Not in a predatory way, but because they are men who like women and have what passes today for honorable intentions.  However, because his practice is so confidential there are certain rumors that surface that ascribe all kinds of malevolent power to the "date doctor".<br /><br />Kevin James is terrific as Albert, one of Hitch's biggest challenges.  Albert is in love with a celebrity far out of his league, Allegra Cole (named after an allergy medicine?) played with humanity and worldly knowing by Amber Valleta.

It's not that funny, it's not that original, and it's not nearly as good as I would expect from Will Smith.  The only good thing I can say about this film is Kevin James was great.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>"Hitch" (Will Smith) is a professional date doctor. He helps men get through the nervousness they experience when they are pursuing the woman of their dreams. His latest client, Albert (Kevin James, TV's "The King of Queens"), a portly CPA, is smitten with Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), an heiress whose every romance is plastered across the tabloids. Hitch agrees to take Albert on as a client, because he likes the challenge. Also pursuing Allegra Cole is Sara (Eva Mendes), the star reporter for one of those tabloids. Hitch spots her in a crowded bar one night and strikes up a conversation. Hitch and Sara's dates are disasters, but they agree to keep trying. As Albert becomes closer to Allegra, Hitch is still trying to pursue Sara, as she tries to pursue the elusive Albert.<br /><br />"Hitch", released rather fortuitously the Friday before Valentine's Day, broke a number of box office records it's opening weekend. This shouldn't be a surprise. Everything about the film is designed to make women go `aaaah, Will Smith is so cute.'<br /><br />The film is a pleasant diversion, but it only works sporadically. The film is at it's best when the story centers on Albert, the Kevin James character. He has a couple of scenes of inspired comedy, which surely must have been adlibbed. One scene, in which he demonstrates to Hitch how he would dance is the funniest thing I have seen in some time. Another nice touch to Albert's character is that although he is portly, this isn't necessarily the cause of his nervousness. He's just nervous around women. It doesn't help that he is pursuing one of the most beautiful socialites in New York, but it's nice to see a big guy portrayed in a film that isn't a slob or completely useless.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is also the part of the film that concentrates on Hitch's relationship with Sara. I guess the filmmakers felt that they needed something a little more grounded to balance out the film. Smith and Mendes are certainly likable enough as actors, and their first date is slightly amusing. But this is the relationship in the film where nothing works. They get in fights, have miscommunication, have bad feelings, in others words, like a real life courtship. I'm sorry, but I don't want to see Will Smith, in a comedy, in a relationship attempting to be real life. It brings the entire film down. This story line might have been more successful but there is also a lack of chemistry between them. They don't kiss until the end, and by that point, we have sat through about 60 minutes of this. It's too little, too late.<br /><br />The funniest bit with Smith is the very beginning of the film as we eavesdrop on him working with three clients. Its fun to watch how he helps them win the ladies of their dreams.<br /><br />The technical aspect of the film is okay. The fairly straight forward approach works for the story. Everyone lives in a great apartment in New York City, enjoys going out all the time and are basically burning up the town. They must all make a lot of money. What "Hitch" does well is provide a very nice portrait of New York City. It looks like a fun place to live.<br /><br />Too bad the film doesn't provide as much enjoyment as living in New York seems to for these characters.</p></br><a href="../users/AWJOVW1BZZ34H.html">AWJOVW1BZZ34H</a><br/><p>A "date doctor" helps a loser get the girl, but can't help himself get one. Kevin James steals the show in this one, if you like King of Queens check it out, he plays the same character with a different name.<br /><br />I thought all the "deep advice" on how to get a woman was kind of funny and over the top some of the time. I hope no young men out there buy this movie so they can learn how to pick up women. I can help them with that.<br /><br />To get a woman follow three steps:<br /><br />1) Buy a Ferrari<br /><br />2) Be seen in your Ferrari<br /><br />3) Enjoy all the women that you will spend time with.<br /><br />I give this movie 4 stars because it started a bit slow and was a bit too chick flick in spots. Plus, a bit of nudity would have helped.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Will Smith is the "Date Doctor", a man who knows everything about coaching other people towards romance.  He knows all of the angles and he shares them with male clients who are in love and feel that the object of their affection is out of their reach.  His main client is a klutzy accountant, played by Kevin James, who is in love with a wealthy divorcee.  Meanwhile Smith is using all of his romantic ploys to win over a gossip columnist, played by Eva Mendes.  It's a tossup as to who is the most leery about relationships, Smith or Mendes.  Each has been hurt before and each will do whatever it takes to avoid any further hurt.  This movie is full of laughs and, although the end is predictable, getting there is lots of fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>I knew he could do it. Will Smith is suave and sexy-- of course he can do a romantic comedy. Smith stars as Alex Hitchens, aka Hitch, the date doctor. He helps otherwise helpless guys find true love in only three dates. Hitch won't help just anybody. He's strictly off the radar and can only be found through referral. Hitch's clientel are men who want the real deal, not just a one night stand.<br /><br />The movie centers around Hitch and one of his clients named Albert (played by the hilarious Kevin James). Albert wants to date supermodel Allegra Cole. Hitch thinks this is crazy, but agrees to help, knowing how passionate Albert is about her. Meanwhile, Hitch meets a woman named Sara, who is a gossip columnist. This spells disaster already. Sara doesn't understand what Allegra Cole could possibly see in a dowdy, clutzy guy like Albert. Little does she know that the guy she's been seeing is the famed date doctor.<br /><br />It's a romantic comedy, so it's fairly predictable. But that doesn't make it any less fun. Will Smith is wonderful, come on, you knew he would be. Can't really expect less from Will Smith... we'll just forget about Wild Wild West... Kevin James is so funny; I couldn't believe how many times his Trying-To-Act-Cool-But-Being-A-Total-Clutz routine had me laughing out loud. This is such a fun movie, a great date movie... wow, I'd even say a perfect date movie. Maybe guys can pick up a few tips from Hitch. Then again, are there really any rules?! RECOMMENDED!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>On the surface the message of "Hitch" is you can't predict love. There are no rules, you just have to go out there and be yourself and if you do that you will find everyone has a special someone out there waiting to be found.<br /><br /> But I've seen this movie before and the most memorable example is the 1972 Herbert Ross film based on Woody Allen's stage play "Play It Again, Sam". In that movie Allen wants to be Humphrey Bogart, who is suppose to be the epitome of cool. Allen thinks if he can act more like somone else, and less like himself he will get the girl.<br /><br /> Fastforward, it's now 2005 and most people don't know who Humphrey Bogart is so they now look to Alex "Hitch" Hitchens (Will Smith) who is a "date doctor". He coaches men on how to be cool. He tells them all the rules of dating.<br /><br /> I wonder though if underneath the surface there is another message being sent out. Will Smith is an African-American actor who has a great amount of box-office success. Maybe he wasn't chosen for the part merely because of his appeal. In our society we tend to think the black culture is also the epitome of cool. Only black men can act suave and sweep the ladies off their feet. Only they know how to dress or dance whereas white men are seen as nerds. Notice how nearly all of Hitch's clients are white males. I realize I'm thinking outside the box here, but don't be so quick to dismiss the casting decisions made in this movie. I realize Hollywood at times seems as if it doesn't have a brain but just think about it the images you are seeing and what exactly they mean in relation to society.<br /><br /> But most people who watch this movie may not even think about it terms of its social ramification so lets talk about it as if it had no hidden agenda.<br /><br /> Alex Hitchens was not always the "date doctor" as a flashback shows us. In college he was quite unpopular until one day he fell in love with Cressida (Robinne Lee). He thought she was the love of his life and he made sure to repeatedly tell her he loves her to which she would appear uncomfortable. Alex then catches Cressida cheating on him, breaking his heart. He now vows he will never have another man go through what he did again. So he decides he will help men get the women of their dreams.<br /><br /> Albert (Kevin James) is an accountant who is in love with Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), one of the clients his firm handles. She doesn't even know he exist and so he seeks out Hitch.<br /><br /> Hitch thinks Albert his hopeless but sticking true to his vow agrees to help him out anyway. Albert though does nothing but stumble over things and knock things over. But I just found it annoying. Sure Woody Allen has made a career out of it, but I've never heard, even from Allen's critics, somone describe what he does as predictable and juvenile. I can not say the same thing for Kevin James.<br /><br /> Now while Hitch is helping Albert get the girl of his dreams, Hitch meets a gossip columnist Sara (Eva Mendes). Sara is shown as a cold bitter person who has some issues, that sadly are never fully explored in this movie, and seems to have sworn off men. She claims they always disappoint her. We soon realize she was just waiting for Hitch to come along. But when Hitch is with her he doesn't seem to be playing his game right. He stumbles, says the wrong thing, and even gets food poisoning.<br /><br /> The movie then becomes a guessing game of whether or not Albert will get Allegra in the end? Will Allegra find out about Hitch? Will Hitch get Sara and will she ever find out about who he really is?<br /><br /> If you're over five who should be able to guess the answers to these questions and that's pretty much the problem with this movie. Everythng happens exactly the way it is suppose to happens. Nothing new or different is done here. It strickly follows the formula of movies before it. And I thought it was all done without any big laughs.<br /><br /> Now a movie like "Hitch" I guess is pretty hard to actually hate it. I didn't have a bad physical reaction to it but I don't think I would want to watch it again. It is not a great movie and quite frankly I'm surprised at the reaction this movie is getting on Amazon. But this movie is not worth your time.<br /><br /> Okay, so if by some small miricle I've convinced you not to see this movie you're asking yourself then what should I go out and see. Well in theaters there is Paul Haggis' "Crash", and if you like animation, and even if you don't, please, please, please go see "Howl's Moving Castle" and I also recommend "Cinderella Man" and the new "Star Wars" movie. On DVD you have Sean Penn giving one of his best performances in "The Assassination of Richard Nixon" and Kevin Bacon in "The Woodsman" and on a lighter note the Alain Renais French musical\comedy "Not on the Lips".<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Disappointing formula driven romantic\comedy that just isn't all that funny. Kevin James starts to get a bit annoying and the movie just bails on Eva Mendes as it leads us to think there is some secret about her past and a particular man that may have hurt her.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>Will Smith (Bad Boys 1 and 2, Wild Wild West) stars as Kevin Hitchinson but call him Hitch and he is a date doctor who hooks up desperate men to the women they have feelings for. Kevin James (Tv's King Of Queens) plays Albert Brenneman, a buisnessman who works for the woman for who he loves and shes a big star and shes on the cover on gossip magazines. James goes to Smith for help and Smith takes him under his wing telling the ways he has to get her attention and James succeds as he starts to become her new "man". Smith on the otherside falls for reporter Eva Mendes (Stuck On You, Training Day), who is sorta miscast, and they soon hit if off going on dates. It's a good Romantic Comedy but I dont think Mendes is the right one for Smith. Kevin James is great and Smith redeems himself from the rubble that was I, Robot last year. Also starring Jeffrey Donovan (Book Of Shadows: Blair Witch 2, Bait). Better then most of the crappy comedies out there.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>From the Scene One in which Will Smith with his easygoing charms directly talks to us viewers, we know where the film is going.  Will Smith is Alex Hitchens, "date doctor" who gives tips for males to arrange the dates with the opposite sex.  And believe it or not, every "client" is satisfied with his job.<br /><br />The film has two stories, both of which are not particularly original, but told with a delightful touch and considerable energy.  In one, Alex himself falls in love with a gossip columnist Sara (Eva Mendes), who strictly guards herself against unwelcome males coming to her.  But of course, Alex is an exception -- his persistent wooing (even using walkie-talkie)is so irreisitible.<br /><br />In the other, we find more unique story and talents -- Alex is given a hard task, as hard as Mission Impossible.  That is, to guide one accountant Albert (Kevin James) successfully to his goal -- a date with a celebrity, beautiful and (very) rich female Allegra (Amber Valletta).  The big problem is, Albert, so smitten, so good-natured, so timid, cannot do one single right thing even while having a lunch, kind of a guy who drops fried potatoes onto the floor, and kicks a can of coke while picking up them.  It seems Albert (and a terrible dancer too) is totally a hopeless case, but Alex Hitchens knows what to do.<br /><br />The direction of Andy Tennant ('Ever After') is a strange mixture of slapsticks, witty dialogues, and romantic mood.  The tone is inconsistent, but that doesn't bother us.  The story is predictable, and the ending is very weak, but still the characters, or the actors, are all charming.  And very funny and likable Kevin James as Albert steals almost every scene in the film.<br /><br />Probably, however, the best part of the film is the location itself, well-chosen spots in New York City.  A bit familiar as romantic comedy perhaps, but very cute 'Hitch' with equally cute characters reminds us that this city is and will be a beloved place for every film lover.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Hitch is a feel good movie that'd be a safe bet to watch on a first date.

He suggest them that under no circumstance they must allow his real will emerges, creating a stereotyped model without loosing spontaneity, but you know how it is; he will live in new flesh the sum of his contradictions, falling down twice in his raising date, and forgetting that the love is much wiser than we pretend to know because the imagination and the taste is such elusive and subjective matter that many successful accidents will work out as the real hook to find his expected love.<br />Funny, original and smart entertaining film that links with that Trufautt ' s lovely film "The man who loved women" and showing that the author cinema is coming back, fortunately in USA, because the creative process has been growing in the last decade, at short steps, if you want but that means something.

The trailers did not do this film justice. Will Smith is HITCH the "Date Doctor" for males who just want to get the girl of their dreams as is the case with Kevin James. Others clients are not so noble of heart. In the mean time HITCH is also trying to get the girl of his dreams. I liked this film immensely because the script is well thought out and the bottom line here is that these guys envision the girl of their dreams as someone they want to be with and love for the rest of their lives. HITCH's intentions are based on good old fashioned notions of what it means for a man to love a women and the commitment that goes with that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5VLIJMDPWHI.html">A2C5VLIJMDPWHI</a><br/><p>This movie was unrealistic in some parts (who buys someone something as expensive as scuba gear on a first date or lets a person come to THEIR house after they have an allergy attack) but other than that, the movie was unstoppable. It was hilarious, it was a realistic view at the dating scene (minus the above antics), and Will Smith carried this movie all the way through.  I enjoy any movie he's in, to be honest with you. But I don't think the movie would've been good without him.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Typically when I'm choosing a movie to watch in my spare time, I will choose from action, drama, comedy, sci-fi, thrillers, etc. (what you would basically expect from any guy), I can honestly say that I very rarely choose a romantic comedy, and never a musical. However, sometimes a romantic comedy comes along that looks interesting and funny to me, generally because the premise is different from most or because I like the stars in it, or simply because my wife chooses the movie for our movie night. In the case of "Hitch" it was a combination of the first 2 factors, but for some reason my wife and I never got around to watching this movie in theaters, and for the longest time on DVD. But recently, we sat down and watched it, and I must say that even though many critics and some moviegoers weren't entertained that much by the movie, I found it to be highly enjoyable and one of the better romantic comedies I had seen.<br /><br />"Hitch" is the story of Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens (Will Smith), a man whose job is to find ways for a man to successfully woo the woman of his choice into a successful dating relationship. Hitch is a man that is good at his job, but never really finds the time for his own dating life. When Hitch begins coaching a pudgy accountant (Kevin James) on how to get noticed by an attractive, wealthy heiress, his own love life begins to blossom, but through a series of mishaps starts to go horribly awry. Inevitably leaving Hitch wondering why he can make love happen for complete strangers but never for himself. But before he can figure out what's going on in his life, a newsreporter (Eva Mendes) is trying to uncover the true identity of this so-called 'Date Doctor', and after protecting his identity for so long Hitch finds himself in the media crosshairs, and the real kicker is, it's his new girlfriend that put him there.<br /><br />As far as romantic comedies go, most of them are generally predictable to some extent, sometimes the predictability of these types of films lends to boredom for me. However, there are a few romantic comedies that manage to be predictable, yet still entertain, and then there are the few (very few) that just surprise you by not being all that predictable. "Hitch" falls somewhere between somewhat predictable and not all that much, there are the typical romantic comedy elements that are crucial for this type of film. For example, guy finds girl, impresses girl, things get serious, some secret about guy is discovered by girl, girl breaks up with guy, guy proclaims love for girl, and all is well with the world - those are your basic elements (give or take one or two) to almost every romantic comedy these days, and "Hitch" contains several of them. The difference for me was that unlike a lot of other romantic comedies where the story is so thin and the humor is virtually non-existent that you find yourself already knowing how the movie will end and checking your eyelids for holes within the first 30 minutes due to boredom, "Hitch" keeps things going at a very steady pace with plenty of laughs and clever dialogue that I never got distracted by getting ahead of the story, and remained entertained throughout. Probably the element I enjoyed the most of the movie was the way the character of Hitch had taken a by-the-book approach to dating, as far as his tips go, that worked like a charm for every guy that he tutored, yet could never get the same approach to work for him, and in the end he discovers that love, much like life, isn't always so simply figured out.<br /><br />The performances by the cast were uniformly strong, Will Smith and Kevin James out-shined everyone, which wasn't really all that surprising given their comedic and acting talents. Eva Mendes was very endearing as the woman that Hitch is trying to start a relationship with, and she shows a great on-screen chemistry with Will Smith that made their couple very believable. The story as I said earlier contained many of the familiar elements of most romantic comedies, yet still entertained me, and I never felt like I'd seen it all before. The ending is what you expect, and of course hope for in this type of movie, but the execution of the ending was done in a very interesting and unique way that I didn't expect, probably making it a much more enjoyable ending than most.<br /><br />With all of that being said, "Hitch" isn't the most original romantic comedy, but there are numerous elements that are unique, and allowed me to overlook the same old elements that are so tried and true to this genre. It was a very entertaining movie, that provides you plenty of laughter and leaves you feeling good, which is what these movies should do.<br /><br />"Hitch" is rated PG-13 for language and sensuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FBIF1FKBC193.html">A2FBIF1FKBC193</a><br/><p>Ok so you are probably wondering what I thought of this move ... I know I know .... don't hold back ...<br /><br />This is a great story and the perfect vehicle for Will Smith to play the cool and world smart tutor for men who have no hope in the world of ever developing a relationship with a woman. Needless to say when he meets up with a hard as nails local gossip reporter all of his professional skils are tested to the limit ......<br /><br />This is definitely a 'date' movie or one could say a 'chick flick' but trust me it's a hoot and the viewer never really knows wher in the world the story is going ...<br /><br />It certainly has been a long time since I thoroughly enjoyed a great story, great movien and great acting ....</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>The grand irony of "Hitch" is that it talks the talk but in the end does not walk the walk.  The best part of this 2005 romantic comedy happen when the title character, Alex Hitchens (Will Smith), a.k.a. the "Date Doctor," and his newest pupil, Albert Brennaman (Kevin James) are making an effort to impress the women with whom they are smitten.  Respectively, these ladies are Sara Melas (Eva Mendes), a smart but cynical gossip columnist for a New York City tabloid, and Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), a glamorous celebrity socialite.  Nobody can get past the cold exterior that Sara has built around herself and everybody, especially the rest of the NYC celebrity set wants a piece of Allegra.<br /><br />Hitch decides he is interested in Sara and his opening gambits in getting her to respond are brilliant.  The script by Kevin Bisch provides a hook (at the bar) and a line (at her office) that set up a literal sinker (on the water).  More importantly, Will Smith could not be more comfortable playing a character.  Hitch is charming and he is smart, and despite a couple of problems with this first "date," you have no trouble believing he is the "Date Doctor."  Albert is an accountant and in great need of Hitch's coaching, even to the point of needing advice whispered in his ear while having a face to face conversation with the woman he adores (try doing THAT Cyrano de Bergerac).  But when Albert first manages to get Allegra's attention, and when he manages to get her to attend a function and has to run the gauntlet of her friends, he proves himself up to the task, and the important thing is that although Hitch has set up objectives (e.g., "shock and awe"), it is Albert who comes up with the specifics.  James's performance is almost as good as Smith's, but take into consideration that his role is harder, because he has to be both the timid accountant who needs all the help in the world and the guy who has his own charming side when he has the confidence to make it work for him.<br /><br />The problem with "Hitch" is that once director Andy Tennant has shown us that the Date Doctor is effective, both for his clients as well as in his own behalf, he decides that that he has come not to praise Hitch but to bury him.  I disagree with this diagnosis.  Hitch is not a smooth operator, which is a bad thing (a.k.a. being a pig), Hitch is just flat out smooth (I never thought I would say this, but Will Smith could be the closest thing we have to a new Cary Grant).  He is not scheming to seduce Sara, he is interested in her and capable of playing the high stakes came it takes to get her to actually take a guy seriously.  Likewise, Albert is not faking.  He has a better understanding of what it is he needs to do and why, and he makes an earnest attempt to do what needs to be done.  Neither one of them is lying when they say what they say and there is certainly nothing wrong with trying to put your best foot forward.  For that matter, knowing what that means in all of its myriad forms is not a bad thing either when you are trying to impress the woman you love.<br /><br />But when Hitch has his big moment of revelation and says what the script thinks is his big line, THAT is when the character tells his first lie.  Because what he says is simply not true and the proof for it is so simple: If Hitch had never talked to Albert how far would our accounting nebbish have gotten with Allegra?  For that matter, what in all honesty could Hitch have done to impress Sara given the dazzling display that we say it took from him to get her to agree to go out in the first place?  However, before the big dramatic ending ruins "Hitch" this is a pretty good romantic comedy with lots of smart and funny scenes, so there will be a lot of people willing to enjoy it and gloss over the hypocrisy of the final act, especially with all that cool dancing during the end credits.  But I have rarely seen a film whose self-proclaimed moral so badly missed the lesson it spent one hour and forty-five minutes developing.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>A simplistic story about how "Hitch" (Will Smith) helps clueless clients make a good first impression. I was especially offended by the dominance of inter-racial dating - this was contrived, thrown in to have appeal to all segments of society to help make up for the lousy plot.</p></br><a href="../users/ADE852UR9121C.html">ADE852UR9121C</a><br/><p>This is one of the most overhyped movies out there. I admit, this movie started of strong, but after the 1st hour or so...it just spiralled downhill.<br /><br />It is about Alex Hitchens, this date doctor who basically helps big-hearted losers to get noticed by their dream girls. In his words, he creates the opportunity for them. One of these guys happens to be Albert who has a thing for Allegra, the rich and beautiful multi-millionaire. Meanwhile, Alex meets Sara who's a gossip columnist and sparks fly. What happens next? I'm sure anyone with a brain would know.<br /><br />I have nothing against romantic comedies. The thing with this kind of movies is the story. We all know how it's gonna end, so the writers should thrill us with the ride there. A good romantic comedy should evoke some kind of emotions. Unfortunately, even with the talented cast they have here, it's all gone to waste with a lousy and utterly predictable script. The starting 10-15 minutes was great, and I was actually looking forward to the movie. Then Will Smith gave me laughs when trying to woo Sara, played by sexy Eva Mendes. But other than this, there's nothing else that entertained me. And most of the funny scenes are actually in the movie trailer.<br /><br />Kevin James, who I really like in King Of Queens is underused here. And his chemistry with Allegra (played by Amber Valleta) seems kinda dead. He doesn't really seem that infatuated with her. Will Smith tries to salvage this movie for all he can, but there's just so much a guy can do. The second half of the movie really was pretty boring because of it's predictability and it seemed like I was watching a mixture of other romantic comedies (How to Lose A Guy in 10 Days and Notting Hill comes to mind).<br /><br />This movie might be good to watch with your partner, but even then...just rent it, it's not worth buying. This movie fails because of the script, the actors bring all they can to their roles but it just isn't enough. If you want good romantic comedies, get Hugh Grant's movies...they're predictable of course but you'll have a hell of a good time watching the story unfold.</p></br><a href="../users/A34IBXM7E8CPWE.html">A34IBXM7E8CPWE</a><br/><p>Using this simple formula you can tell just how bad a "chick flick" will be for a guy to have to sit through. Add together the number of 1960's R&B tunes (double the points if tunes are used in a wacky lip-synch routine by one of the cast, or if cast members suddenly start serenading star with a 1960's song). Mulitply the number of songs by the number of "gay comic relief" characters in the movie. The formula might look something like this: Otis Redding + Aretha Franklin + Marvin Gaye + Van Morrison x 3-Gay Comic Relief = Get the Hell Out of the Theater NOW!! If you score above 10 points with this formuala.....leave the theater immediately, run home, and pop in an emergency copy of "Die Hard" kept close at hand for just this situation. "Hitch" is 100% pure Chick-Flick, my bag of popcorn came with breasts!!! The ads for this movie focused only on the funny scenes with Kevin James, who is actually only in the film for about 20 minutes, the majority of movie really focuses around Will Smith trying to seduce the too manly and often scary lead actress!! The movie is long, boring, full of every romantic movie cliche, I think this story was actually an old plot line from "The Love Boat"...in short...I had a great time watching "Die Hard" last night.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>Get out! Stop! I mean it! This is so funny! His name is Alex Hitchens, they call him Hitch, and he helps people get hitched. Stop it! That is too clever! (Yikes).<br /><br />The best thing you can say about this formulaic twaddle is that it's inoffensive, which is precisely what makes it so awful. Hitch has UCLA film school screenplay written all over it, especially the knucklehead antics ensuing as doctor and client wrestle in parallel. Then comes the wildly unsurprising payout - Albert is really much more wise in the ways of love than Alex. Who saw that bombshell coming?<br /><br />What little joy there is to be milked from this ancient cow comes through the grace of lovely Allegra, Amber Valletta, and Albert, Kevin James. The character of Allegra is a preposterous concoction, but Ms. Valletta gives it authenticity, quite an achievement. As to Kevin James, this is one fine comic actor who seems completely natural and comfortable on camera. He is both gifted and skilled with a marvelous way of achieving the virtually impossible task of making comedy look easy. As far as Will Smith goes, well, it's not far enough.<br /><br />I wouldn't say Smith is incapable of acting, because I have seen him turn in credible performances. But, I would say that no one has cruised quite so effortlessly down the freeway for so long with so little gas in the tank. Frankly, Smith is likeable and non-threatening, his appeal rests in his good looks and the absolute certainty that he will never do or say anything remotely interesting or controversial.<br /><br />Let's not downplay the value provided here. In a tormented world, some folks want to take a date to the movies secure in the knowledge that every emotion they're about to experience has been reviewed and approved by the FDA. But I'm not three of them. Un-hitch the movie, I'll just watch the trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>While `Hitch' may not be the most original romantic comedy to hit the big screen it's one of the most enjoyable.  Will Smith is always entertaining and effortlessly captivating, but this time, with the pairing of the breathtaking beauty known as Eva Mendes and the hilarious Kevin James, Smith is brought to the top of his game.  The script is sweet and refreshing, the dialog is smart and funny and the acting is top notch.  Eva Mendes is not only beautiful but charming and funny.  She keeps proving with each role no matter how thankless that she is more than a pretty face.  This role is not thankless, thankfully, but just the same she's a star.  The real standout though is Kevin James who outdoes himself.  I've always loved James' standup and his show `The King of Queens' but here he really blows me away with his natural charm and humor.<br /><br />Smith plays Alex `Hitch' Hitchens, a date doctor as it were, who helps coach men into successful relationships.  His latest project is Albert, an overweight accountant who has fallen for the rich and beautiful Allegra Cole, a woman many may consider out of his league.  With Hitch's help Albert begins to woo Allegra and a mutual attraction between the two is formed.  In the meantime Hitch himself finds he's been struck by cupids arrow, falling for columnist Sara Meles, and soon we discover that Hitch is about as helpless as the men he coaches.  Between the two couples hilarity ensues and the audience is never left bored or wanting.<br /><br />As may well be expected events line themselves up to expose Hitch and his clientele and threaten to end both sets of blossoming relationships.  All is good though and the ride is a fun and entertaining one.  The chemistry between the entire cast is fantastic.  James feeds Albert enough charm and tenderheartedness that the audience falls in love with him alongside Allegra and Mendes plays Sara with enough sass and smarts that we can easily understand why Hitch is so absorbed in her.  Smith may be the star but with a cast this impressive he gladly shares the spotlight and the praise with his co-stars.  It's fun and breezy entertainment suitable for the entire family and will go down as one of my favorite romantic comedies of late.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Will Smith did a good job in his first romantic comedy, showing the screen presence that the viewers were expecting. He was definatly right for the part and had the feel for the character. I liked the way Eva Medes took her character and interacted with Will Smith. Kevin James makes an impressive first outing with movies, he is hilarious in the movie, and actually takes the joke and makes it funnier than it is. somehow, I felt the script was weak, I felt that some moments were forced, and some of the Humor was so fast that you didn't have time to think about the joke. Will Smith at times was a little too confident in his role, I think he felt that he WAS the character, when I think that he could've taken situations and used his humor to make it funnier.<br /><br />The movie wasn't a masterpiece but it is WAY better than some movies that have been released that call themselves "Romantic Comedies". Andy Tennant, Director, did a good job but.... could've gotten better performances by cast. The writers in the other hand needed to write something original, and instead of the clich&eacute;s'. There are definitely some silly scenes, which some aren't quite realistic, but the other are so true to life that it hits you square in the eyes. the things I appreciated the most about Hitch is that it is free of the overt sexual innuendos that are so common and accepted in most romantic comedies... it could almost be rated PG.<br />To sum it up it's a movie about a guy who helps guys get the girl of their dreams to fall in love. "Hitch" is great for (almost) all ages (due to little language) but it is worth having.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>In New York, Alex Hitchen is a kind of sentimental advisor, teaching each client how to date the woman of his dream. His present case is helping the clumsy Albert to date the wealthy and powerful Allegra Cole. Meanwhile, Hitch has a crush on the gossip columnist Sara, who was assigned to write about Allegra. When the best girlfriend of Sara has a love disillusion with a man that Sara thinks that is a client of Hitch, she plots a revenge against Hitch and the misunderstanding leads the two couples to a conflictive situation. From the opening credits to the closing, I was laughing all through. There is something in this movie for everyone.  The cast has great chemistry. This movie has comedy as well as a metaphor. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OH101U0CPUC7.html">A3OH101U0CPUC7</a><br/><p>Alex "Hitch" Hitchens (Will Smith) is the "date doctor" who helps men get to first base with the woman of their dreams. He isn't a sleaze who teaches them to lie and con their way forward, he helps build their confidence and form a plan so they don't look like fools. His latest challenge is Albert (Kevin James), a portly tax accountant who lusts after a glamorous heiress. While Hitch is coaching Albert in the toughest assignment of his career, he also pursues a reporter for a New York tabloid. As one might expect in a romantic comedy, misunderstandings ensue and both Hitch and Albert will have to struggle if they want to capture true love.<br /><br />Will Smith is one of the most likeable personas around and he exudes his usual easy charm here. The ethics of his profession had the potential to get dicey, but it's made very clear that he doesn't help guys score, he helps men looking for love. Just as most shrinks seem to be emotionally damaged, so too the love doctor is suffering the long-term effects of a broken heart. Hitch is charming and witty with a woman but letting her inside is a bit too scary. Albert is the opposite, of course. A big teddy bear who would declare his love for the heiress before she knew his name (with disastrous results) if he didn't have Hitch to advise him. The training sessions with the two of them are probably the most enjoyable of the whole movie and certainly enjoyable.<br /><br />If there was a downside to the movie, it was the character of Sara, Hitch's love interest. She is so judgmental and shrill that I found myself wishing that Hitch would find someone a lot more pleasant to pursue. Alas, the poor man was smitten and so can look forward to continued verbal maulings for quite some time.<br /><br />This is an easy movie to watch and an easy movie to like. Hitch is funny, entertaining, and has a good-hearted feel. Will Smith is as good as expected, but Kevin James plays a critical role in providing warmth and vulnerability in a movie that could otherwise have come off as slick and cynical.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Displaying that he can handle the lead role in a romantic comedy just as easily as he can handle every other genre in the field, Will Smith shines in HITCH as Alex Hitchens, aka "The Date Doctor."  Hitch helps average guys gain the attention and win the hearts of the women of their dreams.  He has a strict code that he follows and his identity has remained a secret.<br /><br />Hitch is hired by a tax accountant named Albert (Kevin James).  Albert is an overweight, average-Joe who happens to work at a firm that handles starlet Allegra Cole's (Amber Valleta) accounts.  Allegra Cole is a celebrity and has all the money, fame, power, and beauty that comes with her station.  Albert falls deeply in love with Ms. Cole and needs help getting her attention.  This is a romantic comedy, so even the most improbable scenarios become likely and soon Albert finds himself dating the famous Allegra Cole.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Hitch has some problems of his own.  He's fallen for a national gossip columnist, Sara (Eva Mendes) who is trying to figure out who the unknown man Allegra Cole has been seen with really is.  Hitch is a true genius at setting up scenarios for his clients, but all of the tricks he uses to help his clients have the opposite effect when he uses them with Sara.  For example, A romantic trip to Ellis Island turns Sara into a raging and crying fury of hatred and a night at a make-your-own seafood place has Hitch breaking out in a serious facial reaction.  As Hitch and Sara bond with each other, their relationship becomes increasingly rocky when a spurned client turns on Hitch and Sara learns what he really does for a living.<br /><br />The poster and DVD cover for HITCH say that "Will Smith is `Hitch'".  There's no better way to explain it because Smith is Hitch.  Every gesture, move, and spoken phrase seems perfect.  Hitch is a role that Smith was born to play.  But Smith doesn't shine alone in the film.  Eva Mendes is a beautiful woman, but she's also incredibly talented.  She holds her own against one of Hollywood's most powerful actors.  From various interviews she has given, Mendes seems like a down-to-Earth person.  That reality grounds Sara and radiates through her and makes her someone that the audience cares for.  Kevin James does an excellent job as the film's pivotal-plot character Albert and in many scenes upstages Smith.<br /><br />I tend to like most genres of movies as long as there is a good story involved.  However, romantic comedies are my least favorite film genre.  Many romantic comedies made are trite and have no originality to them.  HITCH really isn't like that.  The movie has a good story, great actors, and solid direction.  It's both funny and tender.  Unlike many movies in he genre, HITCH is a movie that a person can enjoy watching by themselves just as much as watching it with a loved one.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of romantic comedies, fans of Will Smith, fans of Eva Mendes, and fans of Kevin James.  For movie trivia fans, the fire station shown at the beginning of the movie as Hitch is helping a client is the same firehouse used in GHOSTBUSTERS.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HWD9PTM7RBXN.html">A2HWD9PTM7RBXN</a><br/><p>My feelings are good not great on this one.  Will Smith tries to play the dating doctor but it turns out that he needs some thereapy when he falls for a reporter.  Its all a matter of practicing what you preach.  Some good scenes where Smith's, knowledgeable but shy accountant speaks out especially when confronted with aristocratic snobs.  The speedating scene is amusing as well.  Howver, the movie is sluggish in spots.  Nonetheless the good outweighs the bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>I have to say I have always enjoyed Will Smith, but this is one of his best roles. A special romantic comedy that most couples will love. An excellent date movie. I think even kids will probably find parts of this amusing. His co-star Eva Mendes is not only beautiful, but does a wonderful performance as his romantic interest that very much has a mind of her own. Support roles by Kevin James and others are outstanding and make this an above par look at the rigors of dating. It covers all the bases of how to pick someone up without pickup lines to dancing without looking like a fool. If you enjoy the romantic movies without the fluff like "50 First Dates", you should like this one. This movie will make you laugh and cry. It genuinely touches the heart and funny bone. Great acting, script, locations, camera work, and music make this a keeper. Get it!</p></br><a href="../users/A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA.html">A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA</a><br/><p>Admittedly, I am not a big fan of "romantic comedies" but this was one of the better ones I've seen. I liked this much better than, for example, "Monster In Law" which had two big names in it in the form of Jennifer Lopez and Jane Fonda.<br /><br />Anyway, Will Smith does an excellent job as Hitch, a man dedicated to helping good but clueless men get the woman of their dreams. Along the way, he falls in love with a gossip columnist named Sara (Eva Mendes) who discovers who he is and exposes him.<br /><br />Will definitely takes this role as his own while Eva Mendes does keep up with him quite nicely as her character has issues of her own that she deals with during the film. The dude from "King Of Queens" is a show stealer as he makes jokes that would've been just funny or not funny at all freakin' hilarious!<br /><br />I agree with the some of the previous reviewers about the content of the film. Though rated PG-13, you could actually almost leave your kids to watch this film as the sexual innuendos are almost non-existent and the bad language only pops up in a handful of scenes. Its almost suitable for families to watch. Make no mistake though, it is hilarious! Worth the price of buying.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>The movie is one of the better comedys from the past year (along with Harold and Kumar go to White Castle).  This movie has its bright moments and some of the film reminded me of Eddie Murphy's Nutty Professor and Boomerang.  Will Smith is entertaining as the date doctor who secretly helps a lot of guys win girls that they would never have a chance with otherwise.  His big assignment is to help a basically nice though "bumbling" guy win the heart of a Paris Hilton type heiress.  Many of the training scenes were in the trailer but are still extremely entertaining seeing them again in the film.<br /><br />My one big problem with the film and the reason it didn't rate 5 stars is that I saw a lack of real chemistry between Smith and Eva Mendez (the gossip columnist who is looking for the elusive date doctor and wants to expose him because her friend was hurt by one of his clients).  Granted the exchange between the two during their first meeting in a bar is excellent.  From there on it seems like there is nothing there especially during the times when Mendez acts really weird in front of Smith.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>"Hitch", Will Hitchens', clients are the bottom of the barrel as far as date material. These men pay the oh-so-cool Hitch to teach them how to capture the hearts of women.  Hitch is good at it, too, an impressive number of his clients have gotten 'hitched' to the ladies of their dreams.<br /><br />What happens when Hitch himself falls in love?  The man certainly needs help--but more than anything he needs to learn how to be himself to impress his lady.<br /><br />"Hitch" is a good afternoon's fun and definitely worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Cupid flutters around spreading happiness with his arrows of love and affection.  These arrows strike each target with one single attempt, as the person falls in love after the single moment when the arrow strikes them.  Love changes everything, as it means commitment, trust, and mutual affection when the love is answered.  Hitch (Will Smith) is the human cupid, as he works his magic as a partner consultant that helps men get noticed by the woman who is the target of their love.  Everything around Hitch oozes of class as nothing is cheesy, cheap, or corrupt. He is a true gentleman that helps others find their opportunity with love by shooting his arrows of affection.<br /><br />Hitch ended up becoming a love consultant due to an incident in college when he suffered from a broken heart.  Now he focuses on helping guys like he once was, as he helps them strategize their upcoming encounters and dates.  Carefully Hitch helps the men with how to approach the women, what to say, and how they must behave around the woman they love.  Everything is thoroughly planned, as it all comes down to one moment - the first kiss.<br /><br />When Hitch meets his freshest client Albert (Kevin James) he senses a disaster.  The problems increase when he finds out that Albert loves Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), a famous and incredibly rich woman.  Nonetheless, Hitch believes that he can pull it off by creating a masterpiece.  Simultaneously, he meets Sara (Eva Mendes), a relentless gossip columnist, with whom he falls in love.  This affair turns into a greater mess than expected for Hitch who finds himself kicking women, having severe food allergies, while Sara finds it difficult to combine personal life and professional life.<br /><br />Hitch is a warm comedy about love, affection, and the connection between people.  Will Smith is perfect for the role as Hitch, as he easily drifts into the gentle and cool character.  His performance is well balanced with the supporting cast, and Kevin James complements Will Smith by making the two look like contemporary Laurel and Hardy.  In the end, Hitch will offer an easy comedy with some great laughs, but also an interesting notion in regards about the opportunity of love.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Hitch is one of these movies that goes for the heart and is quite successful for the most part except where a few scenes towards the end overrun it a bit. Not watching the Hitch trailer is a big advantage as many of the best moments are in that 30 second burst. The introduction of Kevin James as Albert marks a new comedy actor on the rise and we can be sure to see plenty more of him... in fact Will Smith might be undercutting himself (after the summer blockbuster "I, Robot") by becoming the sidekick instead of the leading man in a number of scenes, we still shouldn't be blaming his agent, as this is the kind of comedy we want. The story revolves around Hitch, a sort of matchmaking cupid professional who specializes in the build-up and execution of that `one kiss shot' because `8/10 women believe that the first kiss tells them everything they need to know'. Upper-class fashion slave acolytes and executive board members make up Hitch's main customers and so we are definitely on `Sex in the City' ground that has taken a few lessons from old movies with the same sort of theme. This `Love Doctor' comedy is easily one of the better pleasantry surprises you will see in 2005.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Now and then movies with big name stars and expensive production budgets and PR hype that convince audiences that the Rapture is at hand hit the mat with a thud - and this HITCH is floored in the first half hour (of an overly long two hour movie!).  Using a script that uses every clich&eacute; from the myriad other films that tell this same story gimmick using females in the Smith role of date doctor, this movie limps along with silly dialogue and pratfall type of comedy, all of which could be forgiven if there was a magical chemistry between the two top stars to make it click.<br /><br />For all the talent Will Smith has demonstrated in the past (despite his recent over the top laffapaloozas like 'I, Robot', 'Men in Black I & II', 'Bad Boys I & II') such as 'Ali', 'Six Degrees of Separation', 'The Legend of Bagger Vance', he seems bent on accepting roles that are beneath him. In this bit of fluff he wastes time talking directly to the audience about the fine art of capturing a girl and then demonstrates his techniques ad infinitum on some blundering characters, ultimately  trying to apply his own wisdom in courting Eva Mendes. At this point there should be romantic magic to make this dud work, but the chemistry between the two is so polar that we are forced to wait out a dating game that is less interesting than a Home Depot commercial.<br /><br />The direction is sluggish when it begs to be slick and the acting is rudimentary at best.  NOT for fans of the gifts of Will Smith, but if you're in need of a popcorn summer flick to fan away the heat, you might try this lump of ice.

Smith's latest release in the adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel, "I am Legend", is absolutely extraordinary. However, "Hitch" (2005), reveals Smith's versatility as a comedic and dramatic actor. Hitch is a light a breezy romantic comedy about an anonymous "date doctor" who teaches nerds to get the women they desire. His tecniques work every time, until he meets a gossip jounalist, Sara Melas, (Eva Mendes) who presents a challenge for this charming "woman expert".<br /><br />There are some very funny scenes in this film, including the dance scene, where Albert Brennerman (Kevin James) shows Hitch his knowledge of dances, all particulary lame and so funny, this had audiences falling off their seats with laughter.<br /><br />My only criticism of this very funny film is I believe Eva Mendes' performance slightly strained as if she was trying just a little too hard, almost appearing to be over the top.<br /><br />In terms of plot, this is a typical boy meets girl film with a joyful ending, but what makes it is Will Smith and Kevin James, a great and unexpected brilliant comedy team.<br /><br />Good Fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>One of the better romantic comedies I've seen in a while.

Smith continues to prove that her really is a big screen actor.  He is charming, relaxed and easygoing in that real-person kind of way.  The best thing about this is that it doesn't rely on a lot of over-the-top romantic contrivances: playing two characters, constantly missing each other, getting too ditzy and silly : all big pluses.  The Kevin James plotline has the silliest bits, but even they are not over the top.  There is a genuinely sweet sincerity in this film, that really makes it work.  Eva Mendes is lovely and more serious than most of the girls chased in these films, Amber Valleta proves that she can actually deliver dialogue without being laughed at and James is the comically sweet loser/everyman.  Actually very well done.  One kind of comic nod to the old romatic comedies is a remote control Smith has in his apartment ala Rock Hudson in Pillow Talk - but it is quick and not an extended silly joke.  Definitely worth your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Will Smith stars in this funny film about dating and falling in love.  Smith stars as Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, the "Date Doctor".  He helps men find dates.  He has been rather successful at his work, as evidenced by the pictures of couples he helped get together hanging on his wall.  Hitch may have finally met his greatest challenge in Albert Brennaman (Kevin James).  Albert is a junior financial offecer who handles the account of heiress Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta).  Albert is desperate to have a relationship with Allegra, so he goes to Hitch for help.<br /><br />Hitch is skeptical at first, but he decides to try to help him.  This is the beginning of a friendship between Hitch and Albert.  Soon, Albert is going to fancy art galleries and New York Knicks games with Allegra.  Meanwhile, Hitch has found a woman that he likes.  Her name is Sara Melas (Eva Mendes).  She works as a newspaper gossip columnist. Hitch is immediately attracted to her, and the two begin dating.  In the meantime, Sara has seen the photos of Allegra and Albert that have been appearing in the papers.  Intrigued, Sara decides to do some investigationg of her own to find out why a socialite would be dating a junior accountant.<br /><br />What she finds out doesn't bode well for Hitch.  She finds out that he is indeed the infamous "Date Doctor".  Feeling hurt and betrayed, she breaks up with Hitch.  But is this really the end for them?  What will happen with Sara and Hitch and Allegra and Albert?<br /><br />This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in quite a while.  Will Smith was the perfect choice for the role of Hitch.  His funny disposition really makes the character shine.  Kevin James does an equally outstanding job as the bumbling but lovable Albert.  You can't help but root for him to get the seemingly unattainable "trophy girl".  Eva Mendes and Amber Valletta are also very good as Sara and Allegra.<br /><br />I recommend this movie very highly.  I'm a fan of Will Smith's music and movies, and he delivers perhaps his finest performance in this movie.  This is the perfect "date" movie, so if you're looking for something fun to do on date night, put this movie in, relax, and see a really great romantic comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>From the opening scene in Hitch of Overbrook Entertainment's logo of a record playing with the song Wonderful World (Don't Know Much) by Sam Cooke in the background, and Will Smith narrating what women think of when they wake up in the morning in the opening credits, you know you're in for a really good movie.<br /><br />Hitch is a romantic comedy directed by Andy Tennant (Sweet Home Alabama) and starring Will Smith (Bad Boys), Eva Mendes (Out Of Time), and comedian Kevin James.<br /><br />Smith plays Alex Hitchens (a.k.a. Hitch), a love doctor, who helps desperate single men make the right moves and get the women of their dreams. Things start to change for Hitch when he hooks up Albert, played hilariously by Kevin James in his first major motion picture starring role, with the most famous gorgeous woman in New York, Allegra Cole, played by the pretty Amber Valletta, whom he happens to be one of the accountants for. On the other hand, Hitch begins falling for Sara, a columnist for a major New York newspaper, who is following up on a story on Allegra Cole and her unknown hubby, Albert, and one woman who thinks the love doctor is nothing but a manipulative man who tricks women but doesn't know who he is in person. I think you get the picture as to where the movie goes next.<br /><br />Will Smith is perfect for the role of Hitch, he's charming and has one heck of a sense of humor. Kevin James steals the show with his outwardly funny antics. Those are only two of the reasons why Hitch works.<br /><br />The movie is simply the best romantic comedy of the year!<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A-</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>If you look at any of my other reviews, you'll see that I'm no "love story, chick flick wus." So there's my disclaimer. And there's your disclaimer. You can say: "some guy [(me)] on Amazon said, 'buy this flick; it's cool; it's not a chick flick; it's awesome entertainment for us macho, cool dudes.'"<br /><br />Hitch is better than a lot of the "trying-to-be-macho-but-really-a-chick-flick" films that I've rented or purchased in the past several years.<br /><br />Funny. Serious. Amusing. Witty. And, hey, I think I'll try some of the pick-up lines that Will Smith executes so flawlessly in this movie.  HEY! OUCH!  (That was my wife smacking me upside the head.)<br /><br />Overview: Will Smith teaches guys "that need help" how to get the girl of their dreams. Will finds his own "challenge", and the comedy of Will and his prot&eacute;g&eacute; acquiring their respective women makes for an awesomely realistic, modern day (macho!) love story.<br /><br />This flick is a keeper. Do you like movies in the vein of "Shallow Hal"? Then this is a movie for you.<br /><br />Hit the Add To Cart Button...if you're macho.</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>Last week, I got the chance to see Hitch, starring Will Smith, Eva Mendes, Kevin James, and Amber Valetta. In this movie, Alex Hitchens (Smith) serves as a "date doctor" for men looking to impress the women they love. Alex helps men show themselves off to their best advantage during their first three dates, because he believes that the first three dates, and particularly the first kiss, become a yardstick by which women measure where a relationship is going. "Hitch," as he is called, primarily tries to help (mostly bumbling) men put their best foot forward with his advice, although his specialty seems to be getting women to notice their admirers for the first time. He even helps shy accountant Albert Brennaman (James) catch the attention of famous actress Allegra Cole (Valetta).<br /><br />All of Hitch's advice seems to fall flat when he meets Sara Melas (Mendes), a gossip columnist for a local newspaper. After two disastrously bad dates, however, the two seem to develop a mutual liking for one another. Once Sara begins to suspect Hitch's profession, though, the relationship goes steeply downhill. It will take all of Hitch's charms, as well as a (literal) leap of faith, to find out what love really is all about.<br /><br />I thought this was a light, fun, predictable movie. All of the characters are likable and entertaining, particularly Kevin James as Albert Brennaman. (James does alot of cute physical comedy, and he's a very relatable character.) It would be a great date flick, and there are happy endings all around. Not much harsh language, and no sex scenes to speak of. (The movie lives up to its PG13 rating.)</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>This was kind of funny in certain parts but it's one of those old tales I keep seeing in Hollywood: boy and girl meet, boy has a secret, girl discovers it, there's a misunderstanding, they hate each other and then they love each other.<br /><br />Kind of cute but could we get some variety or is this all they think the masses want?<br /><br />There's a theme here about being yourself which has a lot of truth to it, but, there's also another theme about standing out in the beginning.  Make your own decision.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>All the funny scenes are in the preview, but this movies still has some cuteness that saves it. Not really a great romantic comedy, but it's mediocre. A fun way to waste 2 hours.</p></br><a href="../users/A2X6GEC6LCDN4S.html">A2X6GEC6LCDN4S</a><br/><p>This film had its very funny moments, even though it was dumbed down to about seventh grade humor.  Get ready for that seventh grade humor(ha ha).  Will Smith is a pretty good actor and it's fun to watch what his character will do next.  Kind of a formula picture, but it's good and fairly innocent fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A23L2BR07AOBG1.html">A23L2BR07AOBG1</a><br/><p>Why, you say?  Because the movie serves as a list of actual information to men about what to do, or not to do if they want to have a good chance with women, or increase their percentage of success at least.  As always, Will Smith is charming to no end and only helps men who really like women.  This film has gotten some great reviews from friends of mine who think it's a very good film and while I understand why they feel that way (it's one of the best that have come out in awhile and it doesn't feel tired, or like a retread) but I still find the conventions of this genre annoying.  As much as I enjoyed the relationship between Alex Hitchens and whatever her name was, I couldn't help but know that the writers had to throw a contrived obstacle in the way when it isn't really necessary.  For instance, Will Smith's character, Hitch, helps men who trip over themselves get their foot in the door with women and that's all, he's not a relationship counselor, he's a date doctor and I think the movie unfairly tags al</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Hitch is about a love doctor (Will Smith) who helps geeks get the girl. He's smooth and cool and Smith plays him well. However him working as a love doctor only gets interesting when Kevin James' (The King of Queens) character is introduced. That's when you get all the laughs and when the movie comes to life. He plays a nice heavy guy who's desperatly in love with a rich popular women. So Smith does everything in his power to make him cool. Their scenes together are great and when the movie works the most. The Smith story just isn't as good alone  without James so thank god for him. Don't get me wrong the Smith scenes where he's trying to get a girl but keeps messing up are pretty funny. James though with his goofy dancing and charm steals the movie everytime he's on screen. He's great in the King of Queens but also shows here that he could have a bright movie career. Him teaming up with the Rock could make a pretty entertaining movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>Will Smith always pretty much does the same role so not alot changes with Him on the Screen.Kevin James is kinda like the White Cedric The Entertainer in this film with His dancing&Antics. He is pretty much the bright spot of the film&that ain't saying much.the story line was cool.Eva Mendes is One Hot Mamma.but not much in terms of Acting.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this movie, but it went on for about a half-hour too long.  All the stuff at the beginning was good: the conceit of Will Smith being a "dating consultant" who has the secrets of letting "any" guy get "any" girl he wants.  What is good about the film are the performances from Will Smith and - surprisingly - Kevin James.  Everyone can relate to that awkward feeling around someone you like, and how good it would be to have an expert coach you through it.  It was also cute how Will Smith, as the expert, looses his cool around the girl he likes.<br /><br />Where the movie falls apart is when it gets into the standard cliches at the end.  Of course, Will Smith will meet an "evil" guy who will misrepresent him, and his girlfriend will get the wrong idea.  Couples will get together, break up, and magically reunite.  This is an OK rental, but I'd be mad if I saw it in theaters.  Not worth owning.</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>MY DVD ARRIVED THIS MORNING, AND, RELUCTANTLY I WATCHED IT, THAN I WATCHED AGAIN!

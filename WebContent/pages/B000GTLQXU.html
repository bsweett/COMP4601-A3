It has a lot of action and is very suspenseful. On New Year's Eve, a luxury cruise ship named after the Greek sea-god, Poseidon collides into a 150-foot tall rogue wave. After the ship is turned upside down, a small group of people try to make it to the surface alive. I highly recommend POSEIDON!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>It is New Year's Eve, and over 2,000 passengers & crew are ringing in the New Year aboard the huge cruise ship 'Poseidon' on the open sea in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean! A small group of survivors find themselves unlikely allies in a battle for their lives. Preferring to test the odds alone, career gambler Dylan Johns ignores captain's orders to wait below for possible rescue and sets out to find his own way to safety. What begins as a solo mission soon draws others, as Dylan is followed by a desperate father searching for his daughter and her fiancee--a young couple who hours before couldn't summon the courage to tell him they were engaged and now face much graver challenges. Along the way they are joined by a single mother and her wise-beyond-his-years son, an anxious stowaway and a despondent fellow passenger who boarded the ship not sure he wanted to live but now knows he doesn't want to die. Determined to fight their way to the surface, the group sets off through the disorienting maze of twisted steel in the upside-down wreckage. As the unstable vessel rapidly fills with water each must draw on skills and strengths they didn't even know they possessed, fighting against time for their own survival and for each other. This is a fun, adventure movie that keeps you pretty much on the edge of your seat. Worth seeing, great visual affects, fast paced, action/adventure.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>i really liked this movie, it was pretty good. the whole ship going upside down, having to find a way out before the ship sinks, and only a handful survive. i enjoyed it from beginning to end. the jumping, the climbing, and the swimming they did throughout the whole ship to get to their destination was nicely done. i do recommend because it has that good combination of action and suspense to draw you in. josh lucas was is a very good actor and here he just proved it again. something charming about this guy, and they way he just falls into the leadership role, and becomes the hero. kurt russell, the doting father, has to get through it with his daughter. he hasn't lost his touch. the small appearance of fergie was widely viewed as well. it wasn't another big ship sinks movie, but a story of survival, in one of the worst case scenarios. i do recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/A13F2IV3ME23R.html">A13F2IV3ME23R</a><br/><p>The reason to buy?  I never catch all the nuances of a story or the actors the first time around.  And buy only if you think you will like it!<br /><br />I have always like the Poseidon story - I thoroughly enjoyed the different take of this movie and the characters.  Although I understood it better after going into the Special Features.<br /><br />Josh Lucas was a great addition and of course I was interested because of Kurt Russell [who I loved in SOLDIER] not much dialogue there.<br />Richard Dreyfuss, I was curious to see how he has progressed from JAWS to ALWAYS to now.<br />And I am always fascinated on how they make a movie.  Wow! I have a great admiration for the actors and actress's who do a lot of their own stunts.<br />What they must go through to provide us with entertainment.  Especially the stunt men and women.  Seventy five shirts for Josh?<br /><br />I like this description of the ship - "13-deck, 20 stories tall Poseidon as it shifts, lurches and implodes" - Yup! I was waiting for the darn thing to explode.<br /><br />I had just got through watching "Mega Disasters" on History of these giant waves that can happen in the Atlantic and turn our coast lines into major disasters.  New York like another Venice.<br />I think a 150 foot "rogue" in the Atlantic with at least one ship a year being lost to one of these waves is hard to imagine - but a given fact.<br /><br />Believe me you will enjoy this version of Poseidon without too much trouble - the characters are recognizable - the shots are great - the coloring definitely excellent - I missed the music for the action.<br /><br />DEFINITELY RECOMMEND - for good clean action.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KFBAPAKMEQUF.html">A1KFBAPAKMEQUF</a><br/><p>Great movie.  Never saw the original, but this version was entertaining enough to keep me on the edge of my seat.  An adventurous, fast-paced movie, not overly sentimental - it's enough to keep you watching and engaged until the last frame.  Give it a try.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>I rented this and my dad, my aunt and I watched it together and I must say my aunt was on pins and needles, she was incredibly into it. Yet there's reviews(like critic reviews) that suggests the film was tepid, overproduced and a summer blockbuster masquerading as an important tragic story of survival. It's really one of those kind of films that wants to be more than it is, even though it's got the visuals to convince you so.<br /><br />Passengers on the cruise ship Poseidon are enjoying New Years' until a rogue wave smacks the ship and tips it over, making it float upside down, slowly flooding. The only way to get out is go up, which is in reality down towards the bottom of the ship. In their way stands a ton of water, small spaces and big stunts.<br /><br />One thing that's starting to become better with Hollywood in regards to its effects is the lack of novelty to it. No longer are we going "holy [...], how'd they do that?!" like Jurassic Park or Terminator 2. Since we've seen it so many times, as well as the documentaries on it, we know how it's done so it no longer knocks us down but we can follow the story better. The wave scene definately impresses at its coolest but it's not as "whoa!" like it would be in the early 90's. Much of the film was done by real sets and stunts by the real actors so it's more impressive.<br /><br />Where the film falls apart is its characterization. One character becomes rogue and wants to be alone until all of a sudden he gets into action hero mode while the mom is so inept at a mom that it's like "you mean she's still around?". Then there's one character that's super cute and I'm being biased but once she's gone, the film just kind of felt "meh". You can tell the filmmakers wants you to feel bad when someone dies but there's not much buildup to it(except for the cutie).<br /><br />What is also disappointing is the extras for the 2-disc. I've seen single discs with more special features than this. Wolfgang Petersen's quite the info heavy when it comes to commentaries...there isn't one. The film apparently went through a severe edit to make the film seem quicker yet there's no deleted scenes. Expect a triple-dip sometime in the future.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the film, I suggest waiting. You should rent it first just to...excuse the pun but "test the waters".</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>Poseidon runs a surprisingly brisk 99 minutes, with 10 minutes reserved for credits. It cost Warner $160 million dollars to produce, which means that the film cost $900, 000 for every thirty seconds of footage. Wolfgang Petersen's original cut was 125 minutes before someone, somewhere ordered him to cut it down. I think that this is the film's only failing as it's a full 20 minutes shorter than the original. The set pieces the film has to offer are all nail-biting and intense, but I just felt that there wasn't enough of them.<br /><br />I'm not such a big fan of the original. I liked it as a kid but viewing it as an adult I'm turned-off by the soap opera drama and dated effects. Back in the early 70s this may well have been fine but perhaps such advances in movie effects is why remakes of these kind of movies are not so unnecessary. Though I don't really consider this a 'remake' as it is just another version of Paul Gallico's novel.<br /><br />The characters are all likable and even though the set-up and introduction is pretty quick, we get to know enough and grow attached to them before the big wave hits (no longer a tsunami) and what a set-piece that turns out to be! The initial capsizing of the ship is a brilliantly edited destruction derby in which many, many human lives meet violent deaths. If there would be just one thing the film has to offer it is plenty of dead bodies. But why not go one step further and show some really heavy gruesomeness? I would have liked that!<br /><br />The idiots (there are usually loads in disaster films) stay behind in the ballroom while a bunch of more sensible survivors decide to escape by going up (down) to the engine room and out through the propeller tubes. Only because everything is inverted, there are loads of obstacles, including a race-against-time in a very small and very cramped air vent. Not all of them make it!<br /><br />It's a shame that Poseidon didn't do better at the box office but it faced stiff competition. The worldwide grosses maxed out at $181 million, so it only just barely broke even. For some reason Poseidon has had a bad reputation, which is doesn't deserve. The theatrical cut, available here on this Blu Ray, is stripped-down and on the nose. A fleshed-out extended version might win over the doubters.<br /><br />The Blu Ray features a great 2.35:1 1080p picture and a DTS HD-MA soundtrack with plenty of extras.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>`Poseidon' is of course the (second) remake of famous disaster movie `Poseidon Adventure' and the 2006 version comes with improved special effects. But what is truly remarkable about this new version is that it is shorter than the original by about 20 minutes. Wolfgang Petersen as director chose the opposite direction of King Kong,' and that is the real problem of this remake.<br /><br />`Poseidon' is, as you know, about the survival of the passengers in the titular doomed ocean liner. After the extremely dull opening 20 minutes, where we are introduced to the cardboard characters played by Kurt Russell, Josh Lucus, Richard Dreyfuss, Emmy Rossum, Jacinda Barrett, Mike Vogel, Mia Maestro, Jimmy Bennett, Freddy Rodriguez, Kevin Dillon, Stacy Ferguson, and Andre Braugher, the film suddenly gets into gear when a big `rogue wave' hits the ship, and completely overturns it.<br /><br />Now, WARNING. The sequences showing the disaster may be shocking to the younger kids as Petersen sticks to the `reality' of these scenes with lots of blood and dead bodies. The deaths are not suggested, but blatantly shown, with the state-of-the-art skills of ILM technicians.<br /><br />[EFFECT-RIDDEN] These effects about the water, fire, even explosions, are the only raison d'etre of this remake, and though you can easily see how and where Warner Bros. and other film companies spent as much as estimated $ 140 million, but you will never understand WHY.<br /><br />The 1972 original is sometimes (rightly, I think) accused of its corny dialogues or hammy acting, but the truth is we love the original `Poseidon Adventure' because of these corny and hammy actors. Shelley Winters' role might look ridiculous, yes, sure, but we love her for what she is, and love Ernest Borgnine and Stella Stevens too. It is still great fun to watch them even if the whole situation is totally unconvincing.<br /><br />What we get in this unnecessary remake is lots of actions that gradually changes from "catastrophic" to "overblown," and finally "very silly." I not only stopped caring who dies or not, but stopped caring what is happening on the big screen. I know I might be a little unfair, but for those who fondly remember the fun of watching the original and the other Irwin Allen productions, this remake is simply pointless except for the big, loud actions.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Poseidon is a great ship, a massive cruise liner with all the amenities, a disco, a lounge singer, a giant ballroom, and all sorts of top of the line bells, whistles, and ritz.  It doesn't matter how much you spit shine the Titanic, however, it's still going down.  Naturally, a tragedy is about to strike the ship.<br /><br />Evidently there are things called "rogue" waves, gigantic walls of water that come from nowhere and are impossible to predict.  This "rogue" wave blasts the ship, flipping it on its side, and nearly capsizing the Poseidon.  The buildup and explanation of what's happening is non-existent during this portion of the movie.<br /><br />Eventually, the ship turns upside-down, like a cup in the sink.  What follows is a race to climb up through the bottom of the boat, an escape from the probability of a watery grave.<br /><br />The acting is neither the saving grace nor the downfall of the movie; it's simply adequate.  There was fairly little character development, letting the viewer establish the character traits from the action on screen.<br /><br />Kurt Russell plays the tough guy, concerned father, expedition leader fairly well.  He exudes strength and confidence while displaying highly uncommon heroism and sacrifice.  He provides at least two genuine goose-bump scenes.<br /><br />Josh Lucas is the confident loner - who plays poker professionally - he's the brash risk taker desperate to exit, willing to risk it all.<br /><br />The rest of the escape crew fills in the cracks admirably, providing tension, excitement, and a helping hand in the escape.<br /><br />The added bonuses to this movie, of course, are that Leonardo DiCaprio is not a star, and an old lady doesn't mindlessly chuck a priceless diamond into the ocean at the end of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is slightly anticlimactic, and somewhat unreal (who knew there was so much material on board of a ship that was incendiary), but it's a very good thrill ride nonetheless.  The ending is what the viewer wants, and it's a worthwhile movie that had several exciting scenes, some stunning CGI, and enough action to enthrall.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>Oh Kurt Russel, what happened to you? Your roles in movies like The Thing and 3000 Miles to Graceland were great, and now you're like a cheap prostitute for a movie role. You just had to pick a worthless role of a father of a teenage daughter with all the stupid drama thrown in... a disaster movie. Great....<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Think of this movie as a combination of Titanic and The Perfect Storm. Then, remove the great characters and replace them with characters so worthless you care less about them being killed than stupid teenagers who get killed in horror movies, and then add liberal politics into the mix. During a cruise on the Poseidon, a gigantic freak wave causes the ship to capsize (flip upside down), trapping several people on board with a limited air bubble while they wait for help to come. But, a group of people decide not to wait and try to escape; a gambler, the gambler's smuggled girlfriend, a homosexual old man (Uuuugggghhhh....), an annoying kid (Why couldn't you drown in the movie?) and his mom, the mayor of New York (Kurt Russel), his daughter, and her boyfriend.<br />MUSIC: The music is bland and rarely sets the mood. It can at key moments, but fails to the rest of the time.<br />ACTION: The best parts of the film are scenes with the ship being flipped over, people drowning, things being turned over and destroyed, explosions, and some extra action. The action is the best part, too bad the whole film couldn't be filled with a lot more of those moments.<br />ACTING: The script is full of predictable dialogue, and the actors don't do a very good job bringing the already sub-par script to life. Their acting capabilities are laughable at best.<br />ENTERTAINMENT: You will only want to watch this movie for the action scenes, not really anything else. If you wish to see all of it, I hope you have humor, because you will only get pissed off if you don't. Take advantage of the flaws and laugh at them, because they are laughable (Yay! We've escaped! Oh look, there just so happens to be a raft over there).<br />OVERALL: I would only recommend this as a rental for now, not a buy. I managed to take advantage of the flaws and laugh at them for how bad they were, but this film was overall very disappointing and had so much more potential. Plus, adding politics into the mix, kinda ruins the experience. Decent overall, but disappointing.<br />THE GOOD: The action moments.<br />THE BAD: The acting, the politics, predictable dialogue and events, unintentionally funny.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>and keeps you watching! There really isn't enough of the story line in the mix though. It could only be better if there had been. Rogue wave meets ocean liner and it doesn't turn out very well for most of the passengers!</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I must say, I have a fascination with anything water based in movies. Titanic, Hard Rain, and now Poseidon. I'm actually shocking myself to say that Poseidon is rivalling Titanic in my eyes. But Titanic is my main love.<br /><br />I'd already seen The Poseidon Adventure, and Beyond The Poseidon Adventure, before I got to see this on HD, so I knew what to expect. I thought I'd feel some loyalty towards the original, but I was blown away by this, and to watch it on a massive screen AND in HD as well, words cannot describe the experience. The sound is absolutely amazing, we had to keep turning the sound down, in order not to frighten the neighbours, and the picture is beyond perfect. Honestly I can't rave about HD much more. I actually went out the next afternoon to buy the regular DVD to compare, but I just had to do the review first. I loved the movie that much that I would have bought it anyway.<br /><br />I agree with some other reviewers that yes, the character development is not great, but I hope someday there will be a director's cut, as many of Fergie's scenes got cut. Fergie (or Stacy Ferguson if you prefer) was my one highlight of seeing this film - at the time I didn't realise Kurt Russell or Mia Maestro was in it - but I was disappointed to see she didn't have very much screen times. She's gorgeous, and has a gorgeous voice to match, but we didn't get to hear much of the latter either. I wish she could have shown off her acting skills by being one of the survivors. If only for a little while. My other very small problems with the movie were the loss of the Christmas tree, which played a pivotal role in the original. That should have stayed. The fact that not many of the passengers in the ballroom get a choice whether to go or not with the ragtag bunch of determined-to-escape passengers (Fergie, lift your feet and go!) I felt was also wrong. As they could have tried to escape. But then it did make for a spectacular scene, particularly when Fergie's character went over to the captain (I think?) and gave him a hug. That's when you know they know they have nothing left, but to surrender to whatever is about to happen.<br /><br />Also, some reviewers have complained about the fact that the scene with spotting the rogue wave on radar was cut. Why complain?! The director had to cut something to cut it down, it was probably unnecessary anyway, so it has to go. You have to be brutal. But this starts the sentimentality of the film - Richard Dreyfuss's character, alone at New Year, since his partner deserted him, is the first to spot the rogue wave, interrupting his impromptu suicide attempt. Believe me, if you're going to start crying at a film that was the point I nearly did! What a wuss.<br /><br />The rest of the cast were excellent though, my favourite was Mia Maestro, who I already knew from starring in Alias. She was the only person who stopped to help Jennifer (Emmy Rossum) & Chris (Mike Vogel), and her fear when they were trapped in that very small, and partly caved in air vent made me genuinely terrified myself. And let's face it, her cross necklace saved the day in the end!<br /><br />Most of the characters you will begin to warm to just when the ship capsizes in a few shocking minutes, when I swore I would never set foot on a ship again! There are the few stereotypical characters, mainly the Kurt Russell character, doing the overbearing and overprotective father routine on his daughter who's secretly engaged. The single mother & her son weren't given THAT much screen time - a lot of the others did get more - but the scene were she's on one side of a wall, and he's on the other, and it's slowly filling with water, will bring out the maternal side to anyone.<br /><br />Of course, with these films it's always a race against time, which is probably why I enjoy them so much. What's so original about this & funnily enough, the original is that the ship is capsized. Therefore, a million times the obstacles, and a REAL race against time, and the rising water. (Plus I can't swim that well, so it makes it even more shocking.) Yes, some of the characters do die along the way (and there's a similar death to Shelley Winter's death from the original), and I did shed a little tear, at one particular character death. I had to hide my face behind the cushion I just happened to be clutching throughout most of the film. Some of the death scenes, albeit not gory, were very realistic, and the expressions on the characters as they died have left an impression on me. Elevators come crashing down (look out if you happen to be UNDERNEATH it at the time), people fall great heights, and bodies get burnt to a crisp. Nice images huh?<br /><br />I absolutely adore this movie, and eagerly await a possible director's cut, or a better special edition, with deleted scenes. There appear to be no deleted scenes featured on the HD, although it's not much of a loss, when you see what is on it. You're quite spoilt. Complete with an in movie experience, which I'm not sure about, as I think, as I do with commentaries, it could be quite irritating.<br /><br />This movie is now a major high up feature on my favourites list, and I'm so happy to actually own it myself. Even if it's not on HD. But I'll make do. I'll try and sneak the HD into the DVD player again soon.</p></br><a href="../users/ACO20QL72D1E6.html">ACO20QL72D1E6</a><br/><p>but compared to the 1972 classic, it sadly lacks the star power...  When disaster hits the almost Titanic of a new luxury liner, the remake surpasses the original a long way.<br /><br />The demise of the ship in the end is also a scene that parallells the 1997-epic about a certain ship - as a matter of fact - some scenes even surpasses THAT 1...<br /><br />Josh Lucas  is good as a human being... not good... not evil...  but something in between:-)) Richard Dreyfuss is good as well...<br /><br />The rest of the cast suffers because they are 1-dimensional soap-stars... sorry but they do appear to be just that...<br /><br />The surviving scenes in the end are a bit too much on the far-fetched side....<br /><br />In the end it is a OK remake, but no way if it surpasses "The Poseidon Adventure" in a long shot... Let the two films live together, side by side....</p></br><a href="../users/A359IT81FBX64Y.html">A359IT81FBX64Y</a><br/><p>The producers of this movie may believe that all the special effects make it unsinkable, but after hitting multiple icebergs of bad plot, bad dialogue, bad character development, even bad background music and a bad torch song, it sinks like a lead zeppelin. The special effects were fine, but I can't say they were better than the special effects in the 1972 version. I can't believe that the same director who did Das Boot and The Perfect Storm did this; it is not Wolfgang Petersen's style to keep things moving from one special effects crisis to the next. This film is the most pathetic so far this year, and I hope it doesn't even garner any special effects Oscar nominations; it's better left on the bottom of the sea and forgotten. There may be survivors in the story, but there are none in the audience.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>Whew!  Where to begin.  The perfectly even, precision like blade of a slow-moving rogue wave, the large square rapidly-filling-with-water rooms, the intense human drama?  Man!  This is bad ...really bad.<br /><br />I appreciate the attempt at updating the action, but too much CGI and it looks like an overblown video game to me.  We get, like 4 or 5 minutes of exposition to get to know the charicatures, oops characters, before the big perfectly even ...<br /><br />Anywho - who cares about these people?  All the girls look alike - especially under water.  All the guys have that tortured fart-smell face.  Really  this is a stinker.<br /><br />The orginal may be no state of the art production - but compared to this it's The Godfather.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>What is it with Wolfgang Peterson and water?<br /><br />Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the newest entry in the Greed Won Over Better Judgement Awards... And the winner is "Poseidon".<br /><br />Directed by Wolfgang Peterson, "Poseidon" is a completely unnecessary film. And it isn't a very good unnecessary film. Made because they have no original ideas and better special effects to display those ideas, Warner Bros. clearly wanted (needed?) a popcorn film to fill the multiplexes over the weekend. Someone suggested the 1972 film "The Poseidon Adventure" deserved to be remade (stop laughing, it happened.) and they called on Wolfgang Peterson to hammer out a special effects and action extravaganza. Apparently, Peterson has been typecast as the `Water' director; after "Das Boot", "The Perfect Storm" and now "Poseidon", he is clearly the guy to go to if your story involves water and your actors will get wet.<br /><br />But why was "Poseidon" remade? The 1972 film is remembered for two reasons; the ship overturns and Shelly Winters in an evening dress crawling through small passageways. Last year, a television movie was made; this time, a terrorist's bomb causes the boat to capsize and one of the survivors is a Homeland Security agent. How timely. So why is this version hitting the multiplexes? Money and more money. Studios feel like they have to release two or three big budget "tent poles" every summer. These films cost a lot of money and will (hopefully) bring in a lot of money and ticket buyers. Sometimes, they hit it big ("Spiderman"), other times; they lose ("Poseidon"). Before these big films begin playing, the studio will get to show one or two previews for some of their other big summer offerings, trying to win potential ticket buyers. Before "Mission Impossible III", Paramount included a preview for "Nacho Libre", a film I suspect cost about a third of Tom Cruise's salary alone. Before "Poseidon", we saw trailers for "The Lake House", a new weepy romance starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock (probably cost about a third of "Poseidon") and "Superman Returns" (which probably cost more, a lot more.) So, long story long, it's all about economics. The studios would rather spend $120 million on a special effects filled offering rather than finance a dozen Wes Anderson or Woody Allen films.<br /><br />For those of you that don't know... The Poseidon, a luxury cruise ship, is traveling across the Atlantic on New Year's Eve. Just as the guests reach one in the countdown, a `rogue wave', as the Captain (Andre Braugher, in probably the most thankless role of the film) later explains, catches the ship broadside, causing it to flip upside down. Many people die, but the survivors include Dylan (Josh Lucas), a gambler and former Navy man who was never happier than when he was broke, Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), a former fireman and the Mayor of New York and Richard Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss), a [...] architect who is trying to get over a bad breakup. The group also includes a single mom (Jacinda Barrett) and her `adorable' little boy, Jennifer Ramsey (Emmy Rossum, the musical "The Phantom of the Opera"), Richard's daughter and Christian (Mike Vogel), her boyfriend and new fianc&eacute;e. As soon as the ship capsizes, Dylan figures he can find a way out and this ragtag group of people follows him through various obstacles. Some of them will make it, some won't.<br /><br />Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell are both good actors and the only reason I can think of for their involvement is money. Why would they agree to make a film in water tanks, soaked to the bones during the entire day, when their characters have little, if any, character? This is the type of film where character development is done in quick, broad strokes. Anything we learn about them is learned through quick, off hand comments. "I was never as happy as when I was broke". "May dad was Mayor of New York when I was young". "That must've been great." "It wasn't". Basically, the only way a film like this will help their careers is if it is a huge hit. The film doesn't require them to act particularly well, so it all comes down to money. And because the film cost so much, the likelihood of a huge hit diminishes.<br /><br />There are many reasons for newcomers like Jacinda Barret, Emmy Rossum, Mike Vogel and Freddy Rodriquez to appear in the film. Exposure, exposure and more exposure. They are at the point in their careers where any film will help, no matter how bad. Appearing in a multi-million dollar film of this sort can only help their careers. Who knows? It might even help them stay away from the slasher/ horror films so many actors of their age populate.<br /><br />Richard Dreyfuss? Just behind John Travolta for most career revivals, Dreyfuss' career could use a shot in the arm. Here he plays a [...] architect. You see, he's an architect so he can say things like "This ship isn't designed to survive underwater." Presumably, an architect knows about these things. But then again, wouldn't anyone? He seems to be a `[...]' architect to be merely pathetic. At one point, he calls his ex-lover and leaves a voice mail. "I'm begging, aren't I?" At another point, he calls Freddy Rodriguez's character gorgeous. This happens as they are trying to traverse an upside down elevator shaft. I guess this is why his character has an ex-lover.<br /><br />For a moment, I thought Kevin Dillon's character Lucky Lou had been transported intact from the 1972 original. His character is so laughably over the top you will also cheer when he dies.<br /><br />As the story progresses, the already spotty dialogue degenerates further as we get statements like "There is no other way!" or "I can't do it." "Yes, you can." "The water is rising." Yes, all serviceable, but because we know so little about the characters this dialogue only serves to make each person all the more two-dimensional.<br /><br />Yes, the special effects are impressive, when the ship is turning over, but after this point, the film looks like it was filmed in water tanks. The cast encounter a series of obstacles, all of which take place in closed, confined spaces. But because we know so little about the characters, it is difficult to care if they ever make it through the obstacle course alive.<br /><br />As in any disaster film, some of the recognizable faces will make it out alive, some won't. Some of the newer faces will make it out, some won't. But all will go on to appear in new movies and projects. Hopefully, much better new movies and projects.<br /><br />If "Mission Impossible III" represents the best a summer can offer, "Poseidon" represents the worst; a film made to showcase special effects with little attention to character or story. Thankfully, this remake seems shorter than the original. Everything seems to move a lot faster without Shelly Winters holding them back.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>With less plot than a video game, and not much acting to be had, this movie's only saving grace are the special effects, but even those wouldn't warrant a second viewing.

Even though this doesn't even come close to the original, it's not a total loss. The special effects and even some of the CG are impressive. And just the look of the massive ship both before and after the tragedy are awesome to watch. But the acting is rather bland, and that totally surprised me considering the cast. Also, Wolfgang Petersen made The Perfect Storm, which was a great movie, so I know he knows how to do wave effects, but the 'Rogue Wave' that turns the Poseidon looks lame and cheap, not very exciting at all. Not too mislead anyone, since I graded this a C, it actually deserves 2.5 stars, mmmkay?</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>Ugghhh.... 40 minutes into this remake disaster, we hit the EJECT button.<br /><br />Yes... with modern effects the waves were bigger, the flames bigger the explosions were bigger.....<br /><br />So what was missing ?<br /><br />SOUL and a concern about the characters.<br /><br />The remake was all "flash" and "effects" with no "life" to the characters.<br /><br />Unlike the original with Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, etc...<br /><br />In this remake you simply don't care if the main characters live or die..... nor do you get lost in the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2N69DJM8NVYZ6.html">A2N69DJM8NVYZ6</a><br/><p>When I first heard of this movie, I thought it would be something like Titanic, but I was wrong. This movie is also about a ship that sinks but only here almost everybody dies in the first twenty minutes of the movie. Only 6 or 7 people survive. I thought it wasn't that interesting. It's not worth watching on a big screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>It all started with Paul Gallico's novel, "The Poseidon Adventure," which I found fascinating due to the way it presented a fairy tale disguised as a modern survival story. I say this mostly because of character development; each person was assigned a given personality that never faltered and often times created great conflict as they made their way through the bowels of the capsized S.S. Poseidon, a luxurious but aging ocean liner. Despite most being unwilling to band together, they were still drawn to the leadership of an obsessively driven reverend, and in an almost supernatural way, they continued on their journey.<br /><br />Then came Irwin Allen's 1972 film adaptation, something that focused more on the action than on the humanity of the situation. I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of this version; I guess I was too bogged down by the original novel and the way it banded a group of one-tracked characters together. It did succeed in providing some good visual material (even though the special effects are cheesy looking by today's standards), and it gave audiences a lot of familiar faces to root for (Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelly Winters, Red Buttons, and Jack Albertson just to name a few). But on the whole it felt flat, emotionless, and shallow.<br /><br />Now we have Wolfgang Petersen's remake, simply entitled "Poseidon." Petersen--perfectly capable of handling nautical tragedies ("The Perfect Storm")--has crafted a much more entertaining adaptation despite the fact that character development is seriously lacking (meaning that it bears little if any resemblance to Gallico's novel, other than the capsized ship). There's really no need to describe the basic plot; anyone who's read the book or seen the original film will know what to expect. And even if they haven't done either, the trailer for this new version pretty much says it all: on New Year's Eve, a freak title wave hits the ship and flips it over, leaving precious little time for a handful of survivors to work their way to the keel and escape.<br /><br />The aspects of the story created just for this version focus only on special effects and character names. Gone are the Reverend Frank Scott, Mike and Linda Rogo, Manny and Belle Rosen, Susan and Robin Shelby, and James Martin. Instead, we have: Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas), a former navy officer; Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), a retired firefighter and former Mayor of New York; his daughter, Jennifer (Emmy Rossum), secretly engaged to the love of her life, Christian (Mike Vogel); Richard Nelson (Richard Dreyfus), an architect reeling over the breakup with his boyfriend; Maggie James (Jacinda Barrett) and her son, Conor (Jimmy Bennett); and Elena Gonzales (Mia Maestro), a stowaway desperate to reach New York and visit her hospitalized brother.<br /><br />In terms of the special effects, I think it's obvious that the model-ship-in-a-tub quality shots of the original film don't hold a candle to the work put into this remake. The destruction scenes are absolutely amazing, and for that we can thank computer generated imagery. The overall design of the Poseidon itself is striking, looking more like a streamlined, modern luxury liner than a cheap imitation of the Queen Mary. It's the kind of look that lends itself better to the moments of action, which are numerous to say the least; certain sections of the ship can't seem to stop flooding, and there are enough explosions to keep thrill junkies on the edge of their seats. It takes the action to a level the original film didn't dare explore by making it fast paced and adrenaline pumping.<br /><br />Of course, I can't forget that because this takes place in the present day, the technology is much more advanced. Is this an improvement? Not necessarily, although it does make the danger they're in more realistic (because, as we all know, technology doesn't always ensure survival). In both the novel and the original film, the characters made the perilous journey with only the hope that they might be rescued. But in reality, they had no way of knowing if they had any chance of survival. In today's world, there are GPS satellite tracking systems and automatic distress signals. In "Poseidon," help is definitely on the way for these people. It's just a matter of time. It's also a matter of who makes it and who doesn't (and you probably already know that not everyone does).<br /><br />In this sense, it's almost symbolic that the characters are forced to encounter death on their journey (just as it's symbolic that the ship is named after the destructive ancient Greek god of the sea). They frequently pass dozens of dead bodies that are strewn throughout the wreckage, signaling a kind of cinematic foreshadowing. This aspect of the story was prominent in the novel but barely alluded to in the original film; in that version, the dead are shown sparingly, making it seem like the characters were traveling through a deserted ghost ship. It wasn't plausible because an ocean liner holds thousands of people during a voyage, not just in passenger friendly areas, but in the lower decks, as well. The remake did a better job of showing that the people are trying to escape from a tomb as well as from a sinking ship.<br /><br />It's interesting that I found "Poseidon" so much more enjoyable than "The Poseidon Adventure," considering the humanity of Gallico's story still hasn't been explored. Maybe I went into the remake knowing that his Disaster at Sea fable wouldn't be taken into serious consideration; it's an upgrade of the original film, not the novel. That must have enabled me to turn off my feelings for it and focus only on the new material. Everyone always says an original is better than a remake, but apparently, that isn't always the case. I will say that "Poseidon" isn't better than the novel; that was far too unique to be overshadowed by a film adaptation. But as a film and as a remake, it works.<br /><br />Take whatever you will from this upgraded movie. It delivers exactly what it promises in a relatively short period of time, and it definitely isn't boring. I'd recommend it, even to the diehard fans of Irwin Allen's 1972 film. Maybe it's time they get upgraded, as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I must say that the acting is average at best, though Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell try to elevate it, and the dialogue is below average. Emmy Rossum is pretty bad here, but at least she looks good. If you go to a movie about a ship that flips over due to a 100 foot wave that pops up out of nowhere, leaving people trying to make it the top (actual bottom) of the ship, are you really expecting good acting and dialogue? The special effects are good, but I still can't figure out where the 160 million dollar budget went. It is fast paced and entertaining at times. I didn't feel like I wanted my money back when I left the theater, but then again I knew what to expect going in. Can't wait to see The Da Vinci Code, X-Men III, Superman Returns, and Pirates of the Caribbean 2. It's gonna be a fun summer at the movies!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>To the preservationists who say that one should only re-make bad movies...not good ones...think this: One should re-make old movies and make them at least as good or better. Poseidon accomplishes neither.<br /><br />The Poseidon Adventure (1972) was a better movie than Poseidon. It had better actors. And sadly the special effects were just as good in the original from over 30 years ago. Shameful.<br /><br />Here are some examples of random silliness without the movie trying to be silly:<br /><br />-Lots of fires but absolutely no smoke.<br />-Civilians are smart enough to try to find a way out of impending doom but none of the ship's officers agree.<br />-A guy blindly dives from a ledge into a flooded room assuming that it's deep enough and there will be nothing in the water to impale him.<br />-Several rafts conveniently waiting upon escape from the ship into the water.<br />-Immediately after escape the ship sinks...nick of time escape is goofy.<br />-Rescue calvary consists of 2 commuter-type helicopters...not the coast guard.<br /><br />Oh and there's plenty more silliness. Don't buy this. Don't rent it. Wait for cable at best.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Poseidon is a great ship, a massive cruise liner with all the amenities, a disco, a lounge singer, a giant ballroom, and all sorts of top of the line bells, whistles, and ritz. It doesn't matter how much you spit shine the Titanic, however, it's still going down. Naturally, a tragedy is about to strike the ship.<br /><br />Evidently there are things called "rogue" waves, gigantic walls of water that come from nowhere and are impossible to predict. This "rogue" wave blasts the ship, flipping it on its side, and nearly capsizing the Poseidon. The buildup and explanation of what's happening is non-existent during this portion of the movie.<br /><br />Eventually, the ship turns upside-down, like a cup in the sink. What follows is a race to climb up through the bottom of the boat, an escape from the probability of a watery grave.<br /><br />The acting is neither the saving grace nor the downfall of the movie; it's simply adequate. There was fairly little character development, letting the viewer establish the character traits from the action on screen.<br /><br />Kurt Russell plays the tough guy, concerned father, expedition leader fairly well. He exudes strength and confidence while displaying highly uncommon heroism and sacrifice. He provides at least two genuine goose-bump scenes.<br /><br />Josh Lucas is the confident loner - who plays poker professionally - he's the brash risk taker desperate to exit, willing to risk it all.<br /><br />The rest of the escape crew fills in the cracks admirably, providing tension, excitement, and a helping hand in the escape.<br /><br />The added bonuses to this movie, of course, are that Leonardo DiCaprio is not a star, and an old lady doesn't mindlessly chuck a priceless diamond into the ocean at the end of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is slightly anticlimactic, and somewhat unreal (who knew there was so much material on board of a ship that was incendiary), but it's a very good thrill ride nonetheless. The ending is what the viewer wants, and it's a worthwhile movie that had several exciting scenes, some stunning CGI, and enough action to enthrall.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>The original "Poseidon Adventure" was loaded with action, soap opera, and totally unbelievable events. I'm still amused that middle-aged Shelley Winters had her high school breath-holding medal around her neck at a crucial moment. The new film is probably better, though it lacks serious character development. At the time of such a crisis, I doubt everyone will stop and talk about their lives, so it makes sense. CGI effects were Oscar nominated and Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell were fine, as well as Emmy Rossum. Jacinda Barrett overacted horribly, but the kid who played her son was excellent. I still don't know why the old super-epics need to be re-made, but in the hands of Wolfgang Peterson, this was better drama. Irwin Allen's original was more fun, if only for the schlock, and it's "original" idea from Paul Gallico, who also wrote "The Three Lives of Thomasina"..in the 30's. Re-imagining ideas will always be exciting to the Hollywood honchos. Do they realize that some original material might appeal to the public?</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Indeed, who better to helm a mega budget, CGI heavy remake of the Poseidon Adventure than Wolfgang Petersen?  The director of Troy, Das Boot, and The Perfect Storm re-works the 70's classic with some incredible tools at his disposal, as well as a potential-laced cast (Josh Lucas, Kurt Russell, Richard Dreyfus, Emmy Rossum, Jacinda Barret, Andre Braugher, Freddy Rodriguez, and Kevin Dillon), but alas, Poseidon ends up being the mega budget, mainstream, brainless, disaster flick that you probably think it is.  The script does absolutely nothing to make the viewer feel any kind of sympathy or attachment to the characters, let alone care what happens to any of them as they all fight to survive when the state of the art, luxury ship capsizes after being hit by a massive wave.  Despite the incredible looking CGI effects and some great, old fashioned stunt work, Poseidon ultimately falls flat in the department that could have made it something truly special: character development.  It's not incredibly bad by any means, and definitely worth seeing for rainy day or brainless entertainment, but in any other case besides, you won't miss anything if you never see Poseidon.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>When word that Wolfgang Petersen -- director of such fantastic films as DAS BOOT, ENEMY MINE, and THE PERFECT STORM -- was slated to direct the remake of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE (now shortened to simply POSEIDON), the sizzling hype around Hollywood was immediately palpable. Production costs for the heavily CGI-laden film skyrocketed to $160 million, making it one of the most costly films of 2005 (released in 2006).<br /><br />Adding to the costs was an ensemble cast starring Josh Lucas (GLORY ROAD), Kurt Russell (SKY HIGH), Richard Dreyfuss (MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS), Emmy Rossum (THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, 2004), Freddy Rodriguez (LADY IN THE WATER), and Kevin Dillon (24 TV Series).<br /><br />Now The Poseidon Adventure (1972) wasn't that great a film to begin with, but what it did have was a catchy tune sang by Karen Carpenter ("It's Got To Be The Morning After") and a great human story surrounded by a terrible event: the capsizing of a cruise ship. Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons, Roddy McDowall, Shelly Winters, and Jack Albertson rounded out that all-star cast. And although the production was a bit cheesy by today's standards, it held at its center a tale of human determination and sacrifice. This was the focus. The destruction of the ship was just the catalyst, not the focal point. Which is where Wolfgang's remake encounters significant problems.<br /><br />The character set-up in Poseidon is rushed, never giving the audience a sense of empathy or angst for any of the people onboard. More film time is given to the CGI water, fires, explosions, and other non-character items. Many times during the film we are yanked away from the characters in order to watch yet another explosion happen somewhere on the ship, then we're jerked back to the characters who don't really respond to it. So what was the purpose of showing the movie-watcher these things? The simple answer is because it was CGI, it was cool, it cost money, so you have to show it in order to justify your budgetary expenses.<br /><br />Since we're given so little time to understand or appreciate the characters' interactions with one another, when one of them dies there's no impact for the viewer. Most will probably say, "So what" when this person or that gets snuffed out by the expensive CGI water, fire, or explosion.<br /><br />Hollywood needs to learn that it's the people in the film audiences care about, not the "totally awesome" special effects. Sure, directors/producers can put the CGI in there and make it look nice, but it has to have an impact on the characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A2809U2S14N0K1.html">A2809U2S14N0K1</a><br/><p>I was very keen on the early Poseidon adventure which I liked. So I was keen to see what Wolgang Petersen, a director I do like, could do with the story.<br /><br />It found it to being a good movie. It did keep the viewers interests as our heroes go from one episode to the next. So much so I lost track of time throughout the movie.<br /><br />Having said that this movie has to be compared to the 1972 effort. In which case, I would have to say like so many copies that its not as good as the original. The characters are not so interesting nor is the acting. The story was better explained in the first one and more believable. The special effects are approximately as good. The filming however is better as the newer technology shows.<br /><br />Still it is worth looking at.</p></br><a href="../users/A331OF34UX4Y1K.html">A331OF34UX4Y1K</a><br/><p>In my opinion, this is really a shallow, insipid and utterly stupid movie, even by Wolgang Petersen's standards.... Iwas extremely dissapointeds withe the mess. You simply don't care if any of the characters will survive or all of them will die. And as for the impossibility of 99% of the things that happen in the movie, well, it's just escapism, but they exaggerated a LOT in this department...</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This movie is certainly one that can wait for rental, but if you can catch it cheaply, then it is a nice effects big movie screen type of movie.  Outside of the effects, the movie is just okay.  It follows the same basic concept of the original Poseidon adventure and updates it with new characters.  The idea is the same however with a few survivors trying to make it to the top which was the bottom of the ship to escape.  Russell is convincing in his role, with a stellar name cast mostly just okay and working with what is given to them.  If you love The Day After Tomorrow and Deep Impact, then this is the film for you.  Otherwise, wait for it to hit dvd.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ICW5OUWX2A2V.html">A2ICW5OUWX2A2V</a><br/><p>Think you've had a bad day?  Well, you haven't been on board a gigantic ocean liner that's been hit by a rogue tidal wave, capsized, and then is subsequently flooded while the few survivors try desperatly to escape before the big boat plunges to the bottom of the ocean.<br /><br />Poseidon was (along with the as-of-this-writting, unreleased "Snakes on a plane") the one big movie that I was looking forward to in 2006.  It had everything going for it.  An incredibly cool trailer, a great concept, state of the art CGI effefts, and a director who has had more then his fair share of water films.  It had everything going for it, and had all the elements of a blockbuster summer action movie.<br /><br />Alas, it was not to be.<br /><br />What went away here?  Perhaps it's the pacing and the timing.  A common complaint for Titanic when it came out way back in 1997 is that it took too long to get to the actual sinking.  Here, we get to the sinking in what feels like ten minutes.  In no time flat the boat has been hit by the wave, is upside down, and the escape attempt beings.  After that it's just bang, bang, bang as the film moves from one scene to another, barely giving you any time to catch your breath.<br /><br />This is probably the films greatest weakness.  It just moves far too quickly.  As an aspiring film editor, i'm aware that all the elements that don't add to the plot or the action at hand need to be cut out, but I just couldn't help but feel that a LOT of good material was cut out to try and keep the movie going as quickly as possible.  And when you cut out such material, your movie may go faster, but it looses  lot in the process, and I think that's what happened with Poseidon.<br /><br />One of my favorite aspects of James Cameron's Titanic is that it took the time to introduce it's charachters, build thier relationships and make us care about them.  By doing so, the movie was more gripping as the ship was sinking because we cared about Jack and Rose as the ship sank (I admit it, I cried when Jack turned into a popsicle).  Here, your charachters are nameless generic people (old guy, mom and kid, rouge anti-hero) who's names you forget five seconds after the credits start rolling.  Although the film does try to do some development, it just doesn't work.  I diddn't care for any of our heros (save for Richard Dreyfus, because it's always cool to see elderly people rise up to escape disaster), and I wasn't really sad when any of them died.  I will say this however, Poseidon does bend the rules a bit when it comes to charachter deaths.  Just like the shark film Deep Blue Sea, you never really know who's going to die.  One death in paticular, is given to a charachter who I thought for sure was going to live, and it suprised me when he/she died.<br /><br />The film isn't helped by the dialogue.  Now, to be fair, it is hard to write dialogue that doesn't sound expositional and i'm sure the scriptwritters tried hard, but the dialoge just sounds...well...artificial.  It's structured in a way that gives us the charachter's background and thier stories while trying to make us care about them.  Sadly, it doesn't work.  There are a few moments where the dialogue is actually silly.  When one of our heros says (in repsponse to the dad heading towards the disco room), "What?  You got an urge to dance now?"  I couldn't help but raise my hand in the John Travolta disco style, much to the laughter of other people in the theater.  When people in the audience are giggling and laughing at some of what is said on screen in a disaster movie, that can't be a good thing.<br /><br />In a way, Poseidon is just an excuse to go and watch big things happen on screen.  And this is the film's greatest strength.  It's a visual movie.  It's not a charachter driven epic, rather, it's a big action movie that spent the time and money on the visual effects, and it shows.  From the very cool capsizing sequence to the final plunge of the liner, Poseidon does hit the mark when it comes to great visuals.  Unfortunitly, the best moments are scattered throughout the film (such as the capsizing at the beginning and the final sinking at the end).  The rest of the time, we get pretty good visuals, but these just aren't as spectacular as the big stuff.<br /><br />Now, inevitably, comparisons are come up between Poseidon and Titanic, and in a way they are to be expected.  Both films are about sinking ships and the people on board.  The sad thing is, Titanic is just better then Poseidon in almost every way.  It's bigger, it has a more epic feel, and it has charachters we care about.  It takes it's time building up to the big event and keeps the flow going nicely without being too quick or too slow.<br /><br />Sadly, Poseidon has everything backwards.  Poseidon is full of charachters we don't care about, it moves far too quickly and relies more on big visuals over a good story.<br /><br />I really don't like giving this movie a low score because I had high hopes for it, and it is clear that Mr. Peterson and his crew put a lot of effort into making it (the design of the sets and the movie are quite good), but it just moves far too quickly and pretty much ignores charachters in favor of big effects. If you do want to see it, go in expecting a (very) fast paced movie that's big on visuals and don't go in expecting gripping charachters and complex relationships.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Director Wolfgang Peterson seems to be in such a terrible hurry with Poseidon - everything moves at such a fast pace that the characters - and the viewers - rarely have enough time to stop for a mouthful of air. And while the movie campy fun and as suspenseful as the original 1972 Poseidon Adventure, the film is certainly short and most definitely to the point.<br /><br />In this remake you see lots of extras die as their world is turned upside down one New Year's Eve, with little warning once the "rogue wave" is sighted and heads towards the doomed luxury liner. Overcome by flooding, shorting electricity and baked by flash fires, the expendable masses yield with barely more than a shocked glimpse, hands clapped over mouths and last-minute hugs with total strangers.<br /><br />As the Disco and swimming pool, galleys and grand suites and of course the grand ballroom go belly-up, there's the bunch of heroic characters that defy the Captain and decide to head-onward and upward through the waterlogged, overturned ship in feats that call for a deep-sea suspension of disbelief. No matter, because the delectable Josh Lucas leads this eclectic, mismatched gang, and wouldn't you follow him!<br /><br />Alas, there's no Shelly Winters-like character in this version. The protagonists all come across, as rather nameless and faceless, blandness is the order of the day here. Kurt Russell plays a devoted father, and the ex-Mayor of New York, Richard Dreyfuss is lamenting being dumped by his boyfriend, Josh Lucas is a gambler and I think a fireman - which is why of course he knows the workings of the luxury liner backwards.<br /><br />Emmy Rossum, Jacinda Barrett, Mia Maestro, Mike Vogel and Kevin Dillon round at the crowd. And they all have remarkably strong lung capacity, considering how long they have to spend underwater! But it doesn't really matter who's who, or who will sink or swim because once the ship flips, character development isn't high on the list of this movie's agenda.<br /><br />Obviously the special effects are what it's all about and there's tons and tons of rushing water, exploding electrical circuits, people caught in air-conditioning shafts and being burnt to death by sudden fires - it's all big and loud and contains some expert stunt work and superb integration of digital technology.<br /><br />The direction is mostly crisp and although it all gets a bit repetitious towards the end - it also becomes hard to figure out what is going on - the film mostly works because it steps up its dramatic speed early on, and its pacing never falters.

Perhaps, by having two familiar faces, Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss, the director wants the audience to fill in the blanks about their respective characters.  Russell's is possibly an extension of the character that he played in "Backdraft" inasmuch as in this film he's a former New York firefighter turned mayor; Dreyfus is, perhaps, "Matt Hooper" from "Jaws," after the great white scared him out of the closet.  Both actors didn't seem to stretch their acting muscles much in this film.<br /><br />As far as the rest of the cast is concerned, Josh Lucas's "reformation" from professional gambler to savior of the group is almost believable, considering the predicament in which the survivors find themselves.  Though he has more lines than original "captain" Leslie Neilson, Andre Braugher doesn't get too much screen time and "goes down with the ship,"...literally.<br /><br />Because of the brevity of character development, the rest of the cast is filled out with your basic stereotypes: the single mom and son (Jacinda Barrett and Jimmy Bennett), the young couple (Emmy Rossum and Mike Vogel), the stowaway (Mia Maestro), the wise-ass (Kevin Dillon), and the noble crewman (Freddy Rodriquez).<br /><br />The special effects are indeed spectacular but more than thirty years have passed since the first film and it's logical that there would be an improvement in that area.  However, the first one benefited from having characters of whom the audience could connect.  By going "straight for the jugular" with the massive effort spent on CGI effects and stuntwork, Peterson has crafted a nice-looking package but with nothing inside.<br /><br />And even the original had a nifty John Williams' score; Klaus Bedelt's does not compare, even to his own superlative score to the hit "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl."<br /><br />The film does have one great bonus: the sinking of the ship at the film's end.  That is a most likely occurence, considering the massive damage inflicted on the ship by the "rogue wave."</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>Honestly I didn't even want to go see Poseidon because of the insanely negative reviews it got, but I went only because my boyfriend begged me to see it with him. I was lucky to have seen it on the IMAX screen, and for $15 per ticket I must say that it was worth it!<br /><br />The movie starts out with gorgeous sweeping angels with the most majestic music that berated into the wide open surface of the ocean around the cruise ship. It starts off fast and there is no sitting around and waiting for something to happen. About ten minutes into the movie I was actually pissed at myself for almost missing it and the scenes in front of my eyes went from wild to insane.<br /><br />This movie is extremely graphic to say the least. Except for some really dark war movies I have never seen people die and get hurt in so many ways to the point where the realistic portrayal knocked the wind out of my lungs. I felt as if I was there, tumbling with the ship hit by a rough wave exactly on midnight on new years ever. Watching the ship go from wild turning to being turned upside down, having the fuel leak and explode, the rooms fill with ocean water, people flying and dying right and left looked like some crazy National Geographic disaster special. I couldn't believe how hard the struggle for a small group of passengers was as they were going back to the bottom of the boat, now facing up, trying with all they had for a chance to jump into the bottomless black ocean.<br /><br />This reminded me of the Titanic, and the characters were fresh and modern, they struggled and sacrificed honor and lives, and they took us with them thorough the intestines of the ship. Kurt Russell has always been one of my favorites and his determination and strength were quite powerful in this movie as he and a group or random people reached to the ends of their sanity and physical strength to move forward. Pinocchio sure made escaping out of a whale look a lot easier then escape from the Poseidon was.<br /><br />Overall I loved this movie yet it was terrifying because it threw human mortality and fragility right in front of the viewer. I do not think I could have survived going through what these people went through and that was sad and scary. Really good movie, bit sad, bit heart warming and definitely very intense.<br /><br />And on the end note the music in the movie was staggering and breathtaking; it gave this movie such layers of depth that I got goose bumps from the first minute upon hearing it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R8LZYZR3377O.html">A1R8LZYZR3377O</a><br/><p>Big fan of the original. So, my anticipation was naturally at a peak when I was finally going to see a hopeful intergration of filmaking. I knew modern effects would be outstanding without even seeing it. I dont know why many of the reviews are putting an enphasis on that as if it wasnt expected. Yes, the old school acting was missing. There was passion in trying to escape, but the interaction of confusion, anger and pure uncertainty was not present. Fortunately, the level of fear was maintained solidly to somewhat compensate. I wasnt expecting a duplicate of the original, but a few more connections would have been nice along with a cameo or trivia point. The charactors where very thin and I believe the movie was way to short. The onset of the wave came too fast and much development was lacking in relation to the captain and his crew. Finding others in another area of the ship would have added to the film, with their eventual peril of course. Richard Dreyfus shaking off a passenger from his leg was a frightening touch, but I feel is a reflection of our current society. When "Chris" says to his girl , "I need you to tell me you love me", I thought I was watching acting from Night of the Living Dead, very empty. I thought the film was a bit overly dark at times. On the plus side the film started to get a good feel to as the water rushed in. Looking at the flipped ship was spectacular and realism took hold watching the constant electrical problems. The sound was awesome(if you have a good system). In a big scope way I was pulled in enough to enjoy the excitement . Filmmaker Peterson needed to realize that there was more then the rush to escape from the original. The rush was there and well done, but that extra of feeling the charactor and his bitterness was near nil. Works on some levels, refer to my title.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Whereas The Poseidon Adventure (the 1972 original classic) focused on the characters trying to survive the upside-down-ship-sinking disaster, this incredibly unnecessary remake merely uses its characters for a good excuse to put a lot of cool special effects together and call it a film.  To play these characters, the filmmakers assembled some of my least favorite actors in the world (e.g., Richard Dreyfuss, Kurt Russell).  Fortunately, though, the cast includes the angelic Emmy Rossum, who looks extremely good wet, I must say (especially from certain camera angles).  Josh Lucas is actually quite good in his role, although his sudden transformation from a guy who cares only about saving himself to full-fledged, selfless hero is problematic, and I guess you're supposed to pull for the kid to survive, but none of these characters really matter all that much.  You would think this kind of life-threatening ordeal would endear the characters to us, but that just doesn't happen.  Why develop characters when you can just keep blowing things up?  That seems to be the filmmakers' philosophy here.<br /><br />You already know the story.  A rogue wave comes up and knocks the cruise liner Poseidon all the way over, leaving a small group of characters to defy the captain's ill-advised instructions and head upward to try and find a way out through the bottom of the ship.  They face all kinds of deadly obstacles on their way, from rising water (duh) to live wires to flash fires and explosions, etc.  Some make it, some don't, but it's not like you actually care about any of them.  The only thing resembling a subplot involves Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), his daughter Jennifer (Emmy Rossum), and Jennifer's young suitor (Mike Vogel), who hasn't really gained the old man's trust as of yet.  Dreyfuss' character is gay for no apparent reason, and we learn next to nothing about the other main characters.  Basically, this film has the kind of script that could easily have been written on a napkin during some writer's lunch meeting with the director.<br /><br />The CGI-laded special effects are pretty good (albeit excessive), but it's just a mistake to build a film around the special effects.  I certainly appreciate the filmmakers going to so much trouble to make the climactic first few minutes of the capsizing surprisingly graphic and as real as possible, but it would have served the film well to devote some of that same passion to the weak script.  As it is, the film - like the ship itself - sinks more and more with each passing minute.</p></br><a href="../users/A37PV5GMP2ILJC.html">A37PV5GMP2ILJC</a><br/><p>They never should have meddled<br /><br />With this classic movie hit<br /><br />The first one was in '72<br /><br />I still remember it<br /><br />This one has better CGI<br /><br />But lacks the heart and soul<br /><br />Even The Love Boat had more charm<br /><br />With Gopher's goofy role<br /><br />The characters are stereotyped<br /><br />and none has got the class<br /><br />Of Shelley, Gene and Ernest<br /><br />And that Stella Stevens lass<br /><br />The ship was hit by a rogue wave<br /><br />It flipped stern over stack<br /><br />The Captain told them to be calm<br /><br />They'd all be getting back<br /><br />A little group thought otherwise<br /><br />They left to find a way<br /><br />To climb up to the bottom part<br /><br />And die another day<br /><br />The action is ongoing<br /><br />As the cast all sweat and strain<br /><br />Some parts however are a stretch<br /><br />For someone with a brain<br /><br />The dialogue is stilted<br /><br />The acting's overdone<br /><br />There IS a morning after<br /><br />But you'd better rent this one<br /><br />Rated: 3.5 stars<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 3, 2006</p></br><a href="../users/A155X6KYOPQEZ5.html">A155X6KYOPQEZ5</a><br/><p>I just got done watching this movie a couple nights ago. It was a great movie! The visual effects were outstanding and the plot and characters were awesome! It was really fun watching this movie and I highly recommend it!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I found Poseidon to be a film that had great special effects but hardly anything was done to make the characters interesting.  They just appeared there and we were expected to care about them surviving the sinking ship.<br /><br />The beginning of the film is supposed to be when we get to know and care about all the main characters, but hardly anything was done to make them worth caring about.  So when they were running towards the top of the ship in an attempt to escape the rising flood, it just wasn't that great.  I DID care about that little boy who almost didn't make it towards the end of the film.  That was a memorable segment.<br /><br />I can't deny the special effects are really good, and watching the movie on DVD is a whole other experience with the incredibly loud sounds of waves crashing against the boat and all sorts of ship destruction, but besides that, the film was pretty average and didn't tell as good a story as it probably should have.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NLZVP501JM5Z.html">A1NLZVP501JM5Z</a><br/><p>Normally in a disaster movie theres a half-hour to an hour where we meet the characters and get to know all about them.  It is necessary for the disaster scenario to have its full effect on the audiences.  But the clever writer for Poseidon had the great idea to meet the characters for about 5 or 10 minutes than have the big wave come.  Bad idea.  I did not even care about any of the characters.  By the end of the movie you don't really care anymore.  The special effects are stunning, but I expected a lot more from Wolfgang Peterson(Air Force One, Troy).  Don't pay to see this, rent it when it comes out.  If you want a good summer movie go see Mission Impossible 3.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Everyone can recall the earlier "Poseidon Adventure", released in the early 1970s and starring Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons, Shelley Winters, etc.  While the earlier version was exciting and thrilling, this new version is just as exciting and thrilling in its own right.  The special effects have improved dramatically over the past 30+ years since the original film was made, and these are the highlight of the new film.<br /><br />As for the story, the plot remains basically the same.  The SS Poseidon is on a New Year's Eve cruise when a gigantic tidal wave strikes the ship, causing it to capsize.  Instead of immediately sinking, the ship has "turned turtle", and now the hull is facing upright.  After the ship has turned over, the captain urges the surviving passengers to remain in the ballroom, because he believed an automatic distress signal has been sent and the ship should be able to remain afloat for several hours; long enough for help to arrive.  Tragically, he was wrong.<br /><br />One person not waiting around to be rescued is Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas), a professional poker player.  He immediately begins to formulate a plan to somehow make his way "up" which is really down, into the bowels of the uptuurned vessel to find a way out.  Along the way, Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), a retired firefighter and former mayor of New York City, Maggie James (Jacinda Barrett), her young son Conor (Jimmy Bennett), stowaway Elena (Mia Maestro), and Richard Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss) decide to join Dylan and search for a way out.  Robert informs the group that his daughter Jennifer (Emmy Rossum) and her fiance Christian (Mike Vogel) were in the ship's disco when the wave hit.  The group struggles their way up to the disco to rescue them.  After recovering Jennifer and Christian, the group begins a perilous climb through the bowels of the ship, all the while racing against time.  The watertight compartments have begun to fail and soon the ship is beginning to settle further in the water.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the determined group of survivors has continued to make their way through the ship, swimming through narrow passages and into vent tubes, all the while trying to avoid the onrushing flow of the sea.  Will the group make it to the bow and be able to escape through the propeller tubes, as Dylan has discovered to be a safe way out, or will they all suffer the same fate as the other passengers aboard?<br /><br />This is an exciting and thrilling movie that is topped off with eye-popping special effects and superior acting performances. Some reviewers have commented that the characters were not as developed in this movie as they were in the original film, but I would disagree.  I felt that the strong performances, especially by Kurt Russell (Robert), Josh Lucas (Dylan), and Richard Dreyfuss (Nelson) were one of the high points of the film.  I found myself easily relating to all of the characters, and I was genuinely wondering who would play the part of hero next?  Would it be Robert, who vainly tried to save the life of Elena, or would it be Dylan, who risked his own life several times to save the rest of the group?  On the contrary, I found the character development to be excellent.  The aforementioned special effects, especially the scenes with the wave striking the ship, is what really made this movie stand out from the original.<br /><br />Having viewed both movies, I feel that each deserves a high recommendation.  The original contains many famous actors, and the original storyline was developed, but this great re-make deserves its own place as one of the great "disaster" movies.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  If you're a fan of great special effects and believeable characters, then you won't want to miss this thrilling and exciting movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>Wow! I can not believe anyone could have anything good to say about this lame movie!? I must say that being a pre-teen when the original film was released, I saw this film many times at the theater. Who could resist this adventure? The young boy is one of the heroes and we get to ooggle  Pamela Sue Martin in hot pants! In the original film when Roddy McDowell ("Ackers") and Shelly Winters ("Bel") die we feel genuinely sad. When Jack Albertson ("Manny") discovers his wife of 50 years has suffered a heart attack after saving the preacher from a horrible under water death, we feel empathy for him (Albertson). I am a big fan of the original, though I must admit it has lost some steam as I've grown older. First I want to point out I have a very nice home theater with a 10 foot screen. I watched a HD version of the new film, so it had everything going for it. The remake doesn't take any time to develop the characters, so nobody cares that their lives are in danger or if they die! There is no build up to the giant wave, so there is no tension when it capsizes the ship! I also thought the special effects were NOT all that big an upgrade, if at all!  This is one of the worst remakes I have ever seen! All the acters including the stars phoned in the performances and the action sequences did not equal the sweat inducing "swim along the rope under water" sequence of the original. A complete waste of time and money! If you are going to try to remake a movie,this is the way NOT TO DO IT!</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>The most surprising aspect of this 2006 thrill ride of a movie is that at ninety minutes, it is almost a half-hour shorter than its 1972 predecessor, a blessing really given that director Wolfgang Peterson seems only interested in filming the action sequences. An inspired choice for the remake, the veteran director has already proven a sharp acumen for providing exceedingly cramped, seafaring adventures with his classic WWII submarine movie, "Das Boot" and the more recent fishing trip-gone-wrong, "The Perfect Storm". The offsetting problem, however, is that Mark Protosevich's trite screenplay abbreviates character development in favor of banal dialogue and stock responses. The net result is that there is little concern for the fate of any of the characters, especially the women who look interchangeable when soaked, no matter how dire the consequences.<br /><br />Peterson wastes little time, barely fifteen minutes, in setting up the ten key characters for the big tidal wave. From that point, he combines predictably spectacular CGI effects with outsized set pieces to dramatize the familiar journey this group takes to find their way to the hull where they seek safety. The one indisputable improvement over the original is the way Peterson effectively shows the fast elevating water level in a more realistic way, especially in having the characters swim a lot more through the submerged air shafts. Less realistic is the way all the characters appear to swim at Olympian levels in their ability to forego oxygen for lengthy periods. But the set-up gets repetitive, and the only diversion, albeit a minor one, is figuring out which character will be killed next.<br /><br />As the alpha male, Josh Lucas cuts a reasonable action figure playing the Gene Hackman hero role though a more mercenary type given that his character is a professional gambler. Relegated to second lead, Kurt Russell seems to be inheriting Ernest Borgnine's role but not as a blowhard cop but as the sensitive former mayor of New York (huh?). They argue periodically about what path to take, but that's the only relationship that has any semblance to reality in the film. With no one as colorful as Shelley Winters or Stella Stevens this time, the rest of the actors barely register, including wide-eyed Emmy Rossum playing Russell's conflicted daughter and Jacinda Barrett as the brave mother of a predictably precocious son.<br /><br />The biggest waste is the normally colorful Richard Dreyfuss cast rather pathetically as a gay, suicidal architect who barely says a word once the action starts. The climax gets quite convoluted in its technicalities, and then it simply ends. There are nine minutes of end credits at the end listing the multitudes who worked on the special effects. The two-disc 2006 DVD is strictly for aficionados of this genre of film with several "making of" featurettes and a History Channel documentary which looks at the possibility of such waves wreaking such havoc. Surprisingly, there is little reference to the 1972 inspiration directed by Ronald Neame. And consequntly, there is barely enough to hold interest over the course of two discs. An unmemorable viewing experience overall.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>DVD will automatically play movie if option has not been chosen in 2 minutes.<br />  This 2006 film is a remake of the original 1972 film, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHSVNW">The Poseidon Adventure (Special Edition)</a> (1972) released December 12, 1972.  That was followed by a sequel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H5U68Y">Beyond the Poseidon Adventure</a> (1979).  Both films included an all-star cast.<br />  When Warner Brothers Pictures announced their remake of "The Poseidon Adventure", NBC/Hallmark quickly put in to motion their version of the Possidon disaster, titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1YW22">The Poseidon Adventure (2005 TV Movie) (Full Screen Edition)</a> (2005-TV), starring Steve Guttenberg.  It was broadcast on NBC, November 20, 2005.<br />  Thus, the new motion picture version by Warner Brothers Pictures was titled, POSEIDON (2006)", released May 12 2006.<br />  So, yes, two Poseidon Adventure films were being made at the same time. One as a television movie, the other for the big movie theatre screen.<br />  This film continues the tradition with an all-star cast: Kurt Russell, Richard Dreyfuss, Josh Lucas, Kevin Dillon, Emmy Rossum, Jacinda Barrett, Freddy Rodriguez, Kirk B.R.

Those that survived will have to find a way back to the top.  However, they are standing on what was the ceiling.  The floor is way up there.  They better hurry because the below zero freezing water is about to rush in.<br /><br />None of the actors in the original 1972 film make an appearance.<br />  Shelley Winters passed away January 14, 2006 of natural causes.<br />  Red Buttons passed away July 13, 2006 of vascular disease.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>POSEIDON seems like one of Wolfgang Petersen's lesser efforts. It has nowhere near the character development or intensity of AIR FORCE ONE or DAS BOOT. The main character and hero of the piece is Josh Lucas (he got top billing). Lucas really has no screen presence in my opinion. He truly lacks that charismatic quality to qualify as a leading man and is much better suited to character roles such as exemplified by his performance in A BEAUTIFUL MIND. In POSEIDON Lucas truly is not a very good hero and in fact is something of a cad and a heel that never quite redeems himself. Lucas seems unable or unwilling to shake his annoying cocky attitude. Kurt Russell definitely has a certain admirable and likeable screen presence and is better suited for the role of the leading man hero. If you take one look at Kurt you know he can back up anything he says he can do in that department. The script unfortunately constantly refers to him as this overbearing dad who somehow has never even been able to cut it even in public office. This is unfortunate for Kurt, the film and the audience because we really want to root for someone in this film. Given this awkward role, Kurt does have his moment of pathos and one can only reflect with anguish about his career that should have been kinder and more rewarding for his great talents as an actor. The rest of the cast trying to escape just goes through the motions as a bunch of simpering and whimpering flock of sheep. That's the problem with this film. In the original there was a sense of purpose to the group of escaping passengers trying to survive. Their emotions and temperaments were characterized with a peculiar camaraderie comprised of harmony and discord but still they retained a unified purpose of survival. The original was an impressive maritime adventure especially bolstered by John Williams' haunting score conjuring up images and fears of the unknown perils that the vast and mysterious oceans still hold in our imaginations.</p></br><a href="../users/A2K3L0DOPQQ697.html">A2K3L0DOPQQ697</a><br/><p>Hollywood you better get your act together. Thanks you for spitting out another INSTANTLY forgettable "Blockbuster" Thank God I only paid $4 dollars to see this. Not only can't the Studios come up with original material. The material they remake is worse than the original. If this crap keeps up you will have even less of an audience. A good cast given nothing to chew on and a Director who has made great films and this is what we get? $150 million and the Ballroom set in the original was more impressive?<br /><br />Video games are so prevalent in society that I fear their mind numbing influence is starting to permeate even NON video game derived movies. The original movie was a good solid, involving movie. This remake takes every element of the original and removes what made it involving. I mean EVERY element. There are people out there making these decisions!! And they are paid huge sums to make these decisions! With the talent in front of and behind the camera this is truly frightening as this seems to be the norm at the present.<br /><br />Right from the start there is almost NO set up. We don't know where the ship is, where it is sailing, even what ocean it's on! Things that actually would create some atmosphere like the originals speech by the Captain explaining the origin of Poseidon. Greek God of the Sea. They are sailing on the Mediterranean, to Greece? Get it? Cheesy but involving. You know it gives the proceedings some gravatis, some mystery. In the remake we get nothing, we are are in Video game land, we don't have time for such things.<br /><br />Even the cause for the disaster has absolutely no set up. Happy new year, bang, the tidal wave hits. Unlike the originals slow build up, as it explained WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WHY! Even the effects in the original worked better. They were simpler but executed as a whole created more of an impact because of the tension that was built up. Again a sense of gravity, HUMAN INVOLVEMENT and Atmosphere! Even in the original, Leslie Nielsen's corny grimace as the wave engulfs the ship. It's goofy but you REMEMBER IT. You know a character we identify with reacting to the impending disaster. It's a very basic cinematic technique. But I guess todays more "sophisticated" audience don't need this kind of thing anymore.<br /><br />There is no human involvement in the wave hitting in this remake. The Captain isn't called to the bridge, no build up, just some crew members we've had no contact with running around. Absolutely unmemorable. The effects are impressive but who cares, I'm not given anything to latch on to.<br /><br />Straight across the board EVERY situation is diminished from the original. The scene chewing conflict between Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine is totally lost in the remake. There is NO conflict with the characters. NONE! It's just one disaster to overcome to the next. You know , like a VIDEO GAME.<br /><br />Even the self sacrificing Shelly Winters death swim has almost no emotional impact because the character doesn't return and die in front of everybody. Like DUH! Hey screen writers perhaps you should learn of something called ELEMENTS OF DRAMA!! Even if you have no talent you could at least COPY the original, not make it worse! Absolutely mind boggling!! If you WANTED to sabotage the original, you couldn't have done a better job. UNREAL! All you film lovers just keep repeating "Things will get better". Repeat it like a prayer.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>What happened to the Christmas three ?<br /><br />The main dilemma on the original movie's premise was that Gene Hackman wasn't even sure taking the survivors to the top of the ship was the right move, he couldn't even convince most of them to follow him while the remaining ones questioned every move he made. On this new version the ship turns over and the survivors just take off, no big dilemma, no bad guy to question anybody, just mindless action. Once they get off the ship a conveniently located raft and two arriving helicopters kill off any of the few, remaining sense of suspense.<br /><br />It's been 2 months since I saw this movie in a theater and I have a hard time remmembering who it was that survived and who didn't, in other words, I didn't give a damn and judging by the film's box office results, not many did.<br /><br />I find it incredible that in 2006's Hollywood, $150,000,000 can't buy you a decent remake to a film that in it's day was criticized for its cartoony characters.Compared to the 2006 version all of them (including the insufferable "where are you sis!" kid) deserved an Oscar.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>As you might expect, a blockbuster disaster movie usually lives or dies by the quality of its special effects. "Poseidon," perhaps embracing this sensibility, storms right out of the gates with its money shot, a flyby tour of the doomed ship's exterior from all angles that might be half as impressive as it sounds. The CG looks like a student reel, amateurish and fake with goofy footage of soon-to-be hero Josh Lucas jogging the upper decks awkwardly crammed in. It's a downhill slide from there as a thin plot yields to the power of impressive post-production effects to bail it out, and the cavalry never manages to arrive. A surprisingly star-studded cast struggles with one dimensional characters, banal "here's what I'm looking at" dialog and plot twists so by-the-book I was able to accurately predict each on-screen death. It's a bland, generic, cash-in of a remake that isn't even afforded the buoy of good eye candy.

I am not going to lie and say that this film would be good regardless of the budget because that, my dears would be a big fat lie ... because if this movie would'nt have spent the 150,000,000$ that it had, than this film would'nt have been good at all!

The course of the movie did not allow for any significant development.<br /><br />Moreover, the special affects and all the action are not very well tied together or simply not believable.

Er, guys, yes it is.  And a poor one at that.  The ship is like the original Terminator - every time you defeat the guy, he comes back with even more.  Unlike the Terminator, this is not entertaining - it's painful to watch.  There's so much that just does not make sense.<br /><br />1) What keeps blowing up?!?  Man, if cruise ships are *that* explosive, I'm never setting foot on one again. It's like a '70 car chase - or a Monty Python skit - where everything explodes. Radar towers, swimming pools - you name it.  It done blowed up.<br /><br />2) The bow thrusters, a critical part at the end.  They don't work like that. They could NOT work like that.<br /><br />3) The fire and water lobby scene.  How about just WALKING around?  The balconies clearly encircle the lobby.  Why dive into the fire covered water?  Same scene, the hose slide, two people, supported by a piece of brass, held on to by a couple of sweaty hands?  PLEASE!<br /><br />4) The designers never heard of GFCI's, Coast Guard regs, or standard shipbuilding practices dealing with electrical systems. This ship would never get a certification to carry passengers!<br /><br />There is just so much that's wrong with this film that it's beyond imagination.  Every scene - literally - anyone with an IQ over 80 will be thinking "What the?!?! Why do that?!? How in the hell could that happen?!? Give me a break!!!"  The director can't even decide how BIG the wave actually is.<br /><br />Promotions and CD covers show it towering over the ship.  When the captain sees it, the algle of the binocs and the proportional size would make it over 200 feet tall.  Look at our Gay Architect when he's about to jump and spots the wave. His eyes are looking at almost a 45 degree angle - and the wave is still a LONG way out.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICHEO78NFE4Y.html">A3ICHEO78NFE4Y</a><br/><p>This movie kind of proves that you can't improve on the classics.  I feel so bad, as to how bad, that i don't want to say any more bad things about this film.  It's just poor.  Get the original and rent it.  Check out the actors of yesterday against these want-to-be's.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>This film suffers in comparison to others, namely the "original", and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ANVQ0K">Titanic</a>. One wonders at the wisdom of greenlighting this project and approving a budget of $160 million. That question becomes more relevant during the opening credits. Not to disrespect either actor, but Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss are past their A-list days.<br /><br />Not only does POSEIDON suffer in comparison to other films, it suffers from filmmakers more concerned with a visual product than any other components. For main characters, we're given a group that you could pluck down in just about any thriller and watch them run with little or no guidance: in other words, they're stock characters. We've seen them hundreds of times: the former fire-fighter turned Mayor turned wealthy gambler, the former navy guy who can navigate his way through a ship that's turned upside down with remarkable pinpoint accuracy, the gay man with a can't-miss-it-sized earring in his right ear who's there just to be gay, a single mother with a young cute son who makes endearing comments and looks just so, the mayor's daughter who is nervous around him for no apparent reason, and the guy who wants the mayor's daughter to marry him who calls him sir. Nothing new here.<br /><br />What was surprising, however, was that the filmmakers approached POSEIDON with a take-no-prisoners attitude. Everyone's life was up for grabs, and I mean everyone's. They killed off one of their initial main characters almost immediately, and that set up the possibility of real tension. Without having done that, this film would have been a waste.<br /><br />But a film can't build a reputation by having great special effects and killing people indiscriminately. It needs a story, a plot, people that we care about so that when they die we care...and this just didn't have it.<br /><br />2? stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>The movie itself is pretty much an empty vessel, though it is certainly a product of its time. Trivial concerns such as story and character are jettisoned in favor of elaborate and expensive sets and CGI special effects. Like so many CGI blockbusters, human interaction is merely a bothersome detail; the real focus being on the violent extermination of masses of nameless, faceless victims. And once again, Hollywood has mistaken technological gimmickry for storytelling skill. When the film does try to escape from tired predictability it bites off for more than it can chew.<br /><br />The capsizing sequence was stunning, but so many areas of the ship were highlighted in such a short time that I never really felt I was part of the action. We witness the galley bursting into flames and everybody being burnt to a crispy critter. Elevators come crashing down, people are falling and dying all over the place, dead bodies float all throughout the ship and outside the ship, and it's one big mess. There was no Christmas tree!?! The Christmas tree played a pivotal role in the original film ... from passengers falling into it during the capsizing ... to it unexpectedly crashing down ... to the survivors climbing it (and Mrs. Rosen getting stuck in the spokes) ... to it falling back into the flooding Dining Room when panic ensues! Why leave it out entirely when there are so many cinematic possibilities? Instead the characters in the new film "sneak out" of the Ballroom using some stacked chairs. There is absolutely no plea for others to join them even though they know that anyone left behind may die. I suppose it says something about today's society ... "I'm getting out of here -- to hell with everyone else!" But these guys are supposed to be the heroes in the film? The film has no sense of humanity, let alone a sense of humor about the absurdity of the entire premise.<br /><br />I suppose that the filmmakers wanted this to be like the remake of KING KONG, an eye-popping, special effects reinvention of a well-worn story. But, instead, POSEIDON ends up being like the woefully unnecessary remake of PSYCHO: there was no need, demand or purpose for this film to exist and the filmmakers reveal they have no apparent clue as to why the original is loved in the first place. That's what happens when you set sail without a compass; you just get lost at sea.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>It's New Year's Eve aboard the cruise ship Poseidon, and the revelers in the ballroom are unaware that a "rogue wave" is headed their way.  But first, we meet the unsuspecting partygoers:  Father (Kurt Russell) and daughter (Emmy Rossum), handsome and conceited gambler (Josh Lucas), single mom and her small son, and rich but depressed businessman (Richard Dreyfuss).  The surprise wave turns the ship over, there are countless causalities, but who will survive the climb to the top, er, bottom?<br /><br />Comparisons with the Irwin Allen original are natural, but they really are very different movies.  The 1972 version was character-driven.  We knew a lot about the personalities and histories of the main cast and cared about them.  There was a lot of inter-personal drama that was quite enjoyable and special effects were limited to the upside-down roll of the ship.  The new "Poseidon" is all about the CGI effects, and they are truly outstanding.  The flipping of the ship is much more violent and realistic this time around, and it's just the start of the action.  And there are enough underwater scenes to have you holding your own breath as you are caught up in the excitement.  We know almost nothing about the characters, but that didn't bother me as the star of the show is the explosive action.<br /><br />The director maintains a high level of tension throughout the film; the danger never lets up, and the pace is quick.  We know some of the cast won't survive, but we don't know who, and that keeps us involved.  (I was surprised no one said, "Let's climb to the bottom of the ship and get out that way; you know, like they did in "The Poseidon Adventure"!)  Action fans will surely enjoy this non-stop thrill ride.

A rethinking(that's all i can call it because it is so different) in this day and age isn't that bad an idea. This one is better than most of the retreads we have had of late (Planet Of The Apes, Gone In 60 Seconds, and the endless T.V. show remakes come to mind), and that makes this one worth the price. The c.g.i. fx's are great and the action is first rate. Sure the story has holes(so did the 1972 version) and the people are cardboard cut outs( though well played by Kurt Russell, Josh Lucus, Richard Dreyfuss, and Kevin Dillon as the jerk that you can't wait for him to die) , but it all works under Wolfgang Petersen's direction. The warning about the level of violence is well worth stateing again, people die very "mean" deaths and in full view of the camera, so if you are disturbed by this beware!!! Other wise, relax, sit back and watch an adventure unfold "in an upside down hell under the sea"</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>The spotlight review by "G-Man" above is very accurate and well-written.  I can't add much to it, but I'll try.<br /><br />I think this is an extremely well made remake of a  classic.  I've always been a big fan of Kurt Russell and think he's never given enough credit for his versatile acting skills.  He makes a good leader without being arrogrant or bossy.  In addition, Josh Lucas (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B8IA44">Stealth</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EXZFCQ">Glory Road</a>) makes a great reluctant hero.  Of course, Emmy Rossum of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007TKNL0">The Phantom of the Opera</a> fame is always a pleasure to watch along with Richard Dryfuss whom we all learned to love in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9G">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008KLVG4">Jaws</a> back in the '70's.  The acting is all very convincing as is most of the dialogue and sets.<br /><br />The special effects are not groundbreaking, but they are extraordinary and very believable.  They definitely have the "WOW!" factor even though we have seen these types of effects before (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXJD">The Perfect Storm</a>), only here they are better.<br /><br />This film is worth owning and stands much more on it's own rather than as a simple remake.  It's noteworthy that the two leaders played by Lucas and Russell work together rather than against each other as the two main characters (played by Hackman and Borgnine) did in the original film (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHSVNW">The Poseidon Adventure</a>).<br /><br />The "Special Features" are definitely worth viewing on the two-disc set "Special Edition" package.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Summer pickings for movies this year is amazingly slim, explaining why perhaps more people are being drawn to the DVD release of Wolfgang Peterson's clunker POSEIDON that the quality of the product deserves.

And I'm not all that fond of water.  So it was inevitable that I would see Poseidon, a movie that must be witnessed on the big screen for the full effect.<br /><br />Everyone knows the story by now: Poseidon, a massive cruise liner, flips over when a "rogue wave" strikes during a New Year's Eve celebration.  Just about every passenger is gathered in the grand ballroom, although the youngsters are also celebrating in one of the (invariably many) nightclubs on the ship.  And just like that, their world is literally turned upside down.<br /><br />Our hero is the professional gambler, Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas).  Rugged, shifty, and a little too smooth for his own good, Dylan is an ex-Navy man who lost his moral center.  He finally meets a woman seemingly immune to his charms in the form of Maggie James (Jacinda Barrett) and her son Conor (Jimmy Bennett).  What's a lovable rogue to do?<br /><br />One of those rich folks that Dylan separates from their money is Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), a former New York City mayor and ex-fireman.  His daughter Jennifer (Emmy Rossum) struggles for her independence with her boyfriend Christian (Mike Vogel). There's also the lovelorn Richard Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss) who is considering killing himself, and the secret couple of Marco Valentin (Freddy Rodriguez) who smuggles aboard Elena Gonzalez (Mia Maestro). And how could we forget one-note Lucky Larry (Kevin Dillon)!<br /><br />While the ship's captain, Michael Bradford (Andre Braugher) advises that everyone stay in the ballroom, Dylan has other plans.  He leads Maggie, Conor, Robert, Richard, and Marco to find his daughter in the nightclub.  Facing their own struggles to survive in the nightclub are Jennifer, Christian, Elena and yes...Lucky Larry.<br /><br />I don't remember the original Poseidon Adventure very well, but it was a very detached experience, much less horror and much more of a character study.  Fortunately, director Wolfgang Petersen isn't interested in showing how good an actor can mime hysterics.  Instead, he goes for the throat; this is a disaster film and it looks like it: dead bodies float everywhere.  When the ship flips, everything flips with it, and we can never forget that our protagonists are upside-down because every sign, door, and table is the wrong way.  And then there's the water.<br /><br />Gurgling, growling, snaking through shafts, suffused with flames; water has never been so terrifying.  The survivors must swim through a conflagration, in the dark, through a nettle of wires, past floating dead bodies, and at one point, hold their breath to the breaking point.  It is horrible.  It is undoubtedly realistic.  It is a disaster movie with a capital D.<br /><br />Throughout, there are little bits of humor that help relieve the tension.  I mean, there's a guy named Lucky Larry for crying out loud!  Conversely, Poseidon is deadly serious about the plight of its characters, and the survivors must make a host of moral choices that force us to ask: faced with survival or death, would we make the same decisions and sacrifices?<br /><br />Disaster movies are in a particular quandary these days.  It's no longer sufficient to pretend that we're watching a make believe event that can happen to fictional people.  Always lurking in the back of our minds is the possibility that whatever disaster we're witnessing could happen to us...or happened recently.  When is a movie about a disaster appropriate?<br /><br />The answer is that there is no appropriate timing for a film.  I think releasing Poseidon on May Day was an inspired choice.  It's our reaction to it that moviegoers must ultimately decide for themselves.  If the film disturbs you...then perhaps that was the point.<br /><br />If you're ready for a wild ride, if you've ever been afraid of water, or if you always wondered what nature thinks of big floating cities in her oceans...see Poseidon.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: Wolfgang Petersen has been a pretty consistent director when it comes to big bombastic CGI driven movies. He has never really made an excellent film, but he has done good work.  The Perfect Storm was a good story and handled very well, while Air Force One was an intense thriller that had all the right ingrediants to work so well. Troy was considered by many to be a bad movie, but I found it to have a great vision on Petersen's part that resulted in a very enjoyable blockbuster. Now Wolfgang Petersen hits the screen with his next blockbuster wannabe, Poseidon. A remake of the 1972 The Poseidon Adventure. Nothing new to report here, but remakes never capture the essence of the originals, it just seems like a fact that Hollywood doesn't care about. The film tells the disasterous tale of a cruise ship that gets hit by a rogue wave in the middle of the ocean, and that's about it. The film is a short 1 hour, 48 minutes. Short in terms of movies in the same genre. The script is contrived and full of cardboard characters and wooden dialogue. It's nothing but one clich? after another and just makes excuses to show more amazing CGI and "been there, done that" escape sequences. Sure the movie has incredible CGI and some amazing set design, but at what cost? My rule of thumb is that you cannot sacrifice story for action, which is just what this movie did. The dialogue and the characters were merely lead-ins to the next action sequence. No character development was done, which basically says "okay, don't care about the characters, just watch this ship rollover." Mark Protosevich was the film's screenwriter, and this is only his second screenplay, which shows his lack of experience and really his screenplay is the thorn in this movie's side. Petersen does a great job at directing the action, William Sandell's (Master & Commander) production design is spectacular, and Klaus Badelt's score is intense and in your face. However it is the script, the backbone of a film, that is lacking and thus creates a very lackluster experience.<br /><br />ACTING: When you hear a cast listing like this movie has, you have certain expectations. There is some great talent in the film, but what can you say about the acting if the script is horrible. Some of the lines that are delivered are laughably bad. In one scene Josh Lucas tells Kurt Russell who is a former firefighter, "I work better on my own . . . no offense". In which Russell replies, "None taken". You can't get much better than that.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Is it clich?d? Yes. Has it been done before? Many times. Do we care about the characters? No. However, you can't help but feel a little entertained by the overwritten score by Klaus Badelt and the bombastic CGI scenes as the ship turns belly up. It'll be a good DVD to give your home theater a workout.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>I didn't bother seeing this movie in the theatres since I'd heard so much negative word-of-mouth about it from the few people I knew who saw it.  I've always been a huge fan of the original THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE ('72) and still watch it every New Year's Eve the way some people will watch IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE for Christmas.<br /><br />But I did buy the 2-disc DVD.  Part of the reason for justifying this was that I was buying the extras, especially a documentary from the History Channel about rogue waves.<br /><br />As far as the movie goes, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be...but that's hardly an enthusiastic "thumbs up" either.  I kept thinking Roger Ebert's word to sum it up: "perfunctory."  That works for me.<br /><br />It's as if Hollywood has taken the screenwriting process away from the writers and handed it over to the folks who design amusement park rides.<br /><br />Movies are now calculated to rush your senses and ignore your inner organs...like your brain and your heart.  Just keep those pupils dilating and reflexes jumping.<br /><br />My biggest major beef with POSEIDON was the movie's choice to jettison what I felt was the coolest aspect of the original: it wasn't just a survival story, it was a metaphor for Life itself.<br /><br />The original film said, "In an upside-down world, a rebellious religious leader leads a small group of believers UP while everyone else is going DOWN."<br /><br />The remake says, "We're just going to whack people every few mintues--but, man, it's gonna look so cool!"<br /><br />THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE told its story and its appeal has lasted over thirty-five years (and will live on).<br /><br />POSEIDON hit DVD three months after its release and will probably be piled in a clearance bin by the end of this year.<br /><br />Will Hollywood figure it out?  I doubt it.<br /><br />I don't blame the actors (like a lot of reviews here) because it all comes down to writing, writing, writing.<br /><br />I didn't care about any of these characters.  Not a one.  Think about the way the audience felt when a character died in the original (especially Gene Hackman's powerful scene of losing Mrs. Rosen).  POSEIDON never worked on that level.<br /><br />The music biz made a big deal that Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas has a cameo...but I thought she looked and sounded like Charo--coochie, coochie! (Talk about a bad Love Boat flashback!).<br /><br />The special effects provided some good moments, especially the sequence of the tidal wave capsizing the ship.  As usual, the only good thing Hollywood films these days can be praised for are their special effects...and little else.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the original, CHECK IT OUT.  I've talked to a lot of young people who haven't seen it and didn't feel like watching the same movie again.<br /><br />I tell them two things:<br /><br />Even if you saw POSEIDON, then you didn't see THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE.<br /><br />And, yes, it's in color.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>You know the story. A cruise ship turns upside down due to a rogue wave. Everyone now walks on ceilings, and the only way out of here is to travel upwards until the bottom of the ship (technically the top of the now-sunken ship) is reached. I've seen both the original 1972 version and this new 2006 remake, and I have to say that I prefer the original. Poseidon isn't really terrible, but it has plenty of faults. The acting is poor, the characters are unlikable, and the dialogue feels forced. The special effects, however, are much better than the effects in the original. There is a lot of computer effects that almost look real.<br /><br />I guess you can say that I found this to be an adequate film overall. It doesn't live up to the original, but it's worth it if you're looking for a standard popcorn movie.<br /><br />Grade: 5.8/10</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Poseidon is by no means a great movie (though neither was the original, if it comes to that) but it's fun and quick-moving and showcases some nifty special effects.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>The original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHSVNW">Poseidon Adventure</a> was Irwin Allen in his disaster film best...ensemble acting with a tragedy to work through. He worked that formula like no-one else...so when Wolfgang Petersen went to remake it, he did what he should have. He scrapped what Allen was magic at and inserted his own strength in their place. Which meant characters that might not be the most interesting, but working as a team to overcome the odds (think <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767802470">Das Boot</a>).<br /><br />To that end, his "Poseidon" is a faster paced, tighter and shorter movie than Allen's and moves at such a tear that it's hard to notice when it falters. The cast is helmed by Kurt Russell (playing troubled macho as only he can), Josh Lucas (loner gambler subbing for Gene Hackman's loner priest) and Richard Dreyfuss (gay man just jilted by his ex for a younger man). Along with seven other survivors, this group must battle fire, water and the clock to climb up the ship to safety.<br /><br />Minus the 3-dimensional characters, Petersen gives us a 3-dimensional ship. The effects are a marvel (the bonus disc shows you just how few CGI effects were used) and the opening wave scene is visceral in its blunt force. The capsizing boat, with the ensuing death and the mayhem, will scare the saltwater out of you. Maybe even more so than some horror movies. Little time is wasted between survival episodes, although the nod to Shelly Winters' swim team dialog from the original is a nice touch. The survivors overcome obstacle after peril and each more tense than the last.<br /><br />There is, naturally, a happy ending. Just who makes it out and how is the fun of "Poseidon." Once it's over, make sure to watch the DVD extras, with the Crew Diary being interesting and the Special Effects feature fascinating.</p></br><a href="../users/AMP7TQRWAIE84.html">AMP7TQRWAIE84</a><br/><p>?????????????????????<br /><br />?????????????????????<br /><br />?????????????????????<br /><br />?????????????????????<br /><br />?????????????????????<br /><br />NO, it's NOT, THANK G O D !<br /><br />Yes, for what it was Titanic is a classic and then some. Great movie, we saw it 100+ times and we DON'T wanna go back! Wanna know why? Cause besides the fact that there were far more deaths on Titanic (more tragic), Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't in this and that there is one maybe two main characters you'll actually recognize in this one (I recognized Kurt Russell only), this movie was FAR BETTER in EVERY OTHER WAY.<br /><br />Who cares that Titanic had a better orchestra, we're here to see the action: People dying, surviving and overcoming tragic occurrences and once the boat starts to capsize, sink and fill with deathly water, the action truly never stops. If anything, it slows down, but NEVER stops, TRUST IN ME.<br /><br />The characters were pretty good. I won't say who died but I will say that I won't be surprised if someone who's watching with you (if you're not a movie loner) sheds a tear or starts to seriously ball before the very end.<br /><br />The people involved in this tiny tragedy were pretty expressive, especially the females. When Kurt Russell went back to stop the propeller fans that stood in the way of true freedom instead of his daughter's husband/boyfriend/fiancee, his daughter began to sulk. And when it took a while for him to come back (does he come back? Find out!) she broke down and I did too. I shed a small tear out my right eye as I felt half as bad as she did at the time.

Sometimes these remakes prove to be inferior to their source material ("Psycho" and "The Omen" to name a couple), but in some instances they become equals to the originals, or even better than the original.  A very recent addition to the ever-increasing list of remakes would be director Wolfgang Peterson's ("Air Force One" and "Troy") attempt at remaking the classic disaster-type film "Poseidon Adventure" with "Poseidon" starring Kurt Russell, Josh Lucas, and Richard Dreyfuss.<br /><br />"Poseidon" takes place during New Year's Eve on the cruise ship Poseidon (hmm, I wonder where they got the title of the movie from).  While the many passengers on the ship are partying the night away to welcome in the New Year, disaster is quickly approaching.  A giant wave, apparently called a rogue wave, strikes the ship, causing it to flip over and many passengers to die in the disastrous process.  With time running out, and the ship slowly becoming a watery grave for all aboard, a small group of passengers struggle to make their way to the bottom of the ship (which is now the top for those not paying attention), and hope to survive.<br /><br />Remaking a movie would seem to be somewhat difficult to me, because you have to try to present a story that has already been done before in a similar manner, while giving the audience something new and engaging to witness.  Some directors have been less original with their remakes, opting to merely copy the source movie scene for scene and word for word, merely updating the surroundings a little bit, of course I don't feel these movies do as well, but that's just me.  Now, I never saw the original "Poseidon Adventure", so I can't say how much of a copy this version is, but even if this remake is merely a scene for scene recreation of the original, I believe it is one of the rare successes that had been achieved this way.<br /><br />The success of "Poseidon" is achieved in part because of the terrific special and practical effects that were employed to make the scenes of the ship being struck by the wave into reality, and for all the disastrous side effects that followed throughout the flipped over ship.  The other part of this movie's success is due to the excellent group of actors that were assembled to fight to survive the sinking cruise ship.  All of the actors did an excellent job with fleshing out these characters over the course of the movie, because there wasn't much time given in the beginning for exposition or development.  I personally felt that the lack of character development prior to the wave striking (which occurs approximately 25 minutes into the movie, providing enough time to basically introduce the characters) was somewhat strange, because you didn't know who to root for, other than by going off whether or not you knew the actor from previous movies and if you liked them or not.  However, once the struggle for survival arc of the movie kicked in, the actors were given more to work with and developed their characters through their interaction with each other allowing them to become more accessible to the audience.<br /><br />The decision to focus the movie on the disaster side of the story early on was an odd choice, but one that worked to the film's advantage, by allowing things to get moving quickly and not allow for a lull in the momentum.  Featuring a rather short running time for a disaster movie, at just 98 minutes, a fact that may seem odd for a Wolfgang Peterson film (his movies generally last 2 hours or more), in this instance the shorter running time made for a much tighter feeling movie which served the story well.  "Poseidon" is a definite must-see among disaster films and one that will keep you on the edge of your seats until the final credits roll.<br /><br />"Poseidon" is rated PG-13 for brief language and peril.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>The most predictable of last year's box-office bombs, Poseidon was always on a hiding to nothing: a remake of the much-loved but frankly not that good blockbuster that kickstarted the 70s disaster movie trend, arriving a year after a reviled TV miniseries version, showing all the signs of burning cash as it was rushed through production to meet a summer release date (it looks like it cost $80m but cost nearer twice as much despite the less than stellar cast) and coming in at a very slim 98-minutes (twelve of them credits) was always going to be facing too many negative waves. Perhaps someone at Warners should have remembered what happened the last time they boarded the Poseidon with Irwin Allen's disastrous sequel to the original, Beyond the Poseidon Adventure, which sank with all hands. Naturally, this isn't anywhere near as bad.<br /><br />Always having been disappointed with the 1972 version, I must admit I didn't find this nearly as bad as others did and probably enjoyed it more despite its many obvious failings. To be fair the much-criticized lack of characterization isn't a major issue here since the wave hits at roughly the same point in the running time as the original, which relied on the audience identifying with recognisable stars in clich&eacute;d roles rather than quality writing, although it's a film that's in too much of a hurry to work as well as it could. The pacing definitely is a problem, with some scenes not allowed long enough to establish any real tension before amping up: it's definitely a film in a hurry, whether due to re-editing (not particularly readily apparent, to be fair) or a desire to give the film a sense of urgency. It's not one of Petersen's better jobs of direction - better than The Perfect Storm or Air Force One, not as good as Troy or Das Boot - and the CGI is variable - many of the most criticized shots are pretty decent, while it's often the explosions that convince the least - but it throws in a couple of surprises (including one surprisingly brutal moment in an elevator shaft), has a much better than expected supporting turn from Richard Dreyfuss who steals what few acting honors are going and is much more enjoyable than I was expecting.<br /><br />For a two-disc set, the extras are pretty light - aside from the 22-minute featurette and trailer on disc one, the extras on the second disc barely clock over an hour, with the half-hour documentary on Rogue Waves the clear winner.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JYIDH7JIG48H.html">A2JYIDH7JIG48H</a><br/><p>While some of the special effects are better, at least during the brief capsizing sequence, Poseidon is in no other way as good as Irwin Allen's Poseidon Adventure.  That earlier version was far more faithful to Paul Galico's novel, and part of the appeal was the all star cast giving Oscar-winning performances.  In this new exploitation, they've left out many important characters and updated the script with political "correctness," leaving out, for instance, all references to religion.  This would be tolerable if they'd improved the story in some way, but they've added nothing original or imaginative, the plot's predictable, characters stereotyped, and it just seems like an action movie knock-off rather than "adventure," so no wonder they dropped that word from the title.</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>I must admit, I've only seen bits and pieces of the original movie but this remake looked like a good adventure film so I decided to give it a try.  What I found was a really good thrill ride and its a pity that it hasn't done better at the box office!<br /><br />The director doesn't give us much time to blink before the rogue wave hits the huge cruise ship, killing a great deal of the passengers and turning the ship completely upside down.  The survivors, a small group who decide to try and find a way out of the ship, face one challenge after another.  You might think that the action would let up once the ship has been hit, but you would be wrong.  Wolfgang Peterson quicks the action rolling until the end of the movie.<br /><br />The movie is full of stars---Kurt Russell, Emmy Rossum, and Richard Dreyfess, to name a few but the best action hero of the bunch is Josh Lucas, who gets the most harrowing sequences in the film.  The special effects are really good, especially as the wave hits the Poseidon as well as some of the shots inside the ship as it rolls over in the water.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good popcorn movie with lots of action, this is one to see!  Not all movies have to have great plots or Oscar caliber acting to be enjoyed.  Sometimes you just need to sit back and enjoy the ride!  Don't let this one slip out of theaters before you see it on the big screen.  Well worth admission!</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed Poseidon. So much so, that during a particularly thrilling sequence in the middle of the movie, in which all the characters are racing up a very tight air conditioner vent to avoid the rising water, that I almost vomitted. Perhaps it had to do with the massive amount of popcorn I inhaled during the previews. Nonetheless, the movie was extremely thrilling and I had such a blast, a bigger blast than watching The Da Vinci Code (which was less thriller and more mystery). I love to begin the summer movie season with an excellent thriller!!<br /><br />Poseidon boasts an all-star cast, including Kurt Russell, Emmy Rossum, and the heartthrob Josh Lucas, incredible special effects, and decent performances all around. Here's the story, in short, a giant wave crashes into a luxury oceanliner, killing everyone on board, except a precious few who defy captain's orders and manage to wriggle and run their way through the destroyed, and upside down floating, oceanliner. Each character is key in some way, performing a "thank God we have this person on board" action at some point during the movie.<br /><br />When the captain spies that giant wave coming at the cruiseliner, you'll instantly grab your seat in shock and awe. Because it's a giant wave. And it's much more impressive this time around than in the original. In comparison to the new version, the original is, well, dull and slow, with crappy special effects, and sappy perfomances. This Poseidon is a much better effort, and you won't be sorry that you went to see it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1KMG1AIUS00DC.html">A1KMG1AIUS00DC</a><br/><p>With a movie like "Poseidon," the first question to ask is "Why did they bother to remake this?"  The similarly titled 1972 all-star disaster epic was, after all, the definitive cinematic statement on phantom waves that turn an ocean liner upside down in the middle of the ocean.  But ever in the pursuit of quick bucks, Hollywood decided that remaking a film with a tweaked screenplay was more cost-efficient than commissioning a brand new script.<br /><br /> "Poseidon" is not a terrible film.  It's just a ho-hum, predictable one.  As you watch, you know that almost everyone aboard the massive ship will die horrible deaths, a small group will reach temporary safety only to expire along the way, while a few will make it to the final credits.  Therein, I guess, lies the suspense.  When "The Poseidon Adventure" was made thirty-four years ago, the filmmakers depended on elaborate, upside-down sets and huge miniatures to suggest the topsy-turvy disaster that unexpectedly befalls a cruise ship on New Year's Eve.  It was quite an impressive picture with some beloved old-timers in featured roles and, in the era of the big-budget disaster film, racked up a fortune at the box office.<br /><br /> The cast of characters is different this time around, but still registers "generic."  There's the suicidal businessman (Richard Dreyfuss) whose dive into the ocean to kill himself is interrupted by an enormous wave bearing down on the ship.  Rather than let the wave finish what he started out to do, he retreats into the grand ballroom.  There's the overly self-assured ship's captain (Andre Braugher) who assures the survivors that they are perfectly safe in the ballroom, which is waterproof and air tight.  This is a clear signal that those folks are doomed.<br /><br /> There's  former big city mayor Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), the overprotective father of Jennifer (Emmy Rossum), who is in love with hunk Christian (Mike Vogel).  Rounding out the roster of characters are an obnoxious passenger (Kevin Dillon), a waiter who serves as a guide through the ship (Freddy Rodriguez), a pretty stowaway (Mia Maestro), and Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas), a gambler who makes a living playing high-stakes poker on cruise ships.<br /><br /> Dylan, the apparent main character, musters his little group together and leads them through all sorts of danger in a hopeful attempt to reach the bottom -- now the top -- of the ship to safety.  Navigating the narrow passageways, elevator shafts, air ducts, and ballast tanks proves tough going as fears and tensions mount.  But there is never real concern for these folks, who are on hand simply to picked off by the ravages of water, fire, and heavy machinery.<br /><br /> Like "Mission Impossible III," "Poseidon" offers no surprises.  It is a well crafted movie whose special effects must have cost considerably more than the collective price tag for talent.  Digital technology makes anything possible, but we are at the point when we are no longer blown away by an obviously digitally-rendered shot.  The opening, uninterrupted shot of the Poseidon is an example.  The camera views the ship from the starboard side at water level, sweeps up and across the bow of the ship to port, where it rises to deck level, glides along toward the back of the ship, tracks into a jogging Josh Lucas, then continues its overview of the ship, winding up viewing it from aft.  Five years ago this would have blown audiences away.  Now, however, it doesn't register as anything special.<br /><br /> What is missed most in this remake is the aging Shelley Winters, who stole the original film with the scene in which she swims underwater to help her comrades continue their escape to safety.  No longer the svelte ingenue of "A Place in the Sun," Winters unashamedly swam like a whale, giving new meaning to service above and beyond the call of duty.  In "Poseidon," Lucas's Dylan dives daredevil-like through water blazing with a coat of oil.  Though more dangerous, perhaps, than Winters' feat in the earlier film, it pales in dramatic impact.<br /><br /> "Poseidon" looks more like a made-for-TV film than a big-screen effort.  Its second-tier collection of actors and its over-familiarity make it hardly worth adding it to your "Must See" list.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>Disaster flicks were in their heyday during the 1970s.  Before the days of computerized visual effects, the big disaster films at times dazzled with what seemed to be impossible visuals and generated guffaws with some very cheesy effects.  Their fans loved all of it because they never took themselves seriously and it was more like a ride at an amusement park than anything like real life.  Even being scared was about having fun.<br /><br />This remake of the original "Poseidon Adventure" is much more serious in its intent.  Of course, the computer graphics make the images seem incredibly real and that does draw us in.  We think we feel the heat from the fires, the chill of the water, the panic of being trapped in the vents, our lungs burn for air as we swim underwater with the characters in the movie.<br /><br />We don't get the same characters that were in the first movie.  I won't discuss how the roles map or don't map onto each other, but I will say that in making all this more real, the director and writers made the people less distinguishable from each other.  Sometimes it is hard to tell who it is that is crying or screaming or whatever.<br /><br />Kurt Russell is terrific as Robert Ramsey, former fireman, former mayor of New York.  I think he is a widower, because he has no wife, but I don't remember that being explained amid all the noise.  He is on a cruise with his daughter, Jennifer (Emmy Rossum), and her boyfriend / fianc&eacute;e, Christian (Mike Vogel).  As always, there is tension between the father and daughter and the potential son-in-law (at the beginning of the film, the dad doesn't know how far along their intentions to get married are).<br /><br />Josh Lucas plays the mysterious Dylan Johns.  Since learning about this guys is a very interesting part of the movie, I don't want to discuss the character or what he does.  However, I do want to say that I loved seeing Andre Braugher on screen as Captain Bradford.  He plays the role with just the right amount of authority that an officer needs to lead people, especially in an incredible disaster.  Braugher also plays Bradford with enough humanity to endear him to us.<br /><br />The rest of the cast I will leave you to discover.  While they aren't as vividly drawn as they are in the first film, they are more compatible with the apparent desire to make such an impossible system seem more "real".<br /><br />While the comments I heard when the movie came out indicated to me that the film wasn't worth seeing, I think it more worthwhile than I had thought.  However, you have to take it for what it is.  It isn't "serious" (and who needs that all the time), and it isn't "real", but it is a good couple of hours of adventure.</p></br><a href="../users/A239PPUVV8O0U0.html">A239PPUVV8O0U0</a><br/><p>The original, with its enaging human emotions and riveting action, was a huge success, is now a classic and is considered one of, if not the best, of the disaster genre. Knowing the only reason Warner Bros. would even bother remaking it, this was a sinker (no pun intended). I didn't care who died and who lived. In fact I wanted everyone to die, there being no human connection for me to even see them survive. When they cut back to Fergie and the captain right before the ball room floods, I hadn't seen them (though minor players anyway) in so long, I thought they were dead already. All the characters are brushed over and after fifteen minutes, the wave hits the ship. While Elena (or however you spell her name) does have good motivation to survive, that motivation is revealed to late into the movie so I'm not that phased when she dies. I have a sinking feeling that, while good actors in other films, Kurt Russell (his sacrifice didn't move me at all compared to Gene Hackman's) and Richard Dryefuss only did this one for the paycheck. The one character that wished would die throughout the whole picture was the little boy. He annoyed the crap out of me to the point where ever time he talked, I said "Shut up kid!" I know in the original there was a kid, but he was actually useful and was the one who suggested the go to the engine room. The music is dull and listless and we are pained to endure not one, but TWO songs by Fergie. All in all, a very disappointing film which makes the sequel to the original feel like Gone with the Wind. Here's hoping they don't intend to remake The Towering Inferno.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>This remake from 2006 stars Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss. You've got an elegant cruise liner, a diverse cast of characters, and suddenly a rogue wave tips the whole thing over. Most of the survivors huddle in the main dining room - but a small group of passengers decide to make it out on their own.<br /><br />It's hard to judge this film just as a "stand alone disaster flick" since the 1972 version was so spectacular. It's sort of like if you really loved the Titanic with Leonardo - and then watched an action-adventure movie made now, that was half as long and truncated the characters. It would be really hard not to compare the two. So there are probably two types of watchers for this movie. One will be the people who saw the 1972 version and who are probably disappointed with this one as a result. On the other hand, people who watch this movie without any expectations, and just want a "wild ride for 1 1/2 hours" will find the special effects quite thrilling.<br /><br />Part of what this story is about is how a wide variety of characters - young boy, just-engaged couple, stowaway, older homosexual, etc. - manage to get over their issues and bond and get through troubles. Again if you're just looking for a "wild ride" won't care that these people are very stereotypical and cardboard cutout types. If you're actually a fan of drama movies where the characters grow and learn and reach into their inner strengths, you'll find this a poor version of that earlier film.<br /><br />On the other hand, part of any disaster movie is the excitement and reality of the disaster. A lava disaster movie seems hokey when they are running from "red water". When the lava is roiling, the heat waves are filling the screen and the smoke is thick, suddenly you can feel the panic and the danger. That is why we watch disaster movies - to watch people face dangers, and their fears, and hopefully rise above them. It gives us hope and encouragement that we might do the same.<br /><br />So while the 1972 version of Poseidon had some rather silly scenes of water and flood, this 2006 version does a GREAT job with many of the scenes. The way the water bursts through the windows, the way the ship is affected as it tilts upside down, it all feels very real. After the footage and experience of the Tsunami, it definitely feels real and scary to have a gigantic wave of water coming at you with nowhere to run to. You can also understand the panic of being in a submerged vessel that is sinking.<br /><br />There are numerous plot holes and factual errors, that if you're even half paying attention, make you lose your suspension of disbelief. I suppose it's that way with many disaster films - you have to just accept that they did things A and B even though doing C makes MUCH more sense to any sane person. Also, you would have thought that people working on a high budget film involving a ship would have made sure that all their basic research about how a ship works, how the ballast works, how the propeller works, etc. was correct.<br /><br />Still, in the end, you probably watch this film because it's a fun way to pass an hour and a half with your popcorn and soda. So in that sense, the movie suits that purpose, and is well worth a watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U360OMVQRPUB.html">A1U360OMVQRPUB</a><br/><p>Everyone knows the story of the POSEIDON.  This is only the third movie to bear the name and be based (loosely) on Paul Gallico's novel, THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE.  There was also a sequel to the original diaster film made by Irwin Allen that starred Ernest Borgnine and Shelly Winters and a ton of others that went on to be major stars.<br /><br />This version offers Kurt Russell, Richard Dreyfuss, Emmy Rossum, Jacinda Barrett, Mike Vogel, Mia Maestro, Jimmy Bennett, and Andre Braugher.  Unfortunately, it only features the actors and actresses in roles that you can understand at a glance.  There are no real characters here, no sense of history.<br /><br />What you do get is a knuckle-buster of an adrenaline-soaked movie.  After POSEIDON was overturned by the rogue wave about eighteen minutes into the film, I didn't draw a breath till the final frames rolled through.  Was the plot predictable?  Sure.  Could I figure out who was going to live and who was going to die?  I was right more times than I was wrong.<br /><br />POSEIDON was shot on 53 sound stages, some of them several stories tall.  The special effects were amazing and the digital work is unsurpassed.  The ship felt real even though it wasn't.<br /><br />In this HD-DVD version, the video portions are beautiful and really show off the cinematography and sets.  But the audio is where POSEIDON soars.  Captured in Dolby TrueHD, one of the best lossless codec on the market today.  A surround sound system totally enhances the viewing experience, and this is one of the movies you can show off your system on.<br /><br />The viewing can be gut-wrenching and the intensity is definitely pumped up, so young viewers probably aren't a good idea.  But for someone who's looking for a high-end action movie that doesn't slow down during a 90-minute presentation, POSEIDON is great entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>'Poseidon' suffers and then soars because of the same fact...it's not 'Titanic'.  Many critics critisized this film saying that it was 'Titanic' without any heart, without a love story and so it wasn't near as good.  But then again, if 'Poseidon' focused on a love story only to have the ship sink and everyone die the critics would say it was just a copy=cat of sorts.  It's pointless to try and be 'Titanic' because it's impossible to improve on that film unless you copy it frame for frame.  So 'Poseidon' decides to throw you almost instantly into action (I mean like within a few minutes) and doesn't let off until the credits roll.  Yes, some of this film is improbable, some of it is a bit cheesy, but for the most part it's a great popcorn flick with excelent graphics and some decent acting (most notably is Jacinda Barrett who plays a single mother)  The story line is pretty simple.  The cruise ship Poseidon is hit by a rogue wave and capsizes.  The captian of the ship orders everyone stay in the ballroom because it's airtight and they can wait for help, but two men think otherwise.  Josh Lucas plays a gambler who was once in the Navy and believes he can get out through the bottom of the ship, and Kurt Russell plays and ex-mayor who is trying to find his daughter (Emmy Rossum) who is in the disco with her boyfriend.  These two men end up taking some others with them including Barrett and her son and Richard Dreyfuss, a man whos lover just left him and is on the verge of suicide...(It's kinda funny to me how he spots the wave coming while he's trying to jump overboard...and I'm thinking 'nows your chance...you're sure to die now' but he turns around and runs...it's kinda funny)  ANyways, theres plenty of action throughout the film and plenty of suspence as well.  There are a few scenes that will make you tense, especially the ventilation shaft scene that everyone is talking about.  All in all the film is very well done and is sure to please fans of the genra...it's no 'Titanic' but we already have one of those!</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>This energetic, fast paced remake does not waste any time with tedious character development.

I liked this one a lot better than the ridiculous M:I:III.  No one going into this movie should be surprised at the premise or plot, that's not the point.  The idea is seeing a high tech remake of something with which we are already familiar.  And on that basis, this movie delivers.  This is not an art film.

It is raw and earthy and stunning to watch.  It never grows tired, it remains deep and challenging in parts and it rises above the restraints of the genre with a slew of deeply settled performances that are rooted in actual character progression.<br /><br />This 2006 remake has some nice CGI.<br /><br />Sadly, that is all that exists here.  There was no need for this other than to show off some great special effects, and it does that to a degree (I found the waves in A Perfect Storm much grander, to be honest).  The problem here is that there is no depth of story, and the script is so preposterous that it leaves you completely baffled at the fact that this was green lit at all.  The performances are mere surface, with no heart or soul (and you need that if you are going to root for anyone here).  Richard Dreyfuss is especially repulsive here; just hard to watch (and I love him more than most, as a rule).  Like another reviewer mentioned, this film is just bland.

I haven't laughed so hard in months.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>I know Robert Altman specializes in movies that ramble.  I know his works are loose ensemble pieces where plot is secondary to character and immediacy and spontaneity.  Still, although I desperately wanted to love this adaptation of the wonderfully warm Garrison Keillor radio program, it ultimately didn't work.  --But I'd still recommend you see it.  I just wouldn't make it a top priority.<br /><br />This is basically a photographed version of the radio show, with one added element: this is the final broadcast before the station is sold to an evil "hatchet man" who plans on tearing down the place and erecting a parking lot.  (This is how you know it's a movie: in real life when they tear down old buildings, they never erect parking lots; that would be too smart and practical.  Instead it's usually a strip mall or a 50-screen cinaplex, sans parking.)  So the old gang gathers for one last night of music and mayhem, as Garrison's old acts do the routines they've been doing for 30 years.<br /><br />In the movie, most of the acts are played by actors rather than the actual people who do the radio show.  And here's the remarkable thing about the movie: these actors do the acts as though they *have* been doing them for 30 years.  Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin play singing sisters with such perfect timing and a feel for one another that you have to hear and see them to believe it.  I for one am not a big fan of country music, but after seeing this movie, I'd buy a country album if Meryl recorded it.  Also, John C. Reilly and Woody Harrelson are a blast as a pair of raunchy cowboys, Dusty and Lefty.  You'd expect Harrelson to shine the most here, but honestly it's the ever-reliable Reilly who steals the show, without appearing to even try.  Both seem to be pretty fair guitar players too.  Their song "Bad Jokes" will make you laugh out loud.<br /><br />But the real surprise among the performers is Lindsay Lohan.  Her role is not huge, but she's got a certain chemistry with Meryl Streep, who plays her mother, and there is something about her singing "Frankie and Johnny" (with her own twisted ad-libbed lyrics) that is hilarious.  I can't explain exactly why, or why it wouldn't be funny if it were someone else.  You'll just have to see it.  Kudos for Altman for recognizing something delightfully quirky in Lohan and bringing it out.<br /><br />The plots that revolve *around* the show don't work so well.  One of my favorite actors, Kevin Kline, plays a sort of noirish detective who tells the story.  I understand his character is talked about in the real radio show and is here given flesh and blood to move the story along, but I'm not sure how well this works.  Ditto for Virginia Madsen, who plays a sort of "angel of death" who hovers over the cast and calls some of them home during the show.  (Of course, that's how I want to die, staring at Virginia Madsen's pouty lips.)  I'm not sure what to make of this part or this plotline.  I like Madsen, but she does little here besides walk around wearing a white trench coat.  Tommy Lee Jones is fine as the "axe man," but he's also just being standard issue Tommy Lee Jones with gruff voice and no-nonsense mannerisms--does he even have to *act* to play a role like this.  I kept expecting a revelation from him, some kind of higher purpose for him showing up in the last 20 minutes, but it didn't come.<br /><br />And the ending.  It's just bizarre.  The problem with ensemble-type stories like this is they are tough to end.  They aren't linear and rely more on atmosphere than plot; modualar in construction, they can go on forever.  The last scene here felt totally arbitrary and didn't leave me feeling fulfilled.  And I don't get the point of the transformation of  Lohan's character--except possibly to say that old fashioned values are being replaced by cold, calculating yuppiedom, which is kind of shallow.  The final appearance of Madsen's character also felt wrong.<br /><br />The music is sweet, however, and the performances within the show are flawless.  I haven't mentioned Keillor himself because he basically playes himself.  His most interesting bit is his scene where he refuses to acknowledge this is the last show.  His attitude is interesting, but we don't go any further with this character information.  Similar it's revealed that he and Streep used to be married, and are still obviously very close, yet again this is background that is presented but not really used after that.  Something about the story--performances aside--felt half-baked, like this were a draft more than a finished script.<br /><br />The transfer to DVD is excellent, the sound is superb, and the accompanying "making of" documentary is fun to watch.  The trailer makes the film appear to have more coherency than it does.  This won't go down as top-drawyer Altman, or even close.  He relies too much on how good Keillor and company are.  They are good, but we know that from years of listening to his radio show.  The movie, as gentle and sweet as it is, almost seems unnecessary--it adds nothing to A Prairie Home Companion.  The three stars are mostly for the artistry of the performances, not for Robert Altman's contributions.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>Intimate and loving theatrical version of the folksy and slightly radical Garrison Keillor radio program, A Prairie Home Companion, a weekly National Public Radio show, broadcast from the fictitious, rural prarie town of Lake Wobegon, Minnesota, "where all the women are pretty, all the men strong, and all the children above average.". If you've never tuned in, picture a folk music version of a Grand Ole Opry broadcast with sharp mid-western humor and accomplished and modest folk music, without money and celebrities.<br /><br />It would seem you may need to be a fan of the program to appreciate director Robert Altman's probing and low-key treatment of Keillor's script, in which the story of the radio show's last broadcast is merely a backdrop to the gentle rhythms and interactions of it's participants. Kevin Kline brings Keillor's Bogart-like film noir detective, Guy Noir, to  an enormous life-like comedic characterization, and Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly, as a pair of guitar strumming ranch hands, with a hysterically funny musical repertoire, are such a warm embrace of dusty saddle busters, it's like a cloud of mid-western dirt trails blows in with them every time they enter a scene.<br /><br />It doesn't all work so gracefully, it's meandering and inconsequential narrative at times seems less significant, and less smugly aloof, than any episode of the radio series, giving it the cinematic right to take itself more seriously. Guy Noir's 'lady in the white trenchcoat' becomes a literal angel who arrives to guide someone to heaven. Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin, as what is left of a once regionally renowned singing family, although a welcome sight, get somewhat lost in Altman's typical ad-lib and overlapping dialogue, the enormity of their celebrity status projection overwhelms the smallness of their roles.<br /><br />But anyone from Lake Wobegon would tell me to mind my manners and quit knit-picking. It's a real treat for fans of the radio show. And anyone else can surely appreciate a good dirty joke, delivered joyfully with a devil's grin by Harrelson and Reilly.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>Robert Altman's final film is kind of a change of pace for him albeit a refreshing one.  Altman's repertoire consists of films that for the most part employ large cats and skewer revered institutions.  It is with no little irony that Altman has chosen for a last vehicle a film that pays tribute to a beloved institution, live radio.  This is a gentle film, Woody Harrelson and John C Reilly's tribute to bad ribald jokes aside.  The cast is uniformly excellent, not least Garrison Keillor, and the songs are generally good.  Altman wasn't the flashiest of directors, usually allowing his actors and collaborators to take center stage.  If you're going to have a film be your valedictory I can think of worse ways to go out.  To paraphrase another Robert, "Thanks for the memories, "Mr. Altman."</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Nostalgia is both a lifestyle and the future. It is a lifestyle because<br /><br />it keeps us going through any kind of adverse events, because we can<br /><br />only cope with the present if we have the past on our side and with us,<br /><br />because all our happiness is always somewhere in the past, this feeling<br /><br />of complete satisfaction that we had when we were so young and so<br /><br />little knowledgeable that we didn't know we were hungry, we didn't know<br /><br />the ice on the window panes proved it was cold in the room. We were<br /><br />fully satisfied with what we had and we had life, and we were living,<br /><br />and we were not afraid of death. We must remember there has not been<br /><br />one war on the American territory for more than a century. No one can<br /><br />have the memory of such a war. Home, sweet home, the little house on<br /><br />the prairie, the nostalgia of immensity controlled and absolutely not<br /><br />menacing at all. Nostalgia is the fuel of our present and of our desire<br /><br />to live. We want to live because there is something in our past that<br /><br />keeps us living. And yet we will go and we may be afraid of the future<br /><br />because we do not know that the future will stop when we have fulfilled<br /><br />our mission on earth and our mission on earth is to complete a life and<br /><br />a life on earth is to do a few things completely and leave behind us<br /><br />the recollection and remembrance of a person who has not left without<br /><br />finishing his job, without finishing his bowl of soup, without coming<br /><br />to the end of his assignment. But who assigns anything to us ? God you<br /><br />would say ? Why not ? Nostalgia, our past for sure, because we are<br /><br />transported in this life by forces that are far more important and<br /><br />powerful than what we may think of. And it is not an angel that may<br /><br />help the Axe-man, the executioner of bad missions, die in some kind of<br /><br />silly road accident that will not prevent the axe from falling on our<br /><br />neck and from pruning the dead limbs of the tree of life. The show must<br /><br />go on and thirty years is by far enough for us now to pass on, to move<br /><br />on, to go on living, or thinking, or dancing, or whatever, maybe<br /><br />singing, but with the recollection of what is no longer and the dream<br /><br />of what can maybe come to life nurtured in the hatchery of our memory.<br /><br />Robert Altman is thus improvising and variationizing on themes of his<br /><br />own career and his own coming death. It is sad in a way and comforting<br /><br />because he knew the road would not stop with his death. Better still,<br /><br />Robert Altman is philosophizing on the world. Yes, some bad men will<br /><br />come one day with a bulldozer and pull down what you have believed in<br /><br />all your life, and yet these dark and vast forces that make the world<br /><br />turn round will not mean death because they will make us think of the<br /><br />next stage and the next phase in our life that will have to follow the<br /><br />general movement and find its little spot where it will be able to<br /><br />excel again, because excel we can at all ages, even in death. We could<br /><br />even think Robert Altlan who knows a lot about lame-duck presidents is<br /><br />already envisaging what will happen in 2008. Change, a big change, and<br /><br />some angel will come to accompany those going out and clean the place<br /><br />for those coming in. And yet some old streetcar will stand stranded<br /><br />along the main highway, turned into some kind of diner for nostalgic<br /><br />people watching the world running by on the highway, and they may even<br /><br />have the view of a beautiful redbrick church at the end of the street<br /><br />with its lights and its warmth we feel radiating from it and this<br /><br />knowledge that no matter how bad it may become now, tomorrow will<br /><br />always be and probably be just as good as it has always been for us if<br /><br />we just try to be human. Don't forget that the elephant who watches a<br /><br />man in the nude will always declare : ? Not bad, but can you breathe<br /><br />through it ? ? That's the spirit man. There is always something<br /><br />everywhere that is not perfect but it is a question of point of view.<br /><br />So the wise elephant will not try to force the man to breathe through<br /><br />what it thinks is a trunk, and why not drink through it too. But as for<br /><br />passing water, no problem...

As he proves time and again, the veteran filmmaker is a master at bringing out the natural qualities of his actors and the complicated tableau of life in his documentary-style scenes. In this case, he leisurely goes back and forth between the show and the backstage complications concocted by Keillor in his original screenplay. The slim plot outline has the radio show cast performing for the last time before a Texas-based corporation shuts them down for good, but Altman and Keillor imbue their movie with such a nostalgic burnish and elegiac grace that it's hard not to be pulled into the fate of the various characters.<br /><br />It also helps that the film was shot at the Fitzgerald Theatre in St. Paul, Minnesota, where the two-hour radio program is broadcast live every Saturday night. Quite a stellar ensemble has been bought together by Altman whose reputation obviously precedes him, though not all are used to the best of their abilities. Most prominent of the onstage performers are Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin as the singing Johnson sisters, the sentimental, rather ditsy Yolanda and the more embittered Rhonda. They are convincing as siblings, especially when they talk over each other without hesitation (a funny comedy bit they repeated at this year's Oscars). Even funnier are Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly as a pair of singing cowpokes, Lefty and Dusty, who perform ribald campfire songs with Hope-and-Crosby dexterity and even keep in character on the accompanying making-of feature.<br /><br />Kevin Kline seems to be resuscitating his pompous dim bulb from "A Fish Called Wanda" as the theater security chief Guy Noir, though I think he has been unfortunately allowed to belabor his slapstick routines here. Working merely as plot devices, Tommy Lee Jones comes late into the film as the Axeman, the corporate honcho closing the show, while Virginia Madsen plays a Dangerous Woman, a becalming angel of death who walks around the theater relatively unnoticed as she carries out her heaven-sent mission. Both do what they can within the limitations of their roles. SNL's Maya Rudolph plays the pregnant stage manager with efficiency. And except for her very last scene, a contrived plot turn, tabloid teen queen Lindsay Lohan acquits herself reasonably as Yolanda's suicide preoccupied daughter Lola. As the virtual glue that holds all the flimsy plot machinations together, Keillor gets to play his unsentimental true-life self with aplomb.<br /><br />As evocative as the film is, the unwieldy combination of country songs, long-winded stories, quaint commercials and corny jokes can feel pretty redundant over its running time, and one of Altman's chief faults is letting certain scenes run on for too long and with little purpose. However, I'm sure fans of the radio show will be charmed by the results, and the bittersweet ending is a nice Altman-style touch. The DVD has plenty of extras, the best of which is an informative making-of feature lasting about fifty minutes. Through interviews with Altman, Keillor and the principal cast, it helpfully goes into the genesis of not only the movie but the radio show for those of us unfamiliar with it. Not as enlightening is the commentary track by a rather forgetful, eighty-year old Altman assisted by a supportive Kline. There are also extended musical performances and advertisements of which we generally see snippets in the movie, as well as the theatrical trailer and a soundtrack preview.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>`A Prairie Home Companion' released in `06 takes a nostaligic look at the bygone days of live radio as it chronicles the ficticious last performance of a country music variety show. With the exception of the brief opening and closing scenes the entire film takes place within the confines of an old Midwest theater. You see the onstage broadcast in it's entirety along with numerous glimpses backstage observing the performers interacting.<br /><br />While the music is infectious I found the storyline to be contrived, quite obscure and disjointed. As the evening progresses the performers one by one learn that they are doing their last show. The hatchet man who is closing down the theater is expected to make an appearance sometime during the evening and along with that dire expectation strange things begin to happen. One performer dies, a young girl writes poetry about death and suicide  while an unidentified blonde woman in a white trench coat wanders unobstructed backstage and onstage making foreboding comments like, "Do you believe in the fullness of time?"  Bottom line, it just didn't hold my interest, by the end I really didn't care what the ending was to portend.<br /><br />This film boasts some well known personalities in the cast such as Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, Woody Harrelson and Lindsay Lohan, but lesser known Garrison Keiller steals the show. Unfortunately `A Praire Home Companion' makes for a much better concert than film.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>This movie is a reverie on death. Director Robert Altman unwittingly (perhaps) composed his own elegy with this film.<br /><br />It is a pensive mix of real and fictional characters who share life's stage, who weave in and out of each other's dialogue. Although there is more of the realistic than the supernatural here. You get what would be a typical Prairie Home Companion broadcast. Garrison Keillor's genius shines through - minus his signature Lake Woebegone report. But the goofy, all-too-apt ads for rhubarb and Minnesota pizza are there. Mostly, the music is there. Traditional folk/country songs are mixed with Keillor's original compositions. The actors do their own singing and all of them perform with heartfelt brilliance. They all could have second careers as song stylists. L.Q. Jones, the perennial Sam Peckinpah villain, delivers an especially moving turn. Meryl Streep has an angelic singing voice, pitch-perfect.<br /><br />It's the music that blends the real and unreal so beautifully. The result is like sitting down with a mix of bourbon and water at a favorite neighborhood bar. The lovely amber quaff will warm you into a gentle acceptance of the all of it - the raunchy humor, the camaraderie, and eventual death.<br /><br />Kevin Kline and Robert Altman do the DVD commentary. Their banter almost takes the form of one of Altman's improvised, overlaid film conversations. Kline makes some literary, amusing remarks, asks some pertinent questions. Altman responds a little lamely. But some interesting information about Altman's technique emerges - such as the observation that, in this case at least, Altman strove to make the camera a character "en passant" in the action.<br /><br />Kline and Altman sort of peter out toward the end of their commentary. But I still think the commentary is probably worth listening to. If for no other reason, it will give you a chance to view this wonderful, mellowing movie a second time.</p></br><a href="../users/A5A2QE6NECFR5.html">A5A2QE6NECFR5</a><br/><p>I have been a casual fan of the radio version of "Prairie Home Companion" for decades, although I seldom listen to more than 30 minutes of it at a time, usually only if I am driving somewhere on a Saturday afternoon when it is being broadcast. I read seven or eight reviews of the movie before getting around to seeing it, and while most critics kind of liked it, there were a few grumbles. However, I thought the film was excellent, and the fantasy sequences which bother some people were needed to cut down on the sweet and nostalgic elements that bring the radio show its steady fans. I liked all the casting, too. Robert Altman is not a favorite director, but when he is good, he is very good, as in "M*A*S*H* and "Nashville." When he is bad, he is terrible. But here, I thought he done good. Same with Garrison K. I trashed his recent novel in an Amazon review, but I liked him in this.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7.html">A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7</a><br/><p>The premise is completely false of course -- A Prairie Home Companion is in no danger of disappearing from the airwaves in any of our lifetimes.  But that's fine too -- it is a pleasure to watch the likes of Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin, and Truman Capote, oops, Phillip Seymour Hoffman meander their way through some pretty good country songs (though far short of the best from Altman's Nashville) and some truly awful jokes while death, in the form of a beautiful angel, stalks the stage.  Kevin Kline as a gumshoe and Tommy Lee Jones as a Christian radio owner zealot also have a wonderful time with their roles.  I got the impression that GK was hugely pleased to have so much talent on his show, if only in movie form.  But all this talent is immersed in, frankly, fluff, entertaining fluff, but fluff nonetheless.  Robert Altman's master talents were taxed not at all, kind of like watching Tiger Woods play putt-putt golf.</p></br><a href="../users/A8X8D4BUY5DFU.html">A8X8D4BUY5DFU</a><br/><p>Witty, fun, and gave me a good feel for the backstage of the production.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>**1/2<br /><br />I'm not sure how anyone could have been expected to make a workable film out of "A Prairie Home Companion," so I guess  writer Garrison Keillor and director Robert Altman shouldn't be judged too harshly for not succeeding in their effort.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the source, "A Prairie Home Companion" is a weekly radio variety show that has been broadcast live from a theater in St. Paul, Minnesota, off and on for well over thirty years.  Created and hosted by Keillor, the show, as its title suggests, offers a folksy blend of country music, humorous anecdotes, live commercial spots and generous helpings of homespun wisdom.<br /><br />For the movie, Altman and Keillor chose not to go with the actual PHC cast (with the notable exception of Keillor himself), but to hire big name movie stars - Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin, Lindsay Lohan et. al. - to do the on-stage performing as well as enact the fictionalized drama taking place backstage.  It is in the drama that the movie runs into its greatest trouble.  Needing some sort of narrative hook on which to hang the otherwise disconnected musical sequences, the filmmakers have come up with the stale device of a big bad business tycoon from Texas (Tommy Lee Jones) buying the station and threatening to shut down the program which he sees merely as a quaint little relic from a bygone era.  In a bizarre foray into the supernatural, the movie also has the angel of death in a white trench coat (Virginia Madsen) gliding around the theater uttering enigmatic comments on the meaning of life as she zeroes in on her latest scheduled "victim."<br /><br />Since Altman was seriously ill at the time of filming (this turned out to be his final movie), we can understand why so much of the film deals with the issues of death and the melancholic passage of time.  But what we can't understand is how he managed to turn "A Prairie Home Companion" into such a lifeless and uninvolving movie.  One wonders how the show itself would have been able to stay on the air for as long as it has if it were really as desultory, enervating and dour as it appears to be here.  Even the live audience can't seem to muster up much enthusiasm for what's taking place on stage.  The least Altman could have done is include some shots of the audience to create at least some sense of interaction between the fans and the performers and gin up some excitement.  Instead, the people remain shrouded in darkness, with only some occasional applause or muted laughter to remind us that they're even there.  The movie is far too lackluster and passive in its approach to the subject, lacking the energy, passion and dynamism one would reasonably expect from a movie centered, as this one is, on live musical performing (watch "A Hard Day`s Night" and "A Mighty Wind" to see how it can and should be done).<br /><br />The musicianship and singing are unobjectionable and decent, if not exactly foot-stomping or rousing, yet even they fail to rouse us out of the lethargy we've been lulled into by the dull behind-the-scenes drama that somehow passes for a "storyline" in the film.  There are some occasionally funny moments along the way - Kevin Kline scores as an anachronistic security guard straight out of a bad film noir mystery, and Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly have some fun as two singing cowpokes whose risqu&eacute; lyrics offend the producer far more than they do the audience - but there's a definite air of desperation about the project, as if the people who came up with the idea just couldn't find any way to really make it work as a film.  There are lots of nice little "bits" floating around inside "A Prairie Home Companion," but the filmmakers never manage to bring them all together into a movie that really matters much.<br /><br />The tone of sadness that permeates the film makes it more effective as a valedictory for the late director than as a fitting tribute to the goal and spirit of the original "Prairie Home Companion."</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>The movie was much like the show "Prairie Home Companion:" it was funny in spots, corny in spots and just plain bad in spots. Altman does a great job with the material. The direction was timely and well-paced. The acting was good. Streep had the northern plains accent down. Woody Harrelson was funny. Lily Tomlin who played Streeps's sister did not have the accent down. However, she did well. Garrison played himself rather well. The major problem I had was the plot. The movie had Guy Noir as the head of security. Kevin Klein played him well, but the character was too stupid. Even in the skits on the show, Noir's cases were silly, but he wasn't a total idiot. There was an angel of death, which worked in spots but on the whole was confusing. One of the better scenes involved the angel. When the angel was still mortal, she died when she lost control while she was driving because she laughing at a joke while listening to "A Prairie Home Companion."  She didn't even understand why the joke was funny. She and Garrison talked about why the joke was funny. The scene was pure "Prairie Home." The best of the movie for me was the beginning. Altman does his thing of rapidly switching between different characters and plot lines. The humor of the conversations were hilarious. The effort the producer exerts to get Garrison on stage in time was hilarious. The bad joke song was very good too.<br /><br />I recommend the movie. Keep your expectations low and just let the humor come to you. The movie really works most of the time. Just don't expect the plot to make sense.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"A Prairie Home Companion" takes its title from the syndicated radio variety show created and hosted by Garrison Keillor that can probably be found once a week on your local public radio station. The show is taped before a live audience in the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, Minnesota. This movie is a look backstage during a fictional final show. The real show is alive and well, although it did take a hiatus in 1987 that lasted several years. I've never been a fan of director Robert Altman, because, as he is the first to say, he's not interested in stories. He is interested in behavior. I, on the other hand, find behavior meaningless without the context of an interesting story to make it bearable. But Robert Altman was a good choice to direct Garrison Keillor's script for "A Prairie Home Companion", which also favors behavior over story. But Keillor doesn't like neuroses, which counterbalances Altman's tendency toward the neurotic. The film is sustained by its cast and its tone -a reserved, frank, good-natured sensibility that it borrows from its real-life namesake.<br /><br />Guy Noir (Kevin Kline), a former private eye straight out of a 1940s crime film, does security for "A Prairie Home Companion", and he introduces us to the show's final performance at the Fitzgerald Theater. New corporate ownership is closing the show down for being an anachronism, and the "axeman" (Tommy Lee Jones) is expected for tonight's show. A lovely lady (Virginia Madsen) in a white trench coat has caught Guy Noir's eye as she mills around backstage, and he wonders what her presence may mean. Meanwhile, the show goes on. Garrison Keillor hosts without any intention of changing anything for the final show. The Johnson Girls, Yolanda (Meryl Streep) and Rhonda (Lily Tomlin), a lifelong singing act, chat about their family backstage and belt it out onstage, as Yolanda's morbid daughter Lola (Lindsay Lohan) watches from the wings. Dusty & Lefty (Woody Harrelson & John C. Reilly), a singing comedic cowboy act, aren't inclined to censor themselves. And stage manager Molly (Maya Rudolph) tries to keep things running smoothly with uneven success.<br /><br />Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin are so natural that it's easy to watch them. Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly are a hoot. But credit for holding the whole thing together goes to Kevin Kline. Guy Noir is the improbable character to whom we always return for some sort of odd perspective. I don't know how an actor can embody a caricature so unaffectedly that he is accepted at face value, yet we are still able to laugh at him. Kevin Kline manages. I shouldn't be surprised. Kline is almost without parallel as a comic actor. "A Prairie Home Companion" is grounded by the presence of Keillor himself and by the very genuine Maya Rudolph as the show's pregnant stage manager. They are joined by a few people from the real "Prairie Home Companion" show, including band leader Richard Dworsky. "A Prairie Home Companion" has a measured pace and, in spite of being the final show, it's open-ended. But both Robert Altman and Garrison Keillor fans will find a lot to like.<br /><br />The DVD (New Line 2006): Bonus features include extended performances from the film, a making-of featurette, a soundtrack preview, a theatrical trailer (2 min), an audio commentary, and a DVD-ROM (Windows only). "Onstage at the Fitzgerald: A Music Companion" offers extended performances of 10 musical numbers and 6 "sponsor" sequences from the film. "Come Play with Us: A Feature Companion" (49 min) has 6 parts that take us through the history of the show, writing the film, filming, the all-star cast, and the music. Includes interviews with Garrison Keillor, Robert Altman, and cast. The "Soundtrack Preview" provides a track listing and some clips from the CD-DVD package. The audio commentary with director Robert Altman and actor Kevin Kline is worthwhile for Altman fans. Kline leads the commentary, which often turns into an interview with Altman. Kline gets a lot of information out of Altman about his approach to directing actors, camera work, and his reasoning in some scenes. Thanks to Kline for conducting an extended interview with Altman, as well as contributing his own observations, this is an interesting commentary.

That's what projects from this movie.<br /><br />It's a term labelling social fabric existing and yet masking a sense of disconnectedness and disorganization.<br /><br />The collaboration between Robert Altman and Garrison Keillor was so promising.  Two totally original, brilliant and creative people coming together on a project about something so beloved, so entrenched in our culture.<br /><br />The result hits some marks, to be sure:  the steadiness of midwestern people, the deadpan humor.  And then we get death, too, in the form of a beautiful trenchcoated woman.  And who knew that Meryl Streep was such a fantastic singer!<br /><br />When we finished watching it, my wife said, "Well, it's better than when William Shatner writes for himself."  Her perception is dead accurate.  The inevitable self-absorption of this effort is not quite as bad as William Shatner writing scripts for Captain Kirk.<br /><br />But it gets damn close.  I doubt we'll watch it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>`A Prairie Home Companion' has an impressive guest list.  An all-star cast joins Garrison Keillor as they send off his celebrated thirty-year radio program.  Usually known for his keen folksy sensibilities, he is best at creating and telling funny and engaging stories from "Lake Woebegone," a fictitious town in Minnesota where "all the women are strong; the men are good looking; and the children are above average."  He throws out his best asset, but writes the story for the movie instead.  Guy Noir (Kevin Kline), a 40's era private eye, narrates his tale about his work, investigating as he moonlight's as a security guard for a `PHC'.  He seeks to find out the death of St. Paul's Fitzgerald Theater, while a `PHC' puts on its last show.  Fortunately, the delivery, while making the movie less interesting, is decent enough to avoid too much sentimentality or anger for the show's demise.  Unfortunately, some of the best acts are interrupted for the backstage development of the story.  Nevertheless, Woody Harrelson and John C. O'Reilly really deliver as the funny cowboys, Dusty and Lefty.  (Their rendition of a song called "Bad Jokes" showcases some of the best aspects of Keillor's final show.)  Similarly, the Johnson Sisters (Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin) also provide some key singing and comedy moments.  (Streep has a great Minnesota accent--as you might expect.)  Keillor, the man who brought great acts from unknown bluegrass bands to forgotten favorites (like the Everly Brothers) could have given himself a better sendoff, but at least he gave us a very professional cast.  If you liked `A Prairie Home Companion,' you will probably like the movie with a few reservations.  If you didn't like a `PHC,' don't bother.  At the end of the final show, young Lola Anderson (Lindsey Lohan) does a song, Keillor's fine gesture to extend the radio world to the next generation.  Perhaps the best part is at the beginning when a series of tuned-in radio broadcasts showcase the variety and influences Keillor drew from for his fine radio show.</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>The parts that are just the quasi regular show are good, with Garrison<br /><br />and the regular singing, humor, and pithy philosophy.  The subtexts, however, about an angel, Guy Noir, and the death of an old man were pointless and obtuse.  The Tommy Jones cameo was somewhat effective and clear cut, although a bit over-the-top. Meryl and Lily had good chemistry.  The cowboys were funny.  However, overall better just to listen to the show on the radio.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Those who have enjoyed the "Prairie Home Companion" over the years, will probably enjoy this movie.  It is a typical Garrison Keillor production with the addition of a thin plot and lots of celebrities.  The show has supposedly been bought out by a company in Texas which plans to tear down the building and replace it with a parking lot.  The cast, including Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as singing sisters, and Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly as a couple of randy, singing cowboys, performs a bittersweet and nostalgic last show.  The celebrity singers do very well with the singing and the acting, and the movie becomes very similar to a typical "Prairie Home Companion" broadcast.  The beginning of the show is somewhat disjointed, but once the performances start, the movie picks up speed and is full of gentle humor and toe-tapping songs.  An angel in a white trench coat drifts through the movie, looking for someone to "take to God" and Lindsay Lohan adds a dark note as Streep's poetry-spouting, suicide-obsessed daughter.  Some of it works and some of it doesn't, but the gentle humor and old-fashioned music remain.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Fans of radio show: ****<br /><br />Everyone else: **<br /><br />If you are a fan of the NPR radio show "A Prairie Home Companion", hosted by Garrison Keillor, you will no doubt delight in the new Robert Altman film based on the popular staple of public radio. No need to read further, simply go to the theater and buy your ticket.<br /><br />If you are not necessarily a fan of the show, read on. I doubt even the large, impressive cast will make the film an enjoyable exercise for you.<br /><br />Minutes before the beginning of the weekly broadcast of "A Prairie Home Companion", we meet Garrison Keillor and many other members of his reparatory group. Tonight is the last broadcast of the show; a large corporation in Texas has purchased the Fitzgerald Theater, in Minneapolis, home of the show, and plans to turn it into a parking lot. Guy Noir (Kevin Kline), head of security for the theater, arrives minutes before the broadcast and gets things started by bringing us to date and introducing a beautiful femme fatale (Virginia Madsen) wearing a white trench coat, who mysteriously roams through the theater. The Johnson Sisters, Rhonda (Lily Tomlin) and Yolanda (Meryl Streep) arrive with Yolanda's daughter, Lola (Lindsay Lohan), who likes to write poetry about death. Dusty (Woody Harrelson) and Lefty (John C. Reilly) are on hand to sing cowboy songs and tell dumb jokes. As the show progresses, the Axe man (Tommy Lee Jones) arrives from Texas and watches the remainder of the show, but the nostalgia seems lost on him.<br /><br />Written by Keillor and directed by Robert Altman, "A Prairie Home Companion" tries to offer both a backstage look at the radio show and a contrived story to give the story a beginning, middle and end. Sort of.<br /><br />"Companion" has many signature Altman touches. There are moments which seem highly ad-libbed; Streep and Tomlin tell a lengthy tale in which they relate the story of a relative, filling in each other's blanks, adding details the other forgot, and generally talking over each other. There are also a number of long tracking shots, following characters through various levels of the theater, and through multiple rooms. But beyond these few examples, the film is fairly straightforward and conventional. There aren't a lot of the signature Altman touches; there may be one or two other examples of his work, but he seems to have stuck to a fairly conventional structure.<br /><br />The problem is the film is too straight forward. Because everyone knows this is the last broadcast, there is very little drama in the story. Worse, everyone seems to accept it. Even though this is a pretty standard clich&eacute; ("The troop's last hurrah"), the narrative doesn't really follow through on this, no one is fighting against it, least of all Keillor, who seems to view the situation as an excuse for a break.<br /><br />During the film, we learn Keillor and Yolanda (Streep) once had a relationship. If she hadn't married her husband, Lola's father, she might have ended up with the radio host. Streep manages to make her character's mixed emotions evident, but it almost seems to be an afterthought, for the actress and the filmmakers. She flits about, makes a couple of comments, but doesn't seem all that consumed by it. One thing "Companion" makes clear is that Keillor is no actor. As Streep goes through the machinations of creating this character, Keillor mainly stands around, looking bemused. One gets the sense he would start laughing if this same situation were happening in real life. This happens more than once; as Keillor's character is expected to demonstrate some emotion, he seems unwilling or unable to. If they aren't going to give any serious thought to a behind-the-scenes story, why try to create one at all?<br /><br />One of the interesting things about the film is the attempt to try to bring some of the radio characters to life. Guy Noir and Dusty, two characters voiced by Keillor in the radio show, are played by Kevin Kline and Woody Harrelson. It is an interesting idea, but Keillor changes the characters. In "Companion", Noir is now the head of security for the theater. Gone are his incredibly convoluted adventures as a private eye and the pointed political satires. Some of his overwrought dialogue remains, but his radio persona seems to be intact only during interactions with Virginia Madsen's character. But she isn't completely interlocked with Noir's character, or he with her and each interacts with others.<br /><br />Dusty and Lefty (John C. Reilly) have become performers in the show who show up to work every day in full cowboy attire. Why they do this isn't explained.<br /><br />Streep and Tomlin are good as the Johnson Sisters, showing believable evidence of their years as a sister act, traveling the road together. Lohan is okay as Streep's daughter, but it isn't a remarkable performance. In fact, all three are just good. Not great.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones' character, the Axe man, is a strange role for him. He shows up halfway through the radio show, has a brief interaction with Guy Noir, and then spends the rest of his time watching the show from a VIP booth. He doesn't interact with anyone, just observes. Why did Jones take this role? It offers absolutely nothing to the film and doesn't seem to offer him any challenges.<br /><br />Other staples of the radio show; "The Ketchup Advisory Board", "Powder Milk Biscuits", etc., are used as bridges from the action on stage, during the radio show, to the `drama' backstage. Unfortunately, most of the drama backstage seems to be of little consequence to anyone.<br /><br />"A Prairie Home Companion" doesn't really work. It wants to provide a filmed recording of the venerable radio show and provide a behind the scenes glimpse of the inner workings. But because the film cuts away from the action on stage, to the contrived fictional story, we don't see enough of the popular staples of the actual show. And because the backstage bits contain fabricated drama, these don't provide an actual representation of what goes into the making of this show week after week. It is unfortunate Keillor and Altman decided to monkey around with everything so much. It would have been better to simply make a concert film. What they did make is a disappointment.</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>"Prairie Home Companion" is director Robert Altman's homage to the long running radio series. The (fictional) action unfolds during the last performance of the show, which is being shut down as the radio station has been bought by some Texans who have other plans.<br /><br />"Prairie Home Companion" features many of the real stars of the radio show as themselves including the show's driving force Garrison Keillor. Sadly Keillor is no screen actor and the scenes with him bring the film to a grinding halt.<br /><br />Much of the dialogue in the underdeveloped plot appears to be improvised and leads nowhere. Many of the characters are also underdeveloped - especially Kevin Kline as "Guy Noir" the bumbling security man and Virginia Madsen as the "Dangerous Woman".<br /><br />The only thing that perks this film up are the musical numbers - especially the ones with John C. O'Reilly and Woody Harrelson as the singing cowboys Dusty and Lefty.<br /><br />"Prairie Home Companion" is somewhat of a disappointment to fans of the radio show and may actually appeal more to those who are not familiar with it.<br /><br />Although mildly amusing, one can't help but ask the question - what exactly was the point of all this?</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>WTF???  Look, I listen to A Prairie Home Companion from time to time and I absolutely love Garrison's Lake Woebegone stories.  But I don't know what the heck this is.  Sure, I recognized all the characters.  Guy Noir and Lefty and Dusty and blah, blah.  But where is the plot?  Okay, there's a thin one about the show being cancelled and all, but couldn't Garrison made this a little more compelling?  People talking to angels like it's the most natural thing on earth.  People dying and no one acting like they really cared. Oh, yeah they will go sing veiled songs, but really, I was bored to death.  This movie was a huge disappointment for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>Sometimes Robert Altman's ensemble dramas are spectacular (Gosford Park), sometimes they are the best medicine for the sleep-deprived (Dr. T and the Women). Unfortunately, this movie is the latter. Despite the wonderful cast, this movie drags on and on. About an hour into it, I zonked out. Maybe, I'll go back to it and finish watching it, but if I do, it's only due to the respect I have for the actors. I'll admit that I might be lacking the necessary background to see the movie (having never heard the radio show); still, what kind of movie limits it's audience to only the baby boomers and excludes everyone else?</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>Boring, boring, boring, wish it was more.

The send-up of the real live `Prairie Home Companion' show was certainly almost flawless in its charm and evocation of author Garrison Keillor's way with his audience, both live and electronic. And, performances by such luminaries as Woody Harrelson, Kevin Kline, John C. Reilly, Meryl Streep, and Lily Tomlin, and Keillor himself seemed flawless.<br /><br />The problem lays, I think, in the plot bracketing the `last performance' of the fictional take on the real live radio show of the same name. This two pronged plot, driven primarily by performances by Virginia Madsen and Tommy Lee Jones, which is based on the premise that the new owners of the theatre and radio station are closing everything down and turning the property into a parking lot. It just seems as if nothing comes of these two roles. They simply drive off together into the night after the `last performance', and nothing changes. The next day, the scenery is struck and the demolition contractors arrive to plant charges to implode the theatre.<br /><br />Fortunately, that plot is done simply as an excuse to broadcast a `Prairie Home Companion' show. The primary screenwriting credits go to Garrison Keillor. One would wish he had shared the effort with someone with a real talent for humorous plots. Woody Allen and Buck Henry immediately come to mind.<br /><br />And yet, there is a great wealth of `moments', most of which come from the interplay between Tomlin and Streep as a sister singing duo, with daughter Lindsey Lohan, who may have done this role to resuscitate her tarnished image as a `bad girl'. Another great pair is the singing duo of Harrelson and Reilly, who manage to do a risqu&eacute; song which may single-handedly be responsible for the shift from PG to PG-13.<br /><br />I have always been a big fan of Kevin Kline, and this role seems to rely on some echos from his Academy Award performance in `A Fish Named Wanda', where the primary attribute of the character is gross ineptitude.<br /><br />If you simply ignore the Madsen / Jones subplot, you are in for a great good time, even if the movie is not Altman's best outing, it is certainly worthy of his classic large cast style.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>I thought this movie would be fantastic with its all star cast of superb movie stars like Kevin Kline, Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin etc.<br /><br />Instead the movie was extremely slow, boring, and drawn out!! It was so bad that 45 minutes into the movie, I couldn't stand watching another second of it. So, I stopped the movie and promptly returned it to the video store I rented it from.<br /><br />If the movie moved at a swifter pace and was a bit more witty, then perhaps it would have been good.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C9GCHR99WX3F.html">A1C9GCHR99WX3F</a><br/><p>A Prairie Home Companion was a radio program that wasted hosted in the 1970's and 1980's that was broadcasted each Saturday night from the Fitzgerald Theatre in St. Paul, Minnesota, the movie pretty much takes place in the theatre that night, with the beginning being filmed at Mickey's Diner, that fans of the Mighty Ducks movies might regonize that little diner, even from D3: The Mighty Ducks. My two biggest problems with the movie is that the oepnning credits are kind of well, how should I put it, boring? My other problem is, that I felt watching this movie, that they spent too much time showing what was going on backstage at the final broadcast, the actors kept talking over the songs. Okay so it might look 3 problems, I have with this movie. But if you are a big fan of the radio program, you will most denfily, or its music, you will certinaly this movie. If I wanted to see what goes on backstage at a progam like this, I would try to look for another movie that this happens, we could have seen more of the show, after all isn't backstage supposed to be private? The program's creator Garrison Keillor appears as himself, and he also hosts the program. The regular performers of this show, come back for the last show, and that the new owner, wants to take down the theatre, and put in a parking lot. And it ios almost show time, now radio shows for a certain station, are put on at the station itself, and every so often a live broadcast could happen form somewhere else. And not Prairie Home Companion, it was broadcasted from a theatre in front of a paying crowd, and people can also tune in on the radio. But GK being stubbron, doesn't want to say a few farewell wods to listeners, and refuses to do so. The regulars inlude sisters Yolanda and Rhonda Johnson (Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin), and they sing about memories of thier old home. Yolanda's daughter, Lola (Lindsey Lohan) is backstage writing poems about suicide. And there are singing cowboys Dusty and Lefty (Woody Harrelson, John C. Reilly). And you also get a balladeer Chuck Akers (L.Q. Jones). And don't get me started about Guy Noir (Kevin Kline) who works for security that falls for lovely lady (Virginia Madsen). The movie got handed a PG-13, which is for the humor that goes on in the movie, so this movie won't really be appiorate for your kid, and you wou will kow your kids pretty then I do, but maybe at least wait until they are at the right age for this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>I have to admit I've never really "got" Garrison Keillor; maybe you have to be a Minnesotan or even an American to get it.  Is he supposed to be funny, or whimsical or perhaps even satirical? Written by Keillor himself and directed by the legendary Robert Altman, A Prairie Home Companion centers on the premise that everyone is about to say goodbye with the final broadcast of the actual old-time radio variety show taking place the Fitzgerald theater in St. Paul, Minnesota.<br /><br />Various artists have come along for the ride: Yolanda Johnson (Meryl Streep) and Rhonda Johnson (Lily Tomlin) are the last remaining members of a musical family whom Yolanda describes to her daughter Lola (Lindsay Lohan) as "the Carter family, only not famous."<br /><br />Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly also make an appearance as a duo of singing cowboys, and a hard-boiled private detective Guy Noir (Kevin Kline) is the story's bumbling and ungainly narrator. While Guy is waiting for the new boss (Tommy Lee Jones) to make an appearance, Guy doesn't know what to make of the apparition in a white trench coat who shows up unannounced, especially when she looks like Virginia Madsen.<br /><br />A Prairie Home Companion is beautifully shot and remarkably cozy and atmospheric, and it has many lovely and funny moments, but there's not a lot going on. Dramatically, it's melodious to the point of torpor. Obviously the film has a folksy and low-key appeal and will probably only really appeal to fans of the radio show.<br /><br />But the film only really comes alive when the various artists sing - including a fabulous Meryl Streep. Of course, Altman uses his usual trademark of the wandering camera, strolling from character to character, pausing to watch and listen as they tease one another, natter on about trivia, reminisce about the old days, worry about the future and partake of flatulence.<br /><br />Everything in this movie just comes across as so old fashioned, from the songs to the stories and  - apart from Meryl - it's all a bit boring. Only the ribald jokes of Dusty and Lefty have a trace of novelty and bawdiness invested in them. Corny and quaint are two words that apply to this movie, but another two words tedious and lackluster could equally be applied.

Not only was Garrison going to be IN the film, but he'd also written the screenplay. What more could us fans want?<br /><br />Perhaps my expectations were too high ...<br /><br />Now I LOVE listening to the radio. I enjoy stories being told to me -- Lake Woebegon is one of my favorite montages -- and I like the way Mr. Keillor's tales tickle my funny bone. The fake sponsors (Duct Tape, Ketchup Advisory Board, Powder Milk Biscuits, etc.), imaginary characters ("Guy Noir, Private Eye") and general tomfoolery add a quaint quality to the listening experience that harkens back to radio-days gone by. But does this translate well to film?<br /><br />It might have had the story been a close-up view of the actors, characters, or stories. Combining all three into a 105 minute film could be challenging for any director, and Robert Altman (GOSFORD PARK) gives it his best but unfortunately fails to deliver.<br /><br />Not only was the movie slow to get going, it also held zero character development. We're plopped into the middle of a cast of characters with very little knowledge as to how they got where they are or why (one of the cast, whom we know for maybe 120 seconds, dies but his demise held no impact because we don't know enough about him to care). The fact that we view the radio show by watching its progression was only moderately entertaining and the only memorable moments were when "bad jokes" are being told by a couple of bristling cowpokes (Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly). Many of the characters come and go in mere minutes and we (the viewer) are never given the opportunity to get close to them. The exception to this was Kevin Kline who plays fictional-character-turned-real-life-detective, Guy Noir. His constant hand/finger injuries are quite funny and it is through his eyes that we see most of the action.<br /><br />I would tell you what the story is about, but I don't want to bore you. It just isn't that interesting. And I HATE saying that! I'll continue listening to A Prairie Home Companion on my local National Public Radio affiliate, but I won't be watching this film again. Sorry Mr. Keillor.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3SXHT6RBV81.html">A2F3SXHT6RBV81</a><br/><p>Marylou Burke was in this film along with Garrison Keillor and Kevin Kline, portraying the last radio broadcast of Prairie Home Companion.  Backstage at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, the movie starts as we see Mr. Keillor with his pants off.  As the program starts on WLT, G. K. has on the longest red tie I ever saw.  Nobody's perfect.<br /><br />The real mystery is taking place as the show is on the air.  What happened to Chuck while his record was playing?  The death of an old man is no tragedy.  He'd left Evelyn behind who wailed, "I don't want him to go."  She was advised to forgive his shortcomings.  It doesn't seem right without Chuck -- what you got going on here?  There's always that damn doubt and disappointment doesn't get you anywhere.  Like a man tends to do, the cast are told that life is a struggle anyway, to just ignore bad news and it will go away. Is that rational thought? It's time to integrate all sides of your psyche and bring your intuition, emotions and physical body into play too.<br /><br />The Johnson sisters are has-beens left from a singing religious family and bad, bad.  Things tend to fall apart.  It was a revelation for both of us.  He had no idea what happened.  We had a situation here with no resolution.<br /><br />Radio gives shy persons the strength to get up and do what needs to be done.  A good voice is a necessity for a broadcaster.  Lois, the blonde angel of death dressed in a white trench coat, had come for Chuck but also enticed Carl Gardner, played by Tommy Lee Jones, to take her to the airport on a short cut.  She'd told G. K. "because of your story, I died."  There can be no silence on radio, and the dead air is filled with stupid "ad" spots as Cindy explained which don't have to be accurate as they just serve a purpose -- thus, the mystery of radio where anything goes.  We don't look back, but the luxury was the music.<br /><br />A man was the cause of it all.  The damn carpet reminded G. K. of an island full of palm trees and azure skies.  A place called Paradise, short term.  He does have a way with words.  Duct tape won't make an honest man out of you.  It was great fun and Garrison Keillor was fantastic playing himself matter-of-factly, not bigger than life, as he appears on the radio every week one place or another.  He came to Knoxville and wrongly called it a Presbyterian town -- not so, it is a drinking town.<br /><br />Lois had told G. K. that the characters on his Wobegan show seemed like "my friends" and I was the one who has loved you so true.  He just went away.  After the bad (risque) jokes by the cowboys, things went down the drain.  Just something happened, right?  It didn't change a thing and she decided not to press charges.  For now.  Actually, it was the end of everything when the Angel returned and kept them guessing who's next.</p></br><a href="../users/A192KEPM0HW6AC.html">A192KEPM0HW6AC</a><br/><p>Movie buffs still hotly debate whether Don Siegel's 1957 cult classic Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a cautionary allegory against McCarthyism, or against communism. I have a different take.<br /><br />For years, I've observed buttoned-down suburbanite neighbors zip around their gated communities in Volvos, while their urban counterparts in the subways hold half-folded copies of the New York Times in one hand and Starbucks lattes in the other as they head into the city for another day's gray labor.<br /><br />Yeah, they all seem human. But little clues tip me off that they may be the "Pod People" living among us, undetected.<br /><br />Observe the truncated and polished facial mannerisms--their lips move only a few millimeters when simulating a smile, or when assuming an expression signifying displeasure. Neither do their voices modulate much--just a fraction of a decibel separates detached caution in their voices from full-throated reserve.<br /><br />But, the dead-giveaways are those canvas tote bags in which they haul their daily rations of organic fruits, and the ceramic coffee mugs that dispense their designer coffees and teas. You can see embossed on these the secret symbol that identifies these metrosexual cyborgs to each other: "n p r."<br /><br />A parasitic entity that feeds off the lifeblood of its hard-working, taxpaying hosts, National Public Radio broadcasts messages that can be deciphered only by such artificially engineered clones. For news reports about their unwitting dupes, they perk their ears to the calm, deceptive monotony of "All Things Considered." So that they can be seen "listening" to music, they fill their office cubicles, at around volume level "3," with the restrained sounds of mostly Mozart (though never anything so gauche as Don Giovanni) and Bach (though never anything so vulgar as Stokowski's orchestration of Toccata and Fugue).<br /><br />And when these bloodless creatures return in the evenings to their ethnically cleansed, gentrified lofts, they "entertain" themselves with the gentle "humor" of Garrison Keillor's homey little corner of NPR-land, "A Prairie Home Companion." Since it requires of its listeners very little laughter, APHC provides them with further camouflage, helping them maintain the public pretense that they are actually human beings, possessing not only a sense of humor, but even souls.<br /><br />Well, anyway, that's my conspiracy theory, and I'm sticking to it. How else to explain how an oafish dullard like Keillor could convince a segment of the population that he's Mark Twain reincarnated, and that his monumentally tedious nattering about the tiresome folk of some lake in Minnesota is fraught with "irony"?<br /><br />So when I heard that Robert Altman was slated to direct this movie, I thought:  "Wow! I'm sure glad they got him to breathe some friggin' life into this dreck!" After all, Altman has graced the screen with some of its most memorable treasures, from the Burt Lancaster/Gary Cooper Western Vera Cruz (1954) to the raucous World War II flick The Dirty Dozen (1967). Two of his classics, Flight of the Phoenix (1965) and The Longest Yard (1974), have even been remade recently.<br /><br />Then, I suddenly realized: "Wait a minute, dummy: that was Robert Aldrich!  Robert Altman was the guy who directed M*A*S*H (1970), one of the few comedies in movie history that had to ride the coattails of the TV sitcom it spun off."<br /><br />Still, I decided to give this pic a chance anyhow, going in with such low expectations that I was sure to be pleasantly surprised. No dice. What I found instead was a trite, befuddled, pointless cinematic mess that made my earlier expectations seem like cockeyed optimism.<br /><br />What, you may wonder, is this movie about? Well, it's about an hour and three-quarters. Seriously, though, let's take Keillor at his word: "It's the kind of program that died fifty years ago, only someone forgot to tell the performers." For sure. In reality, it's about as authentic as the manufactured quaintness of a Cracker Barrel Restaurant: If you're not paying too close attention, or if Alzheimer's has set in, you might actually believe that the old-fashioned country crafts really are made by backwoods hillbillies, and not by slave labor in some Chinese factory.<br /><br />A Prairie Home Companion brims with allegory. Well, to be nice, let's call it that. The plot has Keillor's ensemble of Hee Haw! wannabes putting on their last show at the F. Scott Fitzgerald Theatre in St. Paul, broadcast on station WLF, which the script implies is being run by Mom and Pop from their kitchen table, and not by the governmental bureaucracy at Minnesota Public Radio. However, a real greedy Texan (Get it?), subtly named "The Axeman" (Tommy Lee Jones), wants to shut them down. Oh, if only some angel in the wings would waft in as the Axeman cometh, putting all his greedy, budget-cutting Evil to a halt, so that Keillor could continue to delight audiences (Podiences?) in perpetuity...<br /><br />To convince his listeners--and hopefully, the dreaded Axeman--Keillor and crew put on a show to end all shows. Truly. I've never seen such an ensemble of gifted and acclaimed thespians acting their hearts out: Kevin Kline, Woody Harrelson, and Meryl Streep give inspired performances.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they are inspired performances of an excruciatingly amateurish script. I think Keillor learned his screenwriting craft from one of those correspondence courses that they advertise on matchbook covers. The dialogue is embarrassingly stilted, the character development utterly absent. The confused staging is filmed by director of photography Edward Lachman, a one-note Johnny who appears to have learned his sole trick of moving the camera in lateral dollying--left-to-right, then right-to-left--at the Mr. Miyagi ("sand the floor") School of Cinematography.<br /><br />Virginia Madsen plays the movie's pivotal role, a rather earthy, sensual Angel of Death who's been sent to off you-know-who. She's convincing and nuanced, but her blocking is so clumsy that if the projectionist turned off the sound, you'd swear she could be cast as a tree in one of those elementary school Thanksgiving plays that parents are forced to attend. By the end of the movie, I found myself screaming inwardly at Madsen: "Kill this movie! Drive a stake through its heart! For the love of Christ, release me from this tedium!"<br /><br />So the NPR Pod People have now invaded The Cinema, too. And even though the film was screened only at "select" venues that run independent films, dozens of rave reviews from captive critics proclaim A Prairie Home Companion a shoo-in for a load of Oscar nominations.<br /><br />Will these alien invaders succeed in their takeover of our planet? Not if we act now! It's still not too late to put up blockades and prevent trucks from delivering DVDs of this life-sucking movie to video stores in our hometowns. For if we don't, Kevin McCarthy's doomed prophesies from the original Body Snatchers may still come to pass:<br /><br />"Look, you fools. You're in danger. Can't you see? They're after you! They're after all of us! Our wives! Our children, everyone! They're here already! YOU'RE NEXT!"</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>The late Robert Altman, a director praised up and down for his successes in writing and directing, has left us (or at least me) in a bit of a shock.  `A Prairie Home Companion', which deserved me due to its countless rave reviews, failed to illicit even the slightest vein of interest in me.  In all actuality if it weren't for Meryl's spectacular acting ability I would have most likely turned the film off before the credits began to role.  There is no denying that Meryl Streep is a brilliantly gifted actress, and if she receives an Oscar nod for this film I will completely understand for her ditzy Yolanda was the best part of this borefest.  Not only was this film boring but it becomes increasingly ridiculous with its side plots of angels of death that just further prove my distaste for this movie.  The acting was surprisingly good, all except for Kevin Kline and Virginia Madsen who just come off bland and completely uninterested with their roles, and thus we, the viewer, become less and less interested.  I just can't muster up much of anything to say about this movie that won't border negativity unless it's concerning Meryl so I'll end this review with:<br /><br /> "So many love this, I don't understand why, I couldn't bare to watch it again, so average movie watcher beware, this film is not all it's raved up to be."</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>I wish I'd said this: A Prairie Home Companion is a lovely film about death, and with some great bad jokes. Death and how we deal with it drifts through the film like a dream, but it turns out to be real. Word has gotten around that the 30-year-old radio program is giving its last show. The theater where it has been broadcast from all these years has been sold and will be turned into a parking lot. A woman in a white trench coat moves dream-like through the place, searching for a person whose time has come, and then finds him. And then she finds another. Memories of past successes are talked about, but sometimes not. Reminiscences are wept over or laughed over. The backstage emergencies happen and are dealt with and the radio show goes on. It's just a marvelous movie. People who dislike the actual A Prairie Home Companion will probably not like this movie. Those who do like the radio show I'm sure are going to run out and buy the DVD of the movie as soon as it's available.<br /><br />Garrison Keillor is not center stage so much as he's the imperturbable head guy who isn't always there, even when he's there. Most of the regular members of the radio show are present, as well as some new names. Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep are incredibly authentic and incredibly funny/poignant as the two remaining members, Rhonda and Yolanda Johnson, of a country-music family singing group. Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly are great as the dim cowboys, Lefty and Dusty. Their bad-jokes song is one of the highlights. Guy Noir looking like Kevin Kline tries to keep a lid on the crises. Streep and Tomlin (and Harrelson and Reilly) sing their own stuff and they are first class. Tomlin, in particular, gives a terrific performance as Rhonda, tough, funny, a little bitter and a trooper.<br /><br />After 105 minutes you may find death not too frightening, may find a kind of comforting acceptance of life, and may find funny some awful jokes...like the name of the country song Lefty sang on last week's show, "I'll Give You My Moonshine If You Show Me Your Jugs." Or a great new wheezer, "Did you hear about the crate of Viagra that was stolen?" "No! Who took it?" "The cops don't know but they're looking for hardened criminals."<br /><br />I also wish I'd said this, from the New York Times: A Prairie Home Companion isn't great, it's wonderful.</p></br><a href="../users/A6FIAB28IS79.html">A6FIAB28IS79</a><br/><p>No movie has packed more punch than Robert Altman's "Nashville" as a criticism of life, a chilling yet exhilarating dissection of a culture incapable of living the examined life. Altman was in control with that film, seizing upon a "real" place as a microcosmic landscape of mid-1970's America, then orchestrating the actions of characters who ironically have lost their place. But Garrison Keillor is himself the personification of control, a highly skilled literary and dramatic artist not the least of whose creations is the wise and witty persona serving as host of his faux-retro radio show, which is his own criticism of life.<br /><br />Altman captures Keillor's cosmos, but nowhere does it acquire the life-like authenticity of "Nashville," "The Player," or "Gosford Park." The ironies that Altman's camera normally exposes have already been attended to by another ironist of undeniable brilliance. This is Keillor country, ordered exactly as its creator writes, acts, narrates, and sings it. I've attended a broadcast of "Prairie Home Companion" and found it curiously distant and unengaging, my presence and that of the rest of the audience serving as props, or a bit of window dressing, for the purpose of establishing the show's credibility for a home audience. In fact, the entire premise of the movie is absurd--the last broadcast of a folksy variety radio show that was never more than a contrived simulation from the start. As a place, Nashville took itself seriously. By contrast, Keillor's "Prairie Home Companion" has the feeling of those small town renovations with anachronistic gas lanterns, pricey soda fountains and quaint antique shops. It's clever, even artful, kitsch, yet Keillor makes it work, often putting his finger on what is most genuine and real, the repressed stuff of consciousness suddenly taking on a welcome familiarity.<br /><br />One of the throwaway jokes in the film turns out to be a matter of life and death: One penguin asks another, "Why do you appear to be wearing a tuxedo?" The other penguin answers,"Why would you think I'm not?"  No matter that the joke was responsible for the angel of death who shadows the characters in the show; it's also a reminder that there's no reason we shouldn't trust Keillor's sleight of hand.  "Reality radio show" or not, "Prairie Home Companion" becomes the stage for a strangely compelling essay on time and change, chance and paradox, the presence of  absence (the bust of F. Scott Fitzgerald).  The final scene of the film is lifted from Ingmar Bergman's "The Seventh Seal," when the angel of death walks in on the diners, assembled this time not at a Knight's castle at Elsinore but at Mickey's Cafe in St. Paul.  It's a deeply affecting moment, one that moreover has the effect of bringing the audience in on Keillor's literary conceit--an inclusion I missed when I attended the actual production. Keillor shares with Altman cynicism about many features of the present mediascape as well as an elegiac attitude toward a gentler, more cohesive American community.  Like the reader who's finished James Joyce's "The Dead," the spectator at the end of this film is at one with a human community of equals, embraced by the ties that bind.<br /><br />As a movie "A Prairie Home Companion" is at once more lively, colorful and honest than it is as a variety show.  Altman serves Keillor well, no less than Meryl Streep serves the director, enabling him to compose shots that are too warm and glowing to be forgettable images merely.  In fact, in her second appearance on the show within the show, Streep's singing a song about her childhood past reprises and nearly equals the soulful, heart-stirring moment in "Nashville" when Ronee Blakey performs the song "Dues."<br /><br />Perhaps this film, which is at once archetypal and particular, allegorical and human, will be the octogenarian filmmaker's farewell.  Deep down, however, I hope that a film we might regard as Keillor's film-directing debut doesn't wind up being Altman's swan song. There's got to be another "Nashville" in the protean imagination of the great director--perhaps like Shakespeare's "The Tempest" a film allowing him a fitting valediction to his cinematic magic while ushering us into a brave new world.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>Robert Altman turns Garrison Keillor's long-running radio show into a truly unique experience. In less capable hands, this celluloid translation could have been disastrous. However, Altman is the perfect filmmaker to capture Keillor's musical and storytelling charm. An impressive cast (Woody Harrelson, Kevin Kline, Lindsay Lohan, John C. Reilly, Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin) complements Keillor's radio ensemble with their comedic and vocal talents. Though a bit pretentious at times (Virginia Madsen's "Dangerous Woman" gradually wears out her welcome), Altman and Keillor maintain a comfortable tone of lighthearted nostalgia. Not for all tastes, but a must for any "Prairie Home Companion" listener.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KMG1AIUS00DC.html">A1KMG1AIUS00DC</a><br/><p>Since 1974, the radio show "A Prairie Home Companion" has been broadcast from St. Paul, Minnesota.  The brainchild of Garrison Keillor, the show has been a fixture of National Public Radio for years, usually airing on Saturdays from 5 to 7 P.M. Central Time.  Its current home is the Fitzgerald Theatre (formerly the World).  Each show features a storytelling monologue from Keillor, claiming to be a report from his fictitious home of Lake Wobegon, "the little town that time forgot and the decades cannot improve."  The show also includes folksy music of the Grand Ole Opry school and commercials for such fictitious products as Powdermilk Biscuits, Bebop-a-reebop Rhubarb Pie, Jack's Warm Car Service, and Bertha's Kitty Boutique.<br /> Turning the radio show into a movie was the task of director Robert Altman ("M*A*S*H," "Gosford Park"), known for his ability to elicit improvisational performances from his actors, create intriguing ensemble casts, and put his personal, inimitable stamp on his films.  "A Prairie Home Companion" entered theatres like a whisper, rather than with the huge publicity push that accompanies most new movies.  And that seems appropriate for such a low-key, gentle film.  Like the radio show, the movie focuses on spirited entertainment but also gives us revealing glimpses of backstage relationships as the stars and technical crew discuss their personal lives, reminisce about their careers or simply allow us to savor their eccentric characters.<br /> The premise of the movie is that "A Prairie Home Companion" is solely a local broadcast and this one is its last.  A mixture of nostalgia, sentiment, steely show biz acceptance, and nonchalance pervades the wings of the theatre.<br /> GK (Keillor) is the emcee and host of the show.  His singing stars are the Johnson sisters, Yolanda (Meryl Streep) and Rhonda (Lily Tomlin) and the cowboy duo Lefty (John C. Reilly) and Dusty (Woody Harrelson), who incorporate endless bad jokes into their routine.  Lola (Lindsay Lohan) is Yolanda's daughter, a young woman who writes poems about suicide but is able to pitch in on stage when the need arises.<br /> Though Altman integrates his cast nicely, editing their private moments with the onstage show being aired, Keillor comes off as its heart.  He maintains his down-home manner and Everyman face throughout, never breaking character.  His on-air personality and real personality are essentially interchangeable, and he sails through the show's swan song performance with expert timing.<br /> Tomlin is just wonderful as Rhonda, who has spent a lifetime in show business but never really hit the big time, resigned and content to earn a living doing what she likes best.  Her comments about the business ring true because she assesses her audience, her coworkers, and even her family with biting accuracy.<br /> Streep's Yolanda is the dreamy one.  Lost in her own world, when we first see her check in backstage, she has the misty-eyed look of a woman attending her tenth high school reunion.  She is entering another time, another place, and she has always felt the thrill of being on the verge of a performance.  Streep looks as if she's having a ball dreaming, commenting on her family ("We're like the Carters ... only not famous"), and waxing nostalgic.<br /> We like these people because of their complete lack of pretension.  You feel that if you met them at the supermarket, they'd be exactly the same.  I'm sure this is what Altman strove to achieve, and he does it almost completely.<br /> Where he fails, I think, is in two characters:  the Dangerous Woman (Virginia Madsen) and Guy Noir (Kevin Kline).  Noir is a recurring character on the Home Companion radio shows -- a 1940's gumshoe detective.  In the film, he's made the show's security guy.  Dressed in striped suit and speaking in Warner Brothers gangster flick dialogue, he is entirely out of synch with the rest of the film.  While the cast members have eccentricities of their own, his seems closer to psychotic, though no one in the film seems to notice.  You never believe Guy Noir is real.  And in a film built on solid, if quirky, characters, Noir just doesn't convince.<br /> The Dangerous Woman is a mysterious, trench-coated woman seen lurking backstage, saying little.  Eventually, we understand she is a sort of angel or specter of death, hovering over both a person connected with the show and the show itself.  This symbol strikes a false note and seems an obvious attempt to help the viewer "get" the demise of an era.  We get it, Mr. Altman.<br /> Rated PG-13 for some mildly risque humor, "A Prairie Home Companion" is not for everyone.  It moves along at a moderate pace with no conspicuously big scenes, and it requires the viewer to pay attention and learn about the characters through dialogue and interaction with others.  Altman intended a look at a world not known to most of us, one in which people enjoy entertaining an appreciative -- if small -- audience and have respect and affection for one another.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>Mr. Altman is a genius, and his ability to present massive ensemble films as diverse as "Nashville", "Short Cuts", "Cookie's Fortune" and "Gosford Park" with coherence and true entertaiment value MUST be commended. Films have undergone evolutionary strides, and it's usually the rich studio heads that have damaged the industry. Radio, too, is not what it once was, though Mr. Keillor has always been a charming draw. A sad, fond farewell to the wonderful media that once were is the focus of Mr. Altman's "simple" film. I've read the other reviews, and I'm sorry that so many people just don't "get it". Mr. Keillor's radio programs, rife with wit and humor, are simple and straightforward. Mr. Altman gave Mr. Keillor this very respect by keeping the film simple, though the man, despite his years, is gleefully putting together another crazy exposition of the human condition, with the deviously humorous help of Mr. Keillor himself. What's not to love? The cast is stellar, and I was particularly amused at the scenes between Kevin Kline & Maya Rudolph. Kline's name was Noir; backstage intrigue, and an endless reference to life as it ought to be...well, I was moved and entertained.  This is NOT a simple film. Traces of "Nashville" (music), "Cookie's Fortune" (grisly humor) and "Gosford Park" (a narrow set), reminded me that Mr. Altman knows how to take a new and fresh approach to his material. I can't wait til his next film project.  UPDATE: I'm glad to have the DVD in my collection. Mr. Altman will be sorely missed. Other director's will make ensemble films, but Mr. Altman is the creator of that genre, and I hope people don't forget.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA.html">A3NH7PYU4AD5GA</a><br/><p>I have enjoyed several great Altman movies (like Nashville or Short Cuts) and many good ones. Some were less than great.<br />This one is maybe not the greatest, but surely the most loveable. The cast is superb, a few Oscar nominations should be coming up, surely for the Johnson sisters (Streep and Thomlin). Lots of great bad jokes. Some even with metaphysical consequences. What did the penguin answer again? What makes you think I don't wear a tux?<br />Kline in one of his marvellous parodies of himself tells the story, using the pseudonym Noir, appropriately.<br />And over it all watches Francis Scott Fitzgerald, resp. his bust in the theater's VIP room.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MQQI4UYT9C11.html">A2MQQI4UYT9C11</a><br/><p>My daughter must be growing up, as she sat with my wife and me, but without complaint (albeit with a friend) through this quirky and somewhat disappointing film adaptation of Garrison Keillor's popular public radio program.  The quirkiness resulted from screenwriter Keillor and director Robert Altman's decision to wrap a ghostly, pseudo-religious story around the happenings at the last broadcast of PHC, and to exclude the storytelling around Lake Woebegone that's the hallmark of the real radio show.  Some notable non-singing stars do fine jobs in singing roles--most notably Meryl Streep as aging folk singer Yolanda Johnson.  Lily Tomlin plays sister Rhonda Johnson (she mostly sings backup).  Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly have fun as The Trailhands, a couple of sometimes off-color cowboy singers.  Three big stars are wasted in the wraparound story---Kevin Kline as detective Guy Noir; the beautiful Virginia Madsen (Sideways) as the angel of death; and Tommy Lee Jones as The Axeman, representative of the Texas corporation that's bought the Fitzgerald Theatre and shut down PHC.  There are some good folksongs and funny mock-commercials (and a great radio sound effects scene).  Since Keillor wrote the story and stars in the film, you've got to believe he was happy with the outcome.  Still, I can't help feeling that it could have come out better.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>The movie version of A Prairie Home Companion is a fictionalized version of the real thing. Garrison's detective Guy Noir (played by Kevin Kline) is actually a character in the film, providing security for the weekly radio show. Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin and Woody Harrelson play fictional musicians and old-time singers. Supporting them is much of Companion's weekly crew - including The Guys All-Star Show Band, Peter Ostroushko and Tom Keith, the sound effects man. The plot is that this is the last show before the theater is sold to a wealthy Texan who plans to tear it down for a parking lot.<br /><br />I have to confess that for the first half-hour or so, I thought this movie would rely on clever, insider verbal gags. But once the characters took root, the ensemble started to click and the music started to flow, I finally relaxed and enjoyed the ride.<br /><br />Garrison Keillor is no actor. He is what he is, which is mainly a vehicle for other talented folk to strut their stuff. His show is wholesome with an edge. The movie retained that flavor, as well as some of the clean, uplifting fun that Keillor's fans have come to expect of him. Death and old-fashioned fun rub elbows in a weirdly comfortable way that generates sentiment but is too real to be maudlin. The only thing missing was Keillor's long dialogs about life in Lake Wobegon, whose name was never mentioned during the movie. Just as well - the dialogs would have interrupted the flow and made the movie about Keillor rather than his guests. Streep and Tomlin were perfect as a singing sister act. Harrelson and John C. Reilly were terrific as Lefty and Dusty, a couple of crude singing cowboys supposedly right off the range. Their extended song of horrible jokes was hilarious. Kline, ever the master of physical comedy, was comically inept as Noir. And even Lindsay Lohan was fairly masterful as Streep's nihilistic daughter Lola, whose notebooks were full of poems about suicide. Virginia Mersden was suitability grave and mysterious as "Dangerous Woman" whose presence meant peril for someone.<br /><br />I'm not entirely sure, but it certainly seemed as if everyone did their own singing. That added a great deal to the flavor and spirit of the show and of the movie. "A Prairie Home Companion" is a film with heart and soul, and successfully transfers the show's energy from radio to film. You will find yourself laughing and smiling and tapping your feet. Masterly!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Many more people are fans of Garrison Keillor's NPR radio hit, "A Prairie Home Companion" than who can describe it succinctly.  "PHC" is a show from a bygone era, where talented writers, comedians, and musicians put on a completely original two-hour show each week.  Sure, there are some stock characters and common refrains, and the subject matter may be dated (old timey music features prominently, and the show is set in low-tech, changeless Minnesota), but each show is completely unique within those parameters.  All in all, "PHC" is a time capsule showing what was good, decent, and just a wee bit naughty in Americana.<br /><br />Robert Altman's movie, "A Prairie Home Companion," is an elegy for that beloved TV show.  In a rather unbelievable set-up, a nasty Texas corporation (of course) has bought the beloved Fitzgerald Theater in downtown St. Paul and will tear down the lovely place to put up a parking lot.  And so this show that has been a home for its fans and its cast for over 30 years must say goodbye.  Altman then films the last episode, cutting away to the priceless behind-the-scenes moments when you see how these performers are a true family, and everyone's natural reaction is that "PHC" is a national treasure to be saved.  Anyone who wants to tear down this beloved institution needs a comeuppance.<br /><br />Garrison Keillor plays himself, as "GK," and he is ably assisted by a world-class cast of Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin, Kevin Klein, John C. Reilly, Woody Harrelson, and many others.  Fans of the real-life show may be a bit surprised that Keillor's regular "PHC" cast doesn't get much time to shine, but that's the way of things.  Streep and Tomlin nearly steal the show as the singing Johnson sisters - who knew they could carry these tunes?  Reilly and Harrelson are excellent personifications of Keillor's recurring cowboy characters, Lefty and Dusty, and their litany of bad jokes near the end of the show is priceless.<br /><br />Kevin Klein is a bit fuzzy as Guy Noir, Private Eye.  He's more buffoonish than his character on "PHC," but Klein pulls it off.  When describing the Dangerous Woman (Virginia Madsen, an angel), Noir waxes poetic, "She wore a Mt. Rushmore T-shirt, and those old guys never looked so good."  And Tommy Lee Jones represents the dastardly investors who want to destroy the show.<br /><br />Shot in luscious tones and with all of Altman's visual artistry, "PHC" is quite simply a beautiful film. Slow and stately, to be sure, with many ruminations on passing and death, it is not always a bright and cheerful movie.  But it is a loving one, and it is fitting that this was Altman's last film - he uses "PHC" to remind us to not spend too much time looking back or looking ahea, because there are some pretty darn good things with us in the present.</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>If you've ever listened to a radio show of A Prairie Home Companion, this will be a treat.

How will people act?  What will they say and sing?  The non-Companion listeners who are viewing may say, "who cares?"<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for "risqu&eacute; humor."

Garrison Keillor's acting skills are comparable with his superb radio voice, as he makes his big screen debut in this adaptation of his weekly show. All the other performers, as expected, are equally enjoyable. Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, and John C. Reilly really stand out. Lindsay Lohan stands out in the opposite way; as in, "what is she doing here?" She really doesn't add much to the movie and her character is kind of annoying. Similarly, Virginia Madsen's character could have been done without, but that's what makes A Prairie Home Companion a good movie and not a great one.<br /><br />Robert Altman moves the story along slowly and we really get to know all the varying characters and their eccentric personalities. The entire film has a very heartwarming feel to it, and you can tell that the entire cast, and the director really care about being there on set and making something enjoyable. Whether that something appeals to a wide market is really unimportant compared to making the film you want.<br /><br />If you like the radio show, check the movie out. If you've never heard of the radio show, you may be left wondering what's going on and why you should care. Either way, you can't really bash this movie because it's got so much to love: songs, performances, and a highly acclaimed cast.

Metaphors abound, and I have no doubt that if I sat down to watch the movie again I would find things that I missed the first time around. The most interesting character was the theater itself - and by extension the theater's ghost. Often when an all-star cast such as the one in this movie is assembled, the resulting production often feels like a mess of egos.

Two Hours of Magic. Tomlin and Streep (The Johnson Girls) are joined by Kevin Kline (Guy Noir), John Reilly (Lefty), Woody Harrelson (Dusty), Tommy Lee Jones (The Axeman), and Robin and Linda Williams, playing themselves as regular bluegrass performers on Mr. Keillor's (he wrote the screenplay by the way) radio show--here on Station WLT which stands for "with lettuce and tomato"-- along with a host of other fine performers. There is not a dog in the lot.<br /><br />The plot is thin. After thirty years, Mr. Keillor is doing his last "Prairie Home Companion" show. The theatre has been sold and will be razed for a parking lot. (It is no secret that there are those in the U. S. Congress whose mission by cutting off funding, is to eliminate public radio, the home of "A Prairie Home Companion.) The Axeman (Tommy Lee Jones) cometh; but he falls into the clutches of the beautiful, blond Angel of Death; and he goeth. Lefty and Dusty crack a series of jokes so awful that they are funny, Streep and Keillor's version of the A. P. Carter standard "Gold Watch and Chain is not to be missed, and Robin and Linda Williams play and sing beautiful bluegrass music. Unlike many comedians whose humor is ugly and mean, Keillor and Tomlin are always gentle even as they poke fun at all our foibles and are a joy to watch.<br /><br />When all the news just repeats inself-- the fighting in Iraq has now gone on longer than World War Two and the past week marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of the first AIDS case that was reported in Los Angeles in 1981, with millions dead and millions more infected and no end in sight, we needed this film.

They play off one another as if they are really sisters. They come across<br /><br />as so natural. Lindsay Lohen plays Streep's daughter - she's a talented singer too, but very different.<br /><br />Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly steal the movie though with their hysterical characters, Dusty and Lefty. The lyrics of their<br /><br />songs are far to dirty and off-color for radio.<br /><br />Even though the script and directing are really great, because of the outstanding cast this really is an "Actors" movie.<br /><br />The actors in this movie are so brilliant, it is just amazing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>Prairie Home Companion starts out with a loyal fan base: Older middle agers, people who love live radio & fans of the actual show. The problem with this group is they don't go to the movies much. This will do well in dvd sales & pay for view tv. Anyway, I'm a fan & have seen it. It's behind the scenes look at the radio show, with lots of stars playing the characters of a typical show. Kevin Kline is Guy Noir, the house dick & narrator of the thread-bare plot: closing night of the long running, live radio show. Woody Harrelson is Dusty, a cowboy singing lewd country western. Has Meryl Strepp ever had a bad performance? She's fabulous here at turns funny, sad & can really sing. She is Yolanda, part of a sister act with Lily Tomlin as Rhonda. There are so many more & a few cameos.  Even the angel of death, played by a beautiful Virginia Madsen, shows up in a fantasy bit, to claim a cast member. Over it all is Garrison Keilor (GK) with running gags, off-beat songs & commercial spoofs. Robert Altman directed with a light hand & this is much like the original radio show, which is still running. This can be viewed by all ages but kids may get bored.  It is funny through-out if you have developed a sense of humor. I look forward to the dvd which I am sure will have lots of extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>With Robert Altman's passing this week, A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION is a fitting swan song for the acclaimed director.  It has his trademark realistic dialogue and without any flashy effects he focuses on the characters.  Based on Garrison Keillor's real life story, the movie shows us the last night for the live radio broadcast of the countrified PHC, replete with awful commercial jingles and some choice scene stealing.  Keillor himself plays GK, the show's host and mentor; his performance is as down home as the story.  Kevin Kline plays the bumbling security chief, Guy Noir, and he is good too.  Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin shine as the Johnson Girls, relics from the past whose vocal harmonies are reminiscent of earlier bluegrass queens, and whose performances are marvelous.  Streep can do anything and she has a good singing voice to boot.  Lindsay Lohan eschews her typical teenie role with her portrayal of Streep's suicide-obsessed daughter who gets her big night to shine as well; L. Q. Jones delivers a small but effective turn as a country singer on his last notes, literally; Virginia Madsen is the mysterious dangerous woman who is really the angel of death; Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly are a hoot as cowboy singers whose songs are purely awful; and Tommy Lee Jones is the corporate axeman who has come to see the last show.  It's all light stuff, but Altman handles it well and it's my favorite Altmqn film, after MASH.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>The End of Radio Days:<br /><br />Robert Altman made this Comedy / Drama / Variety Show based on the real-life radio program which is called..."A Prairie Home Companion". The real show's host Garrison Keillor, wrote the screenplay and played GK, the host in the movie. The movie depicts the final broadcast of the show. It will be canceled by a mega corporation that bought the radio station and the building will be torn down to give the space for the new parking lot. As always in Altman movie, a cast is terrific and includes Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin, Lindsay Lohan, John C. Reilly, Tommy Lee Jones, Virginia Madsen and Kevin Kline. There are many songs performed by the show regulars and I truly enjoyed singing by Streep and Tomlin as the sisters Yolanda and Rhonda Johnson. Their on-screen timing and delivery of the famous Altman's overlapping dialogs are one of the movie's greatest pleasures. Dusty and Lefty (Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly), two cowboy singers making fun of each other with the deadly serious faces were hilarious and their never ending song "Bad Jokes" was a scream. I wanted them to be on the screen longer. I would not call "A Prairie Home Companion" one of the best Altman's movies - it is not. There were some characters and elements of plot that seemed either under-developed or not necessary. As much as I like Kevin Klein, his Private Eye working for the show, Guy Noir seemed out of place. Beautiful and mysterious woman in white (Virginia Madsen) brings to mind not just one but two movies, "Wings of Desire" and "City of Angels". Well, the appearance of an Angel during the last ever broadcast seems to be justified. Shows like people go through the circle of life from birth to death but sadly, Madsen has not much to play. Not as great as "Nashville", the last (and sadly it IS his last) Altman's movie dedicated to Country music is still charming and quirky and I am glad that I saw it.<br /><br />3.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>The key to enjoying this film is to remember that it is not a documentary but a rendering of a fictional last performance of the radio program, but that's hard to remember when Garrison Keillor plays himself--singing, telling stories, and peddling make believe commercials with dead pan seriousness. The live radio variety show that many people enjoyed is one thing; this film loosely based upon it is another. Without that connection this film would never stand on its own. After thirty years the Soderbergs sold the building to wealthy Texans, and thus the show's final act. The two Johnson sisters, Yolanda and Rhonda (played by Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin), reminisce backstage while the show plays live in the background. Country cowboys Dusty and Lefty yuck it up. A woman who is really an angel, a death backstage during the broadcast, and a visit by one of the new investors disrupt the story line. But watching "GK," as he is called in this film, is always a treat.</p></br><a href="../users/A146H6A41B26QT.html">A146H6A41B26QT</a><br/><p>I'm a big Altman fan, and I was looking for something with his usual bite, but for some reason this film fell flat for me. Altman's usual star-studded cast re-enacts a fictional last performance of the well-known show, but it was just a bit too real to be satiric and a bit too silly to be real. Usually Altman films leave me feeling a shock of recognition--this is how life really is--messy, unfair, tragic but wonderful. "Nashville" (one of my all-time favorite films),"Short Cuts" and "The Player" come to mind. Maybe this film just felt safe and a little boring--maybe there was just too much hokey music. Maybe you have to be a fan of PHC to enjoy it--I'm not. Disappointing!</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>The things I had heard about A Prairie Home Companion were positive ones. No one seemed to gush over the movie and no one called it an "absolute must-see." All of the thoughts I heard or read seemed to portray A Prairie Home Companion as a GOOD movie. And that is what it was. A Prairie Home Companion is a hearty, meat and potatoes, stick-to-your-ribs kind of good movie. The movie may be overflowing with highlights personal to you, but from a broader perspective I would only list one highlight. It wasn't "that kind of movie." Rather than a story about a radio show airing its last broadcast, it was a heartwarming story about a band of radio personalities giving their final performance. The focus was the people.<br /><br />The movie was a look into their lives. They tell stories, some for the first time, with others they've lost count. They laugh. They cry. They are a family. And while the stories may not be familiar to us, the faces sure are.<br /><br />The cast includes Woody Harrelson, Tommy Lee Jones, Garrison Keillor, Kevin Kline, Lindsay Lohan, Virginia Madsen, John C. Reilly, Maya Rudolph, Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin, Marylouise Burke and L.Q. Jones. Surely you've heard one or two of those names! So many names, some bigger than others. It was nice to see so many people be a part of a movie like this when many of the roles were limited. Try to argue all you want that there aren't big names in that list, but I will fight you there.<br /><br />Oh, and before I forget: that highlight I mentioned earlier. Kevin Kline. If you are a fan of Mr. Kline, I probably won't need to elaborate. If you have seen the movie, then you may even agree. This guy is magic. I loved the part he played as Guy Noir, the short-of-work 1930s private eye stuck manning security for the theater. As he spoke, whether it be conversationally or in narration to the movie, he did so in an overly dramatic style characterized decades ago by men and women in film. In the DVD extras, director Robert Altman talks admiringly about Kline. He says that the camera has to be on Kline's body rather than zoom in because he plays his parts with his entire body. Think about that after watching one of his movies if you don't believe it. The man is talented, and his performance was the highlight for me.<br /><br />I liked A Prairie Home Companion. It was fun to hear some of the ridiculous jingles that the performers had to sing. It was a pleasure to be let into the lives of the characters facing the end of the careers they loved so deeply. And it was a riot to hear some of the jokes. A Prairie Home Companion may never see an award from the Academy, but please do not limit your movie watching based upon that metric.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION is not without merit. It is a quality production and there are some nice little quirky moments, but the problem I had is the same problem I have with a lot of Altman's films of this kind.<br /><br />Most noteably: The Company & Ready to Wear. The PLAYER, being the only exception.<br /><br />There is a tremendous disjointed feeling. Watching the film is like going to a party alone and you don't know anybody and nobody is nice enough to introduce themselves, or more appropriately, being allowed to go back stage of a radio show and nobody cares that you're there. Everybody is talking about random events and things and eventually, you find yourself not caring and find yourself trying to balance an olive and toothpick on your chin.<br /><br />The movie is, in my opinion, too real. Four or five people talking all at the same time. Lindsay Lohan reading a magazine. The characters are quirky and cool to see, but in the same note, 1 dimensional and unexplored.<br /><br />That is why I say ALTMAN is an aquired taste. Many may have the patience to sit through this movie and enjoy it fully. It has nostalgia. Class. High quality entertainers. The camera is constantly at a prespective that leads you to believe you are watching real events playing out in real time.  And still, I found myself bored to death within 30 minutes.<br /><br />Why is this considered to be one of the great films of the year? Beyond me. Maybe it's the respect for Altman? or the slews of A-list actors that love to do his movies, but to me, I'd rather be reading a book or playing with my kids then wasting 2 hours with the PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION. Sorry.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>I'm here to discredit a rumor that seems to be surfacing on this site. According to some in order to enjoy this movie, you must be a fan of the radio show. I'm going to confess something. I've never listen to or even heard of the radio show before this movie came out. And you know what? I love, absolutely love, "A Prairie Home Companion". So what happened? I thought only fans of the radio show were suppose to like this movie.<br /><br /> That argument is so ridiculous. So in order to like Altman's "Nashville" you'd have to like country music? Or if you enjoyed "The Company", you must love ballet? I'm not much of a country music fan or a ballet fan, yet I enjoyed both films.<br /><br /> "A Prairie Home Companion" is not just a movie about a radio show. It is a film about a forgotten era. It is about reflections of the past and the uncertainity that the future brings.<br /><br /> G.K.'s (Garrison Keillor) radio show, A Prairie Home Companion, is about to end. The movie starts on the last broadcast of the show. Everyone backstage seems a little sad. Here's a show that's been on the air for 30 years, and in a few moments, it's all going to come to an end. But for some reason Keillor is not sad. Or at least he's not showing it. So instead he goes on with the show's program. Which includes various music acts ranging from a sister team, The Johnsons (Meryl Streep and Lilly Tomlin) to a team of singers with an affection for bad jokes (Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly). But lots is going on backstage. Molly (Maya Rudolph), one of the stagehands, is expecting a baby. Guy Noir (Kevin Klein) is the head of security, but seems stuck in a 40's noir film (which helps confirms the film's sense of an era gone by). And a mysterious woman (Virginia Madsen) lurks around. Also Lola Johnson, Streep's daughter (Lindsay Lohan) sticks around for the radio show's last broadcast.<br /><br /> This material is just perfect for Altman's style of moviemaking. As I understand it, this was really a Garrison Keillor project that Altman joined onto. But, Altman makes the film his own. His handling of the material is as comfortable as a worn out shoe. If you recall his last film, "The Company", it had a sense of a documentary. So does this film.<br /><br /> Many people will argue this isn't Altman's best. Perhaps, but the movie is made in the tradition of his best works. And as far as I'm conerned, this is one of the year's best films.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Robert Altman's look at a forgotten era is one of the year's best film. The movie is made in the tradition of Altman's best work. Has a documentary feel to it.</p></br><a href="../users/AXOS8IWBXNZGT.html">AXOS8IWBXNZGT</a><br/><p>It's a quirky Robert Altman film. (Perhaps that's redundant?) Altman films tend to be more about character and setting, rather than plot, and he succeeds best when he does manage to squeeze in some kind of plot. He doesn't really manage this here. So, the result is a good set piece, showing the last day in the life of a radio show, and its characters. Altman's films do really allow you to connect with the characters, and this is no exception, so this is a medium hit on that basis. Meryl Streep's here, and so is Lindsay Lohan, so it kind of balances out.</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>I've never listened to "A Prairie Home Companion" radio program. Oh, I was aware of it, to be sure, and I've seen Garrison Keillor on TV shows. Our family lived in North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa when we were younger and both my brother and sister have said that I just had to listen to this radio program. They listened primarily for the stories and said that these stories represented our kind of people. Well, I've heard him relate some pretty amusing stories on TV, but I never did get around to listening to his radio program. Alas, my regret. In any case, I was looking through the ultra-bargain DVD bins at a Ross store and found the "A Prairie Home Companion" DVD. I bought it and my wife and I viewed it last night. I might add that she was totally unaware of the radio show or the movie about it's supposed closing day.<br /><br />It's an interesting movie. It's fiction, and is a story of the last  Prairie Home Companion radio show before the venue where they broadcast it from is torn down. The show is done before a live audience and there's a lot of footage of preparation and behind-the-scenes activity. It's interesting. I had no idea a radio programs could be so complicated and involve so many characters. There's live music, really bad jokes, corny commercials and a host of other activities, including a back-stage death while the show is on the air. One thing I missed about the movie, and would have most liked to have seen, is Garrison Keillor telling some of his funny yarns. In any case, the movie was very worthwhile viewing but would probably be much more suited viewing for a Prairie Home Companion fan, rather than for someone who has never listened to the program.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/A22VNXHU6IZ5MT.html">A22VNXHU6IZ5MT</a><br/><p>This was the final film Robert Altman directed!!! Like usual it has a large ensemble cast!!! R.I.P. Robert Altman,we'll miss ya,your were a ground breaking director!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>"A Prairie Home Companion" is a fictionalized story of the famous radio show's very last performance.  The movie covers the show itself, hosted by Garrison Keillor (playing himself), the goings on backstage, and a little action before and after the show.  Besides having to deal with a corporate axeman (Jones) who is there to officially pull the plug, they have to deal with a death mid-show and a mysterious woman (Madsen), who wanders about backstage.  On stage, three skit characters from the real radio show come to life: Guy Noir (Kline), and the cowboy singing duo of Dusty (Harrelson) and Lefty (Reilly).  Other characters are a combination real and fictional people).<br /><br />This film is a slightly skewed view into the world of Garrison Keillor (he wrote the screenplay) and his famous radio show.  It is a "nice" movie, that will amuse most who see it.  Keillor's and director Robert Altman's styles seem to be made for each other, and this film works well to give an insight into the radio show.  Performances are solid all around, especially Keillor's.  He is the glue that holds this all together.  I recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>It's an amusing mixture of fiction and reality. The `last broadcast' of America's radio show hosted by "G. K." real Garrison Keillor is deftly directed by Robert Altman with an on-stage show that features celebrated Hollywood actors including Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin, Woody Harrelson, John C. Reilly, L.Q. Jones and Lindsay Lohan, and the show's real cast and musicians. "A Prairie Home Companion" is all about the radio show of the title in the Fitzgerald Theater affectionately depicted by Altman.<br /><br />There is not much to tell in the film except that as a certain big company bought the radio station of the town, and it will be the last show for everyone tonight. A mysterious lady in white (Virginia Madsen) shows up before the PI named "Guy Noir" (Kevin Kline playing the character of the real radio show), and back stories of a few characters are told or suggested (most memorably about the Johnson sisters played by Streep and Tomlin), but nothing big or surprising happens here.<br /><br />Robert Altman's approach is very simple. Though cowboy singers Dusty and Lefty (Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly) are very funny, some may find the entire story slow and boring. I don't blame it. After all, the film is not about the story.<br /><br />Or not even exactly about the radio show of the title. Like he did in "The Player" he mixes reality with fantasy, and blurs the thin line dividing them to the extent of surrealism. Kline's Guy Noir walks and talks in a slightly exaggerated way against the reality-based background of radio show. Lohan's character casually uses cell phone in the 1950-ish diner as if breaking the entire atmosphere. Even a dead person (or angel) arrives and can talk to mortals. It's Robert Altman, director of fantastic "MASH" and "Gosford Park" and, well, awful "Popeye." His touch could be double-edged, but I think it works in "A Prairie Home Companion."<br /><br />Altman is always good at handling ensemble cast, and here he shows it again. Using HD cameras that move as if floating in the air, the director guides us through the theater, on stage and at the backstage, and lets us meet the people there. He gives everyone of his ensemble cast a chance to shine, and successfully captures their moment which are sweet, bitter, or both. The film is a tribute to the good, old days that are going, with the tenderly drawn portrait of the people facing the final curtain of their life.</p></br></body></html>

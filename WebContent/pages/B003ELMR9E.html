He often will not even say a word; the tension looms as a coil ready to spring.  Pacino generates interest, speaking or silent.<p>In "Insomnia" Pacino plays a well known but highly troubled Los Angeles detective assigned with partner Marty Dawson to travel to a small Alaskan town to help solve a murder which has local police baffled.  When he arrives Pacino is overwhelmed when energetic rookie officer Hilary Swank, determined to be the best in her profession, idolizes him to the point of knowing his cases and even notable quotes, in the manner of a baseball fan knowing the statistics and famous games of a favorite player.<p>Alaska is known for its seemingly interminable alternating periods of sun and darkness.  Pacino arrives during the sun period.  As a result, he finds it impossible to sleep.  As the story develops we learn that it is more than the sun, however, bothering Pacino.  His own past and present career as an officer reside in indefinite turmoil.<p>Pacino is in Alaska to solve the murder of an attractive 17-year-old girl.  When suspicion shifts from her abrasive, physically abusive high school boyfriend to a local older pulp mystery writer, the story heats up.<p>When Pacino and police cohorts are seeking to corner the murder suspect in a field shrouded in fog, Pacino unleashes a shot and kills his partner.  He is happy to leave the impression that the retreating suspect killed his Los Angeles police sidekick, but his world is jolted when, during one of his many sleepless nights, he receives a call from the detective writer, who reveals that he saw Pacino fire the shot that killed his partner.<p>Robin Williams, who made his mark in rollicking comedy, turns in a superb effort as the troubled writer who believes that, by making a compact with Pacino, they can both emerge free of suspicion.  The wily but troubled Williams theorizes that all Pacino needs to do is direct suspicion back to the boyfriend, pretend to solve the case, and return to Los Angeles, leaving him unscathed with a patsy being convicted of the crime.  He explains that he did not really mean to kill the young woman anymore than Pacino meant to kill his partner.  Accordingly, they should both be free of any taint of guilt. <p>The picture and the blackmail offer from Williams becomes more complicated when it is revealed that Pacino was being investigated by the internal affairs department in Los Angeles and believed his own partner would be a crucial element in bringing him down.  So did he or did he not kill his partner deliberately?  Does Pacino ultimately know?<p>The imaginative script by Hilary Seitz keeps viewers guessing until its conclusion.  Swink, a recent Best Actress Oscar winner, does a superb job as the gung ho small town Alaska police officer who begins figuring things out on her own pertaining to both Pacino and Williams.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>As the puzzle of the murder starts to unravel, so too, does the protagonist.  To the point where his judgment is impaired by his lack of sleep and the line between right and wrong is blurred.  <p>Al Pacino is so convincing in his role, that anyone who has suffered insomnia should be able to relate.<p>To top off Pacino's performance was the brilliant casting of lovable Robin Williams as the antagonist!

In the thriller "Insomnia," director Christopher Nolan examines the myriad faces of evil and the far-reaching effects of wrongdoing, whether perpetrated straightforwardly as a heinous crime, or in the ill conceived notion of subverting the law in a quest for justice.  But he also looks beyond the objectivity of premeditation at how certain physical variables can subjectively affect the psychological aspects of the duplicity.  Specifically, what happens to the body-- and especially to the mind-- when deprived of sleep for an extended period of time.  And especially when it comes at a critical juncture; at a time when, above all else, the mind must be absolutely clear and sharp, when judgments must be passed and decisions made.  Can a web of deceit, woven amid a struggle between the mind and the body, stand fast?  And if so, for how long?  How long can one prevail against the proclivities of human nature, in a place where the sun never sets, and the mind cannot find rest.<p> L.A. detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino), and his partner, Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan), have been given a special assignment:  The investigation of the murder of a seventeen-year-old girl in the small town of Nightmute, Alaska.  Their detail comes on the heels of a certain internal affairs investigation currently being conducted within the L.A.P.D., which may involve the high-profile Dormer, a good cop who has been putting away the bad guys for more years than he can remember.  And if the I.A. affair goes south, some criminals Dormer has been instrumental in convicting may see freedom.  So the change of venue for the detectives comes at an auspicious time; sometimes distance can be a good thing.<p> Dormer goes into the case with the confidence provided him by years on the job.  He is lucid, and on top of things immediately.  What he finds in Nightmute, however, is a killer who is not only meticulous, but who has a wild card up his sleeve and begins to play it not long after Dormer hits town.  It's the time of year when the sun never sets, and the killer realizes that it is going to affect Dormer's sleep, and subsequently, his perceptions and actions.  And he's determined to help the situation along with some untimely phone calls and some well chosen words.  Dormer's onto the game immediately, but after a couple of days of sleeplessness, his mental faculties begin to deteriorate, and it leads to a situation involving Eckhart that puts an entirely new spin on the matters at hand.  Things get sticky, and Dormer's judgment becomes questionable.  He struggles to keep himself together, because he knows one thing for certain:  The killer has crossed a line from which there is no return, and he's going to kill again.  And it's up to Dormer to stop him before it happens.<p> As with his previous effort, "Memento," Christopher Nolan has crafted and delivered a film that is emotionally stirring and initially, at least, devoid of any absolutes (or if there are any, they are soon lost in Dormer's sleeplessness induced mental haze), to which he adds a moral dilemma that makes it all entirely involving and which successfully draws the audience into the action as the story unfolds.  it becomes an incisive character study that affords you Dormer's perspective while allowing you to experience his situation seemingly first hand.  Nolan gradually takes you from the rational thought processes that to Dormer are the norm, to the murky regions of the ambiguous into which he descends as the sleeplessness overcomes and overwhelms him.  And the fact that Dormer's impaired mental state is so significant-- inasmuch as the direction it takes the story-- makes this a rather unique film; it's an interesting angle, and quite different from the usual considerations offered by the typical crime/thriller/drama.  Most importantly, Nolan knows how to present it effectively, and builds the tension in direct proportion to Dormer's descent, which maintains that necessary edge right up to the climax.<p> By the end of the film, Pacino/Dormer really looks as though he hasn't slept in days; it's a critical aspect of the story, upon which the credibility of the film depends, and which it achieves, without question.  Some credit has to go to the make-up provided by Gitte Axen, but ultimately, what makes this film so convincing-- and such an unqualified success-- is Al Pacino's performance.  As he demonstrates here, he is arguably one of the top two leading actors in the business (the other being De Niro).  He has the ability to create a completely new character with every new film, and he's always convincing, whether taking it over-the-top (Tony Montana, "Scarface"; Vincent Hanna, "Heat"), using a more introspective approach (Michael Corleone, "The Godfather") or finding the necessary reserve that fits a particular character and makes him believable (as he does here with Will Dormer).  This is a studied portrayal, presented in subtle shadings and tone, and one that should easily earn him an Oscar nomination.<p> Turning in a solid performance, also, is Robin Williams, who seems to be taking a page out of Pacino's book by finding the kind of restraint he needed to make his character work.  Williams has played a variety of roles in his career, but never has he played so against type as his portrayal of Walter Finch in this film; and he does it well.  He's entirely convincing-- his Finch is very real and disquietingly believable, in that his outward appearance is so normal, while in reality he is capable of deeds most vile.  His true nature is undetectable, and as such, he's your worst nightmare.  It makes Dormer's conundrum even more pronounced, and helps to make "Insomnia" a riveting and thoroughly engrossing film.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>A follow up to the critical pleaser `Memento', `Insomnia' shows that Christopher Nolan isn't perfect.  In fact, this is the glitch in his fimography; a list of impressive feats that circle around an impressive re-imagining of Batman and some intriguing sci-fi ventures.  `Insomnia' has some superb moments, and facets of this film are truly strong, but overall there is a feeling of apathy that surrounds my concluding sentiments on the film itself.<br /><br />The idea here (of a LA cop lost in Alaskan daylight as he searches for a killer) has potential, and Nolan tries to uncover that potential, but it becomes too formulaic and predictable for its own good.  Instead of feeling lived in and exciting, most of the obvious `tricks' feel stagy and fake.  Swank proves that she cannot perform effectively without a gimmick, delivering a forgettable performance.  Pacino reigns in his usual theatrics, but he is less convincing than he needed to be.  Robin Williams gets under the skin with ease, and he festers.  He truly is the best thing about this film and definitely proves that he has more talent than many want to admit (he pigeonholes himself).<br /><br />I love Nolan (not as much as some, but far more than others).  He has a gift of imagery and he can capture moods with ease.  He does some good atmospheric work here (capturing unease in bright sunlight is hard to do), but at the end of the day, `Insomnia' is a little too mundane to make the desired impact.  It actually becomes tiresome and a tad boring.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Like the 1997 Norwegian film on which it is based, "Insomnia" is a superbly crafted crime thriller, one that is more concerned with the psychological complexities of its main character than with the minutiae of the criminal investigation itself - though the details of the case are fascinating in their own right as well.<p>Al Pacino delivers his finest performance in years in the role of Detective Will Dormer, a seasoned homicide investigator brought in from Los Angeles to help solve the murder of a seventeen-year-old high school student in rural Alaska.  The problem is that, back in L.A., Dormer is facing some heat of his own from LAPD's Internal Affairs Division, which is beginning a probe into the propriety of some of the veteran's actions on the job.  Back in Alaska, while on a stakeout to nab the possible killer, Dormer becomes disoriented in the fog and ends up accidentally shooting and killing his longtime partner, a colleague who, Dormer had just learned, was planning to cooperate with the IA investigation back home, thereby bringing about the possible ruination of Dormer's career and reputation.  Caught off guard by this sudden turn of events, Dormer suddenly finds himself in the unfamiliar role of perpetrator, looking for ways to cover up a "crime" rather than unravel it.  One of the compelling themes of the film is its insistence that only a very thin line separates those who commit crimes from those whose job it is to uncover and prosecute the wrongdoers.<p>Dormer is stunned to find how quickly and easily he can cross over that line.  The outstanding screenplay by Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjaerg really knows how to get into the minds and emotions of its characters, particularly in the case of Dormer, who turns out to be one of the most psychologically complex and fascinating figures we have encountered in the movies in a long, long time.  Here is a man who has built his name and career on knowing how to unravel complex crimes, always priding himself on being one step ahead of the criminals who are so convinced they have left no traces behind which could point to their guilt.  Yet, now Dormer finds himself in the same boat, as he anxiously looks for ways to hide the fact that he shot - even accidentally - a man who had the power to bring him down.  As the story develops, Dormer, whom we assume at the start is innocent of the charges for which he is being investigated by Internal Affairs, begins to seem less and less innocent and more and more capable of doing just exactly what it is he is being accused of.  Yet, the triumph of the film is that Pacino and the screenwriters never let us feel we know all there is to know about Dormer.  He is truly a man of mystery, so tightly coiled that even he doesn't know or understand all that is going on in the deepest, darkest recesses of his psyche.  By setting the film in the summer near the Arctic Circle, the filmmakers are able to provide a natural phenomenon to help aggravate Dormer's potentially psychotic condition.  Like Mersault in Camus' "The Stranger," Dormer becomes strangely disoriented by the oppressive effect of the sun, though, in this case, it is the lack of a night that drives Dormer crazy through insomnia.  As the virtually indistinguishable days and nights pass without sleep, Dormer begins to suffer from delirium and hallucinations, making it all the harder for him to separate truth from fiction, fantasy from reality and - most importantly - right from wrong and morality from immortality.  When the killer reveals to Dormer that he saw him shoot his partner, Dormer finds himself faced with the ethical crisis of turning the culprit in or of bonding with him as "partners" in mutual criminality and guilt.  Here again the once-clear and distinct line between investigator and criminal suddenly ceases to exist.<p>Pacino, stoop-shouldered and craggy-faced - the prominent bags under his eyes a physical testimony to his weariness and sleeplessness - plumbs the very depths of this infinitely rich and complex character.  In fact, there is nothing less than an outstanding performance in the entire film.  Robin Williams brings an air of restraint and understatement to the part of Walter Finch, the killer who plays a cat-and-mouse mind game with the sleepless, intellectually vulnerable Dormer, exploiting Dormer's weakened state to his own advantage.  Hilary Swank brings a warmth and compassion to her role as Ellie Burr, an eager-to-please detective who has long idolized Dormer and his work, who also has to make an emotionally wrenching choice near the end of the film.  Finally, Maura Tierney makes her few scenes count as a sympathetic innkeeper whom Dormer turns to as the person who happens to be handy at the moment when the need to unburden his soul spontaneously arises within him.  <p>As the film's director, Christopher Nolan establishes and maintains a mood of quiet intensity throughout the course of the film.  Helped by the stark, but somewhat oppressively gloomy beauty of the Alaskan outpost setting, Nolan makes us experience the same sense of unease and disorientation Dormer himself feels.  Nolan has chosen to punctuate his film with a series of highly charged, intensely dramatic confrontation scenes between Dorman and any number of the other characters in the film.  The film never wanes in interest for even a moment of its running time.<p>It is an enormous pleasure to see a film as intelligently conceived and executed as "Insomnia."  Kudos to everyone involved with making this such a rare and fascinating movie going experience.  But the greatest thanks goes to Al Pacino himself.  He has never been so good.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KG8WLR1AKO12.html">A2KG8WLR1AKO12</a><br/><p>Chris Nolan deserved an academy award nomination for his previous direction of Momento. He probably was denied such an honor merely because that great film did not receive the backing of a large studio. Insomnia is clearly one of the best films that you will likely see this year. It is breathtakingly beautiful to look at. One will envy the Alaskans who are so fortunate to be surrounded by such awe inspiring scenery. Insomnia would be well worth seeing just for that fact alone. However, it offers substantially more than mere attractiveness. The acting of Al Pacino and Robin Williams is stupendous. Williams abandons his standard nice guy roles to portray a character of low self esteem who will stop at virtually nothing to escape justice. Both men will probably be remembered during Oscar time. Hillary Swank is also very good in her role as the idealistic young detective Ellie Burr who worships the ground that older homicide investigator Will Dormer (Pacino) walks on.<p>The story revolves around the murder of a seventeen year old girl. Detective Dormer is called in from Los Angeles to assist the local police in finding the killer. He is accompanied by partner Hap Eckert (Martin Donovan) who is about to turn state's evidence against him. Dormer planted evidence on a man suspected of torturing and murdering a young boy. The veteran detective knows his life is about to be ruined. He then accidentally shoots and kills Hap. This is where the film takes off as we witness Dormer's personality and moral disintegration. We learn early on that a mildly popular crime novelist named Walter Finch (Williams) has murdered the girl. The plot twists and turns while Dormer suffering from a severe lack of sleep hunts down Finch---and finds himself in the untenable checkmated predicament where he is unable to arrest the manipulating Finch. Insomnia builds upon the eternally reoccurring tragic themes of sin and redemption. Can Dormer still do the right thing, or has his past compromises with wrong doing incapacitated his moral compass? Try imagining Crime and Punishment and Macbeth in an Alaskan rural setting.<p>Insomnia easily earns five stars and proves that Chris Nolan is one of our greatest living directors. You should see this film as quickly as possible. Don't walk, but run to the theater. Let the kids view the escapist movies currently being released. Insomnia is a film for us adults.</p></br><a href="../users/AHBNPMHDWZ7SB.html">AHBNPMHDWZ7SB</a><br/><p>Insomnia is a bit different from what Christopher Nolan is known for, but it's still another fantastic notch on his belt. I stated in my review of The Prestige that, that movie was possibly his weakest, and I felt that way until revisiting this film. I think Insomnia is his weakest entry overall, but it was still a fantastic thriller. Calling any of Nolan's film weaker than their counterparts doesn't quite mean the same as it would for many other filmmakers, because I like all of his films that I've seen. First of all, the pacing is surprisingly well done. His films tend to run two hours plus, but this one was just under two hours. That was great because it had a quicker pace that captured the feeling of trying to solve a murder case in the first few days (any First 48 fans out there?). This movie was a remake apparently, I wasn't aware of that until doing some research. It's a remake of a 1997 Erik Skjoldbj?rg movie by the same name. I cannot judge whether or not it does the original justice, but I can say that it is worth a watch.<br /><br />Al Pacino did a great, if not subdued, job as a conflicted veteran LAPD officer who recently came under scrutiny for some questionable acts he and his partner committed while on the job. What's new, it's the LAPD? Opposite of Pacino was Robin Williams as a creepy local novelist, and my was he great. Between this and One Hour Photo, I've seen a sinister side of Williams that I'd love to see more, and more of in the future. Hilary Swank rounds out the leads as an unexperienced, and eager, local officer assisting Pacino's character, Dormer, on this investigation. She's always reliable, and hardly ever outshines her co-stars. Same goes for her in this film. Aside from the effective leads, another aid to this film in setting the tone of a classic suspense novel or film was the snowy, cold, lonely Alaskan setting. Alaska, when used correctly, can be an amazingly chilling (no pun intended) setting for any bleak, mysterious, etc story. Insomnia is not as dark as what one would have grown accustomed to by Nolan's standards (literally because the sun never sets in Alaska), but because of the somber tone, it's still a dark story.<br /><br />The story is also pretty complex. It's not difficult to follow by any means, but the way that events unfold increasingly complicate things for our lead character, until that faithful day in all suspense thrillers where things come to a head and then pop, like a figurative pimple. It was really interesting to see Pacino's character progress through one distressing situation after another, all while battling his own demons from his past. Again though, the actors are what really drive this thriller home. Not to beat a dead horse, but Robin Williams is quite disturbing, and Hilary Swank also did quite well. The music did not stand out as much as the scores in Nolan's films usually do. This was before Nolan and Zimmer hooked up, so that's understandable. Overall, I liked it a lot. It hasn't become a classic in its genre, but it's still a great crime story and case study. It's smartly crafted, and definitely worth everyone's time.</p></br><a href="../users/A267IXCC7UK1HY.html">A267IXCC7UK1HY</a><br/><p>This is a taut, clever thriller where the detective plays cat and mouse with the criminal and vice versa. I would give it five stars but for the photography: a number of the scenes are shot with the camera unsteady--something that irritates me no end--and the narrative is occasionally interrupted with one-second totally blurry representations of the crime. (This is so gratuitous and irritating I am tempted to penalize it to THREE stars.)</p></br><a href="../users/AVT9Q9PTUCDMR.html">AVT9Q9PTUCDMR</a><br/><p>I love Christopher Nolan and the filmmaking is first-rate even in this more formulaic type of movie. Basically, it's a thriller but the setting in Alaska in the always daylight summertime there makes the movie what it is.<br /><br />Now I'm not a big fan at all of Hillary Swank (sorry, those gigantic teeth and her being Steve Sanders' annoying girlfriend at one point on "Beverley Hills, 90210" just can never be erased from my brain) or Robin Williams on the big screen but I at least found them tolerable and believable in this. Meaning they must be good actors for me to overcome my completely prejudiced views of their whole body of work.<br /><br />Anyway, in no way shape or form is this anywhere near as great as Inception, Memento or Following which both contain the same sort of themes of playing with time and people's perceptions of time as well as using the location as really a major part of the film. Throw in the whole Nolan obsession with the human mind and that's where Insomnia is at. Problem is it's at its base level this is still a murder mystery of which way too much gets revealed at the start when Al Pacino shoots his fellow cop accidentally on purpose early in the movie. Don't worry it's not a spoiler as the audience sees and knows this on screen very early in the flick.<br /><br />I would say it is worth watching but I think it suffers mainly in comparison to Nolan's other majestically brilliant work. Taken on its own, it's a decent almost film noir in some ways and well worth seeing even if it doesn't stack up to Nolan's other films.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VJ80PM1G00QV.html">A2VJ80PM1G00QV</a><br/><p>I should say that the fact that the sun doesn't set for months becomes a major theme in the film, coupled with the question of just what is the behavior that a good cop will expect of him-or herself. Al Pacino gives a bravura performance as the cop who suffers from insomnia due to the sun and whose actions in the past and present lead him to question his self-conception as a good cop. He is ably abetted by Swank and Williams, with the supporting roles being filled well. There is some action, some talk, some scenery, and no sleep. All in all, an above average effort to portray The Detective and The Criminal. Good watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>Three very good character actors come together in a crime drama/<br />mystery in the long summer day of Alaska.<br />A shooting during a chase results in a detective's death.<br />The murder, then, saw the detective kill his partner<br />and when the detective finds him, he blackmails the detective<br />who has been finding it very hard to sleep.<br />Get some sleep... it is a nightmare in Nightmute<br />for the detectives!</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>Insomnia is a good thriller thats worth buying for many reasons:<br /><br />Its a top notch cast.

Robin Williams matches Pacino in his second great role that year (see One Hour Photo for the other), and the always good Hilary Swank gives a very good performance supporting the two main leads.<br /><br />The director is Christopher Nolan (Memento, Batman Begins, The Prestige), who seems to have a natural talent for these type of films. He does a fine job with the actors as well as capturing the sometimes haunting nature of the Alaskan landscape. Nolan is helped by a taught script, and with a running time of less than 2 hours, you will find it difficult to sleep through.<br /><br />I haven't seen the original 1997 version of this film. From what I've heard its the better of the two, which means it must be very good.

Robin Williams isn't as convincing as the bad guy in this movie and the movie could have been a tad less predictable in the ending, but otherwise a good movie overall.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>2002's "Insomnia" is one of the most quietly melancholy American movies I've ever seen--all the characters (with the exception of Hillary Swank's annoyingly idealistic female detective Ellie Burr) are somehow grimy and have something to hide.<br /><br />Robin Williams plays a really good creep.  "One Hour Photo" was a movie with a lot of potential that ultimately went nowhere, but he sure makes up for it here as the effeminate failed writer and murderer of a 17 year old girl. Williams successfully underplays the role of a neurotic psychopath (Walter Finch) whose pathos we see emerge in the smallest and most pivotal moments, thereby making them even more disturbing.<br /><br />The cinematography is damn near perfect--the Alaskan wilderness is a perfect backdrop for Det Will Dormer's (Al Pacino) psychological meltdown and inability to sleep.  The time zone and his entire life is closing in on him slowly: a previous investigation in which he planted evidence to convict another child killer is beginning to catch up with him.  On top of this, his younger partner (Martin Donovan) is forced to make a deal with internal affairs about the matter.  As if things could get worse, he accidentally shoots and kills him in a foggy gun battle where Finch is lurking.<br /><br />He is then forced to sink so low as to collaborate with Finch himself, who orchestrated the incident precisely for control of not only his fate but Dormer's.  The whole theme of dishonesty, even in the service of a just cause, gracefully winds around Dormer's neck like a noose.  The ending is as devastating as the entire film, with Swank's character given  the hope of redemption out of all this corruption.

The main problem is the relentless softening and sentimentalising of the material: Pacino's cop is much more sociable and wise rather than the Skaarsgard's morally empty cold fish, and is consequently much less interesting. Nolan keeps Pacino's shouty moments to a minimum and he does a much more impressive job of the sleep deprivation, but the audience-friendly characterization results in a clich?d stereotype on a predictable journey to inevitable redemption.<br /><br />Sadly, the dilution doesn't end with Pacino but runs throughout the film. In this version - for those familiar with the original - the dog is already dead to avoid anything that might alienate us from the hero, the women are mostly father confessor figures, the hotel receptionist IS polite to the shot man, there's no kitten scene, Hilary Swank is saddled with a horrible "I know you're a good cop even if you don't" scene that lacks the cold condemnation and loss of trust of the original's finale and, most damagingly, it's strongly implied that the girl's murder was not accidental, which draws a line between cop and killer. A couple of key scenes are badly directed, most notably the shooting in the fog that highlights Nolan's problems with action scenes (although there is one good chase over logs in the river).<br /><br />There are, however, strong points, mostly once Robin Williams enters the scene. The film does briefly address the complicity between cop and killer and takes interesting detours from the original, but it's still a film that works for a couple of reels at a time then goes off the boil for another couple of reels before staging another recovery.</p></br><a href="../users/AUSATFDSU2INS.html">AUSATFDSU2INS</a><br/><p>In Halibut, Alaska, the Sun doesn't' come down at nights.

The somber tone of the characters is reflected masterfully with the portrayals of Williams and Pacino.<br /><br />Insomnia lets us see that not everything in life is black and white. Our experiences, generally, are a mix of grays. It also explores the reasons and motives of villains, and the vulnerabilities of heroes.<br /><br />At some point, inspector Dormer defines his position when affirms that "his job is to assign guilt". To decide whether he should do it by taking a look to the exterior world or to him is the most critic crossroad of this wonderful film.</p></br><a href="../users/ALWB64XOXNMDP.html">ALWB64XOXNMDP</a><br/><p>I never expected Robin Williams to be so good as the villian in this picture.  In this one we see early on that he plays a cat and mouse game with Pacino.  Pacino's character accedently kills his partner while he's chasing Williams.  He knows this and never lets him forget it thoughout the movie.  All in all it's a movie you can watch again because the characers in it are so interesting.  So if you bought this one in the budget bin like I did you won't be sorry for the money you spent for it.  There is lots of good dialogue and character bits here.  For Hitchcock fans (who remember him) ...it is in the tradition of his films because you don't know what to expect.</p></br><a href="../users/AB2AQMK9PCWWX.html">AB2AQMK9PCWWX</a><br/><p>I dig Pacino. I am fanatic about Robin. But, I didn't even try to get the sleep Pacino wanted so dearly and was granted it while viewing this cine. Why? My problem: they should have given the uncredited role thing to Robin, which at least had given the movie more punch when you find out who's the killer. A la Spacey in Se7en. The mystery was supposed to drive the story more. How's the mystery gonna drive the story when you tell everyone who did it from the bat? Granted, the Midnight Sun and lack of sleep angle adds something to the drama, but seeing a sleepy, craggy, crabby Pacino go thru his contorsions made me a bit more drowsy than my fellow reviewers...</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>Allthough a lot of people avoided this film in the movie theaters (myself included) because of the rather dodgy choice of the casting Robin Williams as a killer, it appears that these fears were totally unjustified.<br />  Insomnia is a film that contributes nicely to a genre desperate gor oxygen, that of the old and classic "dtetective film".<br />  It works because it incorporates several interesting angles to keep you interested throughout as well as guessing.<br />  An Alaskan town as the setting for a murder case where an L.A detective is brought in? Nice touch.<br />  A killer not played by the usual baddies but by "Ms Doubtfire"-Robin Williams? Better touch even.<br />  A detective who cant seem to get any sleep under the never setting sun in Alaska even if his life depended on it? Good, really good.<br />  It's mainly those 3 axes that fuel the engine of this story and, of course, the superb acting of Pacino and even Williams who settles in his killer role incredibly convincingly. It wouldnt matter, in fact, how Pacino came across here had Williams not fit in with his role. The whole thing would've collapsed in ruins. <p>  But that's exactly it, Williams plays the loser-small-time-author-turned-killer perfectly and from there on it's a smooth ride all the way to the end.<br />  This is a film by dierctor Chritopher Nolan who filmed Memento and if u thought that Memento avoided any cliches so does Insomnia. Insomnia HAD to avoid the cliches because ths is genre that has gone stale exactly because it rode the cliches for far too long.<br />  Pacino's character is one that grows edgier every 5 minutes the film progresses no doubt NOT helped by his lack of sleep. He's also a character that has a lot on the line as he's been sent to Alaska because of internal tension in his department and because he's got a great reputation to protect.<br />  That reputation takes a huge dent as he winds up killing his partner in the case (by mistake? not? not sure) and this becomes the killer's leverage point in a way that provides for numerous twists.<br />  Williams's character is one that has become a murderer "because it happened" and he seems to have great adjustability potentials as he slips into his role like a snake would around its victim. Being the cornered animal since it's not going to be easy to remain unknown for long in the small Alaskan town environs he decides to turn this into a poker affair with the cop. As Pacino seems to either overtrust or simoultaneously underestimate his opponent the twists become weirder and better.<br /><br />  Much to the director's credit there's no clear-cut happy end.Had there been it would a classic case of the film that does well or great until the last 30 seconds when it all turns silly. Not the case here, the end is tense, believable, plausible and has the showdown touch the whole story has been yearning for.<br />  Refreshing and excellently filmed it reminded me how much i've missed good detective story-films.</p></br><a href="../users/A391YPR0NFTCLK.html">A391YPR0NFTCLK</a><br/><p>This is a great movie!

A young police woman, played by Hilary Swank, is an admirer of his and she is thrilled to be working on a case with him.  An incident occurs during the investigation which turns everything upside down and threatens Pacino's career.  He forms an unholy alliance with a character played by Robin Williams and the rest of the movie is all about self-preservation and trying to be the last man standing.  Throughout the movie Pacino fights insomnia in the land of the Midnight Sun where darkness never falls.  The scenery in the movie is spectacular and the acting is very good.  This is recommended viewing for those who enjoy action/thrillers.</p></br><a href="../users/A3K5IMGDCDBCNF.html">A3K5IMGDCDBCNF</a><br/><p>Let's just get this out of the way, Insomnia is not as good as Memento. I mention this simply because most of my conversations about this film have started like this: "What did you think of Insomnia?" And the answer would go something like, "It was good, but not as good as Memento." Well I don't think that is fair to this film, the performers, or, in particular, Christopher Nolan. Memento is an exceptional film, if not a great film. If Nolan had tried to plug his Memento formula into his next project we would have got another Jackie Brown, I prefer Insomnia. So what do I think? Insomnia is a studio film (a good one at that), a step in the right direction, and it has Al Pacino (The MAN). <p>Disclaimer: Please read someone else's review for a plot summary. I'm not going to spoil, but I just want to talk about why I like it. So, why I like it. Well first, and most certainly foremost, this is first rate filmmaking. Christopher Nolan is a star. Momento was brilliant on several levels, but it was a gimic picture to a certain extent (see it if you haven't). By this rational it is also an innovative film, but that separates it from Insomnia, they shouldn't be compared. However Nolan puts his stamp on Insomnia, much like he did Momento, i.e. Nolan is a unique talant, not a pan in the wash. His pacing is masterful, his visual style is purposeful and consistent, his story is engaging, and he has Al Pacino.<p>Al Pacino. He hasn't been on the screen since Any Given Movie and it was well worth the wait. This DVD has a unique feature on the commentary track. The commentary follows the shooting schedule instead of the narrative. This allows the audience to see how Pacino works. It is a great special feature, as good as any I've seen. It goes without saying that Pacino is an amazing actor, but to be able to see how he evolves and molds his character is such a gift. Watch how the camera envades his personal space, watch how Pacino embraces it. I thought he was excellent in this film. The other heavies are good, but this is Pacino's movie. He carries it.<p>One last thing, the daylight in this film. Nolan has made a dark film in constant light. Inspired.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>The fascinating psychological thriller "Insomnia" is a remake of an excellent Norwegian movie released about five years ago. In large part, it succeeds in improving upon the original because it fleshes out the relationship between the main character and the killer he is pursuing.<p>Detective Will Dormer [Al Pacino] and his partner are dispatched to the far reaches of Alaska to help investigate the grisly murder of a young woman. Internal Affairs has them under investigation back in Los Angeles, and their trip seems to be part of a plan to get them out of the way for awhile. With the help of local detective Ellie Burr [Hilary Swank], the investigation starts out well, but soon Dormer is plagued by insomnia triggered by the lack of darkness during the Alaskan summer. After a couple of days, fatigue sets in, and he begins to falter. The situation gets much worse after a dreadful accident occurs during a stakeout. It isn't long before the killer [Robin Williams] begins to play a deadly cat and mouse game with him. [Note: Saying who plays the killer gives almost nothing of the plot away.]<p>The cast is uniformly excellent. Director Christopher Nolan, whose last film was the highly original thriller "Memento", again takes on the tricky concept of time. In this case, Dormer's insomnia causes him to lose track of time in a palce where there is no night. In the process, he also loses track of himself. <p>"Insomnia"s main theme is moral ambiguity, and Dormer's not knowing whether it's day or night serves to underscores that theme. [Everything is relative.] This is a sophisticated thriller for adults. Its few action scenes seem almost beside the point, as if they were placed there as an afterthought to make the movie more appealing to mainstream audiences.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>Much as I enjoyed Chris Nolan's "Following" and "Memento", he really pulls out all the stops with this third film. I saw the foreign film upon which this was based and, unusually, this is the better film.  (Usually American remakes of foreign films are total schlock but that is not true here.)  It has some key ingredients for achieving this though.  First off, a first rate script that no one has "Hollywoodized." Secondly, letting Al Pacino and Robin Williams loose with their talents on first rate material and, in Williams' case, against his usual type, was sheer genius.  The two are absolutely superb together.  Pacino is the anti-hero cop who investigates a murder case in Alaska while trying to cope with a partner (Martin Donovan) who is going to turn state's evidence against him when they return to LA.  Not only will this ruin his career but it might also release all the murderers Pacino's character put away in prison. The partners are trying to track down the villain, Williams.  Surprisingly though, instead of running, Williams' villain comes forward and plays with Pacino's character, preying upon his weaknesses.  Pacino is further handicapped by not being able to get any sleep because of a variety of factors but not the least of which is that he's not used to sunlight 24/7 which occurs in Alaska in the warmer weather.  Martin Donovan and Hillary Swank do very good work as the other detectives but it is hard to compare them against the sheer star power and magnetism of Pacino and Williams together. The murder case is actually not as important as the unravelling of these two men's characters.  Buy it. I did and it's not going anywhere!</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>When I first heard of the great Chris Nolan directing a film about a serial killer starring Al Pacino and Robin Williams I was ecstatic.  Well, I just got back from seeing Insomnia, and it is one of the better films I have seen in the past year.  Al Pacino plays an L.A. detective called into a case in Alaska involving a dead teenage girl.  When Pacino arrives he finds a web of secrets, all leading to Robin Williams (cast surprisingly perfect as the killer), who learns that Pacino himself has some secrets.  Hillary Swank is great as well in her role as a rookie cop, proving her Oscar win wasn't a fluke.  The atmosphere of the film, especially between Pacino and Williams (the scene where they meet face to face) is what makes Insomnia a winner, and Nolan doesn't compromise his directorial skills and keeps Insomnia an unorthodox game of cat & mouse.  The cinematography is worth noting as well, and should be remembered when Oscar time rolls around.  George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh also helped produce the film, and I recommend seeing Insomnia as soon as you can.  I haven't seen a movie that will haunt you like this in quite some time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>"Insomnia" is an at times confusing puzzle by the same person who created the cult hit\ and perhaps even classic(?) film "Memento", Christopher Nolan.<br /> "Insomnia" is a remake of an 1998 Norwegian film directed by Erik Skjoldbjaerg, and it's one of the few times we can say a remake actually works! This new version of "Insomnia" is so grandly conceieved, so richly constructed that I'm afraid American audiences won't like it. "Insomnia" is not some by the numbers, fast-paced, loud summer movie, that perhaps some people might think it will turn out to be, no, this movie is a well thought out character study about what happens when we make the wrong choices to protect ourselves. Director, Nolan is more concerned here with the story and character development then loud car chasing scenes, or big explosions. Nolan and screenwriter Hillary Seitz have actually taken the time out to tell us a story. They pace the film wonderfully and allow us to get to know the characters. There is more to a film like "Insomnia" than meets the eye. But, even so, like I said, I'm afraid the American public won't go for it. The American public likes fast, cliche, pointless, mindless movies. They like to see people run away from dinosaurs or people under attack by a group of aliens. I know for a fact people will say that this movie is slow and boring. And that it doesn't go anywhere. People will say this film is not a good follow-up to "Memento". But, they are wrong. They just have no patience.<br /> The plot for "Insomnia" goes something like this; Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are two L.A. cops sent to Alaska to investigate the murder of a teenage girl. Once they arrive they are greeted by Ellie Burr (Hillary Swank) who is a by the books, young cop. She's the cliche character who became a cop because she loves it. She thinks that there's no corruption inside the system. As the film goes on, we find out that it's not merely because Dormer (Pacino) and Eckhart (Donovan) are good cops that they have been sent to investigate this case. They were both in trouble in L.A. for some questionable actions on their last case. This is there way of taking the "heat" off them. As the film goes on we find out that the killer was\is a "twisted" person. He actually took the time out to wash the girl's hair, to paint her nails, and even clip them! It was not just a random act of violence, but a premeditated one. I don't really want to give much more information then I already have, you just have to go see the film yourself to find out the rest. All I will say is the film has a lot of "tricks" up it's sleeve, so don't think you'll be able to see through the plot.<br /> So, some of you are probably wondering, how is this different from the original, well, there are small differences. Like the whole background story with the lead character's being sent on the case. The relationship between the two cops is different. And, the female character in this one doesn't seem as strong. Also, there are some brief scenes of sexual content. Which does not appear in this new version.<br /> "Insomnia" is one of the year's best films, it has a truly remarkable performance by Al Pacino. So far, it's the best performance of the year! Pacino proves himself to be one of the greatest actor we have around today. Robin Williams is oddly, very good in this film. I use the word oddly because I sometimes find it hard for me to see him in serious roles. I mean, this is the same man who use to play a space alien on "Mork & Mindy". But, Williams gives his best performance since "Good Will Hunting". Hilary Swank gives a good performance as well, but, for me, it wasn't anything really special, though, I don't think that was her fault, I think it was just the way the part was written.<br /> Bottom-Line: "Insomnia" is an extremely well constructed character study\thriller. The pacing of the film is wonderful and the performances are even better. Truly one of the year's best films!</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>Al Pacino stars as Dormer, an LA detective on assignment in remote Alaska.  He is there to help a local cop (Hilary Swank) find the killer of a teenage girl.  Dormer sufers from insomnia, due to the ever-present sunlight in the Alaskan summer; his nerves are frayed, he's strung-out, and he makes a big mistake.  He accidently kills a police officer, and blames the murderer.  That story would probably work except for one thing:  the girl's killer saw him do it.<br /><br />Pacino is outstanding as the morally conflicted cop who can't sleep.  Swank is good as the eager-beaver young cop who must deal with her own issues of right and wrong.  The weak link in the cast is Robin Williams, who plays the murderer, Finch.  We know he can be genuinely creepy, as he was in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007976T">One Hour Photo</a>.  It's too bad he didn't bring some of that spine-tingling excitement to this role.  He is much too low-key, comfortable, and cheerful.  The movie lacks suspense of any kind, due to Williams' nice-guy bad-guy.  Fans of Al Pacino will enjoy his profoundly moving performance, but those hoping for edge-of-your-seat suspense will be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CWH6VKCTJAD.html">A3CWH6VKCTJAD</a><br/><p>Director Christopher Nolan made a sensational splash with the indie hit &quot;Memento&quot;, earning him this shot at the big time.  For the most part, he proved himself up to the task.  &quot;Insomnia&quot; provides a multilayered psychological thriller where two distinct storylines are interwoven in the character of Will Dormer (Al Pacino).<p>The workup is a bit contrived, with Dormer coming to Alaska from LA to help out an old buddy with a murder investigation as he is himself being investigated by internal affairs.  This serves as a foundation for the two storylines.  The first is the animosity that develops between Dormer and his partner, who wants to cut a deal with internal affairs.  The second, of course, is the murder investigation.  After Dormer accidentally (?) shoots his partner while chasing the suspect in dense fog, the psychological games begin.  Local detective Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), who is fawning all over Dormer and has read all his books on detective work, begins to suspect that her hero may have feet of clay.<p>The psychodrama becomes intense as Dormer is confronted with communications from his killer nemesis Walter Finch (Robin Williams), while suspicions swirl around the death of his partner.  Add to this his inability to get any sleep in Alaska's perpetual daylight and you have a man driven to the absolute brink.<p>Nolan does an excellent job of shooting this film and the editing intensifies the psychological tension.  The cinematography is also superb, aided by the majesctic Alaskan and British Columbian locations.  While the interaction between Dormer and Finch is unlikely, the symbiotic relationship that develops is fascinating and Nolan squeezes every psychological tingle that can be wrung from it.<p>Pacino is masterful as the insomniac cop who has made certain ethical compromises in his career in the name of justice.  He looks so terrible that he must have been purposely depriving himself of sleep to increase the realism of the character.  Pacino gives Dormer (an interesting play on the latin dormire, &quot;to sleep&quot;, a dormer is the window of a sleeping room) a hard edge that gradually erodes as he becomes more sleep deprived, blurring the distinction between good and evil.<p>Robin Williams seems to be trying to shed his nice guy image with back to back wackos.  He follows up his sociopathic performance in &quot;1 Hour Photo&quot; with this character who is a sort of sinister pragmatist.  Williams is at his best when he is pushing sanity's limits, whether that be in zany comedy or maniacal mayhem, which is precisely why he was wrong for this part.  This character is far too calculating and controlled for Williams talents and the part was also much too physical for him.  He is just not convincing as a cold blooded killer and tough guy.  That is not to say it was a bad performance, just the wrong actor.  Hilary Swank unfortunately doesn't have much to do in a film that is dominated by Pacino and Williams.<p>This is an excellent big budget debut for Nolan and another terrific performance by Pacino.  The suspense and pace are first rate and despite the contrivances, it delivers.  I rated it an 8/10.  Definitely not a snoozer.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>INSOMNIA is a fantastic thriller, full of twists, turns, and arctic-cold atmosphere. Al Pacino (The Godfather 1 and 2, Scarface, Heat, etc.) is LA homicide detective Will Dormer, sent to Nightmute, Alaska to investigate a murder. Will has a lot of professional / personal baggage that complicates matters, causing him to hide his own secrets while trying to solve the crime. Add to this the fact that he's arrived in northern Alaska during it's season of perpetual daylight, and he's got major sleeping problems as well! Between the murder case, the eternal daylight, and Will's own conscience, he quickly becomes a mess! It's amazing that he can still function at all, let alone, well. Hilary Swank (The Gift, 11:14) is a young officer who assists Dormer, only to find her own loyalties and sense of justice challenged. Robin Williams (One Hour Photo, The Night Listener) plays a seemingly mild-mannered sociopath whose one frantic desire is to cover / save his own a$$! INSOMNIA succeeds at building tension while showing Will Dormer's mental disintegration. A classic crime drama w/ something extra. Loaded w/ memorable scenes like the chase-in-the-fog, chase-across-the-floating-logs, and invisible-oncoming-truck sequences, INSOMNIA holds up well after many repeat viewings. Highly recommended...  P.S.- Watch for both Katherine Isabelle and Emily Perkins from the GINGER SNAPS movies, as the victim's best friend and the eulogizer at her funeral respectively...</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZCA4LTTVGAD.html">A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</a><br/><p>In "Insomnia," directed by Christopher Nolan, Al Pacino plays Will Dormer, a Los Angeles police detective. While a controversy swirls around him and his partner, Dormer travels to a small town in Alaska to help with a murder investigation. This assignment leads him into a tension-filled cat-and-mouse game with creepy mystery writer Walter Finch (played by Robin Williams). As an added twist, the story takes place during the Alaskan summer, when there is endless daylight; amidst this inescapable light, Dormer suffers from the malady of the film's title.<p>"Insomnia" is a gripping, stylishly made film. The gritty action sequences have a low-tech realism that is a welcome change from the typically overdone Hollywood action thing. The performances are outstanding. Williams gets a lot of mileage out of his effectively low-key interpretation of Finch. Veteran character actor Paul Dooley brings warmth and subtle authority to his role as a small town cop, and Hilary Swank is a superb foil for Pacino in her role as an eager young cop. Pacino is excellent as the film's flawed protagonist. His performance is truly harrowing.<p>"Insomnia" succeeds as a suspense drama. The motif of endless daylight is well used throughout the film, and is weighted with potential symbolic meaning. More than just a good thriller, "Insomnia" also raises some relevant moral and ethical issues.</p></br><a href="../users/AOPQ0KA1B7BFD.html">AOPQ0KA1B7BFD</a><br/><p>Update:  Not sure why my review has been moved to the movie Insomnia, but the review I wrote below is for a Quad Pack DVD package that includes Insomnia, Heat, The Devil's Advocate, and Seven. Unless you are considering a purchase of the Quad package, the review below will not be much help because it deals with the transfer quality of the movies, not the movies themselves.<br /><br />Okay, you probably know the movies, so no need to review them.  Chances are you have interest in one or more of the movies but aren't quite sure whether to pull the trigger due to the Quad Pack packaging.  I wanted The Devil's Advocate plus Heat and it was less expensive to get them packaged like this than separately.  I was just suspicious of what kind of quality transfer I'd get, but what the heck, I took the risk and ordered it.<br /><br />As soon as I get a blu-ray or DVD movie I pop it my HD system to see the quality of the transfer.  Then I rate it from 1 to 5, 1 being perfect, 2 digital sharp, 3 marginal, 4 poor, and 5 unwatchable.  I'm always suspicious of Double-Triple-Quad movie packs because the quality of the transfer to DVD is generally a lower quality.  That isn't the case with this quad pack.  Granted, my rating scale is subjective but I have a discerning eye.  All four movies in this pack rated as a 2 for digital sharp.  One of the DVD movies, Seven, even came with the DTS sound option.  The other 3 were Dolby 5.1.<br /><br />There are two double sided DVDs in the quad pack, a movie on each side.  The only criticism of the discs is you have to have a magnifying glass to read the center rim label to see which movie you're popping in the player.  Thankfully each movie is just as nice as a single disc, keepcase DVD.<br /><br />Overall, this DVD quad pack is definitely worth the price.</p></br><a href="../users/AWPODHOB4GFWL.html">AWPODHOB4GFWL</a><br/><p>Director Christopher Nolan hit artistic and cinematic paydirt with his underappreciated, &quot;Memento&quot;.

Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hilary Swank, and Nicky Katt are all great actors. The problem is, the story just doesn't seem compelling enough on it's own. The actors are the only thing sustaining interest. It's also riddled with bad-tv cliches: Evidence is found by accident, days after dozens of people turned the beach upside-down and found nothing, the killer opens a drawer in his house, allowing a cop to see evidence that can implicate him (oops!), Pacino even gets the location of Williams' hideout from the jacket of a book he'd written! Come ON.....sloppy writing!<p>  The film is worth seeing, if you're a fan of any of these actors. Otherwise, try the original. You won't regret it.</p></br><a href="../users/A27PSZX2SE0B51.html">A27PSZX2SE0B51</a><br/><p>There's a sequence about half way through "Insomnia", where rumpled L.A. cop Will Dormer chases a man he believes to be the murderer he's come to Alaska to find, across a log drive.  It's a thrilling moment, especially when Dormer trips into the water and finds himself trapped beneath the logs.  By about halfway through the scene, I realized a startling thing: I was watching 62-year old Al Pacino and 50-year old Robin Williams acting out a footrace.  And it was enthralling.  In hindsight, I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised, for "Insomnia" lives to confound its audience's expectations.<p>That's a strange statement to make considering it's a remake.  But when the original happens to be a 5-year old Norwegian film, one that I've beaten my brains out trying to find in local video stores for years, it makes much more sense.  And when you realize that Christopher Nolan, the auteur-mastermind behind 2000's "Memento", you come to expect the unexpected.<p>Nolan tackles a much more conventional thriller this time out.  "Conventional" being a relative terms, for "Insomnia" is anything but.  Sure, all the typical elements are there, but it's less focused on bringing those elements together, or on working through the machinations of the plot.  Rather, it spends its time thoroughly dissecting the psychologies of its characters.<p>In the end, "Insomnia" is really about one thing: the slow disintegration of one good cop.  Will Dormer (= dormir = to sleep; yeah, yeah, we get it) is Serpico 20 years down the line: a legend in his own mind and the mind of others.  But his reputation has been severely damaged even before he gets to Nightmute, the small Alaskan town known as the "Halibut fishing capital of the world".  And the events of his first day in Alaska quicken the spin of his downward spiral.  This all serves to set up the most destructive force in his life: his insomnia (a motif that would have been terribly important even if they hadn't named the film after it).<p>Pacino and Nolan, in tandem, do a wonderful job of relaying the experience of insomnia to the audience.  Nolan uses self-consciously tricky camera work, exhibiting hallucinations and lack of focus.  Pacino uses an intense dreariness -- look at his eyes, even more hangdog than usual -- a slurring of speech, and a hunched over gait.  The startling thing is that neither allows Dormer to make excuses for his debilitating condition.  In fact, they allow Dormer to, in moments, flash some of his brilliance for the audience and, more importantly, his new Alaskan cop colleagues, to see.  The tragedy is that he just can't maintain it.<p>Pacino, who I find overbearing in his louder work, mines the same gold that yielded him Michael Corleone and the aging mobster in "Donnie Brasco".  He's quiet, introspective, but not averse to lashing out when the time is right.  It's an astounding performance that reminds you yet again why Pacino can be, when reined in, one of the most powerful and subtle actors ever captured on film.<p>Robin Williams' hyper-kinetic screen persona has worn thin in recent years.  But like Pacino, when he controls his energy he is astounding.  His work here is a prime example of that.  He plays Walter Finch, a wannabe-cop turned pulp crime novelist-cum-pocket philosopher, who is only a worthy adversary because Dormer is so out of it.  In any other circumstance, he'd be Dormer's breakfast, digested before lunch.  Williams is mostly controlled and cool throughout.  But he also allows all of Finch's insecurities to shine through.  He's not a perfect super-villain, just a man caught in an extreme situation, frantically using the tools he has to get out of it.  It is easily Williams' best work, trumping even his Oscar-winning turn in "Good Will Hunting".<p>Hillary Swank, the cast's third Oscar-winner, starts out slow as Ellie Burr, a local cop.  Her work felt manner and awkward, until you realize later on that she was supposed to be mannered and awkward.  She is putting on a good show for Dormer, a cop she idolizes.  Later on, however, Ellie becomes integral to the suspense: the audience, who know what's going on, become tense waiting for to get up to speed, unsure if she ever will and even if they want her to.<p>Besides his work with Pacino's psychology, Nolan ably uses all the elements on his director's palette to heighten and expand the suspense.  Quick, subliminal cuts jarringly remind us of important points in the action.  Extreme close-ups allude to secrets yet to be revealed.  And haunting imagery (the plane ride that opens the film, over an endless sea of jagged ice, comes to mind) set a solid tone.  His most accomplished sequence is shot through a dense fog.  Dormer is sure that there's a killer out there somewhere, brandishing a weapon, but he can't see him.  It's a terrific suspenseful moment.  All this dispels the notion that Nolan was a one-hit wonder with "Memento".  Clearly he's a talent we can expect a lot more from.<p>Some have claimed that "Insomnia" ends in a typical suspense movie fashion.  I couldn't disagree more.  I enjoyed these frantic scenes thoroughly, for they not only tidied up the plot, but were tempered by some bleak dark humour, a rhetorical device that periodically pops up, when needed, throughout the film.  So from top to bottom "Insomnia" is a solid piece of filmmaking, entertaining throughout, and psychologically thought provoking.  What more can one ask for?</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Insomnia (Christopher Nolan, 2002)<br /><br />I hate to think it's true, but having now seen Chris Nolan's other two films, Following and Insomnia, I'm starting to think Memento--one of the finest films ever made--was a one-shot deal.<br /><br />Insomnia, based on Erik Skoldbjaerg's brilliant 1997 film starring Stellan Skarsjard (of Good Will Hunting and The Glass House). Nolan's version--executive-produced by professional remake mangler Steven Soderbergh, who should be boiled in his own juices for what he did to Solaris--puts an on-the-edge Al Pacino in Skarsjard's role, and Pacino is the best thing about this movie hands-down. It's the first time since Dog Day Afternoon that he's played a character who's this unhinged both in his head and by the events around him, and we, the viewing audience, have sorely missed Mr. Crazy Pacino, thankyouverymuch. Unfortunately, Pacino is not given nearly as much to work with as was Skarsjard, and what he is given is as anemic as a nineteenth-century hypochodriac prescribed a convalescence of a length to be determined. (If only someone had done the same for Nolan.)<br /><br />All of the motivation of Skarsjard's character has disappeared (some for the sake of'-ugh'-'streamlining,' and some because American audiences, according to Hollywood, would have a real problem seeing a character with some of Skarsjard's character's nastier qualities portrayed in anything like a positive light), all of the ambiguity of two key scenes (the shooting in the fog and the ride to the dump) have disappeared, a key scene showing the depth to which the detective has sunk is lessened in its intensity, and most heretically, the ending is destroyed, all of which lead to a film that, had it been made on its own, may have been watchable. As a remake, however, it pales, and greatly, in comparison to the brilliant force unleashed upon us by Erik Skjoldbaerg in 1997. **</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>After scoring critical praise the world over with Memento, director Christopher Nolan was tapped to direct this remake of the 1997 Norwegian film of the same name.  Nolan suceeds where most other directors would have failed thanks to the brilliant cinematography and production design, giving the Alaskan setting and the overall film an atmospheric feel that sets Insomnia apart from other modern day thrillers.  Al Pacino is good as Detective Will Dormer who is after a killer (Robin Williams who is surprisingly effective in his role) and the two are great together in their game of cat &amp; mouse.  Hilary Swank however I felt was not effective at all until the climax of the film and for the most part was wasted in her role.  While the original Insomnia (which can be found as a Criterion Collection DVD) I find superior to this remake, this film is fantastic on it's own.  All in all, this was one of the best thrillers of 2002, and further cements Christopher Nolan as a visionary director.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UNMXBJSVIXFB.html">A2UNMXBJSVIXFB</a><br/><p>Movie - 4.5<br /><br />When I first saw the trailer for this some years ago, I thought it would turn into something along the lines of a cold and calculated murder mystery, a genre I'm sure Nolan would excel at if he took another shot at making one (a la Memento). Instead, I was presented with a complex character drama in addition to a back and forth trade-off of psychological mind games between the most unlikely duo I would ever have thought possible. Al Pacino is a given with his extensive track record and undeniable screen presence. His tact, detail to the little things, and natural vigor has always made him a great actor to watch on screen. But my biggest surprise was in Robin Williams. I've not seen his work in One Hour Photo, but his character in this film is definitely the darkest and most poignantly disturbing role I've seen him do to date. At times he's like a ticking time-bomb of undistilled rage and mounting frustration just waiting to explode. And yet, for a very good majority of his screen time he displays an almost creepy sense of control that manages to keep him aloof just when you think it's over. His character's natural ability of observation and the twisted kind of logic he possesses make for a great game of cat and mouse that keeps you suspended till the very end. The parallels between their personalities, the circumstances that brought them together, and the raw tension that propels them both to the point of breaking are all part of another finely-woven web that has a little bit of everything I like in a detective story. And while in somewhat of a limited role, Hilary Swank provides for a great sense of conscience and perspective in opposition to the insomniac behaviors of both Pacino and Williams' characters. I was surprised at how brisk the movie progressed having only seen it for the first time as of this review. It's a dark and very well-written piece of psychological thriller with just the right balance of drama and emotion.<br /><br />Video - 4.5<br /><br />As mentioned above, this BD is actually my first-ever viewing of the film. And while I don't have any theatrical or DVD experiences in mind for comparison, I still have to say the film looks wonderful. Wally Pfister's photography gets an excellent transfer, with bold, bold colors being the highlight of the video. From the very beginning of the movie when Pacino's character is flying over the mountains of Alaska (or wherever they filmed in British Columbia), we get a crystal clear image full of depth and detail. The aforementioned colors look especially lush throughout the countryside showcasing an array of greens, browns, and grays for that very laid-back Alaskan outdoorsy look. Black levels are deep and inky, while contrast is proportioned perfectly to give certain scenes ample dramatic and photographic effect. Skin tones remain very natural exposing a good deal of facial features from the wrinkles of a worn-down Pacino to the eerie smile on Williams' face when we get that side shot of him on the ferry. Overall image detail maintains a faithful and accurate level of sharpness for a lot of the indoor settings and is marred by little bit of edge enhancement, but isn't too distracting. My only gripe for an otherwise perfect picture is the period of frame-shaking during the funeral scene, but everything else is relatively flawless.<br /><br />Audio - 4.5<br /><br />Much like the video, I found the audio to be excellent as well. While a good majority of the film is dialogue, what few instances there are of surround usage via background noise, ambient town activity, running water, shuffling footsteps, or creaking wood, do their fair share of creating a deceptively buoyant DTS-HD track. Separation of said noises does a great job panning across the screen just as you'd see/hear them from the perspective of the camera. Directionality doesn't get a whole lot of work, but does so admirably when given the opportunity. A lot of it is done mainly through the sounds of nature and in combination with a tense, and sometimes haunting, score by David Julyan. But perhaps my favorite element, though to no surprise considering its rudimentary requirement, is the dialogue. Pacino, in conjunction to his unique acting, also has that very distinct raspy voice, which I have to say couldn't sound more perfect, especially for this type of movie. Meanwhile, Williams with a much more low-key performance, voice-wise, sounds equally impressive be it on screen or over the phone (again, it's creepy to hear him be.. so creepy). And for as good as the track sounds, the one detractor would have to be the LFEs. They're not bad, by any means, but for the limitations of what the movie is, their just isn't a whole lot of instances where strong bass is required outside of music and the occasional dramatic boom effect for the insomnia kicking in.<br /><br />Extras - 4.0<br /><br />There actually isn't a big abundance of production features aside from the set design and cinematography pieces, but they're informative enough about a lot of the technical side of things: locations chosen, things they had to build for said locations, types of filming techniques used to counteract elements of nature, and so on. There's also a quaint face-to-face conversation between Nolan and Pacino where Pacino basically gives pointers and little lessons he learned throughout his years of acting to Nolan, who seems very interested in the veteran's words. However, the real meat lies in the very informative commentaries: one by Nolan for the film itself and then one mishmash of selected scenes/commentaries by Hilary Swank and other members of the production crew. By far amongst the more interestingly arranged commentaries I've seen to date, Nolan gives insight for the entire project by going in the order of shooting, rather than the order of editing. What the production features lack in depth, Nolan more than makes up for it by explaining various aspects such as shooting, writing, casting, editing, and a wealth of other very informative tidbits relevant to the film. The scene-specific commentaries add some extra depth and perspective, mostly from a writing and shooting point, but are worth giving a listen to as well. Personally, though, I would've loved to have see a longer, more candid interview with Williams and hear the kinds of things he did to prepare for the role, as well as what he thought of his character, etc.<br /><br />Overall - 4.5<br /><br />I have to admit, as widely known as he is for his more mainstream titles (like The Prestige, Batman, and Inception), I have to say I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed Insomnia. It's an excellent combination of the calculated thriller aspects most people know him for, but also for, in my opinion, an equally excellent amount of character and psychological elements. For what handful of movies I've seen him in (still need to catch up on his classics), I never get tired of Al Pacino. And for always being the funny guy, I'm shocked at how good of a performance Robin Williams provided as well. With near-reference A/V quality and a great set of extras heralded by a very hearty Nolan commentary, Insomnia comes highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>Insomnia is already one of the best films of the year. Chris Nolan who brought has the excellent Memento follows up with this brilliant film. Al Pachino is great in the lead role but the scene stealer here is Robin Williams. When you see the film you'll know what I mean. I won't go into the plot all I'm saying is go see it</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>When I saw this film in the theaters back in 2002, I was blown away.  I had seen Christopher Nolan's Memento, and couldn't wait for his follow-up film.  I was impressed by the eclectic range of characters from Hilary Swank, Al Pacino, and Robin Williams - a combination that I may have put money down prior to this film the group that would never share screen time together.  I was wrong.  I also was eagerly anticipating what Nolan would do with this film, having not seen the original when I went to the theater; I knew that he would bring us a compelling drama that would pull the best out of our cast.  I was not disappointed.  When this film was released, I immediately bought it, poured it into my collection of films, and watched it at least a dozen times since then.  I loved the combination of acting between Pacino and Williams because they had two completely different styles.  I thought Swank was decent, but contributed very little to the simpleton character she was to play - and I thought that Maura Tierney as the reclusive innkeeper was a great fit.  I loved the way that Nolan filmed it, the cinematography was excellent, and the music kept me on the edge of my seat until the very, clich&eacute; ending.  I was in awe of this film - that is - until I saw the original.  Now, I find myself questioning the value of this film and of Nolan's honesty to the original director's vision.  It nearly makes me tear up to see a great, valued independent foreign film get the slap of U.S.D.A. Hollywood on it with bigger budgets, bigger scripts, and an ending that seemed like it arrived directly from the "How to build a great climax" handbook handed to new ... mainstream directors.<br /><br />For those looking for a review of just this version of Insomnia, I want to initially say that watching this film on its own is good.  If you have not seen the original, then this is a great eye candy film with fantastic scenes that prove that Nolan can conquer his trade if given the opportunity (remember what he did with the Batman legacy), but together these films do not match up and fans of the original will scoff at Nolan's poor attempt to bring the honesty and directness that director Erik Skjoldbj?rg superbly brought to the screen.  I understand that one, when making comments about Insomnia, should keep them separate, but there are so many disheartening differences between the two that I do not want others to purely watch this one with Pacino and Williams, but instead see the two and make their own assessments.  To begin, Pacino is no Stellan Skarsg?rd (as odd as that may be to say), but Skarsg?rd brings a character to the screen forcing us to follow the emotional level of the events, instead of Pacino's over-the-top reactions to situations.  While Skarsg?rd brings intensity to the character due to events and his "unknown" past, Pacino brings a visual to the character.  You cannot seem to take your eyes off Pacino, but that is just him being the actor that he is.  There are elements left out of Nolan's interpretation that are key to truly giving us the "bad cop" mentality that we are supposed to have about Dormer.  Oddly, in the original, we are not supposed to find ourselves liking or feeling sympathy for Skarsg?rd, but in this one we want to see Pacino come clean and rid himself of the guilt.  A big difference between the two films is the cross-referencing between Pacino and Skarsg?rd, because by seeing each of these two bring something new to the table, we, as viewers, saw a completely different film.<br /><br />Outside of the characters, Nolan's indiscreet changes do morph this film into something completely different that originally conceived.  To call this film a remake would be tough in my eyes, because it is not a remake.  It is a new interpretation of a classic film.  Nolan makes some small changes to the plot which ultimately changes that course of our characters and the overall tones of the film.  For example, there is quite a bit more Hollywood "running" in Nolan's film than in the original.  Skarsg?rd captures our attention because of his internal conflicts, while Nolan captures our attention in his film by forcing us to watch Pacino run Williams down, to see him screaming his lines at random characters, and the ending that just epitomizes the standard that Hollywood seems to embrace.  Without giving away too much detail, I must say that unlike the original, more gunfire is used, the intensity of the music is increased, and an event occurs with our main character that changes the original film completely.  That is why I cannot call this film a remake in any way shape or form.  This is an interpretation, albeit a very close interpretation, but not identical.  Nolan took chances, he changed the frame of the story, and gave us a pure 100% uncut slice of Hollywood that one could almost witness in any blockbuster released during the summer months.  It was pathetic and if I were the director of the original, Nolan's interpretation would have made me rather upset.<br /><br />Overall, I still like Nolan's work, and while I have lowered my enjoyment of this film after seeing this original, I must say that from 2002-present I thoroughly enjoyed Nolan's Insomnia.  So, where does that put us currently?  I would suggest this film to friends mainly because I am a sucker for Pacino's work (early and recent), and for some strange reason I cannot say "no" to a Robin Williams' film (even if this took place during his "dark" stint).  I also think that Nolan's craft is unmatched today, and while he will conform to Hollywood (i.e. Insomnia), he uses it to pay rent and finance his next films.  For that, I gotta respect him.  I will say this to friends as well, if you want to see a great film, one must see the original Insomnia and witness a truly disturbing character at his best.  Skarsg?rd is on the top of his game with version, and Pacino could not compete.  To summarize, together these two films cannot compare because the original is 100% better (because they ARE two separate films), but apart Nolan does cloak a good story with great cinematography.  So, I would suggest it.  Count me on the fence wit this one!!<br /><br />Grade: *** ? out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>A simple situation in cop country, L.A. California.

A virtual nobody in Hollywood until his sleeper hit, "Memento", Christopher Nolan appears to be the go-to guy for murder/mystery thrillers.  To Christopher Nolan's credit, after making the incredibly confusing "Memento", he chose to make a more straight-forward mystery thrill ride and the move pays off big time.<br /><br />"Insomnia" tells the story of LAPD detective Dormer (Al Pacino) who along with his partner, are sent up to Alaska to solve a startling murder of a teenage girl in a small quiet town.  The cops of this small town aren't sure what precipitated this murder, and they're not sure about the odd circumstances that surround the two LAPD detectives presence here, other than Dormer is a friend of the town's chief of police.  Things quickly get out of hand when a tip is given, as to the perpetrator's possible location, and a friendly fire accident leaves Dormer's partner dead and Dormer to blame for the shooting.  Things are only complicated further when the killer is the witness to the accidental shooting and knows that Dormer is trying to cover it up, because the reason LAPD sent them to Alaska, besides assisting in a murder investigation, was to get them away from Internal Affairs, and a "friendly-fire" altercation would seem greatly suspicious.  To top things off, it's the time of year in Alaska when there is constant sunlight, leaving Det. Dormer suffering from insomnia, and growing increasingly withdrawn and somewhat crazy.  With all of that occurring the killer chooses to use Dormer's guilt and cover-up as leverage in assisting him in placing the guilt of this small town girl's murder on someone else letting him off the hook.<br /><br />"Insomnia" is superbly acted and directed, with stand-out performances by Al Pacino (no surprise there), Robin Williams, and Hillary Swank.  Excellent cast, with great material to work with, all held together by an incredible director.

Although Christopher Nolan is certainly no Hitchcock, this intense suspense-thriller possesses the some of the qualities that make a true classic.  The story winds through the nightless town of Nightmute, Alaska, where LAPD detective Will Dormer (played by Al Pacino is an only par performance) investigates a troubling serial killer case.  When the investigation takes a sudden, twisting turn, Dormer not only is in pursuit of a killer, but is up against the sleepless psychological trauma that is disrupting his every move.<p>As Dormer gets closer and closer to the truth, he comes across a startlingly eerie author (Robin Williams), who happens to have vital information about concerning one of the victim's death.  As Dormer becomes more involved with the author, his paranoia grows increasingly unstable.  Williams steals the show throughout the second half of the film, portraying the role with ease; a haunting character that must have crept mightily out of his soul.  Hillary Swank is a some-what misused rookie officer who is one step behind Dormer in solving the case and her peformance is only fair.<p>Director Nolan uses the excellent Hilary Seitz to his advantage, plotting Dormer's fears and ambitions, tooling Pacino and Williams's characters in a battle of good and evil, yet the good and the evil are presented in an enigmatic, vague fashion that will keep viewers guessing.

But Detective Dormer (Al Pacino) can't sleep because it's always light out there. And when an incident occurs that Dormer covers up by blaming the killer, things get complicated...because the killer saw him do it...<br /><br />I strongly recommend this movie to everyone as it's a fascinating movie that will stick with you. I find it even worth a buy but if you want to see movies with plot twists or highly unpredictable endings, check out movies like Memento, The Usual Suspects, etc..</p></br><a href="../users/A2KB14WCZ1DVE3.html">A2KB14WCZ1DVE3</a><br/><p>I will try not to title the review with any references to sleep, or lack of it. Nor will I mention things like Al Pacino sleepwalking through his role. But it seems that this film was shot to make you have empathy with the lead character, a cop who has insomnia in a land where the sun never sets. Pacino does a credible job as a cop who really needs a good snooze, but all the pacing did for me was make me want to nap myself, and that's the problem. <p>The disappointment is that I was looking forward to the movie, especially the interaction with the killer. This is not the first movie that Al Pacino plays a cop who verbally confronts the bad guy before the inevitable violent end. He did it in "Heat" with Robert DiNiro, and in that picture there was blazing chemistry. Once again, maybe it's the sleep thing, but I really think the whole insomnia issue prevents any real electricity from happening. <p>I would have liked to have seen the movie redone without the whole lack of sleep thing. It drains the energy from the film. Robin Williams has shown he's a good dramatic actor, and can make a great villain, but let's try it again some time with Pacino in something different.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>Insomnia was Christopher Nolan's next film after Memento. He is moving up the ladder to the next level, with big name actors--Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hillary Swank. Not quite up to block buster status with The Dark Knight or Inception, but he is a rising star. Insomnia was a remake of the 1997 Insomnia by Norwegian director Erik Skjoldbj?rg.<br /><br />Instead of Norway, the remake is set in Alaska, so far North that the sun doesn't set for months. This wrecks havoc on the sleep cycles of Detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino), an LA cop who arrives to help with the investigation of the murder of a young woman. Besides the Midnight Sun, there is something else troubling the detective's sleep. Like MacBeth, he thinks that "sleep should knit the raveled sleeve of care" but sleep is no more. MacBeth, and Dormer, have murdered sleep. Dormer is under investigation by Internal Affairs for possibly fabricating evidence. As he tries to cover his tracks, he gets in deeper trouble.<br /><br />Rookie Detective Ellie Burr (Hillary Swank) looks up to Dormer, who she has studied in Detective School. She quotes from his text books, and is anxious to learn what she can from the man himself:<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Dormer: You shouldn't knock misdemeanors.<br />Det. Ellie Burr: Oh, but it's small stuff. It gets so boring.<br />Dormer: It's all about small stuff. You know, small lies, small mistakes. People give themselves away, same in misdemeanors as they do on murder cases. It's just human nature. Aren't you gonna write that down?<br />====================<br /><br />When this situation arrives in a film there is an interesting sub text, and that is that the young actor is playing a character who is learning from the more experienced character, and at the same time taking an acting class. This happened in The Color of Money where Tom Cruise played a pool hustler being schooled by Fast Eddie, played by Paul Newman. Al Pacino takes Swank to school, and really gives an amazing performance. Robin Williams also gets a chance to stretch his acting chops playing the enigmatic suspect, Finch. Swank is a quick learner, and her performance is solid.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Dormer: We better find out where this came from.<br />Det. Ellie Burr: I tried. Mrs. Connell doesn't know, her friends didn't know.<br />Dormer: Have you tried the jewelry stores? Small things, remember? The second you're about to dismiss something, think about it. Look at it again.<br />Det. Ellie Burr: Want me to write that down?<br />Dormer: No, I'll remember it.<br />====================<br /><br />Director Christopher Nolan is also going to film school, but he is a quick learner, too. This film presented some interesting challenges. First and foremost, how do you depict insomnia without providing a cure for insomnia? Without putting the audience to sleep? The far North setting was beautiful, but all that white snow could be monotonous. Scenes in the fog were good at creating an atmosphere where the lines between right and wrong were blurred, but it could also lull you into a trance. The film was a murder mystery, but it was less concerned with finding who did it then it was with exploring moral dilemmas. The ways in which the detective and the killer were similar. If you do something wrong for the right reasons, does that make it OK? What happens once you cross that line...<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Dormer: This guy crossed the line and didn't even blink.<br />====================<br /><br />I don't see you blinking either, Detective. Maura Tierney plays the Detective's landlady, Rachel Clement. She has an interesting take on moral dilemmas, too.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Rachel Clement: I can't judge. There are two kinds of people in Alaska: those who were born here and those who come here to escape something. I wasn't born here.<br />====================<br /><br />I wish this character could have been developed a little more. Just what it was she was escaping was never resolved.<br /><br />The Bottom Line is that Insomnia is a solid effort by Christopher Nolan on his way to bigger and better things. I would preferr to just watch the original--besides I heard that it was darker, and some of the changes kind of watered it down. In the original his interrogation techniques are much harsher, and instead of firing his gun in a dead dog to fabricate some evidence, he kills a dog. Great performances by Swank, Pacino, and Williams, in a setting that makes a good metaphor for the grey area between wake and sleep, and right and wrong. Like Detective Ellie Burr we are left with a question:<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Det. Ellie Burr: Why?<br />Dormer: Don't lose your way.<br />====================<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXZ4">Memento</a> (2000) Directed by Christopher Nolan<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783226845">Scent of a Woman</a> (1992) Al Pacino was Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKG9">Glengarry Glen Ross</a> (1992) Al Pacino was Ricky Roma<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JO5L">Cruising (Deluxe Edition)</a> (1980) Al Pacino was Steve Burns<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006CXI1">Death to Smoochy (Widescreen Edition)</a> (2002) Robin Williams was Rainbow Randolph<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006LA87">One Hour Photo</a> (2002) Robin Williams was Seymour Parrish<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000714BP">To Wong Foo Thanks for Everything Julie Newmar</a> (1995) (uncredited) Robin Williams was John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767837991">Shakes the Clown</a> (1991) (as Marty Fromage) Robin Williams was Mime Class<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CWN3">Boys Don't Cry</a> (1999) Hillary Swank was Brandon Teena<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783227361">Dazed and Confused</a> (1993) Nicky Katt was Clint Bruno<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Finch: You forgot the wild card, Will.<br />====================</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>I was originally drawn to this film because of director Christopher Nolan.  After viewing his Batman re-boots (Batman Begins & The Dark Knight) and enjoying them immensely, I was hopefully that Nolan's other works would provide some of the same.  In the case of Insomnia, he makes a much more "traditional" film, shrouded in a bit of false advertising to make it seem a bit more mysterious than it really is.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, the film centers on policeman Will Dormer (Al Pacino), who travels to an Alaskan town to try and solve a murder case.  With an Internal Affairs investigation breathing down his neck back home, Dormer is under intense pressure to succeed in this new arena.  While teaming with local cop Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), Dormer not only struggles to solve the case, but also gets mixed up with mysterious writer Walter Finch (Robin Williams).<br /><br />On the whole, this movie functions pretty well as a traditional cop drama.  It has the murder mystery, the gun shootouts, and the intrigue plotline which questions the integrity of pretty much everyone involved.  Without looking for anything more, this would be a very solid film.<br /><br />However, the film is advertised/promoted as so much more than just a cop drama.  The title itself indicates that the condition of insomnia will play a big role in the film, but it does not (Dormer not sleeping doesn't seem to add anything to the plot).  Robin Williams's role is billed as a taut, psychological thrill-ride, but he doesn't make an appearance until an hour into the movie and even after that point is severely underutilized.  Also, Swank's character is introduced as a potential key part in the film, but she (like Williams) just isn't given anything interesting to do.<br /><br />Thus, I can only give this film an "average" rating due to its inability to rise above a simple cop drama.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>This finely wrought remake of the Norwegian film of the same name (1997)--an excellent film by the way--is something close to a thriller masterpiece flawed only by a too-hurried resolution.  Christopher Nolan, whose strikingly original Memento (2000) is among the best films made in recent years, planned this out very carefully, tying up most of the loose ends without relying on any phony motivation, which we sometimes see in passionate cop dramas.  However, the guns blazing at the end was a cheap way out of this psychologically complicated story.  Still, I think we can overlook that small fault since the rest of the film is so very well done.<p>The incomparable Al Pacino gives a mesmerizing performance as Los Angeles police detective Will Dormer who is sent with his partner north to Alaska ostensibly to help in a murder investigation.  However we quickly learn that being out of town may help him and his partner avoid an Internal Affairs investigation to which Dormer may be vulnerable.  By the way, "dormir" in French means "to sleep," which is something Dormer does not do for six days, which is very close to the edge of human tolerance.  Indeed Dormer's last line in the film is "Just let me sleep."<p>Pacino is supported by Robin Williams as Walter Finch, a morally-deranged mystery writer who doesn't appear until the film is about half over.  He makes up for keeping us waiting with a dramatic performance that will curl your toes.  He is even more despicable than Bjorn Floberg was in the Norwegian film.  Not only is Robin Williams's appearance subtly altered and his demeanor strange, even his voice is not the same.  He is a long way from Good Morning, Vietnam (1987) and Mrs. Doubtfire (1993), but I think this is, in a more modest way, one of his best performances.<p>Also featured is Hilary Swank, whom you should see in Boys Don't Cry (1999) if you haven't, as Ellie Burr, an ingenue Alaskan detective in awe of the master cop from the big city.  Notable in a modest role is Jonathan Jackson as Randy Stetz, a high schooler with a chip on his shoulder.  I also liked the brief appearance by Katharine Isabelle, who played the murder girl's trampy girlfriend.<p>The key psychological question in both films is why does Will Dormer decide to cover up the accidental shooting?  In director Erik Skjoldbjaerg's 1997 film the answer is human nature.  That certainly worked, but was not enough for Nolan, and so he gives us Dormer's Internal Affairs problems back in L.A. as further motivation.  This works very well for two reasons: One, it is convincing.  Recall his spontaneous confession to the hotel clerk (Maura Tierney).  And two, the cop problems in Los Angeles are right out of the headlines of recent years.  They are real.  Nolan even has Ellie find a copy of the Los Angeles Times with one of the stories on the front page.<p>The next psychological question is, is the villain a serial killer in the making?  If he is, then Dormer must stop him regardless of his own problems.  And therein lies the internal conflict of the film so well projected by Al Pacino.  We know that there is something more than the midnight sun to account for Dormer's disintegration.  He is a flawed cop.  Like some of his real life counterparts in L.A. and elsewhere he took it upon himself, by falsifying evidence, to administer justice to a man he knew was guilty.  When he did that, he knew (and this is something he teaches Ellie) that he had lost his integrity as a cop.  The temptation to frame somebody we know is guilty of a horrendous crime is very great and many of us would fall into it.<p>Since I cannot discuss the ending here in any concrete way, let me just say that if Nolan had really taken his time with the ending he might have had Dormer simply murder the villain and face the consequences (or even commit suicide).  But I suspect Nolan believed that the heroic character of his star would have been compromised.  In Skjoldbjaerg's film the police detective actually shoots the dog to obtain the spent bullet he needs.  In Nolan's film the dog is already dead.  I think this minor blush of character actually taints Nolan's film to some small degree and leads Nolan down the path to the Hollywood ending to come.  But judge for yourself<p>One final point.  A lot can be gotten out of a single camera shot.  This is something that Nolan does very well.  A case in point is the shot on the plastic evidence bag holding the bullet that Dormer picks up in the lab.  Nolan has the camera show us the words on the bag, "chain of custody," and he has the camera linger long enough for us to read them.  This nice touch reminds us that THAT very chain of custody is being compromised, another echo of real life criminal investigations from recent years in L.A.<p>See this for Al Pacino, at his best here, one of the great stars of our era whose ability to command the screen is second to none.</p></br><a href="../users/A10X0JN8KTK89H.html">A10X0JN8KTK89H</a><br/><p>Sleep disorders are not new to murder mysteries, but the way Christopher Nolan represents insomnia visually is at least as wonderful as Al Pacino's patient acting.  Pacino plays a detective from L.A., Will Dormer, who is sent to Alaska to help out an old friend with a murder case.  Dormer and his partner (played by Martin Donovan) are under investigation by Internal Affairs in L.A., so there's more to this temporary transfer than assisting a fellow badge.<br /><br />In Alaska, it's light all day and every day when Dormer and his partner arrive, and Dormer has insomnia.  Pacino gradually slows his character's actions and reactions down until I felt that he was severely debilitated and in danger.  He makes mistakes: some deliberate, others on accident, and still others he isn't sure of.  The latter make for the most intriguing part of this well-constructed thriller.<br /><br />Hillary Swank plays the smart, plucky detective, Ellie Burr, who is stuck serving misdemeanors instead of actual collars.  She has studied Dormer's career and admires him.  Swank plays the role without overreaching.  I cannot say the same for Pacino.  Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Jack Nicholson all suffer from the same affliction: As great as they are as actors, their personalities are greater.  I cannot watch them in films and pretend that they are anyone but themselves.  I still enjoy their performances, but they are decidedly bigger than any of the characters they have ever played.  They just can't help it.<br /><br />Maura Tierney gives an excellent but thankless performance as the front desk clerk (or manager) of the hotel where Dormer and his partner stay.  She softens Pacino in a way that Swank is unable to do.  Or maybe Pacino tempers himself; it's hard to tell.<br /><br />Robin Williams, as Walter Finch, is quite excellent at being creepy.  The banter between Finch and Dormer is something of a throwback to a different time: "You're my job," says Dormer when Finch maneuvers for sympathy.  They seem to know each other as if from across the room, not like lovers, but like familiar character types in a familiar story.<br /><br />And Nolan isn't trying to do anything entirely new in Insomnia.  He's telling you a story you already know.  He twists it slightly with great visual effects and a cold, blue camera lens.  As much as I enjoy the film, it's not perfect.  The screenplay is written into a corner, and the ending is easy to see a mile away.  Likewise, some of the dialogue between Dormer and Finch is heavy-handed and cheesy.<br /><br />At its heart, this is the story of a downfall.  Don't judge the film by its murder/mystery/suspense genre tag.  Character takes precedence over plot.  It's not as good as Nolan's Memento, but Nolan's craft leaves its marks.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>Insomnia will do no harm to the reputations of the people involved in its making. Chris Nolan continues to perfect his skills as a filmaker, Al Pacino gives us another great performance, Robin Williams manages the near super-human task of suppressing his Robin Williamsness (i.e. manic comic genius),and gives a thoughtful and spot-on character performance, and Hillary Swank does nicely in a supporting role. The thriller is taut and complex and takes place in a new and interesting setting.<p>Too bad there was an original movie of Insomnia, that takes place in Norway, that has much of the same elements but also some great differences. If one has seen both, the comparisons & contrasts are impossible to avoid. Al Pacino gives a terrific performance as the bleary-eyed sleepless detective, but Stellan Skarsgard in the Norwegian version is no slouch at acting either.<p>I won't go into detail on the changes and diversions in both films. I recommend that movie buffs see both, as they are different films, despite sharing relatively the same story. <p>I find the European version is more enigmatic, not drawn in bold black and whites, and with a feeling of life's quixotic accidents. The central crime/cover-up by the detective is motiveless in the Norwegian version, in the American film there is an added subtext that either deepens or makes simpler the detective's actions, depending upon your point of view. The byplay between the murderer and the detective is more complex in the American, and more subtle and less defined in the European. Pacino is a man with troubles, Skarsgard is a troubled man. <p>But finally, the big difference is in the ending. I was disappointed that the American version opted to end everything in a typically American fashion, with a bullet, and all strands wrapped up in a bow. The American film is inexorable and predestined, the Norwegian film more open to happenstance and accident. The European version leaves the end enigmatically unresolved. I won't say which is best. That, each viewer will have to decide for themselves.<p>Both versions are well worth your interest.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Insomnia starring Al Pacino and Robin Williams is pretty boring for a Christopher Nolan film, this is the second film after the brilliant psychological thriller Memento. Insomnia just drags and drags with every minute that passes, even with two famous actors you can't take this film seriously. Hilary Swank is pretty much under-used here, I hated everything about this film. Don't watch this train wreck!</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>If you like detective stories, you will probably like this. But don't expect "whodunnit" to be the main issue; that is disclosed fairly early on. It's more who is going to find out, what are going to be the consequences, and how are the various characters going to get themselves out of the fine mess they've gotten into.<br /><br />Al Pacino play Detective Will Dormer, invited to a small town in northern Alaska to help with a murder and also to get him out of LA, where an Internal Affairs investigation is cooking. His partner Hap is with him, and explains that he is going to have to make a deal with IA to save his own skin and protect his family. He says Dormer won't be dragged into the mess, but Dormer insists he will be. (We find out later why.)<br /><br />Dormer and Hap are met by an attractive young female local detective who is to work with them. She's smart, and she idolizes Dormer. She did her case study at the academy on one of his most famous cases. The local police chief is a friend of Dormer's, and it was undoubtedly he who asked for Dormer to come and assist.<br /><br />The case is the brutal murder of an 18-yea-old girl whose body was found naked in the garbage dump. Dormer immediately notices some unusual features about the body, and finds some useful evidence at the girl's home. (Nah, not going to tell you what.) He and the local cops interview the girl's boyfriend, but Dormer is convinced he was not the killer. (Not going to tell you why, either.)<br /><br />The primary suspect turns out to be a mystery writer who lives about 15 miles away (Robin Williams) who has befriended the girl because she wanted to be a writer, and because she needed someone to talk to. He's very smooth, this one; after all he's a writer of murder mysteries, and knows how police operate.<br /><br />The title refers to the fact that it is high summer, and the sun basically never goes down. Dormer can't sleep, and he is tormented by, among other things, phone calls from the writer in the wee small hours of the morning because he can't sleep either. Eventually, Dormer is so in need of sleep that he's going really nuts. Practically gets himself killed falling asleep while driving, and eventually begins having hallucinations. He's determined to crack the case before he cracks up, and he does. In a way.<br /><br />Watch it; you'll be glad I didn't tell you too much.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ.html">A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ</a><br/><p>At first, I received the packaging that had two, double-sided DVD's.

Utilizing his adept understanding of the human psyche, he creates a film that is both haunting and suspenseful. Though it may not keep you lying awake at night, Insomnia will surely keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />When Detective Will Dormer and his partner, Hap Eckhart are asked to leave behind their native city of Los Angeles to help solve a murder case in a small Alaskan town, they have no idea of the dangers that await them. While in pursuit of a possible suspect Will accidentally shoots and kills Hap, having mistaken him for the suspect. But was it really an accident? Back in L.A. Hap was being asked to testify against Will, who had been using some unorthodox and illegal methods to serve justice. Will reluctantly covers up his role in Hap's death so as to avoid suspicion as to whether or not the shooting was intentional. Now Will is consumed by guilt and is unable to sleep. His insomnia grows more intense, and as he's in part of Alaska where the sun doesn't set for months, he blames his sleepless condition on the light. Yet there are two people who know what's really keeping him awake at night. Ellie Burr, a young and intelligent Alaskan detective, begins to see that Will is clearly disturbed by something and she is compelled to find out what. Meanwhile a strange, reclusive pulp novelist named Walter Finch begins calling Will. Finch says that he witnessed Hap's death at Will's hands, but he won't tell the authorities so long as Will agrees to help him in return. What presents a problem is the fact that Walter Finch is the very murder suspect that Will was pursuing when the accidental shooting occurred. And there can be no denial that Walter Finch is a killer. The two men find themselves forced to work together to conceal their mutual guilt, but when Detective Ellie Burr starts to uncover the truth, Will is faced with a moral dilemma. Shall he admit his faults, lose his job, and suffer the legal ramifications for what happened in L.A. and for what happened to Hap... or shall he choose to align himself with sociopathic Walter Finch in order to save himself? And what of Ellie Burr, whose youthful enthusiasm and integrity Will has come to respect and admire? Can he protect her from the truth that incriminates him and will inevitably lead her to Walter?<br /><br />Abandoning the complex narrative structure of his previous film Memento for a more straightforward storytelling style, Nolan manages to maintain a high level of suspense. He also uses numerous visual tricks to keep viewers interested in the conflicts of the characters. As Will Dormer becomes more exhausted the lights become brighter, things seem to move about him without reason, and he begins to experience hallucinations and extreme confusion. What is so remarkable is that, through all of this the viewer is able to follow the sequence of events and differentiate between reality and illusion.<br />The cast features Al Pacino as Detective Will Dormer, Robin Williams as Walter Finch, and Hilary Swank as Detective Ellie Burr. Not a member of the cast gives a bad performance and each of them manage to hold their own, which is a feat in itself. Hilary Swank, in particular, is great as the young idealistic Ellie Burr. Also adding an unforgettable presence to the film is Robin Williams who creates a truly frightening villain, and yet at the same time he's so charismatic that you almost sympathize with him. As for Pacino, he gives a strong performance but it's nothing that he doesn't normally do on a regular basis.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002HOERG">Strangers on a Train</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000069HZU">The Long Goodbye</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000053UIE">...And Justice for All</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009UC7R0">Witness</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LP6KNU">The Silence of the Lambs</a></p></br><a href="../users/AR1T36GLLAFFX.html">AR1T36GLLAFFX</a><br/><p>"Insomnia" is a 2002 film that explores the inner workings of a top detective (Al Pacino as Wll Dormer) as he nears the end of a brillant career as a police investigator, who is so feed up with the obviously guilty going free that he's starting to compromise his vaulted integrity to make sure justice is done.<br /><br />The wild beauty of the Alaskian landscape should have gotten second-billing behind Pacino, as it plays an intregral in several parts of the movie.  As it is, Hilary Swank, Robin Williams and Paul Dooley are memorable in their roles as an eager police detective, a murder suspect, and the crusty local police chief, respectively.<br /><br />How does it all mesh?  Well, indeed, as an increasingly tired Dormer (played well, as usual, by Pacino) careens from mistake to coverup, until he has a change of heart, salvaging his career along the way.<br /><br />However, Amazon lists this as an 'essential video'.  It's a good movie, but it's not in the league of, say, Casablanca, The Wizard of Oz, The Seven Samuri, and so on.<br /><br />I'd rate this a four-star film.  Recommended, primarily of Pacino's usual excellent acting.  Williams is also notable for his low-keyed, everyman, but chilly, role.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>Anybody remember Memento? The independent film that critics and movie lovers in general loved so much but never got the public attention or the award recognition that it probably deserved? This wasn't so much a big deal for Newmarket, the studio that distributed the film, since the film went on to make nearly three times its budget but this has to be somewhat upsetting for the filmmakers who wanted more from their work but life goes on. The director of Memento, who is currently in the works with the new Batman project, went on to a new film called Insomnia, based on a Norwegian film of the same name. What makes this film interesting is the casting of certain roles within the film. No, its not just Al Pacino, though he does add some flavor of dramatic talent to the film, it's the casting of Robin Williams as the killer. Williams, who is best known for his comedic performances in Popeye, Aladdin and Hook, isn't the first choice that comes to mind in this area but if it works, the film could spawn a cult status on the same level as Memento.<p>The story centers on the investigation of a murder in Alaska and the cat and mouse game that the killer instigates with one of the detectives. When a teenage girl is found murdered in a small town in Alaska, a veteran police detective and his partner are sent up to over-see an official investigation. Just as the two close in on the primary suspect of the murder, the veteran detective accidentally kills his partner in a chase, believing he was the murderer. The detective then lies about the accidental homicide and gets away with it. But he soon finds out that he isn't the only living soul who saw it happen. The murderer calls up the detective, who is racked with guilt, and plans to blackmail him into letting him go free. Now the veteran police detective must choose what means more to him, his life or his commitment to justice. The story for Insomnia does a wonderful job at dealing with conflicts of the human psyche when it comes to guilt but wasn't as surprising as Memento was. But this is a small issue as it is hard to follow up to such a critical success was that film was with many critics.<p>Though the cast of Insomnia represents a wide range of actors and actresses from different performance backgrounds, it doesn't change the fact that they work perfectly together. Al Pacino in the role of the veteran detective brings the film a sense of seniority, which is a good thing in this case, and plays the character perfectly all the way to the end. He showcases a man truly racked with guilt in such a way that it allows his character to really connect with audience members without giving the end to the feature away. Even though it may seem a weird choice for the role of the killer, Robin Williams gives an impressive performance in this film. The veteran comedian seems to be really be adding up his dramatic performances with roles in other adult-oriented features like One Hour Photo and Death to Smoochy and adds to his impressive resume that includes an Oscar winning performance in Good Will Hunting. Hilary Swank, as good as she could have been in this film, isn't given much, in the area of material, that allows her to really expand her acting ability.<p>Overall, despite lack the suspense and the surprising twists of its predecessor, Memento, Christopher Nolan gives an impressive follow-up with Insomnia that stands above most cop thrillers. The problems lie in the feature's time-length, which felt longer then it should have been, and its pacing, which seemed dragged down in certain areas. The lack of usable material for smaller characters with the film, like Hilary Swank, was a shame in there was a lot of potential for several enjoyable performances but nothing developed. Other then that, Insomnia gives an engaging view into the human psyche and the effects of guilt on the subconscious combined with amazing dramatic performances from Al Pacino and Robin Williams.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EI65WJC85U68.html">A1EI65WJC85U68</a><br/><p>Hollywood seems to have a love affair with remakes. A few years back it was hip to remake French films, then it was film versions of old TV shows, and every year there seems to be a "Sequelitis" epidemic in multiplexes worldwide. But INSOMNIA offers a Hollywood rarity: This is a remake of a NORWEGIAN movie.<br />While my opening comments don't offer much hope for the film, INSOMNIA is actually a great movie once you get into it. Starring Oscar winners Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank, executive produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney and directed by Christopher Nolan director of the vastly overrated MEMENTO, INSOMNIA is a compelling mystery thriller.<br />When cop Will Dormer (Pacino) witnesses the murder of his partner, the prime suspect is mystery writer Walter Finch (Williams). But while Finch appears accommodating to the police, chronic insomniac Dormer finds himself receiving taunting calls from Finch in the middle of the night. Dormer's investigation leads him to a remote Alaskan town which never sees nightfall during the spring/summer seasons where he is partnered with local cop Ellie Burr (Hillary Swank). But with the combination of the continued threats from his unseen nemesis and the stress of the investigation, Dormer's sleeping disorder is wearing him down and disorientating him, making him an easier target.<br />Like MEMENTO, INSOMNIA is full of twists and is beautifully photographed. But thankfully unlike it, INSOMNIA has a plot that makes sense and keeps the viewer glued to the screen; but it is the strong characterisations by Pacino and Williams that make their cat-and-mouse game utterly compelling. I haven't seen the Norwegian version, but as far as remakes go its probably a pretty safe bet that INSOMNIA is in the upper ranks.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YHKSTVSYEYTU.html">A1YHKSTVSYEYTU</a><br/><p>Insomnia is of course a remake of a Norwegian film starring Stellan Skarsgard, directed by Erik Skjoldbjaerg in 1997 but as much as this may make me a heathen to European film culture, I must confess to having never seen the original. However, thanks to one of my good friends (Steve, take a bow) I was lucky enough to see the UK premier of Insomnia as the closing movie of the 2002 Edinburgh film festival and lucky enough to see and hear the Director Christopher Nolan say a few words about this fine movie.<br /><br />Opening with incredibly stunning cinematography of Alaskan ice fields, haggard L.A police detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and his partner Hep Eckhart (Martin Donovan) arrive in America's most northerly city to help solve the brutal killing of a teenage girl. Met by a local Detective (Hilary Swank) who openly hero-worships Dormer and his successful career as a Detective, Pacino's character sets about showing the local hicks how it's done. However, it soon transpires that Dormer is only in Alaska in the first place to avoid an ongoing criminal investigation by police Internal Affairs back in Los Angeles and it is not long before his investigation into the Alaskan girl's murder goes horribly wrong. Troubled by his conscience and the never-ending daylight of an Alaskan summer Dormer prays for sleep.<p>For many people that have seen either of Christopher Nolan's previous two movies (Following and Memento) Insomnia may seem like an odd choice; it's a `mainstream' Hollywood movie (Warner Brothers studio), it is told in a linear timeframe and it's a remake. However, there must have been obvious attractions apart from the budget and his paycheck. First off, Stephen Soderbergh, who successfully makes mainstream movies with an Indie heart, oversaw production and secondly there was the chance to work with great actors such as Pacino, Swank and Robin Williams, although at this point I have to add that I believe Williams was totally miscast and made an unconvincing villain.<p>There are some wonderful scenes in this movie, including a nightmare like chase over hundreds of floating logs and the hunt for the killer in a freezing fog. It is also a movie that allows it's stars to shine and this is undoubtedly Pacino's best role (and best movie for many a year) and it is a pleasant change to see him with a decent script in an intelligent movie instead of hamming it up in the likes of The Devil's Advocate, alongside walking surfboard Keanu Reeves. This movie will also undoubtedly and deservedly enhance the careers and reputations of both Director Christopher Nolan and Hilary Swank, who both produce work of depth and subtlety. However, I also feel that much of the credit for what is a beautiful photographed and well-written movie should go to Wally Pfister and (for what is an excellent adapted screenplay) to Hilary Seitz. Insomnia is an excellent movie made by a very modest, very talented young British movie Director. Be warned though, you probably need an IQ to fully appreciate it.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>Al Pacino, cast in the role of an aging Los Angeles detective, is sent to Alaska to solve a murder case.  He's also there to distance himself from an Internal Affairs Investigation going on in which his partner, played by Martin Donovan, is going to testify against him.  The stage is set for conflict, and the Alaskan summer season, where it's daylight all the time, adds to Pacino's fatigue and disorientation as he finds it impossible to sleep.  This is an icy wonderland, and the cinematography is excellent, capturing the unremitting sunshine as a spotlight of sorts on Pacino's past guilty conscience.  He's true to character throughout though, bending the rules for his own purposes.  And when he commits an act that might cast him in an unfavorable light, he again makes concessions to his conscience.  It's a great role and he's a fine actor.<br /><br />Robin Williams is cast as bad guy, an unusual part for him.  He does a good job in the role, as does Hillary Swank as the Alaskan detective working on the case that quickly becomes more and more complex.  Generally, I enjoyed the film.  It's a fast paced drama about a cop and an unsolved mystery.  But although it is done well, it never really rises above its genre.  It held my interest at the time, but I just saw it yesterday, and already I'm beginning to forget it.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Al Pacino's acting once again is a highlight of a film he's in. He has the capacity to dominate a film with his presence. In this re-make of the Norwegian film, Pacino is excellent as a good-yet-tainted policeman who starts to unravel after not sleeping for four or five days. The Alaskan summer, with light 24 hours of day, can do that to visitors<br /><br />Robin Williams, meanwhile, plays a killer. It's funny how comedians can do so well playing dramatic roles and Williams is a prime example. He's especially good at creepy nut-cases (See "One Hour Photo") Williams doesn't enter the movie until about halfway through and he's fascinating in a low-key role (until the end).<br /><br />For a modern-day crime film, this doesn't have a lot of action but that's fine if the acting is this good and the story involving. Here, the acting is better than the story. Kudos to Hillary Swank, too, for her performance as the cop.<br /><br />The Alaskan scenery ain't bad, either.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KL7NXOAGKD3U.html">A3KL7NXOAGKD3U</a><br/><p>Due to working at a video store, and being interuppted by customers, I had to watch this one twice.  Content was excellent, and it was one of those that you just have to find out what happens!! Robin Williams was great in the movie as well. One of the best dark and sinister characters he has played!!  Al Pacino does a great job with the material!! Fun, edge of your seat entertainment!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>This is definitely one of the most powerful films I've ever seen. The story is basically a remake of a classic foreign film, where a detective is trying to solve a murder case in a small town that never gets dark. After having trouble sleeping for days, the detective soon finds himself caught in a world of confusion and lies. Al Pacino and Robin Williams deliver very captivating performances in this film, so it's no wonder why this film did so well. This film is probably one of the deepest films ever made going over powerful themes like lust or love, justice or injustice, truth or perception that are often questioned throughout the film. And it somehow works, to where the film manages to blur the perception of right or wrong to the point where the audience can't tell the difference. Overall, this is definitely another great film by two of Hollywood's finest actors.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FS9R0JXHLHEG.html">A1FS9R0JXHLHEG</a><br/><p>I would never give Insomnia a definition - a thriller yet sunshine set, a cat-and-rat game yet also rat-jolts-cat, a cruelty murder line yet faded in the psycho confusion. Everything in Insomnia seemed to free out the stereotypes as it's supposed to be. Things of this kind can always be boring and pale if not for atmospheric direction and top-notch performances.<p>Starring three Oscar winners, Insomnia follows its artistic pacing without losing any commercial attraction. Al Pacino, a top favourite of mine, is prominent again as a sleep-losing yet conscionable veteran cop, occasionally losing his mind but never losing his heart. Robin Williams, gives a convincing flick of a devil shielded with a writer's position. He's shrewd and almost controlling before you, yet fragile and vulnerable behind. The only regret is that the character was reduced at it's screenplay level, with only forty minutes screen time. Williams leads the role as a dominant yet also an undercurrent, with a dark impact, which was insinuated in the endless shining set and Al Pacino's progressive sleeplessness.<p>Beyond these two men's insomnia circle, Swank, portrayed an idolizing yet astute enough young cop, timely refreshing you and rightfully-oriented when you are becoming fatigued and confused with the two men's psychological battle. Slightly pale yet still lovable at the same time. Maura Tierney also lends a helping hand as the Hotel manager who sympathises with Pacino's character.<p>Director Chris Nolan covered all these twists with atmospheric directing, not showing off yet blatant which, normally seen in Hollywood thrillers, restrains story-telling and thought-evoking. He delivered a masterpiece which you can see many times without being bored.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>Pacino and his partner played by Martin Donovan(Agent Cody Banks) are set to a town where there is not darkness, or where they see no moon but its sunshiny out. their investigating a murder of a young girl and the killer is on the loose. Pacino partners up with Hilary Swank(Boys Dont Cry) and Nicky Katt(Suburbia), and they go to a place by the lake where they might find the killer, surley enough some nicely done suspense is put in there as Pacino shoots his partner on accident and kills him and he covers it up and the real killer saw it, who just happens to be Mr. Robin Williams(who is creepy and mind-blowing). its a great game between them and it ends with Williams shooting Pacino and then Pacino shotgun blasts Williams and then Pacino confesses to Swank about everything as she holds him on that walkway. if your renting movies or buying, rent or buy this one or Williams other creepy movie One Hour Photo</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>Masterfully-woven remake of the 1997 Norweigan film about an L.A. cop (Al Pacino) who succumbs to corruption in a northern town where the sun never sets.  A wonderfully entertaining thriller from director Christopher Nolan (MEMENTO), who proves he is a truly outstanding filmmaker.  Hillary Seitz provides the script; David Julyan composes the score; there's also some really great editing (Dody Dorn) here.  Pacino is terrific, although he's much changed since films like THE GODFATHER and SCARFACE; Robin Williams proves he's a master of acting with his first role as a villain; Hilary Swank is great as well, as the cop who returns Pacino's rest.  One of the best films of 2002, no doubt about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FDW1SPYKB354.html">A1FDW1SPYKB354</a><br/><p>I'm actually reviewing the "Widescreen" version of Insomnia. But had to use the Full Screen link (none available on the Widescreen page at the time of review).<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film, which features excellent performances (IMO) by the three leads (Al Pacino, Hilary Swank, and Robin Williams, in a rare evil role).<br /><br />Pacino really gives you the impression he has insomnia here, looking pretty ragged around the edges for much of the picture. It's almost impossible (for me) to not like a Pacino picture.  He's great in just about everything. And this is no exception.<br /><br />The DVD's commentary tracks are rather unique. Director Nolan takes us through the film chronologically, in the order in which it was filmed, starting with Day 1 (which is Scene #111!).<br /><br />The other commentaries are scene specific, which I like much better than having to watch the entire movie a second time just for the commentaries, which are oft times filled with silence.  I wish every DVD had commentaries like the ones on "Insomnia".  Excellent!<br /><br />And how about that Easter Egg?!  Outstanding!  Clicking on that pencil next to Hilary in the "Production Diaries" area of the DVD will enable you to witness an avalanche that occurred during the film's production. The quick-thinking Wally Pfister (Insomnia's Director of Photography) was able to record the moment on video tape. We even get a glimpse of Hilary Swank at the end of this short clip, who comments on witnessing this unforseen event: "It was so awesome!"<br />This has got to be one of the coolest Eggs I've yet to encounter on a disc!<br /><br />All-in-all, a Grade-A film and DVD presentation.</p></br><a href="../users/AWEOR1WZSMBEZ.html">AWEOR1WZSMBEZ</a><br/><p>That was the advice received by Dormer after being unable to sleep for almost a week.  The real reason to his insomnia is a combination of guilt from an 'accident/crime' he committed &amp; his inability to adjust to Nightmute where the sun always shines.  How he handles his personal problems at the same time solve a mystery is worth the wait &amp; watch. <p>Here is another film directed by Christopher Nolan.  A very straightforward film without the twists or the unchronological sequence of Memento where he was recognized -- but nonetheless as intese.  A power cast led by Pacino, Williams &amp; Swank directed by Nolan...How can it ever go wrong?</p></br></body></html>

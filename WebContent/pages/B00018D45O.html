I for one find this to be a cheap pitiful cop out, and just silly. This movie although filmed dark and moody isn't really scary and Leatherface comes off as that weird kid in school who had a lot of acne who just finally snapped. Why filmmakers find the need to remake everything these days is beyond me, but this one was really unnecessary, the updating doesn't really help this time around. Maybe Leatherface was just crazy, why can't these villians just be sick in the head without the new personal self image troubles, c'mon people save that crap for the next Hilary Duff movie. Tobe Hooper this movie is an insult to what you created and I apologize for having even seen it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCPMT1RRS7K0.html">A1VCPMT1RRS7K0</a><br/><p>The movie is well-made, especially with the relatively low budget utilized in making it - but I feel it falls short creatively.  The original was gritty and real - this was not.  This movie had a Hollywood feel to me.  I will stop the comparisons to the original movie, as they are in two completely different leagues.<br /><br />This movie just wasn't scary.  It wasn't disturbing or unsettling.  The only thing they were able to maintain throughout was a feeling of mild suspense.  There was just enough gore to keep fans of the genre happy - and it was well done - not too much, not too little.  I was hoping to be disturbed after seeing it, yet I was let down substantially.<br /><br />The bonus DVD and materials, however, are quite impressive.  There is a lengthy documentary on the making of the movie, deleted scenes and even a documentary on Ed Gein, the psychopathic killer the original movie was loosely based on.  The bonus material is actually more entertaining than the film.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you'll have to watch this movie - but don't expect the raw terror of the first movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>Tobe Hooper's original 1974 "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is one of greatest splatter flicks of all time, a landmark in brutal, uncompromising cinema.<br /><br />So why remake it? What else is there to say?<br /><br />First-time director Marcus Nispel (who had previously done nothing but music videos)answer that question in his sledgehammer remake, and the answer to the question is: Oh, old hoss---there's always plenty to say about primal fear.<br /><br />The subject is Fear. Fear, not just of death, but what comes before, and perhaps a little after.<br /><br />We've all been caught out on some lonesome highway after dark, trying to peer up over the high beams at the unfamiliar road up ahead, desperate for a place to pull over for the night, disappointed when the green relflectorized sign drawing up from the dark turns out to be a mile marker and not an advance beacon for the next town.<br /><br />You're afraid of drifting off the road; you're afraid you should have pulled over at that truck-stop 100 miles back and gotten some coffee. You're afraid of all that dark piled up outside the windshield if you're alone, and if you're not, then you're afraid of the horrors that could swoop down on your sweetie, sleeping comfortably in back, if something happens to you.<br /><br />Then you see the red & blue flashers in your rear-view. How could you miss 'em, since the trooper has what must be 30 krieg lights also trained on your head. Is there any Bad Feeling in the world so convulsively bad as being pulled over, out of the blue, by a nameless trooper on a nameless stretch of forlorn roadway at a nameless hour?<br /><br />Especially when, after you've fumbled over your license & registration, said trooper says, in an inflectionless monotone, "could you step out of the car, please?". As if it's an invitation.<br /><br />That is Fear, is it not? You're told to get out of the car by an AUTHORITY: normally you'd be ready to kill---we're wired that way---but what if this guy is legit? Then aren't you the bad guy?<br /><br />Nispel takes that concept and nails it like a champ in his "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", less a 'remake' than a variation on the good old bloody theme. Who knew a whiskey-drenched, speech-slurring redneck sheriff (R. Lee Ermey, who owns the flick right down to his ugly black sock garters) could be more frightening than a chainsaw-wielding monster(Andy Bryniarski, hulking and menacing very nicely, thank you) who wears the skinned faces of his victims?<br /><br />Now, all the original ingredients in this Texas BBQ (extra bloody!--erm, hearty!) recipe are still there, even John Larroquette's solemn voice-over, which still gives me laughing spasms every time I hear it.<br /><br />You've got five teenagers (Jessica Biel and Ericha Leerhsen provide the ogle factor, while Mike Vogel does all the heavy lifting and the other two guys are white noise) crammed in a van on a roadtrip through 1970's Southeast Texas, five teenagers bearing gifts of frankincense, Lynyrd Skynyrd tickets, and pot. Yeah, they're heading north to the Skynyrd concert, ya know man, having scored a little sweet Mary Jane down Mexico way.<br /><br />Which means a quick stop for Texas BBQ and some gas is fraught with more than a little anxiety, and a little becomes a lot when the Kids meet up with a pretty, distraught young hitchhiker (Lauren German), who gives a whole new meaning to "concealed weapon". Soon the Kids needs help from the Locals, and the Locals---well, you know, they need help from the Kids too, so to speak.<br /><br />That's about all you need to know. If you haven't seen either film, I envy you; if you've seen the Hooper classic, then you're in for a few nasty surprises. Nispell keeps the pacing taut, and stables TCM with some remarkably solid actors. Ermey (Sheriff Hoyt) can act in his sleep, but here he achieves a remarkable transformation: keep a close eye on his facial mannerisms.<br /><br />Mike Vogel (Andy)is equally remarkable here: it's rare that I pay attention to victims (I'm rooting for the dude with the Chainsaw, myself), but he does a brand of scared sh*tless I haven't seen before. Impressive, Vogel---very impressive. Leatherface Bryniarski doesn't disgrace the blade: the "custom" face was a sick little touch (you'll know it when you see it).<br /><br />And then, of course, we have the townies: Terrence Evans (Old Monty)serves up a nice turn on the wheelchair-guy motif of the original (brrrr); Heather Kafka (Henrietta) goes from reticent to psycho in less time than you can say "Armadillo!"; and Kathy Lamkin (Tea Lady, and a stand-in for Fat Mama from "Gilbert Grape"), who goes "my my my my my" and gives me the crawls. Yeesh.<br /><br />Nispel's cinematography (vet Daniel Pearl wields the camera) lacks the raw, grainy, documentary flavor of the original (that was called *no* budget), but manages to look both sleek and dangerous. Best of all are the locations, which are even more forlorn than those in the original Massacre. All convey isolation, degeneracy, rot: an entire region whose livelihood, and morality, have long ago gone to seed.<br /><br />Jim Morrison once said, "Out here on the Perimeter there are no Stars". The Perimeter the Old Dead Lizard King was referring to wasn't the Frontier---I think it was the Forgotten. The Land that has been drained and bypassed. Out here, city boy, we have our own ways, and our ways ain't your ways. Out here, we just might bury strangers.<br /><br />Out here on the Perimeter, "civilized" means something else: maybe it means giving strangers a wide berth. Or maybe it means teeth and flesh and blood and the whine of a chainsaw in the dark.<br /><br />Eat up.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A37ZOGOK3GKF2P.html">A37ZOGOK3GKF2P</a><br/><p>After some disappointing sequels, I really thought it took a lot of nerve to even attempt a remake.  I remember Gus Van Sants lame shot by shot remake of "Psycho," and I was certain this was doomed from the beginning.  Instead I was pleasantly suprised by the pacing, script, and the way the film was shot.  It felt 1970 and looked 1970.  The thrills were aplenty.  The gore was splashy and the whole tone of the film was dark and urgent.  I cared about this young group, and wanted them to survive.  They weren't stupid kids high on drugs looking to get laid.  They seemed genuine and like the kids you see everyday.  These good kids were put through a living hell.  A cast of strange villains and one mean muther with a chainsaw gave me a few goosebumps. This DVD is loaded with extras, but one cool feature is the packaging folds out into a chainsaw.  A good time horror movie that stands out on its own.  Well worth visiting 'Texas' over and over.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTSOBAPOWT3.html">A1ZTSOBAPOWT3</a><br/><p>There's nothing special about this remake. &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; has all the right ingredients for a successful horror picture, but it blows it in the end. In the early 1070's, a group of young adults (including Jessica Biel) drive in the middle of nowhere. Then they almost run over a corpse walking on the road. The girl is mortified because 'they' tortured her. Ok, bam, she's done. The kids flip out and try to find a phone, but of course they're in the middle of nowhere and a big, ol' house is conveniently right there screaming, &quot;come in and die!&quot; Typically, the children walk into the house and all hell breaks loose. Leatherface's dungeon is leaking, that boy needs to have that fixed. Then a crooked sherriff (R. Lee Ermey, who doesn't belong in this movie) appears and wraps up the body and calls it a day. You know the kids get it one by one and Leatherface actually reveals his real face. Disappointing. The guy is a big oaf and he trips all over himself while chasing these poor kids. What a goof! The inept creature cut his own leg with that chainsaw. He should've known it wasn't a toy! Then there's this kid with really fake, buck teeth. Why was he in this movie? There was no point for a lot of the 'family' members and they weren't nearly as sadistic as the original family in the 1974 classic. A plus to this movie and I have to quote from the Amazon.com review: &quot;The camera lovingly photographs Biel's tank-topped bosom and sculpted abs as she's running in terror from a bloated, chainsaw-wielding, human-skin-wearing maniac.&quot; Even Richard Roeper pointed that out and gave the movie thumbs up. I remember other scenes where the girls are lying in the dirt, face first and they're coughing a lot because dirt was getting in their mouths. I thought that was funny! This movie had more laughs than scares and the ending was ridiculous. All and all, the movie will satisfy most horror movie buffs, but not highly intellectual people.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>Who doesn't like to see the odd horror film now and again?  I particularly like to if they are done right.  TCM 2003 has done that!  It is so much better than the original, but to be fair, it isn't really a remake.  It is quite different from the original, but that is a very good thing!  Where the original was extremely slow moving and about 40% scary, the 2003 film creates a totally different atmosphere. It is very eeery from the word go.  To top it off, the redneck hillbillies are much more scarier, as are the corrupt police.<p>I was reluctant at first to see this film because I found the orginal so overhyped and boring - but this film is in a class of its own in the horror genre.  Excellent effort by all concerned.<p>Highly recommended to all horror fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>I've seen every single "TCM" movie and I own every single one except this one but I saw this in the theatre and this was awesome.Now unlike "Psycho" the film isn't the same as the original with only little resemblance.The characters Erin,Kemper,<br />Morgan,Aaron,and Pepper are driving through Texas with a pinata full of weed and they pick up a shell shocked hitchiker instead of a freaky guy with knife.She warns them not to go any farther before pulling a gun out and shooting herself point blank in the head.They freak out and pull into a gas station where they meet an old woman who tells them the Sheriff played rather hilariously by R.Lee Ermey will meet them at an old mill.Now the story begins its resemblance with Erin and Kemper going to an old house where they meet an old legless man who allows Erin to use the phone and that is where we see the first glimpse of Leatherface.I can see where a lot of people didn't like this film but in my oppinion it was a good movie and was truly deeply haunting.The film has some of the goriest scenes in recent movie<br />history and Leatherface hasn't looked that cool since Gunnar Hansen portrayed him in the original.If you are a horror fan you need to buy this movie plain and simple,get it. A-</p></br><a href="../users/A120GIT50UISJP.html">A120GIT50UISJP</a><br/><p>The remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre takes us back to the 1970s, shot with a nostalgia for the indie look of the original, and filled with 70s references to drugs, sex, and rock 'n' roll. Five friends are driving across Texas, on their way to a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert when they meet up with a hitchhiker, a young woman who appears drugged or in shock. Minutes after getting into their car, she becomes hysterical, screaming, pleading with them not to take her back. Then she shoots herself in the head. The group tries to do the right thing, calling the sheriff to report the suicide, but in doing so, they unleash upon themselves the insane wrath of the Hewitt family. The Hewitts eat humans, turning them into some mighty fine Texas barbeque.<br /><br />Unlike the original, which shocked audiences with sudden, crude killings, the remake follows a more standard horror formula. The friends are killed off one by one, with plenty of anticipatory jump scenes and soundtrack build-up. We know when the killings will occur, and we know how they'll occur--Leatherface [Andrew Bryniarski] is back for this version. A hulk of a man who wears a mask of human skin, Leatherman wields a chainsaw and is the chief fleshwinner of the family. In this version, however, they give Leatherface a backstory, instead of leaving him an enigma. He wears the mask to hide a severe deformity, a skin condition that has eaten away at his features since he was a small boy. The fact that he chainsaws people into bite-sized pieces, however, isn't part of his trauma; that's just the family business being handed down from generation to generation.<br /><br />The whole town is ruled by Sheriff Hewitt [R. Lee Ermey]. In the original, escape seemed impossible, as all who might be a source of help are part of the conspiracy. In this version, however, there is help, in the form of a little boy named Jedediah [David Dorfman]. He's a Hewitt, too, but he's the family black sheep, having no taste for killing. With his assistance, the group (what's left of them) stand a slim chance of survival. But this family is more cunning than the original family, the characters more functional in their insanity; in the original, the family was so demented as to seem almost cartoonish. Here, they are much more capable and thus more sinister.<br /><br />Although the remake of Texas Chainsaw holds to the basic plot of the original, there are enough changes that the film has a very different feel. Add to that the fact that they use more mainstream horror conventions of foreshadowing and anticipating imminent scares, and the result is much more Hollywood than grindhouse. Which film you prefer probably depends on which tradition you prefer. If you're a grindhouse fan, the new version will seem too clean and tame; if you find grindhouse to be unnecessarily over-the-top and exploitative, you may find this version more to your liking. Take your pick.</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Jessica Biel, R.

Produced by Michael Bay and starring Jessica Biel, the film is about a group of young people who come across an abandoned house in the backroads of Texas. What happens to them is unimaginable and the horror and fear they go through is something that has never been put on film before. This remake is based on the classsic 1974 horror film. However this remake outshines the original because of the outstanding production values and amazing performances by the leads. R. Lee Ermey steals the film as a so-called sherrif who inflicts tortue and hell on the innocent youngsters.<br /> This DVD two disc set is breathtaking as the studio painstakingly took the time in producing it. The DVD set opens up like a mini chainsaw and there is an actual tin card featuring the movie poster art. The bonuses are endless with interviews, commentaries, deleted scenes, and trailers, plus much more.<br /> "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre-2003" would go on to be a huge boxoffice smash and ultimately more remakes of classic 1970's horror films would be produced.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one bloody movie, I liked this film but I was never a fan of the original one so I was hoping this version would be different and it was. Jessica Biel is pretty good in this, I was expecting her to be horrific but she surprised me, she didn't over do it. The ending is too much but the first hour is the most intriguing. This film is gruesome so be forwarned if you are not into all the blood and guts.</p></br><a href="../users/A5X1B2HBQUR3P.html">A5X1B2HBQUR3P</a><br/><p>A movie with realistic gore. The movie is crticized for sadistic gore, but its unfair to judge the movie as a censor or non approver of the genre. To rate a movie you must first enjoy the genre. You see sick horror is not everyone's cup of tea and for the people who do enjoy it, it is not a reflection of a freak sadistic nature of theirs. Its just that such movies peek our human curiosities. Its just a dare thing. Can we stand through this sick blood fest. It's also to explore the sick depravity of human nature. Such movies just tap into our curious voyeuristic tendencies to see to what extent evil intents can hurt and kill others. In that we are just trying to do a reality check and want to get offended and turn away from the sick gore but then again we turn back and complete the movie and only to test our limits. All the gore elements are present and the gore is very realistically portrayed. A remake of the cult classic, leather face and his abnoxious family. Normal formula - 5 guys, of which 2 couples and 1 single guy, on successful pot purchase trip from Mexico land themselves in a middle of nowhere rural area of texas where they invite them selves to trouble and do all the cliched wrong things that you are not supposed to do in a horror movie and land up going deeper into their own torturous deathly ends. You know its a cliche film but hey if you want to watch this movie you are already a  fan of the original and you are watching it to revisit old terrain and for just getting the kicks. So go enjoy and have a bloody good time. It does not pretend to be anything its not. Its not an academy award movie. But having said that all the actors do a pretty good job of making us believe that they are getting ripped apart my chainsaws with their shrieks and ghostly freaked out frightened actin. And as a bonus the lead female character is damn attractive with a good gym body and through the movie we are given a good indication of her ample and healthy figure. Great bloody slasher fest.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>Slick, watchable fun... perfect for when you don't want to slog through a complicated plot but just want some scary scenes and gruesome villains.  The opening and closing sequences, which make the movie feel like one of those "true crime" shows that endlessly play on the A&E channel, are also effective.<br /><br />But it's probably the gore you'll remember most about this.  The other reviewers are right: whatever your opinion regarding how this movie compares to the original artistically and creatively, this remake is inarguably MUCH gorier than its predecessor.  Having said that, however, I still think the film pulls its punches on a few occasions, probably to secure its "R" rating and avoid the dreaded, unmarketable "NC-17".  If you think today's horror movies rely too much on gore, you'll likely appreciate the occasional restraint here.  Myself, I think if you're paying to see a movie called "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", you know what you're signing on for and don't need to be protected.  But I have to admit that, even with the filmmakers' occasional squeamishness, this certainly is no Disney movie and, as a whole, it does deliver the goods.<br /><br />And having Jessica Biel running around in it ain't bad, either.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>When you talk about the TV shows Desperate Housewives, 7th Heaven, CSI, The OC and even The Guiding Light wouldn't you think it strange to mention The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in the same breath? Similarly, when you say R. Lee Ermey you're usually not talking about 2003 and 2006's Texas Chainsaw Massacre films, right?<br /><br />The main actors in both The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beinning (2006) were plucked right out TV. And R. Lee Ermey?...He starred in both Texas 2003 and 2006, but we all know what we really associate that guy with...the colorful Full Metal Jacket (1987) boot camp sergeant, of course.<br /><br />Ah, and let's not forget the up and coming Jessica Beil (2006's The Illusionist); while the 2003 remake of Texas Chainsaw was one of her first big screen films, I expect that we'll see a lot more leading roles from this fine young talent in the future.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to find a very inexpensive 2 pack on sale at Amazon for the price that just one of the disks is selling for today. Unfortunately, as of this writing I see that Amazon isn't offering the same deal, but the two pack is still available.<br /><br />Enough trivia. About the movies.<br /><br />Might as well start at The Beginning (2006). The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning was perhaps one of the top 5 most shockingly brutal movies that I have ever seen. Torture. Brutal murder. Intense violence. All acted out superbly by a cast that mostly made you believe that this horrible stuff was happening.<br /><br />The Beginning was directed by short-resumed Horror vet Jonathan Liebesman, and he mostly kept it real. He made his actors take their rolls seriously, unlike so many Horror movies that throw in teenage camp to dumb down the shock. Liebsman had only a few "oh c'mon that would never happen" scenes versus almost an "oh my God" ever 5 minutes throughout the 96 minute Horror gala (that's like 25 'oh-my-Gods').<br /><br />The over the top and stretch the imagination scenes are enough to bring the film down a notch, but I was out of breath after exposure to so much shock and awe by the time the credits rolled. So The Beginning was affectively above average.<br /><br />The thing about The Beginning is that you know it's not the end. No happy ending expectations here; just a sense of dread for all who come in contact with Sheriff Hoyt's family of degenerates. The Beginning is the prequel that plays right into The Texas Chainsaw 2003 remake of the original 1974 Tobe Hooper cult classic that shocked the nation. Hooper had oversight as a producer in both Texas 2003 and 2006.<br /><br />2003's remake was probably about 1/2 as brutal as the 2006 (unrated version) story of The Beginning, so that should speak volumes as to how to set your expectations. Texas 2003 continues the murderous story of the unfortunate that ventured to close to Sheriff Hoyt's jurisdiction.<br /><br />Shock and awe (or should I say shock and gore) should not be confused with greatness. Both Texas 2003 and 2006 were good Horror movies. They were better gross-out movies. So all in all, if you're into Horror, these moves do indeed epitomize the genre. They are good...not great. If you are rating these on shock these two are at the top of the list.

From the fresh new faces, to the much scarier, bloodier, and all this with a much better quality of picture, sound, better director..everything is just better across the board.<br /><br />One example is how the film opens.In the original, they pick up a hitch hiker, and he is part of the family..He cuts his hand, they freak out, and kick him out of the van.<br /><br />The remake, they are also in a van, they almost run over a girl in the road who has escaped from the hell house, they pick her up, she blows her brains out in thier van,(This is gross) they go find the sherriff, and the horror begins.<br /><br />The second scenario is MUCH scarier to me, than a crazy just cutting his hand, and on and on it goes...<br /><br />The whole film is scarier, and has a more menacing feel to it, and thats a GOOD thing if you are a fan of hard core horror.<br /><br />I have only one complaint , that at the end of the movie, Erin rescues the baby, and NOT the little monkey boy who helps them escape.<br /><br />If you have never seen the remake version, DO see it,  I guarantee you will be more scared :)</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>Having seen the 1974 original, I looked forward to seeing this re-make. The original had a quasi-documentary feel to it with its grainy footage and cast of virtual unknowns. The film was a visual cornucopia of terror and horror, though there was actually very little gore shown on screen. The unusually macabre sets and the relentless sound of the chainsaw bandied by Leatherface were enough to make the viewer tremble.<br /><br />This re-make has stuck relatively close to the original in terms of a general story line, though there are, of course, some differences. In the re-make, a group of teens set off in their van on their way to a concert in Texas, where they end up in a rural area. After picking up a dazed, female hitchhiker, their world is turned upside down when she does the unspeakable.<br /><br />They go looking for help and, unfortunately, come across a house inhabited by one heck of a family of crazies. From the moment they do so, the teens run hither and dither, as they are chased by a chainsaw wielding, leather faced maniac. Unlike the original, this film is a real slasher type horror film with plenty of blood and gore. This is the real difference between the original and the re-make.<br /><br />While the re-make has much better production values than the original, as well as better acting by its cast, the original was far scarier. The director of the original, Tobe Hooper, did far more with far less. Still, if you are a fan of bloody slasher films, this is worth a rental. Better yet, rent both the original 1974 version, as well as this re-make, and then judge for yourself as to which is the superior horror flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>On august 18th 1973, a group of young adults are traveling on a summer drive in Texas picking up a hithchiker who just commited suicide in their van, they decide to seek help at a old farmhouse.

Marcus Nispel delivers a clever, crisp, gritty as well as very scary reinterpretation of Hooper's 74 fright fest.  What makes this film equally as impressive is the on-spot acting of the cast, most of them unknowns besides Biel, Ermey and Balfour.  This film version still takes place in 73, still involves a group of teens, this time on their way to a Lynard Skynard concert, and they still pick up a hitchhiker that ends up leading them to their doom.  This time though they pick up a different kind of hitchhiker, and to me at least, it adds quite a bit to the intensity of the film.<br /><br />Nispel's version leaves all the macabre of the original behind but instead paints a much darker and grim picture.  Yes, the sheriff played by vet R. Lee Ermey is funny in a sick and twisted way, but even he leans more on the sick and twisted then down right funny.  This film paints the screen black from the beginning and does let up.  I feel that makes this a admirable adaptation because, instead of creating an exact replica it creates something new and fresh, and with all the potential horror films that fall short of expectations, this is a breath of fresh air, to actually get nervous instead of anxious.  Every shot can evoke a form of fear, the whole film carrying a feeling of claustrophobia and constant panic, lacing each frame with dim lighting and random shots of dismembered doll parts and animal carcasses, human and or animal bones and abandoned vehicles, all creating a constant sense of dread and misery.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, the acting is really spot-on.  A few scenes of over acting, but that's normal.  Biel really blew me away with her acting, but it was Ermey that stole the whole show.  He was brilliant as the sadistic cop who was even more terrifying than Leatherface.  I personally feel this to be a great compliment to the original, and whether you feel this is a better film or it pales in comparison, the best way to look at this is as a different film, that way you can enjoy them both as the masterpieces that they truly are.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FUBUJAIGM87T.html">A3FUBUJAIGM87T</a><br/><p>When my brother and I saw the previews for the remake of the 1974 seminal horror movie called "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", I just could not wait to see it on the big screen.  After having seen the original "TCM", my now ex-wife refused to go with me to see the remake.  However, had she gone, she would not have hoped to see less of the madness and the macabre that she would have seen that day especially when compared to the original classic.<br /><br />First, it should be noted that the original is indeed much scarier, much better, much more powerful and intense and a much more effective overall horror movie than the remake.  In fact, the old "TCM" still ranks as one of the very best horror movies ever made.<br /><br />That said, "2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is a fairly solid horror movie through and through...I give this movie a solid 3 STARS and that is excellent from me, especially considering today's garbage that has been consistently pumped out of Hollywood over the last 10-15 years.  Of course, the remake is not without warts, not the least of which is that ridiculously absurd seen where the Jessica Biehl's character, Erin, (forgettable character) chops off Leatherface's arm with relative ease. I can't stop laughing every time I see that ridiculous scene...it's pathetic!<br /><br />As far as the story goes, the remake of "TCM" starts out much the same way as the old "TCM".  Those in the audience who have actually seen the original "TCM" become quickly aware of the absence of the terrific character of "Franklin", the invalid brother of Sally in the original "TCM".  I think that the absence of "Franklin" from the remake hurt this movie's effectiveness because Franklin was the most interesting and dynamic character of the young people that are introduced to the audience at the beginning of the original "TCM".  In a sense, Franklin's character and his personality sets a morbid and ghastly tone for what the audience is in for in the original and this theme is sorely lacking in the remake.  Also lacking in the remake is the terrifying score of the original that was so effective in establishing the deathly mood of the original classic.<br /><br />Unlike the original, the remake relies on this young crowd of "wild" twenty-somethings and the audience discovers quickly that Erin is the moral protagonist of the story.  The movie moves along to a scene where a strange girl is picked up by our young unsuspecting young people...this girl is very strange indeed as it becomes obvious to the audience that this girl has suffered some extreme emotional trauma.  What happens next is somewhat predictable yet very disturbing as the girl commits suicide in the van...the young people are naturally very upset and Erin demands that they contact the police.  Hence, the plot is set into motion.  At this point, it becomes clear that the remake is attempting to deviate from the original classic at least to some degree, although such deviation is not near as effective as the hitchhiker scene in the orginal classic which is far more harrowing than the hitchhiker in the remake.  What is perhaps most obvious about this movie is the fact that the original "TCM" feel or atmosphere is completely absent in the remake, and this is not a good thing either.<br /><br />However, as the plot develops, the sheriff, who actually comes to the help of our hopelessly lost 20-somethings, is not your everyday law man and, in fact, it becomes apparent that this man is actually quite dangerous and very disgusting in his manner.  Meanwhile, Erin and Kemper have gone for help elsewhere and visit a house where a very dangerous presence awaits them.  In their attempt to use the phone, Kemper and Erin are confronted by a very abrasive man in a wheelchair, who is noticeably absent in the original.<br /><br />Basically, Erin and her friends are being tricked into a situation of madness and macabre the likes of which they have never nor wanted to witness.  Leatherface and a crazy family of evil scum attacks Erin and her friends and what was a joyful ride to see a "Lynard Skynard" concert becomes a deadly fight for survival against an unremorseful and downright disgusting enemy who wants these young people for their very flesh.<br /><br />The remake of "TCM" provides the audience with a lot more gore than the original, but does that make it better?  Absolutely not, the original "TCM" had the intrinsic morbid and dark atmosphere with an underlying sense of evil and madness that the new "TCM" of 2003 does not even come close to attaining.  Sure, the gore is effective and the villains including "Leatherface" are quite terrifying in their own right with their violent manner and appearance.  However, the absence of the hitchhiker and the cook is clearly a minus for the remake as these were essential characters in the original classic.  Their absence in the remake hurts this movie significantly.<br /><br />The potential to create terror in the audience is there in the remake, at least at times; and, at times, this movie is very effective in doing that, but the lack of the morbid, dark and macabre-like atmosphere so evident in the original but so lacking in the remake hurts the new "TCM" and represents the tremendous difference between the two movies.  The acting in the original is essential to creating the TCM-feel or atmosphere which is missing in the remake, although the acting in the remake is adequate, and the actor who played "the sheriff" does an outstanding job in his role notwithstanding the character's intrinsic inferiority to the original's "the cook" who most closely resembles "the sheriff" although the characters are definitely different but from the same mold.<br /><br />However, in my opinion, the acting is actually better in the original "TCM" because the acting is essential to the atmosphere that Tobe Hooper creates in the original, and the villains in the original are absolutely terrifying in their: ghastly, maddening, disgusting, cold-blooded and evil nature.  The acting in the remake, as I said above, is adequate and at times good, but it fails to set the tone in the remake like the acting was able to do in the original classic, and I think this is a testament to Tobe Hooper's brilliance as a director.<br /><br />There is no question that the villains in the old "TCM" are much more powerful, intense and more naturally horrifying in a very realistic way than the villains in the new "TCM"...hence, this terrifying atmosphere of the old "TCM" is not present in the 2003 version.  Still, the acting and directing of the remake are pretty good overall and the movie is quite entertaining...there are some good death scenes and there is a sense of terror that the audience can relate to in this movie.  After all, what's more terrifying than redneck scum that have absolutely no regard for the sanctity of human life and have every intention of obtaining human flesh for their consumption?<br /><br />Now, as I have indicated above, the only completely stupid scene in the entire "2003 TCM" is when Erin literally chops off Leatherface's arm with a cleaver which is absolutely ridiculous because it would not have been physically possible for her to perform such an act under those circumstances or perhaps any circumstances...that was absurd and brings the movie down.  Also, I thought the movie was a bit anti-climatic.  Last and least of all criticism would be the obvious attempts to focus on Jessica Biehl's attractiveness as a female...that takes away from the purity and effectiveness of the movie itself as a horror movie.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the new "2003 TCM" remake and I recommend it to true horror movie fans as it is a good horror movie which is so much better than most of today's modern trash, but, that being said, I must point out to my fellow horror movie fans and friends, and trust me when I say this and that is, "there is nothing like the original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and this remake is a far cry from the horror, madness and macabre that the audience experiences after watching the original classic called "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre".  Inevitably, casual horror movie fans (especially those who have seen the remake before seeing the original) will unfortunately like the remake better, and this is a tragedy, but all I can do is try and educate those prospective viewers and lead them in the right direction (with this comparative review of the remake to the original classic "TCM") which is most definitely to the nearest DVD store to pick up the original classic and watch it several times before even looking at the remake.</p></br><a href="../users/A331OF34UX4Y1K.html">A331OF34UX4Y1K</a><br/><p>OF course, you must at least enjoy the horror genre a little bit to watch a movie like this. Otherwise, it is pointless to review it. Any horror movie will be a zero star movie if you don't liek the genre.<br /><br />Since I moderately enjoy the genre, I'm apt to give my review. This is another mess suffering from this plague that is video / commercial directors debuting in movies. Produced by Michael "Gloss" Bay, this movie is intended to shock, make you tremble, make you feel disgusting. And it manages to do so, but achieving something of a miracle for this sort of movie: in just thirty minutes into it, you will find yourself CARING for the characters - future victims! I felt myself really annoyed and sad when each of the kis were murdered by that crazy killer, I loathed each one of members of his family, I felt a genuine pleasure when our girl run over the bad sheriff, with a car, three times!!<br /><br />But, at the same time, I shivered while I realized how this is an ugly, atrocious movie. The movie puts you down, there are none of the usual jokes you find in these movies. It's utter bloody, serious and without hope for the characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KDGSZEJXSE9S.html">A1KDGSZEJXSE9S</a><br/><p>Tobe Hoopers 1974 Texas Chainsaw Massacre was one of the<br /><br />best horror films ever made. So what about this 2003 re-<br /><br />make? Well, It has it's good and it's bad... It starts<br /><br />out with 5 teens going to a Skynard concert. Problem is<br /><br />I highly doubt Jessica Biel has any Skynard in her coll-<br /><br />ection so it makes that part alittle hard to believe. But<br /><br />then the teens pickup a chick that is seemingly in shock.<br /><br />Things start to heat up when she seems them going toward<br /><br />the same place she was just coming from.. She grows really<br /><br />upsetand warns the teens of the danger ahead before putting<br /><br />a gun in her month and blowing her brains out. You would<br /><br />start to think that the teens would be wary of going any<br /><br />further but they continue on path until they reach a Bar-<br /><br />B-Q/Gas Station. They are then told they must go out in<br /><br />the countryside to make the report of the girl who commited<br /><br />suicide.<br /><br />This is where it all starts... We are lead to about an hour<br /><br />of grewsome murders and sickening personalities by the likes<br /><br />of a old man and a redneck cop(played by the Full Metal<br /><br />Jacket drill Sergeant)and of course Leatherface. What makes<br /><br />this film good is that the teens in this movie are better<br /><br />actors in the original with the exception of the lead female<br /><br />in the 1974 movie.<br /><br />We also get more gore than the original. That can be good<br /><br />some and bad.... The original wasn't just about murder, it<br /><br />was also about mental torture. This film doesn't have that<br /><br />going for it... In fact, Jessica Biel doesn't seem like all<br /><br />that much of a victim. It seems like despite the presence<br /><br />of Leatherface and the cop that she is still in control.<br /><br />What's good about the film is some good gore the movie<br /><br />gives you a chance to actually care for the victims in-<br /><br />stead of caring less. And as I said, it has better over<br /><br />all acting than the original... It's just ashame that<br /><br />the mental torture part of the movie was non existant.<br /><br />One major complaint... The movie had no special features<br /><br />at all. Come on, they can give us alittle more than a few<br /><br />repetitive trailers.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Yes, some things ARE worse than death. Hammers are worse. Meat-hooks are far worse. The roar of a lunatic's trusty chainsaw is worse still. THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is a dark, deeply disturbed and dripping story of mindless torture, murder, and small town family life (in hell). Jessica Biel leads a hippy-van full of young folks into this twisted day / nightmare of unearthly sadism. Five innocent (well, ok, they are smuggling two lbs. of pot from mexico) kids on their way to see Lynyrd Skynyrd in Dallas are driving along, minding their own business, when they come across a girl wandering down the middle of the road. They simply must pick her up, so off they go, unaware that their plans are about to be changed drastically. The girl is dazed and traumatized, mumbling incoherently about death and doom. Do our five heroes listen to her warnings? Nah, they just figure she's a baked potato on acid. Then comes the first shock of the movie, when the girl pulls out a hidden weapon and turns it on herself. The first shock, but nowhere near the last! Biel and company must find a phone and call the law. Skynyrd will have to wait. Soon, R. Lee Ermy enters the picture as the not-so-helpful, loudly perverse sheriff of the small town. He is obviously dangerous and untrustworthy, with a violent undercurrent just beneath his skin. Little do we know, he is utterly evil to boot! Of course, we have Leatherface as well, that unhinged, misunderstood mountain of murder and mayhem. Oh yeah, and his chainsaw. The last hour of TCM is a relentless assault of carnage and insanity. We are given little context for the events. Like the victims, we get few explanations for the ordeal we find ourselves in. The simple fact is that these kids have stumbled into something they will never escape. Even if they survive physically, some part of them will not make it. Like Hooper's original, this update grabs us and forces us to watch as others suffer and die. It takes us into places we'd rather not imagine and that (we hope) don't exist. Recommended ...</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>Just when you thought the original was disturbing, gross, disgusting, and frightening, now comes the updated version, &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,&quot; which knows no limits when it comes to gore and intensely terrifying moments.  Is it a remake?  Not necessarily.  However, it is more like a movie that pays tribute to a great classic by offering its own vision of a well-known nightmare of limbs and guts.<p>While characters and some of the story has changed, the deranged and murderous plot remains the same.  An unspeakable turn of events (I will not give away how it all starts, as it is very different from the original) lands a group of teens in a nightmarish maze that throws a mutilated man who wields a  giant chainsaw  in their path.  Not to mention the &quot;crazy&quot; family that turns out to be just as vicious and murderous.  For these teens, a safe place is nowhere in their short and painful future.<p>As I said in the beginning, this is not a remake.  Nor is this a sequel.  So what is it?  Well, I like to think of it as an &quot;updated&quot; version of the original--in fact, I consider it more of a tribute to the classic that redefined the horror genera as we know it.  This movie, while much more darker, sinister, and sicker, is not trying to live up to the original, nor is it trying to outdo it.  I had to smile, as this was not a step-by-step remake, such as the newer &quot;Psycho&quot; was.  There are new elements, characters, and plot twists thrown into the mix.  And to be honest... it works.<p>I must confess, I had an unquestionably hard time trying to watch this movie.  There were a bunch of moments that made me want to shut it off, and yet--I continued to watch the debauchery.  There is a sick and twisted fascination that this movie exploits from us, knowing that we're going continue to watch no matter what.  The original was choppy and had a very low-budget, so while it was undeniably violent and brutal it wasn't as hard to take.  This new version is in no way a Grade-B movie.  It's extremely realistic in its absolute brutality.  This shouldn't even be considered as a choice for people who have a hard time watching violence, gore and torture.  This movie takes it to the limit and is unapologetic.<p>Even though this was a hard movie to watch, I have to confess that I liked it.  It is great to finally see a horror movie that isn't overly goofy.  This is a straight-up and serious slasher movie that does what it's supposed to do--TERRIFY US.  An element sadly forgotten by most of the horror flops that come out now.  Maybe they can take a page from this movie and perhaps learn something.  The acting is surprisingly good, the script is quite believable and is rarely cheesy or lame, and the film looks fantastic.  Not a bad job for director Marcus Nispel.<p>This 2-Disc special edition (a single disc version is also available for those who aren't giant fans of the movie) has some tasty extras.  As I said, the film looks and sounds great.  You even have the choice of watching it in DTS if your little heart desires to do so.  Special features include documentaries, deleted scenes, commentary, trailers, TV spots and a whole lot more.  The star of the special features is an exclusive documentary on the notorious killer, Ed Gein, who inspired the original film.  It's a really interesting feature and is the main reason to purchase this edition of the movie.  The behind-the-scenes documentary (over an hour long) is also worth the money, as well.<p>&quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; is an unforgiving bloodbath that sends you to the butcher's with bloody front-row seats.  It's not better than the original, and it is not trying to be.  This film is more of a tribute to an undeniable classic.  It's an entertaining new vision and interpretation of the original.  If you're looking for a straight-up horror movie that isn't trying to be cutesy or is striving for pop status, then this is the one for you.  Just remember one thing... once you open the door, there's no going back.  A disturbing, and yet involving horror film that will stay in your head for days. -Michael Crane</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Well, this 2003 remake of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" creeped me out.  Of course I waited until late at night to watch it, which is what you were supposed to do with a horror movie, because lately even when a horror film has a good start, such as "Jeepers Creepers," they almost always end up being laughable.  Now, I will not go so far as to say this is a great horror film, and I am not suggesting that it replace the raw power of Tobe Hooper's original in any one's mind, but it sure creeped me out more than anything I have seen in a while (except for last month when I watched "The Exorcist" again).<br /><br />What does this remake have working in its favor?  Well, first the film is selective in what it takes from the original.  We have the same beginning with the grainy film and the same narration talking about "one of the most bizarre crimes in the annals of American history" (again narrated by a now considerably more famous John Larroquette), and we have the same basic idea that a group of teenagers in 1973 make the mistake of running into Leatherface and his kin.  But in terms of the specifics the screenplay by Scott Kosar does not treat the original like gospel: the hook is still there, but we lose the bizarre dinner scene where the original really lost me.<br /><br />I was also surprised to see that cinematographer Daniel Pearl is back to show what he has learned since 1974, which is apparently a note.  Maybe the music video sensibilities of director Marcus Nispel have something to do with this at well, but this horror film looks the way that horror films are supposed to look.  You know that things are going well when you are getting the wiggins and the sun has not yet set in the film.  There are plenty of bad things to see in this film, but the camera does not wallow on them the way so many splatter flicks do.<br /><br />Maybe part of the effectiveness of this remake is that for those of us who watched the original we know the basics of what is going to happen so that there is a sense of anticipation that no matter what is happening on screen something really bad is about to happen.  But if I were going to point to something else beyond the cinematography it would be the fact that this time Leatherface (Andrew Bryniarski) is not the really scary one.  No, the honor goes to R. Lee Ermey who brings his drill sergeant from hell to the character of Sheriff Hoyt.  Even before Leatherface shows up these teenagers are in way over their heads.<br /><br />Ripe for the slaughter are good girl Erin (Jessica Biel), her boy friend Kemper (Eric Balfour), young stud Andy (Mike Vogel), the friendly hitchhiker Pepper (Erica Leerhsen), and for comic relief stoner Morgan (Jonathan Tucker).  They are driving through Texas to get to a concert when they almost run over a disoriented and frightened girl walking along the road.  They try to help, but she is beyond help and so, as she plainly tells them, are they.<br /><br />Biel, still trying to put her good girl image from "7th Heaven" behind her, manages to play a scream queen without going off the deep end like she did in "Gear" (even in a freezing meat locker).  Often these films come down to the good girl character trying to survive the maniac with their weapon of choice and in that regard Biel is one of the better to come along.  Yeah, she is smart and sexy, but for once when she gets to the part where she has to fight back you actually believe she might pull it off.<br /><br />This is a grim and relentless film that assaults its audience as much as it does its characters.  After so many horror films that fail on that score perhaps the biggest shock is any film could get this far doing what it is supposed to be doing and if you come here expecting a cathartic ending abandon hope on that score right now.  Also, when you decide to watch it late at night, remember not to turn all the light out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VUP5US1F5HG5.html">A2VUP5US1F5HG5</a><br/><p>A vanload of 70s teens en route to a rock concert stumble upon a depraved backwoods house haunted by a chainsaw-wielding leper with a bad attitude and all hell breaks loose.  Remake of Tobe Hooper's original cult classic and vastly inferior even to that somewhat dubious underground hit.  The atmosphere is admittedly thick with doom and there are shocks and gore aplenty for those who like such things, but characterization, plot, and logic are all sorely lacking.  Jessica Biel is a standout scream queen and R. Lee Ermey chews the scenery with gusto, but there aren't many other good things to say about this nightmarish movie.  Basically just another teenage splatterfest, if neither the best nor the worst in that overdone genre.  A great example of the barbaric nature which dominates modern horror.  Not recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>The remake of the 1974 chiller The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a stylish, atmospheric film, which unfortunately resorts to blood and gore to tell its story. It's a simple story that starts off like any other slasher pic from the 70s and 80s. A carful of sexy teens pick up a hitchhiker, get stranded and become prey to a murderous villain. Unfortunately for the teens in this film (and the original), the villian is not one, but a whole townful of grotesque, psychotic killers. What follows is definitely suspenseful, but uncomfortable to watch and truly hard to sit through. This is one of the most disturbing and violent horror films in recent memory, but did hold my interest because of the great cast and creepy atmosphere. Daniel Pearl, cinematographer for the original 1974 version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, reprised the position for this movie, which I thinl greatly benefited it. However, while the original relied on suspense and a feeling of dread to scare the audience, this film just tries to gross them out. I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised. I just wish it didn't have to be so violent.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ89T42CIUHU.html">ASJ89T42CIUHU</a><br/><p>I have watched several versions of this story and in my opinion the original version is still the best.<p>This modern version is hyped up with sexy teenagers and definitely more obvious gore....like legs getting severed and bodies hung up like meat. Those aspects were also in the original but your mind was what presented the gore more than actual special effects. <p>The actors are all pretty lame, stupid and witless. But who else would stay around in such a crazy town? The "chainsaw" family are all pretty disgusting, inbred and wicked. The scenery is trashy, dirty and littered with pieces of old dead bodies and rusty cars. Of course it is always dark and rainy, a must for bad horror films!<p>The only thing that makes this film at all interesting is the way that the filmakers present clips at the beginning and end leading one to believe this story might actually have taken place in some small creepy town right in our own backyards. That in itself is enough to creep you out.

That a lot of the orignial movie was left out of this newer version.  So what?

All the actors were very good, especially the excellent R.Lee Ermey as the demented sheriff/head of the psycho family,(yes the one and only R.Lee Ermey from Full Metal Jacket fame, but it seems unfair that he is mostly remembered for Kubrick's masterpiece as he has done a large collection of work since).<br />Other actors who impressed me were Six Feet Under's Eric Balfour, and of course Jessica Biel!(she is a Goddess,it is official!!..but seriously she did a very convincing and sexy performance).<br />Now I have to point out a very important matter:<br />You will enjoy this film much more if you do not compare it too much with the original, as some reviewers did, but watch it instead as a 'new' film.<br />Indeed,the two Texas Chainsaw Massacre films are based on the same horrible events that actually happened in Texas's backyard, so in a way it is not a copy or a remake in the proper sense of the word.<br />Besides ,if comparisons are to be made, more recent films are more apt,and one can be made with Wrong Turn which was mediocre at best and not as well directed.<br />Although choosing the same title was a bold move and will inevitably draw much criticism (hence the very low marks from some reviewers) because no matter how good Nispel's version is, no one can possibly recreate the sheer raw and unrelenting power and brutality of the first.But I don't think the filmmaker intended to do that..with a screenplay based on the 1974 one by Kim Henkel and Tobe Hooper, I do believe that they acknowledged the classic status of the original,and I think, it is an indirect tribute to it, not a pretentious and haughty attempt to undermine it.<br />So Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a good film, that delivers good 'ole fashioned edge of your seat-popcorn flying' tension, one that you will enjoy much more if you forget the original for a while,and acknowledge a competent direction and acting.</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>best Horror fim of 2003, very realistic like the origional, great effects, great score, and great acting, but most of all, all the disturbing effects that made the origional so disturbing, are all included plus much more, amazing movie, and from what i hear amazing DVD!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>I watched the original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" back when I was in college and again when this remake was released in the theaters.  I enjoyed it very much, with its camp horror and constant terror throughout.  It was a very good film, but it's young remake is also up to the task.<br /><br />Though most people who've watched the original will probably find more wrong with this film than folks who didn't(think old Star Wars vs. new Star Wars), this new version is actually pretty good.  It has a likeable young cast who do very good jobs with their roles.  Leatherface, Granny, and the rest of the cannibalistic family are fun to watch as well.  Their interactions with each other are morbidly engaging.  R. Lee Ermey is hysterical as the sheriff.<br /><br />The film is very tense, especially when Jessica Biel realizes that her friends are being murdered and she attempts to save the few that remain.  At one point, Ermey's character takes a sick and twisted turn in one of the most tense-filled scenes in the film.  He forces one of Biel's friends to "help" him in the investigation of a suicide by re-enacting it.  Biel does a lot of running and screaming, but it is all very believable and done with good cause(obviously, I'd run too if Leatherface was chasing me).  Also, the camera manages to find Biel's bosom and midriff quite often, especially in close-ups.  We see her running with a dry, tight shirt, a wet shirt(white nonetheless), and a blood-soaked shirt.  It's obvious why we see her in this way, but I'm sure most of the gents in the crowd won't be offended.<br /><br />Overall, I was surprised at how good this film actually was.  I was actually a little tired after the constant, relentless chase scenes in the flick, which means I was really captivated by the action on the screen. It managed to haul me in and keep me interested until the credits rolled.<br /><br />In closing, I highly recommend this remake of a classic.  I do suggest you watch both of them if you haven't, but keep in mind that the original will always be tough to beat.  Give this remake a little breathing room, and you'll quickly find that it is one of the better horror flicks in recent years.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>unnecessary remake of Tobe Hooper's, gritty, documentry, style horror film. This "Texas Chainsaw" is a slicked up, glossed over slasher film that tries to scare, but, I couldn't help but watch and compare it to the original, as the film unspooled before me.  <p>Its the early 70's, in anywhere Texas, USA. On a deserted stretch of road, a van full of kids are headed to see a Sknyrd concert (& hopefully score some reefer on the way), but, get sidetracked when the group picks up a beaten, battered, exhausted, & bloody young girl, staggering on the side of the road, claiming that "he's coming" and she wants to end it all. She does by grabbing one of the kids' pistol and blowing her brains out. Everyone freaks and stops at the nearest store to call for help. The kids get deeper into to trouble, as the lady of the store tells them that the Sheriff will meet them all down the road, in a field not to far from the store. Sad to say, who & what they run into has nothing to do with Law Enforcement.<p>The film has some major problems. <p>One - I did not buy for one second that the film takes place in the 70's. The film is so glossed over that it looks like the film was made by the employees at the local GAP. Also, why is it that every filmmaker has got to have "Sweet Home Alabama" playing on the soundtrack to make a statement that the film is offically in the 70's? Alabama ain't that sweet.<p>Two - These kids are dumber than Gump! They deserve to die! I would have brought the girl's body to the local hospital, no if's, and's, or but's about it (if anyone rejected that idea, I would've tossed'em out of the van). Even if I stopped to call the cops, I wouldn't be going to no field in the middle of East Bum**ck, Texas, no matter what the cops say.<br /><br />Three - The "Blair Witch" documentary style pieces that bookend the film aren't neccessary and look foolish. It comes off like an episode of "In Search Of" without the search.<p>Four - Leatherface. He sucks. Gone is the crazy, running, cannibilistic, squealing, hill-billy mute from Tobe Hooper's nightmare. Here, Leatherface looks like he could easily get sidetracked playing charades rather than chasing young, nubile, females for his supper.<p>I can't stop recommending the original because with that film it had a gritty, dirty, sadistic, scary, 70's documentary feel to it (I still cringe when the kid in the wheelchair gets the chainsaw handshake from old rubberface). As for the remake, watch the original first, this "Chainsaw" runs with the chain off.</p></br><a href="../users/A10HMPPHWI3V0A.html">A10HMPPHWI3V0A</a><br/><p>The theatre which I went to on Halloween Night at about 11pm was 100% completely packed with people of all kinds, some as young as 8 or 9, others in their upper 70's. From the get go of the film when the young woman gets into the car and blows her brain's out, I could tell that everyone was have fun, getting rowdy and even screaming now and then. This remake of Tobe Hooper's classic "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" does what any sequel should do, which is follow the script from the first (Because the first film was most likely very successful or there would be no need for a re-make), Make everything happen that the first one did not deliver TECHNOLOGICALLY (I think everyone would agree that it was pretty cool to watch it in a much better screen definition & lastly to not change the ending ..... Ooooops! yes The remake's ending completely differs from Hoopers Classic (which was 220% better!) so overall all the movie serves the clasic well other than the ending,.....<br /><br />One of the main things other than the change of the ending the ending which I did not like was that they got Jessica Beil to play the lead role (which I must say that I was looking forward to seeing her croak at the end so you can only imagine the utter dissapointment HAHA!) AND that they changed the qualitys othe charactors from the 70's version a bit too much (such as the wheelchaired guy is not in the remake!) I thought that they should have included the crazy man from the original with the shaving knife that kept cutting himself for fun. I also thought that whole entire town in on the killings idea was stupid mostly just because I think it draws away the whole "True Story" statement.<br /><br />What I thought was absolutly brilliant from this film is that they added a villian in this one who was absolutly wand unmistakenly evil - the fake sheriff, he was in my opinion the true villian of the remake instead of Leatherface.<br /><br />Overall I dont think a remake can get much better btu If they would have changed just a few thing especially the ending than the movie could have been REALLY good, but hey I'm not dissapointed and like the reat of the audience that was there watching that night on Halloween, I enjoyed it just like they did!<br /><br />Grade: B</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>While I fully appreciate and respect the tastes of others, let me just say I have no idea why the original is held in such high regard. It was truly one of the worst films I have ever seen. Nothing happened in it. There was ZERO suspense or excitement, the dialogue was barely audible and it felt like another half of it was missing. I hated it and I am so puzzled why so many people love that film. <p>Granted, back in 1973 it may have been easier to scare audiences and the low-budget nature of the original may have contributed to the ugly look of the film but I see no reason to credit the original director (Tobe Hooper) with any of the film's so-called qualities. The man's career fell flat on it's face soon after and I think his most famous movie was something of a fluke. It would not have succeeded today. Obviously, as I just said, audiences today are exposed to a larger number of movies and can choose and discriminate more easily. There are some who will say the only people who can enjoy this will be degenerate teenagers who don't know what real horror is. And some who will call the film to glossy. But none of this I find fair criticism. <p>I am, in no way, a fan of Michael Bay or any of his movies. But he had the right idea in keeping the budget very low for this movie ($8 million) and seems to be more skilled in packaging and producing than directing. The film is not 'glossy' or 'clean'. The equipment use to make the film is more sophisticated than that on the original but this is not 'The Rock' or 'Armageddon' and there are no hundred-shots-in-a-second and flashy camera tricks. They all tried their best to pull of a nervous, raw horror film that stands on it's own and I think they have.<p>This was sooooooo much better than the first. The characters actually HAVE character this time. I got on their side, I got involved in the action (yes, there is action this time, and a LOT of it) and the acting was done well. Plus Jessica Biel is VERY hot. <p>So many new dimensions and situations occur is this remake that elevates to something a zillion times what the original was. Don't automatically think that because Michael Bay is the producer that it's going to be some kind of sanitised and fashion-shoot Hollywood production. It is still a very edgy and intense film. It's rare that a Hollywood film manages to horrify and offend these days, so I'm very glad the new TCM went for a hard R-rating. The tone is so filthy and depraved that you will definitely need to shower soon afterwards. THAT'S how close you get to the action.<p>Even the character of Thomas 'Leatherface' Hewitt has a lot more to do this time. He's not quite Jason Voorhees but he's still an incredibly mean bad guy you'd NEVER want to mess with or come within 10 miles of. And in case you're wondering, he's played by the same dude who played Butterfinger, the big, dumb blonde guy from Hudson Hawk. Only this time he's not so cuddly. <p>Not since 8mm almost 5 years ago have I seen a film where the bad guys (there's more than one) are nothing but the blackest of all evil. R. Lee Ermey was terrific (as usual) as the disgusting Sheriff and any fans of him should only expect the most badass of performances. <p>Second to Dawn of the Dead (and tying with House of 1000 Corpses) this is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time. <p>The Platinum Series DVD is just awesome. The 1.85:1 anamorphic picture is superb and the Dolby 6.1/DTS ES soundtracks are incredible. You'll really think Leatherface is chainsawing his way into YOUR living room. There are also a massive load of interesting extras including a 75-minute documentary, deleted scenes, a documentary on serial killer Ed Gein (who was 'supposedly the inspiration for the original but Tobe Hooper denied these rumors) and screen test footage. The packaging is awesome with a metal plate stuck on the front cover and 'crime scene' photos in a little envelope tucked into back. It completes a great package of a great DVD of a great movie. Buy it!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This was a decent remake.  While it follows the original storyline, it does deviate some and makes some flips to keep things interesting.  It has its moments good and bad, but it is certainly worth a watch.  For gorehounds, it has a fair share of blood, and for others, you have Beil in a wet t-shirt or a truly maniacal over the top performance by the Sarge.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>i saw the 1974 version and i liked it but in soe ways it was kinda... cheesy. i mean the whole dinner scene is nothing more then a prolonged death and with no sense of humor. now the 2003 has redone the film but takes out the cheesyness and just gives you a cold-blooded movie with very little hope. the movie starts out saying about the actual incident and then it goes into the film. five adults are heading to a concert and on there way the pick up a strangler who has experinced something tromatic. after a very tense 2 minutes, she kills herself and the adults are freaking out. they then come to a town that is full of a family of madmen and cannibles. after that the movie takes pace to funny, disturbing, dark, and then picth. this is a way better version then the 1974. see it with no lights but have someone with and rediscover "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZE73RFY0GD3K.html">A2ZE73RFY0GD3K</a><br/><p>I heartily recommend that everyone who even remotely considers relocating to Texas view this documentary before doing so, to be aware of the sorts of folks and situations with which you will routinely have to deal (in addition to all the pollution and absence of a state income tax) -- it will make you completely rethink your plans. If you don't want your life plagued by dull-witted screaming teens, country hick redneck crackers and, of course, chainsaw-weilding homicidal maniacs, then you will want to avoid the Lone Star State completely, and prevent yourself and your family from falling victim to the mayhem here. Oh sure, parts of this documentary were amusing, but the sheer horror overwhelms all of that, every day here. Do yourself a favor and stay away from Texas -- stay alive, stay undismembered, stay sane and, above all, stay safe. You definitely do not want to move here.</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>Before the days of Jason Voorhees, Freddy Kruger, and even Michael Myesr, there was Leatherface and the rest of the HeWitt family. This is a great remake of the original 1974 film of the same name.<br /><br />The film starts out with a group of teenagers traveling through Texas in a van on their way to a Lynard Skynard concert. They pick up a young dazed blonde womkan who obviously needs help. As she rides in the backseat, she puts a .38 special in her mouth and pulls the trigger. This sets off a chain of events that lead them on the path to meet the HeWitt clan.<br /><br />R. Lee Ermey, everybody's favorite Marine Corps drill instructor, plays the insane sheriff who is really part of this cannibalistic clan.<br /><br />Leatherface is huge, mean, and can slice and dice better than ever before. When he doesn't have the chainsaw, he's just as handy with a sledgehammer and a sewing machine.<br /><br />Jessica Biel is our heroine and she looks great, especially towards the end when she is soaking wet and the tank top gets tighter and tighter, she certainly is the eye candy of this flick.<br /><br />Do I like it as much as the original? Yes and no. The original is a classic and I love it, but seeing a reborn Leatherface in the next century brings me a strange sense of peace. If I am not mistaken, and I will have to watch both movies back to back, I think the gas station is the same in both movies. Nice touch.</p></br><a href="../users/AE42JLYPXUI45.html">AE42JLYPXUI45</a><br/><p>In 1974, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE was claimed to be the scariest movie ever made. The film was a huge box office smash, spawning three sequels (THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2, LEATHERFACE: THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE III, & THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE NEXT GENERATION). But in 2003, director Michael Bay gave us this incredible remake: THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.<br /><br />  The movie starts off with some police footage of the crime scene where the massacre took place. Then seen are random bits of evidence such as glasses and paper with writing on it. We then see a police evidence tape that has a walkthrough of the HEWITT home. We see the officer guiding through the stairwell to the basement as he points out some scratches on the wall (which is shown later on in the film). We then see five teens swimming in a river.<br /><br />  The film flashes back to that of August 18, 1973, five college kids, ERIN (played by the sexy Jessica Biel), KEMPER (played by Eric Balfour), PEPPER (played by Erica Leerhson), ANDY (played by Mike Vogel), and MORGAN (played by Jonathan Tucker), are on their way to a LYNRYD SKYNYRD concert in Dallas. The kids are returning from a trip to Mexico, where Kemper, unbeknownst to his girlfriend, Erin, bought marijuana. As they are driving through Travis County, Texas, they see a girl about their age walking nearly in the middle of the road. After nearly hitting her, Erin insists that they pick her up, so they do. She is in some sort of hysterical state and babbles about a "really bad man". The teens take her in their car where she says, "You're all gonna die," before shooting herself in the mouth. The five teenagers are in shock. They find an old gas station and stop there to call the police and report the suicide. The owner of the station calls the sheriff for them, and she tells them that they need to meet him at an old mill called "the old Crawford mill." They drive to the old mill, but find no sheriff. While they are looking around, they find a young boy named JEDIDIAH (played by David Dorfman) living inside the mill. He tells them that the sheriff is probably "at home getting drunk." They ask if they can drive there from the mill, but Jedidiah tells them that the road doesn't go there, and "it's a short walk." Erin and Kemper take off through the woods to find the sheriff's house, leaving the other three teenagers at the mill.<br /><br />Erin and Kemper eventually come to a large gray-brick house in a field. Erin is allowed inside by the owner, an old man in a wheelchair with no legs, but Kemper is told to wait outside. Erin calls the sheriff while Kemper, fed-up with waiting, sneaks inside the house to look for her. While he is snooping around, he gets hit in the back with an axe and dragged into the basement by LEATHERFACE (whose real name is THOMAS BROWN HEWITT) (played by Andrew Bryniarski). Erin leaves without Kemper, who she assumes has already left, and heads back to the old mill. Meanwhile, the sheriff is already at the mill with the other three. He wraps up the body of the dead girl with plastic wrap and has the kids put her in the trunk of his car. Erin eventually makes it back to the mill just as the sheriff is leaving, and discovers that Kemper is not there. She and Andy go back to the house to look for him. Andy sneaks inside while Erin distracts the owner. The old man soon discovers what they are up to, and summons Leatherface, who chases them out of the house with his chainsaw. Erin gets away, but Andy's leg is severed and he is taken inside where he is hung on a meat hook in the basement. Erin arrives back at the mill in a panic where Morgan and Pepper are waiting inside the van. Erin tries starting the van, but it doesn't work. The sheriff soon shows up again, and spots marijuana inside the van. He orders the three out of the van and forces them to the ground. He makes Morgan re-enact the suicide, and then kidnaps him, leaving the girls alone at the mill with the van. Soon Leatherface shows up (wearing Kemper's face) and cuts Pepper in half with the chainsaw. Erin is chased through the woods until she arrives at a small trailer. She takes refuge inside the trailer, where a heavyset woman known as "THE TEA LADY" (played by Kathy Lamkin) and a pale thin woman reside. The skinny woman, who has apparently stolen a baby from a previous victim, gives Erin some drug-laced tea that knocks her out while the Tea Lady looks on. Erin wakes up back inside the Hewitt house. Immediately after she wakes up, she is thrown into the basement by Leatherface. She finds Andy on the hook, and in act of sympathy, kills him with a large knife. She then finds Morgan still alive and they escape from the basement with the help of Jedidiah, who distracts Leatherface long enough for them to find a cellar door that leads outside. With Leatherface chasing them, they find an abandoned house and hide inside. Leatherface finds them, however, and kills Morgan by using his chainsaw to split him in two up the middle. Erin runs out of the house and makes it to barbed wire fence. She crawls through, but Leatherface trips and cuts himself with the chainsaw. Erin continues to run.<br /><br />Erin soon makes it to a large meat factory. She goes inside, grabs a meat cleaver, and hides from Leatherface in a locker. When he comes by the locker she jumps out and severs his arm with the cleaver. She then runs back outside and is picked up by a trucker. She panics when they pass a familiar sign, so the trucker stops at the gas station to get help. While the trucker goes inside, Erin hops out of the truck and peaks through the gas station window. She sees the sheriff and the skinny woman with the stolen baby. The sheriff walks outside, and Erin runs him over with his own car, and then drives away with the baby. As Erin is comforting the child, Leatherface appears in the middle of the road, brandishing his chainsaw in his other arm. He slices the drivers' side door off the car but Erin is unharmed. Leatherface just breathes heavily from the blood loss and stares as the car drives away. The final scene shows the second half of the police tape. This shows the men being attacked by Leatherface in his basement. A few fast-paced shots of him fly by the screen, then we cut to the officers' funerals. We then have a look at the only known image of Leatherface and are informed that "The scene was not properly secured by Travis County Police. Two investigating officers were fatally wounded that day. This is the only known footage we have of Thomas Hewitt, the man they call Leatherface. The case remains open."<br /><br />  Now, the 1974 original film was awesome, horrifying, and very disturbing. But it doesn't even compare to the 2003 remake. This 2003 remake is way scarier, even gorier, and way more disturbing than that of the original 1974 film. This was an awesome remake that deserves 100 stars, not 5.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>I've heard a lot of good buzz about the remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (TCM).  With the prequel out and my wife fiddling with the Netflix queue, the remake was pushed to the top of our list.  And so on a rainy Sunday afternoon, instead of going to a movie, we stayed home and watched Leatherface cut people up.<br /><br />TCM touts itself as being "based on a true story."  That true story is the sick tale of Ed Gein, a serial killer who skinned women and wore their flesh like clothes.  Gein was the inspiration for Psycho as well as Silence of the Lambs.  You'll notice neither of those films claim to be based on true stories, and yet TCM does...even though Gein never used a chainsaw.  Go figure.<br /><br />The original TCM (1974) practically invented the slasher genre, with Halloween (1978) and Friday the 13th (1980) to follow soon after.  Of course, neither Michael Meyers nor Jason Voorhees started out using chainsaws.  That peculiar honor goes to Leatherface, the mute, hulking freak that wears peoples' faces.  And just like that, slasher films would forever be connected with the chainsaw.<br /><br />The remake of TCM follows the standard plot, but tries to provide some logic around the usual band of teenage idiots waiting to be chopped up into bloody gibbets.  Final Girl Erin (Jessica Biel, firmly leaving the 7th Heaven stigma behind her) and her boyfriend Kemper (Eric Balfour) are back from a road trip to Mexico.  Tagging along are Kemper's two friends, nerdy Morgan (Jonathan Tucker) and studly Andy (Mike Vogul). A hot hitchhiker they pick up on the way named Pepper (Erica Leerhsen) rounds out the cast.<br /><br />The film still takes place in the 70s and it shows: the real reason the kids went down to Mexico was to score some marijuana.  The Scooby gang nearly hits a traumatized girl wandering down the road.  When they try to drive her to a hospital, she pulls a gun and shoots herself in the head.  Thus begins the quandary.  As Morgan so eloquently puts it:<br /><br />"Oh, police officers, please, as you inspect a crime scene, which is now our van, please, ignore the colorful pi&ntilde;ata, filled with marijuana, in case you happen to come across it, because it played no part, you know, whatsoever in the demise of this unfortunate, young, woman."<br /><br />Eventually, the teenagers bump into the Hewitt family and things go downhill from there.  It's noteworthy that the horror starts with an authority figure, Sheriff Hoyt, played by the inimitable R. Lee Ermey.  Forget Leatherface...what I find scary is a sheriff/drill sergeant utterly abusing his power and screaming in my face.  Ermey's at his sadistic best here, such that he received a greatly expanded role in the prequel to the remake (confused yet?).<br /><br />Tobe Hooper, the director of the original, made the atmosphere a major character in the original film and remake director Marcus Nispel does not disappoint. Everything is dirty, broken down, bleak, desolate, and most of all hot.  Everyone is covered in sweat and dirt.  Some places drip with water or worse, while others are so dry that every movement kicks up a dust cloud.<br /><br />The cast does a believable job of being scared and stupid. Men who aren't fans of Biel will become fans by the end of the film.  Trust me on this one.<br /><br />The movie even has a bit of foreshadowing in a minor plot element that is never quite fully explored. Jedidiah (David Dorfman from The Ring) is a young, buck-toothed kid that the teens first encounter.  He plays out Leatherface's peculiar form of torture with dolls, strapping them to pieces of wood and displaying them everywhere.  Indeed, it's Jedidiah who helps our Final Girl escape, left to live outside like an animal "until he learns the rules."  Apparently, the rules involve luring teens into Leatherface's den. Why does Jedidiah do this?  My guess is it's because he's jealous of the new baby.<br /><br />That new baby is apparently kidnapped from a previous set of victims.  We can only surmise this, as the film gives us hints as to what might have happened before.  The child's presence changes the tone from a typical slasher flick to a rescue mission of sorts.  Erin doesn't just want to save herself and her friends, but THE CHILDREN!<br /><br />TCM abruptly cuts to a scene in a meatpacking plant that also happens to be the final standoff between Final Girl and Leatherface.  It's a very choppy cut; one moment Erin's running across a highway and the next she's suddenly pursued by Leatherface.  The conflict between them is especially unbelievable (the damage Erin inflicts on Leatherface is patently ridiculous), but the ending is satisfying and clearly establishes the true bad guy as the Sheriff.<br /><br />Overall, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a serviceable slasher flick. Unfortunately, in a world where the slasher is a Hollywood icon, TCM has nothing new to add and thus ends up recycling and dumbing down the tropes it first established.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>Certain things should better be left alone. Like, for example, certain cult movies from the depths of the 70s such as the "Texas chainsaw massacre". Now, those who've seen the original know that it had cultdom written all over it because it had this feel to it as if it was done based on a true story. Kinda like the recent "Blair Witch project" flick but even more so. <p>What the original didn't have was sexy babes runnin about in a hilarious scream-a-thon and a hillbilly family that wasn't scary but resembled rather the equivalent of Married with Children gone South.<p>  But lets get down to the painful details as far as this sorry remake is concerned. It'd be best if i went over a summarised list of the annoyances and nuisances in this movie:<p>- The chainsaw wielding guy is so overused in this movie that in a perverse way it looked as if Black n Decker was doing a very advanced, cutting-edge, long commercial about its new line of products.<br />- Not only was the chainsaw guy overused, but eventually he turns out to be a focal comedy point in the film, as he seems to be a moody fella. First he stashes his soon-to-be-victims away in his cellar (where they can have time to hatch escape plans, and practice some more screaming) and then quite whimsically he remembers that he's got'm all sweaty and waiting down there so he picks up his chainsaw and down he goes chopping up half the staircase in the process. Sounds like a parody? Yes, but the problem is it was not intended to be, or if it was, it stayed a well hidden secret from the movie creators.<p>- The bizzaro-murdero-caniballo hillbilly family is so funny that it adds more howling laughter to be had and spoils whatever dim hopes this film had to be even remotely "scary". I know, it sounds like an intended parody again. Well, as i said above, it wasnt supposed to be.<p>- The good guys, composed obligatorily of 2 categories: the babes, and the hunks, falls into one of the most horrendous cliches of bad horror films. That would be that according to such films the victims are always future catwalk stars. They are also (perhaps again obligatorily) surrealy dumb. Maybe this is supposed to kick some sense of justice into us as they become anatomy experiments by the chainsaw-wielding psycho? I don't know, but i have some notions about that...<p>- The script, is, well, what script? To paraphrase a famous adage, the first casualty of a bad movie is the script. In this one here, the script is given to the chainsaw-psycho for practice BEFORE the movie gets filmed. It's all downhill from there.<p>All in all, as remakes are rapidly becoming Hollywood's way of bailing itself out of a dire need for scripts, we're having a sad phenomenon where perfectly good movies are butchered in the search for mo'bucks. Younger audiences might not be as offended as older ones but the result is nevertheless poor, really poor.<p>Acceptable for a night when you're snowed out and have a serious case of the flu to take care of, otherwise check out the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>If you've never seen the original, than you'll probably love this movie.

Lee Ermey and the woman who plays "Leatherface's" mother, this is a pathetic effort--and done for the sole purpose of exploiting all the young and naive horror fans who don't know better--and who may not even be aware of the 1974 original.<br /><br />The people who made this thing are absolutely souless and have made this for one reason  and ONE REASON ONLY: to fill their pockets--with no regard for what made the original horror masterpiece work.<br /><br />The script is B.S, the direction? Lame. (Pun not intended.) Where is the suspense, Mr. Director? Did you think you were making another laxative commercial? Is that why the entire film feels like a commercial made for morons with a short attention span?<br /><br />The photography (even though it was Pearl, who did the original) is way too slick and makes what should have been grubby and eerie locations,appear fake--as though done on some Holllywood soundstage.<br /><br />So what was the purpose, then?

Can you? It's not rocket science.<br /><br />The music? Way too lush for this film. Orchestral music for TCM? This is nuts. Look at the original! Mostly sound-effects--and NEXT TO NO MUSIC! THE WAY IT SHOULD BE DONE---for TCM!<br /><br />And "Leatherface?" Give me a break.<br /><br />Don't they know there is ONLY ONE GUY WHO CAN PLAY THIS CHARACTER? His name happens to be Gunnar Hansen. Remember the name?<br /><br />Of course, they do--but you see, the Hollywood whores just don't give a damn.<br /><br />It saddens me that this version pulled in 80 million. Because now, they will crank out even more tripe of this nature.<br /><br />I didn't buy this, by the way, a friend shoved it at me, saying he only paid ten bucks for it, used, and that maybe I should take a look, since I respected the original TCM so much.<br /><br />Guess what? I absolutely regret that I wasted time looking at this not-very horrifying and/or convincing "horror" flick. The only solace for me was being made aware of the gorgeous Jessica Biel.<br /><br />Lisa L. as well did what she could with what she had to work with.

It makes for a nice ad campaign, but too many people have no idea what they're talking about.<p>THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and PSYCHO are both based on the same case: Ed Gein, a mild-mannered maniac in Wisconsin who dug up bodies and made skin suits out of them.  He also did some creative things with body parts and his furniture.  They found an old woman hung upside down and draining into a bucket in his barn (while he was having dinner with a family down the road!).  Not in Texas, no superhot girls like Jessica Beil bouncing around in terror, no conspiracy of backroad inbreds.<p>I always liked the original.  Something about the low-budget look gave it a gruesome authenticity.  The claustrophobic madness of that goofy family in the original also really works.<p>This new version doesn't expand on anything from the original and, although slickly produced, it could have been any of the forgettable &quot;sequels&quot; that have come out over the years.  CHAINSAW basically becomes just another slasher flick.  I did like that they got John LaRoquette to do the lead-in narration--as he did in the original, but that's about it.  R. Lee Ermey's always fun.<br />I thought having Jessica Beil dispatch one of her friends since he'd been relieved of a limb was a weird choice (I would've like that character better if he'd wanted to use his final breaths fighting back against the hillbilly cannibals), even as I kept getting hit over the head with a Meat Is Murder subtext.  At least the movie didn't end with &quot;One Tin Soldier&quot; or some lame anti-meat folk song.<p>I wanted to like it, but it's just another modern studio horror movie: no discernible artist voice/value, corporate product, etc.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>Hollywood are obviously running out of ideas for movies at the moment, as there are a lot of remakes appearing, including Starsky &amp; Hutch and this to name but a few. But then again, these remakes will appeal to a whole generation, who haven't seen the originals. I'm not really a 70s horror movie fan to be honest. I saw Halloween and that put me off for life, I have never been so bored during a horror film as I was during that!<p>When I watch horror movies, I'm normally one of those people who jumps the height of themselves (which isn't very high for me), but thankfully, not someone who screams right the way through the movie. This was one horror movie that I didn't do that. Instead, I was sitting there, literally not believing what was happening on screen. Heaven forbid you take your eyes off the screen for a crucial second, cos otherwise, you'll miss something! <p>In some sense, the film is quite formulaic and predictable - it goes over the whole tried &amp; tested bit of separating up the characters before killing them. I'm starting to notice this more and more in films, and it's really beginning to get tedious.<p>Towards the end of the movie, Jessica Biel (Erin) seems to be competing in a wet T-shirt contest all by herself. Definitely aimed at the guys that whole bit, why else would it be in there?<p>This is a great horror flick, if you want a little gore, especially in a suicide scene - there is an absolutely terrific shot, but you'll feel physically sick when you realise what is happening.

I've seen it all, from start to finish, and believe me, Horror - that is to say, true horror, is one of the genres I live for. To feel real fear wrought by filmmakers is one of the pleasures of my life.<br /><br />Up until the year 2000, the original Tobe Hooper version of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' was actually banned here in Ireland - along with 'The Exorcist' and several other seminal classic Horror movies - so, upon its cinematic re-release in those heady days when there was no such thing as a multi-region VCR, I snapped up a ticket and was mesmerised, far more so than I was by 'The Exorcist' (released here around the same time), by the actual fear and sense of melancholic terror it inspired.<br /><br />When I heard they were remaking it, I was duly fearful - for when has a remake ever passed muster with anyone apart from the most superficial of moviegoers? - but when I heard that the new version was going to be a different take on the original, keeping the same basic premise and little else, I relaxed somewhat. At least they weren't going to destroy the Original, rather build a new picture loosely based on the same plotline.<br /><br />There was hope, I thought.<br /><br />Now I see how truly wrong I was.<br /><br />The first and major problem with the new 'Massacre' is that the direction is truly appalling. It is unsuitable, it is disjointed and it does not belong to a movie of this nature. In this day and age where it's nigh-on impossible to scare the moviegoing public anymore, why hack-director Marcus Nispel has merrily employed EVERY SINGLE LAST DIRECTORIAL CLICHE known to man is a question that will forever mystify me. Gratuitous nipple-shot? Check. Token trapped-in-a-closet shot? Several of them. Check. Excessive gore? Check. Bad strobe lighting? Check. Zoom-on-characher's-face-right-before-a-shock? Check. And yet, all of this would be forgivable if only Nispel had actually tried to create some sort of visual charisma with his cameras. Sadly, he has not, and what we are left with is a visual motif which has more in common with an action-blockbuster than it does with an isolated no-way-out horror tale. Extremely ill-fitting, the direction and Nispel himself prove to us all that Hollywood Stereotypes, sadly, must exist for a reason.<br /><br />The cast is, as are most of the casts of contemporary horror movies, totally forgettable. No one performance stands out, nobody has any decent, strong dialogue or developmental scenes, but this is not due to any lack of talent on the cast's part - rather, a thoughtless script that allows no room for the generation of character sympathy. They might well be a bunch of Central Casting Rejects lacking even the briefest of acquaintancships with Acting, but thanks to a lousy script, we just can't tell.<br /><br />Similarly poor is the execution of the 'NEW' ideas and scenes. Sound and all as they are (the inclusion of the Meat factory and extended Leatherface family are both excellent ideas, in theory), because of poor direction, absent characterisation and VERY run-of-the-mill action, they end up as being just another way to fill ten minutes before the obligatory 1.5 hours are up.<br /><br />And sadly, that's the lasting impression left on me by the new version of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. It could have been so good, but principally thanks to talentless direction and bored-looking actors, it never once manages to get off the ground, or hold its own as a Film.<br /><br />And when compared to the original, it's a laughable piece of Nothing.<br /><br />Avoid!! Avoid like the Man with the Chainsaw!</p></br><a href="../users/A1XX5797TIZT5Q.html">A1XX5797TIZT5Q</a><br/><p>I had groaned when I heard that they were going to remake The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  The original Chainsaw was, arguably, one of two horror films (the other being Night of the Living Dead) which had brought the genre into the modern age, making it more brutal, more realistic, and less about fantastical monsters than about horrifying human beings who do exist.  In other words, completing the journey begun by Hitchcock's Psycho, the granddaddy of them all.  The original Chainsaw distinguished itself by its almost complete lack of plot, logic, likeable characters and human drama, while being unmatched in terms of physical impact.  While better horror films have certainly been made (the original Dawn of the Dead, for example), none have been more terrifying.<br /><br />There's a reason why very few of the acknowledged modern-horror classics -- Night of the Living Dead, the original Dawn, Halloween, the original Chainsaw -- were made within the Hollywood system.  When you throw a large amount of budget at a horror film, it often has the inexplicably strange effect of diluting the horror of the film -- just witness George A. Romero's Day of the Dead, the most expensive of his zombie trilogy -- because a higher budget tends to mean more reservations about content, censorship, script sophistication...and the fact that an overly slick look, usually what happens when you raise the budget, just isn't as sick or as horrifying as a film that looks real and rough.<br /><br />Given this adage, I was surprised that this remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre wasn't the complete bust I'd expected it to be.  Sure, I laughed through about half the film, at the commercial-like photography, the lazy and incredibly generic score, the moralizing, the attempts at plot twists, and worst of all the opening, which gives us far too much information we don't need to know.  Somewhere along the line, though, the film eventually got something right -- the insane, unrelenting forward thrust that had made the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre so skeletal yet memorable.<br /><br />This remake is like the misconceptions about the original film made into reality.  The original Chainsaw, despite its ultraviolent reputation, was actually quite devoid of gore.  It does its psychological horror on the audience by virtue of a brutal pacing and sensory assault, but very little explicit violence was shown.  This remake, on the other hand, frequently shows graphic dismemberment and eviscerations.  While this is certainly a less subtle strategy than the original, it works in its own way, delivering the physical threat so often missing from modern horror films.  This remake works best when it's not trying to emulate its predecessor.  The aforementioned opening, complete with "police footage", is just silly, nothing compared to the bare-bones narration that had opened the original, and the two sequences that copy the original Chainsaw -- Leatherface dragging his first victim, and the chase through the woods -- pale alongside the original.  But the new gore sequences work in themselves, and once you survive the useless plot developments of the first act and a half, you get the visceral jolts a horror film is supposed to deliver.<br /><br />Jessica Biel gives her all here, faring much better than the average modern horror actress in conveying animalistic terror.  I was also amused to see Eric Balfour (Milo in the TV series 24) playing her ill-fated boyfriend.  However, the screenwriters went a little too far with the villains, nearly doubling the size of the cannibal clan, and trying to give Leatherface and his family a psychological motivation (Leatherface's disfigurement) is utterly futile.  It's like the final police-station scene of Psycho, or when the Halloween films started giving Michael Myers a reason to kill -- brainless exposition that a horror audience doesn't need.<br /><br />I was surprised to find myself becoming engaged after 25 minutes of wishing this film were over.  So while this new Texas Chainsaw Massacre doesn't match up to the original, it has some definite strong points of its own.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L.html">A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L</a><br/><p>This remake of TCM doesn't really add anything new to the horror genre, nor is it necessarily an improvement when compared with the original, but when viewed without any expectations it makes for a solid thriller.<br /><br />The formula is pretty standard: Pretty kids get shredded in creative ways by a gruesome killer. What I liked most about this film is the well crafted atmosphere of isolation and decrepitude. The environs of the forgotten little southern town where all this takes place are creepy yet believable, albeit in a "all southerners are inbred crazies" sort of way.<br /><br />The film contains enough gore but doesn't go over-the-top, and it's clever enough to keep leatherface at least partially concealed for the majority of the film. They also made the good call of casting Jessica Biel, who's tight fitting white tee is frequently wet.<br /><br />The DVD has limited extras - Some TV spots and trailers and a music video by some heavy metal band. Dolby 5.1 is available. I recommend this version if you're into horror movies and not emotionally attached to the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N49TOJZFG48H.html">A1N49TOJZFG48H</a><br/><p>hey , i was a young person in the 1970s . ten by 73 . yes , it's not a brilliantly accurate period (piece) but it's a damn scary and funny one . in the incredibly capable hands of Lee Ermey we get the ultra smarmy and hilariously over-the-top villian we need . what more could you possibly ask for ? it's not "North by nothwest" for gods sake . the young people go threw living hell and die very brutally (which i personally found truly horrifying and kinda fitting) . they did commit the wanton sins of being young and seeking a good time . this truly is a scary and sick little film . all i can add is two very enthusiastic thumbs off .</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>For over 29 years horror fans have rallied about a small, low budget film that when released scared the hell out of any viewer brave enough to watch it. Of course I am talking about the original TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. Director Tobe Hooper took the story of ghoul/cannibal/murderer Ed Gein and moved him from Michigan to Texas, adding a family and a few other idiosyncrasies along the way.<br /><br />The movie spawned three sequels and several documentaries on the making of the film. It launched a more graphic approach to horror than had been witnessed before. And it created a now legendary horror icon, Leatherface, that has plagued the nightmare land of movie viewers since he first hit the screen in 1974. And now a new generation has their own version of this terrifying tale.<br /><br />Director Marcus Nispel and screenplay author Scott Kosar have decided not to remake the same film seen before so much as retool it for a new set of viewers. Yes, Leatherface is there as well as a weird family. But these folks are not the same ones we saw oh those many years ago.<br /><br />The film opens in the late 70's with a group of friends coming back from a trip to Mexico, heading to a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert. Along the way, they nearly run down a young woman walking alongside the road. Giving her a lift, they sit in stunned silence as she talks of everyone being dead, of there being no escape. And then she pulls a pistol out from between her legs and shoots herself in the head.<br /><br />The friends are stunned and pull off the road. When they set out again, they stop in a local gas station and contact the sheriff who tells them he will meet them near his current location. When they arrive at this destination, they find more than the bargained for.<br /><br />Once tired of waiting, they head out to find a phone and do so in an old house. Dealing with a cantankerous old man there, they get hold of the Sheriff and head back to wait. Circumstances lead to their returning to the house later on and that's when Leatherface pops up to make his first, brain busting appearance.<br /><br />As in most horror films of this type, the movie moves forward as one by one the teens are picked off by the bad guys. The fact that Leatherface doesn't act on his own makes the story even creepier. But it's those scenes of him swinging the chainsaw high and low, the sound of the gas powered engine revving at high speeds that makes it unnerving.<br /><br />The movie offers plenty of scares and jump scenes that catch you off guard. The character of Leatherface is once more one of the most horrific images you can imagine. The pace of the film, the dialogue, the acting, the directing all go hand in hand to create one of the scariest movies this season.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest difference between this movie and the original is the gore factor. I can remember so many people telling me about all of the gore that they witnessed in the original. In going back and watching it now, I am amazed at how little there actually was. Instead, director Tobe Hooper did a fantastic job of making you THINK you saw more than you really did. This time around though, the gore is there, from sledgehammers slammed into head to chainsaws ripping through flesh.<br /><br />While some movies are meant to be seen on a small television screen, this one is not. Does the size of the picture make a difference? No. But...sitting in a darkened theater with 300 strangers watching and waiting for the inevitable to happen makes this movie scarier than even those making it could have hoped for. Next time don't wait for the DVD&lt; head out to a darkened theater near you. In the meantime, give this one a watch if you're a horror fan. If you like scary films, then you won't want to miss this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>This is just another great remake of a very unscarey orginal.

Like the 'Dawn of the Dead' movie in early 2000, this is kind of like a retelling of sorts; The key plotline generally remains the same, but there are some nice changes and unexpected turns as well. I thought the acting overall was really good; Ermey was def. the best surprise here, and the movie had a very sleek look to it that actually complimented it's content. The same cinematographer from the original returns for the remake, and there are some very nice nods to the original; The part w/Leatherface chasing one victim through the clotheslines hung with lots of white sheets was a memorable moment for me..But make no mistake: This movie is brutal in it's violence, and there is alot of it. And while not really 'scary'(except for Sheriff Hoyt...YIKES!!!), this is one intense, horrific ride. The comment on the box read "If you want horror...this IS horror!!".  For once the box speaks the truth. Plus Jessica Biel spends the whole movie is a semi-revealing tank top, so that never hurts as far as I'm concerned...</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>When you talk about the TV shows Desperate Housewives, 7th Heaven, CSI, The OC and even The Guiding Light wouldn't you think it strange to mention The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in the same breath? Similarly, when you say R. Lee Ermey you're usually not talking about 2003 and 2006's Texas Chainsaw Massacre films, right?<br /><br />The main actors in both The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beinning (2006) were plucked right out TV. And R. Lee Ermey?...He starred in both Texas 2003 and 2006, but we all know what we really associate that guy with...the colorful Full Metal Jacket (1987) boot camp sergeant, of course.<br /><br />Ah, and let's not forget the up and coming Jessica Beil (2006's The Illusionist); while the 2003 remake of Texas Chainsaw was one of her first big screen films, I expect that we'll see a lot more leading roles from this fine young talent in the future.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to find a very inexpensive 2 pack on sale at Amazon for the price that just one of the disks is selling for today.

About the movies.<br /><br />Might as well start at The Beginning (2006). The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning was perhaps one of the top 5 most shockingly brutal movies that I have ever seen. Torture. Brutal murder. Intense violence. All acted out superbly by a cast that mostly made you believe that this horrible stuff was happening.<br /><br />The Beginning was directed by short-resumed Horror vet Jonathan Liebesman, and he mostly kept it real. He made his actors take their rolls seriously, unlike so many Horror movies that throw in teenage camp to dumb down the shock. Liebsman had only a few "oh c'mon that would never happen" scenes versus almost an "oh my God" ever 5 minutes throughout the 96 minute Horror gala (that's like 25 'oh-my-Gods').<br /><br />The over the top and stretch the imagination scenes are enough to bring the film down a notch, but I was out of breath after exposure to so much shock and awe by the time the credits rolled. So The Beginning was affectively above average.<br /><br />The thing about The Beginning is that you know it's not the end. No happy ending expectations here; just a sense of dread for all who come in contact with Sheriff Hoyt's family of degenerates. The Beginning is the prequel that plays right into The Texas Chainsaw 2003 remake of the original 1974 Tobe Hooper cult classic that shocked the nation. Hooper had oversight as a producer in both Texas 2003 and 2006.<br /><br />2003's remake was probably about 1/2 as brutal as the 2006 (unrated version) story of The Beginning, so that should speak volumes as to how to set your expectations. Texas 2003 continues the murderous story of the unfortunate that ventured to close to Sheriff Hoyt's jurisdiction.<br /><br />Shock and awe (or should I say shock and gore) should not be confused with greatness. Both Texas 2003 and 2006 were good Horror movies. They were better gross-out movies. So all in all, if you're into Horror, these moves do indeed epitomize the genre. They are good...not great.

The tension and horror that was felt in the first movie is still present in this one.<br /><br />The acting in the movie is excellent. The characters are 100% believable. You hate the villains and you root for the good guys even though you know the outcome if you saw the original movie.<br /><br />While no, Tobe Hooper, this director does an excellent job at mainting the eerie feeling the first had.<br /><br />Visuals were incredible, very cringing special fx that sometimes made you not want to watch but compelled to anyway.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent movie. A very tension filled horror movie that makes Leatherface a villain to remember and fear. Leather face is very well done in this movie even though the family's reasosn for killing people is unknown. In the original, they were cannibals. Either, this is a good film to watch, it will leave you on the edge of your seat!</p></br><a href="../users/A3IMNZSYDOTTU6.html">A3IMNZSYDOTTU6</a><br/><p>It seems these days that many directors are out to remake classic or older horror movies. We have seen THE FOG remade; we have seen DAWN OF THE DEAD remade; we are going to see WHEN A STRANGER CALLS and THE SENTINEL (although not confirmed) remade; but now, we have already bore witness to the TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE remake. Does it live up to the chill of the original? Not quite, but it's still entertaining. R Lee Ermey is absolutely hilarious as the insane cop "family" member, and although there are some thrills, this remake cannot match the power of the original which shocked us back in 1974.<br /><br />There are some things different about the remake that should not have been changed at all. For instance, the five teens traveling in the van run into a girl who is wandering the road, and not looking too well. In the original, Edwin Neal was much better as the crazed guy who likes "head cheese". The girl in this one just seemed to underplay her role, and she wasn't very convincing, but she was very much traumatized by something. After she blows her brains out, they ditch the pot they have in a horse pinata and, eventually, the girl after the crazy "sheriff" comes to get rid of the body. They go to an abandoned mill and find a young boy, Jebediah, and the two leads, Jessica Biel and Eric Balfour (who are competent in their roles), proceed to the house of hell. The father in this movie, instead of being dead, was alive and legless in a wheel chair. The first kill of the movie wasn't as powerful as in the original. Where in the original the guy ran to the door and Leatherface appeared and clocked him in the head, in this one Leatherface (played well by Andrew Bryniarski) clocks the guy after he goes into the living room where we see cartoons playing on the television. That to me just says "straight-ahead" horror film, not powerful shocker. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but if you're going to remake a film (which you're almost doomed for bad reviews), you better be damn close to the original.<br /><br />The rest of the movie plays as a straight-ahead slasher, with Bryniarski playing the Leatherface role almost as good as Gunnar Hansen from the original. The way Leatherface is in this movie, his behavior and movements, are more funny than scary (but still creepy at times). In the original, they were funny but disturbing and scary. But some of the performances in this version are throw-aways, and some are good like R Lee Ermey's performance. It seemed like Jessica Biel, while handling her role well, was more in the movie for eye-candy than anything, but I can't discredit her believable performance. She nailed the girl of the original almost to a tee. The intro and the epilogue (narrated by John Laroquette) were actually good, and I liked the way they started and ended the film. Unfortunately, the fact that this was more a straight slasher film took away from the power of the original.<br /><br />Remakes are not going to be quite as good most of the time when you make them, and TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE was no exception. While I still found this movie entertaining (yes, the platinum series 2-disc version currently sits in my collection), it cannot match the power of the original. While the running time was short and the pace of the movie was quick, the quality must match the quantity. And while not a failure by any means, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW remake can't be recommended as more than an enjoyable, straight-ahead slasher movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>On August 18th, 1973, in Texas, the youths Erin (Jessica Biel), her boy-friend Kemper (Eric Balfour), their friends Andy (Mike Vogel) and Morgan (Jonathan Tucker) and the hitchhiker Pepper (Erica Leerhsen) are returning from a vacation in Mexico to a concert of the Lynnard Skynnard. Kemper is driving his van, when they see a disturbed young woman dangerously wandering on the road. They decide to help her, and the woman commits suicide inside the vehicle. They decide to look for a telephone to call the Sheriff, and they end in the house of Thomas Hewitt (Andrew Bryniarski), where their lives are threatened by the sick Leatherface and his deranged family.<br /><br />Taken as a remake, this is a good film. The story was different enough to keep me guessing, the characters were, uhhh, fleshed out a little more. While the original at times seemed like a documentary, this one was a straight-up horror movie, though without too many of the cliches that make modern horror movies tedious.<br /><br />On it's own, this was a very good horror movie. Well-filmed, well-acted, suspensful, with good characters. The kids in this movie are not all just obnoxious kids--they get into trouble because of a good deed, so I found myself rooting for them, even the annoying one or two. The casting of Lee Ermey as the sheriff is icing on the cake; he definitely brought the movie up a few notches.<br /><br />While not a classic, this remake is worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EIK4L9730WWJ.html">A2EIK4L9730WWJ</a><br/><p>The new Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a great remake of the 1974 one with Marilyn Burns!!!!!!

This is a must own dvd in any horror collection!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A13H7Q4JVK6DTV.html">A13H7Q4JVK6DTV</a><br/><p>This is not the same as the 1974 version but I still think it's great because it's a little different then the original and more updated.A couple of young adults go down to texas to see a concert but they pick up a hitchiker and things start to go crazy the kids get cut up and mess up and is worth a look at I can't say how but you'll be scare and entertain at what you see.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Director Michael Bay, who also directed "Pearl Harbor", has made a very scary and gory remake of Tobe Hopper's classic original film.<br /><br />Five friends, Erin (Jessica Biel), Morgan (Jonathan Tucker), Pepper (Erica Leerhsen), Andy (Mike Vogel), and Kemper (Eric Balfour), are headed to Dallas to see a Lynrd Skynard concert.  Along the way, they encounter a mysterious hitchhiker alongside the road.  Erin and Pepper convince the guys to give her a ride.  This proves to be a huge mistake, as she is convinced that people are out to kill her.  Suddenly, she pulls out a gun and shoots herself.<br /><br />Shocked and upset, the others decide that they should contact the local sheriff, so they pull into a nearby gas station.  They are told to meet the sheriff at the Crawford home.  While waiting for the sheriff to arrive, the friends venture inside the house, when suddenly, Kemper is struck in the back and dragged off by a leather-faced, chainsaw-wielding maniac. What happens next is beyond imagination as the friends struggle to save themselves, and it turns out that Sheriff Hoyt, played wonderfully by veteran actor R. Lee Ermey, turns out to be just as crazy as "Leatherface".<br /><br />Unable to escape from this nightmare, Leatherface begins picking each person off one by one until only Erin remains.  Will she survive, or will she meet the same fate as her unfortunate friends?<br /><br />I saw the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre by Tobe Hopper, and I thought this movie was nearly as good as the original.  The storylines differed a little bit, but this movie is every bit as scary as the first, and Leatherface is very menacing as well.  There were some scenes that were hard to understand, such as the scene where Morgan charges into Leatherface, causing him to drop his chainsaw.  Erin, who was lying on the floor nearby, could easily have picked up the chainsaw and ended everything, but instead she tried hitting him with her fists, which did no good at all.  Overall, I found this movie to be scary and thrilling to watch.  Needless to say, this is not a movie for children due to the violence.  It compares favorably to the original and will definitely give you a good scare along the way.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>I watched this movie on Friday the 13th expecting a stupid horror movie that I would laugh at and not be scared at all. But, actually, it was a good movie that had a couple scary and tense moments. The movie is disturbing and is based on a true story. It's about a chainsaw wielding maniac that hacked a group of youngsters up. It's in the middle of nowhere and this nutcase also has some allies... Well, a group of friends led by the gorgeous Jessica Biel are driving in Texas when a lady just walks in the middle of the road. They take her in the car trying to help her but she says that "he's going to get her". She then commits suicide by shooting herself in the mouth in a very disturbing but wonderfully made (filmed) scene. This group of youngsters then find out that the sheriff wants to mmet them at an old mill, which sounds suspicious. But when he doesn't show and one by one they start dissapearing, the group's nervous, especially after there's a guy running after them with a chainsaw. The movie has some thrills, scary moments, and humor and is surprisingly a good movie. Mark this one down as a surprise and it's definitely worth a rent.<br /><br />But, what I don't understand is:<br /><br />1. How can that absolutley huge maniac wielding a huge chainsaw run as fast as very fit and athlethic youngsters?<br /><br />2. How does the maniac start his chainsaw after one of his arms gets chopped off? With his teeth?</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>The controversial remake of the classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre may not be without it's flaws, but it isn't as bad as it has been reputed to be since it's release.  While the remake doesn't live up to the sheer terror and gritiness of the original film, it succeeds on it's own as a more than solid horror film that is better than almost every other horror movie to have been released in the last few years.  There are many similarities between this version and the original, most of all the storyline.  Five young people (led by Jessica Biel) on a back Texas road pick up a hitchiker.  Followed by a series of chilling events, they find themselves all picked off one by one by a chainsaw wielding maniac named Leatherface.  Rookie film director Marcus Nispel and producer Michael Bay (director of Pearl Harbor, Armageddon, The Rock, and the Bad Boys films) used the much bigger budget to their advantage giving Leatherface a bigger family (including Full Metal Jacket favorite R. Lee Ermey), plenty of blood and gore, and enough lingering suspense to make the film worth watching.  The gallows humor featured in the original isn't here, and the film is too long for it's own good, but it still manages to stand alone as a creepy and suspenseful horror film, even though it doesn't come close to matching Tobe Hooper's original masterpiece.  This Platinum Series Special Edition is packed with plenty of extras that will satisfy even jaded horror buffs, and is definitely worth the extra cash.</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>I have never seen the original, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one! Let me start saying, that I made a mistake of eatting dinner and watching this movie at the same time. Um, yeah, I could hardly chew, and it was only the beginning.<br />The cast is quickly overwhelmed by the unfamiliar terriotry, and sneaky people who aren't as helpful as they seem. It's in the middle of a hot, gross and sticky summer day.<br />Some of the scenes are brutal, but I did not see any cannibalism in it.<br />Nevertheless, the running, chasing, blood splattering, and the real suspence of what is next was great.<br />If you are looking for a heart tumping movie, the go for it!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>This is my second favorite horror remake right behind &quot;Dawn of the Dead.&quot; I have already reviewed the film once, so now I will talk about the features on the Platinum Series Special Edition. First off you get three commentary tracks, which I don't care for, but lots of people seem to like to listen to this sort of thing. Then you get an awesome 75 minute making of feature that talks about the old TCM and the new one. Then you get a 25 minute documentary feature on the real life sick pycho Ed Gein who influenced the making of the original TCM and many other horror films. This documentary contains real footage and some disturbing photographs and it's quite hard to fathom what Gein actually did to people's bodies. Very morbid feature, yet somehow very interesting. Then you get about 8 deleted scenes. The only one that stands out is Alternate Death of Morgan. In the film Leatherface hooks him up to the ceiling and you hear his chainsaw, but it never shows what he does and Morgan dies almost instantly. But in this deleted scene, lets just say the scene left a much bigger impression in my mind and the film could have benefited from more chainsaw gore since you don't really see the Pepper girl killed either. You also get your promotional stuff: Trailer, Photo Galleries, and DVD-Rom Feature. Make sure you buy this Special Edition version, because for only around $10.00 more you get loads of stuff. Also included in the set is a cool metal display cover featuring Leatherface and 8 Crime Scene Photos. Not to mention the dvd display folds out with a chainsaw background. This Disc is worth every penny to all horror fans out there.</p></br></body></html>

In particular, I was really irritated at how inaccurate they made the '35 Baer title fight. In reality, this was no slugfest. Max never looked like a crazed beast during it. Jimmy spent much of the fight circling to his right. Mostly the two boxers clinched and threw ineffective inside uppercuts.<br /><br />There were no two low blows, no face slap and no moment near the end of Round 15 when Braddock was staggered wth Max closing in for a headshot kill. In reality, Baer lost his zest for headhunting after he killed a man in the ring. Worst of all was the elimination of Baer's Star of David from his trunks. Max was proud of his Jewish heritage and this symbol should've been retained. Political correctness is nonsense, especially when supposedly depicting actual events.<br /><br />To see the REAL fight in its entirety, check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BDGWHQ">CINDERELLA MAN: THE JAMES J. BRADDOCK STORY</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>During the Great Depression, a common-man hero, James J. Braddock--a.k.a. the Cinderella Man, was to become one of the most surprising sports legends in history. By the early 1930s, the impoverished ex-prizefighter was seemingly as broken-down, beaten-up and out-of-luck as much of the rest of the American populace who had hit rock bottom. His career appeared to be finished, he was unable to pay the bills, the only thing that mattered to him--his family--was in danger, and he was even forced to go on Public Relief. But deep inside, Jim Braddock never relinquished his determination. Driven by love, honor and an incredible dose of grit, he willed an impossible dream to come true. In a last-chance bid to help his family, Braddock returned to the ring. No one thought he had a shot. However Braddock, fueled by something beyond mere competition, kept winning. Suddenly, the ordinary working man became the mythic athlete. Carrying the hopes and dreams of the disenfranchised on his shoulders, Braddock rocketed through the ranks, until this underdog chose to do the unthinkable: take on the heavyweight champ of the world, the unstoppable Max Baer, renowned for having killed two men in the ring. Ron Howard has made of the real life of Depression-era prize-fighter James J. Braddock is a work of art. This is a truly great movie. Russel Crowe, Rene Zellweger and Paul Giametti are all fabulous. I recommend it highly.</p></br><a href="../users/AMKZHBOK7VMQR.html">AMKZHBOK7VMQR</a><br/><p>When I saw the previews for Cinderella Man I thought it was an attempt to use the formula from SeaBisquiet, (underdog to hero in the depression era.) It turned out to be a much better movie for a lot of reasons. First and foremost the boxing sequences are realistic and compelling. Second Russell Crowe is absolutely convincing and credible as a man literally fighting to save his family from the ravages of the depression. Ron Howard did an amazing job on this film and it succeeds as a human interest story , an historical drama and as a great boxing film.  The supporting cast is great. A truly fine production.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>James Braddock had two great opponents in his lifetime, Max Bauer and the Great Depression.  We see with what finesse he is able to confront both in this stylish and lovable movie. Braddock is a fine boxer, able to support himself and his family well.  He breaks his hand in a fight and manfully tries to keep going, only to ruin his career.  It doesn't help that the Depression comes along to take what's left of him and his family.  He does all he can to survive, like most Americans during desperate times, but he picks himself up until he gets another chance.  After working on the shipyard and his hand recovers, he gets to go back in the ring.  He gradually succeeds until he can face Max Bauer, a cruel and notorious fighter.<br /><br />"Cinderella Man" is a super movie.  It has the struggle and heart of the best boxing movies (like "Rocky" and "Raging Bull") especially with a good story to go behind the scenes. The performances are formidable.  Russell Crowe is brimming with toughness and decency as Braddock, and Renee Zellweger is nuanced as his nervous, but caring wife.  Paul Giamatti is also in fine form as his manager.  Director Ron Howard has accomplished much by zeroing in on every detail; every development and every punch line is embellished well in this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>With all the hype that surrounded this movie, I thought it would not be too good, especially since I recently saw a documentary on the life of Jim Braddock.  However, this is one instance where the movie actually surpassed the hype!  This movie does such a good job depicting New York City during the Depression that I literally felt transported back in time.  The acting is great and the fight scenes are the most realistic that I have ever seen in a boxing movie (including Raging Bull).<br /><br />As most people are already familiar with Jim Braddock's life, I will not give a synopsis of the plot.  There are many heartwarming scenes especially when Rene Zellweger (Jim's wife) is helpless to take care of her child who appears to be sick with pneumonia.  Another is when Jim is desperate to get his kids back, painfully goes asking for a handout and for government assistance.  There are quite a few excellent supporting actors (the actor who starred in Sideways and the actor who played Jean Claude VanDame's friend in Time Cop) as well as the menacing actor who plays Max Baer.  You can cut the tension with a knife when Jim has to step in the ring with Baer, knowing that he recently killed two fighters in the ring.<br /><br />Not to be missed!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Cinderella Man is the story of human victory over seemingly impossible odds. Russell Crowe plays legendary boxer James J. Braddock in Ron Howard's well directed film based on the life of this astounding man.<br /><br />Set during the Great Depression, the film takes on the tone of loss as we witness Braddock's initial rise in the boxing ring and then his rapid decline during the disastrous economic punch that landed a low-blow to America and the world. Millions are out of work and on the street. Families are ripped apart. But Braddock and his wife Mae (played by Renee Zellweger) will do anything to keep their heads above water while remaining morally upstanding citizens.<br /><br />Like many families, the Braddocks have to sell just about everything to stay alive. And once everything of value is gone, Braddock has to work at the back-breaking docks, but even that's not enough to sustain them. Braddock is forced to beg for money from acquaintances, and this is a terribly humiliating event to watch. But if that wasn't enough, he has to go to the government office for public assistance.<br /><br />Then a glimmer of hope arrives. His old manager Joe Gould (the awesomely intense Paul Giamoti) offers him one last fight with a heavyweight title contender. The assumption is that Braddock will lose, not having trained for months and having eaten only scraps off the street. But Braddock wins, relaunching his career and eventually getting a shot at Max Baer, the champ who's blows have killed two men already.<br /><br />History tells us that Braddock wins this fight, to the surprise of the then boxing commission and to the joy of millions of downtrodden Americans.<br /><br />More interesting than the crunching blows and bloody fights are the surrounding circumstances of what America was going through at the time and how Braddock held his head high (at least as high as he could) in such trying times.<br /><br />Getting a myopic view of family life during this time was a powerful way to present such a rags to riches story. The costumes and sets were spot-on period perfect and completely immersed the viewer in the times. Filming the struggling family pulled the movie-watcher close to the Braddocks and gave a sense of empathy that few directors can match these days. And the brutal boxing scenes were painful to watch. I flinched several times, wanting to look away but unable to for fear of missing something.<br /><br />Having lavished such praise on this film, I have to comment on the cookie-cutout cinema Mr. Howard chooses to shoot (you remember Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind, right?) Although I enjoy these heart-wrenching and uplifting movies, I do wish that Mr. Howard could break out of that mold and produce something beyond the mainstream.<br /><br />But make no mistake, this is an intense movie with graphic depictions of Braddock landing obscenely hard blows ...and taking them, too. The greatness of the actual filming cannot be denied but the commonality of it won't surprise those who've seen a Ron Howard film in the past.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R8LZYZR3377O.html">A1R8LZYZR3377O</a><br/><p>There can be no higher praise given to a film. This is what good, solid filmmaking is all about. If you love boxing films you will flip over this picture. Ron Howard got it right. Heart and depth are perfect adjectives to describe what unfolds before you. Russell Crow should easily have won an acadamy award for his portrayal as Braddock. The semi rags to riches story of a boxer in the 30's who forges on against overwhelming odds should grab even the most emotionally closed of persons.<br />  Paul Giamitti is spot on as Braddocks trainer, showing us all what it takes to throw oneself into a role. The highs and lows of life, the force of passion, true love and brutal honesty make it work on all levels. The depression era look is drab enough to feel, bringing the charactors despair realisticly to the forefront. And, of course being a boxing film it has action aplenty in the ring. The "chic flick" elements give the movie an ability to be soft and tender, but the harsh blows of action will hold the male audiences eyes. Both sexes can appreciate this well done made in America story. Destined to be a true classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Not since Rocky has such a gritty look at a poor family and a underdog becoming a hero been seen. What made Rocky great was Stallone had a shoestring budget that required the best for the least and a knack for making a great story breath life. The superb acting, story, music, and sets make Cinderella Man come to life. If you liked Rocky or any other movies that have realistic people you should enjoy this one. Once again Crowe comes through with a splendid job of acting. The support cast has some notables that give the feeling of real people that lived through the depression. Be ready with some tissues for this one. Don't miss it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>Good movie but flawed factually. I thought this was a very good movie all the way around. The only problem I had was the portrayal of Max Baer. If you don't know anything about him this won't bother you. Max was not the ogre and villian as portrayed in the movie. It was said by his son that when he accidentally killed a man in the ring that he cried his eyes out and had nightmares about it for the rest of his life. Also Max was the clown prince of boxing and an easy going partier who loved to have a good time and was good natured. The thing that bothered me about him being portrayed as such a heel and evil villian is that people who don't know the truth will take this as the truth. But I must say they way they portray Max as the heel and Braddock as the good guy does make for good cinema.<br /><br />That said Russell Crowe and Craig Bierko shine as the two great fighters. The story is a natural underdog story. It will also show people what it was like in the great depression and how people literally had nothing.<br /><br />I thought the fight scenes were passable and being a boxer and fan I am not impressed by most of hollywoods boxing sequences (Homeboy with Mickey Rourke being one of the most realistic I have seen filmed and Rocky being one of the worst ever). Renee Zellweger is good in her role and Paul Giamani is excellent as his Crowes trainer.<br /><br />Good movie check it out. Its well worth purchasing.</p></br><a href="../users/A31D8QKJXU93BT.html">A31D8QKJXU93BT</a><br/><p>Ron Howard's last two movies, "A Beautiful Mind" and "Cinderella Man," are perhaps his most accomplished, and they star Russell Crowe at perhaps his most appealing. For both, Howard assembled the same filmmaking team, including the same writer. This is a boxing movie the way "Million Dollar Baby" is a boxing movie; the characters are boxers serving a larger theme. "Baby" was about a controversial social issue; "Cinderella Man" is about the real-life James Braddock boxing to feed his family during the Depression and inspiring hope among the impoverished, the way Seabiscuit at the time inspired the same people.<br /><br />It's a sentimental story, told without sentimentality, about a man given a second chance. Crowe as Braddock, Renee Zwellinger as his wife and Paul Giamatti as his manager all deliver, as do the supporting players, many of them actual boxers. The re-creation of period is spot-on, the fight sequences are choreographed closely to the real fights and photographed with exactitude, and the venues for the fights are triumphs of location and set design. In short, this movie is the real thing, really well made, and really moving.<br /><br />Crowe makes Braddock a decent man, a father devoted to his wife and kids. He learns that fighting for a cause, his family's survival, is better than fighting for fame, which he wears lightly. Giamatti, who deserves an Oscar nod, and Zwellinger (her second boxing film after "Jerry Maguire") provide skilled support. "Cinderella Man" is full of heart and hope, in a different league entirely than "Raging Bull," "The Set Up," "Body and Soul," "The Harder They Fall" and the hokey "Rocky" franchise.<br /><br />It falls short of perfect. Yet again we have a loving but whining wife who withholds support of her husband when he most needs it. Product placement reigns as every fight in every venue in every town is broadcast by NBC, its logo displayed as though no other broadcaster was there. Boxer Max Baer is depicted as the anti-Christ. But these don't distract from the ring, home and Depression sequences, which are Howard's real achievement. They establish him as a Hollywood director of the first rank.<br /><br />Quibbles about this two-disc collector's edition: it has hit-and-miss extras, three repetitive commentaries, discs difficult to extract from the case, and a lid that won't stay shut. Of the deleted scenes, the director says they are good enough for the final cut, portending a post-Oscar extended DVD (doubtless when Howard's "DaVinci Code" is out) for those of us who have just shelled out for this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Shakespeare wrote in Romeo and Juliette "What's in a name? That which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet." The reason I bring this up is Ron Howard's "Cinderella Man" made me think over and over of another boxing film of 30 years ago.  In that film there was also a struggling boxer who had been knocked around by life and the ring before almost miraculously being guided towards a chance at the Heavyweight Championship.  Both films feature a shy, softspoken woman character - although in the other film the woman is not yet his wife.  Both films feature a terrifying, loud-mouthed reigning champion who our underdog hero meets in the film's final act in a knock-down drag-out 15 round bout that ends, not with a knockout, but with a decision.  Both films feature charismatic managers who believe in their fighters and make sacrifices to give them a chance - although Paul Giamatti's performance is certainly different from Burgess Meredith's. Both of our boxing underdog heroes even buy pet turtles.  Was there anyone else who didn't see a fair amount of "Rocky" in "Cinderella Man"?  No - I don't mean Rocky IV and V, after Sylvester Stallone had made two iconic movie characters (Rocky and Rambo) into buffoons.  I mean that first Rocky movie - the one that earned the Oscar and the hearts of movie-goers everywhere.  This isn't back-handed praise for "Cinderella Man".<br /><br />With all due respect to Mr. Stallone, who gave the performance of his life in that, his first feature, he is not Russell Crowe.  James J. Braddock comes to living, breathing life in Mr. Crowe's performance, and Ron Howard was wise (as he so often is) choosing to pair himself once again with his "Beautiful Mind" star.  Unlike Rocky, which was set in it's current era, "Cinderella Man" begins moments before the great depression, then spends the first half of the movie showing us how severe things are in the depression.  As my momma would have said, these folks are "bad off".  Braddock earns thousands of dollars in an early bout - later in the film after injuries and the depression have beaten him to near despair he is deliriously happy at the opportunity to earn $250 in a match where he is likely to be beaten senseless.<br /><br />James J. Braddock broke his hand - several times we are told - and the boxing commission pulled his license after a particularly poor showing.  Not trained for any other career, but with a dogged determination to provide for his family, he shows up every day at the locked gates outside the loading docks so that he can work all day hauling heavy sacks to earn not nearly enough money to pay the landlord AND the electricity.  At one point his son steals a salami because he has heard that if there isn't enough to eat that families get broken up and the children sent to live with distant relatives.<br /><br />The thing that allows Cinderella Man to stand alongside "Rocky" and "Million Dollar Baby" and "Raging Bull" at the pinnacle of boxing films (aside from the cinematography, editing, writing and "little things" that the movie-makers get just right here) are the very human characterizations.  Rocky never has to go down to Madison Square Garden to beg for 18 dollars so that he can pay the electric bill and keep his family together.  At one point Braddock goes to the office where small financial handouts are given out to the needy.  The Braddocks have, indeed, become needy.  The woman on the otherside of the money cage sadly shakes her head.  "I never thought I'd see YOU here", she says.  Later, Braddock returns to that office to stand in line, and what he does there demonstrates part of why James J. Braddock became a folk hero to the people of the depression.<br /><br />In many cases, you know where this film is headed.  Howard, Crowe, Zellweger and Giamatti make the trip enjoyable nonetheless.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Comes a great movie. Howard is the consumate pro.

However, thanks to a last minute cancellation and some effort by his close friend and longtime trainer, he found himself back in the ring... Knowing now that the difference between winning and losing is how much food and warmth he can provide for his wife and kids, Jim finds the motivation that he needed to win the match...<br /><br />Crowe conveys with great sincerity the feeling of desperation of a humble man giving his all to his family and his profession as a boxer... At his lowest moment, Braddock swallows the last of his pride and goes before the Boxing Federation who fired him from boxing (because he hasn't been winning, mostly due to injuries), begging them for pocket change to buy "milk" for his children... In this powerful scene, we truly feel the harsh reality of those times...<br /><br />Crowe is tremendously appealing in scenes depicting his tender relationship with his children: His care while telling his hungry little daughter about his dream of a thick juice steak persuading her to eat his meager supper because he is too full to eat it, his love when promising his oldest son, Jay, he'll never send him away, no matter how bad things get...<br /><br />The supporting cast is exceptional:<br /><br />Renee Zellwegger is very good as Braddock's adoring wife... She is a soft-spoken blond, shy-eyed type, who remains strong no matter how much force is exerted against it, making do with watered-down milk... Her need to let Jimmy fight, and to bring money to pay the bills, always gets shattered by her fear that one day he will walk out the door to leave her a widow...<br /><br />Paul Giamatti is terrific as the fast-talking boxing manager trying to keep up appearances of success amidst the depression...<br /><br />Craig Bierko amuses but terrifies as the much-feared Max Baer whose pleasant face masks the heart of a man who will do anything to win... The film makes Baer out to be an arrogant figure, who enjoys beating and even killing his rivals in the ring... Seeing Braddock's wife Mae, Baer utters, "She's too young to be a widow."<br /><br />With dramatic images of the Depression Era, Howard's "The Cinderella Man" is a fine boxing motion picture, very entertaining and sentimental... The boxing sequences are wonderfully photographed, bringing the audience right into the ring... We can really feel the cool, oily, smoky sweatiness of the "world's most famous arena."</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>It's difficult to pick the most impressive element of "Cinderella Man."  Is it the gritty truth of the boxing scenes, which are some of the best ever done?  Or does the movie's strength lie in its authentic recreation of Depression-era New Jersey and New York City?  Or is it the ensemble of great talent (Russell Crowe in the title role of James Braddock, Rene Zellweger as his loving, tough wife Mae, or Paul Giamatti as Braddock's manager, the lovable schlub Joe Gould)?<br /><br />Well, fortunately we really don't have to choose what we like most about "Cinderalla Man," but suffice it to say that we like it a lot.  Ron Howard reunited with Crowe after their smash hit "A Beautiful Mind," and it's plain to see that these two bring out the best in each other.<br /><br />James Braddock, the "Bulldog of Bergen," opens the film as a contender for the light-heavyweight title.  In a single bout in 1928, Braddock earns over $8,000, after paying all his expenses.  This, at a time when, as Braddock will soon learn, it costs forty four dollars to turn the electricity back on after you're three months behind.  We first see Braddock chiseled, cocky, and dominant.<br /><br />My, how things change!  In the span of a few months, the nation is tanking, and Braddock isn't doing much better.  Rather than spoiled by the fruits of victory (he didn't start drinking or whoring around), Braddock just got injured.  This is not a compassionate era for America - when Braddock breaks his right hand in a bout and still keeps fighting, the boxing authorities not only revoke his license, they also refuse to pay him the $50 he was promised for the fight because he didn't put on a good show.<br /><br />Reduced to begging for shifts down at "the docks," Braddock barely keeps his family together -- with a lot of help from his bedrock Mae -- but he is soon forced to go on public assistance.  This is correctly evoked as a shameful act . . . this was a time in America when being on the public "dole" was one of the worst things that could happen to a proud man.  Crowe nails his depiction of a man armed only with his decency, now that his boxing has been taken away.<br /><br />But, as one can expect, a lifeline gets tossed to Braddock as Gould wheedles the boxing authorities to give Braddock another fight.  His license isn't restored - the boxing world needs a punching bag to replace a last-minute cancellation against a hot up-and-comer, and Braddock was known to be desperate.  This bout starts Braddock's long march to rememption, culminating with a title fight against the monster Max Baer, who had killed two men in the ring.<br /><br />Based on a true story, "Cinderalla Man" strives for greatness and almost makes it.  The story loses focus a couple of times, with hints at Braddock being the stand-in for the downtrodden of New York and New Jersey, and also a bit about the rise of the labor movement.  It's clear that this movie was supposed to be a "great sports film" in the pantheon of "Million Dollar Baby" and "Bull Durham," and it's not that.  "Cinderlla Man" goes into the pantheon of excellent feel-good sports movies, like "Rudy," "Seabiscuit," and "Legend," that are darn fine entertainment and worthy of our attention.  Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ8DU6XVA3USJ.html">AQ8DU6XVA3USJ</a><br/><p>Russell Crowe is magnificent as boxer Jim Braddock, in a multi-layered performance that shows he is perhaps the most versatile and brilliant actor alive. Braddock's true-life story is one of a comeback in 1934, from the pit of destitution during the great depression, and much more; it is about uncompromising ideals, the love of a husband for his strong and devoted wife, and never giving up, despite incredible odds. The supporting cast is also terrific, with Ren&eacute;e Zellwegger wonderful as Mae Braddock, and Paul Giamatti outstanding as Braddock's manager, Joe Gould. Among others in the cast that shine are Craig Bierko as champion boxer Max Baer, Paddy Considine as Braddock's friend Mike, and Rosemarie DeWitt, who plays Mike's wife Sara, and is Braddock's real-life granddaughter.<br /><br />Masterfully directed by Ron Howard, this is a film with substance, a rarity considering Hollywood's recent output, and a joy to view repeatedly. The cinematography by Salvatore Totino is remarkable, capturing the look of the era with what looks like natural lighting, and the fight scenes are astounding. Adding to the beauty of this film is the score by Thomas Newman, and I especially like the music during the 15th round of the Braddock/Baer fight. The disappointing box office take in its theatrical release must have been devastating to those who worked so hard on "Cinderella Man," but this film is sure to become a classic, and known as one of the finest boxing films ever made, thanks to its excellent DVD package.<br /><br />The DVD has loads of extras, including 3 separate commentaries, by Howard, and writers Akiva Goldsman and Cliff Hollingsworth. Of special interest are the "Deleted Scenes," with the extraordinary "splint scene," as well as archival footage of the Braddock/Baer fight, and other interviews, film clips and stills of the Braddock family and those relevant to the story. "Cinderella Man" is 144 minutes of superb filmmaking, with a performance by Crowe that is unforgettable, and a fabulous 2-sided DVD package that makes it a purchase one won't regret.</p></br><a href="../users/A33IZJVCKFKDPU.html">A33IZJVCKFKDPU</a><br/><p>What he has done is created the best film of the year, so far.<br /><br />This movie seems like your classic riches to rags and back to riches story, and essentially it is.  But it also goes a little deeper.  This story takes place in 1930, and for all you history majors, thats during the great depression.  Jim Braddock (Crowe) was the top fighter during the late 1920s.  Then the depression happened, age and injuries that he couldn't afford to repair started to take their toll, and suddenly Jim Braddock is an average man that goes to the docks everyday looking for some work.  He is having a really tough time trying to support his family, until he gets a lucky break.  He gets a chance at another fight because someone dropped out.  What does he do in this fight?  He whoops up on his opponent and gets back into the boxing circle.  After continuing wins, he gets a shot at the champ, Max Baer.  Baer is the most dominant boxer of the time.  He actually killed two men in the ring. YIKES!!  None the less, Braddock fights him in the championship and ....<br /><br />This movie is almost like a sure-fire can't miss.  It has Ron Howard directing.  We all know what he is capable of doing and man, does he do it good here.  He creates a great image a depression era.  The lighting is very dim, there are not very many colors and even down to not making Russell Crowe too big, that way he looks more like a 1930s era boxer, Ron Howard sure knows what he is doing as a director.  Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger star in this film.  I'm pretty sure that both will recieve Oscar nominations for their roles in this flick. And stealing the show from both actors is Paul Giamatti (who is the most under-rated actor in the business) doing the supporting role as Braddock's trainer Joe Gould.  He provides the comic relief in a film that definitely needs a little.  Theres a really good storyline of survival during the depression and its one of those feel good movies that makes you proud to be an American.<br /><br />If my first statement wasen't enough to hint at my recommendation, here it is again.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!  The first 45 minutes of this movie move a little slow but hang in there, the ending is worth the wait.  I guess you can say that this movie is a knockout.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HG2DOSBZEX4I.html">A1HG2DOSBZEX4I</a><br/><p>I must admit that I viewed this film with some trepidation. I had seemed to me that I had seen this film before. America struggling through the Great Depression needs a hero to lift its spirits and get it on the road to recovery. Two years ago a film called Seabiscuit was supposed to have done this. This year we find out that the real hero of the people is a down on his luck boxer named Jimmy Braddock. Thirty years ago it was a down on his luck boxer named Rocky.<br /><br />I guess part of me balked at the idea that the promotional campaign for this film promised your money back if you didn't enjoy the film. That scares me a little. The film is watchable and has some great performances even though it is not anything special. Kudos do need to be given to Paul Giamatti in one of the best roles of his career. It is a real shame that he did not pick up the Oscar for his performance. Ron Howard's direction is up to his usual standards it's just that this is not one of his best films. The screenplay by Akiva Goldsman is well written but also nothing fantastic (even though more deserving  of praise than A Beautiful Mind).<br /><br />On the whole this is a good film  well worth a watch, it just didn't strike me as wonderful. Apparently many fans felt the same way looking at its poor box office showing. The DVD comes packed with three commentaries by Howard, Goldsman ,and story developer Cliff Hollingsworth and several promotional featurettes. A gripe I had with this package is that one had to flip the disc to get to the additional bonus features.

Indeed, it is the embodiment of the American Dream.<br /><br />This is the story of Jim Braddock: a hackneyed, washed-up boxer who, in the grips of the Great Depression, fights his way to the top of professional boxing, against all odds.<br /><br />Russell Crowe and Renne Zellwegger are very impressive in their roles, certainly headed for awards in this fine performance. The grittiness, hopelessness and desperation of depression America is powerfully portrayed in this beautiful film.<br /><br />Be prepared for a lump in your throat as you watch a beaten man fight for his family, his dignity and his country.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N.html">A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N</a><br/><p>This is a phenominal story of the late,great James J. Braddock.A guy who at one time had his title shot,and when the market crashed in 1929,he(like most everyone else)lost everything.This is not a film about boxing,boxing is merely a character in the film like everyone else.This is a film about family,struggling through hard times,not giving up and following through with your dreams and instincts.Russel Crowe again puts on a spectacular performace as well as making the physicaly transformation into a boxer.Paul Giamatti is also a fantastic on screen presence and puts on a great performance as Braddock's manager&trainer,as well as Renee' Zelweger as Braddock's wife,the very fabric and drive of his will to succeed.All together,with an excelent plot/screenplay and great directing yet again by Ron Howard this is a film you should not miss,and is well worth owning.This is an oscar contender,and I wouldn't be surprised if it even takes home a few at the same time.Paul Giammatti for sure will get a nomination,if not win a supporting actor oscar,as well as Russel Crowe not managing to get a nomination himself and Ron Howard for directing.For a great "feel good" movie,you can't loose on Cindarella man,and this movie litterally K.O's most other competion.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>People who say that Ron Howard stops himself from "oversentimentalizing" the story of James Braddock are just plain blind.  What about that scene in which Renee Zellweger listens to the radio blow by blow account of her husband's fight with Max Baer?  I haven't seen such wounded, assaulted innocence since Richard Barthlemess menaced Lillian Gish in DW Griffith's BROKEN BLOSSOMS.  Zellweger's face is photographed in such shadow (lensed through what seems to be a hole in the basement) that pretty much all you see is her dark tearful eyes and her pasty white hand covering her mouth in horror.  The radio reports another blow to Russell Crowe, and her eyes bulge out even further.<br /><br />I say the sheer dowdiness of her outfits is a sort of sentimentality.  OK, I know it's supposed to be the Depression.<br /><br />How about the scene where all the poor Catholic people of Bergen are gathered in the church to pray for Braddock's success against Max Baer?  The priest drags in an enormous radio, the kind that mimics the shape of a cathedral, and turns it on fullblast between the chancel and the nave, and the congregation smiles in bliss.  Later, when the fight increases in savagery, the priest is seen in silhouette, pretending he's Braddock, going one two with his upper left like he's attacking an invisble punching bag.  This is the equivalent of cutting to a dog to show the dog's amazed reaction.  It's supposed to be cute.  Back in the day, directors used to cut to little RON HOWARD's face to cue us about how we're supposed to feel.  Now he turns the tables, the real Cinderella Man.<br /><br />The movie is a little thin, and could have used a subplot perhaps to distract us from its inevitably grand progression.  There was that one subplot about Mike Wilson, the fiery socialist who tried to organize Hooverville, but I don't think one person in the audience was interested in him or his plight, do you?  Maybe the actor playing him wasn't talented enough, but I think the fault lay really in not developing the story very much.  Ken Loach might have told it well, not Ron Howard.</p></br><a href="../users/AOYTQFRLD8VLP.html">AOYTQFRLD8VLP</a><br/><p>Amid a world of gray and umber colored shadows that perfectly symbolize the bleakness of the Great Depression, Ron Howard brings viewers the light of Hope in the story of boxer, Jim Braddock.<br />  Russell Crowe plays this emblem of the Greatest Generation with grace, dignity, and an understated bravura. The first few moments of the film show his defeat of Tuffy Griffith(Thomasz Kurzydlowski)and the prosperous life that the "Bulldog of Bergen" shares with his devoted wife, Mae (Renee Zellweger) and their three children at the end of the 1920s, and then as the camera slowly pans across a dresser top with an abundance of possessions, the screen fades to black, and we see a dresser top with a few meager possessions in a dimly lit room, the stark reality of the Depression's impact on the Braddock family descends on viewers.<br /> Having lost his money through bad investments, by 1933, he and his family are living in a tenement house where Braddock sacrifices his only daily meal to feed his daughter, and the fear of being sent to live with relatives due to parental inability to feed him--which was the fate of a close friend-- drives young Jay Braddock to steal a salami from the butcher. Braddock Sr. disciplines his son and promises him that he will not send him away.<br /> After breaking his right hand in a fight against Abraham Feldman(Dave Litzinger) at Mount Vernon, Braddock is decommissioned and the level of despair increases. While Jim is occasionally picked to work at the docks, he is not always chosen, and cannot earn enough to prevent the heat from being turned off . When one of their sons becomes ill, Mae, unaware of Jim's promise not to send the children away, farms them out to relatives, forcing Jim to apply for relief, and to beg associates for money to pay the heating bill. The level of despair and humiliation in his eyes is plausible.<br /> The dawn on the heels of the darkness arrives slowly. But not before we view the tension caused between friends of the Braddocks(Paddy Considine, Rosemarie DeWitt) which reveals itself even at a child's birthday party.<br /> Soon Braddock's faithful manager, Joe Gould(Paul Giamatti), who has fostered him through prosperity as well as austerity (and who barely keeps up appearances himself)is helping him return to the ring, giving him the successful opportunity to defeat Corn Griffin(Art Binkowski), and later, John Henry Lewis (Troy Amos-Ross)and Art Lasky(Mark Simmons). In the last of those three fights, nothing symbolizes Braddock's determination more than his picking up his toothguard and putting it back in his mouth after receiving Lasky's most effective punch, amid thoughts of his family and money troubles.<br /> There is a lovely scene where, after repaying his relief money, he presents his wife with roses. But soon it is overshadowed by the tragedy of a good man wasted by trying times.<br /> Crowe's role in this movie touches on others that he's played.-- His defense of a woman from possible violence, and his playing to the crowd for the love of his family are highly reminiscent of "L.A. Confidential", "Mystery, Alaska" ,and "Gladiator" combined.It seems a matter of course that an actor with his physical build would eventually play a boxer.  He captures Braddock's heart, spirit, and sinew magnificently, glistening with sweat as he takes on each opponent. He rises like a phoenix from the ashes of poverty and despair, and inspires many.<br /> The film reaches its climax when Braddock is slated to fight Max Baer(Craig Bierko), and Mae's tension hits the heights when she sees her husband, seemingly unconcerned about Baer's having killed two men in the ring, sparing in jest with the children.<br /> The only serious flaw of this film is in the portrayal of Baer's cockiness over killing two opponents, when in fact, he was deeply remorseful about it and even paid for the education of the children of one of his victims.<br /> But the end game is truly a fanfare for the Common Man, and overall, Howard has sung adequate homage to the sweetness of the American Dream, and done great justice to the pluck and determination of the Braddocks, whose virtues of faith, rescoursefulness, and support of those closest to them should be emulated by us all.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>There seems to be a lot of boxing films around lately, and that's why I was reluctant to see Cinderella Man, but it was recommended so highly by some young cousins that I just had to see what all those accolades were about.  Well, I must say I was impressed.  This film seems to have it all, and I was completely entranced throughout its 2 hours and 25 minutes.<br /><br />Yes, this film has star power.  There's Ron Howard directing and here's Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger and Paul Giamatti in the leads.  But most of all, the story is great.  Cinderella Man is based on the life of boxer Jim Braddock, who was riding high in the late 1920s.  We first see him as a family man, rushing home after a big win with money in his pocket to his loving wife and family.  But then Jim breaks his right hand and loses a lot of bouts.  By now, it's the depression and his family is living in poverty in a run-down basement apartment.  Jim loses his license to fight and has to work on the docks.  These dock jobs are few and far between though and every day Jim goes to a lineup where men are selected for one day's work.  Jim has a broken hand but he works anyway.  It is the only way to feed his family.  There's little to eat in the Braddock household but when his young son steals a salami from the butcher, Jim makes the child return it.  Soon, the family's electricity is turned off.  There is no heat either.  And the children are sick.  Jim has to beg money from his former colleagues.  Jim is pathetic now.  Things look bad.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti, who plays his fight manager, manages to get Jim one more fight.  It's a tough fight but Jim wins.  Then Jim keeps winning.  Eventually, he has to fight the dreaded Max Baer, played with excellent bad-guy acting by Craig Bierko.  The rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />In addition to the story, the film really captures the depression era of the 1930s.  We feel this by the skillful crafting of many little human dramas.  It is very real, with the one exception of Ms. Zellweger's wardrobe.  Her clothes are just too clean, the fabrics too high-quality, and the design a little too upscale for this family who live in such dire need.  But after all, this is what American film making is about.  Also, these days, American film making is not always shot in America.  Cinderella Man was shot in Canada.<br /><br />To sum up, in spite of its minor shortcomings, this film is wonderful.  We all need an inspiring story right now.  Russell Crowe plays Jim Braddock as a man to admire and emulate.  Hooray for him and for everyone else connected to the film!  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A39NS429FYXAD1.html">A39NS429FYXAD1</a><br/><p>Although previously unfamiliar with Braddock's story and not a boxing fan, I was greatly moved by this wonderful drama.  Russell Crowe plays Jim Braddocok with such heartfelt integrity that it is impossible not to be swept up in his story and you will root for him from start to finish.  The boxing sequences are worth nothing for their artistry, as well.<br /><br />Giamatti and Zellweger both turn in earnest supporting performances but still pale alongside the great Crowe.  The 3 children, while not called upon for much ability, manage to pull at the audience heartstrings and an Honorable Mention to the always reliable Craig Bierko for delivering far more dimension to the role of Max Baer than was written.<br /><br />Solid special features enhance this DVD and make it one you will be glad to own.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>Before I start with my review, I'd like to highlight five things that made 2005's Cinderella Man the film that is,<br /><br />1. DIRECTION<br />I havent been following Ron Howard's filmography but Cinderella Man is one film that catches you just when you're least expecting. Every scene in the film has a certain bit of life that leads to the climax of the film. I don't know what this man was thinking considering I never heard of Braddock before this movie. I don't think every director would dare to mingle with a story like Cinderella Man especially since it's so difficult to recreate the past and instill in the actors and their eyes the feeling of utter life induced irony. The Camerawork is astonishing most of the times and the language of the film has the kind of subtlety that classics do. This is the kind of film that brings out the yearn in me to aspire to become a film-maker<br /><br />2. THOMAS NEWMAN's Timeless Score<br />I used to think there is no man in the world that can make a score that can add to a film's divinity and sanctity like Thomas Newman can. After watching Cinderella Man, I have nothing but absolute respect for his ability to bring out melodies that recreate a time several decades back. I would actually go as far as saying that the score of Cinderella Man outdoes his previous work(Road To Perdition) The ambient instrumenal music adds to the impact the snow creates. It's ideal winter music.<br /><br />3.CASTING<br />I notice that throughout the length of the film there was a major spot missing. There is no firm spot for Supporting Actor. You'd think Russel Crowe would have someone to take care of his back but besides his half absent manager there is noone in the film that really sympathises with him. I found this queer,strange and very interesting. Russel Crowe alone carries this epic with very mature flawless performances by Renee Zewellger and the kids. 10/10 for casting really. If I could use one word for the music of this film, I'd say "UNBELEIVABLE"<br /><br />4. IMPACT<br />Although I never wept during this film, it arose a very staunch emotion and some scenes made me skip a few heartbeats. RAGING BULL was a film that I liked but it was flawed owing to overdramatic and conscious ending.Cinderella Man is confident,disquieting and unbelievable at times. Those scenes where Russel Crowe smiles at the punches being delivered to him,the scene where Renee Zewellger throws wine on his husbands opponent's face and the scene when his young son steals ham from the butcher and later cries in his father's arms were simply disquieting.<br /><br />5.CAMERAWORK<br />For this, you'll simply have to watch the film cause my comprehension fails me here.<br /><br />Now, I think that pretty much sums up this film. I only wish I had scene it in the theater though. What is also strange is how I never really respected Russel Crowe. I know he's an excellent actor but in Cinderella Man, I truly think I came over my juvenile dislike for him. He is as complete an actor as they come.<br /><br />Films I think you should watch if you liked Cinderella Man include,ROAD TO PERDITION and THE BASKETBALL DIARIES.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>I understood recently why movies about boxing get so popular. Because boxing is very similar to life and in such a story you can tell everything: about rises and falls, about joy and grief, about overcoming pain and dificulties, about personal courage and spirit. Boxing is a perfect metaphor for life. I think "Cinderella Man" is the third great boxing film in history along with "Raging Bull" and "Million Dollar Baby". It tells the real life story of James Braddock, a man of boundless bravery and big heart, who once rose from ashes like phoenix and proved to everyone and what's more importand - to himself, that everything's possible if you really want it.<br /><br />This is a truly rigorous and at the same time very sensitive story about life full of disappointment, hard times, devotion, overcoming and, finally, victories.<br /><br />Russel Crowe did an amazing job here, to my opinion this is his best part to date. A really wonderful movie for everybody, even for women who don't like boxing flicks mostly. I also had a prejudice about "Cinderella Man" thinking it'd be another dull boxing movie. But that was only before I actually watched it.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Well, you may not this guy, but you have to admit he can act.  Yes, I'm talking about Russell Crowe, star of 'Cinderella Man.' And the film's results at this summer's box-office must be  disappointing to the studios (Touchstone, Universal, Miramax and Imagine), for it barely exceeded $60 million. Here's another reason you don't see this film.<br /><br />In fact, 'Cinderella Man' is a well-made film about a boxer Jim Braddock who lived a life during the 1930s in America.  Though the script of Cliff Hollingworth and Akiva Goldsman is nothing but a familiar 'dreams-come-true' type of story, the good acting and production designs raises the film several rank higher than where it might have been.<br /><br />Like another Depression-era film 'Seabiscuit,' Jim Braddock got everything, lost it, and came back to get it again.  During the Depression, Braddock, formerly young promising boxer, is now trying to get a job at the dock.  No longer able to fight because of his broken fists, and having caring wife and three kids at home, Jim needed money.  At one time, he goes not only to Public Relief, but also to the promoters who once decomissioned him, and literally begs for money.<br /><br />But thanks to his faithful trainer Joe Gould, who convinced the promoter to give him another chance, Jim Braddock returns to the ring.  Everyone thought he would lose; Joe might be thinking as anyone else, like 'This is going to be his last bout."  Maybe Jim himself thought that way.  Contrary to their lowest expectation, however, Jim wins.  You know, sometimes strange things happen in the history of sports, like last year's Major League Baseball.  And in Jim's case, he becomes Cinderella Man, a national celebrity and hero of the time when many people just stopped dreaming.<br /><br />The producers of 'Cinderella Man' should be grateful to the actors, especially Russell Crowe as Jim Braddock and Paul Giamatti as Joe Gould.  Their acting are both rivetting in a different way; Crowe presenting a convincing portrait of fierce (and often desperate) fighter and loving father, and Giamatti a glib manager whose glibness cannot hide his humanity.  And special mention to Craig Bierko, heavy weight champ 'Max Baer'  who killed two boxers on the ring, and can smile and brag his power.<br /><br />Ron Howard tends to include too many things in his film, losing the blance of the entire film, and he doesn't change.  The film runs as long as 2h 24mins, but the length is no problem here with a good story and acting.  Still, Renee Zellweger as Jim's wife Mae Braddock is far from satisfactory, not required to do much (and why Renee Zellweger?  She is miscast, I am afraid).  Worse is the role of Mike (played by Paddy Considine, 'In America') of whose presence gives little impact to the story.  His character and the friendship with Jim is awfully underwritten.<br /><br />But the worst part of the film is, if I have to point out, is its title.  Even though the name is historicaly correct as Jim Braddock's alias, the name, when used with a film released during the summer season, sounds like a comedy starring Will Ferrell (I confess. I really thought so at first).<br /><br />As a film 'Cinderella Man' has flaws, but the actors are certainly Oscar worthy.  And it is a good example to prove that a good story well told never fails to move us.  Even though it was told many times before.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D9IEFJGB483Q.html">A2D9IEFJGB483Q</a><br/><p>Among thespians there is a tradition and superstition around the play Macbeth.  IT is simple referred to as "The Scottish Play."  This film needs a similar tradition.  From hereon out, I decree that this film shall be called "The Russell Crowe Boxing Movie."<br /><br />Except for the title, there is nothing wrong whatsoever with this film. It is the perfect feel-good movie.  It is not only about Braddock taking on the boxing ring and the Depression, but we are also treated to his wife point of view.  Aussie Russell Crow glides easily into the Irish accent, and Zellwegger manages to talk like Betty Boop throughout the movie.<br /><br />Howard gives you a feel not only for Braddock's struggle, but also for the devastating impact of the Depression on many people. The power outages, the past-due bills, and the watering down milk for the kids.  He should get an Oscar just for his accurate portrayal of the era.<br /><br />I think Howard has finally come to his own and found his voice as a director.  It is not the front-view boxing images, but that quick flash of the X-ray when Braddock cracks his ribs.  Genius!<br /><br />I give this film Six stars, and take away one star for letting the odd title in the films. It is not a major part of the movies (it is mention twice), and sounds too much like Jerry Lewis's Cinderfella.  Rename and re-release this film!</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>If Rocky had lived in Depression Era New York, he'd have been James J. Braddock, the hero of "Cinderella Man," based on the unlikely comeback of the small heavyweight whose career was left for dead, then reclaimed. "Rocky" seems to have inspired this movie, despite it being based on a true story - specifically in the depiction of the heavyweight champion at the time, Max Baer. Director Ron Howard is aiming for Oscars - the movie's too simple and handsome for that. But it is a winner, and the boxing scenes are suprisingly lucid and fierce.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is Braddock, a flinty, good-natured Irishman who lost his boxing winnings in the Depression and was reduced to a one-room apartment and the daily 5 a.m. walk to the docks for a handful of shifts. Some days you get picked, some days you don't, and when the state of New York revokes his boxing license for, in essence, being a tomato can, poverty zeroes in on him, his wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) and their three kids.<br /><br />Abject poverty is dark, cold, long, boring, humbling and quiet.  Howard directs the scenes inside the apartment like a one-act play; it's about the most restraint he's ever shown in his career. The same goes for a possible tearjerker inside the trainer's club at Madison Square Garden, where Braddock, broke, holds out his hat for dollar bills. Begging is like the docks. Some give. Some don't.<br /><br />The second - and better - half of "Cinderella Man" charts Braddock's comeback, which begins with a one-fight farewell against heavyweight contender Corn Griffin. Braddock has switched styles - he suddenly has a left hook - and he uses his decent speed to get inside his larger opponents and go to work. They're some of the best boxing scenes ever filmed, both in visceral impact and intellectual depth - a strength is to use Braddock's trainer (Paul Giamatti, in a role that suits his extroverted nature) as a means of bluntly explaining fight strategy - "fill his face with blood" -  in a way that stirs us while deepening our understanding of the ring.<br /><br />This is rare - consider Rocky's various trainers speak mostly "go get em" nonsense, little-to-nothing is said in "Ali," and "Million Dollar Baby" isn't really about boxing anyway. When Braddock finally fights Baer(Craig Bierko), we understand why Baer is fearsome, how Braddock beats him, and how titanic a victory it was to outpoint the guy over 15 rounds. Surely Baer is not quite the talky villain the movie makes him out to be - this is where "Rocky" seems to be the influence - and the fight includes about 200 more landed punches than there actually was, but this is surely more exciting than the climactic fight in "Ali," if not as artistic.<br /><br />"Cinderella Man" is not quite as dramatic in its smaller moments - in one of those "the way it was" subplots, it attempts to articulate the anger of the Depression through one of Braddock's dock buddies (Paddy Considine), a mouthy stock-broker-turned-union-man. It's just a big shoehorn. And while I'm sure Zellweger wanted to work opposite Crowe, she is cute and plucky and supportive to a fault, and has been in a bunch of roles, and it's getting a little old. Howard photographs her and the kids like dolls-as-street-urchins.<br /><br />The boxing material - even the early tomato can fight - redeems the soft spots. Much more than "Million Dollar Baby," "Cinderella Man" marinates in the romance of the sport, bloody and unforgiving as it is. At the end of Braddock's brawl with Baer, it's not just an emotional payoff, but a satisfaction - this movie knows the reward of a good</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>I saw something tonight that I have only seen in glimpses throughout my life. I saw a man fighting for more than money, more than press clippings, more than the coveted one night stand with any number of lecherous groupies. I saw a man fight for PEOPLE and the diminishing hope they had left in mid-nineteen thirties America. He fought because he was told he could not win. The result is one where you alone will have to travel to see.<br /><br />This film does not possess even a hint of contrived emotionalism. Even Thomas Newman, the composer who's pulled at our hearts with scores like The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, seems muffled a bit here, as if he too was in on the fact that you cannot add to the state of the human condition when its at its peak - as was the case with a boxer who tasted the darkness of life, but was patient enough to wait for the light. It is here where true life defeated synthetic emotionally-based fiction in the form of MILLION DOLLAR BABY. Unlike that highly rated film, Cinderella Man seems to scream, "Life CAN be great. You CAN overcome tragedy. To heck with this nihilism garbage! Don't hide away with your pie like Eastwood did in Million Dollar Baby! Raise your friggin fists and fight!"<br /><br />Well, that's what I heard as I watched this film. The voices belonged to those ever-diminishing elements like the American spirt, honor, hope, the indomitable will.  They are all here, in the form of one man and those who treated him like the light of hope itself - all when hope was needed the most. This is how stories were intended to be told. It's all the sweeter knowing this really happened, seemingly conquering Hollywood's current binge of nihilistic screenplay and shouting, "Hope still lives!"<br /><br />I highly recommend Cinderella Man to anyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>It's an odd thing: Ron Howard is undeniably a fine director, yet it's seldom that he delivers a totally satisfying movie. Howard is extremely adept technically, he knows how to keep a story moving, he has an excellent sense of humor, and his level-headed, humane approach to his material is reminiscent of the late William Wyler. But he's also a sentimentalist, averse to real tragedy, compelled to tidy up messy or overly quirky emotions and situations, both comedic and dramatic. "The Grinch Who Stole Christmas" and "Far and Away" were unmitigated disasters; "Backdraft" had superb fire scenes and a few solid performances, but also an over-reliance on ancient movie cliches. There is only one kind of script that really spurs Howard to make a masterpiece: a true-life story of complex yet admirable, courageous people who overcome adversity against overwhelming odds. (And even that is not always surefire; "A Beautiful Mind" just missed greatness because of Howard's unwillingness to face the seamier implications of John Nash's insanity and narcissism.) So Howard has only two authentic masterpieces to his credit; the first is "Apollo 13" and the second is "Cinderella Man." "Cinderella Man" speaks to all of Howard's strengths, and draws in none of his weaknesses; the story of Jim Braddock, down-on-his-luck Depression boxer who ends up World Heavyweight Champion, is a genuinely moving, uplifting story of triumph over poverty and despair. It doesn't hurt at all that Russell Crowe, an actor of genius, is rapidly becoming for Howard what Brando was for Elia Kazan. Whatever one might think of Crowe's offscreen behavior, on screen he is a nonpareil at portraying simple human decency and making it not only touching but fascinating. With Crowe, you must always watch the eyes; they and they alone tell us the desperation behind Braddock's upright moral character and constant self-sacrifice. It's the same gift Jimmy Stewart and Spencer Tracy had. (Tom Hanks--another Howard favorite--also has it.) There's a whole squadron of fine actors behind Crowe in "Cinderella Man," including Renee Zellweger, a specialist in smiling through tears and feisty courage, as Braddock's loyal wife, Mae; Paddy Considine as a mate of Braddock's who hits the skids; Bruce McGill (unrecognizable as D-Day from "National Lampoon's Animal House") as a cold-hearted fight promoter; and Craig Bierko, playing Braddock's rival Max Baer compellingly (if perhaps inaccurately) as a boastful, vindictive clown. But the real winner among the supporting actors is Paul Giamatti as Joe Gould, Braddock's fast-talking agent. Giamatti is one of the very few living actors who can match or even exceed Crowe scene for scene, and their scenes together are by far the best in the movie, better even than the meticulously staged fight scenes that Howard plays for maximum suspense. Exquisitely shot by Salvatore Totino, superbly edited by Mike Hanley and Dan Hill (who won an Oscar for editing "Apollo 13"), "Cinderella Man" is second only to "Apollo 13" among Ron Howard's films.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Populist film director, Ron Howard is always efficient and "Apollo 13" is arguably his best film to date. But that was before "Cinderella Man."<br /><br />All of Howard's films look great; have at least decent screenplays and more importantly, many exhibit Howard's deep sympathy for his characters...i.e., "A Beautiful Mind."<br /><br />In "The Cinderella Man" he deals with the almost mythical, though real, life of boxer James Braddock (Russell Crowe), born in the early 1900's and as much a hero to the depression-era public as was Seabiscuit.<br /><br />In a lot of ways this film reminded me of "Seabiscuit" in that, Gary Ross' filmed version of the Laura Hildebrand book addresses many of the same themes: the battle of good against evil, the rich against the poor, the horrible strain of the depression on the USA and the triumph of hard work and heart over the arrogance of innate talent and rampant hedonism.<br /><br />Russell Crowe plays Braddock very smartly: his Braddock is a simple man who loves his wife (a wasted Renee Zelwegger in a thankless role) and children and will do anything to make sure that their meager needs are met. There is a heartbreaking scene in which Braddock: down on his luck, basically jobless, washed-up as a boxer goes to the bar at Madison Square Garden and pleads with his old cronies for $18 so that the power in his house can be reconnected so that his family can have heat during a particularly bad winter. This scene is persuasively staged and Crowe is so touching and sad yet courageous that it brings tears to your eyes. Crowe has never been better: he brings palpable integrity to this role that cannot be faked.<br /><br />As Joe Gould, Braddock's boxing coach and manager, Paul Giamatti is also brilliant. Giamatti, free of all the smarminess and whine of "Sideways," just about walks away with this picture.<br /><br />Braddock was a hero of the people and the 35,000 people who fill Madison Square Garden for his Heavyweight title bout with Max Baer are there to support him. And their absolute silence as he enters the arena for that bout is thrilling proof of their love, devotion and reverence for Braddock, for they sense that this may be the last time they see him enter the ring...it could very possibly be Braddock's wake.<br /><br />Writing about Braddock, Damon Runyon has said: "In all the history of the boxing game, you'll find no human interest story to compare." Amen to that, Damon...Amen.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I predict Cinderella Man will get at least 5 Oscar nominations (Actor-Crowe and Supporting Actor-Giamatti are the obvious nominations) and it deserves it. Ron Howard is at the top of his game here, properly balancing the depression/family scenes and long grueling bouts in the ring. I would even say that this is my favorite film of his. Russell Crowe turns in another great performance (when does he not?) and has earned the spot as one our most gifted actors along side Johnny Depp. On par with Crowe in the performance department is the wonderful Paul Giamatti. I respected him as a hard working actor, but I wasn't a big fan until I saw him in this film. He plays the manager of Jim Braddock (Crowe) and the relationship between the two is so believable, not to mention he adds the right amount of comic relief. Renee Zellweger is someone who I am usaully not fond of, but she manages pretty good here. She is the weakest performance by far, but fits into the movie nicely. If you don't like boxing, you will still love the drama Cinderella Man has to offer. But if you are a big boxing fan like myself, you will never see more realistic fight scenes that run for minutes & minutes on end in any other film (Rocky doesn't count in the realistic department). I'm really surprised this film only garnered a PG-13 rating, with brutal fights on the level of Raging Bull. Finally, it is nice to see a prize fighter depicted as the nice guy Braddock was. Times were tough, but Jim Braddock's spirit and determination were far tougher.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>Cinderella Man, a biopic which chronicles the story of James J. Braddock, a boxer who fought Max Baer in a highly publicized title fight. Nicknamed the "Cinderella Man", Braddock became the symbol of those impoverished during difficult Depression times. Ron Howard does an effective job telling the story with the right balance of drama and mood.<br /><br />The first half of Cinderella Man moved a little slow, but I think it really captures what Depression-era life was like in the 30s. We get to see how the poor economy affected work and family life, especially Braddock, his wife and their children. People struggled to make ends meet, and had to find a way to survive. When Braddock's hand gets injured, he still has to find a way to get the job on the docks to support his family. I think director Ron Howard presented the story of Braddock with the right amount of sentimentality, not too overbearing, but just enough to make you invested in what he has gone through. When Braddock gets the opportunity to fight after suffering a hand injury, he takes this challenge. Renee Zellweger (Mae Braddock) and Russell Crowe (Jim Braddock) give fine performances, as their chemistry really works on screen.<br /><br />In the film's final moments, there is quite a build up to the fight at Madison Square Garden Bowl. This is really where Cinderella Man shines, and the symbol of Braddock's character is emphasized. Braddock represents the poor and impoverished, and goes into that title fight a huge underdog; it was a very moving and inspirational finish.<br /><br />Probably one issue with the film is how Howard presents Braddock's main challenger, Max Baer, who he presents as an opponent overbearing brutish, violent and smug person. Many have challenged this portrayal for its inaccuracies, and it does seem as though his character has been "Hollywoodized" into being the complete and total villain.<br /><br />Still, Cinderella Man is a great film, where the director manages to make a boxing film without really making a boxing film. This is a film about overcoming obstacles, about making it in a harsh world; it's really a film about life. The scenery and music score also give the film an authentic feel to its setting and times.<br /><br />The extras are worth a look, too, especially the commentary about the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>Friends had warned me that much of the first part of this film was slow and they had made the same observation of Angela's Ashes. I disagree with them about both. In Cinderella Man (a phrase attributed to Damon Runyon), it is imperative that James Braddock's circumstances and those of his family are carefully, unhurriedly established to create an appropriate context for the process by which he resumed his career as a professional fighter in 1934 and then faced Max Baer on June 13th, 1935, in Long Island City, N.Y. Although a 10-1 underdog, Braddock won the heavyweight championship of the world. (The film takes us to this point.) He would lose his heavyweight title two years later in an 8 round KO to Joe Louis, "The Brown Bomber." Braddock retired after a final win over Tommy Farr in 1938.<br /><br />Other reviewers have shared their own reasons for thinking so highly of this film. Here are mine. First, perhaps only in Raging Bull is the physicality of boxing so compellingly portrayed. Also, I admire the skills of those who recreated a period more than 70 years ago, one during which the Braddocks and millions of others struggled to overcome hunger and illness as well as poverty and especially terror and humiliation. Under Ron Howard's direction, the quality of acting is outstanding, notably Paul Giamatti as Braddock's manager and trainer, Joe Gould. (I still think that Giamatti should have at least been nominated for an Academy Award in recognition of his performance as Miles Raymond in Sideways.) With regard to Ren&eacute;e Zellweger (as Braddock's wife Mae) and Craig Bierko (as Max Baer) as well as Paddy Considine, Bruce McGill, Ron Canada, David Huband,?Linda Kash, and Nicholas Campbell, they had to work within quite specific limitations in their supporting roles. I thought they were all just fine.<br /><br />Finally, I wish to single out Russell Crowe for special praise. Whatever his public persona may be, he demonstrates exceptional self-discipline as well as nuanced talent in the lead role of the courageous heavyweight champion boxer. Braddock fought for "milk," to be sure, but in doing so became a symbol of hope for other victims of the Great Depression. Crowe brilliantly portrays Braddock's fundamental decency and integrity as well as his total devotion to the welfare of his wife and their three children. To me, this is Crowe's finest performance thus far.</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>"Cinderella Man", Ron Howard's heart-felt film biography of boxing legend James J. Braddock, never received the recognition it deserved when first released, due, in large part, to Russell Crowe's bad press following a telephone-throwing incident. Overzealous critics tended to lump the incident and film together, and despite Crowe's public apology, many moviegoers skipped it. Now that the film is available on DVD, it's time to acknowledge the film for what it always HAS been; director Howard and star Crowe's FINEST film, together!<br /><br />Braddock's story is so amazing and inspirational, that it is astonishing that it's taken seventy years to tell it. Sylvester Stallone 'borrowed' from it, extensively, in creating "Rocky", and in viewing the film, the parallels between fact and fiction are obvious; Braddock had been an 'up and comer' in the twenties, but broken bones and ill-advised matches had cost him a championship shot. Then the Depression struck, Braddock was wiped out, financially, and he struggled to support his wife and family through the most harrowing period in American history. Considered 'washed up' and too old for a comeback, all the boxer had going for him was his wife's love, his manager's faith, and his personal integrity, which refused to allow him to give up. He tenaciously climbed back up the ranks of younger title contenders, earning the adoration of a country trying to rebuild their own lives, as well, until, finally, he had his championship match, against ruthless 'killing machine' Max Baer. Their match would become the stuff of legends!<br /><br />To director Howard's credit, he never 'over-sentimentalizes' the story, or tries to turn it into a soft-focus 'fairy tale'. His vision of the Depression is the most accurate and heartbreaking since the documentaries of the '30s, and will come as a revelation to those whose only knowledge of the period is a paragraph in a history book. Jim Braddock is not a 'Superman', but a hard-working, decent man with no higher vision than to provide his family a better life, and as magnificently portrayed by Crowe, he embodies qualities of honesty and dignity that many of us dream of, but seldom achieve. In any other year, he'd be a shoo-in for an Oscar for his performance, it's that good!<br /><br />Matching Crowe's portrayal are Ren&eacute;e Zellweger, as his loyal wife, Mae, who perfectly channels a '30s 'style', as well as a gutsiness that is timeless, and the wonderful Paul Giamatti, as manager Joe Gould, who would sell everything he owned, rather than see Braddock give up. Giamatti, a veteran character actor who finally saw his 'breakthrough' in last year's "Sideways", should finally get his long-deserved Oscar, for this role.<br /><br />"Cinderella Man" is a film that will continue to be cherished long after the filmmakers are gone, a tale rooted in an earlier era, but still timeless.<br /><br />Movies just don't get better than this!</p></br><a href="../users/A1C2P5HX5RLPAX.html">A1C2P5HX5RLPAX</a><br/><p>I thoroughly enjoyed this story about a noble underdog from New Jersey who re-establishes his reign in the world of boxing after succumbing to the woes of the Great Depression. Russell Crowe always does well in strong character roles with a physical component and this is no exception. It took a bit for me to warm up to Ren&eacute;e Zellweger in the role of Mae, James Braddock's (the Cinderella Man) wife but she was really brilliant and brought me to tears numerous times. Loved her accent. The fighting scenes were intense and wonderfully shot. I especially liked how they transposed an x-ray view into a couple of them when wrists, ribs and noses were broken.

Braddock in this true story, "Cinderella Man" (2005). Renee Zellweger plays his loving and faithful wife. Despite economic hardships, he never succumbed to booze, other women, or criminality. There's was a picture-perfect marriage though one battered by poverty, and many moviegoers will find that a refreshing change to the usual Hollywood depiction of marriages. Paul Giamatti turns in his usual brilliant acting as the manager-trainer. All of the minor characters are excellent.<br />The misery of Irish families living in squalor and poverty as shown in "Angela's Ashes" were brought vividly back to life in certain Depression scenes in "Cinderella Man" when a proud and determined James J. Braddock was fighting to stave off the desperation of poverty. What a different man he was than the husband in "Angela's Ashes" who was a weak man who sought consolation in alcohol.<br /> Braddock has great pride; it was against his principles to accept charity, but when his three children were suffering the cold and hunger, he bites his lip and passes the hat and also goes to social services. In his fighting comeback he becomes the great hero of the working Irish. His title fight with Max Baer (depicted as a monster and dirty fighter) is of epic proportions. The boxing scenes are handled very well (I just wish they had been shorter and been edited down more in the film.)<br /> Braddock, after breaking his hand and working as a stevedore on the docks, got a second chance as a boxer. It's an underdog success story, and is a well-constructed and well-performed effort. Though it has some of the clich&eacute;s of the boxing movie genre, it surmounts these and keeps the audience involved and committed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q.html">A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q</a><br/><p>Russell Crowe stars as boxing champ Jim Braddock in Cinderella Man.

Braddock, the rags-to-riches-to-rags-to-riches heavyweight world boxing champion of the mid-1930s is among Russell Crowe's finest work. A real Horatio Alger story full of inspiration and good old fashioned values, CINDERELLA MAN is full of fine performances, especially those by Renee Zellweger (as Mae, Jim Braddock's Wife) and Paul Giamatti (as Jim's Manager/Trainer/Promoter/Friend Joe Gould).<br /><br />When the story opens in 1928, Jim is climbing quickly to the top of the boxing world. But physical injuries stall his career. Unable to box, Jim and his family have no choice but to face the full rigors of the Great Depression. He cannot find any more than shift work for pennies. A proud man, Jim at first refuses to go on the dole, but circumstances force it. Jim is humbled.<br /><br />Director Ron Howard's phenomenal presentation of Depression Era life in a northeastern winter is poignant and troubling, especially in these awful economic times of 2010. The power of the performances as the quietly stubborn Mae refuses to give in to complete despair and Jim refuses utterly to abandon hope in the face of nightmarish living conditions and breadlines, are both emotionally moving.<br /><br />Joe Gould, who has quietly lost everything as well, comes to Jim with a fight, as a "throwaway" against the Number Two-ranked boxer for a small fee, which Jim, shockingly, wins handily.<br /><br />Jim begins a steady climb to the top again, becoming the hero of the "little guy" along the way. At the very top, he is matched against the famed World Champion Max Baer, a colorful, Hollywoodish man who has accidentally killed men in the ring. He beats Baer by Decision.<br /><br />CINDERELLA MAN errs in portraying Baer as a monstrous, ill-mannered man who taunts Jim about Mae and sets out to cripple him during the fight. Baer was a big, tough man, and he was no periwinkle; but nowhere but here has he been caricatured as a homicidal maniac. Every heroic film needs a bad guy, but Baer was not, in truth, an evil guy.<br /><br />Except for this unfortunate bit of misreportage which costs it points, CINDERELLA MAN is a pleasure to watch. A paean to hope, love and family, it is a film in the good old fashioned vein, a story of adversities overcome and dreams realized, a film that restores its audience.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>I liked this film a lot and was prepared to give it five stars.  Then, wondering why anyone would only give it one, I read those reviews.  Apparently Ron Howard really murdered the character of Max Baer and for that I reluctantly have to subtract a star.  I think he could have made just as good a film without demonizing Baer.  Braddock's opponent was not really a person, but his own past, and the circumstances of the depression.<br /><br />Well, I didn't know any of that when I saw the film so my enjoyment of it was unspoiled!  Actually I had never heard of Braddock, not being a fight fan, and I didn't even know that this was true story until the name of Baer came up, as I had heard of him.  It's the best way to see such a film cuz I didn't know how it was going to end!  Well, that's not really true, either, because just looking at the DVD cover and reading the title, you pretty much can tell the whole story.  In fact I started the film, then stopped it at the point where he broke his wrist again (ouch!) and wasn't going to see the rest.<br /><br />It was only the acting of Russell Crowe that got me to finish it.  I think he is a remarkable actor---not given enough credit.  He reminds me a lot of Richard Burton--the stocky build and that wonderful deep voice.  I think he's actually better than Burton, more on a par with Brando.  His facial expressions in this film are something to behold---the carefree playful self, loosely bobbing around the ring in victory, to the deep pain in so many of the other scenes.  The scene in which he swallows his pride and goes, begging to the dressed up swells in the boxing club, is tremendously moving.  Crowe underplays it which adds to the impact.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti is wonderful, too, as Braddock's coach.  It's a stock character and could have come across as a cartoon, but Giamatti embues it with such energy that you have to love him.  This is a wonderful actor and I'm really glad to see that he's had some bigger roles and gotten such good recognition recently.<br /><br />I wasn't thrilled with Renee Zelwegger's performance.  As another reviewer wrote, she sounds a lot like Betty Boop in her attempt at a Jersy accent, and her facial expressions sometimes are off-putting, but mostly she holds her own with the heavyweight (in every sense of the word) Crowe and for a few moments I forgot it was Renee up there, acting, and actually saw her as Mae Braddock.<br /><br />I guess, in sum, it is a Hollywood version of reality and that has its limitations.  But once you accept that this isn't really history and can let yourself enjoy the humanity of the story, you will probably really like this film.  Another reviewer complained that we have too many tales of people overcoming terrible situations, but I submit that we don't have enough.  We all have our set of problems and seeing one person overcome his with honor and dignity is tremendously inspiring. This isn't just about a man winning a boxing match.  It's about a man whose love for his family drives him to make incredible sacrifices. It's also about the Great Depression and how this one man rallied hope for countless people who were suffering.<br /><br />For all of his possible faults as a film maker, Howard isn't afraid of genuine heartfulness and for that I greatly appreciate him.  We live in a time when cynicism is fashionable and any attempt at portraying honest human goodness is dismissed by some as hokey (read some of the one star comments) so it takes a certain courage to show this kind of story.  Obviously from reading the huge number of positive reviews, it strikes a chord with a lot of folks.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>with stupid, obvious humor so the kids, (& slow adults) get it.<br />But not this one. It's simply great. Adult enough yet it won't corrupt the kids. It's a long movie but doesn't seem long. As a director, Ron Howard rarely takes risks & he doesn't in Cinderella Man,  but still scores. Both stars, Russell Crowe & Renne Zellwegger wanted to do this. It wasn't just another job. Crowe might be the best actor of our time & is simply very believable as the humble, honorable, boxer, James Braddock. Renne Zellwegger is hot as his wife Mae. But she is not here for that. They are a loyal couple, in love & have three young kids. They are good people & excellent parents. Paul Giamatti does anther great turn as Jim's  agent, who never turns his back on his best friend. Crowe has several tender scenes with his little girl & little boy. These are done without schmaltz or self consciousness. That's acting. Howard gives us a good feel for the great depression that engulfed America. He captures the despair of the millions of people it ruined & beat down. The Braddock's were among these yet they had been prosperous in Jim's sucessful career. The depression came & Jim busted up his hand. He was just another, old broken down pug. He gets a second chance & rides it to the top. It's a love story about a committed couple, sticking out the bad times together. It's about their loyalty to each other & the loyalty of Joe, the agent & friend who never stopped believing. The only sour note was the treatment of Max Baer, the champ, Braddock beat. By all accounts, the portrayl as  a sadistic brute who enjoyed hurting his opponents (two died in the ring with him) was not true. License was taken because the film needed a villan. This movie is recommended for all. Also recommended are the extra on the dvd. Deleted scenes were shown with commentary on why they were not used by Ron Howard. This was very good & highlighted the fact that this was a well edited film.

Set during the early years of the Depression, Braddock (Russell Crowe) struggles to keep his family warm and fed and together while fighting for $50 a match and working as a dock hand loading ships. This film has that same feel-good aspect about it that SEABISCUIT does. What is amazing is that in 2005, a year berift of hardly any good movies, CINDERELLA MAN wasn't nominated for best film. Of the films that were nominated, I have seen CRASH but have only read about the others. CRASH is a well-made but depressing movie that puts a negative spin on race relations in the US. CINDERELLA MAN, on the other hand, extolls such values as family, hard work and reluctance to take a handout from the government. It is basically the story of what anyone can do who believes in himself or herself in this country and who is willing to work hard enough and sacrifice. Maybe this message was not negative enough for Oscar voters but it gets my vote as best picture of the year. The fight scenes are brilliantly directed by Ron Howard and Crowe and Rene Zellweger as his wife, Mae, give appropriately low-key performances of folks trying to manage in hard times, but Paul Giamatti (SIDEWAYS) steals the show as Braddock's fight agent and he deserved Best Supporting Actor for his work in this film. CINDERELLA MAN is a good family picture with a good family message and -- it really happened.</p></br><a href="../users/AURZ4YQ270W3T.html">AURZ4YQ270W3T</a><br/><p>Unlike many A-list directors, Ron Howard's style isn't immediately apparent when you watch his films. There's no trademark shot, no distinctive visual that grabs you and says, "hey, this is a Ron Howard movie" (unlike, say, Martin Scorsese).<br /><br />Howard's films are usually workmanlike, with a subdued, whole-grain-goodness style about them (indeed, his worst film, "How The Grinch Stole Christmas," is also his showiest). That makes Howard the perfect director for "Cinderella Man," a film about a guy who succeeds in life mainly because of his honesty and determination.<br /><br />The guy in question is James J. Braddock (Russell Crowe), whose promising boxing career in the 1920's was cut short by injuries and bad luck, but was revived in the early 1930's by luck and sheer determination.<br /><br />Braddock is one of those people for whom work is its own reward, whether it's in the ring or on the docks of Hoboken; indeed, it's his job as a dockworker that teaches him to use his left hand properly, which made him a far stronger boxer (previously he only fought with his right).<br /><br />Braddock is a decent man who just wants to provide for his family and live with dignity (after his career is revived, and he lands a world championship bout against Max Baer, a reporter asks Braddock why he fights, and he responds, "milk"). There's nothing showy or overstated about Braddock the man, or Braddock the fighter, but his inner strength and experience with the crushing adversity of the Great Depression make him a most formidable opponent (as Baer, one of the most feared fighters in boxing history, found out).<br /><br />Braddock's comeback happens largely due to the efforts of his manager, Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), whose cocky, ebullient personality complements Braddock's natural strength perfectly. Gould is suffering the effects of the Depression himself (his fancy Manhattan apartment is empty, the contents having been sold to make ends meet), and in Braddock he sees something to believe in.<br /><br />The relationship between Braddock and Gould is the heart of the film, and both Crowe and Giamatti shine. Zellweger has some nice scenes as Braddock's wife, who fears that her husband will be killed in the ring, but curiously, her role is almost secondary to Gould's.<br /><br />The final fight sequence in the film, which pits Braddock against Baer, succeeds on an emotional level, but the editing made the action difficult to follow at times. Still, if Howard's direction doesn't "stretch the envelope" of fight sequences, it serves the story (the standard-bearer in this regard is still "Raging Bull," in my humble opinion).<br /><br />But is this movie really about pushing the envelope? Not really, and in this sense, the understated direction fits the story perfectly. This material would have been all wrong in the hands of a Spielberg or Scorsese.<br /><br />The film leaves the viewer satisfied but not ebullient, and maybe that accounts for its rather disappointing showing at the box office (one wonders why it wasn't released in the holiday season instead of the summer).<br /><br />But "Cinderella Man" is a solid, exceptionally likeable film nonetheless.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Cinderella Man is a good historical movie, set in the great depression and based on James Braddock, a boxer who overcame all odds. He is played with great poise by Russell Crowe..and Rennee Zellwegger does a good job as his wife. Paul Giammatti is also good as his coach but sometimes is annoying.<br /><br />So the acting is good for one. The boxing is realistic and all but...I think I know why this wasn't a hit at the box office. For one because American audiences usually prefer garbage like Mr. and Mrs. Smith but also because of the timing. This movie came out a couple months (more than a couple probably) after Million Dollar Baby. And the reason I didn't want to see it for one was because I had already seen Million Dollar Baby and wasn't interested in seeing a clone set in the great depression.<br /><br />So yeah, it's a good movie with good acting but it's just not original. It's the male version of Million Dollar Baby and in all fairness, there wasn't a need for that version.

He exhibits a quiet dignity throughout the movie. Rene Z. as his wife and Giamatti as his manager are great as well. The movie also focuses on the minor characters and the milieu of the depression era. The movie brings out the despair of the country and how an over-the-hill boxer sparked hope in so many people. One of the best scenes is when the wife goes to the local parish to pray for her husband and finds the church already full of people praying for him. It sounds trite, but it works.

Braddock, directed by Ron Howard, who in my opinion is one of the better directors out there, that can take a story like the Braddock story and make it shine for the big screen!! This is a story of perserverance, strength, and family. Russell Crowe stars as James Braddock, a New York native who at one time in the 20's was  a man who ran a taxi company, and owned stocks in many companies, till the great stock market crash in 1929. Within a years time, he lost everything, ending up in soup kitchens, and falling down on his luck, till he found the love of boxing.  He used this love to make ends meet and put food on the table for his family.  In the end, he became one of the best boxers of all time, defeating the likes of Joe Lewis, and the dreaded, and dangerous Max Baer (who himself has the title of killing two men in the ring).<br /><br />A great story about love, strength, and the will to succeed!!<br /><br />Watch this movie...you will love it!!</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>As he proved with 1995's "Apollo 13", director Ron Howard has an innate capacity of taking a well-known historical event and building suspense around an inevitable outcome. That's because he is adept at developing characters that reach deeper than the facts presented in standard docudramas. This time out, he takes a well-worn leitmotif in movies, the underdog overriding the odds to become a world champion, and puts a plush, sepia-toned design to this Depression-era story about light heavyweight boxer James J. Braddock. The movie is as old-fashioned as Hollywood movies come, but Howard also seems intent on presenting an interesting period of American history that has often been overlooked in recent films.<br /><br />Starting as a contender in late 1928, he deteriorates into fighting second-rate bouts five years later until he breaks his hand, at which point he is relegated to ad hoc longshoremen jobs on the New Jersey docks. Braddock gets a chance at redemption when his former manager, Joe Gould, offers him $250 to fight a heavyweight contender. He unexpectedly confounds the bookmakers and wins, which eventually leads him to a shot at the title against the heavily-favored opponent, Max Baer. Since the main story structure is rather predictable, Howard, driven by a period-authentic script by Akiva Goldsman and Cliff Hollingsworth, focuses on the atmosphere and the effect of the Depression on families struggling to survive. For example, the details around Madison Square Garden and the "Hooverville" in Central Park feel genuine, and when Braddock hits rock bottom and begs for money from his backers, the scene has an unflinching honesty about how his humiliation has been superseded by his need to get his children back from relatives.<br /><br />It certainly helps to have Russell Crowe portray Braddock in a committed performance that would make Spencer Tracy proud. While it doesn't rank with his subtly complex work in "The Insider" or "A Beautiful Mind", his heroic performance is top-notch for this type of venture. The film's other sturdy performance comes from Paul Giamatti, who gives Joe a humanistic spirit that provides Braddock his path toward victory. I wish I could say the same for Ren&eacute;e Zellweger, who plays the June Allyson role of Braddock's wife Mae, with squinty-eyed worry and stiff upper-lip devotion, spouting the script's most sentimental lines ("You are the champion of my heart, James J. Braddock!"). It just seems like a sophomoric role for such a proven actress. Smaller roles are filled out expertly, in particular, Paddy Considine as a Communist colleague who wants to force anarchy to make the government respond to the starving masses; Bruce McGill as the mercenary promoter; and Craig Bierko - who seems to be finally graduating from his golden-boy TV-movie roles - as the boastful, menacing Baer (probably an unfair portrait but one that works within this narrative).<br /><br />It's intriguing that for all the old-fashioned drama developed toward the final bout, that the more penetrating insight in the movie comes from how the period of FDR's New Deal really did not provide a timely response to the people who faced the degradation of poverty and starvation. Braddock is shown as a symbol for the downtrodden which the administration could not fathom in resuscitating hope for people. The DVD contains an insightful audio commentary track with Howard accompanied by screenwriters Goldman and Hollingsworth, as well as deleted scenes and several featurettes about the production. The most interesting addition though is about the subject himself, "Jim Braddock: The Friends & Family Behind The Legend".</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Jim "Bulldog" Braddock (Crowe) is a figher making his way up the ranks in 1928 to become a  viable challenger for the boxing championship.  His wife Mae (Zellweger) cannot bear to watch him in the ring, and waits at home for him to return after every match.  They are happy.  Five years later, the Great Depression plagues the country.  Jim no longer is on the fast track.  He gets paid little for poor fights.  Breaking his hand ends his time in the ring, and he soon finds himself as a longshoreman.<br /><br />That job does not pay enough, and soon the electricity is cut off in their apartment, and the kids are sent to his in-laws to live.  One day, former manager Joe Gould (Giamatti) sets him up as a last minute replacement in a match with a contender.  He is expected to get pummelled, but surprises the crowd and himself with a victory.  Pretty soon he is on the fast track again, and who knows how far he will go?<br /><br />"Cinderella Man" is based on the true life story of Braddock, and is more than just a boxing movie.  I found the treatment of the Great Depression to be absolutely fascinating.  Director Ron Howard gives a very real feeling of what that era was like.  Crowe and Giamatti shine in their respective roles, and the boxing scenes are top notch.  This is a very good film that will be remembered come Oscar time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>Cinderella Man is definitely more of a feel good boxing film compared to last year's Million Dollar Baby, despite there are numerous heavy-duty tearjearking moments. Well, the first half  of the film was quite depressing, and I was instantly reminded of Angela's Ashes and In America. Ultimately, this is a good biopic and it's trying to show a man who must endure hardship and physical pain so that he can raise his kids and wife. This film is not strictly about boxing, but it's more about family value and the importance of keeping ones promises and never surrendor to the challenges of life or the opponents in the boxing ring in this case. The film concentrated on intense and gripping boxing scenes in the second half, and it's a violent and brutal experience for Russell Crowe and viewers who aren't fans of boxing to begin with.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is brilliant as Jim Braddock, a New Jersey heavy weight professional boxer, who at the top of his career during the Great Depression era was forced to retire because his injury and poor performance at his last match. Without a career, he had to take a job at the mill in order to feed his three kids and wife Mae(Renee Zellweger). When he couldn't keep up with the bills, his wife had to send the kids to her relatives homes, because the electricity was out, and it was winter time. Jim had no choice but to get welfare, and when he was still short, he had to go to his former associates to ask for change. This was quite a tearjerking moment, and Crowe was mesmerizing. At this point, Zellweger also gets to have a breakdown as a result of desperation.<br /><br />Later on, Jim's manager Joe(Paul Giamatti) managed to get him one more fight. He won the match, and eventually regain his contract. Despite the worry and discouragement from Mae to return to the ring, he was determined to improve their lives by being a boxer.<br /><br />Jim's coworker buddy Mike is played by Paddy Considine who happens to be the star of In America, and he's great at doing an American accent considered he's from the UK. Other supporting roles featured Craig Bierko as Max Baer(Jim's ultimate opponent who had beaten two men to death in the ring), and  Davinci's Quest's Nicholas Campbell played Sporty Lewis.<br /><br />I think Paul Giamatti really stole quite a few scenes, and his performance could put him in the best supporting actor's cateogory. Renee Zellweger had limited screentime, and her role is underwritten that she didn't have to show off much range like Crowe's character. Russell Crowe excels throughout the tender moments as well as the brutal fight scenes. I wonder why this film is released at this time of the year, when it's nowhere near Oscar season, considered that it's got numerous nomination potentials.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>"Cinderella Man" is the story of a down-on-his-luck guy who makes an incredible boxing comeback and wins the world title during the Depression.  What sets this apart from other underdog boxing films is the endearing and passionate performance of Russell Crowe.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is utterly convincing as Jim Braddock; his face is craggy and lined, his tired eyes reflect desperation, fear, and hope.  He is as comfortable in the brutal boxing scenes as he is in the tender moments he shares with Renee Zellweger, who plays Jim's wife, Mae.  The sentimentality never becomes maudlin, and we come to like and admire Jim for the love he has for his family and his determination to do whatever he has to do to support them.<br /><br />Two scenes define Braddock even more than the boxing matches:  The first is when he is reduced to begging, hat in hand, from his former associates.  The second is when Jim goes to the relief office and repays the money he had been given.  These scenes show he was a man of intense pride and inner strength.  "Cinderella Man" is an inspiring movie!<br /><br />Kona</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>In the brawling and magnificent Cinderella Man, Russell Crowe plays Jimmy J. Braddock, star New Jersey boxer with all the bluster and charisma that he can muster. It's an absolutely astounding performance, easily the best of the year and a guaranteed sure bet for the gold statuette for best actor.<br /><br />Director, Ron Howard unashamedly transports us to the great depression, an era of soup lines, of frayed, tattered folks just trying to survive, and makeshift shantytowns, where men were lined with the unassailable grief of living and trying to make do. It's a story of hope and survival as Braddock rises from the ashes of misfortune to become, once again, a championship boxer, reflecting the dreams of not only his family but of all working class America.<br /><br />The film opens in the 1920's when the successful Braddock is living a life of privilege with his loving wife Mae (Renee Zellweger). They have three adorable young kids and a devoted coach/manager Jake Gould (Paul Giamatti), who always looks out for them. But Braddock's descent begins fast.<br /><br />The stock market crash in the late 1920's leaves him broke; then he injures his hand in a match, and gets disqualified from the ring for slacking off. Times are tough, with the family forced to live in a basement tenement and scrounge for odd jobs. Living basically hand-to-mouth, sometimes without electricity and heat, the Braddock family hit rock bottom.<br /><br />Imbued with a kind of spiritual optimism, Braddock tries not to let poverty get to him. His love for Mae and his kids anchor him, and we see him trying to stitch together a life for his wife and children: working injured on the docks, standing in line for government benefits, and trying to scrape his way back as a boxer. Through every challenge Crowe embodies Braddock with the anguished quietude of an obstinately noble man, complete with a pitch-perfect Jersey accent.<br /><br />Suddenly Jake shows up with an opportunity that Braddock can't refuse, an offer for a one-time bout. Finally, he starts to win match after match until he's pitted against the current World Heavyweight Champion, the vicious, brutal, and cocky Max Baer (Craig Bierko). The film's final act is dedicated to this ferocious fight, which galvanized the country, and represented the ultimate triumph of the underdog.<br /><br />Clocking in at over two hours, Cinderella Man rockets along with a wild veracity, engaging and winning at every turn, and never dull. The nimbly staged fight scenes are skillfully filmed, violent but also suspenseful, sharply edited with a raw energy that pulls the viewer in. The whole film is shot beautifully with a darkened monochromatic look, a kind of washed out colour that is appropriate for the depression era story it dramatizes.<br /><br />Without resorting to melodramatic meandering, Howard weaves a tight, taught script that never falters into overt sentimentality but solidly conveys the severity of the desperation of the times. Howard has crafted an intimate, human-interest story, which also manages to encompass the emotional weight of the Great Depression.<br /><br />Braddock is a role that Russell Crowe was born to play. He instills the hero with just the right amount of tenacity and integrity and he will absolutely break your heart, from a shocking scene where it seems his heart has been torn out of his chest when he learns his children are gone; to the fighting sequences that are raw but full of humanity. Russell makes us care for this guy.<br /><br />Zellweger is also terrific as the simple yet stoic Mae, and we really feel for her dilemma when she learns that her husband will be fighting against the monstrous Baer, who has already killed two men. Paul Giamatti is another Oscar contender as Braddock's manager, crackling his lines, always concerned about Braddock, but also self-seeking and somewhat manipulative.<br /><br />There's an uncluttered clarity to these characters that befits the simplicity and courage of the man in the ring and the tough, hard-hitting times that formed him. Cinderella Man is an unflinchingly rough film, but it is also remarkably positive and life affirming, it's an astounding portrait of a man who courageously and intrepidly had the guts, bravery, and moral fiber to eventually fight back. An authentic masterpiece. Mike Leonard June 05.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KG8WLR1AKO12.html">A2KG8WLR1AKO12</a><br/><p>The establishment critics did not like this movie.  Cinderella Man was deemed to be overly sentimental and idealistic.  They prefer anti-heroes and James Braddock is supposedly too perfect.  He does not cheat on his wife, drink until collapsing in a back alley---and the almost washed up boxer is a fairly observant Roman Catholic.  How corny can you get?  In other words, Braddock gloriously represents red state values.  Director Ron Howard never even throws a bone in the direction of blue state audiences.  Cinderella Man is simply not a movie for them.<br /><br />Braddock loves America.  He owes this country everything.  Bringing down the capitalist system is not a goal.  He does not perceive himself to be a victim.  The nearly destitute father of three blames no one in particular for his financial troubles.  Is he too old to ever again box effectively?  Will his often battered body be capable of enduring further abuse?  Is Braddock's return to the ring an example of real courage or macho recklessness?  Why doesn't Braddock possess more character flaws?  Can't he occasionally show evidence of existential angst?  Didn't they stop making motion pictures like this some sixty years ago?  The fight scenes are brutal.  Cinderella Man also reveals the suffering brought about by the Great Depression.  It should be on your list of must see movies.  That is, if you are a red stater.<br /><br />David Thomson<br /><br />Flares into Darkness</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>This film didn't get a nod for the Academy Award in 2005.  The reason, many reasons, but I might sum up Liberal Hollywood's aversion to a conservative manly man, succeeding against all odds in a tough world isn't the same as two less manly men, Truman Capote, race obsessed cops, or an effeminate Transsexual whining about America run by gasp, Bush!!!!<br /><br />Those warm sepia toned 1930's are recreated for us by Ron Howard. Not much fun starving to death is there?  Yet Crowe's Braddock, an injured fighter working the docks to support his family, he doesn't cry.  He does what he has to do without stealing or sniveling.  He is forever optimistic despite all setbacks.  He is a beacon of light for his hungry family.  This is undoubtedly the Story of Seabiscuit on two legs, but because we are dealing with one of the best film actors in the world, we can empathize readily.<br /><br />Forget Rocky, CM has fine fight scenes. Sure, they are choreographed, but who cares.  We really hated Max Baer and Braddock handles the fool, no prob.  Thanks for the uplifting, Conservative message, Ron.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Russell Crowe completely devours his role in this impressive depression era biopic about boxer James Braddock.  His steely dedication to his character comes across with every minor shift of his facial expressions and impresses upon the audience a sense of pain and oppression wrapped in the warmth and appreciation that only a true master of his craft would be able to deliver.  Crowe has truly honed his craft over the past few years and has developed into arguably our finest working actor, and that's a fact I'm more than willing to argue!  Here, in one of his finest performances since his work in `The Insider' Crowe is able to transcend the screen and create a character that the audience can feel for, embrace and comfort and most importantly a character that the audience wants to embrace and comfort.  James Braddock is one of the most likable screen heroes in recent years.<br /><br />The film follows Braddock's fall from the top, a big home and a successful career till he finds himself living in destitution, relying on a prayer to get enough work throughout the week to feed his three children and keep his family warm.  Standing by his side through it all is his loving and supporting wife Mae, played by Renee Zellweger with the same effortless dedication found in Crowe.  Braddock struggles along trying to instill morals and faith in his children despite their horrible circumstances, and that's what makes this man so appealing.  When his son is caught stealing some food he still finds it important to teach his son the difference between right and wrong, making him return the food regardless of how much they could have used it.  They would survive, and they would do that with their morality in tact.<br /><br />Braddock finally gets his chance at redemption when he reteams with his former manager Joe Gould, played with fire and fervor by Oscar nominee Paul Giamatti who is just having a great breakthrough with his career lately.  Although times are hard and Braddock is far from the shape he was in while in his prime he still manages to capture the hearts of those in the community and eventual scores a fight against Max Baer, a ruthless fighter known for killing in the ring.  Mae is opposed and fearful of the outcome but James is determined to follow through and come out the victor.  The final fight is so brilliantly directed and choreographed that I'm still baffled at Howard's exclusion from the official Oscar race.  This is truly his finest film and his most effective performance behind the camera.<br /><br />The supporting cast is top notch as well.  From Craig Bierko's cocky and self-important Baer to Paddy Considine's troubled neighbor, all involved put in a good effort and elevate this film beyond the competition.  One of my favorite supporting performances of the bunch must go to Bruce McGill who just stole his scenes with his infectious anger and selfishness.  Paul Giamatti attacked his role with equal parts passion and integrity and comes off memorable and important, and Zellweger masters the entire look, feel and temperance of the era beautifully, but it's Crowe above all else who deserves the praise and recognition for his powerhouse performance.<br /><br />The uplifting and inspirational story of James Braddock will bring tears to your eyes and warm your heart as you watch this man put his family and his community before self.  Scenes where he offers his daughter his breakfast will leave you choked up and scenes where he pleads for a helping hand with his hat in his hand are especially effective and will have you balling like a baby, at least I was.  Howard and company beautifully capture the time, the place and the heart of this story and deliver one of the finest sports dramas in recent years.  `Cinderella Man' proves to be a complete and utter joy from beginning to end and a most memorable movie watching experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A1O60Q7LBN4MQ.html">A1O60Q7LBN4MQ</a><br/><p>I wasn't sure how much I would enjoy it because I'm not a fan of Russell Crowe. He's a good actor but he's such a creep in real life. Also, I'm not a fan of boxing. Yet, I tend to like boxing movies. Go figure. :^/<br /><br />Well, this movie had lots of heart. How can you not like an upstanding person that James J. Braddock was portrayed to be? He loved his family and he tries so hard to keep his family feed and off the street during the Great Depression. It was important that his family stay together. You want the man to win.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Based on the true life story of Depression Era boxer, James Braddock, Cinderella starring Russell Crowe as Braddock is a heartfelt and stunning achievment in cinematic history. Renee Zellweger plays Mae, Jim's wife, who stands by him no matter what. In the beginning, the couple and their three small children are happy, healthy, and rich but then the Great Depression strikes, their world is turned upside down. They are forced to live in a tiny apartment, they power is turned off, and one of their children is taken ill by lack of nutrition. The only reason I can't give this film 5 stars is that Cinderella Man can be slow at times, some of the boxing scenes are kind of boring but if you are a guy, of course you'll love those scenes, but overall, the film is classy, enchanting, and inspiring. Crowe and Zellweger are perfection together. Too bad this film wasn't recognized by the Academy, rent or buy this film today.</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>Cinderella Man is the Ron Howard directed movie about Jim Braddock, a depression era boxer who beat the odds to become the heavyweight champion of the world.  Russell Crowe and Rene Zellweger star as Braddock and his wife.  Braddock is an up and coming boxer before losing a fight then losing all his money in the stock market crash of 1929.<br /><br />The movie is its most powerful when portraying the hardships that Braddock must face looking for work.  Their small apartment is a dump, they have no money, and Braddock lives in fear of having to send his kids away to live with relatives.  Braddock continues to lower himself as he applies for welfare then even visits his old boxing buddies to ask for money so he can turn his heat back on.  Braddock's manager, played by Paul Giammatti, gets Braddock another fight against a contender, so Braddock reenters the ring one last time on a days notice.<br /><br />Somehow, Braddock knocks out this contender and the rest of the movie chronicles his rise to the final heavyweight championship bout with Max Baer.  The boxing is realistic and violent and one of the best scenes is after Braddock wins his comeback bout, he stands in the audience, watching Max Baer brutally pummel and taunt an opponent.  This was a good movie, and emotionally uplifting.  The boxing scenes were played for realism, I kept expecting to hear the Rocky music start playing.  Also, there is no scene where his wife inspires him to victory.<br /><br />Cinderella Man is a good movie that men and women will both enjoy.  Being a true story, you won't see the expected twists and turns, but you'll definitely enjoy the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Jim Braddock is a man who is trying his best to support his loving wife and children during the Depression.  He has reasonable success as he works himself up the boxing ladder, but eventually injuries take their toll and he is unable to pay his bills and keep the electricity on in their small apartment.  Russell Crowe does an exemplary job of depicting the humble yet relentless fighter and Renee Zellweger is his faithful and supportive wife.  Their relationship is what holds the family together during the toughest times.  She would much rather her husband earn his living in a less dangerous arena than boxing, but she does not prevent him from following his dream.  This is a touching, absorbing, and thoroughly satisfying film.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Not being a fan of boxing I usually avoid movies about the sport unless there is some other reason for watching (as in Million Dollar Baby, the initial Rocky film): the idea of watching two people beat each other bloody while crazy crowds cheer just doesn't register as entertainment (the American gladiator syndrome). And while CINDERELLA MAN is clearly about the game of boxing, the true story of a real boxer, and contains long spans of beatings, this film is not so much about boxing as it is about the indomitable human spirit.  It is also one of the finest films depicting the Great Depression in the 1930s that is a timely moment for us all to remember...<br /><br />In 1928 Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) was a top contender for boxing fame, supporting his wife Mae (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) and three children, wisely investing his earnings form his winning fights in the reliable stock market, devoting his time to his family and securing their future.  Then 1929 happened and the stock market crash destroyed his savings and damaged his ability to fight, plunging him into the mass of poverty accompanied by nearly all Americans.  Jim and Mae struggle to feed and clothe their children, and Jim is unable to win at boxing, becomes a 'loser', loses his license, and survives by daily showing up at the docks for the negligible chance of work.  The times are bleak, and there is a moment when Mae shifts the children around to family members because they have no food or heat. But Jim's fight manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), himself surviving the bad times under a hollow facade, manages to gain Jim a fight. Despite his advancing age, broken hands, fallen reputation, and challenged ego, Jim manages to sustain his spirit and fights for the survival of his family.  The rest is history.<br /><br />Ron Howard directs this story of a man's indomitable spirit with a fine sense of pacing and manages to hold this two and a half hour movie together without a moment of wasted time.  With cinematographer Salvatore Totino and musical score writer Thomas Newman  he manages to recreate the gray brown mood of the Great Depression better than any film to date.  There are small supporting roles that truly shine: the grossly underused Paddy Considine, Craig Bierko, and Bruce McGill among them are beautifully carved creations.  Russell Crowe gives his most understated, credible role and truly inhabits 'Cinderella Man' (his moniker) as a desperately needed hero of the people of the Depression Era.  Ren&eacute;e Zellweger once again plays, well...Ren&eacute;e Zellweger.  The surprising acting comes from the solid support by Paul Giamatti.  If he isn't nominated for best supporting actor then people aren't watching!<br /><br />CINDERELLA MAN is a strong film, one that sweeps you up and carries you along - even if you don't care about boxing!

During an era where boxing was the NBA-glamour sport of its time, Braddock was a promising up and coming fighter.  Not long after suffering from a damaging hand injury, the stock market crashed and so did Braddock's career.  He was eventually driven out of the ring and considered to be a wash-up.  But miracles really do happen (and not just on ice) and at the last moment, Braddock is recruited for a "one-time" appearance to fill in as a punching bag for a leading contender.  Only, the unexpected happens and the washed-up Jim Braddock wins his match.  In doing so, he captures the love of a nation and inspires its citizens during the darkest hours of the Great Depression.<br /><br />The acting performances in CINDERELLA MAN are quite remarkable.  Despite his bad-boy behavior, Russell Crowe is one of the most talented actors of the current age.  From L.A. CONFIDENTIAL to GLADIATOR and A BEAUTIFUL MIND, Crowe has displayed an almost uncanny ability to not only believable portray great characters, but make those characters appeal to the average man.  James Braddock was the Depression era Average Joe's role model and Crowe was perfectly cast for the role.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti once again returns to his roots of a supporting actor, portraying Braddock's longtime friend and manager, Joe Gould.  However, now that Giamatti has let his star shine, the light refuses to dim and his supporting role in the film turns Gould from being a supporting character to an essential role. Other mentionable performances are Renee Zellweger as Mae Braddock and Bruce McGill as boxing moneyman, Jimmy Johnston.<br /><br />Despite these fine acting performances, the movie does have some flaws.  Ron Howard can be a very talented director. However, there are times in CINDERELLA MAN where Howard chooses to go the less talented route of emotional appeal, rather than attempt something more powerful and dramatic.  For instance, building the audience up to suspect that Braddock is on the verge of leaving his family after Mae sees a man in the street walking away from his screaming wife.  The movie also has some cinematography elements that seem out of place, e.g. and overuse of shadow and an extensive use of panning.<br /><br />Nevertheless, CINDERELLA MAN is a powerful film.  In fact, other than FIELD OF DREAMS, it is the only sports movie that has made me cry.  Not only that, but the "tire-cam" that was invented during the course of the filming allowed for some of the most realistic boxing shots to appear in a movie since RAGING BULL.<br /><br />As a piece of triva,  Braddock's opponents in the ring were played by professional boxers who on occasions, accidently knocked Crowe out.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>What do I think of director Ron Howard telling ME about poverty, in depicting World Title Boxing champ James Braddock's struggle to feed and support his family during the American financial depression of the 1930s? His relentless grim picture of hungry children with bronchrial coughs in cold city tenements is like finding a razor blade in an apple off The Walton's family tree. Times are tough all over, but you gotta do what you gotta do, even if you tearfully promised your son, on word of honor, that you'd never split up the family. I think Howard wrung an emotionally soaking wet rag dry, just to set us bleeding heart saps up for the exhilerating ride to the rewarding, climactic world title boxing match. Starting off like a morality play, typical of the era, with ragged parents on snowy city streets looking for food for their family, the movie then uses the violent, blood-spitting sport of boxing as the only cultural alternative to both the hopelessness of the depression, and the cynical and maudlin voice of the media of the day. A happy ending to a dumb drama might help depression audiences cheer up a bit, but seeing a guy punch the living daylights out of an established, cocky world boxing champ, will send them out into the streets roaring with approval. Ron Howard's extravagant, artsy camera work only enhances the film; the stop action camera flashes during boxing bouts nail home the graceful strategies of boxing, Russell Crowe walking down a city street while all around him becomes a blurred image, conveys well the character's deepening isolation. The leads and supporting cast are excellent, the historic details are meticulous, blah, blah, blah, but it's the horrific edge of World Boxing Champ Max Baer, he killed some guys in the ring, played by Craig Bierko, that gives the film reason to rally around the hero and strike up a round of 'For He's A Jolly Good Fellow'.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) is at the top of his game; a good fighter, he has a real shot to become the Champion. He lives with his wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) and their three kids in a nice home in New Jersey. He puts most of his winnings into stocks and bonds. Then the Great Depression hits and he loses everything. Forced to work shifts at the dock, walk bread lines, and try to eke out a survival, he longs for an occasional fight with a purse of $50. No longer concerned about winning a title bout, he simply wants to fight to feed his children. During one of these fights, he is decommissioned, forcing the family into even more dire straits. A few years later, he gets another chance when his manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), tells him that he can fight the Number 2 contender for the title in a warm-up fight. Winning that fight, he captures the attention of the boxing world and the rest of the country.<br /><br />"Cinderella Man", directed by Ron Howard ("A Beautiful Mind") is a near great film. Howard does an outstanding job of bringing the Great Depression to life. In an early scene, we see Jim and Mae enjoying their comfortable life. The camera pans across their dresser revealing the trinkets and jewelry they own. After a few moments of black, the camera pans back across a dresser and reveals the only item left; Jim's false tooth. This is an effective method of showing us the change in their circumstances. This one image quickly and effectively shows us what most filmmakers would go to great pains to present within thirty minutes of screen time. Howard is an accomplished filmmaker and "Cinderella Man" is yet another great example of his skill.<br /><br />Working with Russell Crowe again, the two have created a film that is similar in some ways to their accomplished "A Beautiful Mind". Both films tell the story of a man who overcomes many obstacles, but the two characters are very different. As I watched the film, I was amazed at how quickly Crowe managed to make me forget I was watching him. I believed he was Jim Braddock. After the first fight, he goes home and flirts with Mae, plays with his kids and then he and Mae are sitting outside in their garden. During this scene, Crowe convinced me that Braddock was so deeply in love that if Mae ever left him, he would be a wreck. Consider that we just watched him beat the stuffing out of another boxer and then we immediately watch the same man reveal his vulnerability, yet in a very subtle, moving way. All of this just from his facial expressions. As the family struggles to make it through the Depression, their love only seems to grow stronger. Crowe does a brilliant job of portraying Braddock's skill in the ring and his love and devotion to his family, while struggling to deal with all of the hard moments in his life. It is a great performance.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti ("Sideways", "American Splendor") shows once again why he is one of the best actors working in film. His character, Joe Gould, has many different and complicated layers. He seems entirely devoted to Braddock and in other scenes there is something working under the surface that we don't quite understand. When we finally realize what this element is, it comes as a big surprise, adding yet another layer of depth to the character. Giamatti's character is complex and believable, an accomplishment for a supporting character.<br /><br />Howard always does a great job of finding great actors to fill the supporting roles, which makes his films that much stronger. In "Cinderella Man", he rounds out the cast with Craig Bierko as Max Baer, Paddy Considine ("In America") as Braddock's friend Mike Wilson, and Bruce McGill as Jimmy Johnston, the head of the Boxing League. Bierko, in particular, stands out. A veteran of many television shows, Bierko brings Baer to life. Baer was the Heavyweight Champion and a ladies man. He was a vicious fighter, killing two men in the ring. The first time we see Baer, he is in the middle of the fight and almost snorting steam out of his nostrils, like a bull, ready to fight. He knows he has to win fights to maintain his lavish lifestyle, a lifestyle that he loves and craves. Bierko does a great job of bringing the fighter to life. The performance is all the more unusual because we have never seen anything of this level from him before.<br /><br />Earlier, I mentioned that the film was `near great'. Howard creates films with an attention to detail that is very high. He makes us believe that we are watching astronauts in a spaceship or a brilliant but confused person walking through Princeton. The boxing matches benefit greatly from Howard's high level of attention to detail. During these matches, my friend seemed to feel every punch. She was saying things like "Ow", "Oh God!", and "Ouch" with almost every punch, especially during the climatic fight between Braddock and Max Baer. This is a good example of how real these matches seem. And yet another reason Howard's films are so accomplished and enjoyable.<br /><br />One thing that you can always count on is that Howard will amass a cast of highly skilled actors who will own their respective roles. In "Cinderella Man", this is accomplished with one minor exception. Renee Zellweger. Zellweger is a good actress, creating some memorable characters, and she is quite good as Mae, but she isn't as good as Crowe. In their scenes together, Zellweger portrays one emotion, one feeling, one look, while Crowe's face is revealing so many different things about Braddock. It is amazing to watch the difference. Crowe is doing a brilliant job of creating his character while Zellweger is doing a good job. It makes the relationship seem off-balance and robs the film of greatness.<br /><br />"Cinderella Man" is a near great film about a real person who stirred the passions of America at a time when they needed a hero.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>Note: In this Ron Howard movie, brother Clint Howard's traditional cameo is as a bald boxing referee!<br /><br />I'm not a Ron Howard fan, but there's little to criticize in his latest effort, "Cinderella Man". It was a thoroughly enjoyable, well-made movie. Of course, Howard was able to attract perhaps three of the best of the best to star in the film, and Americans, fresh on the heels of TV's "The Contender" and Eastwood's masterpiece, "Million Dollar Baby", seem eager to see "the sport of kings" on the screen. Boxing of this era "pulls no punches"...the visceral and brutal activities in the ring aren't softened or play-acted for effect.<br /><br />Howard is honest with his camera work; his scenes in the ring move in tense, balletic style. There's a tendency, when chronicling the life of a great boxer, to drag the film down with too many fight scenes ("Ali" comes to mind!), but Howard humanizes his hero by making the boxing a sidebar to the struggle for life by a young couple and their children in Depression-era Jersey.<br /><br />Howard uses thematic clues from the film, "Seabiscuit". His theme is how the hero worship of a down and out sports figure during a comeback could heighten the mood of the downtrodden during the scary era of the 30's. Whereas Gary Ross of Seabiscuit fame could portray the relative ease of the economic crash on the western states, Howard pitches right in to how the crisis devastate the once-mighty in the Manhattan area.<br /><br />He and writer Akiva Gold give us surprising little of early Braddock success. Usually Howard plays it pretty predictably in his films, but this time, although he shows an early Braddock win and possible star quality, he skips over one of Braddock's big successes in the 20's, his bout against light heavyweight champ Tommy Loughran in 1929, which he lost in a controversial 15 round decision. (Likewise, Howard avoids Braddock's big fight with Joe Louis, where he lost the championship in later years. The loss of the championship really does not fit the comeback theme of his film.) Instead, Howard plunges us from ringside success right into the crash that threw all of America on its heels -- and Braddock and his family move from pleasant suburbia to the squalor of just eking out a meager existence where obtaining even enough food to feed your kids is a hardship.<br /><br />Moving quickly into this tone, Howard makes us believe in his characters. Having worked with Crowe in "A Beautiful Mind", Howard wisely lets the actor call his own shots. The confident, once proud Braddock is reduced to begging for work on the docks, fighting to keep his family alive and together. Both the scenes in which Braddock has to seek Public Assistance and the one in which he goes to a Manhattan boxing club to beg for money to feed his family show Crowe at his best -- a man among men brought low by circumstance. And, during his comeback, Crowe stays true to that picture. Braddock's character truly makes you believe that Crowe had learned that his passion for boxing was nothing more than a way to keep what really matters, his family, together. Crowe plays Braddock equally well as a boxer and a man; he's equally at home in tender scenes with each of his three children, as a devoted and sexy husband to Zellweger's Mae, (perhaps Crowe's own new life with wife and child influenced how exceedingly well he could play this role!) The best of Crowe comes out, however,  as a friend and commodity to sassy trainer/promoter Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti).<br /><br />Renee Zellweger gets to roll out some of what made her so successful as Roxie in Chicago. Her odd beauty fits with the costumes and hairstyles of the day. She's torn between supporting her husband, a world-class fighter who spiraled into oblivion and then rose to the surface again. She's terrified that he won't come home from one of his brutal bouts...but then, with three children during the Depression, she's a realist about their need for money. There's a little spark about her moxie when you see how far Gould will go to avoid her haranguing him about keeping Braddock safe.<br /><br />Although all three performances of the leads were award worthy, Giamatti once again gets my vote as the sometimes droll, always entertaining Gould. As Gould, Giamatti is a scene stealer and the perfect foil for Braddock, who would otherwise be too serious. Perhaps Giamatti's finest moments are when he takes on Baer in a bout of words only while the champ fights Braddock in the ring. Crowe plays strong when surrounded by strong support, and Howard truly cast Giamatti well in this film. Perhaps Giamatti ("Sideways") won't be bypassed by Oscar THIS year.<br /><br />There are other supporting characters who truly improve the quality of the film, but no one more than Max Baer, who appears late in the film. The engaging Craig Bierko (Broadway's "The Music Man") plays Max Baer over the top as a total lout. His ability to bring this version of Baer to life should reawaken interest in the short-lived reign of the Heavyweight Champ who also happens to be the father of one of the Beverly Hillbillies. He is savage in the ring and loves his night life and swagger. You believe he's foolish enough to goad Braddock by his interest in Mae. Bierko is highly believable and larger than life.<br /><br />Two cinematic "moments" are worth mentioning - Howard puts his theme of people determining what REALLY matters to them in perspective as he films Crowe's comeback against Corn Griffin. While preparing for, and in the ring against Griffin, we see Braddock flashing back to the fight for survival and the looks on his kids' faces. This is jet fuel for the man who finally learned to use his left when he had to work on the docks with a broken right hand. Howard employs the technique of flashback well, if predictably. And Zellweger gets her chance to be reflective, as well. In an eerie scene, as Crowe goes up against Baer and Mae has to try to deal with her feelings, he flashes back to her memories of widow Sara, wife of Braddock's friend Mike, as she buried her husband Mike, and then rushed through the cemetery, scarcely believing he is gone. These two flashback sequences, although a bit contrived by Howard, clearly set the tone for the film's message.<br /><br />Howard has nothing to apologize for here. He's made an outstanding movie, skirting the shadows for what Americans love best, honor and honesty. Although this feel-good film is definitely the best of the year so far, I'd give the performances a "5" and the overall quality of the film a "4". Howard played this one a little safe -- none of Braddock's warts, none of the texture of what a man is willing to do when his family is starving, little of the greed and dishonesty of the sport, is displayed on the screen. The filming is safe and straightforward, and yes, entertaining. But Howard may have missed his chance to make a more complex piece about a man caught in desperate situation; and he may have shied away from making Giamatti's Gould the anti-hero that all promoters seem to be. Still, and all, a great effort for all concerned, right down to the music.<br /><br />By all means, go see it in theaters, it will leave you smiling.</p></br><a href="../users/A359IT81FBX64Y.html">A359IT81FBX64Y</a><br/><p>This is a wonderful movie; great story and great acting. One teensy-weensy problem though: I CAN'T STAND IT WHEN A MOVIE ABOUT REAL PEOPLE AND REAL HISTORY GRATUITOUSLY AND IRRESPONSIBLY DISTORTS THE FACTS FOR THE SAKE OF "DRAMA"! Max Baer was not anything like the evil monster depicted in this film. If his family isn't suing for defamation of character, they should be.<br /><br />Do any of you who rave about this film care about this, or is all forgiven for the sake of a good story? And don't think this travesty can be justified by the pathetic disclaimer at the end of the film about "fictionalizing some of the characters." Libel is by definition a fiction.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>"Cinderella Man" is Russell Crowe's portrayal of Depression-era boxing champion James Braddock, a sort of everyman that resumed his career in advanced age and went on to capture the championship from Max Baer, relative to the actor that played Jethro in "The Beverly Hillbillies" television series.<br /><br />I don't know if there is a Russell Crowe bandwagon out there but, if so, I've never gotten on it. I assume any film starring Crowe to be overestimed, overrated and sometimes overdone. I was surprised that this film seemed to live up to its billing, in part due to Crowe's restrained but still one dimensional performance.<br /><br />No one should confuse Crowe with the great actors of his or any other era. To my mind he is today's ultimate leading man, a latter day John Wayne for this time. He lacks the five by five ability to act a role the way Daniel Day Lewis would. Still, he ensures box office and that's why he was cast here.<br /><br />He is mightily abetted in this above average film by two co-stars -- Renee Zelwegger, Hollywood's best actress (can't say the same for her personal life decision-making!) and Paul Giamatti, who was far better in this film than his stupid role in last year's silly and overrated "Sideways". Both these actors did well filling in the gaps around Crowe's touchy feely boxer-stevedore-father-husband-good guy-everyman.<br /><br />The boxing scenes in this movie showed (still!) the influence of 1981's "Raing Bull" with extreme close ups, stop action, odd camera angles and "reality" based filming intended to help you confuse what was going on in the movie with what really goes on in a boxing ring. I read no boxing magazine's review of the action that, to me, still looked more like Hollywood than Madison Square Garden circa 1935. My wife, who takes boxing lessons, agreed.<br /><br />The plum of this film is the otherlife of the lead role and his relationship with the 1929 stock market crash, ensuing poverty, public assistance, his colleagues in the boxing industry, frineds, wife and children.<br /><br />I wish this film (which is already long at 2 hours 15 minutes) had gone further into Braddock's life to include his World War II service and life after the war. It would have given the film greater continuity in a way "Everybody's All American" showed the lifespan of the LSU football player portrayed by Dennis Quaid.<br /><br />Still, this is a pretty good flick about a guy that really existed in scenes and frames that will have you cheering for him and his family inside and outside the ring. Early Oscar buzz indicates this film may get a nomination for script or Giamatti's character. Whether that happens or not, you will probably enjoy an evening or two at home with the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>Synopsis: scrappy New Jersey heavyweight James J. Braddock begins a promising career, but due to injury and bad luck, his boxing star burns out rather quickly. During the Great Depression years later, thanks to his former manager, he has an opportunity to make an amazing comeback. Paul Giamatti was wonderful in this. He has a knack for embodying varied characters that continues to impress me. I never feel like he's putting me on. Crowe is amazing. I remember reading a Stephen King article (he writes the back page in Entertainment Weekly) that remarked that Russell Crowe almost seemed able to change his face and the shape of his head according to what role he was playing. As odd as that sounds, it is very true of his performance in this film. While his personal behavior sometimes appalls me, there is no denying that Crowe is a very talented actor. Renee Zellweger is good in this, too, making the three primary performers all really strong. The fight scenes weren't too gory, and the ultimately uplifting message of the film made it a feel-good flick for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>There are numerous problems with this film, starting with Ron Howard's being a mediocrity. His camera work, his lack of understanding of story structure, and the dearth of poetry from his films, make him a younger, balder Steven Spielberg, because only Howard rival's Spielberg's cast iron stomach for indulging sentimental drivel, and this film, like his other projects with potential (Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind), is totally castrated by Howard's inability to see life's variegations. The film that this most recalls are not fight films from that era, like Jimmy Cagney in City For Conquest nor Kirk Douglas in Champion, but Martin Scorsese's 1980 classic Raging Bull, about the life of ex-middleweight champion Jake La Motta. With one exception, where La Motta was undisciplined evil, Braddock (Russell Crowe) is shown as an All-American force for triumph over adversity. Yet, given that this tale is based in reality, the fact that it is rather unmoving, in comparison with Sylvester Stallone's 1976 film Rocky, says a lot of Howard's shortcomings as an artist, not the least of which are that the few fight scenes in the film are not nearly as good as those in the Scorsese film, although Howard does try to make the putative villain of the film, Heavyweight Champion Max Baer (Craig Bierko), look amazingly like Robert De Niro's La Motta.<br />  Now, I am no stickler for historical accuracy when it comes to dramatizations, but there are limits that this film exceeds.... The problem, though, seems to have been entirely with the creatively bankrupt trio of Crowe, Howard, and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman (who also butchered A Beautiful Mind), for in the DVD features, we get three commentary tracks, by Howard and Goldsman, which basically show how little Howard knows of narrative and how reliant he is on test screening audiences for what they like, rather than what is good (assuming he could even tell such), and how much he needs to schmooze his actors. The commentary by Goldsman shows how little of anything he has to say, but, the third track is from Cliff Hollingsworth, who knew many of the principals involved, as well the sport of boxing, and wrote the original treatment and screenplay of the film in 1995 then called The Cinderella Man, and he painstakingly details virtually every negative change the other three made to his script- not with bitterness, but the detachment of a man who's seen a living creation of his laying dead in a field. We find out that the scene of Baer finding out he was to fight Braddock was really in a restaurant, with a reporter, not in a hotel room where Baer was in a sexual threesome. What a bad man! We also find out that Braddock didn't return to his work as a stevedore the day after his first comeback fight. What a good man! I swear, that original film idea by Hollingsworth could have rivaled Raging Bull, because it seemed far more fact-based, realistic, and dramatic, with none of the tearjerker moments Howard swills in, such as the ridiculously mawkish sidestory of a fictional Braddock pal, Mike Wilson (Paddy Considine), who ends up crushed by the Depression. There is a pointless segment with Howard, and others involved in the film, sitting down to watch the last round of the Baer-Braddock fight with Norman Mailer, who pontificates and adds not a blessed thing of interest, save to stroke his ego. The other featurettes and trailers are standard issue, but I'd recommend the features just so you can hear Hollingsworth destroy the three people who destroyed his screenplay, although he does it so calmly and precisely that I doubt Howard nor the others listened to it. That Howard let the track be in the DVD has to be that he never listened to it, lest he would not have allowed Hollingsworth to detail his total lack of filmic comprehension.<br />  Yet, the truth is that Cinderella Man is a mediocre film, with one dimensionalized caricatures all around, and is only saved from trash by good cinematography and the true and great aspects of a story that even a mawkmeister like Ron Howard couldn't destroy, such as wholly undermining the climactic final bout by breaking away to show a worried Mae wringing her hands and tear ducts. Let me think- what other great film scenarios could Howard ruin? How about Moby-Dick, where Ahab sees the whale is just an animal, and lets it roam the seas in peace? Or, maybe Howard could tackle War And Peace, but stick to just the Peace side? Oh, to be back with my dad, watching that sports trivia show, when the moment ruled, and the only thing after it all was memory, not regurgitated revisionism.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This is a good example why ratings for "The Oscars" are declining and was especially low this year.  A quality film like this, beautifully photographed and wonderfully acted got ignored in favor of PC baloney.<br /><br />Building a story around someone with high moral values is apparently not something Hollywood likes to promote.<br /><br />Anyway, this may be the best boxing movie I've ever seen, and I've seen most of them.  It's an old-fashioned underdog rags-to-riches sports story about a very likable hero, heavyweight boxer James J. Braddock, played fantastically by Russell Crowe. This is another "Seabiscuit," meaning a true-life tale of longshot going up against extraordinary odds.<br /><br />More than the boxing, however, this is a great family story of a devoted husband and father and a loving, supporting wife and mother. That's the crux of this biography, more than the boxing angle. Nothing but the highest of morals and ethics are espoused by our hero here, who would starve himself rather see his children miss a meal, while teaching his kids honesty and unselfishness and doing whatever it took to take care of his family. Renee Zellweger also shines as Braddock's wife.  The two make an inspiring couple which is refreshing to see in this age of cynical film-making.<br /><br />The boxing scenes, supervised by real-life Hall Of Fame trainer Angelo Dundee, are lifelike and well-done. Crowe did a wonderful job of imitating Braddock's ring style.<br /><br />The story isn't the only thing that is entertaining. Visually, this is a wonderful treat for your eyes. Director Ron Howard really excelled in capturing the 1930s Depression era with some beautifully muted colors. The sets are fantastic and the clothing, cars, buildings, etc put you smack in the middle of the 1930s. There are great production values in this film and the DVD does it all justice with a fabulous transfer on widescreen DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>When I first saw the previews for "Cinderella Man", I wrote it out off as another "Rocky" with a more detailed historical setting.  Needless to say, I was very, very wrong.  Ron Howard is not a favorite director of mine, but he pulled it off here in spades.<br /><br />Having known only a little bit about James J. Braddock, one time Heavyweight Champion of the World and, like the unfortunate Primo Carnera before him, the first member of his particular ethnic group to win that honor, I was aware of him only as the first Irish Heavyweight Champion of the World.  They call every upset in boxing "the greatest upset in boxing history", so I wrote that one off too.  Again, I was wrong.<br /><br />Russell Crowe does a phenomenal job of playing this humble man who, when asked by the press why he fights so passionately, replies simply:"Milk".<br />Jim Braddock was not obsessed with boxing, nor was he determined to make<br />it his life's vocation: he simply loved his family and his wife, and for<br />them he was willing to take the hardest punches from some of the strongest and most ambitious contenders of his era. At this time (perhaps because of the stress of the Depression and the aimless bloodlust that ensued in most Americans), boxing was more popular than baseball and was the nation's sport.<br /><br />In the beginning of the film we see Braddock, a savvy businessman and an up and coming fighter doing very well for himself, like everyone was in those days.  He has a dedicated trainer, Joe Gould, played by Paul Giamatti.  Giamatti does a good job of portraying the fiery, all New-York manager who could talk his way into some of the most astonishing business deals and who rivalled Don King in his ability to make spectacular fights happen.  The amount of somehow good natured obscenities that run from this guy's mouth from the beginning to the end of this film only endear him more to the viewer for some peculiar reason.<br /><br />But when the Depression hits, James Braddock is just like any other man and, when things get so tight that his wife, the fantastic Renee Zellweger, has to scrounge around for pieces of wood to burn just to keep the house warm and put water in the milk because her credit is gone at the local grocery store, he works on the docks with everyone else.  Having broken his hand in three places, his response to his wife's idea for relief is to have her paint his hand black with shoe polish, to make it look like a minor burn.  He works on the docks with other men, and befriends a particularly angry man who, despite his love for his family, is determined to organize some kind of workers' strike.  In one of the most piercing scenes in the film, Braddock searches for his friend and finds him dead the shacks in Central Park.<br /><br />Braddock is all grit and good will, not even allowing his child to steal from the butcher when they are practically starving; when he finally does have to apply for government relief, his pride is so wounded that he is willing to enter the ring again as an absolute nobody, a washed up has been that everyone laughs at.  At no point is any of this saccharine or unrealistic; all the ugly emotions and the miserable chaos of poverty are shown without pulling any punches.<br /><br />His begging days are over. In an unbelievable and painful comeback, Braddock defeats the number two contender for the heavyweight crown.  Howard does a great job during the brutal fight scenes of his family running through his mind, rendering surrender impossible.  This leads, of course, to his legendary bout with the fierce Max Baer.  The film turned me off a little bit here: they completely misrepresent Baer from the beginning to the end. Portrayed as some abusive, amoral thug who seems proud of having killed two men in the ring, Craig Bierko looks like an unshaven Brendan Frazier straight of out "George of the Jungle" trying to seem scary.  Here Howard becomes unethical and downright villainous in his attempt to produce a cardboard  bad guy: Baer killed Frankie Campbell and another man in the ring, yes, and was psychologically traumatized by it.  His son, Max Baer Jr., has repeatedly stated that his father often woke up screaming at night, visions of these accidental deaths flashing through his mind. He paid for Campbell's son to go to college and never had the same killer instinct afterward.  Baer appeared in "The Harder They Fall", a famous cinematic condemnation of the sport and said several times that he hated boxing and wanted to be an actor.<br /><br />Anyway, Crowe does a fantastic job of depicting a man who had nothing and, through his own willpower and determination, rose back to the top in a dangerous sport all for the welfare of his family.  Braddock becoming World Champion is indeed the greatest boxing upset in history, I discovered after researching it a little bit: the only thing that comes close to it is the defeat of Mike Tyson by James Buster Douglas, and that had far more mitigating circumstances behind it than this fight.  All feel good BS aside, James Braddock is and always will be a hero of conscience for the American public.  A touching film.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>This is an inspiring movie based upon the life of James J. Braddock (Russell Crowe).  He was a boxer who found some success, but lost it all as the Great Depression took prosperity away from so many.  The movie shows us his love with Mae (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) amid the riches, and then quick cuts us to their poverty and struggles in even feeding their kids.  Braddock tries to keep fighting, but is injured and even loses his license to fight.  He has a had time even getting day labor work on the docks.<br /><br />Eventually, like a fairy tale, he gets a shot at a comeback and does better than anyone had hoped and eventually earns a title shot with Max Baer (Craig Bierko).  In all fairness, it must be noted that the movie treats Max Baer unfairly.  He was not the monster the movie makes him out to be.  Yes, one fighter died in the ring and another a few weeks later, but Baer was troubled by it rather than proud.  The movie does show Baer and Braddock touching gloves after the fight, but in real life, they hugged.  The DVD has an extra with footage from the real fight and shows this.  The drama of the movie just wanted a fairy tale bad guy to make Braddock's accomplishment even more wonderful.  It is just that Baer's son is still alive as are people who cared about him and it is something that has to be acknowledged.<br /><br />Probably the key point in the film is a press conference when Braddock is asked why he is doing better in his comeback than he had before.  He explains that he had been fighting hurt, had gotten some bad breaks, but that he also knew why he was fighting now.  The reporter asks him what that is.  Braddock says, "Milk".  Perfect and perfectly set up by what Ron Howard and the actors show us of the struggles during the hard years.  Anyone who has struggled in life and faced real despair can relate to this story in a deep way.<br /><br />I recommend it very much.  There is some pretty exciting fight footage that can be too much for young children, but otherwise it is a fine movie and great for kids the right age to see for its good values and lessons about family and perseverance.<br /><br />There are fine extras on the disk about the casting and making of the movie as well as more information about Braddock and Gould.  The principles in this movie are terrific, especially Crowe, Zellweger, and the fabulous Paul Giamatti as Braddock's manager and friend, Joe Gould.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>If there is any possible interpretation of this admirable saga of Jim Braddock is that you never must give up, even in the worst circumstances. Victim of the Great Depression, Braddock possessed a true steel frame of mind. He knew about his personal gifts and believed in himself as nobody else, to recover not only the World Heavy Weight Championship but his whole self stem.<br /><br />In the Thirties there were two admirable sport feats: the most famous was obviously this one and the another was the impressive triumph of Jose Capablanca in Chess.<br /><br />Ron Howard was wonderful around this dazzling handle camera. Crowe made an towering performance specially with that premonitory gaze when he saw Baer with Primo Carnera. Special applauses to Rene Zellweger and Grimanti who looked very fresh and engaging with that role.<br /><br />A winner film under any perspective you look at.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M5FI4CB6VUXF.html">A2M5FI4CB6VUXF</a><br/><p>I have to give it to Ron Howard on this one. He's made quite a wonderful and entertaining film. Now I consider myself to be quite the history buff but I'd never heard of Braddock prior to this film. After watching the movie, of course I wanted to know what part did Hollywood get wrong. Seems there's more WRONG with this movie than right.<br /><br />That having been said, this movie is still a great one. It tugs at the heart strings and teaches a great moral lesson. It's not the size of the dog in the fight. It's the size of the fight in the dog.<br /><br />If you watch this movie, enjoy it for what it is. A good movie with a great moral. If you want to learn about Jim Braddock, or any other boxer featured in the film, I highly recommend you research it through books. Even the encyclopedia.<br /><br />Do not watch this movie for factual information on J.J. Braddock or Max Baer or whomever. I can't say that enough. But the movie is well worth watching, so long as you don't put too much stock in Hollywood's respect of historical fact.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: Cinderella Man is the true story of James Braddock who watched is entire life wither away right in front of his eyes during The Great Depression.  Braddock held the reputation of never being knocked out and was at the top.  Then things began to go downhill, and the movie jumps right to that point in his life. He lives in a dark little apartment barely making ends meet.  Then things go from bad to worse when the boxing commission takes away his license after a string of bad performances and a broken hand that led one fight to be a draw. Braddock is now down at the docks where they only select 5 or 6 men to work on a dialy basis.  His house is without electricity, without heat, and his kids are getting sick.  There is a scene where his son steals a stick of salami from the butcher because he witnessed one of his friends being sent away due to the fact that his parents couldn't afford to feed their children.  In the scene after Braddock promises his son that no matter what happens, he would never send him away.  A few days later when he is out, his wife Mae does in fact send the children to her parents' house.  So now we have James Braddock as low as it gets, and this is where the movie picks up to hold true with its title.  Braddock's trainer, played to perfection by Paul Giammatti, confronts him with an offer.  After another fighter drops out, he is able to fill his shoes with Braddock for a one-time only fight for $250.  Suprisingly, Braddock knocks the wind right out of his opponent and the down hill roll becomes an uphill climb to the top.  Now Braddock must fight heavyweight champion Max Baer who has killed 2 men in the ring.  The film is very well made, Ron Howard adds a professional touch to the film and gives it an old fashioned feel.  The film does an excellent job of capturing post-depression 1930's.  There are some great transitions used that will catch your eye, and the boxing scenes are filmed with perfection.  The audience really gets into the movie, your hands and body will tense up and even your heart rate may rise because the boxing scenes are very intense.  Ron Howard made sure that the audience was not watching the boxing, but instead was part of the boxing.  The only problem with the movie that I had was that it was way too formulaic.  This movie is like any other inspirational sports story, but the fact that was made with careful precision rises the film to the top.  This movie could have been a bore, but Howard was able to really connect with the audience and that was the difference.<br /><br />ACTING: When you have a leading actor, actress, director, producer, and composer who have all won Academy Awards you know you can expect top notch filmmaking.  Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger do a fine job with their roles, nothing to complain.  They are up to par with previous performances in their history.  However, it is Paul Giammatti who stands above the rest as usual.  Giammatti portrays Braddock's manager with perfection.  Some critics believe he is the greatest character actor of all time, and I have to agree.  This man deserves an Academy Award, but I don't think he'll get one here because he's done better work.  He really deserved it for Sideways, but what are you gonna do.  I hate people who say "oh, he deserves it, just give it to him."  If the AMPAS just handed out Oscars to those that deserve it then the Oscar ceremony would lose all credibility.  Scorsese deserves an Oscar, yes, but not for Gangs of New York or The Aviator.  He's done better work than that, you can't just give them out for the hell of it.  Sorry, I'm ranting.  Overall it has excellent acting, even the kids do a good job, but the story is very formulaic, so the characters end up being formulaic too.  Aging athlete once at the top, now at the bottom, must rise and overcome obstacles.  His wife and kids are the only things that matter.  Nobody believes in him, but he rises to the occassion and becomes a hero.  Sound familiar? Sure, but the movie is still great.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  Cinderella Man is fantastic even though you can follow the plot like a road map.  I just feel that the movie was only greenlit because boxing seems to be the "thing" right now.  Million Dollar Baby just took in a boat load of Oscars including Best Picture, and The Contender is a popular thing on TV. However, it's a movie that really gets the audience emotionally involved, and those are hard to find nowdays.  The audience I saw it with gave the film a round of applause at the end, so you can see that it is a croud pleaser.  One last thing I wanted to mention, the NBC advertising within the movie hurt it quite a bit.  As you know, Universal and NBC recently merged, and this is a Universal release.  Everytime there is a news conference, or a shot of the announcer ringside, the microphones they are speaking into all have "NBC" big and bold.  They picked a white font on a film with muted colors so it stood out quite a bit. Just thought it felt a bit intrusive, and you see it in about 10-15 shots of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>In the last presidential election campaign, detractors on the left side of the political spectrum in a last ditch effort to discredit the incumbent Bush Administration honed in on what they believed was poor management on the president's part of the state of the United States economy. This of course glaringly ignored the effects of the September 11th attacks upon the stock market and the reality that the actions of the president have no direct effect, positive or negative, on the direction in which the nation's economy is heading toward. That aside however, Democrats continued to moan over the country's 5.5 percent unemployment rate, which roughly came out to eight million citizens without work. The way in which John Kerry and the rest of the DNC were selling the idea to the American public you would have thought the nation was in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, in spite of the numerous European nations, the favored sons of the left, willing to do anything for an unemployment rate like we have. How quickly it is forgotten what the Great Depression was truly like and that it was not FDR's `New Deal' but rather our involvement in World War II which brought America back from the brink.<br /><br />The story for Cinderella Man, based on the actual life events of lightweight boxing contender James J. Braddock in the midst of the Great Depression, may be tough for some people to swallow at first. True, there are quite a few notable moments of sheer clich&eacute; but this is an Oscar-bait picture after all, having originally been slanted for December 2004 prior to Crowe's should injury in training practice which would delay production, so this is hardly unanticipated. And yes, the portrayal of James Braddock, confined not merely to Crowe's engaging performance but his words and actions as dictated from the screenplay as well, reflects an almost saint-like quality about him which some may find hard to accept. But the movie's affectionate and inspirational message essentially requires the lead figure to be like this, particularly when everything which surrounds appears to collapse in front of him due to his failure as a father and a provider to his family, or else it does not make it very heralding to its audience.<br /><br />The commanding performance delivered by a rather toned-down, though still quite potently viable, Russell Crowe in the lead role of James J. Braddock, the believed down and out lightweight boxing contender who arose in the Great Depression to be an inspirational figure for the entire country on the brink of collapse. Though Crowe is likely to be remembered in cinematic history more for his fierce and combative role in Gladiator, more pastoral and emotionally charged performances in films like A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man, both with Ron Howard directing, will earn further respect, not only among his Hollywood peers but amidst the discerning public as well. Ren&eacute;e Zellweger, whose star in Hollywood has truly been rising since her breakout performance opposite Tom Cruise in Jerry Maguire with Academy Award nominated roles in the hit musical Chicago and Cold Mountain, carries the emotional baggage of the film with prodigious flare. From beginning to end, Zellweger's homey demeanor which exemplifies Mae Braddock's character thoroughly absorbs us into the emotional intensity present in the Depression-era environment of the feature film. Especially moving was the scene in which Mae steps outside to cry after tending to her sick son as her two other children watch on. This establishes that the burden created by the Great Depression fell not exclusively on the part of the husbands who had to overcome their failure to provide for their wife and children but also on the wives as well who did everything in their power to keep the household afloat only to find it was not enough.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti yet again, which in this case is far from what one would describe as a terrible thing occurring, brings a level of extraordinary brilliance to the role of Joe Gould, James Braddock's long time manager and friend, which is astonishing. Sadly Giamatti failed to capture an Oscar nomination in the Best Actor category for his critically acclaimed role in the independent comedy Sideways last year but had the film been released as originally planned he certainly would have had a legitimate shot at the Best Supporting Actor nomination for this film. He exhibits the splendid balance of levity and endearment that audiences would come to expect from a person as close to Braddock as Joe Gould was in real life. Though the Motion Picture Academy lost a tremendous amount of confidence when it brought aboard comedian Chris Rock to host the last Academy Awards presentation, they will lose even more should Giamatti not be nominated this year. Craig Bierko, a rising performer who has had few lead acting support roles such as this one, brings just the right amount of emotional intensity and loathsome anxiety to the role of Max Baer, James Braddock's opponent in the championship fight. This allows audiences to detest Baer for his spiteful behavior but at the same time admire and fear his strength. He is portrayed as a bit of a pretentious clown but a fierce and sometimes lethal opponent when he needs to be within the ring. Baer does not demonstrate this directly to the audience onscreen but several of his actions, particularly his request of Braddock to bail out of the fight, suggest an element of fear for James Braddock. This fear stems from an apprehension to relinquish the power status he has accumulated to a boxer he views as inferior and washed-up, but remains a legitimate threat to his title.<br /><br />The only genuine setback as far as casting is concerned would have to be the character of Mike Wilson, a friend James Braddock makes while working shifts on the dock, portrayed in the film by Paddy Considine. It is not necessarily the performance, which is actually quite exceptional given the limited material he had, but rather it is the analysis of the character or lack thereof. Granted, the focus of the film is on James Braddock and his triumphant return to boxing in the midst of the Depression but more time could have been spent on his relationship with Wilson or further the audience's knowledge of what he was up to. At one point in the movie he mysteriously disappears with no one knowing exactly where he is and then all of sudden, as Braddock goes in search of him in New York City, we find him lying on the ground in Central Park dying. The exact cause of his death is never fully explained, though it can be assumed that he tried to rally a communist uprising and when the police intervened he was then trampled by a horse. This felt like an absolute waste of a character, though certainly little, if any, real time was lost within the storyline from him.<br /><br />Overall, director Ron Howard's vigorous one-two deliverance of an emotionally gripping true story of Depression-era boxer James J. Braddock and Russell Crowe's competently driven performance unanimously makes Cinderella Man the single most impressive feat this year. What distinguishes Howard's vastly superior Cinderella Man dramatically from the rather deceiving quality of Million Dollar Baby, this year's Oscar winning film for Best Picture directed by the famous Clint Eastwood, is that Howard's project does not pose itself as something else. The film is not marketed exclusively for its boxing scenes only for audiences to realize upon opening that the boxing is a small integral part in the movie. It does not start off as something only to throw a sucker punch to the face and switch in the opposite direction in the last one-third of the feature. Cinderella Man portrays a simple yet meaningful message of hard-work, optimism, and the American spirit without having to force it down the throats of audience members. Advertising for these inspirational dramas set against the Great Depression, specifically Seabiscuit and Cinderella Man, attempt to portray figures such as James J. Braddock as the solitary individual who brought America out of the Depression, which is a statement neither historians would accept nor is it a message that the filmmakers intend on directly portraying. Though they can not take credit for ending the long standing economic crisis, it was the entrance into World War II following the surprise Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 CE which did that, Seabiscuit and James J. Braddock, the coined Cinderella Man, can be attributed to keeping the enduring spirit of the American people alive and promoting the `never say die' attitude which has helped this nation both in the good times and the bad. In short, hands down the best movie of the year so far is Cinderella Man with unquestionable Oscar nods going to Crowe, Giamatti, Zellweger, and Howard ... if the film can hold out long enough to be remembered after December 2005.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Cinderella Man" follows the boxing career of James J. Braddock, whom the newspapers dubbed "Cinderella Man" when he rose from abject poverty to be World Heavyweight Championship in 1935, inspiring scores of fans who were also suffering the bane of the Great Depression. Braddock (Russell Crowe) led a comfortable middle-class life in New Jersey with wife Mae (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) and their children, with a shot at the light heavyweight crown, when he lost his home and savings in the Crash of 1929 and then lost his career to injuries. Like so many Americans at the time, Jim and Mae couldn't feed their children or pay the heating bill. In 1934, a year after the Boxing Commission decommissioned him, manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) got Jim a chance to fight Corn Griffin for $250 when his opponent backed out at the last minute. No time to train. A one-shot deal. He was expected to lose. But it was Jim Braddock's only chance to earn a living, and it was the only chance he needed.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is a superb character actor who also has great presence, so he's perfect to play a star athlete. James Braddock was a modest and unassuming man, and this is a nice understated performance by Crowe. In contrast to a well-spoken, big personality like Captain Aubrey in "Master and Commander", Braddock's mindset is conveyed with few words and simple gestures. We see the contrasting personalities of Jim Braddock and arrogant, flamboyant Heavyweight Champion Max Baer (Craig Bierko), who had proven himself a killer in the ring. Some of the film's most interesting scenes concern the anxieties and politics anticipating the Baer-Braddock Championship fight. And boxing fans will enjoy the fight scenes, which often place the camera in the ring.<br /><br />Braddock became a symbol of hope to thousands of disillusioned boxing fans and New Jersey natives: A hardworking, honest Everyman who had suffered great loss and triumphed. To reflect the demoralized American psyche of the Great Depression, the backdrop against which this story is told, the cinematography is on the dark side. Indoor scenes are often shot low-key, with very little light. But I never had the impression that there was not enough light in critical areas of the frame, as is too often the case when people try to use low-key lighting with color film. Really nice work by cinematographer Salvatore Totino.<br /><br />I feel I should mention Paul Giamatti's role as manger Joe Gould, because I don't normally like Giamatti. His characters tend to be whiney and neurotic. But Gould isn't that at all and really shows what Giamatti can do if he stays away from the misfit roles. Jim Braddock's granddaughter, actress Rosemarie DeWitt, plays the Braddocks' friend Sara Wilson in the film, by the way. "Cinderella Man" is a finely crafted biopic that successfully conveys the anguish of Braddock's hardships, his gratitude at getting a second chance, and the joy so many fans felt at his triumph, which makes it a successful sports film as well. Sometimes I come away from Director Ron Howard's films feeling that he is very good at some things, but depth of emotion isn't one of them. I didn't have that impression with "Cinderella Man". This film bears Ron Howard's straightforward narrative style, but its emotions are not showy or superficial.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BEU7GPGNIG44.html">A2BEU7GPGNIG44</a><br/><p>Russell Crowe and Renee Zelwegger star in the 1930's period piece Cinderella Man. If you missed this film during it's theatrical run, it's a great drama to pick up on DVD during the holiday seasons.<br /><br />Russell Crowe stars in the film as Jim Braddock. Jim Braddock and his family are living during hard times in the early 1930's during The Great Depression. Jim is a boxer who is dealt a blow when he breaks his hand. After he breaks his hand, most everyone in his inner circle loses faith in his boxing career. Renee Zelwegger stars in the film as his wife who is doing the best she can to keep the family together. At one point, she finds herself facing an eviction from their apartment as her daughter looks on. When one of their three children gets ill, Renee's character does what any concerned mother would do. She takes her children to a better environment with other family members. Jack-furious with her decision applies for public assistance and continues his boxing dreams. Cinderella Man is one of those real period piece type of films. In the film Jack will eventually fight Max Baer. For those of you who might not know this, Max Baer is the real life father of Beverly Hillbillies star Max Baer Jr. They did an excellent job of re-creating life in the 1930's. Jack's story of struggle and triumph is inspiring also.<br /><br />The film is well over two hours long, so when you pop in the DVD, make sure you have plenty of snacks ready because it's a long one, but it's a good story. This DVD will make an excellent gift for a family member or friend who lived during that time period, or someone who enjoys boxing.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Despite using every conceiveable cliche Ron Howard's embellished for Hollywood biopic "Cinderella Man" was an important flick that was highly entertaining.  Supported by an outstanding cast, the film depicts the rise to glory of New Jersey heavyweight boxer James J. Braddock.  Braddock fabulously played by the versatile and svelte Russell Crowe was a boxer of above average skills but the determination and tenacity of a bulldog.  He served as an important symbol, a beacon of hope, to throngs of impoverished and destitute people in the throughs of the Great Depression of the late 20's and early 30's.<br /><br />The movie commences with Crowe and his wife Mae played by an accomplished Renee Zellweger,enjoying the fruits of his labor in a comfortable New Jersey home after a boxing victory.  We are quickly fast forwarded 4 years into the future where the Depression has robbed the Braddocks of their home and good fortune.  They are now living in a squalid basement flat with three children trying to keep food on the table.  Braddock's boxing career is in a swoon and he attempts to sustain his family by working on the docks of Hoboken, when there is work.<br /><br />Howard does an excellent job portraying the hopelessness and disconsolate nature of the depression as Crowe desperately tries to keep his family together.  He depicts a dilapidated shantytown or "Hooverville" erected in Central Park to shelter masses of homeless people.  Crowe's dockworker friend Mike Wilson, played by Paddy Considine, trying to save rent for his wife and child, winds up in Hooverville.  He accidently gets killed while there and is buried in a pauper's mass grave in a disturbing scene.<br /><br />Meanwhile Braddock gets his license to box revoked by smarmy boxing promoter Jimmy Johnston played nicely by Bruce McGill due to a lackluster performance on account of a broken hand.  Braddock has his $50 purse withheld and is so desperate he goes on relief to help support his family.  Eventually as a result of a herculean effort by his manager Joe Gould played by an underappreciated Paul Giamatti, Braddock gets a shot at an important fight as a last second fill in.<br /><br />He miraculously wins the fight as a heavy underdog.  This victory propels him on a series of successful fights, which are effectively filmed with harsh realism, eventually leading to a title shot with current champ Max Baer.  Baer wonderfully portrayed by Craig Bierko, was a man in possession of superb boxing skills but questionable motivation quite the opposite of Braddock.  In spite of his carousing ways and clowning antics in the ring, he was a devastating puncher who had killed two men in the ring.<br /><br />Zellweger, in a fine acting performance, is an emotional wreck, terrorized by the thought of Crowe fighting the deadly Baer fearing for his safety.  She finally relents and gives Crowe her blessing.  The stark realism of the brutality of the boxing business is revealed with some outstanding cinematography in the title match between Baer and Braddock.  The fairytale "Rocky" like ending had the theatre applauding at the conclusion of the film.  The final shot from above the ring which faded to black and white was a particularly excellent bit of film making.<br /><br />The entire cast including director Howard will undoubtedly be considered for Oscars.  Paul Giamatti, snubbed for his role in "Sideways" might very well find a gold statuette in his mitts for his role as manager Gould possibly in competition with Craig Bierko  as Baer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2INL3AYAT6325.html">A2INL3AYAT6325</a><br/><p>As a fan of Russell's for over 7 years now I was looking forward to this film.<br /><br />I was not disappointed.

If I were interested in Kodak products or finding out more information about them I would go to the appropriate place NOT in a DVD.<br /><br />The people who designed this DVD package & made this decision to input this into the DVD package INSTEAD OF INFORMATION ON THE FILM & THE DVD ITSELF, should be ashamed of themselves.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>In every boxing movie, even before Raging Bull, the observation is made that the leading man spent countless sweaty hours with trainers and actual pugilists in musty gyms, getting in shape and practicing moves so that the fight scenes would be realistic. Frankly, the fight scenes in Cinderella Man are pretty darn good. This is why boxing cognoscente were surprised when Russell Crowe, truly fearsome in Gladiator and amazing in A Beautiful Mind, (also directed by Ron Howard), selected Nestor Estrada, an unknown concierge at New York's Mercer Hotel, as his sparring partner. Estrada, whose expertise lies in securing last minute tickets to sold-out Broadway musicals, not in bobbing, weaving, and absorbing full-force blows to the face, was an unlikely choice. But Crowe is no slave to convention and virtually overnight seasoned observers of the sweet science noted that he, "Threw a mean left telephone."<br /><br />This said, Crowe does not look like a boxer. Craig Bierko, on the other hand, as Max Baer, does. But this is not the failure of the movie. The problem is that Crowe's Braddock doesn't act, look, think, or express emotion like a boxer. Indeed, he has the sensibility of a file clerk or pushcart vendor, simply a man putting in another day at a dreary job. When you behold the monstrousness of Max Baer, you realize how flawed the construction is. Nobody walks into a buzz saw without powerful motivation, and "buying milk" simply isn't motivation enough, there are other ways to get milk, even for a simple man like Jim Braddock. His hangdog mopeyness lacks any of the braggadocio required to last even a round in a major fight, and his perpetually pained look, apparently on loan from Harrison Ford, simply doesn't jive with reality.<br /><br />Viewers able to forgive this will find much to like. Braddock is a wonderfully decent man, his morality is inspiring. Ron Howard knows his onions and did a lovely job with sets, costumes, interiors, (and cars!), the sense of history is exceptionally good. Paul Giamatti is outstanding, (forget Sideways but don't miss him in American Splendor). Renee Zellweger can do no wrong; I have never seen her give a bad performance. Try to avoid listening to the music; it's predictable, maudlin, and overwrought. Most of all, instead of seeing it as a boxing movie think of it as a morality tale of surviving the Great Depression. It works far better on that level, and Braddock becomes a far more interesting, and credible protagonist.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>3.5 Stars. I agree with another reviewer... I have been here before.  I like Ron Howard's movies, I do. (my favorite Apollo 13)  And though this movie is about a real person (just like A beautiful Mind and Seabiscuit) this film offers nothing new.  Yes, it's well acted--but it feels like a movie made for the sole purpose of an Academy Award vehicle.  See Russell Crowe act.  See Renee Z. act.  The one who stood out above the rest was Paul Giamatti who, IMHO, has blindsided the world in the past two years with his acting chops and range.<br /><br />Back to the film.  Jimmy is perfect.  He doesn't abide by stealing no matter how hungry the family is, he works everyday, and comes to the rescue of damsels in distress.  He doesn't curse, never raises his voice...I mean, c'mon.  I think there is a danger in creating perfect characters.  I can't relate to them..and I doubt this is the truth.  Hollywood uses their artistic freedom card frequently.<br /><br />It's a descent film but I wasn't wowed.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>Here we see what happens when a sports movie meets the Great Depression.  Films like this and THEY SHOOT HORSES DON'T THEY? make me glad I was not around in the 1930s and 1940s.  This is a true story, and one that is very inspiring indeed.<br /><br />Long before Sylvester Stallone created the character of Rocky Balboa, there was a man named James Braddock.  He was a down-on-his-luck fighter who was trying to simply make it through the Great Depression.  Most sports films center around an athlete who is driven by the desire to be the best at his / her craft.  James Braddock had a far more modest and pragmatic objective:  he simply wanted to support his family through one of the darkest chapters in U.S. history.<br /><br />The epoch in which the movie takes place makes it somewhat unique in the history of pugilism.  The 1920s and 1930s were the hayday of boxing, when it was the biggest game in town.  These days, of course, the lack of media attention, silly politics of the sport and the petulant (and sometimes bizarre) behavior of boxers has all led to an overall feeling of apathy.  In the 1930s big fights were big news.  Today, big fights barely warrant a clip on CNN.<br /><br />The film stars Russell Crowe and Renee Zelwegger.  They both do outstanding jobs.  Director Ron Howard has delivered another winner.  It's good that someone had the idea to tell the story of a man who lived in what is (for the most part) a forgotten time to most of us.<br /><br />James Braddock gets the chance of a lifetime against world heavyweight champion Max Baer due to some rather unlikely circumstances.  However, this is not just another David vs. Goliath boxing movie.  In many ways Braddock was a metaphor for people wanting to believe they could rebound from the depths of despair caused by the Great Depression.<br /><br /> Herbert Hoover was the most ineffective U.S. President up until the time of George W. Bush.  This film does a good job of detailing the drastic consequences of having a President who is in over his / her head.  However, in the darkest of times is when we need our heroes the most, and Braddock helped to inspire a great many denizens of the 30s.  He was, after all, the Cinderella Man.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J66TA573ZPRX.html">A1J66TA573ZPRX</a><br/><p>This is another great sports movie that will most likely be up for academy awards.

Renee Zellweger is hot.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2<br /><br />Although the comparisons may not be entirely obvious at first, could it be that Ron Howard's "Cinderella Man" is actually a sly, under-the-radar remake of "Seabiscuit" - albeit with a boxer rather than a racehorse as its inspirational underdog character?<br /><br />In a performance of immense restraint and subtlety, Russell Crowe plays James J Braddock, a Depression era fighter who, at one point, was so hard up that he could barely afford to feed his wife and three small children.  For awhile it seemed as if Braddock was all washed up as a boxer, a has-been whose body seemed incapable of taking any further punishment and whose glory days all lay behind him.  However, when his luck turned and he began to make a comeback in the ring, knocking off one sure-bet opponent after another, Braddock caught the imagination of a suffering nation, becoming in many ways a symbol of hope and renewal for the beleaguered, downtrodden, out-of-work masses who flocked to his bouts or listened to them enraptured on the radio at home.  It was for this reason that he was dubbed Cinderella Man by an astute and appreciative newspaper columnist.<br /><br />Let us say, first of all, that Braddock was no Jake La Motta, either in the ring or out.  From what we see of him in the film, Braddock was a kind, gentle man who loved his wife and tried to be the best father he could to his adoring children.  It is always more difficult to weave an interesting drama around a "good" character than a "bad" one, and Howard's film can't always overcome that limitation.  Frequently the film feels a mite softer and less hard-edged than we would like it to be, more "Rocky" than "Raging Bull."  Still, I guess the makers of the film were simply trying to remain true to their subject and for that they are to be commended.  The scenes between Crowe and Renee Zellweger as Mae, Braddock's concerned but supportive wife, serve as the fulcrum that keeps the story balanced and interesting.  Ditto for the relationship between Braddock and Joe Gould, his devoted manager, beautifully played by Paul Giamatti.  We also see Braddock instilling a strong sense of moral values into his children despite the harsh conditions under which they live.  For "Cinderella Man" effectively conveys just how difficult life was for many ordinary Americans in the 1930's, just how close to starvation many of them came in their daily struggle with poverty.  Braddock's tale is emblematic of life in that difficult era.<br /><br />Howard generates a tremendous amount of suspense in his closing scenes in which Braddock challenges the world's reigning champ, Max Baer, in a bout in Madison Square Garden Garden.  Howard brilliantly intercuts between the boxers, the fans and Mae, who is listening to the fight on the radio at home, terrified that her beloved husband may not survive the bout.<br /><br />Thus, despite the occasionally lackluster storytelling and overindulgence in sentimentality, "Cinderella Man" scores as a moving tribute to a decent man who never gave up.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MQQI4UYT9C11.html">A2MQQI4UYT9C11</a><br/><p>Rocky finds a time machine and emerges as Depression-era boxer Jim Braddock.  Russell Crowe plays the historical character who restarts his boxing career to feed his family and ends up heavyweight champion of the world after beating the feared Max Baer.

A solid effort by all involved, but somehow just a little too pat and too consciously inspirational.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>I wonder how much of what Clift Hollingsworth wrote made into the shooting script. Because this film has all the trademarks of yet another hackneyed job by Goldsman. He doesn't have a clue how to find grey areas in his characters. They're either good or bad. That's it. He hasn't seen a cinematic cliche he doesn't embrace. That's what's wrong with Ron Howard's film, "Cinderella Man." Apparently, boxer James J. Braddock's life was nothing but a series of cliches. That this film remains partially interesting is due to Russell Crowe's uncanny ability to disappear into a character and Paul Giamatti's sensationally terrfic performance as Braddock trainer, Joe Gould.</p></br><a href="../users/A345WVAVMMO6F0.html">A345WVAVMMO6F0</a><br/><p>director ron howard summons the kleenex yet again, this time in a phony movie about the depression.  i dont like boxing movies; i dont like subtly anti-semitic movies; i dont like russell crowe movies; i DO like opie taylor, but go back to mayberry and stop inflicting this "significant" garbage on the public.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>The Depression era in American history sapped the energy of the middle-class and the poor who were forced to scrap their dreams of a better life and scramble for survival. Work was scarce and many lost all hope. Two stories lifted the spirits of ordinary people who yearned for icons of triumph in the face of staggering odds. One was the story of Seabiscuit, the little racehorse that could, and the other was the incredible story of Jim Braddock, a stubborn and strong-willed washed-up boxer whose comeback in the ring was called by sports writer Damon Runyon one of the great human interest stories of all time. Ron Howard has fashioned a soul-stirring tribute to this working-class hero, the pride of New Jersey and the hope of the Irish. He has drawn out a riveting and impressive performance from Russell Crowe as the boxer and given Paul Giamatti a juicy role as Braddock's trainer and manager that ought to win him a Best Supporting Actor nod.<br /><br />In the 1920s, Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) is a winning fighter, a golden boy who is being groomed as a future champion. He's never been knocked out. His biggest supporter is his wife Mae (Renee Zellweger), although she cannot attend his fights because she would viscerally feel every punch that landed on his body. But the young man's promising career is derailed when due to a broken hand and bad luck, he puts in a shameful appearance in an important fight and has his license revoked.<br /><br />Four years later in 1932 in the midst of the Depression, the Braddocks and their three young children are living in a one-room apartment. Jim occasionally gets some work on the Hoboken docks, but it's not enough to pay the bills. Mae is forced to rip down a fence for fire wood after their electricity is turned off. In one of the linchpin scenes in the film, Jay (Connor Price), the oldest son, is taken by his father to the butcher to return a sausage he has stolen. It turns out that what has really upset the lad is the fear that he will be sent away to live with relatives, which happened to one of his friends. Jim makes a promise that he will never allow the family to be split up. But when things go from bad to worse, the boxer is forced to beg for money from his old associates at a Madison Square Garden hangout. His willingness to endure this humiliation is a sign of Jim's devotion to his family.<br /><br />Braddock's feisty and shrewd trainer and manager, Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), never loses his respect for Jim as a fighter and as a human being. He offers him a big pay-day match with a major contender when the opponent bows out shortly before the fight. Jim surprises everyone with a victory, especially a sports writer (Nicholas Campbell) who has lashed him in print. Gould, who is savvy about the boxing business and alert to Braddock's growing popularity with the public since his upset victory, plays his cards wisely with a snobbish and greedy fight promoter (Bruce McGill) who is convinced that the so-called Bulldog of Bergen just doesn't have what it takes to be a champion. Jim is elated when he learns that his manager has gotten him a series of matches where the winner will face the seemingly indomitable heavyweight champion Max Baer (Craig Bierko). The fury of Baer's punches have killed two men in the ring.<br /><br />Screenplay writers Cliff Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsman have created a hero for all ages with Braddock, a soft-spoken husband who packs a wicked upper cut and a belief that one must make the most out of second chances. Here is a hero who swallows his pride and accepts welfare to support his family, and after he wins a few matches, takes the money back to the federal relief agency as a natural expression of his responsibility. Here is a husband whose love for his wife never diminishes even when she finds it difficult to support his boxing career. Here is a friend who tries to help but cannot rescue Mike Wilson (Paddy Considine), a former Wall Street broker turned protester, when things go badly for him. And here is a father whose high ethical standards, such as keeping promises and being loyal through adversity, are passed on to his kids.<br /><br />Even when he sinks into abject poverty and it looks like he cannot take care of his loved ones, Braddock remains a heroic figure willing to keep on trying to secure a brighter future for them. No wonder so many fight fans and thousands of others who had no interest in boxing were ready to cheer for him as someone special, a shining star in an age of diminished hopes and ideals. Braddock was inwardly rich, and people recognized that in him. Now that's the kind of heroism we need in our jaded age of self-centered "apprentices" and "survivors."<br /><br />DVD features include addtional release material, deleted scenes with commentary by director Ron Howard, Feature Commentary with director Ron Howard aand writers Akiva Goldsman and Cliff Hollingsworth, and the featurettes "The Fight Card: Casting Cinderella Man," "The Man, The Movie, the Legend: a Film Making Journey," "For the Record: A History In Boxing," "Jim Braddock: the Friends & Family Behind the Legend," "Kodak Cinderella man," and "Ringside Seats."</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Success and riches can easily vanish when the golden goose has left.  Thus, it is essential that one nurtures and cares for their source of income, because that source brings home the bread, pays for the roof, and puts clothes on the back.  When the income ceases to exist it does not take long before poverty emerges, and poverty does not show sympathy.  In the footsteps of poverty several depressing concepts surface such as starvation, desperation, homelessness, and emotional and social disarray. Ron Howard captures these sad moments of destitution in his boxing film Cinderella Man where the main character, Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe), finds himself loosing a life of comfort during the Great Depression.<br /><br />The newspaper photo of a man getting his face bashed in by the ruthless glove of Jim Braddock opens the film, as it smoothly transitions into real life.  The scene shows Jim's youthful arrogance, as he knocks out the opponent.  His attitude resembles the lifestyle of the 1920s, which also was coined the roaring 20s.  It was a time after the First World War and prohibition was in full effect, as the underworld capitalized on smuggling booze.  People sought a fortune behind every corner to live life with happiness and joy.  However, this joyful time was about to come to an end with the crash on the New York Stock Exchange in October 1929.  Instead of displaying a historical montage of how people lost everything Ron Howard simply shoots an extraordinary panning shot of Jim and his wife's, Mae (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger), nightstand.  The camera pans to the left showing jewels and other extravagant accessories that eventually fade out and moves forward in time showing them living in a shabby room of a basement.<br /><br />The Great Depression seems to have affected everyone including Jim and Mae that now face poverty and continuous financial difficulty.  They do not have enough to feed their children and find themselves getting into debt as they try to find a way to make a living.  Jim's career as a boxer has also taken a turn downhill, as he no longer fights with the confidence he once had.  He also has a broken hand with which he enters the ring to provide his worst performance ever as a boxer, which ultimately leads the boxing federation to revoke his boxing license.  If this would not be enough, Jim's wrist is severely broken and their financial situation is getting worse.<br /><br />Despite the hardships Jim continues to breath, as if he had everything.  When one of his sons steals a salami from a butcher he lectures to him why they do not steal, but Jim also learns that his son is afraid of being sent away from his family due to the poverty to which Jim promises to never send any one of his children away.  However, the Braddock family's life continues to get worse, as they lose electricity and heat due to unpaid bills. It all begins to snowball and get out of Jim's control, which forces him to go on welfare.  Jim learns several life lessons that eventually will come of use, as he gets a one-time deal to box the number one contender for the title with one day's notice from his friend and old manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), who again provides a brilliant performance.  To everyone's amazement Jim comes out victorious from the fight, which leads to another fight and maybe another fight after that.<br /><br />Ron Howard's film shows the good side of a person, at times a little too good, but it is still convincing.  This is much due to the excellent performance by Russell Crowe who makes his second film with Howard since A Beautiful Mind (2001).  Crowe's character becomes the essence of bravery and perseverance, as he must overcome the odds of doing something most would consider impossible.  But it is also within this impossibility where the ordinary people in the film can find hope and dreams of something better after having endured years of poverty due to the aftermath of the Great Depression.  It is obvious that Howard is comfortable in creating films about hope and positive resolve, which always offers something good to ponder and reflect upon.<br /><br />Cinderella Man illustrates issues such as gender roles, perseverance, personal struggle, and self-improvement among many other issues in a time of extreme difficulty.  Yet, Howard does not create a truly unique story, as several boxing films have been made in the past that deal with the similar issues such as Rocky (1976), Raging Bull (1980), Hurricane (1999), Girlfight (2000), and Million Dollar Baby (2004).  Despite the likeness of other films Cinderella Man offers hope and another reason for people to keep their hopes up even when things seem to be depressing and impossible.  Thus, it is still a great film, which should not be missed, as it offers a truly excellent cinematic experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>I know what you are thinking, "Another movie about boxing?". But believe me when I tell you that this film is much more than just that. This is a story about fighting against the odds, even when you are down on your luck and it seems that there is nowhere to go. The real story of Jim Braddock shows us how this boxer could bring hope to thousands, who were ready to give up at the time of the Great Depression. And in the process, we get to know a little more about the man, his family and friends, and what it meant to live through the toughest economic crises the United States has ever experienced.<br /><br />Jim Braddock had everything going for him. It was the year 1928 and he was winning fights and becoming a serious contender for the light heavyweight championship. He had a beautiful wife, three kids, a nice house, and an agent / friend who supported him through every step. What more could he ask for? But then everything came tumbling down. He lost an important fight, suffered a series of injuries, and the market crashed, leaving him penniless. In 1933, we find him living in a one room apartment with his wife and kids, not able to pay the bills and begging for work at the docks, along with many others. He is still trying to make some money fighting, but when he breaks his hand and as a result disappoints the organizer of the bout, his license is revoked.<br /><br />When the situation becomes untenable, Jim has to swallow his pride and accept welfare. But that is not enough, so he has to go and beg to his old friends. And then, when he least expects it, opportunity knocks. The opponent of the number two contender for the title withdrew at the last moment and the organizers need a "punching bag" because the show must go on. Even though Jimmy has not trained in a while, he gladly accepts, and tired and hungry shows up for the fight. The rest...is history!<br /><br />I had some knowledge about the career of this boxer, but I had no information about his life. This movie provides a great look at the human being beyond the athlete. And what a great guy we find! Someone who has a iron will, who will do anything for his family as long as it is moral, and who provides a great example of what a father should be like. Russell Crowe becomes Jim Braddock, and does so in such a convincing way that it is almost uncanny. I am amazed by how much effort this actor puts into altering his physique to fit the character he is playing. He lost a pretty significant amount of weight to look like a fit boxer, and he even looks younger as a result.<br /><br />Rennee Zellweger plays the role of Jim's wife, and she does so with passion and commitment. Also, the actor that delighted us in "Sideways", Paul Giamatti, delivers a praiseworthy performance, even though he has a secondary role. His calm demeanor in this movie is almost funny to watch. Besides the great acting and the wonderful story of Braddock's life, the film counts with excellent settings and costumes that help reenact the period perfectly.<br /><br />This movie has taken the spot of my favorite drama with a sport's theme, and I cannot recommend it high enough!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>Crowe is so convincing as the down, but never out boxer, that you almost believe your watching a documentary. This is a Hollywood rags to riches tale based on a true story, but there are some liberties taken with the truth here. All in all it's still a wonderful film.<br /><br />I have nothing against 'Rocky', but this film is in another class. Heartfelt, inspirational and an eternal classic! Paul Giamatti gives a fantastic(should have won an Oscar!)performance as Braddock's manager. This is one of Ron Howards best films, if not the best picture he has ever made.<br /><br />If I have one complaint with the film, it is that the audio is too extreme between the boxing scenes and the talking scenes. I found myself adjusting the volume constantly either because I could not hear what was being said in the talking scenes or having my ears explode when they went to the fight scenes!....too bad.<br /><br />One of the best pictures I have seen in many years! The DVD has a great transfer and should be in everyone's movie collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Ron Howard's "Cinderella Man" is a feel-good-story that never drowns in a sea of schmaltz.  Its inspirational tale has all the trappings of a Hollywood fairy-tale but none of the sappy oversentimentality that often causes unintended nausea in filmgoers.<br /><br />Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) is a former heavyweight boxer who experiences hard times during the Great Depression.  He finds work as a longshoreman but does not earn enough to keep the electricity on at home.  An opportunity to improve his current situation arrives when Braddock's former manager, Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), offers him a chance to fight in a heavyweight bout.  If Braddock wins the fight then a title shot against champion Max Baer (Craig Bierko) would be in his future.<br /><br />There is nothing in "Cinderella Man" that you have not seen in similar underdog stories.  What makes this film special is the solid directing and the talented cast.  Howard continuously keeps the story moving at a steady pace while Crowe and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger are excellent as the fallen boxer and his loyal and loving wife.  Special recognition also goes out to Giamatti who is the energetic sparkplug of "Cinderella Man."  He steals practically every scene he is in and shows through his character how important it is for human beings to have compassion for one another.  To sum things up succinctly, "Cinderella Man" is one of those special films that truly inspires while it entertains.</p></br><a href="../users/A37B3O457INKEA.html">A37B3O457INKEA</a><br/><p>CINDERELLA MAN is one of the most outstanding boxing movies ever produced by Hollywood.Filmed mostly in Toronto, it follows the career of James J. Braddock who fought from 1926 to 1941.Plagued by brittle hands,Braddock still manages to win the heavyweight title from Max Baer on June 13,1935 in Long Island City,New York.The win is considered a remarkable feat for Braddock since he has sufferred many defeats due mostly to persistent injuries in prior years.The fact that Braddock loses his first title defense to Joe Louis in 1937 is not highlighted in the screenplay.The motion picture is fascinating for boxing fans as it dramatizes Braddock's bouts with Max Baer,Art Lasky,Corn Griffin,Abe Feldman and John Henry Lewis as well as Baer's fight against Primo Carnera for the championship in 1934.<br /><br />The movie does not try to alter Braddock's history and Ron Howard deserves high praise for his direction.Russell Crowe is convincing as Braddock and Renee Zellweger does a magnificent job in her role as Braddock's resolute wife.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti won Best Supporting Actor Awards from both the Boston Society of Film Critics and the Broadcast Film Critics Association for his portrayal of Joe Gould, Braddock's manager.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>Based on the true Drepression Era story of James Braddock, a pennyless, washed-up heavyweight boxer who returns to the ring against all the odds and wins the Heavyweight Boxing Title!<br /><br />This is a heart wrenching tale of personal integrity and unflinching determination during a time of hopelessness. Russell Crowe fully embodies the soul of the legendary fighter James Braddock, while director Ron Howard expertly captures the patheos and collective loss of a generation in search of one single ray of hope.<br /><br />Great performances abound; Renee Zellweger as Mae Braddock, Paul Giamatti (incredible performance) as Jim's manager Joe Gould and Paddy Considine as his best friend Mike. Special praise for Craig Buerko as the defending champ and 'terror of the ring', Max Baer. Truly the perfect foil for Crowe.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Ron Howard<br /><br />Cast:  Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger, Paul Giamatti, Craig Bierko, Paddy Considine, Bruce McGill, David Huband, Linda Kash, Nicholas Campbell.<br /><br />Running Time:  145 minutes<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for boxing violence and some language.<br /><br />The formula for the perfect sports drama is certainly one that all movie-goers know by heart and directors worry until they are scrapping their bald scalps for some way to create an original "Rocky"-esque fairy tale masterpiece and eventually come to their senses-the originality of the great American sports drama is what makes them so entertaining.  The excellent, heart-warming tale of the legendary boxer James J. Braddock, told through the eyes and ears of director Ron Howard, is represented with great original compassion in "Cinderella Man".  The film does not try to throw any sucker punches with obscure plot twists, racial integration undertones, or shock the viewer with its riveting, edge-of-your-seat, show-stopping, popcorn-flying-off-the-lap, special effects dilapidated , hard-hitting climax; instead it provides a very realistic, historical account of one of the greatest American heroes of the Great Depression.<br /><br />Russell Crowe coagulates himself as perhaps the best actor of the past decade (with a resume that consists of starring roles in "L.A. Confidential", "The Insider", "Gladiator", "A Beautiful Mind", two Best Actor and two Best Picture wins, who are you to argue?) with another grand performance as the hard-working, right-hookin' fighter James J. Braddock, who at one time in the late 1920's looked to be one of the most promising young fighters to jump into the ring at Madison Square Garden.  With a few broken hands and a depression that through his entire family into a small, cold apartment in the city, Braddock lost the ability to earn the big fight and had to make a living outside of the boxing world.  While working at the docks with his pal (Paddy Considine) years after his last fight, Braddock learns from his long time trainer (in an Oscar-worthy performance from the snappy Paul Giamatti) that he has been given the opportunity by the head of the boxing commission (Bruce McGill) to have one more fight.  Braddock begins to win once again, not only shocking his colleagues and critics, but the entire boxing world.  The film eventually leads to the dramatic finale, in which Braddock is giving the chance of a lifetime-a heavy-weight fight against the great champion Max Baer (Craig Bierko), who has already killed several men inside of the ring.<br /><br />Just as all great sports films, "Cinderella Man" is only a sports film secondarily and a family drama at the forefront.  The true essence of Braddock (and Crowe with his superb performance) is outside of the ring, in which he spends time with his wife (Renee Zellweger) and children.  It is these tender moments and the trials and tribulations that Braddock endures for the ones he truly loves that shows not only the incredible horrors that people faced during the depression era, as well as the extraordinary love that Braddock and his wife Mae utilized to right the ship of life.  Director Ron Howard creates a supremely predictable film, but it is so well made and powerful that it does not even matter.  "Cinderella Man" is a true testament to hard-work, courage, and sincerity-ideals plausible for all.  A splendid two-and-a-half hour experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QJ649N8PRV.html">A16QJ649N8PRV</a><br/><p>This is an excellent and entertaining film that depicts the spirit of sports at its best.<br /><br />The basic storyline features the fall and rise of former world heavyweight boxing champion James J. Braddock.  He went from being a top ranked fighter in the 1920s to a down on his luck fighter struggling to feed his family during the Great Depression.  He fought poorly in a series of fights when he had a broken hand just to put food on the table.  Eventually he had his boxing license suspended for his poor performances.<br /><br />Soon he was barely scraping by with day to day work loading and unloading on the docks.  He eventually gets an opportunity to have another fight and the movie really gains momentum from there.  He keeps winning unexpectedly in bouts against opponents who are likely to whip him.<br /><br />During this unlikely comeback, he finally gets a title shot against World Heavyweight Champion Max Baer, who has killed two opponents in the ring.<br /><br />Although the first part of the movie may be a bit slow, it really gains momentum as it goes along.  It paints the grimness of the Great Depression in a very depressing and realistic way.  Part of the plot is way over the top (as is so typical and predictable in movies).  In this one, Max Baer is presented as a killing machine who enjoys hurting people.  My brief research of him revealed that he actually gave purses from some of his fights to the family of a fighter he had accidentally killed.  I also learned that he had a Star of David embroidered on his trunks when fighting German Max Baer during the Nazi heyday.  That didn't make him sound like the rotten scoundrel that Director Ron Howard tried to portray.  As is so typical of Hollywood, the ruling elite can't settle on the truth.  That isn't interesting enough for them evidently.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is a very good film portraying a classic American rags to riches story.  I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>When entertainment transcends its ephemeral home to capture the viewer and move him or her to an emotional groundswell of thought and reflection, the entertainment takes on an additional dimension, ultimately affecting those who have appreciated its message and its story.  And the true story of James J. Braddock, so wonderfully portrayed in Ron Howard's fascinating film CINDERELLA MAN, is an absolute tribute to the rugged determination of the human spirit. . .to the never-ending journey of love and fulfillment.  This movie nails human conflict, perseverance, and determination right on their collective heads, and leaves the viewer gaping in overwhelmed astonishment.<br /><br />Jim Braddock, an up-and-coming boxer from Jersey, supposedly had the world by the horns in the late 1920's, as he won bout after bout on his way to getting a shot at the heavyweight title of the world.  But Jim, like countless millions of others, would stumble and fall when the Stock Market crashed and the Great Depression hit; finding himself penniless and destitute, he was forced to move his family from a comfortable home in the suburbs to a squalid basement apartment, where a series of injuries sabotaged his boxing career to the point he could no longer compete--to the point he was decommissioned as a New York boxer.  Subsequently, Jim Braddock embarked on a desperate life of hand-to-mouth existence:  begging for jobs on the loading docks, standing by helplessly as the apartment lost its heat in the dead of winter, with his children growing sick from the relentless cold. . .until he had to apply for state relief.  Then, miraculously, his spirited manager was able to convince the Madison Square Garden promoter to allow Jim to fill in for a boxer who couldn't make an important bout versus a formidable heavyweight contender; without training a single day, hungry and disheveled, Jim wins the bout, and sets about a chain reaction of events that will have him moving steadily up the ranks of heavyweight contenders to face champion Max Baer, the most dangerous boxer of his era--a man who had already killed two men in the ring.  And while Jim began his meteoric rise through the boxing echelon, he captured the hearts and souls of a disenfranchised populace who connected with him and cheered him; Jim Braddock was their symbol, their icon that proved success could be obtained, even against overwhelming odds.<br /><br />This is riveting material, from the recreation of Depression Era Manhattan, to the depths of poverty and want, to the exceptional storytelling, and yes, the boxing scenes, which are completely believable.  But where the story ultimately triumphs, in this reviewer's opinion, is in the steadfast love and devotion of Jim and his very spirited wife, Mae (Rene Zellweger).  The film begins with Jim married to Mae, and stays the course accordingly; not one time is the love and affection between these two people ever questioned or disparaged, despite considerable obstacles.  Crowe and Zellweger exhibit flawless chemistry on screen, and it's fun and compelling to watch.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti is fantastic as Joe Gould, Jim's long-suffering, loyal manager, while Craig Bierko ushers in a new dimension of rogue via his portrayal of heavyweight champ Max Baer.  Here's an interesting bit of trivia:  Baer's son, Max, Jr., went on to enjoy a very successful Hollywood career by portraying Jethro Bodine in the sitcom, "Beverly Hillbillies."  'Tis a small, small world. . .<br /><br />CINDERELLA MAN is quality, epic entertainment.  Not to be passed up, but gobbled up.  When Mae Braddock goes to her local Catholic parish to pray for her husband on the night of his long-awaited fight with Baer, she finds the church packed with other worshippers praying for the goodness of her husband.  That's good stuff, and it moved me to tears.  And so will this film.  Highly, highly recommended.<br /><br />--D.

I'll take that even one step further and declare that this movie should earn Ren&eacute;e Zellweger a BEST ACTRESS award.<br /><br />There are so many things to love about this movie that I don't really know where to begin, but I'll try:<br /><br />#1.  The cinematography is captivating, drawing the audience into the Great Depression and the anguish that it was.  Every frame seemed to bring the struggle of the times to life on the screen - more so than any movie I can think of.<br /><br />#2.  The script for this movie cuts out any unnecessary scenes that might cause the movie to drag.  I saw a few reviewers thought the movie started off a little slow.  I could not disagree with them more!  This movie grabs you from the very beginning and never lets you go!<br /><br />#3.  Russell Crowe seemed to transform himself into the boxer, Jim Braddock, and I have never seen Crowe perform this good.  I can't wait for this movie to come out on DVD!<br /><br />#4.  Ren&eacute;e Zellweger works magic in her role as Braddock's wife, Mae.  Her performance left very few dry eyes in the movie theater I was in.  I was reading the book just before I watched the movie, and if ever an actress "nailed" a role, Renee Zellweger does with this one.  I will always see her as Mae!<br /><br />#5.  Paul Giamatti rises to the occasion, with a superb reincarnation (okay, that's an exaggeration) of Joe Gould, Jim Braddock's friend and manager.  Paul adds so much flavor and character to this film that I could not imagine anyone else in his role.<br /><br />#6.  Every teenager in America should be required to watch this film.  It could be used as a learning tool to inspire young people to save money, teach them to enjoy the things they have in life right now, and remind them that times are not really "so hard" compared to what the people went through seventy years ago.<br /><br />This movie can really put into perspective the silliness of kids crying over not being able to own a 200-dollar pair of gym shoes!<br /><br />If you haven't seen this film, what are you waiting for?  This is the best film out this year!  And yes, it is a must-see!<br /><br />See ya next review!</p></br><a href="../users/A1FNES0QEBJZD1.html">A1FNES0QEBJZD1</a><br/><p>I must say that I loved this movie and originally bought the standard edition, now upgraded it to the Blu Ray version.  Won't get into summarizing the story lines as, when I buy a DVD, I already know the movie and am only interested in the quality of the DVD itself.<br /><br />The video transfer is one of the very best I have seen.  The depression era sepia colors look as natural and balanced as one could ever expect and I saw no video noise or aliasing.  To my eyes, this video transfer is simply outstanding.  The DTSHD audio was crisp and clear.  However, the sound editors appeared to mux the rear channels, used especially for the arena crowd scenes, into one output.  In other words, the audio in the rear channels did not sound as if the rears were discreet channels.  There were no whistles coming from the right while a shout came from the left.  It sounded as if whatever came out of one came out of the other as well.  On this score, I was a bit disappointed as audio is very important to me and too many companies scrimp on the audio end of editing.  Front left and right channels were used discreetly tho sparingly as, other than the fight scenes, this is a dialogue driven film.<br /><br />There are a ton of excellent extras, most from 2005, and even a newsreel of the original heavyweight championship match between Braddock and Baer.  I read some time ago that Baer's son hated the way his father was portrayed.  The acting was excellent all around and Russell Crowe even moved and looked like the real Cinderella Man.  Renee Zellweger's performance was the most sincere I have ever seen her and she should have gotten more attention for this.  The only bad extra amongst many was a Kodak Gallery which was little more than an advertisement for them and contributed nothing.  However, you will find that all the other extras will retain your interest and enthusiasm.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of help and, if so, please check the 'Helpful' button so I know I am on the correct path with my reviews for you. Thanks.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I knew why they made a movie about Jim Braddock, which means I knew what was going to happen in "Cinderella Man," not only in terms of the big fight but also most of what was going to appear on the title cards at the end.  However, people who did not know anything about Jim Braddock or were not aware that this was one of those movies based on a true story could guess what the final outcome was going to be.  After all, Rocky only tried the idea that winning could be defined as going the distance as opposed to actually winning a fight once.  Did you really think Seabiscuit was going to lose to War Admiral?<br /><br />Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) was a successful light-heavyweight boxer who lost a titlle fight and then broke his right hand a couple of times.  He started losing more often than he won and quit boxing to work as a longshoreman.  During the Depression he ended up on relief trying to keep his family together and then got a fluke chance for a fight in which he was to be a sacrificial lamb to a top heavyweight contender.  That is where the Cinderella part of the story comes into play, ending up with a title fight with the heavyweight champion, Max Baer (Craig Bierko).<br /><br />The true story of a long shot getting a title fight is pretty compelling to begin with, but the screenplay by Cliff Hollingsworth ("Too Good to Be True") and Akiva Goldsman ("A Beautiful Mind") goes out of its way to up the ante by turning Baer into a man-killer.  While the story is faithful to Braddock's character and makes it central to the story, it takes the fact that a fighter once died after being hit by Baer and makes it a major character and plot point.  Baer is a smiling brute who is perfectly willing to hit below the belt when he is not separating his opponent's brain from its connecting tissue, and everybody buys into the idea that Baer could kill Braddock in the ring to the point that Braddock's wife, Mae (Renee Zellweger) is convinced that is exactly what is going to happen.  Baer's line that "People die in fairy tales all the time," is a good one, but this all overdramatizes what is already a dramatic situation.<br /><br />Fortunately "Cinderella Man" saves most of its best moments for when Braddock is in the ring.  For me the choice moment is in the Art Lasky fight, when Braddock gets tagged so hard his mouthpiece goes flying across the ring and he is staggered.  On the verge of going down his mind flashes on images of how far down he has been.  When your wife ships your kids off to live with relatives because there is no longer any power in the house, what is a kick in the head?  Braddock turns to Lasky and smiles a him-and you know this fight is over right then and there.<br /><br />Where director Ron Howard triumphs in "Cinderella Man" in not in comparison to the "Rocky" movies or even "Seabiscuit," because he is taking aim at the Holy Grail of boxing movies, "Raging Bull."  Obviously Jim Braddock's character is pretty much the opposite of Jake LaMotta, but this is not about that or about comparing Russell Crowe to Robert De Niro.  Instead it is about Howard going up against Martin Scorcese in terms of the boxing sequences, and while I could talk about specific cinematic elements (e.g., use of flashbulbs and flashbulb effects), what I thought was most impressive was the sense of the strategic ebb and flow of the fights.  In Braddock's corner is Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), and any boxing neophyte is going to be able to understand the instructions he gives his fighter.  I do not know if these are the longest fight scenes in movie history, but they certainly seem like the most comprehensive.  We always have a sense for what is happening in each fight, and there are bonus points for Thomas Newman's understated scoring of the fights.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>It is refreshing to see a movie with no villains, and representing a true success story.  I hope that no one comes along with something disparaging about Braddock, who is portrayed as honest, steady, competent, and personable.  The three main actors were excellent and gave credibility to the story.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>I just thought this was a great movie. Back in the mid-70's I was living in an apartment on the East Side of New York. I have the TV on with the Morning News show and the cerebral guy and the terminally cute "colleague." Gene Shallitt was reviewing "Rocky." I'm in the bathroom shaving but you can still hear Shallitt's New York 'youwantmustardwitdat' intonation. He said about Rocky, "it ain't about boxing."<br /><br />And likewise I would say that Ron Howard creates a perfect movie for the dignity of humans, the depression, the love of family, the promises made to children, second chances, self respect and loyalty. Whew. What a plateful.<br /><br />Howard gets criticized from time to time with the comment that he spoon feeds his audience. Hey. I just saw Oliver Stone's "Alexander" and I'm still trying to figure out what was the point? So if Ron Howard's going to spoon feed me, so what? He's the director. I'm neither Freud nor Einstein. I'm just a moviegoer.<br /><br />What I want to know is what marketing genius decided to release this as a 'summer film?' The audience you were releasing this film for then, sir or madam, continues to believe that "Dumb and Dumber" was the movie of the decade and they were robbed, man, at the oscars!!!<br /><br />I mean three brilliant actors, a complicated topic (whatever country is he talking about, dude?), and a boxxing movie. Where's Nicole and Reese? No cars. Where's Vin Diesel? No sex? No naked chicks?<br /><br />So, see this movie. Buy this movie. See it a second time. Be a guy and get just a little teary eyed. Excellent. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></br><a href="../users/A3K8TYU7UOUTR0.html">A3K8TYU7UOUTR0</a><br/><p>I was very excited about the release of this film. James Braddock has always been one of my favorite stories in the history of boxing. His story, known to all now, would certainly make a great movie. Unfortunately, this isn't it.<br /><br />Director, Ron Howard, in an effort to add drama to a story that required no enhancement, has produced a movie full of one dimensional characters and elongated scenes of sloppy sentiment. The film has so many scenes of slushy gush, surging violins, and black-hearted villains that the true character of Braddock is lost amid the stock Hollywood set-ups.<br /><br />Howard, who seems physically incapable of trusting an audiance, has to give his cartoon Braddock many hurtles. Poor Renee Zellweger as Mae Braddock is forced into the stock role for boxing movie wives, that of shrill shrike withdrawing all support from her husband for his dedication to the fight game. The real Mae Braddock, of course, was made of the same stern stuff as her husband and was nothing but supportive of Braddock's career.<br /><br />And of course there is the problem of Max Baer<br /><br />Howard had to have a villain, I suppose, without any shades of grey, so the memory of Max Baer is sacrificed. I cannot recall a Hollywood creation that has so criminally maligned the memory of a real life character as does Howard with his treatment of Max Baer. In the movie, "Max Baer" is a killer of men that clearly enjoys killing and hurting people. He is a repulsive, crude braggart that threatens to Kill Braddock in the ring, suggesting that once he has done so, he will be glad to "comfort the widow."<br /><br />In reality, Max Baer was a gentle man who was nearly cursed with a sledgehammer punch and powerful physique. He did kill a man (Frankie Campbell) in the ring, and it nearly ruined his life. Everyone close to Baer commented on the deep depression he entered after the horrible event.  Baer helped Campbell to his corner after the fight (Campbell died hours later in hospital, not "on the spot", as in the film) and went with him to the hospital. Baer paced the corridors outside Campbell's room, praying aloud. When he was told that Campbell was dead, he broke into sobs so that tears ran down his face. His first act was to approach Campbell's widow, who was with him at the hospital and ask her forgiveness. She gave it instantly, comforting Baer by telling him it wasn't his fault - explaining that it might have gone the other way - that it was just the fight game.<br /><br />Baer was unable to sleep for a week after the fight, saying that he couldn't stop reliving the fight over in his mind. He began smoking again, a habit he had licked to stay in shape. Everyone that knew him agreed: he was never the same fighter after the death of Frankie Campbell. He simply didn't punch as hard and all the joy had gone out of the sport for him. From that day forward, boxing was just a job he was good at. Baer himself said, "Nothing that ever happened to me - nothing that can ever happen to me - affected me like the death of Frankie Campbell."<br /><br />Max Baer's son, Max Junior, said that as he was growing up, his father often cried when thinking about Frankie Campbell. For those interested in the real James Braddock as well as the real Max Baer, let me suggest Jeremy Schaap's excellent biography, "Cinderella Man" from which most of the above details come from, and which does not suffer from Howard's adolescent need for "bad guys" to tell a story.<br /><br />Perhaps Ron Howard might some day make a film about Max Baer to put things right. But no, that wouldn't work. In that film Howard would still need a villain and James J. Braddock would have to become a drunken wife beater.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>There's been a lot of hand-wringing analysis about why Ron Howard's terrific true-life drama CINDERELLA MAN (Universal, $30) failed to catch fire at the box office, even with rave reviews.  Was it the title?  The time of release?  The poster?  Or perhaps audiences felt sucker-punched by Clint Eastwood's unhappy-ending boxing melodrama Million Dollar Baby.<br /><br />Whatever the reason, this gripping account of depression era, washed-up, ex-prizefighter James J. Braddock's triumphant comeback deserves DVD discovery.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is outstanding as Braddock, an honorable but ordinary "everyman" who became a symbol of a beaten-up populace.  Against all odds, the determined Braddock risked all in a literal fight to save his family that culminates in the 15 round 1935 slugfest with Max Baer, a giant of a heavyweight champ who had killed two men in previous fights.<br /><br />This is great filmmaking by a director at the peak of his powers.  Wonderful period detail enhances the emotion in every frame of this inspiring story. Crowe not only looks and sounds like Braddock, he masterfully recreates his boxing style.<br /><br />It's strange how some actual lives hit all the beats that are the essentials of timeless, fictional stories.  Braddock's story would be unbelievable if it weren't all-true.<br /><br />Extras include: The original Braddock/Baer fight, deleted scenes, a portrait of Braddock by family and friends and an enthusiastic commentary (one of three) by Howard.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JPFWKS83R49V.html">A3JPFWKS83R49V</a><br/><p>"Cinderella Man" is a very good movie about the true- life story of a boxing underdog who came back against all odds and fought the world champion of the world. This movie is about boxing legend Jim Braddock and it focuses on his time both in and out of the ring. Most people felt that Braddock was finished with boxing and didn't have what it took to win anymore. But Braddock proved them wrong, winning fight after fight against men who were younger and winning the opportunity to fight Max Baer in Madison Square Garden in front of a huge crowd.<br /><br />This movie is loaded with action, both in and out of the ring. First, we have Paul Giamatti in the role as Jim's trainer and promoter, Joe Gould. He is a businessman and a smooth talker who has occasional doubts that Jim can still fight but who still promotes his man with a vengeance, explaining to promoters why he feels that Braddock deserves another chance at glory. In many parts of the film, Giamatti's emotion exceeds that of Crowe's and he keeps the movie interesting with his volatile nature.<br /><br />Second, we have the action taking place inside the Braddock household between Jim and wife Mae. Renee Zellweger plays the role of Mae and she is quite good. She shows her support for husband Jim but she privately hopes that he will retire from this sport for good. She knows the reputation of Max Baer and she doesn't want to become a widow like the two other wives whose husbands died following a bout with the champ. She is concerned for Jim, for herself, and for the family. But like a good, supportive spouse, she comes through in the end and backs her husband on his big day.<br /><br />Russell Crowe's Braddock character is very cool and collected considering what is taking place around him. He knows his wife wants him to quit and he knows she is right, to an extent. But his heart is in the ring and at this point, he really cannot back down. How would it look to the rest of the boxing world if he suddenly decided not to fight Baer? He really didn't have a choice at this point and in spite of Baer's taunts and trash- talking, he still remains cool, keeping his level of concentration on the upcoming fight.<br /><br />I liked all of the performers in this movie. I can't really find anything to fault with any of them. Crowe is excellent in his role as Braddock who, according to things I have read about him, was very much like the man portrayed in the movie. Zellweger is great too, as always. Probably the greatest surprise is the excellent performance turned in by Paul Giamatti as Braddock's trainer. Giamatti is a veteran of the big screen and he has been in many memorable roles. But there is something unique about this one and his moving performance almost netted him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.<br /><br />Besides the performances, Cinderella Man has many other positive points and chief among these is the message to continue to pursue one's dreams in spite of the odds. Braddock was struggling to make ends meet during this era (the Great Depression) and most people felt like he should quit fighting and get a regular job, like everyone else. He had been wealthy from past wins, but now had lost everything due to tough economic times. He was even forced to accept public assistance at one point to keep his family alive. But instead of taking what life had handed him, he got up, brushed himself off, and moved forward in pursuit of his goals. He also showed incredible courage. How many among us would have the guts to step into a boxing ring against a man who is known to have killed two others during a boxing match? Most people would have retired then and there; making up an excuse, if necessary, to avoid the humiliation. But Braddock goes ahead and agrees to the challenge.<br /><br />Another great part of this movie is the directing, especially during the boxing match at the end of the movie. Ron Howard delivers once again, showing some of the punches in normal speed and some in slow motion. He also shows what the other guy must look like to a man who has just been bashed in the head dozens of times through the use of blurred vision and unclear images. You can just feel the tremendous forces of those fists as they bash against the opponent's faces and bodies. You can sense the physical pain that each man is experiencing when they walk back to their respective corners of the ring with their faces full of scratches and their noses dripping with blood. You can feel the sense of dizziness that the two guys are experiencing when Howard blurs the screen. The directing is near- perfect during this and other parts of the film and it leaves a lasting impression in your mind.<br /><br />Ron Howard keeps things all in the family in this movie. His brother Clint Howard makes a brief appearance playing one of the referees and his father, Rance Howard, makes an appearance playing announcer Al Fazin. This movie was also a reunion of sorts for Howard and Russell Crowe. They were both responsible for the success of the 2001 Best Picture "A Beautiful Mind" so it shouldn't be surprising that the two men would team up once again to make another movie.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good movie that is inspirational as well as entertaining. Crowe, Giamatti, Zellweger, and the others all come through under the guiding hand of Ron Howard to create a memorable movie about the sport of boxing and the challenges that come with it. I don't rank it as my favorite boxing movie (that honor still belongs to "Raging Bull"), but it still has enough positive qualities to earn it an easy recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LH77PBDFEO3F.html">A3LH77PBDFEO3F</a><br/><p>Let me state from the get go... I am not a Russell Crowe fan. He doesn't seem like the kind of guy I would like to know.<br /><br />But after reluctantly watching this film, I have to say he has a brilliant talent. Cinderella Man is a heartwarming and touching, and in the end inspirational film. How is it I never heard the story of James J. Braddock before?<br /><br />Ron Howard continues to surprise as a director, getting better and better.<br /><br />If you want to see a well directed, well acted, inspirational film this is the one.</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>Russell Crowe may be the Marlon Brando of the 21st century after 5 years of great films, his greatest is stil Gladiator and now his second greatest is Ron Howard's uplifting masterpiece "Cinderella Man" this good hearted biographical story of depression era boxer Jim Braddock, who brought hope to those in the great depression. a shining and starlighting triumph that is Ron Howard's greatest film,  and by the magic of Ron Howard I can't believe my eyes and ears that not many people went to go see this beautiful picture, it did come out at the wrong time. It's still wonderess to behold, a real fairy tale hence the title "Cinderella Man" one of Hollywood's greatest motion pictures. Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger and Paul Giamatti are marvelous. See this entertainment gem before the oscars. Jake La Motta and Rocky Balboa are knocked out by this knockout king of a movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>Despite of all the negative press Russell Crowe seem to get off screen, there is no denying that he is one of Hollywood's superb actors. Once more in the movie Cinderella Man, Crowe proves that not only can he act superbly but also bring out the essence of his character to light in an unbelievable way. It also helped that he was well supported by Paul Giamatti and Renee Zellewager although I wasn't totally impressed with Zellewager's performance all the way.<br /><br />Based on the true story of James Braddock who won the heavyweight boxing title against all odds and prediction, this movie proves that even with all the cliches, if it done right, it will worked out fantastically. (Cliches worked well in Mel Gibson's When We Were Soldiers... and it worked well in this movie.) The movie is well scripted, well directed and superbly acted. A quality Hollywood film...a rarity nowadays.<br /><br />I read one of the previous reviewers giving this movie a low rating because it looked like a clone of Rocky. I believed that is an unfair statement considering that Rocky itself, was a clone from earlier boxing films.<br /><br />If there is a flaw, I think it lies in the portrayal of Max Baer. I have read that family of Max Baer is quite furious with Ron Howard for portraying Baer like some cheap, underhanded dirty boxer who appears to enjoyed killing boxers in the ring. In some way, they have some justified complaint since the entire Max Baer as a film villian, appears to be overhyped and heavy handed. A very clumsy move by an another wise skilled director in a quality film.<br /><br />Despite of that, the movie still work well and you can't help but get involved into the film even if the informative individuals like myself already knows the outcome of the story. I guess that is a hallmarked of a quality film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>This movie is by far the best film I've ever seen.  Hands down.  It shows the pure human emotion that will make you stand up and cheer at the end, not just because theres an amazing triumph, but because of WHO you are watching triumph.  Crowe at his best to date stars as Braddock, a man who was once at his best and then, due to arthritis and we can't forget the depression falls flat on his face, working day jobs here and there where he can and fighting nameless fights when given the chance all just to provide for his family.  It's heart wrenching to watch Crowe give his breakfast to his hungrey daughter or to watch him beg for money from the boxing comm. with his hat in his hands.  Crowes performance is so intence and so real that it took me a bit to realize I was watching a movie.  I was actually brought to tears for Crowe and not Braddock.  As fate would have it Braddock is given a chance at redemption and he takes it...winning fight after fight until he goes up against Max Baer for the title.  The last scene is so intence, and even though we all know how it ends we can't help but cringe thinking somehting bad may happen.  This is by far the best boxing/family drama I've ever scene.  Blows 'Million Dollar Baby' out of the water, and that was something I didn't excpect.  See this movie, becasue it's worth every minute.</p></br><a href="../users/A12IRGQLFE4EBA.html">A12IRGQLFE4EBA</a><br/><p>As usual both Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger make outstanding performances in Cinderella Man.  They are both fabulous actors anyway but this movie comes together nicely!  They compliment each other well as husband and wife ...<br /><br />This movie is really just too perfect for words.  The dialog is solid, the acting is solid, the setting is solid ... even the costumes and backdrop looks like America circa 1930's in New York!  Ron Howard has again outdone himself.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  I haven't walked away feeling great from a good, well written solid movie in a long time!  Cinderella Man is the perfect cherry on top of the sundae. ;)</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>"Cinderella Man" is, simply, a wonderful film.  It is a tale of heroism in the face of adversity, a victory of stoicism and a truly heart warming story.  It is far better than I expected and a credit to the direction of Ron Howard and the superb acting skills of Russell Crowe.<br /><br />The plot is based, as is said in Hollywood, on a true story.  James J. Braddock is an up and coming boxer in the late 1920s in America.  However, his rise to the top is plagued by injury until he loses his boxing license at the time the world was plummeting into the Great Depression.  Braddock's family is slowly worn down by the economics of the situation in which they find themselves.  Bills pile up, the power is cut off and hunger lurks.  Braddock is forced to beg for money to tide him over.<br /><br />When things look as though they can get no worse, Braddock is offered a one off fight for a $250 purse.  He leaps at the opportunity even though he is not fighting fit except for the benefit of having worked some time on the New York docks.  To everyone's surprise, including his, Braddock wins the fight.  The rest, as is said, is history.  Bigger prizes await.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this film to all.  It has real cred while, at the same time, it tugs at the heart strings.  Russell Crowe is absolutely magnificent.  He is James J. Braddock.  Have no doubts, this is a great film!</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>Ron Howard's "Cinderella Man" has about as much sap to it as the 1930s boxing film "The Champ". But "Cinderella Man" has about as much heart as that movie and I think can have the same emotional effect of "Million Dollar Baby", though "Raging Bull" it is not, but does it need to be? No.<br /><br /> Yes its true the movie does use plenty of cliches, we get the swelling music at the movie's more sentimental moments, and the sometimes cheesy dialogue, but I went along with the movie and got choked up at all the right moments. In this sense "Cinderella Man" belongs in the same class as Howard's other films such as "Apollo 13" and "A Beautiful Mind" which reteams many of the same people besides Russell Crowe and Howard. The film was written by Akiva Goldsman, who also wrote "Mind" and is produced by Brian Grazer as well.<br /><br /> "Cinderella Man" is based on the true story of James J. Braddock (Crowe), a fighter who at one time was the lightweight champion until losing the title, in what was described as a beating for Braddock. Sadly though that fight is never shown on-screen. After the depression hits, Braddock takes fights that don't draw much of a crowd, and those that do show up are disappointed. Most people feel the guy is all washed up. One of his fights is declared a "no contest" as the crowd starts to boo cauing Braddock to lose out on that day's pay. But Braddock has to keep on going, despite what people may think of him because of his family. His wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) supports him in her own way, which is by never attending a fight. She says each time Jim takes a hit, it's like she's taken one too. Now how original is that line, I ask you? And then there is their three children, two boys and a girl, that they just can't support. One of the boys actually steals some food for them. But then one day Braddock is given a second chance in what was suppose to be his swan-song fight. He goes up against the number two contender for the heavyweight title. And thus starts his comeback giving a down and out nation hope.<br /><br /> That story may sound an awful lot like the 2003 film "Seabiscuit". Apparently there were a lot of heroes during the depression giving people hope. If there was so much hope going around, why do we always see such sad people? Both movies tells us the story of the underdog. How one man (or horse) was given a second chance and when that was given the country backed him. He bacame a symbol of the times. A down and out man in a down and out time who tried to fight back and work his way up. Isn't that the American story? People with nothing, if they come to America, will end up with something, usually debt, but that's another movie.<br /><br /> I'm kidding though when I take some jabs at this movie. I'm really down playing my admiration for the movie, because I feel you don't want to read a review that's going to do nothing but praise the movie. You probably want something more objective. But the movie does have a lot to recommend. Crowe is quite good in the movie. He has played heroes before, people who have fought the odds against them in movies such as "Gladiator", "A Beautiful Mind" and "The Insider". So Crowe seems suited for these type of movies. I also liked Howard's directing. As I said before, yes he uses some cheap tricks on us to gain our sympathy, but they work. I didn't feel as if the movie was throwing too much at us. At its heart "Cinderella Man" is really just an old-fashion story about finding the American dream. It's a movie for those who say "they don't make 'em like they use to". This proves they try once in a while.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Possibly one of the year's best film. Effective performance by Crowe and Zellweger, who pull on our heartstring for all they are worth. The movie ranks up with Howard's best films including "Apollo 13" and "A Beautiful Mind". Strongly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>This is one of those real life stories that truly is almost too good to be true, a true story that out-rocks ROCKY, with a far more likeable central character.  The tale is such a superb one that one would imagine it impossible to botch, though Ron Howard is one of the few directors capable of doing precisely that.  Luckily, Howard, despite some efforts throughout the film (of this more below), does not manage to ruin the movie, though in the end it is more accurate to say that it succeeds despite and not because of his contributions.<br /><br />I would cite three main reasons the film manages to succeed:<br /><br />1) The basic story generated by Jim Braddock himself.  His improbable comeback at the height of the Depression to win the world heavyweight championship after injuries had caused him to leave boxing to work on the shipping docks in New Jersey, when he could find work at all.  His plight would force him to go on relief at one point.  Everything would change, however, when he was offered a one-time opportunity to fight a leading contender, whose opponent had been forced to withdraw at the last second.  For Braddock, it was an opportunity to get some cash to keep his family's head above water, but when he improbably defeated the contender, he unexpectedly found himself on the comeback trail.  As any boxing fan knows, Braddock went on to defeat two other boxers in an elimination sequence for a chance to take on heavyweight champion Max Baer.  Despite the odds, Braddock went on to defeat the heavily favored Baer, who gained a reputation as one of the most savage brawlers in boxing history, though he also has a reputation for not being one of the most skilled boxers.  My favorite moment in the telling of Braddock's amazing story might be during the interview before the title bout, when he explained that unlike the first half of his career, he now had a reason to fight:  "Milk."<br /><br />2) The performances of Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti, who I have found to be two of the most consistently interesting actors of the past half decade.  Crowe's offscreen antics sometimes obscure a massive onscreen talent.  There have been times when I have thought him to be the finest screen actor of his generation, and this performance has done nothing to lower him in my estimation.  Giamatti, who plays Braddock's manager, gained great notoriety in the widespread outrage expressed when he failed to gain an Academy Award nomination either for his amazing performances of the past two years, AMERICAN SPLENDOR and SIDEWAYS.  There is an effortless intelligence in his performances that mask just how gifted he is.  There is no actor I would rather see in a movie than Giamatti, and for a while I feared his unusual appearance might keep him from the kind of roles he deserves, but luckily Hollywood seems to have recognized just how extraordinary he is, and he unexpectedly emerged as an in-demand leading man.  He will next year star in M. Night Shyamalan's next film LADY IN THE WATER.  Though there are many other excellent performances in the film, these two provide most of the reasons for watching it.  Although I'm a big Ren&eacute;e Zellweger fan, her role simply wasn't as memorable as many of her other roles.<br /><br />3) The fight sequences.  Although they do not rival the boxing action in RAGING BULL, which is likely to serve as the gold standard for some time to come, they equal or surpass anything else, and vastly surpass the absurd fight scenes in the ROCKY films.<br /><br />Still, there were some things that infuriated me in the film, primarily two.  First, Ron Howard was guilty of shameless attempted manipulation of the viewers.  What I dislike about Howard (though I confess in interviews he seems like a nice enough fella) is the way he completely disrespects the intelligence of his viewers.  He plays tricks on the audience, usually telegraphing his punches like a bad boxer.  There are a host of instances of this in the film, but I will cite only two.  First, at one point in the film Zellweger's character is tearing wood from a billboard in order to have some firewood.  In the background we see a woman running after a man, begging him not to leave her, presumably a husband who has given up the struggle to keep his family together during the Depression.  Later, under trying circumstances, Russell Crowe leaves his family's miserable apartment, and Howard frames it all so as to attempt to make us believe that she is afraid that he is leaving like the man we saw earlier.  Of course he isn't, but this is the kind of cheap manipulation that only a hack director would engage in.  The second example I would point to comes later in the film when the possibility of Max Baer killing Braddock is exaggerated to utterly ridiculous levels.  Howard isn't content for Braddock to be an underdog:  he must be in danger of dying as well!  The historical record simply doesn't support such fears, and if we ask why it appears in the film, the only answer is:  Howard is trying to make us feel a threat that didn't exist so as to further manipulate our emotions.  This is just lousy filmmaking.  I should add briefly that the photography was often sub par.  There were a lot of perplexing transition shots that simply didn't do any work, where a camera would focus for utterly no reason on, say, an iron bar, and then pull back and pan over to others.  Why?  It was if someone said, "Well, we have to get this shot started, so we'll do THIS," without any clear understanding of why.  Also, there was a lot of unsteady camerawork, which is odd in the age of the Steadicam.  Directors and cinematographers will often use a hand held camera to engender a feeling of disease and vulnerability or disorientation, but it appeared at times in this one (and not just in fight scenes) with no apparent reason.<br /><br />I was also highly disturbed by some of the attitudes expressed in the film about some of the victims of the Depression.  At one point, for instance, Braddock applies for relief to feed his family, and the woman behind the counter, with an air of moral disapproval, says, "I never expected to see you here," as if he were guilty of some ethical failure.  I found her attitude to be inexplicable.  At a time when a quarter of the workforce was unemployed, why would anyone be the object of anything except sympathy and compassion?<br /><br />Still, problems like this does not in the end keep this from being a great story.  It remains to this day one of boxing's greatest fairytales.  Who needs ROCKY when you have Jim Braddock instead?<br /><br />Trivia:  A sequence in the film shows a boxing match between Max Baer and Primo Carnera.  The latter was in his day the largest boxer ever seen, at around 6'5, 260.  His career was more or less the basis for the film THE HARDER THEY FALL, which was notable for being Humphrey Bogart's last film before succumbing to throat cancer.  Interestingly, Max Baer has a significant role in the film.  Baer's son, Max Jr., would later achieve fame playing Jethro Bodine in TV's THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>Ron Howard is a great director (love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783226810">FAR AND AWAY</a>!), but he's no brainiac when it comes to keeping facts straight. On his commentary track for CINDERELLA MAN, an often fictional bio of heavyweight champ Jim Braddock, Howard ID's an Eddie Cantor song as being by Eddie Fisher and claims that Max Baer killed two men in the ring.<br /><br />That's not true.<br /><br />One, Frankie Campbell, took a terrible beating from Max and died the next day in a hospital. Max was charged with manslaughter and acquitted. The second that Howard must be referring to is Ernie Schaaf. In their rematch, Baer beat the tar out of Schaaf, who suffered from bad headaches after this bout. He died five months later from a Primo Carnera left jab. Baer's previous thrashing may have set up the tragedy, but he didn't kill Ernie Schaaf in the ring.<br /><br />.<br />This distortion of fact is apparent in Howard's film as well. Baer's prominent Star of David has been excised from his boxing trunks, and as original footage of their 6/13/35 belt battle shows, Baer never cup-punched Braddock, never slapped him in the face, and never turned to answer Jimmy's manager and caught two sucker punches from Braddock.<br /><br />As entertainment, it works, and very well. The ring sequences are skillfully assembled, Crowe is believable as a boxer, costars Zellweger and Giamatti are both excellent and the recreation of Depression Era mid-1930s is spot-on, but for anyone with knowledge of the actual Braddock/Baer fight, this movie can get a little annoying in that last crucial sequence. Still worth seeing.<br /><br />.<br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(8.0) Cinderella Man (2005) - Russell Crowe/Ren&eacute;e Zellweger/Paul Giamatti/Craig Bierko/Bruce McGill/Rance Howard/Clint Howard/Angelo Dundee</p></br></body></html>

I do not hate this movie like say Spider Man 3 but still it's not good. Directed by Gavin Hood stars Hugh Jackman as Wolverine Liev Schreiber as Sabertooth, Danny Huston as Colonel William Stryker, Taylor Kitsch as Gambit & Lynn Collins as Kayla Silverfox. I 'm going to be honest this movie has a lot of problems. Like Wolverine & Sabertooth are brothers. Basically they join Team X & later due to questionable actions & disregard for human life Wolverine leaves moves to Canada goes under the name Logan he's lived there for 6 years with his girlfriend Kayla. Colonel Stryker tells him that people are killing members of Team X ok this could be like a Commando version of X Men. Kayla is murdered by Sabertooth Wolverine gets pwnd by Sabertooth & he's offered a way to beat him to reinforce his skeleton with adamantium. Logan overhears Stryker say erase his memory. Wolverine fights his way out & hides at a farm. Stryker has his men track him down they kill the owners of the farm. Then were introduced to Remy LeBeau or Gambit he mangles to convalesce him to take him to Stryker's main headquarters at 3 Mile Island. There Wolverine finds out Kayla wasn't killed she's been working with Stryker all along so he will release his sister. It has too many problems the stuff with Wolverine & Sabertooth being brothers wasn't needed cause all we need to know is they have this history they hate each other. Wolverine's woman working with Stryker it was 1 of those left feild things but it just didn't work for a movie. The PG 13 rating didn't help cause in Wolverine's past it's dark & violent it should've been rated R. The CGI for the claws look so fake. CGI or pactical effects when the claws came out in the other 3 movies it looked good. Wolverine losing his memory by an adamantium bullet is lazy script writing. Deadpool looks like Baraka from the MK games. I liked some of the action it has some ok fights. Gavin Hood wasn't the best choice for this movie maybe Bryan Synger could've done a better I don't know but Hood isn't capeable. Hugh Jackman was good. Danny Huston was a bad choice I'd rather had Brian Cox come back. Liev Schtaiber I didn't care for. Lynn Collins was ok. Taylor Kitsch was ok as Gambit but they should've done a better job I mean 4 movies & this was it. There going to do a 2nd Wolverine movie I hope 20th Century Fux are far away from it & it's R rated. I'm not looking forward to The 1st Class mostly cause I'm not a fan of prequels. I'd say rent it to see if you like it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>Hugh Jackman is an outstanding actor and in this film, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, he demonstrates that he can command almost every scene in a full length film. The viewer never tires of watching him overcome one conflict after another. He commands empathy from the viewer and is in virtual control of the entire film from start to finish. Playing his brother, Liev Schreiber, also demonstrates his considerable skills playing a highly threatening, violent man-beast. We do learn the origin of Wolverine as young Jimmie Logan and his brother discover the gift of an animal nature within both of them and they exercise this violent side in the US Civil War, World War I and II, and the Vietnam conflict. The special effects were outstanding. The other members of the cast were totally superior, including wise cracking Ryan Reynolds and darkly beautiful Lynn Collins. The script was a bit too predictable. However, underneath all the millions of dollars of production and talent, there is a fascinating theme embodied in Wolverine, which is the struggle between the human and savage animal nature of mankind. Wolverine struggles with this duality but part of the fascination in watching Jackman is that at some level every viewer recognizes that we are all like Wolverine, constantly struggling to maintain our higher nature and control our most violent impulses. In this story, we see Jimmie Logan maintain control and seek serenity while his brother allows every violent animalistic impulse to rise to the surface and control his actions. But it is not just his brother who demonstrates a homicidal ruthless nature. Danny Huston plays a project director who will stop at nothing to control the gifts that have been given to the mutants. This is an entertaining film. It is not full of subtle nuance and is rather straight forward story-telling. Jackman and the rest of the cast make it special.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FZA9C5MVIWHE.html">A1FZA9C5MVIWHE</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this movie. it was a bit odd to see Professor Xavier walking. I thought he would have been in a wheelchair in this movie. it was a bit odd to see Cyclops going to school as a teen and Gambit on here as well. this movie has tons of action. Hugh Jackman reprises his role as Wolverine, who was a Weapon X. it is hard to imagine, through all the X-Men cartoons I watched in my 20's, that Wolverine and Sabretooth grew up as half-brothers. there were some funny parts in this movie, such as Fred "Blob" Dukes boxing with Wolverine, however, eventually, it is the Blob that gets knocked down. I am really surprised that Magneto and Mystique were not in this movie. I recommend this movie to X-Men fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>From the production style to the acting to the music to the story... This is a mammoth and amazing film. As well executed as any of the other X-Men films... but the core is much darker and more intense. I can't recommend this film enough, it's really great. (Even the opening titles had me completely entranced and won over.)</p></br><a href="../users/A9NCQGVV5W8N0.html">A9NCQGVV5W8N0</a><br/><p>First off, I'm not what you'd call a fanboy. If you think that invalidates my opinion of this film and that's going to put you off reading this review, then so long and happy trails, pilgrim.<br /><br />That said, I know of "The X Men" - read some of the comics as a kid, can identify the characters and had soaked up some vague knowledge of "Wolverine's" origins from somewhere. I saw the first "X Men" film at the cinema (yawned and winced my way through it), saw the second one on DVD (yawned and winced my way through that as well) and unintentionally saw the third one on TV over the weekend (and actually quite enjoyed it, the change of director, the increasing moral ambiguity and the increased level of peril to the muties made for a much more enjoyable experience).<br /><br />I initially had no desire to see "Wolverine", but the change in tone of the third film made me think that there might be something in it. So I rented it.<br /><br />My Two Cents?<br /><br />Its good stuff. Let me qualify that. Its good stuff if you're in the mood for a big, dumb, CGI filled Hollywood blockbuster (which was actually filmed in NSW - go skips!) in which lots of things blow up. The fact that it's an origin tale also helped as I'm a sucker for a good origin story.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman, by his own admission, wanted to take this one to darker places and he does so with aplomb. He also has the perfect foil in Liev Schrieber's "Sabretooth", who turns out to be the catalyst that ultimately sends him down the road to becoming the man with the cuisinart claws. It has some nice twists in it and some great cameos by other mutants that I vaguely remembered from sunny afternoons spent reading Marvel comics in the back-garden as a child. There's also a deeply amusing riff on the nature of what really happened at "Three Mile Island".<br /><br />That said, I did wince twice (did we really need the glib shot of Wolfboy walking away stone-faced from an exploding helicopter or the obligatory crane shot of him looking up to the sky and yelling "NOOOOOOOOOO!!!" at the heavens? I mean, come on - those were already bad cliches when both the universe AND Dick Clark were young)<br /><br />Will you enjoy it?<br /><br />Well, take the following as a litmus test.<br /><br />I've hated all three of the "Spiderman" films, the first two "X-Men" films and the first "Hulk" movie.<br /><br />However, I really, really enjoyed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPS8">Iron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition)</a> and really enjoyed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DHXT2A">The Incredible Hulk (Three-Disc Special Edition)</a> (the one with Ed Norton where, you know, you actually got to see the Hulk smash some stuff up?) and quite enjoyed this film.<br /><br />So my cards are on the table and from them you can make your own call, hombre.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N49TOJZFG48H.html">A1N49TOJZFG48H</a><br/><p>i really enjoyed this picture . thank god for NETFLIX . i seldom pay to see a film theatrically anymore (perhaps twice a year) . a co-worker told me she really enjoyed it and recommended it . i don't watch television (as i refuse to pay for it and hate the adds and so on) . perhaps seeing less makes you appreciate stories you do see more ? dunno , but i thought it was a lot of fun and worth owning for a modest price . liked the cinematography a lot too . judge for yourself .</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>IN 1846, a pair of young mutant boys named James and Victor murdered their abusive father with their abilities and run away to go off to many wars over the years as they don't age like regular people and are sort of immortal. From the Civil War to Vietnam in the 70's, James a.k.a. Logan (Huge Jackman) and his big brother nicknamed Sabretooth (Liv Schriber) have joined a secret government agency task force. But after killing innocent people in Nigeria, six years later he decides to make a better life in the Canadian rockies with a beautiful girlfriend Kayla(Lynn Collins) and with a job. However after Kayla was murdered, Logan particaptes in a experiment involving a rare indestructable metal called adamantium as it makes his skeleton and claws even more powerful then ever. He still retains his powers of immortality and self-healing as now he vows revenge on his brother and those that killed his true love, but it seems Stryker is kidnapping mutants and using them for experiments. He teams up with a Cajun mutant with unique explosive powers named Gambit a.k.a. Remy Labeau (Taylor Kitsch) and John Wraith (Will I.Am) who's powers include teleporting as they must find the mutants to free them.<br /><br />Entertaining and action-packed prequel to the X-Men saga is a fascinating film. This one sets itself 15 years before the first movie as it tells us how Wolverine became to be the savage hero he is today and a little history that it adapts the graphic novel "Wolverine: ORIGINS" quite well on the screen. The mutants from the comics are here such as Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), Chris Bradley (Dominic Morgan), The Blob (Kevin Durad), Agent Zero (Daniel Henney), a young Scott Summers a.k.a. Cyclops (Tim Pocock) and an appearence by Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier. This is very entertaining but not a masterpiece like the first X-Men movies and the third movie wasn't bad as the fans proclaimed it was, this one manages to improve over that one and gave us a look of how Logan became to be long before he was a member of the X-Men.<br /><br />This 3-Disc Blu-Ray has flawless picture and sound that blows the viewer out of their seats and the extras are terrific such as featurettes, audio commentaries, Files on the characters, Fox Movie Channel World Premiere featurette, a look at the Helicopter chase, a unique X-Mode Bonus view, a bonus standard def DVD and a digital copy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>I have been an X-Men fan since I was a child. Wolverine was always the toughest one around and he carried an attitude to match. Hugh Jackman plays the role to perfection and this movie is a great synopsis of the origins of one of the X-Men and one of my personal favorite characters.<br /><br />Wolverine and his brother are invincible warriors and their amazing healing powers make these mutants able to heal quickly, stay in the fight and maybe even immortal! The US government uses them and modifies them to enhance their fighting capabilities and the result is scary. Wolverine is out for vengeance and no one had better stand in his way.<br /><br />Wolverine's brother is played by Liev Schreiber who does a wonderful job fulfilling the role as a real bad dude without many moral ethics of doing whatever he wants to win. He makes a good villain to Wolverine's vision quest to regain his lost past. In the end Sabertooth, (Liev Schreiber) does just enough to help his brother against a common foe!<br /><br />I love this movie for the storyline and the great special effects. It helps you to understand Wolverine's personality, special skills and his amnesia about his past. I hope the X-Men saga continues in more movie releases. They are great!</p></br><a href="../users/A132ETQPMHQ585.html">A132ETQPMHQ585</a><br/><p>Love Xmen movies....DVD..........X-Men Origins: Wolverine - Ultimate 3-Disc Edition (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy)....great series wanted to own them all....would buy again...</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`X-Men Origins: Wolverine' is pretty much as the title suggests, a film looking at the back story of Wolverine and how he came by his Adamantium skeleton. This also looks at his relationship with his brother, who is excellently played by Liev Schreiber, after they fight in numerous wars together and then become estranged after becoming mutant mercenaries. Jackman plays this just like the other X-Men films, all gruff and angry and there is no real nuance to his acting, but for a gutsy, all action role you don't really need tenderness or finesse. There are plenty of fights and explosions here to keep action fans pleased and this also ties in the later films and introduces some of the characters we are to meet down the line. The story is pretty formulaic and you can guess nearly all the twists and turns from the outset, but for a reasonably decent action film and a worthy addition to the X-Men franchise this isn't too bad at all. This is good but not great.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q.html">A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q</a><br/><p>X-Men Origins: Wolverine is full of characters. Most of which have less than 5 minutes of screen time. The cast includes: Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Liev Schreiber as Sabretooth, Kevin Durand (LOST) as Blob, Dominic Monaghan as Bolt, Taylor Kitsch as Gambit, Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool, and Tim Pocock as Cyclops. Plus many many more.<br /><br />But like I said most characters are a fleeting guest. This movie revolves around Wolverine vs Sabertooth vs William Stryker. An officer who is trying to "build" a team of super-humans. I quote the term build because it's a plot device. I don't want to spoil the film if you haven't seen it.<br /><br />The movie shows Sabretooth and Wolverine to be related. They both survive multiple wars until they are recruited by Stryker.<br /><br />Things have a way of going bad and Wolverine quits.<br /><br />Flash forward a few years and someone is killing off the team of super-humans on Stryker's team.<br /><br />But there's more to Stryker than building a team.<br /><br />This film has some cussing in it. The violence is PG-13 which means there's hardly any blood (if any). There's no sexual content except for a scene with Wolverine and his girlfriend? resting in bed.<br /><br />X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a good summer eye-candy flick. Some of the diehard fans of certain characters won't be happy with what was done to their favorites, but I thought it was a fun film.<br /><br />Be sure to stick around after the credits for a short scene.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>I was never a fan of the X-Men comic books, but X-Men is probably the best action hero/comic book movie out there. Unlike many other such movies, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ICLRIO">Fantastic Four [Blu-ray</a>], which are simply an excuse to have a bunch of action scenes and special effects, X-Men actually has a well-developed plot, good acting, as well as impressive special effects. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan as the two main mutants make the movie, are fantastic add emotional depth, but X-Men also includes a strong supporting cast, including Hugh Jackman and Hallie Berri. Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised by X-Men. Definitely worth checking out, even if you're not usually into this type of movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2.html">A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2</a><br/><p>Director Gavin Hood pulls together an enjoyable, if not especially profound, survey of the most popular X-Man's missing years.  Moving mainly in fits and starts through most of two centuries, it shows how a sickly young boy becomes an angry fighter, shrugs off mortal wounds, and loses interest in being alive.  And then, at the last moment, he rediscovers what he believes in--and it costs him everything.<br /><br />Hood teases out little hints dropped in the prior movies, turning disconnected images into a coherent narrative.  Though nothing particularly surprising or revelatory takes place, the film at least acquits itself with a number of good set pieces, a realistic science fiction conflict and rationally motivated characters.  It does a good job setting up where Wolverine came from, and opening doors for where he might go.<br /><br />And the acting is strong.  Hugh Jackman proves once again that he's able to carry off an action hero who suffers the full range of human emotions.  Danny Huston's Colonel Stryker is smart but in love with his own intelligence.  And who knew brainy Liev Schreiber could hulk out and play such a powerful villain?  If there's a real shock in this film, it's a  previously unseen side of Schreiber.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is good.  While it lacks the moving intensity of the first two X-Men movies, it entertains and engages, pulling viewers through a story that keeps us hooked as we wait to see secrets revealed.  X-Men fans and action movie devotees will find plenty to like in this fun, muscular film.</p></br><a href="../users/A26R4PDCZX5SOK.html">A26R4PDCZX5SOK</a><br/><p>Wow! 5 of 5 stars for this X-men movie! Great story, great characters, extremely well created movie! Action, sci-fi, characters, scenses, wow! OK, I am a fan of the X-men series of movies (1 to 3). Now this installment gives the history of the key character Wolverine, from young kid just discovering his mutant skills to his time at war (from WWI to Viet Nam). This is a must watch movie; oh, Blu-Ray makes a big difference!! This is now on my favorite movie list!</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>"X-Men Origins: Wolverine" got bashed pretty hard by critics when it opened, and I won't deny that it's not in a league with "X-Men 2" or "The Dark Knight" (what other comic book-based films are?), but viewing it on DVD, I found that I really wasn't disappointed in it, with much of the credit going to Hugh Jackman. He has such charisma and intensity that when he's onscreen, I find that plotholes don't bother me nearly as much...and this is certainly his best performance as Wolverine, yet.<br /><br />If anything, the film is guilty of trying to accomplish too much; trying to answer all of the questions raised in the first three films nearly guarantees that some depth will have to be sacrificed (and the filmmakers were well aware that this could well be the last film of the franchise, and wanted to tie up loose ends). But what emerges isn't just a resolution, but a new chapter, as well, with new characters (Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool and Taylor Kitsch as Gambit are standouts), a love interest you actually cared about (Lynn Collins), and a terrific love/hate relationship between Logan and his brother, Victor/Sabertooth (Liev Schreiber). I won't deny, though, it was fun seeing Patrick Stewart, again, briefly reprising his role as Professor Xavier (and looking more youthful, thanks to CGI).<br /><br />From a boyhood discovering his 'gifts' in the Canadian Rockies of the 1840s, to an explosive 1970s climax at Three-Mile Island (ah, the real reason for the near melt-down!), the Wolverine saga certainly deserves more than a one-film 'wrap', but it is fun!<br /><br />Two Special Features are worth your attention, as well; a conversation between 'Wolverine' creater Len Wein and 'X-Men' creator Stan Lee is light-hearted and entertaining, with both giving sincere credit to Jack Kirby and Chris Clarement's involvement; and the 'Making Of' featurette is an often funny look of Jackman's total commitment to an exercise/diet regimen to be as 'bulked' as possible as Wolverine. He ends the piece with the hope that fans like the latest entry enough that he can play the role again, as he loves the character.<br /><br />I really hope he gets his wish!</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>Finally they made a movie about wolverine and Gambit is finally in an X-Men Movie.

And surprise!  The film is not that bad.  Yes, it is corny and rather geared to young impressionable audiences, but the surprise is that the actors participating in this very slow weak script by David Benioff and Skip Woods seem to believe in it - or at least tongue in cheek have a good time with all the gimmicks built in to this story about the creation of mutants.  Gavin Hood directs the chaos.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman takes the lead, struggling against his darker brother of special traits Liev Schreiber and the audience actually hollers for the good guy/bad guy encounters.  It really helps this very long film to add the always reliable gifted comedian  cum Adonis Ryan Reynolds to the recipe: his time is far to short as he seems to be able to balance the comic book idea against the 'real drama' flavor the story needs. Danny Huston likewise makes the most of the head bad guy, maintaining a dignity that makes his role more credible.  Taylor Kitsch adds some interest as a newcomer and Lynn Collins does her best to toss in a bit of love life to the soup.<br /><br />But it is a film for CGI lovers and that audience will likely not be disappointed.  The idea of justifying the beginnings of a comic book hero grows old, but at least we don't have to worry about a prequel to this one!  See it for Jackman, Reynolds and Schreiber -lots of flash and pizZazz and set destruction in addition to their inherent star quality values.  Grady Harp, June 10</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>With the X-Men films becoming too expensive to feature all its stars, it has become more logical to focus on the storyline of each of the main characters.  And what best than to feature one of the more popular characters in the Marvel and X-Men universe, Wolverine.<br /><br />Taking the helm as director is actor, Gavin Hood ("Thug", "The Storekeeper" and "Stas and Nel Adventures"), with a screenplay by David Bennioff ("The Kite Runner", "Troy") and Skip Woods ("Hitman" and "Swordfish").  Joining the men is composer Harry Gregson-Williams ("Deja Vu", "Shrek the Third" and "Gone Baby Gone") and cinematographer Donald McAlpine ("The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe", "Peter Pan", "Anger Management" and "Moulin Rouge!").<br /><br />"X-Men Origins: Wolverine", the Blu-ray Ultimate 2-Disc Edition comes with two discs.  The main disc is the Blu-ray, while the second disc is a digital copy.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"X-Men Origins: Wolverine" is presented in 1080p High Definition with an AVC @ 22MBPS.  The picture quality is quite solid with the skin pores of both Hugh Jackman and Liev Schrieber coming quite nicely on the HD transfer.  The grittiness, the sweat, the grime,  the vibrancy is also well-captured in the film.  Blacks are nice and deep and with the film being shot outdoors, the areas that Logan visit are quite detailed. I didn't see any compression artifacts or major scratches or dust on the video transfer.<br /><br />The audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (also English, Spanish and Portuguese 5.1 Dolby Digital and French 5.1 DTS).  The lossless audio track is absolutely awesome.  From Zero's gunfire, Logan's adamantium claws making the "snickt" sound, Wade's swords as it deflects the bullets and Victor's attacks and his growls, it's all captured and sounds incredible.  Also, there are plenty of action-scenes that really showcase the surround channels and a good amount of LFE is utilized.  From the explosions to the gunfire, home theater owners should be happy with the Blu-ray lossless soundtrack as some scenes sound quite immersive.<br /><br />As expected, Twentieth Century Fox has done a great job with the video and audio transfer for "X-Men Origins: Wolverine".  Subtitles are presented in English SDH, Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin and Portuguese.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />"X-Men Origins: Wolverine" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  * Commentary by Gavin Hood - Audio Commentary by the director Gavin Hood.  For the most part, Hood does a great job in providing the details to the film.  A very informative audio commentary.<br />  * Commentary by Producers Laura Schuler Donner and Ralph Winter - There are some interesting details about certain scenes and what went on to create those scenes via the producers perspective.  The only problem is that Donner and Winter have too many silent moments in where they are not talking.  So, it can be a bit distracting.<br />  * The Roots of Wolverine: A Conversation with Stan Lee and Len Wien - (16:16) Both Stan Lee and Len Wien discuss the X-Men, Wolverine as a character, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and the history of the character. An informative featurette in regards to the comic books.  For some reason, I felt that Stan Lee was not his jovial self.<br />  * Wolverine Unleashed: The Complete Origins - (12:02) Interviews with the director, producers, Hugh Jackman in regards to shooting the film, origins of Wolverine, training, making his claws and the set.<br />  * Weapon X Files - This segment features each talent in character talking about themselves and then we hear from the director/producer about what they wanted to accomplish with their character and special effects that went into the making of that character.  Probably my favorite was the featurette on Kevin Durand's Blob and what went into making the fat suit.<br /><br />- Victor Creed/Sabretooth (7:25)<br /><br />- William Stryker (4:25)<br /><br />- John Wraith (4:15)<br /><br />- Kayla Silverfox (3:26)<br /><br />- Fred Dukes/Blob (7:18)<br /><br />- Bradley (3:18)<br /><br />- Remy Lebeau/Gambit (9:08)<br /><br />- Agent Zero (3:45)<br /><br />- Wade Wilson/Deadpool (7:10)<br /><br />- Emma (Kayla's Sister) (3:25)<br /><br />  * The Thrill of the Chase: The Helicopter Sequence - (5:53) The making of the helicopter sequence.<br />  * Ultimate X-Mode - While watching the film, viewers can watch the director, producers and cast talking about the film via picture-in-picture.<br />  * Deleted & Alternate Scenes - (9:30) With optional commentary by director Gavin Hood, Hood introduces four deleted and alternate scenes which include: Young Storm, Victor at the boxing ring, Alternate Memory Erase Sequence and a Japanese Bar Scene.<br />  * Fox Movie Channel Presents: World Premiere - (6:20) The "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" debut in Tempe, Arizona (The contest winners of where the red carpet premiere took place).<br />  * X-Men on Blu-ray: Trailers for X-Men Trilogy and "Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian".<br />  * BD-Live Lookup - With a BD-Live enabled Blu-ray player, viewers can access up-to-date information on actor filmographies, information related to "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" on imdb (The Internet Movie Database).<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I literally grew up with the "X-Men" and "Wolverine" comic books when I was younger.  During the 80's, you had your American superheroes but Wolverine represented a character that was just exciting, deadly and literally kickass.<br /><br />Since the release of the three X-Men films, I have no doubt in my mind that Hugh Jackman was the best casting decision made for the character.  He embodies the character completely and the amount of discipline he puts in working out and being Logan is just incredible and it shows in "X-Men Origins: Wolverine".<br /><br />For the most part, the film is full of action and full of characters.  The excitement is there, the killer instinct of both Logan and Victor are there and of course, we have pre-Deadpool Wade Wilson in the film as well, along with many other characters that makes this film fun and exciting.  And to feature a storyline that revolves around Logan's origin is not easy.  After all, having followed the comic books for so long, I think even writers had their challenge of how the Weapon X program would be and even today, just seeing how things have evolved with the program is just staggering.  So, before watching the film, I did have my reservations of how muddled the plot could be.<br /><br />Fortunately, the filmmakers took a different approach and created their own storyline with some aspects of the comic book still part of the storyline.  Keeping things simple and for the most part, for those who are not familiar with the comic books, at least exciting enough to understand where Logan came from and why he and Victor have had this dysfunctional relationship.<br /><br />For the most part, Jackman is just great as Logan/Wolverine and Liev Schreiber can always play the definitive bad ass.  Danny Huston as Stryker was quite effective and Lynn Collins as Kayla Silverfox did a great job as well.  As for Taylor Kitsch ("Friday Night Lights") as Remy Lebeau/Gambit, that was quite interesting but for the most part, I felt that Kitsch did a good job albeit the thick French accent that Gambit exhibits in the comic books and people are so used to hearing from the X-Men animated series.  The others have small roles such as "LOST" and "Lord of the Rings" actor Dominic Monaghan as Bradley and Black Eyed Peas member Will.i.am also ventures to the acting world, appearing onscreen (instead of voice as he did in "Madagascar 2').  But one of the exciting parts of this film was seeing the Blob (Kevin Durand) and of course, Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds).  It was great to see on the Blu-ray of how they came up with the Blob's outfit and of course, having Wade Wilson in the film.  It's important to note that if you are a fan of Wade Wilson, make sure you watch through the ending credits.<br /><br />With all my gushing about how much I enjoy this film, one must wonder if I have any negatives.  Well, what I didn't like about the film was the overuse of CG, in which some scenes looked a bit too unrealistic.  Also, the tweaking of the Wade Wilson character was a bit too much for my taste.  I can understand some hardcore fans who may have a problem with the comic book continuity and how the film has quite a few differences but personally, many super hero films has its differences from its comic book counterpart that its not surprising anymore.  As long as the soul of the characters are intact and the storyline is well-presented, it's good enough for me.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, the film definitely gets a wonderful HD transfer as picture and audio quality is solid.  A good number of special features are included, as well as a slipcase and a digital copy of the film.<br /><br />With that being said, "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" is a good superhero film with a lot of action.  Was it as deep and entertaining like "The Dark Knight Returns", my answer is no.  But I definitely enjoyed it more than the third X-Men film and even the "Hulk" related films.  I felt that the storyline focused on Logan/Wolverine, his rivalry with Victor Creed quite well.  If anything, it's the CG that tends to be overdone at times that bothered me a bit but for the most part, I did enjoy watching the film.<br /><br />But after watching the awesome Blu-ray version and seeing the film in High Definition and watching the special features, that actually enhanced my perspective towards the film.  A lot went into the making of this film and to see that Hugh Jackman did most of his own stunts, that is incredible.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a fan of Wolverine and the previous X-Men films, definitely give "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" a try.  Definitely worth recommending!</p></br><a href="../users/A18CMGIQZ1OAA2.html">A18CMGIQZ1OAA2</a><br/><p>i love the comics. x mens always been my favorite series other than when i was little and i was all about superman. All the xmen movies are different than the comics. theyre comic inspired action movies BUT i love em. hugh jackman is so cool. Hes an awesome adaptation of wolverine. In this one i loved how they pulled in scott without really pulling him into it. I really like liev shreiber and was happy they picked him to play a young sabretooth. It was a fun movie. i watched it in two settings so im not giving it a full 5l Lets face it if it was the best thing ever i would have watched it all the way through.  Like all the others, when you match up this to Xmen first class which timewise fall close things just dont add up but like i said not to think on much. Not my favorite but the last comic movie i saw was Green Lantern and haha anythings a step up from that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>The Canuck who goes "snikt" is back and in his own feature film, and my tepid reaction goes along the lines of "Um.. oh.. huh." X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE is serviceable enough, but in no way does it elevate the X-Men film franchise to new heights. There's always peril in disclosing a character's mysterious past, that the doing of it may possibly sabotage the character's existing appeal. Sometimes, things are better left alone, better left to the viewer's imaginations lest the reality not live up to all the fun speculations. In having long-withheld details from his murky past finally revealed, Wolverine ends up being less interesting. And the big, exciting reveals end up not so big, not so exciting. For a vehicle featuring a mutant berserker who's the best at what he does - which is fighting - X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE lacks punch.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman isn't bad as Logan. Okay, I had to get over the fact that Logan in the comic books stands at only 5'3," and not 6'2," which is Jackman's height. Because, for me, part of Wolverine's appeal is that he's often the smallest runt in the place and still he tears  up the shizzy. Another thing is that Jackman doesn't quite convincingly demonstrate that utterly berserko rage that Logan succumbs to. So, not feral enough, vicious enough, scruffy enough, or, yeah, smelly enough. Hugh Jackman isn't bad as Logan. But he's too, I dunno, elegant? Tame?<br /><br />The film begins somewhen in 1845, which is when young James Howlett's (Wolverine/Logan's real name) mutant abilities first truly kick in. We note James' popping of his retractable bone claws, the tragedy in his home, the panicked dash thru the woods, the show of togetherness by Victor Creed, James' older half-brother, and then we're off to the opening credits to catch brief glimpses of James and Victor adventuring thru various wars down the decades. Thru the years Victor (a very good Liev Shreiber) becomes increasingly bestial and amoral and you could see James growing more and more concerned about this. It was never gonna end well between the two. If you read the X-Men titles, you know this, that Wolverine and Sabertooth are the bitterest of enemies.<br /><br />In telling Logan's story, the movie skips key junctures in his past, or since this is the movie version, maybe Logan simply never did venture to Madripoor or get married in Japan. During 'Nam, we do see him and Victor being handpicked by Colonel Stryker for Team X, a black ops unit peopled with hardened mutants. We witness Stryker's interest in the rare metal alloy known as adamantium, and we fans know how adamantium impacts Wolverine later on. The movie cherry picks (and sometimes throws a curve on) elements from the Wolverine mythos. We follow Logan as he encounters Silverfox and later undergoes the excruciatingly painful Weapon X experiment. The film peppers in various superhero scuffles as Wolverine and Sabertooth separately throw down with various mutants, all this culminating in a showdown on Three Mile Island. But the disappointing thing is that most of the action sequences don't get you up as they should.<br /><br />I get the sense that Gambit and especially Deadpool were spotlighted with eventually having them star in their own movies in mind. Except that Taylor Kitsch underwhelms as Remy LeBeau. On the other hand, Ryan Reynolds as the mouthy merc Wade Wilson is very promising. Ryan Reynolds is at his scene-stealing best and, in one scene, as Wade Wilson furiously deflects bullets with his flashing swords, he solidifies himself as the baddest dude in a roomful of bad dudes. So I'm sold on the Deadpool movie. Actually, that whole sequence in which Team X invades a well-defended structure in Lagos, Nigeria counts as the most scintillating action sequence in the film. However, what they later do to Deadpool is just too much. I also wasn't down with the out-of-left-field reimagining of Blob. A fun thing, though, is that I once again get to play the "Identify that Cameo" game. Most prominent are a young Cyclops and Emma Frost. But see if you could pick out the others.<br /><br />The movie gives us a momentary glimpse of Logan being happy, the operative word being "momentary." We see Logan suffering a tragic loss and giving in to his inner rage and losing his inhibitions. And yet, as portrayed by Hugh Jackman, when Wolverine loses it, in my eyes, he doesn't lose it enough. The PG-13 rating may also be to blame for this. Word is that a sequel is already underway. I'm crossing my fingers for an Alpha Flight sighting.<br /><br />Lastly, Wade Wilson just cracks me up. Mouthy as he is, he doesn't really get a chance to mouth off. However, he does manage to get on Sabertooth's bad side when he observes that Sabertooth has the "fingernails of a bag lady."</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>After three movies of amnesia and claw-slashing, Wolverine is actually getting his own movie, all for his own. Sure, some familiar characters appear, but the stage is for him alone.<br /><br />And it's neither a horrendous movie nor a good one -- just a popcorn collection of explosions and Matrixian fight scenes, linked together by a rather loosely-strung plot that doesn't have any twists or unexpected events. Hugh Jackman does a simply stellar job as the beclawed titular character and it has some funny moments, but the part of the movie that galvanized me the most was the trailer for "District 9."<br /><br />After a century of fighting, James Logan (Jackman) and his savage half-brother Victor (Liev Schreiber) are recruited by a mysterious army officer, William Stryker (Danny Huston), to join his elite mutant squad. Logan is sick of killing, so he tries to have the quiet life with his girlfriend Kayla (Lynn Collins) as a humble logger... until Victor reappears and murders Kayla, as part of a vendetta against his old teammates. Intent on revenge, Logan accepts the offer Stryker gives him -- he will accept a horrible and painful procedure that will make him invincible, so he can kill Victor.<br /><br />With an adamantium skeleton and an instantly-healing body, the newly-renamed Wolverine is invincible -- but he soon finds himself on the run not only from his older brother, but from Stryker's ruthless military forces. Now he must uncover a mysterious "island" that only one mutant has ever escaped from... except there are some other nasty surprises waiting for him there, courtesy of Stryker's experiments.<br /><br />By all rights, "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" should have been a far better movie than it is. But the story itself is only so-so -- it's rather straightforward in its narrative without many twists, and the Sabretooth/Wolverine backstory is handled pretty confusingly. It's only in the last quarter that the movie really acquires that epic comic-book feeling -- up until then, it's a rather bland you-killed-my-master/relative/truelove-REVENGE! tale.<br /><br />So with a bland plot, they slather on the action -- it feels like at least 75% of the movie was written to allow maximum explosions, motorcycle chases, Matrixian wire-fu, and endless claw fights. In fact, the movie is at its best when it has either some really tightly-wound fight scenes (such as the boxing match with The Blob), or a sense of humour (Wolverine accidentally destroys a nice little elderly couple's bathroom, and walks out repentantly holding their sink).<br /><br />And then there's Wolverine himself -- he can heal from anything, and his metal skeleton means he can't even be chopped up. In other words, he's indestructible. It's really hard to worry about the guy physically, and "Origins" never gets around to making us fear that he'll lose anything else.<br /><br />So it's a credit to Jackman's talent that he actually makes us care about Wolverine -- roaring, confused, grief-stricken, and slowly being hardened by all the betrayals and lies. And Schreiber does an excellent job as well, especially considering that Sabretooth is as likable as an ingrown nail -- he actually almost makes us feel sorry for his character now and then. Too bad we never, uh, really figure out why he wants to kill his brother.<br /><br />And there's a lot of great lesser roles as well -- Collins does a decent job considering her total lack of chemistry with Jackman, while the coldly contemptuous Daniel Henney, kindly will.i.am, charming gambler Kitsch and puckish Dominic Monaghan all do great jobs with their smaller-scale roles. Huston is okay, but he never quite seems scary or fanatical enough.<br /><br />"X-Men Origins: Wolverine" has enough explosions, stunts and elaborate aerial fight scenes to shame most blockbusters, but it's lacking heart and plot. The thing that makes it worth watching: the actors.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Logan Hugh Jackman) and his brother Victor (Live Schreiber), long-lived mutants with amazing powers of healing, go from close siblings to deadly enemies, eventually facing off in a huge battle that involves lots of other mutants as well.<br /><br />A lot of people hate this movie, but I thought it was pretty good.  Jackman remains the perfect embodiment of Wolverine and Schreiber makes a scary Sabretooth.  It covers a lot of ground and none of it is great filmmaking, but it provides a lively and entertaining history for the character and has plenty of good action scenes.

This prequel to the Marvel Comics` "X-Men" franchise is otherwise a pretty tepid affair, lacking the sharp sociopolitical underpinnings that so distinguished the first installment in the series (the franchise has been in steady decline since that stunning opening salvo).<br /><br />It's true that Logan is a bit of a tortured soul in this film - he just wants to be left alone to live his life as a lumberjack with his beautiful girlfriend by his side, but no one will let him - but it's an inner conflict without much emotional resonance or dramatic impact.  The reluctant mutant is up against not only his own brother, Victor, but Stryker, the de facto mad scientist who's kidnapping all the other mutants so he can perform diabolical experiments on them.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine, while the roles of Victor and Stryker have been taken over by Liev Schreiber and Danny Houston, respectively.  The movie also features Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Kitsch (from "Friday Night Lights"), Dominic Monaghan (from "Lost") and Will.i.am in relatively minor roles.<br /><br />The action sequences are well-done from a technical standpoint, but they would be a great deal more compelling if we understood just how vulnerable or invulnerable each character was at any given moment in the drama (their status seems to swing wildly back and forth depending on the individual scene and circumstance).</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>This movie brings back good memories of the Barry Windsor-Smith miniseries and uses advances in special effects to bring out the spirit of the Wolverine comic character.  Hugh Jackman is an adequate Wolverine without the growl but Liev Schreiber made Sabretooth interesting and attractive when the comic character is completely offensive and odious.  The miscasting of Gambit was the biggest problem with this purely entertaining movie.  Gambit is supposed to look like a young Clint Eastwood including the cheroot and the lovely pompadour.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LSDDSM4PGOU5.html">A1LSDDSM4PGOU5</a><br/><p>for me,this is the worst movie i have seen connected with the X-Men franchise.it's certainly watchable,but it's not up to the X Men standard.i found it slow at times.also,there are some continuity issues regarding this Wolverine and the Wolverine we see in the later X-Men movies as well as with the events themselves and how they play out in the later movies.Hugh Jackman was Fine as Wolverine,as he always has been.Liev Schrieber is good as Victor Creed.and i really liked Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool.i just wish he had a bigger role.as for the movie as a whole,it is above average,but as i said,not up to the X-Men standard.for me, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a 3/5</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>well,for 2009,it was between this movie,the t4 and watchmen for movie of the year and this one lost.i liked it.dont get me wrong.its just that there were a bunch of errors.i guess i should expect that since not one comic book movie has been accurate yet.<br />  most of this movie was in the x-men trilogy.so all the answers were taken care of already.sabretooth was actualy wolverines dad.im pretty sure the xmen were the original mutant team.wolverine was dropped with one bullet in xmen 2 but absorbs hundreds in the first few minutes of this film.this dead pool guy showed up much later i thought too.<br />  these facts aside,the movie was pretty cool.the opening fight scenes were memorable.how old wolverine is ,is staggering.the action is cool.dead pool is awesome.there are a few lesser known mutants all through it in the later parts.<br />  this movie rocked!id give it second place for 2009 behind the watchmen and slightly above terminator salvation.</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a worthless entry in this popular movie series adapted from the classic Marvel superhero team.  In short:  The movie is a simple, soulless action movie that really doesn't give justice to its primary characters.  No character ever has a chance to develop a distinct personality, and we only understand Logan because of the fact that he has been a key player in three other films.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is a wonderful, very promising actor who is somewhat typecast as Wolverine at this point -somewhat sad since he's had many better performances- but he never is really given a chance to display his acting talent a single time in this film.  This movie is a rock'em sock'em with no point to it other than the filmmakers wondering how many action scenes they can jam pack into its short running time.<br /><br />The point of the film seemed to be someone asking "How many mutants can we stuff into a single X-Men movie?" and then they just went from there.  Instead of actually giving us a chance to learn more about the character of Wolverine we end up with 90-minutes of pure action and zero in the way of character development.<br /><br />Now I know summer movies are supposed to be big, dumb fun, but when we had two great movies (X-Men, X2) building up this film's title character the result is his origin isn't nearly as interesting, or exciting as those films would have lead us to believe.<br /><br />The film is built on clich&eacute;s and has no interesting characters.  I would recommend skipping this film if you want to preserve the mystery of the Wolverine character you were given in the first films, because this "Origin Story" is bound to seriously disappoint you.  And even if you're seeking a mindless action movie I would recommend renting this movie because it is not worth anything more than five-dollars.</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>This is the story of how Wolverine came into existence starting with his childhood and the discovery of his mutant powers. It tracks him and his brother, also a mutant, who share many adventures over an extended period of time and develops the basic difference between the two brothers.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman plays the part of the character who will become Wolverine with a balance of aggression and compassion. The story carries the Wolverine character from childhood to the point of introducing Professor Charles Xavier and the hope of sanctuary for the mutants.<br /><br />This is first and foremost an action adventure that should please fans of the X-Men series. The sound and picture are excellent with plenty of surround sound to immerse the viewer in the action.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the X-Men movies it is very likely you will enjoy this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />After a cool opening credit sequence (that adds this film, along with other luminaries like America's Sweethearts, to the list of films that peak before 10 minutes have elapses) Wolverine devolves into a rather bland "origin story" that's made even more redundant by the fact that those of us who have seen the first three X-men movies know exactly where things are going; though Jackman and (especially) Schrieber give it their all, there's not a lot here to like.<br /><br />2.5/4</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>Having known Wolverine since his first appearance in The Incredible Hulk issue #181, which I bought at my local magazine store for 25 cents! I know official issue #180 is the first appearance, but one panel hardly counts as an appearance. 'X-Men Origins Wolverine' is bound to raise a few eyebrows on hard core fans because of the reworking of the original story. Origins are tough with super heroes because they try to squeeze 20 to 80 years of hero history into a film that runs two hours or less.<br /><br />I enjoyed Wolverine for the most part, but I was confused at times not knowing some of the heroes from their comic counter parts on screen. The action sequences are very cool and the story moves along smoothly for the most part, but in the end it seemed like it could have been better. It's not the worst super hero film, but it's not the best either. I liked the X-Men movies, but none of them are as well thought out as any on the Spider-Man films...yes including Spider-Man 3!<br /><br />The single disc edition has the movie and some trailers so for fans of the character I think you might want to buy the two discs edition. The DVD transfer looks very good!</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>There are really two good reasons to watch "X-Men Origins: Wolverine"; Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber as, respectively, Wolverine and Sabretooth. Schreiber's performance is especially noteworthy since he's probably the best villain I have seen in an X - Men film since Ian McKellen's wicked, quite twisted, take on Magneto. Indeed, in almost every scene, Schreiber almost steals the spotlight from Jackman. Replete with great action adventure sequences, this film sags a bit in discussing the origins of Wolverine and his conflicted relationship with his half-brother Sabretooth, whom we meet first in the desolate wildnerness of Canada's Northwest Territories, sometime in the mid 1840s (We see next a thrilling montage of both brothers servicing in the USA's armed forces from the Civil War through Vietnam and beyond.). Another compelling reason to see "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" is Danny Huston's creepy performance as Colonel Stryker, who finds himself as both mentor and sinister overlord to both X-Men. Have no doubt that diehard fans of the "X-Men" series will enjoy this film, especially for the fine screen chemistry between Jackman and Schreiber, but I also suspect that those unfamiliar with this classic comic book series may feel a bit underwhelmed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>I like the Wolverine character. He's one of the original anti-heroes and is revered worldwide as an all out badass of ridiculous proportion. Apart from in a recent series of comics, the origins of the Wolverine character have never really been discussed so a movie about those origins I can imagine was a bit of a surprise for fans when it was announced. The real question being, just how are they going to take on the origins of such a complex character in the Marvel universe? Let's be honest it wasn't going to be an easy task. This film acts not just as a prequel to the X-Men trilogy of films but also as a stand alone film to give the fans of the X-Men films an idea of the history of this character and just how exactly he came to be.<br /><br />Starting off in 1845 a young James Howlett witnesses the murder of his father by groundskeeper Thomas Logan. Shocked and angry, James' mutation (bone claws) is activated and he attacks and kills Logan. With his last breath Logan reveals that he is James' biological father. James flees the home with Logan's abused son Victor Creed and they both promise each other that they will always have each others back. Fast forward to when they are adults and they are approached by a young William Stryker who offers them a chance to join Team X. The brothers join but soon their questionable actions cause James to leave the group.<br /><br />6 years later, James is now known as Logan and is living with his girlfriend in Canada. He is approached by Stryker who warns him that someone is killing off each member of the original team. Victor is the one killing off the members and he is the one that kills Logan's girlfriend leading them into a brutal sibling rivalry. Stryker offers Logan a way of defeating Creed, joining the weapon X programme which will reinforce Logan's bones with the indestructible Adamantium. When Stryker attempts to wipe Logan's memory during the procedure Logan breaks free and vows to take revenge on Stryker and Victor. Logan needs to find Stryker's hidden laboratory known as "The Island" and he must enlist the help of the famous X-Man, Remy LeBeau (Gambit).<br /><br />The characters in the film are a very welcome additional fantasy and comic element to the X-Men movie universe. In the X films the characters, although maintaining the fantasy element, were a bit too serious for their own good. In this, in my opinion, they have taken on a more comic book element similar to the newest comic book movies such as Incredible Hulk and Iron Man. The characters don't take themselves too seriously which, in a film like this, is always a good thing. Hugh Jackman reprises his role as Wolverine and although I did enjoy him in the X-Men films, I found he struggled slightly to keep my interest in the character for the entirety of the film.  Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed (Sabretooth to the comic fans) was an inspired choice and I have to say a much preferred one to Tyler Mane who played the character in the X-Men movies. They both had a fantastic chemistry together during their fight scenes and general acting together. The brotherhood seems believable and it makes the film work when they are beating the hell out of each other.<br /><br />The other interesting characters that made this film work wonders are mainly the ones involved in Team X mainly displayed at the start of the film and, of course, the legendary Gambit. Ryan Reynolds made this film an enjoyable and light hearted piece of work as the character Wade Wilson or Deadpool to others. The funny one liners and general character demeanour made me wonder why Reynolds didn't have a larger part to play in the film as a whole. I can't help but think that the film would have been a bigger success in terms of critical ratings had he obtained a higher prominence in the film. Taylor Kitsch as Gambit achieves his goal of portraying the coolness of the character well, but doesn't match up to the brilliance of the comic interpretation. The young William Stryker played by Danny Huston isn't as intimidating as his X2 predecessor, Brian Cox, but does manage to play the manipulative role quite well.<br /><br />Some of the settings really don't work as well as you would think. A lot of the indoor sets look like the sets from what you would imagine to see in a cheap independent film. The special effects when used to their fullest extent work well but other times fell short (see the initial back alley fight between Logan & Gambit) and come across as if they were done at the last minute. The fight choreography between the two brothers is at times flawless and the best example of a great fighting scene is during the end of the movie which I wont reveal anything about as it's a must see.<br /><br />The film wasn't great. In fact the majority of the plot and dialogue was quite poor but my attention was brought back when the cool action would take place. Ryan Reynolds could have saved this film had his character been given a more prominent role throughout. The effects and settings work where they're supposed to but do fall flat at some points during the film. Jackman is a good choice as the Wolverine character, but he struggled slightly to hold the whole film as the character. We all learn from experience and where this film fell down may be repaired. A Sequel is apparently in the works and although we didn't see it in this instalment I do hope that we do, at some point, see Jackman put on the famous Blue & Yellow suit.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>You wanted the animal, you got the animal.<br /><br />The story starts early in 1840's Canada Northwest Territories (history tells us this section of Canada was not "Northwest Territories" until 1870 but this is a review, not a history lesson) -- with Wolverine as a child living with his brother and father.  Seems Logan is a mutant and has bone claws when he gets emotionally distraught.  When his father is killed by a gunshot, Logan gets very angry and slices the guy who did it, who turns out, in his dying breath is Logan's actual father.<br /><br />What?<br /><br />No explanation on why this is and it has nothing to do with the rest of the story, other than a plot device to have Logan and his brother (Sabertooth) escape into the forest to fend for themselves.<br /><br />A very fast run through American wars -- Civil, WWI, WWI, Vietnam -- (what happened to Korea?  Oh well) -- find Logan's brother loving the bloodlust to a point where he enjoys killing and nearly rapes a Vietnamese woman until Logan steps in.  Even so, Logan watches his brother's back.<br /><br />Somewhere in there Logan's wife is apparently killed -- more tragedy -- and when Striker steps in, the most oily, sly, deceitful military man in film history, convinces the mutant pair that they were made for better things.<br /><br />Logan gets the adamantium bones and basically escapes with his life.<br /><br />The director found it necessary to fill time, so he gives us an old farm couple that takes in Logan.  Hardly five minutes goes by when they're mercilessly gunned down by Striker's forces.  Why?  Such an unnecessary part of the story and did nothing for the plot other than what a bastard Stryker is, but we knew that.<br /><br />And a CGI version of Patrick Stewart was very, very disappointing!<br /><br />There's a post-credit scene at a bar that does nothing to liven interest in the plot at all.<br /><br />The comic book movie succeeds in filling in the missing holes in Wolverine's past but has enough Swiss cheese in the storyline to begin entering Daredevil territory (YES, I said it!).<br /><br />The brief intro with Gambit and Deadpool was entertaining but disappointingly little was done to flesh out these characters,<br /><br />Rental!<br /><br />Better:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEVZ9E">X-Men Trilogy (X-Men/ X2 - X-Men United/ X-Men - The Last Stand)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A1K3NQAO49LXL2.html">A1K3NQAO49LXL2</a><br/><p>I heard that this movie was terrible, but I couldn't believe it.

What was anybody's motive for doing anything at all? It just didn't make any sense. What's all this nonsense about having a battle on the narrow concrete ledge on the top of a nuclear power plant cooling tower? Why does Scott Summers need to show up? Horrible on all counts.

Awful.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKMQFL05Z79K.html">A3GKMQFL05Z79K</a><br/><p>I've been wanting to see a Wolverine movie that lives up to how the man is the comics. Too many times in the movies, characters are watered down to make them more appealing to those who aren't into comics so much and, because of this, comic book fans(like me) feel like we've been cheated. Thankfully, X-Men Origins: Wolverine etches that much closer to what Wolverine is in the comics and that makes this movie worthwhile in my books.<br /><br />X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells the tales of how Wolverine came to be, with the story beginning in 1845. Young James Howlett sees his father killed by their groundskeeper Thomas Logan. This trauma brings about James mutation with bones protruding from his hands. He then proceeds to kill Thomas Logan. Before he does, however, Logan tells James that he is his father. He flees with Thomas' son, Victor Creed, who is his half-brother. That's where the movie begins. The conclusion is pretty epic, I assure you, but to find out- you'll have to watch the movie.<br /><br />In my opinion,this has to be Hugh Jackman's best performance as Wolverine. In what little time he's been Wolverine, he's taken the character and encompassed what he truly is. I know many were disappointed with this movie, in general, but I felt that it was a good(if not great) movie in the X-Men series(definitely better than X-Men First Class, even though this one came out long beforehand).<br /><br />I've read a sequel is in the works to this movie, simply called:The Wolverine. I've also read that the sequel might sport an R-rating. I'd really love to see that happen so that Wolverine fans can really see their beloved character 'cut loose'. I've only seen one other movie to ever really show a Marvel character for what it was and that was Punisher: War Journal(one I also recommend). Here's hoping we see it happen.</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>The film starts in 1845 and by the time the credits is over, it is up to date. Wolverine and his brother are recruited to fight in a special mutant force. The mutants are never introduced. There is an assumption you know these characters from previous movies or comics. I would not recommend this film as an introduction to X-Men.<br /><br />The special forces are more brutal than what Wolverine wants to be. "This isn't what we signed up for, " he says as he walks out. He becomes a Canadian and lives quietly like as a lumber jack. His brother is on a rampage...and Wolverine's life becomes disrupted. He must once again fight, only this time he is stronger and is more of a killer.<br /><br />The movie ties in nicely with the other 4 X-Men movies, which should be viewed to get an overall picture, which is difficult to obtain in this film alone. The acting was sufficient. Good CG, super action and fighting. It has plot twists, so pay attention. The movie sprinkles in the right amount of humor, drama, and truisms into the dialouge to make it a fun watch.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>Wolverine is one of the more enduring characters from Marvel Comics, and it's not really that hard to see why. He's charismatic, intelligent and something of a major bad-ass. He's also now, after three appearances in the X-Men films, showing his claws in his own movie, X-Men Origins: Wolverine.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman tears up the screen as the title character, proving that he's more than capable of driving the movie by himself. He brings some real screen presence to the film, and that's good, cause if he didn't it would likely have sunk under its own weight and not been even watchable. As it is, the film is actually pretty good, though not great.<br /><br />The movie starts with young Logan in 1840's as he comes of age in the Northern Territories of Canada (though as Roger Ebert pointed out, neither such entity existed in the 1840's). He's a sickly lad made somewhat better by killing his father. He then embarks on a dramatic opening credits sequence showing him and his brother, Victor, as they fight their way through virtually every major war (on the American side, oddly. I guess Canada doesn't have enough wars for them to be interested. Also, this may be the only movie I've ever seen where large parts took place in Canada but were filmed elsewhere).<br /><br />After the credits we see Logan and his brother (now played by Liev Schreiber, who is almost as compelling a presence as Hugh Jackman), teaming up with a bunch of other mutants to... I'm not entirely clear what they were supposed to be doing, actually. They seem to end up being a private army for one Major Stryker (played by Danny Houston, who isn't nearly as interesting as Brian Cox). After some nastiness in Nigeria, Logan decides to part company with his team and goes back to Canada. He settles down there until the movie decides it's time for him to get back into action and then, as they say, hilarity ensues. Or something.<br /><br />We do get appearances by various characters from the Marvel universe, including Wolverine and Sabertooth, but also Deadpool, Silverfox, the Blob and Gambit, as well as a young Cyclops and a young... well, that would spoil a surprise.<br /><br />The plot isn't really much of much here, though it does do a good job of establishing where Wolverine came from. The action scenes are serviceable (although I have to say two immortals trying to fight each other to the death seems really, really pointless), and get the job done, though the SFX is mediocre at times (and Wolverine's metal claws look really fake compared to what he had in the X-Men films). The acting is decent by pretty much everyone (though the guy who plays Gambit has a very unconvincing accent. Really hot, though).<br /><br />The setting of the film is also somewhat confusing, since most of the movie takes place in the late 1970's, but you wouldn't know that unless the movie told you. Several of the shots, especially with crowds, look like they take place now rather than then.<br /><br />This isn't a great movie, but it is a decent one and a good enough way to pass the time. If you go in with fairly low expectations, you'll likely have a good time. At the very least, it's much, much better than X-Men 3.<br /><br />Now next let's have an Alpha Flight movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>Comic book fans are in Heaven right now. Movies are being made left and right based on comic books. Recent releases like WHITEOUT and SURROGATES are both based on comics. And while they're a few years back, the X-MEN movies were always hits. So it's no surprise that the most popular character of the comics and films would get his own solo flick.<br /><br />X-MEN ORIGINS:WOLVERINE begins in 1845 when young James Howlett kills a man for killing his father, only to discover that the man he's killed is actually his biological dad. On the run with his half-brother Victor Creed, the pair bound through history, both mutants with the ability to self heal and age slowly. Their killing abilities are utilized in all wars, but it is Victor who seems to enjoy it while James merely sticks with his brother.<br /><br />Fast forward to the Vietnam War with Victor (Liv Schreiber) and James (Hugh Jackman) facing a firing squad only to survive. In prison, they are recruited by General Stryker (Danny Huston) for a unique squad that will covertly take care of problems for the U.S. Composed of various other mutants, the team often rustles each other's feathers, but do the wet work their job requires of them. The killing begins to get to James, now known as Logan, and he quits the team.<br /><br />The scene changes to several years later and Logan is now living happily in Canada as a lumberjack with a woman he loves, Kayla (Lynn Collins). Stryker arrives to tell Logan that someone is killing the ex-members of the team and to be careful. The warning is too late and we are there to see Victor meet up with Kayla. When Logan finds her body, he tracks down Stryker to be a part of his secret project, Weapon X, in an attempt to turn Logan into an indestructible killer. When asked what his dog tags should read, he says Wolverine, a reference to a story Kayla had told him.<br /><br />The procedure nearly kills Wolverine as the scientists inject molten adamantium, the strongest metal known to man, to his skeletal system. Where he once had bones, he now has adamantium. And where skeletal claws once popped from his fists, now shining blades appear. As the process is completed, Wolverine overhears the group planning on killing him. In a rage, he leaps from the lab's tank and takes out anyone in his way, escaping to a nearby farm.<br /><br />But the welcome an elderly couple there provides is short lived as Stryker's assassins kill them both and try to get Wolverine. Once more in a rage, Wolverine takes out the team. But before Agent Zero (Daniel Henney) dies, he lets Wolverine know that Stryker has been behind it all.<br /><br />Wolverine seeks out the rest of the team to find out where Stryker has gone to ground. With the help of two he is sent to New Orleans to meet a mutant named Gambit (Taylor Kitsch), the only mutant to escape from "the island", a secret location of Stryker's where he is experimenting on mutants, like Scott Summers and Emma Frost (two main characters from the comics). Out for blood, Wolverine convinces Gambit to take him there and attempts to put an end to Stryker's experiments and Victor for killing the woman he loved.<br /><br />The film is action packed from beginning to end. The scenes and set ups bring to mind numerous images from comics past as well as characters that have become legends at Marvel comics. One is even on fast track to have his own film, Deadpool played by Ryan Reynolds. He becomes a major force in the film, though to reveal why would ruin the surprise.<br /><br />The effects are amazing here. Any and every possible effect is used for maximum advantage and it shows. Streets blow up, buildings come down a brick at a time and powers shoot from eyes and playing cards. Not to mention the adamantium claws fans are so familiar with.<br /><br />The acting is better than most would think, with Jackman now comfortable in the lead role. But Schreiber as Victor Creed is amazing. His feline like qualities from his stance to his bloodlust comes off as realistic. And Reynolds as the smart aleck Deadpool deserves his own film.<br /><br />The first time I saw this film I left unimpressed. I think perhaps I was too stoked by the hype surrounding it. This time I got to enjoy it for the sake of the film itself. I wasn't disappointed. You don't have to see the other films to enjoy this one. As a matter of fact, it actually would be better to watch this then the rest. Any way you look at it, you can expect to find plenty of action, plenty of story, and plenty of thrills that will entertain from opening to closing credits.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>Origin story of Wolverine is a decent enough time passer but if your a die-hard fan of ole' Canucklhead you'll be in for a bit of a dissapointment (I actually give the film *** 1/2 stars).<br /><br /> Hugh Jackman, as always, is great as Logan, but, the welcome surprise for me was Liev Shreiber as Victor Creed. He easily made me forget about Tyler Mane from the first "X-Men" film. Some welcome cameos from future X-Men team members are also pretty cool.<br /><br /> The action sequences are pretty standard for a film like this.<br /> Characters square off with one another giving warnings, showing off there mutie powers & then fighting with explosions or some sort of mayhem going on around them. To me, it seems part of the origin story was left out. Rose, Logan's first true love, in the comic story, was dropped for the movie version. The Weapon X sequence, that should be a major highlight of the film, felt like it was rushed. If your a Wolverine fan this should have been the best part of the film. The battle at Three Mile Island didn't have that much spark to it.<br /><br />"Wolverine" is not a bad film at all it's just that it seems by the numbers. I wanted something new & fresh to see with this character instead, I got a new paint job with the same mileage.<br /> Arrives on DVD & Blu-Ray September 2009</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>I don't think this strenuous 2009 offshoot of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEVZ9E">X-Men</a> series should be dismissed entirely, but it really doesn't contribute much to the genre the way <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C08RHA">Iron Man</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GZ6QC4">The Dark Knight</a> did last year. Both of those films set a high water mark for comic book franchises, and unfortunately director Gavin Hood (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC2FX8">Tsotsi</a>) can't seem to get his filmmaking arms around what would make Wolverine a compelling character over the course of 107 minutes. Don't blame Hugh Jackman, who puts in a valiant effort now in his fourth familiar turn in the title role. Addressing the inner demons of a conflicted character should have been within Hood's oeuvre given his previous serious-minded work, but he seems overwhelmed by the film's persistent blockbuster aspects. Fight scenes seem identical with each other, and there are lots of them here, so much so that the net result is more wearing than enthralling with the choreography and special effects looking the same from scene to scene. There are also new characters constantly introduced, each with some unique superpower of dubious distinction, so the story starts to feel like a springboard for yet more franchises.<br /><br />Given that I am not familiar with the X-Men series, I will trust that screenwriters David Benioff (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012OX7EO">The Kite Runner</a>) and Skip Woods have remained faithful to the comic book with the convoluted storyline, a true chore to follow for the uninitiated like myself. The opening sequence shows Wolverine as a sickly child sometime in the middle of the 19th century. Along with his brother Victor, he has apparently fought every major war since the Civil War, both getting killed and resuscitated for their next enlistment. The immortality aspect is probably the most problematic aspect of the story since it really doesn't give the viewer any legitimate reason to be concerned with Wolverine's ultimate fate. Consequently, the story focuses the conflict more on Wolverine's soldiering for the government and his growing identification as a mutant. This inner turmoil tears the brothers apart since Victor cannot forgive his brother for deserting the military. However, living peacefully as a poor lumberjack in Canada with his comely schoolteacher girlfriend Kayla does not prevent him from being drawn back to the cause as a member of an elite mutant unit due to the persistent efforts of Colonel Stryker.<br /><br />Even if abject alienation is still not his forte, Jackman does what he can with a rage-filled cardboard role that requires him to alternate between vindictive and sympathetic in lightning flashes. In an exasperating turn, Liev Schreiber has even less latitude as Victor (a.k.a. Sabretooth) since we never figure out why he turns so completely malevolent. Danny Huston fares better as Stryker since the character is rich in Machiavellian tendencies that are easy to root against. Lynn Collins plays an ambiguously dichotomous role similar to Eva Green's in the James Bond vehicle, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MNP2KI">Casino Royale</a>, and Ryan Reynolds has a near-cameo role as yet another comic book franchise in the making. He provides some much needed comic relief, but it's not enough to offset the constant mayhem. The explosion-driven helicopter chase and the relentless fight atop the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor are the only set pieces that linger in the memory. The rest of the movie will have greater resonance for devoted fans of the comic book.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>- Spectacular special effects and action scenes.<br /><br />- Hugh Jackman's appearance and acting is gripping. I believe he's one of the main reasons why people watched this movie.<br /><br />- As for character developments, there was a little bit but not enough to make it a meaningful movie. For example the love between Wolverine and his wife (Lynn Collins) is only briefly depicted. The relationship between Wolverine and his brother (played by Live Schreiber) shows good contrast and conflict. It gives me something to think about. It makes the movie a little deeper than it looks. Live Schreiber is convincing and looks scary as the main villain.<br /><br />- In short, this film is absolutely worth watching</p></br><a href="../users/A2BFIYZYNK54QX.html">A2BFIYZYNK54QX</a><br/><p>I saw it recently expecting one of the worst films ever made (like X-MEN: THE LAST STAND) and I was mildly surprised. I think that surprise was due to the fact that I had EXTREMELY low expectations. It's interesting to see so many characters in this film that are part of the X-Universe in some way, from Blob to Emma Frost to Deadpool, but waaaay too much of this film is either aped completely from other films (Agent Zero's gun skills are essentially cribbed from the far superior EQUILIBRIUM, and a drug inducing a death-like state of a loved one? Read any Shakespeare lately?) or the film has plot holes the size of The Milky Way. Seriously... an Adamantium bullet? THAT'S how you can explain something like the ending of this film? Ugh. The biggest mistake that director Gavin Hood and the writing team made was not really keeping with James Howlett's actual origin, which would have been a film in and of itself if they had adapted the graphic novel ORIGIN, but they decided to do a REALLY short adaptation of it: The opening five minutes. And then they went berserk with mutant mayhem. And the mayhem isn't so much the action or the story; it turned into a game: How many obscure mutants can we fit into one film?<br /><br />The other game that it turned into was how can we create a spinoff for Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool? Like that's a character that needs its own film, especially after what they did to him in this film.<br /><br />There are cool moments in the film, and moments that made me smile, and Hugh Jackman is very cool as Logan. So, again... not so bad that it made me want to punch everyone involved, like THE LAST STAND did, but not so good as to rank amongst the really-good-ness of the first film or the sheer genius of X-MEN UNITED. 3 out of 5 is a decent score if you expect NOTHING from this film other than some cool action and Jackman's wife-beater posturing.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>In Canada, in 1845, two half-brothers named Logan and Victor, go on the run after Logan kills his father.  They go on to fight in all the major wars, both being able to heal quickly and being just about indestructible.  In the 1970's, they are recruited by William Stryker (Huston) who is putting together a mysterious team.  While Victor (Schreiber) is comfortable doing the team's dirty deeds, Logan (Jackman) isn't, and breaks from the team to lead a normal life.  Eventually, Victor and Stryker come looking for Logan, so they can return him to his place in that team, but Logan won't go easily, and soon pays the price.<br /><br />With the success of the "X-Men" movies, it was only a matter of time before Wolverine got a solo movie, this time in the form of a prequel.  In "Wolverine", we get his origins, as well as a look at a number of other new mutants.  We see the bond that Wolverine and Sabertooth have, and we see a glimpse of further X-Men movies to come.  Jackman is clearly comfortable in the role he has played three times before.  He does nothing special here, but he doesn't disappoint either.  Schreiber gives depth to Victor/Sabertooth that wasn't there in the first X-Men movie.  That being said, "Wolverine" falters due to an enormous amount of other mutants and a story where the ending is pretty much a given.  It has to get to "point B" to stay in continuity with the first X-Men movie, and so there is never any real doubt as to who will live between the characters we have seen before.  X-Men fans will be pretty happy though regardless.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>Before this film even came out, I read that they were going to make a darker, more violent and adult version of Wolverine. Hugh Jackman himself even hinted at it. Well, as it turns out, Wolverine is neither of those-nor is it memorable. The plot is somewhat on the silly side, filled with a very boring romance, boring characters and a not-so-interesting backstory on Logan/Wolverine. This movie explains the reason for his turning to Stryker to essentially become 'Wolverine' and the reason is pretty ridiculous. There is just something missing from this film that has plenty of action, but still feels empty. The scene in X-men 2 with Logan getting the adamantium metal insterted is completely redone here, and not in a good way- I thought they botched this up badly. In X-Men 2, Wolverine escaped a bleeding, distraught mess. In Wolverine, it was done rather plainly and not so interesting.<br /><br />I applaud Hugh Jackman for acting as if he actually WANTS to be in this film, as the rest of the actors sort of just appear and say their lines. Jackman really puts 100% in his role and though his character isn't as described in the comics, he is still very likable. His half-brother, Victor Creed, played by Liev Schreiber, should also be commended. He is clearly having a ball with his role, though his backstory is as bland as Logan's. The rest of the characters are extremely forgettable, and that includes Deadpool and Gambit-the latter has maybe 10 min of pointless screentime. There is a silly battle at the end featuring Deadpool and Wolverine and a boring ending. After the credits, there is a little bit of extra footage as well-again, nothing to get excited about.<br /><br />Also, the special effects are, at times, noticably bad, especially in regards to Wolverine's claws. It is very random though, but I can't fathom how with all that money going into a film like this, they could disregard something so blatant.<br /><br />I actually wanted to like this film, but the more I thought about, the more I found fault with it. My husband, who used to read the X-men comics, has stated that the inaccuracies are pretty glaring and appalling. I was just hoping for a good, fun film. Sadly, I guess I'll still have to wait. To be honest, it isn't as bad as the horrific X-Men 3, but it is close...</p></br><a href="../users/A3GD9BKIUT3I89.html">A3GD9BKIUT3I89</a><br/><p>I went into this one with low expectations but walked out glad I spent the time. Entertaining, basically a good summer popcorn film.  Sure you have to suspend your disbelief at the door -- but really, any movie of this type requires that.  A better film than X-MEN 3.  True, it doesn't have Famke Janssen but there is something equally beautiful, the very alluring Lynn Collins.  If you like comic movies a good one to have.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9V37MS6QY8D.html">AE9V37MS6QY8D</a><br/><p>Just as good as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPS8">Iron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition)</a>, with all the action and origins that I expected, and wished had been, in the first X-Men movie. Although I DON'T like what they did with Deadpool. Talk about a drastic change from the comic! Still, a good comic book film. This was what I thought the first <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000078UJV">X-Men 1.5</a> movie should have been. I thought Bryan Singer's film was much too overrated and found it often boring at times; at least if paid off by the public receiving the awesome <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYELVU">X2 - X-Men United (Widescreen Edition)</a>. And I hope they go through with the rumored Deadpool prequel/sequel movie they have planned; Ryan Reynolds is awesome!<br /><br />As much as I'm not too crazy over Marvel characters (with the exception of Daredevil and the Punisher), I do find Wolverine as one of the most intriguing characters in the Marvel universe, even though he is a bit overexposed. He is interesting the same sense as Superman in that he hardly ages and can not be killed by conventional methods. How would that affect someone? While the topic for both Superman and Wolverine can be dark, it is Supes that takes it lighter than Wolverine. Supes sees death and destruction (very rarily, but sometimes, by his hand and because of him), and while every living being's death does bother him, he has the inner strength to let go of things past and look to the "big picture." Wolverine, however, sees nothing but death and destruction (often by his own hand or because of him), and it plagues him to no end, even though he pretends to not care. Supes has the convenience of understanding that his alien biology causes his remarkable powers -- it's who he is, it's how he was born. On the other hand, Logan's power (his bone claws and regenerative healing) while being from his mutant-born gene, are outweighed by his violated feelings about the adamantium fused to his skeleton as well as the memory tampering by the Weapon X program (that's where the movie differs from the comic: Logan did not volunteer for the adamantium Weapon X operation).<br /><br />They've already announced a sequel for this film, and are having some of the story take place in Japan, no doubt showcasing either Logan's 1937 run-in with Ogun, in 1945 where he finds love with a girl in Hiroshima, or post-WWII where he conceives a child with Itsu. Even though all take place before the Weapon X program, it still would be great material to see on screen.<br /><br />Look for appearances by Agent Zero, Deadpool, John Wraith, Blob, a young Cyclops, Silver Fox, Emma Frost, Gambit, and Sabretooth. Overall a good job from Marvel Studios!</p></br><a href="../users/A2SGR7LE899LGG.html">A2SGR7LE899LGG</a><br/><p>I think this is the best out of the series. it gets down and dirty with awesome sfx and action scenes.

I enjoyed it immensely. It served as a great prequel to the trilogy of X-Men movies, and had a rather engaging story and plot. I do wish a bit more could have been given to the back story, but I gotta say, the sequence with the brothers moving from war to war (Civil through Vietnam) was pretty fricking sweet. I can't help but wonder what Victor was doing all these years aside fighting in wars and what made him the way he was, but overall the setup was pretty good.<br /><br />Some people might not like how this movie was done - I wasn't a big fan of all the changes, but again, it's just a movie (and a enjoyable one at that) Personally, I wasn't much for Deadpool, even his makeup was just... garish and overdone. But it makes for a fun prequel, with quite a few familiar faces (including a young and teen-aged Scott Summers) The visuals were impressive.<br /><br />If you really want to enjoy this movie, don't compare it to the comic books so you can nitpick. Just sit back and relax, and let the story and special effects take you away. Hugh Jackman is AWESOME in this movie, he makes a rocking (and very sexy!) Wolverine.

One is the review would never end and the second is, I don't really care because to me it's a prequel to the three X-Men films; not a comic book. From what I understand, fans of the comic found it to be devastatingly far from the true origin of Wolverine.<br /><br />The film opens with two young boys: James and Victor, growing up in Canada with super powers. Certain events happen and the boys leave home. Then at I guess whatever age the actors are in real life, (Hugh Jackman as James and Liev Schreiber as Victor), they stop aging; for whatever reason, this is never explained. And don't tell me it's disclosed in the comics, because this is not a comic book. It may be a comic-book-movie, but it's a movie nonetheless. And in a movie certain things need to be revealed. A sequel or prequel shouldn't rely on its previous installment alone, to fill in loose holes. Any film should be able to stand on its own.<br /><br />We know that they have stopped aging because as the opening credits roll, we see them fighting in several wars and we end the credit sequence at well over a hundred years from where we began. I guess they were tired of being Canadian because they eventually start fighting in American wars. Maybe they had dual citizenship?<br /><br />They are both in trouble with the military until a man named Stryker (Danny Huston) asks them if they want to join a special team. They join and the team is comprised of way too many super-mutant characters to keep track of.<br /><br />Next for no reason at all, Stryker starts calling James, Logan. I understand this was Wolverine's original name but it is never exposed to us why he is suddenly called Logan. The team becomes corrupt and Logan walks away. Victor isn't pleased.<br /><br />We fast forward six years to learn that Victor is apparently now bad and is murdering off the members of the team. I've seen the film twice now and with the exception of sheer boredom, I can't tell you why he does this.<br /><br />We learn why Logan is going to be called Wolverine and then Victor kills his girlfriend. Having nothing else to live for, Logan agrees to allow Stryker to spend "half a billion dollars making him indestructible" by injecting him with a special metal. Evidently, for a reason that is again not explained to us, Wolverine is the only one that can handle this painful operation. Then they get mad at each other and Stryker tries to have him killed, just minutes later. I guess the government doesn't audit this guy's allowance.<br /><br />The problem with this being a prequel is that we already know from seeing the first X-Men that at some point Wolverine is going to have to lose his memory. This takes a lot of the suspense out of the film and you won't believe how lame the idea is that they use to justify his memory loss.<br /><br />The thing that bothered me the most in the film was the horrible CGI (Computer Graphic Imagery). I am not generally a fan of CGI anyway. His claws looked like something out of a Looney Tunes cartoon; particularly in the scene of him checking himself out in the bathroom mirror. Last time I checked, technology has improved since the first three films, so what was the problem? The satire-filled commercials with Charles Barkley sprouting Wolverine like claws looked more realistic.<br /><br />There's even a CGI shot of Wolverine driving a motorcycle by the Las Vegas sign. Did they need this shot? If they did then why didn't they just have some no-name stunt guy ride by? The camera was so far away, we wouldn't have known if it was really Jackman or not anyway.<br /><br />There was also a shot of an elderly couple driving and the entire background was CGI. Why? These were two unknown actors. Why couldn't they have shot this sequence on location with any two actors? They clearly had Jackman there, running through the fields. And the elderly couple was only driving down their driveway for crying out loud; it wasn't dangerous!<br /><br />Nearly all of the action sequences looked fake. Wolverine flying through the air and landing on a helicopter looked like something out of a videogame instead of one of the most highly anticipated summer blockbusters.<br /><br />They even used CGI for dust in the motorcycle chase scene and when Wolverine was running through the woods with the helicopter shooting at him. Why? This is one of the most basic tricks in Hollywood, used for years; you set explosives in the ground, then you detonate them and it makes the dirt fly in the air, looking like bullets hitting the ground near the character. The exception would be the final action scene; it wasn't half bad.<br /><br />One of the things in the film that I did like was Hugh Jackman's portrayal as Wolverine. He was clearly born to play this part. He takes it very seriously and does a tremendous job; as he did in the other three films. Watch him in an interview and you will see that this character could not be any farther from the real Hugh Jackman.<br /><br />I also loved Liev Schreiber as the villain. He really got into character here. He is a tremendous actor and I have had my eye on him for years. He should be able to taste an Oscar because he's due one any time.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds was great as always, but only in the film for a few minutes. And at last they put Gambit (Taylor Kitsch) in an X-Men film. I'm not sure if Kitsch was the ultimate choice for the role or not but he was descent. I would have liked to have seen more scenes with him and Wolverine together; but of course they tried to cram all of these other characters into the film who were boring. This movie did not have enough of Wolverine in it.<br /><br />I suspect the film was horribly written. The plot was weak and had too many holes. I don't know how they got these great actors to sign on for this film. Not to directly blame this on the writers, but I was so upset to see my favorite line from the trailer by Wolverine tarnished. It played great on the trailer but in the actual film they add a strong and un-needed swear word. I know Wolverine swears but the line was stronger without it.<br /><br />I obviously wasn't very impressed with the directing of the film either. I feel like the director (Gavin Hood) didn't take this project seriously. I have no idea how he landed this job. According to [...], the only major film he had ever directed was Rendition. How does one go from directing a mediocre film like Rendition, to directing a movie as huge as this? Sadly, Rendition is probably a bit better.</p></br><a href="../users/AIY4H4KWR2KWZ.html">AIY4H4KWR2KWZ</a><br/><p>Not sure non-comic fans can appreciate the stunning revelation which gave away one of comicdom's greatest mysteries: Who is Wolverine and where did he come from?<br /><br />Honestly, this was a staple argument/discussion amongst fans for almost *30 years*. And until the official published work by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785137270">Jemas/Quesada/Jenkins in 2002</a> - was a secret on par with Watergate's Deep Throat in terms of lore and provocation.<br /><br />For regular film fans - that scene is four-and-a-half minutes long. &lt;g><br /><br />Despite enormous reservations, I found myself actually enjoying this latest installment of the X-Men franchise. Infinitely better than the craptacular disaster of 'The Last Stand'. Good grief, I'll watch almost anything but that shyte pile.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman reminds me of Roger Moore. Why? Because like Moore, he found the one role he was born to play - but sadly it will always be that 'one role' for all of film eternity. Certainly Moore has done other good things, '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5N6KW">The Sea Wolves</a>' comes to mind. But there's no escaping the career defining character that he will be forever linked to - you know it without any prompting. And so goes the career of Jackman.<br /><br />Personally never found any of Jackman's performances, with the lone exception of '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LC55F2">The Prestige</a>', of any worth or value. His acting has the emotional reach and agility of a tree sloth. Don't even ask about his freakish natural smile. Ugh. But as Wolverine - he absolutely rocks. You would be hard pressed to think of anyone besides him in the role of Mr. Berserker Fury. Pitch perfect, the true embodiment of Len Wein's vision.<br /><br />I'm actually a bit surprised and amused to read some reviews which comment on the comic-level characterizations and plot. Seriously? Some people actually thought this was going to be ... what...'The Godfather' in terms of depth of character and storyline?<br /><br />A fun-filled flick filled with decent-to-spectacular special effects. And a big thumbs up for Jackman's superlative, and always reliable, performance in his career vehicle.<br /><br />One last worthy note: Kevin Durand's Blob. I'm genuinely floored to see him take on this role. Until 'Origin', I could not imagine him doing anything other than big bad stud. So this was a real stretch of his acting muscles, so to speak. A repertoire enhancement for him. Kudos.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>I love this movie wasn't sure at first but not bad watchable and I love the action. With that out of the way ladies how hot and sexy was Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds. There was a time Ryan was skinny but now wow.... But great action was always a fan off the xmen comics cartoon and now movies.</p></br><a href="../users/APBB297H3ZA5E.html">APBB297H3ZA5E</a><br/><p>1. I like most have watched the prior 3 Xmen DVDs and this is the best by far.<br /><br />2. Unlike the other films, this film is focused solely on Wolverine and thus the writing / storyline is much more in depth and sophisticated.  In many ways it's akin to Batman Begins.  A definite must see for all Xmen fans.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Over the course of the "X-Men" trilogy there has been one constant story thread that has been touched upon, yet it's never been fully explored. For those of you that have watched the series, then you most likely know exactly what I'm referring to... the origin of the most popular mutant of all, Logan/Wolverine. Finally, after three highly successful films chronicling the adventures of the X-Men team, 20th Century Fox has chosen to spin-off Wolverine into his own movie and potential franchise by providing his official origin story with "X-Men Origins: Wolverine".<br /><br />"X-Men Origins: Wolverine" presents many key events in Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) life prior to his fateful arrival at the X-Mansion in the original "X-Men" film. Beginning with his initial discovery as a youth that he possessed the ability to unsheathe claws from beneath his skin, to his complicated friendship and eventual hatred of his former best friend Victor Creed (Liev Schreiber), his time spent working for the government as part of an elite team of mutant trackers, and all of this culminating in a senses-shattering showdown that will leave no one unscathed.<br /><br />The mystery behind Wolverine's origin has been a long-standing plotline, not just in the film trilogy, but in the various comic books in which the character has appeared. In 2001, Marvel Comics began a six-issue limited series aptly titled "Origin" that would establish the official backstory for the berserker mutant once and for all. Obviously, so long as interest in the onscreen version of the character remained alive, it would only be a matter of time before his origin, or at least some semblance of it, made it to the big screen as well.<br /><br />Many times with spin-offs, the story tends to be weaker than those utilized for the main franchise; however, this film appears to be one of those very rare exceptions where the quality actually remains intact. Written by David Benioff ("Troy") and Skip Woods ("Swordfish"), with some elements loosely based upon the mini-series "Origin", the story focuses upon some of the various influences, circumstances, and powerful outside forces that shaped Logan into becoming one of the most dangerous mutants on the face of the Earth.<br /><br />The story spends ample time showcasing the extremely visceral nature of the film's two primary characters, Wolverine and Sabretooth, and how they deal with their inner beasts in drastically different ways. Along with this complicated relationship, the film delves into the almost constant, yet subtle, manipulation that eventually led to Logan's decision to participate in the excruciatingly painful Weapon X program, which bonded liquid Adamantium to his bones. It's during these moments of manipulation, mostly at the hands of William Stryker (Danny Huston), that the film's story really shines.<br /><br />Another strong aspect of the film is the sharply written, and often times witty, dialogue. The interactions between the characters felt believable and completely natural within the scenes. Some spin-offs suffer from an over-abundance of clich&eacute;s or merely recycled lines and moments from the original franchise on which they are based; however, "Wolverine" easily side-steps these issues in every respect. In the hands of less capable writers that didn't feel some responsibility to keep the quality of the franchise intact, the dialogue, and the rest of the story for that matter, could have potentially gone the way of so many other spin-offs and failed miserably, thus hurting the main franchise in the process. As a fan of the series, I am very pleased by the fact that even though this is the fourth film in the franchise, the creative minds behind the series continually try to surpass what has come before.<br /><br />For all you action fans out there do not worry. This series hasn't lost sight of one of its key elements. Throughout the film's story the action scenes never take a backseat to the drama unfolding within the characters' lives. The fights are much more violent and at times graphic in comparison to the previous three films of the "X-Men" franchise; not to mention, even more up close and personal due to fewer mutants with projectile-like abilities. The decision to make the fights even more brutal worked very well alongside the animalistic overtones of the story; although it may have resulted in some parents not wishing their children to see the film, despite the fact that they may have seen the other three in the series.<br /><br />Of course, what would a comic book movie be without the use of visual effects? Well, obviously it would be quite boring, but that almost goes without saying. For the most part, the CGI-intensive sequences were well executed; however, there were some surprising scenes in which the effects looked a bit shoddy. Oddly, enough these scenes involved the use of Wolverine's claws, which by this point should have been mastered and no longer a cause for concern. I'm not sure what caused the problem, if it was a lack of texture on the CGI claws or what, but something was definitely off about them during a couple of scenes. Please note, that these are not pivotal scenes and that the problem was not all that detrimental to the end result of the movie, it's just something that I found frustrating and thought honestly shouldn't have occurred within the film. Otherwise, like I said, the visual effects were very good, and at times numerous sequences were truly awesome to watch and easily overshadowed any of the weaker moments in this area.<br /><br />Lastly, the acting for the film, just as it was in the original three movies, remains consistently high throughout. Despite having played the role of Wolverine three times already, Hugh Jackman is still able to bring a fresh new approach to the character that is crucial to the continued success of the series. No doubt the ability for Jackman to convey such enthusiasm for the role was assisted by the fact that he was so passionate about finally getting to tell the official origin for this beloved comic book icon. Another neat aspect of the character that was explored a little further in this film than in the previous movies was Wolverine's famed "Berserker Rage" (comic book fans know what I'm talking about). Although, we don't necessarily get to see an all-out fully realized rage, we are given a much closer look at what he would be like if he succumbed to his unbridled fury, and it was obvious that Hugh enjoyed this new side to the character being explored.<br /><br />Supporting Hugh are some extremely talented actors beginning with Liev Schreiber ("The Sum of All Fears"). Liev takes a role that was relatively wordless in the original film, and was tasked with creating a character that was dramatically rich, incredibly feral, and ultimately could become the nemesis to Wolverine we saw in the first movie. Not necessarily an easy job, but Liev pulled it off perfectly. He delivered a multi-layered villain that was a prime example of what Wolverine could have become if given a couple of different choices along the way, and Liev is clearly relishing every evil moment he gets onscreen. Next is actor Danny Huston ("30 Days of Night") taking over the role of William Stryker from Brian Cox ("X2: X-Men United"). Danny played Stryker with the perfect blend of subtle manipulation and malice. At times he would be fatherly, especially towards Logan (albeit only to further his own agenda), but then he would snap and show his true colors by unveiling an obviously twisted, sadistic, and potentially unstable man who wanted nothing more than unlimited power to quell the surging mutant problem.<br /><br />Rounding out the supporting cast is actor Ryan Reynolds ("The Proposal") and singer turned actor Will.i.am ("Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"). I've become a fan of Ryan's work over the last few years, and I enjoy his unfettered sarcasm that he seems to imbue into almost every single character he portrays, but never in a way that feels unnatural or tired within in the role, mind you. In this film, Ryan isn't given all that much screen time, but what he does get he definitely makes the most of by making his character of Wade Wilson (comic book fans know him as the Merc with the Mouth, Deadpool) an enjoyable addition to the group of rogues that Stryker has assembled. Sadly, his role was intended as an introduction to the character in hopes of getting an eventual spin-off for him as well, a tactic that most likely worked given the film's success; however, I for one wish there could have been a little more of the character in this story, not to mention fewer major tweaks to the character's origin that don't line-up with the comic books. But, I digress. Last, but not least, is Will.i.am as John Wraith, a mutant teleporter. Will shows that he definitely has potential, displaying some good comedic timing in a few scenes, and a natural charisma that makes for a more interesting character than I believe he would have been if played by another actor.<br /><br />Directed by Gavin Hood ("Rendition"), "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" is an incredibly fast-paced action film that delivers on all counts. Granted there are some gripes with the movie, but overall it's a very solid addition to a terrific franchise. This is a must-see for fans of the original trilogy and a perfect jumping on point for newcomers to the series.<br /><br />"X-Men Origins: Wolverine" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief nudity.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M1NNDD95HR0R.html">A3M1NNDD95HR0R</a><br/><p>Whether you loved it or hated it, I think most people can agree that Hugh Jackman is perfect for the role of Wolverine.  His performances have satisfied the Wolverine lover in me since X-Men 1.  Many people have complained about this film, but I find little to complain about.  For me, it was entertaining throughout.  You do have to suspend disbelief a lot, but that is the nature of comic book superhero films.  They have spectacular powers, and display them often.  It is really fun to watch.  I'm glad they got to include Gambit in this movie, who wasn't present in the X-Men Trilogy.  I think he's a really cool character.<br /><br />And of course, there's Logan, A.K.A. Wolverine.  I liked that you got to see him as a boy with bone claws.  After all, it is an origin film.  Without giving away the story, I can say that if you were wondering how he goes from bone claw kid to adamantium-laced superhero, this movie covers that.<br /><br />Good special effects, lots of action, a large group of superheroes showcasing their abilities, if you are a fan of these things you'll probably like the movie, as long as you don't nitpick about the minutiae.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW.html">A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW</a><br/><p>Ok, maybe I am a kid at heart, or maybe this movie wasn't as bad as I expected, but I really enjoyed "Wolverine". I thought that the story was easy to follow, well written, and full of surprises. For example, I had no idea (because I didn't read the comics and only saw some of the cartoons and the X-Men movies) that Wolverine was Sabertooth's brother (and I am not even sure that this was in the original storyline of Wolverine). I loved that twist and others in the story. And while I wouldn't say that the movie was exactly fast moving and action packed (don't get me wrong, there are some great fight scenes) ...I thought Origins did a wonderful job setting the stage for later X-Men stories. And I now understand why Wolverine has very few memories of his life pre-metal claws. We also got to see several of the characters from later stories (Gambit, Professor X, etc.) and understand how some mutants became X-Men!<br /><br />Hugh Jackman was great as Wolverine, and I liked Sabertooth's character as well. Understanding the Wolverine/Sabertooth dynamic is key I think, to later stories or even potential storylines.<br /><br />Now a brief synopsis of the movie.....As a young boy Wolverine discovers that everything in his life is not as it seems, and finding out that he has a brother is the least of his worries. For spending years fighting beside his brother has not prepared him for a future of tracking down mutants for his boss, a military man trying to cure his son (who has mutant powers), and eliminating them because they are threats. When Wolverine decides that killing and fighting isn't necessarily fun anymore, and maybe the person they are working for isn't what he appears, he leaves the organization and settles down as a lumberjack. The rest is a story that only you can appreciate if you watch it. Understanding the motives for people's actions is not always as clear cut as you would think, in this movie. There are tales of jealousy, greed, and power woven throughout. Anyway,<br />X-Men Origins, had tons of great characters (interesting mutants with interesting powers) and a sweet love story to boot. I don't see why people are being so hard on this movie because it really wasn't that bad, or maybe it is because I was expecting a lot worse.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>X-Men Origins: Wolverine sheds light on events that took place prior to the original X-Men movie. The film takes us back to James "Jimmie" Logan's childhood where a very young Wolverine is forced to flee with his older brother following an unfortunate chain of events leading to the death of his father and stepfather. His troubles however, have only just begun...<br />Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least, however, there is a very noticeable absence of attractive women that we have become accustomed to in previous X-Men films (such as Famke Janssen, Halle Berry, and Rebecca Romijn among others).<br />X-Men Origins: Wolverine is very well written and very well presented, and thus allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over again. The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the action, and the music are all good.<br />In short, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection. KEEP'EM COMING!</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>While watching "X-Men Origins: Wolverine," I couldn't help feeling something is missing here, in this special effect-laden "prequel" to the "X-Men" franchise. It has a lot of actions, but though they are entertaining enough, none of them is really imaginative and some effects look a bit cheesy. It has a lot of characters (including young Cyclops), but none of them are really interesting with no plot or character development. But perhaps what "Wolverine" doesn't have is the soul - soul of the characters including Wolverine himself.<br /><br />What you have instead is typical cardboard characters and uninvolving romance / revenge story. The new film tells the story of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), his half-brother Victor (Liev Schreiber) and Stryker (Danny Huston), the leader of a shadowy military organization. Sadly, the conflict or complexity within the characters that made the two Bryan Singer-directed "X-Men" films something special is totally gone. Victor and Stryker are both stereotyped (psychopathic villain and military villain) and Wolverine is the hero bent on revenge. Such a waste of potential.<br /><br />But of course, it might be that the new film wants to be something different, something with lots of actions and visuals. The filmmakers (including Hugh Jackman himself as co-producer) are entitled to that. However, I don't think Gavin Hood (best known for his Oscar-winning "Tsotsi") is the best choice for that job. With poorly-edited actions and not-so-impressive effects, the thrills and suspense is half gone especially when most characters are too stupid to know the obvious results of their choice.<br /><br />What "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" really needs is a good story with more complicated characters like Magneto and Professor Charles Xavier. And veterans like Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart (the latter seen very briefly) whose acting bring the characters to life.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>Marvel comics X-Men character Wolverine gets his own movie X-Men Origins:Wolverine.The movie originally released in North America in May/2009 stars Hugh Jackman as,of course,Wolverine and a fine job he does reprising his role as the fearsome mutant.Legendary comic writer/creator Stan Lee is also back in the production department.<br />The story starts out back in the 1800s as we see two brothers in a room,one sick in bed(it appears as an on going issue)and the other at his side.A man comes in to comfort him and soon has to leave abruptly as there is a commotion downstairs.Not too long after a shot rings out and his "father"lays dead on the floor.The "sick" boy comes out to witness the scene and leaps in rage at the man who appeared to kill his father and kills him.It turns out he has just killed his real father who had come to get his son.The man on the floor was a doctor of some type who had done experiments on his brother and himself.The boys flee their "home" for good.<br />The movie progresses ahead through time as the brothers reach manhood and are seen in various wars,world and otherwise;very little aging having taken place.The last war they engage in is the Vietnam War as the Wolverine's brother Victor(Liev Schreiber)has gotten them both into hot water.After a military firing squad fails to dispatch the pair they are recruited from jail to join a black ops project,which turns out to be a mutant squad.The head of this project is one Col.Stryker(Dan Huston).Time passes and Stryker's team is in Nigeria finding out the origins to a mysterious piece of metal called adamantium.It is on this mission that Wolverine calls it quits.<br />Wolverine goes to Canada and leaves the life of a humble lumberjack.In the meantime the black ops mission he left has not stopped but actually stepped up its protocol.They fake the Wolverine's fiancee's death in order for him to become so bent on revenge that he submits to being injected with an admantium compound.He becomes experiment#10,and a successful one at that.He goes after his brother Victor but it turns out Victor is just a red herring.Col.Stryker as usual is the one pulling all the strings.In fact Stryker has been rounding up mutants the world over and depositing them on an island which we later learn turns out to be the infamous nuclear reactor facility of Three Mile Island.<br />The Wolverine makes his way there and in the resulting struggles manages to free all of the captive mutants.His brother Victor,who has been popping in and out of the plot,helps the Wolverine to defeat experiment#11;a composite not only of the Wolverine but of some of the other captive mutants held there.The captives manage to find their way out of the facilities and who should be waiting in a stealth helicopter outside,but Xavier himself(Patrick Stewart).Meantime Col.Stryker has created some admantium bullets to stop the Wolverine with.While they don't kill him the Colonel pops two into his brain which causes a terrible memory loss.The movie ends with the Wolverine on his own,confused and fleeing the authorities who arrive on the scene.<br />The movie,while not jam packed with weird and wonderful mutants showing off their wares like the previous X-Men films(which I can see would a problem with those expecting this),still has many wonderful and exciting moments throughout as the pace/plot winds its way to its inevitable conclusion.We certainly see a more human side to this character and we have much more empathy for him now that we know where he came from and why.Jackman,et al,do a wonderful job in their parts and the special effects are top notch.<br />Technically speaking the movie has been transferred well and is in its original a/r of 2:35:1.The trailer is packaged here along with a featurette on the origins of the Wolverine in the comics and movies.<br />All in all a recommended movie for all fans of the other X-Men films.The movie is fast paced,has some nice action tucked here and there and the S/FX are great.Recommended.</p></br></body></html>

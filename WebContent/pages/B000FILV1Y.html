Don't put negative words in a film's title unless you are 100% sure the film will not stink. If the film is a Failure, you are only making it easier for movie reviewers to expose what a Dog your Bad film is.<br /><br />Failure To...<br /><br />Come Up With An Interesting Story...<br /><br />Trip (Matthew McConaughey, the remarkably similar "How To Lose A Guy In 10 days"), a 30 something boat salesman, still lives with his parents. No wonder. His Mom (Kathy Bates) waits on him hand and foot; while he is in the shower, she makes his bed, lays out his laundry and vacuums the floor in his room. When he comes downstairs, she serves him pancakes, scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage while his Dad (Terry Bradshaw) eats oatmeal. At a barbecue, Mom and Dad learn a couple of their friends recently got their son to move out of the house...<br /><br />Wait a minute! You mean moving out of your parents house is a choice?<br /><br />...using the services of a professional motivator, Paula (Sarah Jessica Parker). Paula takes the assignment. Along the way, Paula meets Trip's friends, Ace (Justin Bartha) and Demo (Bradley Cooper), both of whom still live with their parents, and Trip meets Paula's roommate Kit (Zooey Deschanel).<br /><br />It isn't necessary to describe any more of the story to you; you have already figured it out.<br /><br />The four year old sitting behind me was able to (loudly) predict what was going to happen next on more than one occasion.<br /><br />Failure To...<br /><br />Create Romance...<br /><br />With two such extremely attractive leads, it would be impossible to not create some sexual energy. Right? Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker. Hmmmm. I'm getting excited just thinking about them together. But director Tom Dey (the cute, fun "Shanghai Noon", the abysmal "Showtime" starring Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro) and writers Tom Astler and Matt Ember don't make the characters interesting. They get together, hug, kiss, maybe things lead further, but they talk about little and as a result, we don't learn enough about them. At one point, we learn about one single aspect of their previous relationships. These moments are meant to make their current actions acceptable, but it doesn't work. Neither character is very interesting, very nice or very attractive as a result.<br /><br />Failure To...<br /><br />Create Interesting Leads...<br /><br />Let's look at each character in a little more depth. Trip, a man at least 35, had a relationship six years ago. He was going to marry the girl, but she died and this scarred him, so he still lives at home. Because of that traumatic event, he seems to consider this license; to live with his parents, drive a Porsche, hang out with his buddies participating in extreme sports and bring a different girl home every night. But wait, if the relationship was six years ago, that means he still lived at home when he was 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29. What was his excuse then?<br /><br />...Really, it's a choice?...<br /><br />Paula also had a bad experience some years ago, but the details are vague. Now, she is a Professional Motivator, which is apparently a new way of labeling the world's oldest profession. Basically, because of this bad relationship, she takes money for dating men. Her pretense is this helps them get out of the nest. She tries to convince herself this is a good thing for these men. See, she even has a heart of gold as well. As soon as they are out of the nest, she dumps them. It seems like this would create a bigger problem, but I digress.<br /><br />Failure To...<br /><br />Balance The Characters...<br /><br />"Launch" is another of those big budget `romantic comedies' in which the supporting cast is more interesting than the leads. Ace, played by Justin Bartha, is quirky and unusual, offering some surprises along the way. Kit, played by Zooey Deschanel, is an oddball obsessed with the bird outside her window. Bradley Cooper plays Demo, another of Trip's friends, who is charming in his love of life.<br /><br />Oddly, we never find out the reasons behind the nicknames "Trip" and "Demo". Ace offers a quick line explaining his. Understanding these nicknames might have added a much needed layer to their characters.<br /><br />The true standouts in the supporting cast are Trip's parents played by Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw. Bates isn't very funny, but she is believable as a mom. Moments after sharing a complaint with her husband about their son still living with them, she serves Trip a large, homemade breakfast, enabling him to stay, but at the same time we see she has conflicts about whether he should stay. The banter she and Bradshaw share makes them seem like a real married couple. Bradshaw is funnier, as his character seems a little off. Now that he is retired, he is determined to enjoy life.<br /><br />Because the supporting cast is more interesting, more colorful and funnier, the two leads seem all the more wooden, creating an unbalanced film.<br /><br />The writers have also thrown in a lot of other strange things, most of which are designed to make the story unusual, but they do little to help make the film realistic or believable; Trip's `nephew' is a little African - American boy, various animals attack people throughout, Ace's home is wired with multiple webcams, blah, blah, blah.<br /><br />Failure To...<br /><br />Create Conflict...<br /><br />The conflict in "Launch" comes far too late in the film. Up until this moment everything is about Trip and Paula, their dates, and occasional interactions with their friends. Early on, Paula outlines the details of how she will win Trip over. Sure enough, it works like clock work until... she actually begins to fall for him. Come on. Like you didn't know that would happen.<br /><br />By the time an actual conflict develops, neither of the leads is appealing or interesting, so we really don't care. From the "Meet Cute" moment to the "Make-Up Cute" moment, they aren't real people. We just don't care enough about them.<br /><br />All in all, "Launch" is a...<br /><br />Oh, come on. Even the four year old sitting behind me could figure out that last line.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>"Failure To Launch" is a lightly funny romantic comedy about Tripp (Matthew McConaughey), a man-child who's still living with his parents.  His parents (gamely played by Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw), want him out of the house, so they hire Paula (Sarah Jessica Parker), to trick him into falling for her and convince him to move out of the house.  Of course, nothing goes as planned and Paula actually starts to fall for Tripp.  Meanwhile, there's a running subplot with every geek's fantasy, Kit (the lovely Zooey Deschanel), attempting to rid her home of a pesky mockingbird and trying to stop the advances of one of Tripp's buddies.<br /><br />The story moves along at a pace much better than the average romantic comedy, and although McConaughey is perfectly cast as Tripp, I feel that Sarah Jessica Parker just didn't fit well in this film.  Perhaps it's the fact that I see her as the annoying Carrie from "Sex and the City."  There are a few moments involving wildlife that try to be humorous, but are often played up a little bit too much as if the director is trying to convince the viewer that they should laugh at what's happening.  Also, there's one scene involving a bit of bare backside that just seems to be thrown in in hopes for a cheap laugh.  It doesn't fit with the rest of the film and throw off the entire plot for a few minutes.<br /><br />Other than these few moments, this is actually a pretty funny flick.  The strongest characters here aren't the leads, but co-stars Deschanel, Justin Bartha, and Bradley Cooper.  Much like every other reviewer has stated, these actors make the entire film watchable.  From Deschanel's bizarre yet sexy moodswings to the gung-ho mentality of eternal slacker, Demo, to the innocence of programmer, Ace, it all works perfectly for some humorous sequences.  Heck, just the names, Kit, Ace, and Demo, are funny.  Bates and Bradshaw seemed to be having fun during the making of this flick, that comes through on the screen.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, McConaughey does a great job with what he's got to work with.  The only misfire here is Parker, who isn't as funny as the rest of the gang.<br /><br />Probably more deserving of three-and-a-half stars than four, check out "Failure to Launch" as a rental before putting down too much money for it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CQON0P01BITL.html">A1CQON0P01BITL</a><br/><p>to LAUGH!!!You will laugh thru the whole movie...I laughed till I cried! Cute storyline and I thought all the actors did wonderful in this. Worth watching again!!!<br /><br />Must See!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>In today's society it is difficult for young men to see why they must leave home and strike out on there own adventure. Tripp (Matthew McConaughey) is one of those young thirty-five year old sons that are part of today's society. His parents Al and Sue (Terry Bradshaw and Kathy Bates) only want what is best for him and heir a professional (Sarah Jessica Parker) to help cut the apron strings.<br /><br />Needles to say that all the things you expect to happen happens. What sets this particular movie above the standard the standard formula is the exceptional acting and the pacing is strange. And the gratuitous nude scene is more that a few flashes in the moon light.<br /><br />In this film even the "B" story and the supporting characters get plenty of center stage. Kit (Zooey Deschanel) added a splash of normalcy.<br /><br />The only downside to the movie is the annoying introductory song which is soon forgotten and mad up for with the appropriate exit songs.<br /><br />So get out the popcorn and hit the road with Tripp.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IOM0X8">Sahara [Blu-ray] ~ Matthew McConaughey</a></p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>Matthew McConaughey plays Tripp, a commitment-phobic bachelor who still lives at home with his parents and has no plans to change that situation.  His parents, played by Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw, are at their wits end when some of their friends tell them about more or less the female Hitch, who is guaranteed to have their son moved out of their house.  Enter SJP as Paula, a relationship consultant who specializes in guys who live with their parents.  She begins dating Tripp as a means to an end, but falls in love with him along the way. Of course.<br /><br />Failure to Launch is more or less just an excuse to have two successful actors star opposite each other in a romantic comedy.  The story arc is hard to follow, the dialogue is average, and the subplots are too dense to make any sense.  I love Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew McConaughey so I was able to look past most of the movie's faults, but it's really just not that good. In fact, it got to be a bit annoying to hear the signature Carrie shriek outside the Sex and the City context and to watch McConaughey play basically the same character from How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. Overall, it's your garden variety romantic comedy with nothing stellar to make it stand out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A535W556ROBQ.html">A1A535W556ROBQ</a><br/><p>I'm glad I missed this one the first time around, as it certainly isn't worth wasting your money on in DVD format or as a download.  Hard to imagine anyone wanting to "collect" this title, which I guess is why it sells for 6 bucks and some change.  I see it is $0.01 used.  McConaughey and Jessica Parker essentially spend 90+ minutes primping in front of the camera, with whatever humor provided by Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw as Tripp's parents.  The idea of a 35-year-old live-in son is plausible enough, but the easy going life he leads as he tootles around in his vintage Porsche 911 is the kind of nonsense one comes to expect in such romantic romps.  The only saving grace of this film is Zooey Deschanel, as Parker's oddball roommate.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>I am not a big Matthew McConaughey fan, but I like Sarah Jessica Parker very much and figured that there would be at least a few redeeming qualities about "Failure to Launch." I was wrong. This movie is absolutely terrible. The basic premise is that Tripp (McConaughey) is a 35-year-old guy who still lives at home, and his desperate parents hire Paula (Parker), a professional interventionist whose job is to get Tripp to move out of the house. Things don't exactly go as planned, and Paula ends up falling for Tripp, who eventually finds out what his parents and girlfriend are up too, blah blah blah.<br /><br />This film tries so hard to be funny, but it's just not. There is absolutely no chemistry between McConaughey and Parker, the story is ridiculous, and there are a bunch of weird, random things in this movie that are completely unnecessary and add nothing of value to the film (examples: Paula's exceptionally strange roommate, people constantly being attacked by wild animals, and seeing Terry Bradshaw's naked arse for about ten excruciatingly long minutes).<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and skip this movie, or you'll end up wasting almost two hours of your precious life.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>If ever a films title should persuade you to walk in the other direction, `Failure to Launch' is truly telling.  I am so tempted to give this an `F' and be done with it, but I find that there is at least one redeeming factor in this big pile of unrealistic, clich&eacute;d garbage; the stars.  Yes, no matter how ridiculous and unintelligible and utterly preposterous this lazy mess of a film really is, each and every actor involved does all they can to make it watchable.<br /><br />So, for you Zooey, Matthew, Kathy and Jessica; I give this horrible film a D.<br /><br />The film revolves around Paula, a professional motivator who is hired by Al and Sue, parents of man-child Tripp.  Tripp is approaching his middle-age years and he has yet to move out of the house; causing his parents to resort to Paula as a way to get him out the door.  Of course, as you probably could have guessed, Paula falls in love with Tripp, Tripp finds out that she is scamming him and breaks things off, everyone's life falls apart and then they make up and things are happy again.  The issue I have with the film isn't the formula, because it's become apparent that there really is no other formula available to screenwriters today.  My issue is the reckless abandon with which the screenwriters chose to formulate the formula.  It's just very mediocre, and when it tries to be original (there are far too many animals here) it winds up being so preposterous that it is almost insulting to the audience.<br /><br />Thank God Almighty for the charm and comedic timing of Zooey Deschanel and Sarah Jessica Parker.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, Matthew McConaughey does his usual schtick and looks `super hot' (according to my wife) and so bonus points for him or whatever, but really this movie is not about him.  No, if it wasn't for Parker's undeniable charm and comedic chemistry or Deschanel's flawless timing and sensual draw this movie would have been a complete waste for me.<br /><br />Kathy Bates is generally good in everything, so bonus points for that.<br /><br />In the end though, I hate to say that I cannot recommend this movie to anyone.  In fact, when anyone I know that has seen this finds out that I've seen it they roll their eyes and ask why I didn't turn it off before it started; it is that bad.  There is nothing new, nothing remotely memorable and nothing that warrants repeated viewing at all.  I love you Zooey, and you really worked your cute little buns off to make me enjoy every moment you were on screen; but even your quirky charm cannot save this disgrace from my trash bin.<br /><br />Seeing her made me realize that I NEED to get to the movies and see `(500) Days of Summer' though!</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5VLIJMDPWHI.html">A2C5VLIJMDPWHI</a><br/><p>I found this film in the $5 bin at Walmart and thought, "Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker in a movie together? How in the world could this possibly even get down to $5?" Then I watched it. "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days" is one of my favorite movies, and I adored the chemistry between McConaughey and Kate Hudson. It was like those two were meant to be together in real life, much like my other favorite movie characters (ex. Nia Long and Larenz Tate, Gabrielle Union and Idris Elba, Bill Cosby and Phylicia Rashad). However, I did not see that same chemistry between Parker and McConaughey. I thought they gave it a great shot, but I didn't believe those two would ever date. Something about the two of them just seemed off to me.<br /><br />On top of that, through the whole movie, I just couldn't picture McConaughey living at home. He seemed more suited to play Bradley Cooper's role as the wanderer. Justin Bartha should've played the lead. He could've pulled this role off. Zooey Deschanel's role was annoying and didn't really add to the script. I lost interest in her being the cranky roommate who wanted to kill a mockingbird almost instantly and didn't even think Bartha's character would give her the time of day. I liked the relationship between McConaughey's character Tripp and Tyrel Jackson Williams' character Jeffrey though. I wish somebody would've showed a picture or a scene from his last girlfriend because since we really had so little backstory, their relationship seemed like a last minute decision.<br /><br />The only two people I really enjoyed in this film were Tripp's parents, Terry Bradshaw as Al and Kathy Bates as Sue. I thought their problem with not wanting to let their kid go and not knowing how to get to know each other again as a couple--not just as parents--was a valid and interesting story. I think the bigger problem is that this film was hard for me to enjoy anyway because I think it's so pitiful to be a grown-up living in your parents' home. Turn 18, get out!<br /><br />This wasn't the movie for me, but watching Bradshaw stroll around the fishtank naked is the only reason I'm giving it more than one star. That was funny stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>I am not sure to what part of this terrible script of "Failure to Launch" Matthew McConaughey was attracted, but it is certain that he has a star power. However, that is exactly the problem of this romantic comedy, of which premise depends on the lifestyle of one thirty-something guy named Tripp, who still lives with his parents. His girlfriends, it is shown early in the film, would not like it, even shocked to know that, and leaves him eventually.<br /><br />Now I don't know you, but if you fall for a guy like Tripp, as handsome as Matthew McConaughey, who has a good job (it seems) and owns a Porsche, will you dump him simply because he lives with parents? Yes, his mother (underused Kathy Bates) cooks for him and does his laundry, but it is still sexy McConaughey. In fact, another girl Paula shows up before him, played by delectable Sarah Jessica Parker, and falls in love with him. Apparently.<br /><br />As you see, Paula is actually hired by Tripp's parents, unbeknown to Tripp himself, in order to encourage their son to leave home. However, as I said, Paula really falls in love despite the fact he still lives with his parents because after all Tripp is so nice and charming. As the film's implausible story goes on, it gradually digresses from the initial premise about Tripp's `failure to launch' and begins to rely on romantic comedy clich&eacute; and silly and unfunny gags about animals biting poor characters, Terry Bradshaw's daddy posing naked (no, not frontal) or reviving the half-dead mockingbird shot by a BB gun. It is wonderful, even miraculous, to see actors shine in this messy script. Besides Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker, Zooey Deschanel is wonderful as Kit, Paula's sulky roommate with oddball personality, whose way of delivering lines is ten times funnier than the rest of the film.<br /><br />The film's tagline goes "To leave the nest, some men just need a little push." I don't know whether or not every man and woman should leave his `nest.' Or even so, I am not really sure parents need a woman's love to lure their son to be independent. Though the star power barely makes us forget the film's implausible story and its inept concept, the film still looks like a collection of concocted ideas from the notes jotted down on writer's memo, which probably it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>Roger Ebert put this movie on his worst movies list.

Why, knock me over with a feather! McConaughey gets to prance around with an open shirt, and Sarah gets to flutter those pretty peepers.  And that about sums up FAILURE TO LAUNCH, a syrupy, sticky blech-fest (with some really bizarre, yet lame, animal attack scenes thrown in for good measure) that was plucked from two-stardom by some pretty solid performances by several supporters, including Zooey Deschanel, Justin Bartha, and Terry Bradshaw (who knows no decency).<br /><br />A "consultant" hired by McConaughey's parents (Bradshaw and Kathy Bates) to trick (by feigning a relationship) their thirtysomething, fun-loving son Tripp to move out, Parker's character suddenly finds herself harboring romantic feelings.  Wow, like we never saw that coming.  And of course the metaphorical cat gets out of the bag, the ruse is exposed, Tripp gets ticked, and everyone else plots how to get these two stubborn lovebirds back together.  Deschanel, playing Parker's quirky roommate, is so odd she's very, very good, and Bradshaw will stop at nothing to be the center of attention.  His birthday suit scene has me starting therapy next week, yet at least made FAILURE TO LAUNCH immodestly entertaining.<br />--D.

And No in that the writing, pacing of "FTL" is no where near as intelligent and strong as "TWN." is<br /><br />With that said, Parker and Mc Conaughey as Tripp and as an extension Kathy Bates as Mc Conaughey's mother and Zooey Deschanel as Parker's loopy roommate are first rate which is a good thing as comedies often rise or fall on the brilliance or lack thereof of the supporting players.<br /><br />The premise of "FTL" is risky in that Parker's character, Paula basically makes men fall in love with and bond with her so that they will move out of their parent's house. But what happens to the men involved when they realize the ruse? Or more to the point when they realize that Paula's not really in love with them?

It's a movie that constantly hovers around sit-com territory, even though somewhere in the depths of its mediocrity it presents a very real and disturbing issue - the phenomenon of thirty something males, or "boy men" who still like to live at home with their parents<br /><br />Mathew McConaughey is Trip, a commitment-phobic 35-year-old whose "failure to launch" means he's still living with his parents in their tidy suburban home, enjoying Mom's egg and pancake breakfasts whilst she contentedly does his washing and tidies his room.  Trip is a charming all round nice guy, who sells luxury yachts for a living, but he's also spoilt and somewhat sheltered and he can't keep a girlfriend because they freak out every time he brings them home to meet the parents.<br /><br />Apparently there exists a profession for women whose job it is to inveigle and seduce these adolescent male adults from the nest - yes it's really true! Sarah Jessica Parker plays Paula, one such "consultant," who fell into the profession a few years earlier when she failed to disentangle herself from a beau from his mom and dad's house. Paula's been hired by Trip's parents - a capricious Kathy Bates and a laidback Terry Bradshaw - to seduce Trip on the assumption his newborn passion will motivate him to grow up and leave home.<br /><br />No surprises here - it's boy meets girl and accidentally fall in love, boy and girl have a misunderstanding and then eventually come together again. And I'm still not sure whether Trip ever actually moved out of home - maybe he ended up buying the boat! McConaughey and Parker have a great deal of chemistry together, and Parker is always fun to watch, but they are constantly left high and dry with thanklessly predictable scenes.<br /><br />Zooey Deschanel is, as usual, a standout as Paula's sardonic, possibly manic-depressive roommate, her brand of humor is impossibly dry and she turns the character into a wonderful comic foil. Tripp's only friends, Ace (Justin Bartha) and Demo (Bradley Cooper), also are stay-at-homers and provide some welcome eye candy to the proceedings, especially up-and-coming actor Bradley Cooper.  Failure to Launch is pretty much a movie of comic stupidity and distractions, basically aiming for the lowest common denominator in entertainment.<br /><br />Along with a bunch of stupid - but admittedly cute  - pet tricks, the characters play paintball games, go sailing and then rock climbing, they eat lunch in fish restaurants and have silly, petty arguments  - there's a real sense of desperation with the writers here - anything to build a false sense of forward thrust into a story that is predictably dead on arrival.

What's new is the parents' desire for the 35-year old son Tripp(Matthew Maconaughey)to leave home and be independent. And when he does, the parents can enjoy or dread their new found freedom.<br /><br />What impresses me are the cameo appearances of a squirrel, a mocking bird, a lizard and lastly, the dolphins. The irony that those adorable sweet creatures can give one the shock in a lifetime is hillariously presented here. Zooey Deschanel as Kit is also a delightful and refreshing choice as a cool, slightly eccentric pal.

It's fairly funny and the cast works well together. I don't care all that much for Sarah Jessica Parker as a leading lady, but it doesn't work to the detriment of the film, in this case.<br /><br />Matthew McConaughey does a really good job with his role as a thirty-something man who refuses to leave his parents' home. He has it made living there, but there is the obvious drawback: women are not impressed with his situation.  Once he gets women back home, they are usually sent running. Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw are hilarious as his parents. They are definitely a bright point in the movie.

In fact, her escapade with the mockingbird made for the most entertaining scenes of the flick.  If the fat (the main plot) were to be cut away from this movie, you'd have an entertaining short film starring Zooey Deschanel that would go over way better with most audiences than this film did.  There are some good parts to this movie, but those expecting more than your basic cliched rom-com will be sorely disappointed.  Matthew McConaughey does a fair job as leading man, but all of the cast--Zooey Deschanel included--seems to be trying to do their best with a script that is, at best, a mediocre effort with a few good moments.<br /><br />THE BAD<br />Sarah Jessica Parker.  I've never seen her in another role, so I can't make a sweeping statement about her as an actress, but she was pretty awful in this role.  Other than the plot itself, the major issue I had with this movie was that I didn't buy the romance... and that's all due to Parker's performance.  McConaughey did a fine job in selling the romance, but I got the vibe with this film that Sarah Jessica Parker was just going through the motions with this role.  Another thing that was quite bad about this movie but not horrible enough to fall into the "ugly" category below was the overall plot.  The idea that parents would actually pay a woman to make their son fall in love with him (with the intent to dump him as soon as the 'job' was done) just to get the son to move out of their house is more ridiculous than any other aspect of this film. It's played for comedy, and it just doesn't work--logistically or ANY way.<br /><br />THE UGLY<br />The editing and direction is atrocious, and quite possibly some of the worst I've seen in a major motion picture.  There is absolutely no scene-to-scene continuity.  In one scene, a character could be moving their hands in one direction, and as soon as the next shot comes up, the character's hands are elsewhere, when not even an instant is supposed to have passed.  It happens many times during the course of the film and really rips the viewer out of the story. I'm not asking for great or even good direction, because this isn't that kind of a movie--but you'd think that a professional film would at least make an effort to come across as, oh I don't know, professional.<br /><br />5/10</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>I found "Failure to Launch" to be more entertaining than many romantic comedies out there.  Hey, where else would you get to see four, count-em-four separate animal attacks?  And Terry Bradshaw's hinder?  Matthew McConaghey plays himself yet again, but he does it so well.  He is the poster child for laconic and amiable.  Sarah Jessica Parker is also entertaining.  But Zooey Deschanel steals the movie as Parker's odd roommate Kit, in many ways playing the same character she did in "Elf".  None of "Failure to Launch" is particularly new material, but it is handled well.<br /><br />At under 100 minutes, "Failure to Launch" thankfully does not overstay its welcome.  Indeed, it is refreshing to watch a comedy that does not kill the audience's goodwill by dragging way past the magic 90 minute mark.<br /><br />This is not a classic comedy; you will almost certainly prefer to rent this than own it.  Odds are, you'll forget you ever saw it a couple of months later.  However, it is light, entertaining and funny, and worth a watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker star in this romantic comedy about a thirty-something who still lives at home.  McConaughey plays Tripp, a thirty-something boat salesman who still lives with his parents in Baltimore, Maryland (surprisingly, Baltimore looks a lot like some of the towns in Western California, palm trees and all).  His parents, Al & Sue (played by Terry Bradshaw and Kathy Bates) love their son, but want him out of the house and in a place of his own.  Desperate, his parents call in a specialist, Paula (played by Sarah Jessica Parker).  Paula has made a job out of pretending to fall in love with men so that they will move out on their own.  The only problem is that Tripp isn't like the typical man Paula has worked with before:  he's tall, tan, dresses well, and earns good money.  All of her other previous clients apparently were short, fat, fan-boy types who could barely hold down a part-time job.  Paula ends up falling in love with Tripp.  Tripp realizes this and tries to get her to break up with him before things get serious.  Apparently Tripp likes women but is only interested in them long enough to get what he wants.  Tripp ends up falling for Paula and the two end up in a collision course that seems to derail, but is really nothing more than a pit stop.<br /><br />I was surprised and ended up enjoying FAILURE TO LAUNCH somewhat.  Most of this was because of the supporting cast.  Terry Bradshaw and Kathy Bates make a great couple and have some really funny lines.  However, all of the other performers are completely upstaged by the performances of Zooey Deschanel as Paula's housemate, Kit, and Justin Bartha as Tripp's best friend, Ace.  Ace originally appears as a kind of slacker fan-boy, kind of like the people that Paula normally help "launch" into their own lives.  But, Ace really isn't like that.  He ends up on a date with Kit as a bribe from Paula to keep quite about secrets he has unraveled.  The two end up becoming a pair after Ace uses a Red Ryder BB gun (thanks A CHRISTMAS STORY) to shoot a mockingbird outside her bedroom window that has given her insomnia for several weeks.  Deschanel and Bartha steal every scene they are in and their love story is more romantic than that of Tripp and Paula (not to mention how much better their acting is).<br /><br />FAILURE TO LAUNCH is a movie than many women will enjoy watching.  There are a few jokes that are aimed at guys, but the people who put this film together knew that the core audience of this film is women.  Still, with that in mind, I find some of the film's messages a bit disconcerting.  I realize that perception in the U.S. has changed dramatically recently, but there was a time in the U.S. when it was common, actually it was expected, that children would remain living at their family homes until they were married.  The family was the core and both men and women remained at home to support their families until they had families of their own.  Even after marriage, many families ended up living in the same homes and neighborhoods.  That idea of life seems to be lost in postmodern suburbia super-sized America, but it's actually the norm in most other countries of the world.  The movie also seems to say that unless you're a tall, thin, tan, handsome man, you really don't have much chance of ever being involved in a relationship (Ace looks more like an average Joe, but he's still too handsome).  As for women, the message seems to be that the only guys worth being in a relationship with are men who don't exist. These messages provide a lot of laughs, but fail to launch the movie into a realm of meaning and purpose.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Trip (McConaughey) is a 35 year old that still lives with Mom (Bates) and Dad (Bradshaw).  They do everything for him, and they are his ticket out of serious relationships.  One day, Mom and Dad hire Paula (Parker), an "interventionist" who specializes in getting kids out of their parents homes.  Her plan: get Trip to fall in love with her which will make him want to break away from his parents.  Of course, things do not go smoothly and Paula finds herself falling in love.  When Trip's friends find out what she does for a living, things get even worse for Paula.<br /><br />"Failure to Launch" is a so-so movie.  Fans of the romantic comedy will probably like the film, but there is nothing special about it.  There is little chemistry between McConaughey and Parker, and the side stories are a bit too silly.  The film has an uneven feel to it, almost as if the B-story was added just to pad the running time.  There are some genuine laughs, but they are too few and far bewteen.  This is for fans of romantic comedies only.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>Tripp (the latest in a long line of lovable slackers played by Matthew McConaughey) has a great job, fun friends, and an easygoing life.  He doesn't even have to worry about the things that should bother him - like the fact that he lives with his parents.  (In our society, we can "contextualize" mobsters into family men, drug dealers into businessmen and terrorists into freedom fighters, but there's no getting around the fact that you live with your parents.)  Though they love him, Tripp's parent (Terry Bradshaw & Kathy Bates) would like nothing more than to get rid of him, so they hire Paula (Parker) to steal his heart without breaking it and then drag it out of the house.  Paula has her rules, but Tripp proves to be more than an open and shut case of "failure to launch", and soon she finds he's become her case as much as he has become hers.<br /><br />Did you ever watch a movie for the first time and manage to able to guess exactly what a character would say, or what would happen next?  "Failure" has a bunch of moments like that - mostly involving Paula's death-Goth roommate Kit (Zooey Descahnel from "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy") or Tripp's fellow man-child friends, or his father's obsession with nudity, or various acts of cruelty against (or perpetrated by) animals.  "Failure" has many of those moments, yet it's still an endearing comedy.  Never flat-out funny, "Failure" still manages to bring a smile to your face.  It's a movie that should fail - but the cast makes a game go of it, keeping things light enough to get things launched by the story's end.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JYIDH7JIG48H.html">A2JYIDH7JIG48H</a><br/><p>During the first half, it seemed Failure To Launch was just another variation of the most cliche formula in Hollywood:  A deceptive relationship in which the deceiver falls in love with her (or his) victim, but he finds out she's phony before she can tell him the truth.  Well, that is the story in a nutshell, but Zooey Deschanel rescues the movie from triteness in the first half, and enough funny, relatively original gags and plot twists bring it to a satisfying conclusion.  However, some bits are just variations from other recent films, and not recommended for the whole family - like the retired father standing around naked once he gets the house to himself.  I'll give it 4 stars because on the whole it kept me interested and amused from start to finish, and I see a lot of movies - most don't.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Trip (Matthew McConaughey) has a wonderful life.  He's handsome, loves his job, and any time he wants to be dumped, he has the perfect plan.  He just takes the girlfriend home and lets her find out he still lives with Mom and Dad (Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw).<br /><br />Of course, any intelligent man would still live with these parents.  His mom cleans his room from top to bottom while he's in the shower every morning and always makes him a gourmet breakfast, something she doesn't even do for her husband.<br /><br />His parents aren't as happy with the arrangement.  In desperation, they turn to Paula (Sarah Jessica Parker).  Paula makes her living helping "launch" guys from their parent's house to their own pad.  She has a step by step approach that helps the guy build self-esteem to carry them to their own life.  But what happens when she starts to fall for Trip?<br /><br />Odds are you can probably guess most of this movie just from my plot description.  So the job of a movie such as this is to keep the audience entertained so we forget we already know where we're going.  Here, the movie really shines.  Part of the fun is watching Paula at work.  We know what she's up to, so several of the scenes become a joke as we watch Trip fall for each "step" hook, line, and sinker.  To top this, there are several genuinely funny scenes, such as the scene that takes all the characters to play paintball.  Even when the movie gets more serious in the final third, the overall tone is lighthearted.<br /><br />Helping things along is the great cast.  Everyone is having fun, and it keeps the tone light and the audience engaged.  Special note goes to Zooey Deschanel.  She plays Paula's moody, brooding roommate and is easily the funniest character in the movie.<br /><br />No, this movie is not "great cinema."  But it never set out to be.  It is a fun romantic comedy that will keep everyone who watches it entertained.

It also spends a little time fleshing out the supporting characters and giving them funny things to do... though I could have done without Terry Bradshaw's extended nude scene (I'm not kidding).  I mean, the guy's still in good shape and actually turns out to be a pretty good comedic actor (plus, yeah, it's more of a comic nude scene and not a sex scene), but c'mon.<br /><br />A sharp picture, a handful of adequately illuminating extras, and a main feature running time that doesn't overstay its welcome (the movie is a shade over 90 minutes) make this an easy DVD to recommend, at least for a single viewing.  Romantic comedy fans, and fans of Mr. McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker, likely wouldn't regret taking the further step and owning it.<br /><br />And, oh yeah, I have to give credit where credit is due:  there's a wicked funny scene that sends up Star Wars/science fiction movie geeks that's absolutely priceless.  As someone often accused of being such a geek, I just had to laugh, raise the white flag and admit, "they got me."</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Failure to Launch is a pretty entertaining film with an above average cast.  It's downright stupid in some ways, but it knows enough to just run with the story all the way through.  I was probably most interested in seeing how a constantly amusing Terry Bradshaw did in an actual comedy - not bad at all, really (even though I saw way, way more of him than I expected or ever wanted to see).  Of course, it helps that he's working alongside a world class actress like Kathy Bates, and the two of them do have some nice chemistry together in terms of the give and take.  Matthew McConaughey plays his leading role just right, if you ask me, reinforcing the somewhat farcical nature of the comedy.  As for Sarah Jessica Parker (who seems to be morphing into Madonna, which is sort of weird), there's that old Square Pegs bond still working in her favor.  Like many, though, I thought Zooey Deschanel really stood out from the rest of the cast - but maybe that's just because I find sarcastic morbidity strangely attractive.<br /><br />There must be something in the water wherever this story takes place, as you have a whole group of thirty-something men refusing to move out of their parents' houses (that's what "failure to launch" refers to, by the way).  These aren't nerds we're talking about, either.  Just look at Tripp (McConaughey), for example; he does all right for himself, never having to struggle to find female companionship, yet he feels compelled to nip every relationship in the bud at the first sign of "the look" in the girl's eyes.  All he has to do is bring the girl home, let her find out he still lives with his parents (Terry Bradshaw and Kathy Bates), and wave goodbye as she hustles out the door.  Now his folks love their son, but they also think it's way past the time for him to leave the nest - he's 35, for Pete's sake.  They can't just throw him out, of course - but there's another option.<br /><br />Enter Paula (Parker), a professional kicker out of nests.  Tripp's parents hire her to date their son, get him to fall in love with her, and thereby compel him to move out of their house already.  It's almost too easy, as Tripp follows Paula's lead every step along the way.  But, wouldn't you just know it, business and pleasure start to meld in Paula's heart and mind, setting up a chain of events Mr. Magoo could see coming five miles away.  Obvious as the ending is, it still works surprisingly well.  The transformation of Paula's roommate Kit (Deschanel) is just as interesting as the Tripp-Paula roller coaster ride of love, as she goes from a depressed semi-lunatic haunted by a mockingbird to a rather winsome lass who finds happiness without losing the dark edge that makes her so mysterious and interesting.<br /><br />The story isn't perfect, but its weaknesses don't seem to matter all that much as you watch it play out, largely because the film is consistently funny throughout.  Upon reflection, though, you realize that some plot details really weren't developed sufficiently - the whole nephew thing being a case in point.  I also can't approve of the way a couple of animals are treated in this film, yet even the most bothersome incident ended up being the funniest scene in the entire movie.  That's sort of Failure to Launch in a nutshell.  With its formulaic story, it really should be just another average film - but the fact of the matter is that it's well above average in terms of its entertainment value.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SCD2NYTIAQTY.html">A1SCD2NYTIAQTY</a><br/><p>For starters, this is certainly not my usual choice in visual entertainment, as I am definitely not in touch with my so-called "feminine side".<br /><br />The story line was very predictable, following the formulaic designs of most romantic comedies. First, the problem, (guy won't leave home at 35 years old), followed by the attempted solution, which happens to be the professional "intervener", Paula. Thirdly, feelings develop, but the fourth element of the formula gets in the way, (in this case, the whole deal between Paula and Trip's parents gets blown wide open). This is all concluded in typical Hollywood romance style with what has to be the sappiest Hollywood romance ending I have seen.<br /><br />However, in all this predictable formula, there were some genuine funny parts, such as Trip being victimised by nature, (bitten by vegetarian lizards, attacked by a dolphin and brutally assaulted by a chipmunk, among others). There were also some good witticisms from secondary characters, such as Trips two friends and Paula's flatmate, the mockingbird-hating Kat.<br /><br />All in all, it was an ok movie for the romantic comedy buffs, with some light entertainment thrown in to keep the rest of us happy. Not the best, but it was certainly tolerable to a higher degree than some.</p></br><a href="../users/AAEP8YFERQ8FC.html">AAEP8YFERQ8FC</a><br/><p>Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew McConaughy star in the romantic comedy "Failure to Launch". Knowing the nature of the plot and seeing the low average rating here on amazon.com, I wasn't expecting to love this film, but I hoped that I'd like it a little more than I actually did.<br /><br />Matthew McConaughy plays Tripp, a 35 year old man who still lives with his parents, and is proud of it, as are his best friends. Tripp's parents, at a party full of other parents with kids still at home, hear about a woman who deals with this sort of thing (Sarah Jessica Parker). For a fee, she'll go out with the stay-at-home guy, pretend to fall in love with him, and convince him to move out of his parent's place and into hers. Tripp's parents agree to the deal, and the professional launcher gets to work. However, unlike her previous clients, Tripp's situation is a tangled one, one that ends up getting the usually professional woman all tangled up herself.<br /><br />A thirty something year old man still living with his parents isn't exactly a plot I found appealing (a bit depressing actually) but then again it could have been handled a lot worse, I thought. The plus about this plot is that I never knew (at least for the first hour or so) which way it was going to go, and how it was going to end. The supporting characters are more interesting than I would have guessed too. The trouble is, nothing that's really entertaining actually happens. There's a lot of slapstick stuff with animals (which I really didn't expect) but I didn't find it that funny. The film, towards the end, also feels like it is drawn out. It is only an hour and a half film, but it felt much longer to me. Also, towards the end, the film tries to get a little more dramatic and plays a few of the characters (Tripp, Tripp's parents) "deeper" than they are in the beginning, with issues and such. Doesn't really gel well, I don't think, and just makes things feel even more dragged out.<br /><br />There are many and varied special features on this DVD, including a making of documentary, original theatrical trailer, and an interview with Matthew McConaughy and Terry Bradshaw. It's a shame I didn't like the movie too much, otherwise I'm sure I would have found these more appealing.<br /><br />There are lots of romantic comedies to choose from, and I'd recommend you choose something other than "Failure to Launch". In terms of entertainment, it didn't really get off the ground for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>There are two major problems plaguing this movie.  The first is the same one that hurt Must Love Dogs: the two screenwriters were former TV/Sitcom writers.  There is a huge difference in the humor of sitcoms/TV and movies.  Sitcom humor is good in small dosages, the 30 minutes it usually takes to tell the story and the more popular ones are about witty repartee and conversations about things that are there only to invoke a laugh.  Sitting around, swapping witty lines for the sake of being witty is funny in sitcoms.  In movies, its stupid.  And its a waste of time.  Filler.  So, while there are some very funny scenes, the humor doesn't last the entire picture or help elevate it.<br /><br />The other problem and by the far the largest is the character of Kit and the casting of Zooey Deschanel to play her.  Zooey is an actor who has been resigned to bit parts or sidekicks.  However, in every movie I've seen her in she has stolen each and every scene she's in.  This movie is no exception.<br /><br />But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Failure to Launch has an interesting premise: a rather successful, handsome and extreme sportsman guy still lives with his parents.  His parents want him out of the house and to live his own life so they can, apparently, have a naked room among other things.  Enter Sarah Jessica Parker's Paula who has a job (er, what?) that creates a romantic situation for said guy to give him the courage and esteem to leave the family.  Of course, if you watch romantic comedies you know this will involve them falling in love, him finding out, them falling apart yadda yadda yadda.<br /><br />In that respect, this movie follows the romantic movie cliches to the "T."  The problem I've already mentioned, Zooey Deschanel, is that her character is much much much more interesting than Sarah and Matthew's.  Kit's story was just so funny, imaginative and interesting that whenever she wasn't on screen, I didn't really care for the movie.  She injects a sitcom character with so much life and energy that I actually developed a pathos for her.  Unfortunately, she's relegated to the sidekick role and doesn't have as much screen time.<br /><br />Failure to Launch isn't as bad as all the critics are saying.  Various "witty" catch-phrases were invented due to the dubious name of the film.  Unfortunately, Failure to Launch isn't terrific.  It relies too much on sitcom style humor and scenes meant for nothing but to elicit that style of laugh and not enough on the actual story and character.  And Zooey's Kit is just too good of a character to be relegated to the sidelines.  For once, I'd like to see a film about that nutty bestfriend/sidekick who has given up on finding someone who gets him or her and is so annoyed with the chirping bird outside the window to try and purchase a gun.</p></br><a href="../users/A391YPR0NFTCLK.html">A391YPR0NFTCLK</a><br/><p>"Failure to Launch" is nothing original. Almost everything in this film was recycled from other films and that really hurts the outcome if you think too much about it. But if you take it on face value you are bound to enjoy it much more. There are some very funny bits but nothing too original. The directing is alright but since Tom Dey is still in action comedy mode after "Showtime" he tends to make some of the sports sequences look like action sequences, which was a bit odd. The one scene that I ejnoyed but was shot like an action sequence was the paintball game, it was very entertaining watching Sarah Jessica Parker scream and crawling on the ground running away from big men with paintball guns. And the thing that works best is the cast. Everyone was perfectly cast. "Failure to Launch" is one of the best cast movies I have seen in a while. The best thing about this film is Zooey Deschanel. She is one of the best actresses and delivers the best dead-pan humor. Overall, "Failure to Launch" is very decent, nothing great. Some funny parts, some dumb parts but overall worthy. Its a great date movie or to take the family but kids should be over 13 due to some nudity from Terry Bradshaw, funny scene but kinda gross. Overall 7/10</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>No one in this romantic comedy vehicle rings the slightest bit true.

The formula of placing eye candy stars in roles that require little more than one walk through rehearsal before filming seems to be a trend to satisfy the public, who unfortunately keep supporting these 20-minute sitcom ideas stretched beyond the limits of elasticity into a movie length features.<br /><br />The concept is that of a fixer called in to change a characters behavior only to have the 'fix' discovered and backfire. Tripp (Matthew McConaughey) is the middle-aged live-at-home-mooching-off-the-parents (a really sad comment on a male type too popular in the media) whose parents (Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw, trying desperately to find out why they signed up for this film) want him to move out and on.  They hire professional motivator Paula (Sarah Jessica Parker in a re-run of her Sex and the City mold) to affect this change only to have Tripp discover the plot and make some changes of his own  causing......fill in the blanks.<br /><br />While the stars of the film are good, solid actors who do their best with the flimsy script to make it interesting, the main reason to watch this film is for the eye candy which, in addition to Parker and McConaughey, includes the gifted Zooey Deschanel and Bradley Cooper.<br /><br />On a hot summer night without air-conditioning this bit of fluff requires no thought and does have some moments of tongue in cheek truths that make it enjoyable in the hands of this cast.  Otherwise, the film falls into the 'must miss' category.

That doesn't mean that I wish an entire film had been made only of the costars, but only that I was less than enthused with the main story line.<br /><br />That's not a good thing.<br /><br />The premise is a flimsy one. Tripp is thirty-five, and still lives with his parents, Sue and Al, played well by Kathy Bates and a game Terry Bradshaw. Sue and Al fraternize with three other couples whose sons, preposterously, also live at home. That is, until one of those couples found Paula, a so-called professional interventionist, and paid her to charm their son and through a series of steps (none of which made much sense to me) Paula was able to get him to move out. Sue and Al fall for this crackpot gimmick, and hire Paula.<br /><br />Paula, we can tell, is doing well for herself. She lives in what looks like a large house with one roommate, and they both like to drink champagne - not just any, they drink non-vintage Bollinger. It's not the cheapest, and not the most expensive, but definitely well above the average person's "every-day champagne". (It retails for between $34.99 a bottle and $45.99.) The roommate (Kit, played beautifully by Zooey Deschanel) is obsessed with a mockingbird that won't stop singing outside of her window. This provides an interesting side-story, and definitely the biggest laughs.<br /><br />Tripp's two best friends also live with their parents, so Paula, it should seem, would be hard pressed for her plans to work with Tripp, but she doesn't seem to think so (nor do the filmmakers), so she moves forward with her multi-stepped plan. One part of her plan is to share an emotional moment, and on what seems like the third day of knowing him, she calls him, crying hysterically. She's at the vet, and claims that the dog on the table in front of them is her dog, and it's being put to sleep. Her performance is, I suppose, believable. Tripp thinks so. But here's my problem: what girl/guy would want to drag a guy/girl that they very much want to bond with into such a dramatic experience right away? Nobody wants to appear overemotional or needy, and that's exactly what Paula is risking. And that's a huge risk! But, it works. It shouldn't have, though. The Tripp we've been introduced to would have seen that as too much.<br /><br />It's all too much, really, and if not for her friend with the mockingbird, this movie wouldn't fare so well. But the mockingbird scene was funny, and the supporting cast gets good marks for being a bit more interesting than those they were supposed to support.<br /><br />So, 2? rounded up to three for the supporting cast (and the mockingbird).</p></br><a href="../users/A2N69DJM8NVYZ6.html">A2N69DJM8NVYZ6</a><br/><p>Tripp is living his life to the fullest, with his mom making him breakfast every morning, doing his laundry and cleaning his room. When Tripp get "the look" from another girlfriend, he lets them dump him by brining them to his parents' house. His parents decide to hire a professional girlfriend for Tripp who ensures them that he will move out, but instead, they fall in love. The plot of the movie is predictable, the movie is funny, and it's kind of the movie you should see with you girlfriend/boyfriend.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>This romantic comedy was made in 2006 starring Sarah Jessica Parker as "Paula" and Matthew McConaughey as "Trip" - the romantic leads...<br /><br />Paula has a unique job as an "Interventionist" - which helps "launch" young men from living with their parents after a certain age -(around 26 years old).<br />Trip loves living at home with his parents - they feed him, they take care of housekeeping, and he is comfortable.  He is 35, has a job, and enjoys all kinds of sports. hat Trip's "extra" benefit of living at home with his parents is to "use" when he wants to end a relationship.  Trip's parents want to enjoy their retirement - have fun and privacy again.  They hire Paula to "Launch Trip" out of their home.  Paula falls for Trip, but there are hurdles to overcome.<br /><br />Some of the slapstick humor by the supporting cast makes for a good laugh, but overall the plot is predictable and is a basic romantic formula.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>This film has gotten a lot of unfair criticism but Failure to Launch is a solid and quite original romantic comedy. Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker shine in their roles, but I am not sure as why they needed to flash Terry Bradshaw's butt about half a dozen times! McConaughey plays Tripp, he is 35 years old, and still lives at home with his loving parents. He traps women and then pushes them away after he takes them home and they stumble upon his folks, his parents desperately want him to leave the nest so they hire Paula (Parker) who is motivational life coach, she starts to fall for Tripp and eventually he discovers Paula is not who she claims to be. I liked this movie, it doesn't take itself too seriously, good harmless laughs. I highly recommend it, enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>Every actor in this cast, including Terry Bradshaw, a former football player, is fantastic.<br /><br />In fact, why can Terry Bradshaw, a former football player, act better than professional Hollywood writers can write? This script is a mess. Scenes are short and borderline incoherent, or so dumb as to be targeted at an audience too young to care about romance. What's the point of putting goofy scenes, like the fake bird fake CPR scene, a scene that every seven year old in the audience will wake up for, in an alleged "romantic" comedy? There's no romance here. None. Zero. Zip. How do you put two such beautiful, sexy, charismatic actors -- Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker -- in a movie, and yet have absolutely zero romance or heat or sexual chemistry in the movie? I mean, you'd really have to be trying to make a movie this erotically neutered with two such stars.<br /><br />Nothing here makes much of any sense at all. The scenes are a jumble of failed ideas quickly abandoned. The direction and editing are nil.<br /><br />A few scenes are ridiculous and childish. Matthew McConaughey is repeatedly attacked by wild animals. These scenes just never take off.<br /><br />A few scenes are painful.<br /><br />And a few scenes are just plain bizarre, as if they came from another movie.<br /><br />This is such a shame. The actors were up for it, but the script writers and director gave them nothing to work with.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>It has some funny moments, but overall I found  Failure to Launch extremely predictable with Sarah Jessica Parker acting the same as she always does. MAtthew McConaughley is watchable but is not an outstanding actor by any means.  To be fair, this is a light-hearted movie which is meant for a little fun, and in that respect works.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>It's not an awful movie. Certainly, FAILURE TO LAUNCH has its share of moments. The watchability factor is brought along nicely by the agreeable performances of Matthew McConaughey, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Zooey Deschanel. Even ex-football jock and good ol' boy Terry Bradshaw doesn't embarass himself acting-wise (his nude scenes, on the other hand - aaargh!). The plot itself is pretty ludicrous: that of a female professional interventionist being hired by the parents of a live-in 35-year-old man to have a relationship with their son, give him self-esteem, and thus motivate him to move out. Apparently, the son is suffering thru what is called the "failure to launch" syndrome.<br /><br />This movie even does something which romantic movies hardly ever do, which is delve deeper than usual into the male lead's relationship with his buddies. It seemed like half the film was spent with scenes of Tripp (Matthew McConaughey) hanging out with his two best dudes in some form of rigorous sport activity. Of course, these buddy-bonding moments didn't get too serious or emotional, but there was some sincere acting stuff there. To me, however, the real standout is Zooey Deschanel, who plays Sarah Jessica Parker's dour but hot roommate Kit. She owned every scene that she was in. Girl's got charisma.<br /><br />But there's something missing here. For example, the sequences with the various attacking animals were droll enough (and the funniest scene in the movie involved the resuscitating of a mockingbird), but they went overboard with them. That nano-second shot of a chortling post-bite lizard compromised the film's tone for me, as that scene devolved the movie from initially a romantic, lighthearted romp into just outright farcical silliness. Also, the ridiculous climax was poorly thought out and then done by the numbers. Surely, the writer could've thought of a better 15-minute ending to resolve things.<br /><br />As for the two leads, I haven't seen the vibrant S. J. Parker in years and she looks marvelous here and puts in a nice effort as Paula, the professional parents-son separator. It's also nice to see McConaughey in a light-hearted gig and he carries off the role of the stay-at-home son with easy southern charm and panache. The two leads certainly provide some good chemistry. But, maybe, just maybe, the producers should've gotten someone not as good looking, someone not "Sexiest Man Alive 2005" material. Given the true circumstances of why Tripp chooses to stay at his parents' home (divulged around three-quarters of the way thru), it was still pretty implausible for me to buy into - as well, as hard to relate with - this breezy, handsome fella with a great job seemingly needing professional intervention - especially when contrasted with another one of Paula's "work," the chubby and more believable Pat Oswald.<br /><br />I guess I'm giving this one a marginal blessing. Two and a half stars, because the cast was winsome and earnest enough. Again, I couldn't get enough of Zooey Deschanel. It's not their fault that they got torpedoed by an underwhelming story, which fizzles out at the end. FAILURE TO LAUNCH is definitely worth your time and money - as a rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Terry Bradshaw and Kathy Bates play the parents of Matthew McConaughey, a 35-year-old who still lives at home.  In an effort to get him out of the house they hire Sarah Jessica Parker, an "interventionist" who has been successful at helping other young men become independent by acting as if she is interested in them romantically.  Things get complicated when, inevitably, McConaughey and Parker become truly attracted to each other and the ruse suddenly becomes a betrayal.  The movie alternates between total cliches and a few nice moments.  The cast is good and Zooey Deschanel deserves special mention as Parker's quirky roommate.

But I have to admit that there were some funny things in this movie, definitely more than I expected.

Unable to talk directly with Tripp about it, the parents hire Paula (Sarah Jessica Parker, THE FAMILY STONE), a professional motivator who assists families in ousting adult kids from parents' homes. But troubles quickly surface as Paula discovers that Tripp doesn't fit her usual profile. He's charming, has a great job, and is excessively good-looking. Changes in Paula's normal tactics are integrated only to come apart as she finds herself falling for Tripp.<br /><br />The ridiculous script and cast really give this film the umpf! it needed for success. It's surprising how enjoyable the movie is despite its light tone.<br /><br />Kathy Bates (MISERY) stars as Tripp's mother, aiding in her son's inability to move out by cleaning up after every mess he makes, doing his laundry, and fixing him scrumptious meals. Ex-quarterback Terry Bradshaw does a shockingly great job as Tripp's father, a distant man with a penchant for nudity (his own).<br /><br />McConaughey and Parker have great chemistry together, but if there's one person who stole the show it was Paula's roommate, Kit (Zooey Deschanel, THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY), a tough-talking tomboy who's lack of sleep thanks to a Mockingbird outside her bedroom window makes for some of the more hilarious moments in the film (think avian CPR including beak-to-mouth resuscitation!)<br /><br />The other thing that makes this light comedy so enjoyable was that it wasn't a chick-flick, like most romantic comedies. This one is more of a guy-flick. We all know someone who knows someone who has an adult child (usually a guy) still living in their home, right?<br /><br />The running gags on animal attacks against McConaughey's character are laugh-out-loud fun.

It's not going to increase your intellect in any way, but it certainly is a laugh-a-minute movie.<br /><br />(Things for football fans to watch out for: 1) Terry Bradshaw takes a young boy out of the house towards the end of the film and tells him, "I'll teach you how to ice your shoulders." 2) When the young boy and McConaughey are playing a football Playstation game, pay attention to the teams).</p></br><a href="../users/A2G6GO4O7EVCPF.html">A2G6GO4O7EVCPF</a><br/><p>Matthew McConaughey (Sahara, Dazed & Confused) plays Tripp, a man who is still living with his parents played by Terry Bradshaw and Kathy Bates. His parents hire Paula, played by Sarah Jessica Parker (Sex and The City, Family Stone) to try to get Tripp out of the house. She says when a grown man doesnt want to get out of his parents house its called Failure To Launch, hence the title. The 2 hit it off real good but soon he doesnt want to be with her anymore and usually when he wants to break up with girls he brings them to his home where they see his parents so then they run away but Paula doesnt. Meanwhile, Paula's friend played by the everso adorable and funny Zooey Deschanel (Eulogy, All The Real Girls) has a mockingbird problem and wants to kill the bird. Tripp's friend Ace, played by Justin Bartha (Gigli (more like Gagli), National Treasure) tells her he has a bee bee gun which instantly woos her in. Bradley Cooper (Wedding Crashers, Tv's Alias) plays Tripp's other friend. We've seen this before...this is called How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days, Hitch, Wedding Planner, Wedding Date and so on. Plus I dont find Sarah Jessica Parker sexy and I didnt like her in this...she was better in Family Stone, the animal attack scenes were stupid except the lizard/rock climbing scene...McConaughey tripping out was funny. The supporting cast is great and so is McConaughey doing his usual stuff. Also, the most disturbing scene which should of never been in here.....Terry Bradshaw naked!! I didnt need to see that (and if I'm giving this away...good, this'll be the warning) Also starring Katheryn Winnick (Two Weeks Notice, Kiss Me Again).</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>3.5 stars. First of all, I'm a sucker for romantic comedies and let's face it Matt McConaughey has great chemistry with wallpaper and he's just flat out easy on the eyes. (I mean even the tender moment with his mother when she's trying to explain why she did what she did, Matt didn't come across as a man talking to his mother...but a man sexually aware of another woman.  I don't think he's even aware of doing it.)<br />Anyway, this story about a thirty-five year old man's inability or lack of desire to move out of his parent's house is a good premise...and that's about all.  Yeah, there are a few interesting characters assembled here but the basic storyline runs out of gas.  Sarah Jessica Parker who certainly knows how to wear anything placed on her small curvy body has been making women jealous for the better part of a decade now.  No, she not overly gorgeous, but she just has that certain something that is a good match for McConaughey's Texas charm.<br />A short movie clocking in at a little more than an hour and a half, there are times when the movie feels long.  Sarah's eccentric roommate was different, but by the time we're watching her considering purchasing a high power rifle to kill a mockingbird, I'm wondering why we're spending so much time with this character.  Obvious, the character has a drinking problem...well at least she did at the beginning of the story but then the issue was never revisited and I just shrugged my shoulders.  Then there're these strange slap stick moments with the chipmunk, the dolphin, the lizard...and I'm wonder what all this has to do with anything.  Then one of the friend's expalnation is...you're out of sync with nature.  Huh?<br />Have the screenwriters taken a tad too many sips from the spiked punch?<br />Things got a little touch and go when Sarah sleeps with Tripp with his parents downstairs...and I'm thinking...does this make her a prostitute?  Then at the whole confrontation-I'm AMAZED no one brings this up.<br /> Then at a ballpark, one of Tripp's friends make an announcement that the black kid Matt calls his nephew isn't truely his nephew...???  Of course he's not.  Tripp doesn't have any brothers or sisters and the kid...well, is black.<br />You should have seen the shocked look on Paula's face.  What?  Not his nephew,what are you talking about?  I know as a society we're preaching the whole 'love is color blind' but c'mon.  Was she truely not supposed to notice this?<br />I could live without Terry Bradshaw's nude scenes...but hey, you gotta admire the man's guts.  But this move of shocking the audience to view the naked body of the average Joe was only impressive when NYPD Blue did it a decade ago with Dennis Franz.<br />Plus, how much further up the financial ladder of mature adults are you when you live with a ROOMMATE?  Isn't that move really for your twenties?  Clearly Paula is a mid-thirties to...okay so she's forty, but isn't this a tad hypocritical?<br />And then we have the campy ending with the great bright idea of kidnapping Tripp and locking Paula into a camera rigged room and watching the couple a la reality TV while the couple patch things up.  Way...way over the top.<br />Now, I realize I sound like I didn't enjoy the movie.  I did.  At best I can say it's cute...a descent rental...but it could have been great in the hands of a better group of screenwriters.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>"Failure to Launch," despite recieving negative reviews and mixed audience reception, is actually one of the best romantic comedies of the year. Not just because of the witty script, but also because of the charm of Matthew McConaughey, Sarah Jessica Parker, Zooey Deschanel, Justin Bartha, Terry Bradshaw, and Kathy Bates. The movie does have the typical romantic comedy formula, but that's OK. McConaughey ('Sahara') plays Tripp, a 35 year old man who still lives with is parents (Bates and Bradshaw). As his parents, Al and Sue, look around they notice that it's time for Tripp to move out of the house. Problem is, they don't want to tell him. So they hire a woman named Paula (Parker, 'Sex and the City') who deals with convincing men to move out of their parent's house. Problem is, she's never had a case like this. While most of these men are overweight with no social skills; Tripp is charming, funny, and attractive. In the romantic comedy sub-plot, Tripp's friend Ace (Bartha, 'National Treasure') falls in love with Paula's roommate<br /><br />Kit (Deschanel, 'All the Real Girls'), who harbors a hatred for an annoying mockingbird that lives outside her window. One critic (Richard Roeper) complained that the movie was unrealistic, because of the presence of McConaughey. He said McConaughey was the kind of guy who moves out of his parent's house at 15 because he's dating his teacher...Technically, he's right. But that's the point of this movie. They didn't want to cast a person like Philip Seymour Hoffman in the role. They need a good looking, charismatic lead. Roger Ebert complained that you didn't really like the characters because they're all deceitful. The writers of this movie admit that the characters aren't particularly likeable, but I didn't mind them. All the actors are perfectly cast, but in my opinion it's the Deschanel-Bartha part of the movie that really makes it interesting. First of all, Zooey Deschanel is not only a very talented actress (see "All the Real Girls" or "Winter Passing") but she's also capable of being funny. In this movie, she's in top comic form. Her character, Kit, is very funny. She's quite literally the highlight of this movie. Anyway, if you don't like silly romantic comedies like "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days" or "Just Friends" you probably won't like this. Otherwise, see it.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></br></body></html>

All we see are 108 minutes of Jason Bourne running around Germany. There's only about 15 minutes of action, and it's at the end of the film. We also do not learn anything about him, except that he killed two people. Also, is it just me, or was the camerawork in this film annoying? The cameraman needs to be fired. I could not follow any scenes with even remote action. It seemed as though they were trying to fit every angle into every shot. The camerawork was so damn bad, that you couldn't follow the story, which is probably how I wound up with my conclusion that hardly anything happens. However, from what I seen (yes, I did pay attention to the film), hardly ANYTHING happened. This film has the worst cinematography I've EVER seen (and that's saying ALOT), and this film is one of the most PLOTLESS films I've ever seen.<br /><br />The first film outshines this one by a mile.<br /><br />I also relied on what the critics said when I rented this, but after viewing it, I regret doing so.<br /><br />The camera work in this movie is enough to give you motion sickness. This is a 108 minute movie based on a very short plot. The filming will leave you with a headache as the camera is constantly shaking as if you were running with the characters or riding in a car on a very bumpy road. I could not enjoy the story because the camera work was so bad that it distracted from the movie. I don't know how the movie has received such a high rating. With the camera jumping around so much it was visually distracting so much that you can not enjoy it. I have the first one on DVD but I will not buy this one.<br /><br />They should've used a SteadyCam.<br />The cinematography gives a new meaning to "Sh-Sh-Shake it like a Polaroid picture!" (HAHAHA. Okay, yeah, that was bad.)<br /><br />Okay, I know you're saying "ENOUGH ABOUT THE CAMERAWORK!".<br />Julia Stiles was great for the screen time she was given. There was only one good "thrilling" scene, which is:<br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br />When he's going to snipe the woman who is after him while talking to her on the cell phone.<br /><br />In Supremacy, Jason Bourne seemed to me to be weak, not at smart as he was in the first. It was like he had lost his edge. He wasn't spouting random information, like in Identity. He only REALLY used his lightening fast fighting skills 2 times. And once, that was with a guy who had his hands together. And it still took Jason about 4 minutes to beat the guy. For a while, the handcuffed guy was beating Jason! Had it been in Identity, Jason would've kicked his butt in 5 seconds.<br /><br />This film was a disappointment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>This is an awesome action flick that actually makes you think for a change. Matt Damon once again stars as Jason Bourne (easily his best role) and improves on the great character he portrayed in the first movie. Top notch acting work also from Brian Cox and Joan Allen, these are bad guys that were actually interesting and smart. And that car chase at the end easily eclipses the one in &quot;The Bourne Identity.&quot; This is a must see smart summer film, just judge it as a stand alone (judge the film and book seperately please). Bring on the third Bourne film soon!</p></br><a href="../users/APIW11UEPKIC2.html">APIW11UEPKIC2</a><br/><p>Other people have commented on how the editing cuts so fast in this movie.  I loved it.  You always know what is going on on everyones faces right after something is said.  It is a very frenetic style.<br /><br />Supremacy picks up where Identity left off.  Having not read the books, I can't compare it.  I can compare it to other movies at this time though and tell you that this and Bourne Identity are far superior to most.  The story is very complex and we have all types of backstabbings going on(literally).  I was taken in by the whole movie.  As a whole I can't consider it as good as Bourne Identity, but the finale has to be one of the best endings to a movie I haev ever seen.<br /><br />DVD extras include a bunch of featurettes including making of and interviews.  Karl Urban gets to further explain his character.  There is also a director's commentary.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>The Bourne Supremacy is one of those films where the cast and the plotting are strong enough to survive some extremely bad direction from Paul Greengrass. Former documentarian Greengrass might be overcompensating for what is in essence a pretty commonplace revenge story, but it seems far more likely that he's inadvertently done his best to sabotage his own movie by over-rationalizing each scene without realising that when they're all put together his mixture of shakeycam incomprehensibility (often in scenes where there is no emotional or narrative need for it), redundant shifts of focus, overediting and overly dark photography just makes him come across as an unimaginative Michael Bay wannabe hack rather than creating an illusion of reality or placing the audience in his amnesiac hero's confused shoes. Indeed, he's giving the audience even LESS information and frequently obscuring the action because he's forgotten that just because HE knows what's going on doesn't mean the audience will. On the plus side, this is much less of a problem on the small screen than the big screen, where motion sickness and whiplash were real possibilities, but it's still disappointing considering that one of the great joys of the original was Doug Liman's old-school direction - it was genuinely refreshing to see action scenes where the director was showing you the scene instead of drawing attention to himself after so many years of MTV incomprehensibility. After the problems on the first film, there was no possibility of Liman returning. It's just a shame they couldn't hire a competent director<br /><br />With such a handicap, it's surprising that it works so very well - especially since there are few narrative surprises (you can guess the villain long before a trusting sacrificial lamb gives him a crucial piece of information at the cost of his life simply by scanning out the cast list and looking for the first likely typecast suspect to jump out at you). But then the fun of the first film wasn't what it did, but how it did it, particularly the practical ways Bourne evades and eludes his pursuers: the first car chase exists in a credible milieu, constantly thwarted by traffic jams and crowds. The film even manages to find an environment where Joan Allen's eternal humorlessness actually seems appropriate, and it's a genuine surprise that the film's climax is an emotional scene that effectively damns its hero even as he tries to unburden himself of guilt. Impressive stuff despite the problems.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>Just to add my two cents, I agree with the criticism of so many regarding the over-use of the shakey handi-cam.  It was especially disconcerting in the theatre with the wildly cut chase at the end.  The DVD is somewhat more comprehensible.<br /><br />That aside, I give the film high marks for an interesting story in a tight script that deepens the Jason Bourne story a bit more and for the fast pace that held my interest throughout.  The movie didn't drag and made its points quickly and persuasively.<br /><br />Furthermore, I like the film a great deal because of Matt Damon, who is fully inhabiting the character of Jason Bourne, the superbly trained and ruthlessly efficient assassin.  Looking very fit and every inch a guy that could go on auto-pilot while he kicks your ay, Damon conveys the dual nature of a man that is troubled by his lethal past and yet is fully capable of employing his skills when necessary.<br /><br />While everyone fusses around about the next James Bond, I couldn't help but think this movie Jason Bourne is a lot closer to Ian Fleming's coldly able agent with the license to kill.<br /><br />In short, I hope we haven't seen the last of Damon as Bourne.  I liked the characters played by Karen Allen and Julia Stiles and wouldn't mind seeing them in future outings as well.<br /><br />And, finally, in the next one, whoever directs please note that the camera can jump around sometimes, just not ALL the time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>A film by Paul Greengrass<br /><br /> &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; is the sequel to the 2002 film &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;. Both films are adaptations of Robert Ludlum novels, but this adaptation may be a bit looser than the first film because it has to maintain any plot and story changes that were first introduced in the first film. A film has to be able to stand on its own, separate from the book, and since I have not read &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot;, I can only judge the film on its own merits. There are quite a few.<br /><br /> In &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) was shot and left for dead. When he awoke, he found that he could not remember anything about himself or his past. The film became his quest to find out who he is, and why people are still trying to kill him. What he discovers is that he was a former agent of the CIA, a trained killer, but that is who he was, not who he is. All of that training was imprinted so deeply in him that even though he couldn't remember who he was, he was able to call on that training when the situation required, and it was required often. By the end of the film, Bourne had made his break from the CIA and warned them to leave him alone, because even a hint of the CIA on his trail would bring the wrath of Bourne upon them.<br /><br /> The story picks up in &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; a couple of year later in Goa, India. Bourne is living with Marie (Franka Potente), the woman from the first film, on the seashore. He still can't remember much of his past life, though he has nightmares that gives him hints that there is something more, something deeper that he is missing. That something starts creeping up on him when he spots a man in the marketplace who shouldn't be there. The man is nobody that Bourne recognizes, but Bourne knows that his cover is blown and that he is in danger again. Bourne's assumption: The CIA is after him again, and this means that Bourne is going to take the fight to the people responsible.<br /><br /> What the viewer knows, and Bourne does not, is that the CIA is not after him, at least not yet. Somebody else is targeting Jason Bourne, and that same somebody else is also targeting the CIA by framing Bourne for a double murder of two CIA agents. This adds an additional layer onto the story because as both Bourne and senior CIA operative Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) are in the midst of a potentially deadly &quot;dance&quot; with each other, the viewer knows that something else is in play.<br /><br /> For those tired of how tedious the James Bond franchise has become, may I suggest the Jason Bourne franchise. The series is going in a completely different direction than James Bond, as Bourne wants nothing more than to be left alone with his fractured memories, but as an entry into the genre of the &quot;spy/espionage&quot; film, the two Bourne films are a breath of fresh air. Why are they a breath of fresh air? Because they are both exciting and interesting movies.<br /><br /> Not having to spend as much time setting up the story as its predecessor did, &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; is an extremely fast paced, exciting movie. This time Jason Bourne is the one driving the story as he tries to get to Pamela Landy and the CIA and stop them from going after him. This time it is self-preservation that drives Bourne, rather than self-discovery. Bourne is pushed back into a life that he wants no part of, but he is prepared to do what it takes to be able to put the life behind him.<br /><br /> Matt Damon embodies Jason Bourne seamlessly. There is a palpable sense that Bourne is a dangerous man even when is sitting silently, or walking down a street. Damon would not have been an actor that I would have expecting this transformation from, but he works as an action star as well as a spy capable of such violence. This leads me into the style of the action itself. The camera work/editing is jolting and jerky. When Bourne fights, I got a sense of the speed and intensity of the fight, but I also felt jerked around too much by the camera. The cuts were too quick, and too glaring for my taste, but were still effective for the movie. It just made some sequences harder to follow than may have been necessary.<br /><br /> There is a frantic pace to the film that is appropriate to the type of story that is being told, but the best scenes are those were the characters are standing around talking. Scenes with the CIA agents, or between Bourne and the CIA, are what the story is built on and do not slow down the pace or the tension in &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot;. There is still one more Jason Bourne novel written by Robert Ludlum, so perhaps we can expect one more movie (two more if we count the Bourne novel written by Eric Van Lustbader). I can only hope, because the Bourne franchise has proven to be an intelligent, exciting action franchise. That's a good thing.<br /><br /> -Joe Sherry</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Jason Bourne is back and being chased once again. He has been framed for the murder of 2 CIA agents. They worked for Joan Allen's character so she's doing everything in her power to find and catch Bourne. While a deadly assasin has been hired secretly to take out Bourne as well.<br /><br />  The result is a gripping thriller with intense chases and great action. Matt Damon is at his best once again as Bourne as well. This is no doubt his best role because he's just awesome in it and no one else can do it. He's unpredictable too, you never know what he'll do next. I loved the first one and surprised that I actually liked this one more. I can't wait for a 3rd one.</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>I absolutely loved the Bourne Identity and eagerly anticipated this film.  I read several reviews of this film and they all said the same things, the camera shots and the editing of the action scenes were disjointed and shaky and hard to follow.<br /><br />I believe it was Roger Ebert who said the action scenes were something you just had to wait through to get back to the good part of the movie.  Because most of the movie is great.  Damon is exciting as the mysterious Bourne who outmaneuvers the CIA that is trying to kill him because they believed he killed some of their agents.<br /><br />I enjoyed the spy aspects of this thriller as Bourne tries to find the traitor in the CIA that betrayed him.  But, this film has really few twists and turns and everything turns out to be straight forward.  I don't know how Damon knew who the CIA bad guy was, but he just shows up in his hotel room.  The Russian bad guys seem to be an afterthought, yet the final chase scene is with a Russia hitman.<br /><br />After that chase scene I settled back in to enjoy the rest of the movie, when with a sad shock I realized the movie was probably almost over and I had just witnessed the climax.<br /><br />The biggest dissappointment between the two films is the action scenes.  Bourne Identity thrilled with suspenseful scenes relevant to the plot that stood out because of their lack of computer generated effects.  Bourne 2 action scenes are choppy and disjointed and confusing, and that makes all the difference in the world.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM.html">A2VP7JOT3K7PFM</a><br/><p>XXXXX<br /><br />This movie is loosely based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Robert Ludlum (1927 to 2001).  The plot also incorporates aspects of the Bourne novel "The Bourne Legacy" (2004) written by Eric Van Lustbader (born: 1946).<br /><br />It is a sequel to 2002's "The Bourne Identity" (as is 2007's "The Bourne Ultimatum").<br /><br />This movie continues the story of Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), an amnesiac and former CIA assassin, and his attempt to learn more of his past.  This time the CIA what's to bring him in.  Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), a CIA Deputy Director and Task Force Chief who is pursuing Bourne says this more forcefully:<br /><br />"We're going to find this son of a b**ch and take him down.  I'm not having Jason Bourne destroy any more of this agency."<br /><br />Awesome fight scenes and breath-taking car chase scenes are two major highlights of this movie making it a state-of-the-art espionage thriller.  This movie is more dialogue driven compared to the first one making it for me, actually better than the first movie.<br /><br />Matt Damon as Jason Bourne effectively carries the entire movie.  Kudos should also go to Joan Allen as Director Pamela Landy for her intriguing performance.  I found the background music to be quite exhilarating.<br /><br />The various action scenes employ shaky camera work making them sometimes difficult to follow.  Some people may be put off by this but I found that this technique gave the movie a gritty, realistic, and edgy feel.<br /><br />Total box office for this movie was about two hundred and eighty-eight million, surpassing that brought in by "The Bourne Identity" (about two hundred and fourteen million).<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2004) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  There are many extras including an alternate ending.<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie effectively continues the plight of a new action hero named Jason Bourne!!!<br /><br />(2004; 1 hr 40 min (excluding end credits), wide screen;  24 scenes)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX</p></br><a href="../users/A1TMAVN4CEM8U8.html">A1TMAVN4CEM8U8</a><br/><p>The Bourne Supremacy<br /><br />The Borne Supremacy takes over where the Bourne Identity left off.  Jason Borne played by Matt Damon is still searching for his true identity and why someone is out to kill him.  One thing leads to another and Jason finds himself in Berlin.  A truly good action adventure.  I wonder if it was an accident that Robert Ludlum chose a name with the same initials as Fleming's James Bond?<br />Highly recommended for Ludlum fans and for fans of high adventure.<br /><br />Gunner  October,  2007</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>Crisply directed by Paul Greengrass and starring Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, this film offers almost constant high-speed action. As in The Bourne Identity, the young protagonist suffers from amnesia. His nightmares, hallucinations, and mini-epiphanies have yet to reveal all that he wants to know about himself and especially his past. He does know, however, that he was once involved as a highly-skilled assassin in a "black ops" project (code name Treadstone) sponsored by the C.I.A. As this sequel begins, Bourne and companion Maria Kreutz (Franka Potente) are happily settled in a seaside village in India, presumably out of harm's way. And then....<br /><br />Tony Gilroy's screenplay is based on the second of three novels written by Robert Ludlum which comprise "The Bourne Trilogy." The acting by members of the supporting cast (notably Joan Allen and Brian Cox) is consistently first-rate. Credit Oliver Wood and Dominic Watkins with the cinematography and production design which recreate violent, often deadly encounters in various locations through which Bourne flees or pursues his adversaries. He eventually establishes his "supremacy" but at a substantial cost as the film ends. I now await the adaptation of The Bourne Ultimatum, hopeful that it sustains the same high level of quality in terms of storytelling, acting, and production values. That said, I agree with others who have noted the lack of variety in the pace of plot in The Bourne Supremacy, and, the need for character development in greater depth. On balance, however, I think this is a highly entertaining film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>It would be too harsh to say that "The Bourne Supremacy" is a bad movie, but compared to the relatively straightforward plot of the first film, this was at times difficult to follow, with some explanations only showing up in the deleted scenes.<br /><br />The basics are good: Bourne is living in India, still on the run (he thinks) from Treadstone. Then a CIA operation goes bad, agents are killed, and Bourne's fingerprint is left behind ... in Berlin. At the same time, his girlfriend is shot in a bullet meant for him, which brings him roaring back to the West to settle matters once and for all, unaware that he's been framed as a traitor who kills CIA agents.<br /><br />So far, so good. Throw in a ripped-from-today's-headlines Russian oil magnate and you'd think we'd be in good company, but neither Matt Damon nor Joan Allen (in a stellar performance) can save this. Things get confused to the point where one suspects the director wasn't really sure what was going on. Some loose ends are wrapped up, there's a lot of really good action and other set pieces, but the whole does not add up to the sum of its parts.<br /><br />I have high hopes that the third part of this trilogy will return it to form. In the meantime, this is a rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>From beginning to end, this fast-paced movie will keep the viewer riveted to this sequel to "The Bourne Identity".  Jason Bourne is still an amnesiac, but as the movie progresses he remembers more details of his previous life.  It's sometimes difficult to tell the good guys from the bad guys, because someone is framing Bourne and has sicced his old agency on him.  Everyone is after him but Bourne manages to avoid bullets, stakeouts, booby traps and whatever else the intelligence community can throw at him.  Matt Damon does a creditable job in the lead role and this movie is good for an evening's entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A18M68DE1Y6W51.html">A18M68DE1Y6W51</a><br/><p>This is a fantastic thriller, albeit a tad heavy on the car chases, but not so much that it takes away from the utter enjoyment of seeing Matt Damon reprise his role as Jason Bourne, CIA assassin-turned amnesia victim with a conscience.<br /><br />As the movie opens, Bourne and his girlfriend are living an idyllic existence off the radar on the coastline of India (beautiful photography, by the way). But Bourne has a sixth sense that he is being watched--despite his girlfriend's annoyance. And he is right. Somebody in Germany has committed a major political crime and managed somehow to leave Bourne's fingerprints at the scene. Bourne is being stalked by just about everybody, from the CIA to the FBI to the bad guys on the other side.<br /><br />As the tension builds, Damon performs brilliantly as a guy who just wants to be left alone--but whose survival skills, finely honed in another lifetime, come to the fore, complete with murder and mayhem.<br /><br />I hope Damon continues with this series. This entry was finely acted, beautifully photographed and edited, and just pure escapist fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: Today it's hard to find a movie that will actually thrill you without special effects or an absurd unreal plot. The Bourne Franchise does just that. This espionage thriller is based on the second of Robert Ludlum's trilogy of books. With one more left to go its getting down to the wire. I strongly recommend that you watch the first movie before seeing this one, even if you've already seen it. The plot of this movie is ongoing and in order to have the full benefit it would be wise to refresh yourself with The Bourne Identity. Jason Bourne has started over with young woman he met in the first movie, now in India, but when someone frames him for murder the government is back on his tail. He is now thrown back into the cat and mouse game that he once knew, but knowing this movie, the cat and mouse roles change constantly. New director, Paul Greengrass, brings a new realism to the franchise. Previous director, Doug Liman, had a more formal take to the story. In this movie the camera is constantly moving back and forth to give the audience that gritty realism that fits. The first movie was a lot calmer as well with the plot. This continuation is fast-paced and tense. The car chase in this movie was incredible. I can honestly say it was better than the Matrix Reloaded's highway chase because NO CGI's WERE USED! Movies are trying to create a new reality within the computer world and trying to make audiences believe that its really happening. Why not just take the extra effort and coreograph a real car chase that will have the audience on edge instead of crashing two CGI trucks head on? The climax of the chase in the tunnel was stunning. The movie overall was stunning. You will not find a modern day action thriller like this anywhere else .<br /><br /> ACTING: Matt Damon does a superb job in this role. I don't think I've seen frustration acted out as well as he does it. The other high point of this movie is Brian Cox (X2, Troy, The Ring) who plays the menacing Ward Abbott. I really like Cox as an actor because his roles seem so believable. Joan Allen (The Contender, Face/Off) makes a new role in this movie and does a decent job, but I found her performance a little forced. Almost as if she tried just a little too hard to be a top government bigot. Overall though the acting was superb<br /><br /> BOTTOM LINE: In a day where computers do everything for us, even entertain us at the movies, The Bourne Supremacy was refreshingly good. Nothing is overdone to point where you say &quot;oh, come on, yeah right&quot;. The Bourne Ultimatum is the next and final chapter in Ludlum's story and I can't wait.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>The second film in a series makes or breaks a potential franchise. If the second Bond film had done poorly there's no doubt that that would have been the end. The same for the "Star Trek" film series (featuring either the original stars or "The Next Generation"). So the industry paid close attention to "The Bourne Supremacy". Had Matt Damon metamorphosed into an action star or was the first film just a fluke? "The Bourne Supremacy" proved that Damon and the potential of this film series passed the litmus test. Taking up where the first film ended, Bourne (Matt Damon) is framed for a CIA assassination forcing him to go on the run. He and Marie (Franka Potente) must pull up stakes in the sleepy seaside town where they've begun to make a life together. Bourne retaliates against the agents he used to call friends when he was an assassin in an intricate game of cat and mouse comparable to the first film. A warning about the film if you have a weak stomach is that much of this was shot using handheld cameras and creates the impression of a wild amusement ride during the action sequences. You may want to have your motion sickness pills close at hand.<br /><br /> Avoiding the spooky look of traditional cloak and dagger films, "The Bourne Supremacy" has the more modern jittery look of films like "Die Hard". The colors weren't vibrant in the original film but fairly subdued most of the time and they are well reproduced here with a sharp, clear and clean picture full of solid blacks. There's a touch of edge enhancement during a couple of sequences but it's kept to a minimum and is, for the most part, fairly subtle. The booming sound of the production receives a lively transfer using the surround speakers for maximum effect. One advantage of an action-thriller is that things are always faster, louder and over dramatic and those very qualities come alive in the 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound mix.<br /><br />Like the original film (and its recent double dip DVD re-release), "The Bourne Supremacy" makes the most of the DVD format with some stunning examples in the way of extras. While the featurettes could have been combined into one larger documentary, the Special Features Producer evidently felt that the audience for this film had untreated ADHD as the longest featurette runs about 7 minutes. With nine featurettes included on the making of the film, fans will get an exhaustive glimpse behind the curtain at how the various effects were achieved for the film. Beginning with "Casting" we hear from director Greengrass about the challenges of selecting a strong personality and powerful actor to hold his or her own with actors like Brian Cox on screen. "Keeping It Real", "Blowing Things Up" and "On the Move with Jason Bourne" focus on everything from the location shooting in Moscow, the various physical effects employed on the set to create the spectacular action sequences and how the crew made it seem as if Matt Damon was doing all the driving in the riveting chase sequences. Damon also discusses some of the stunt driving training that he underwent for the sequences where he was behind the wheel. While he wasn't alone (I don't want to spoil it for you), it clearly gave him the confidence as an actor to believe he was driving the vehicle while in character.<br /><br />There's also a discussion of how some of the more complex camera moves were achieved during the shooting of the film. "The Go-Mobile Revs up the Action" discusses the device they used to achieve the look of Damon driving and allowed some of the dangerous driving stunts appear even more dangerous on film. Featuring both producer Frank Marshall and Matt Damon, this sequence breaks down how these sequences were broken up so that the most amazing shots could be done with Damon actually in the action.  "Anatomy of a Scene" breaks down the sequence near the conclusion involving a bridge chase, a jump off the bridge and landing on a barge. The final featurette has composer John Powell discussing his approach to scoring the film. A warning on all of these featurettes-don't want them until you see the movie otherwise the entire film will be spoiled for you.<br /><br />Some of the deleted scenes add character moments for Brian Cox, Joan Allen, Matt Damon and other cast members but would have slowed down the film. While they are importantly sequences (and are of the type that will probably be incorporated into a "Director's Cut" ten years down the line) for the characters, they don't add anything to the story itself and slow down the overall momentum of the film.<br /><br />A strong sequel to the first film, "The Bourne Supremacy" can stand on its own as a strong extension of the original thriller. The image quality is quite good. Keep in mind the washed out quality of the images and the slightly greenish tinge in many of the interior sequences was intended. With a nine featurettes that combined run about 46 minutes, the reality is that all nine featurettes could have easily been integrated into a single documentary on the making of the film. With scene access you would have gotten about the same results as the featurettes.  A fine film that may have you reaching for your armrest to hold on for a wild ride, "The Bourne Supremacy" will keep you on the edge of your seat.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>Matt Damon is back as the highly trained assassin Jason Bourne. He tried to retire, he really did, but when his dear Marie gets killed as a result of a breathtaking chase through the streets of an Indian town, he is back to trying to find out what he had done in the past, and for whom. He finds out.<br /><br />A neat twist is that the supervisor in charge of the project of "resolving" Jason Bourne is a woman, one of those super-bitches who walk all over everyone to prove she's at least as tough as any man. Yeah, right. However, it does make it all the easier to root for Bourne to show her up. He does, of course. The scene I liked most was when he called her to tell her his terms for coming in out of the cold. He said to send Nicki, the operative who had run things in Paris. She says, "Suppose I can't find Nicki?" "You shouldn't have any trouble," he counters from his perch on the next building, "She's standing right next to you." The way the blond bitch suddenly turns to the window, genuine shock registering on her face, is terrific. Imagine a big-time CIA boss who stands in front of open windows!<br /><br />The pace is unrelenting. Seldom is there a scene that runs in human real-time, allowing the audience to know what the heck is going on. An amazing fight scene between Bourne and another of these highly specialized killers is extended to the point where frankly, it is pretty literally unbelievable. No one could survive and keep fighting the way these two do.<br /><br />So who do each of these people work for, and what are they up to? I suppose the point is that in CIA operations, you don't always know. But it's a little too much for me. Again, one of those you are going to have to play more than once to figure out what it is all about.<br /><br />If you love amazing chases and fights, if you want your action pretty literally non-stop, then this is the movie for you. Not for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CIW2OEVAJRM2.html">A1CIW2OEVAJRM2</a><br/><p>After having reasonably enjoyed The Bourne Identity, I was looking forward to seeing how the Bourne Supremacy carries on with Jason Bourne's story.  Bourne and Marie are in hiding in India, still trying to recover lost memories of the past.  But Bourne soon becomes another CIA target, after being framed for a killing, and for his own self-preservation he needs to take an active role in uncovering the secrets of Treadstone and of his hunters in order to discover why he's being gunned down.  There's action sequences and car chases a plenty, and the graphic violence did force me to look away more than once, but then again I'm known for being squeamish.<br /><br />Overall I didn't find that this film lived up to its predecessor.  The plot wasn't as plausible, and at times the motives and actions of the various characters were somewhat confusing.  The hand-held camera work has been lauded as enhancing realism by evoking an improvisational and authentic feel, but I found the frantic and jerky movement and blurry vision excessive and hard to follow, to the point that it detracted from the flow of the narrative.  Here's a case where movie-makers have adopted a home video style and just gone a little too far overboard with the deliberate amateur feel.  But perhaps most significantly, Jason Bourne's character wasn't as sympathetic as it was in the Bourne Identity.  Even though there's a real sense of him being a victim of his circumstances and even his use of violence is mostly out of necessity rather than by personal choice, there's also a sense that he's more of a colder and more vengeful killing machine after tragically losing his lady, so it's harder to empathize with him.  It's still refreshing to see a film that doesn't go overboard with foul language and blasphemy (there were a few incidences of this, but it was minimal and even less than the first in the series), but as a follow-up this doesn't quite match the strength of the original.  - GODLY GADFLY</p></br><a href="../users/A2VJ80PM1G00QV.html">A2VJ80PM1G00QV</a><br/><p>In terms of the series of three Bourne, this does move the story forward a bit, but, in essence, it is a repetition of the Bourne Identity: lots of good action scenes, less plot meat than the little in Identity, and an entirely superficial approach to character. Nonetheless, it can be quite entertaining if you do not see it in a double feature with the first (for the repetition of action might well become boring). On the other hand, if you have not yet seen Bourne Identity, then you can expect some exciting urban chase scenes. The acting is highly stereotyped but quite suitable to the demands of the script.. films</p></br><a href="../users/A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q.html">A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed The Bourne Supremacy. Because I just now saw it, I can't really compare it to the first film, The Bourne Identity. This sequel was a fine-tuned machine.<br /><br />Matt Damon returns as Jason Bourne. He's the guy who was trained to be an assassin and then lost his memory. That was the first film.<br /><br />Supremacy picks up with Bourne and his girlfriend living in India trying to keep a low profile. Unfortunately, another hitman, played by Karl Urban (Lord of the Rings) finds them and kills the girl.<br /><br />This causes Bourne to do what any distraught hitman would do; seek revenge and answers from those who did it.<br /><br />Enter the Federal Agent who knows nothing about the first movie, Joan Allen. Who assisted by Julia Stiles and Brian Cox engaged with Bourne in a case of mistaken identity and assumptions made wrong. (seemed to be the weekend for those kind of films**see Bend it Like Beckham review**)<br /><br />The fighting scenes are great. The car crashes that were used in the first film are used again. So basically it's a similar film, but you continue to learn a bit about Bourne. Can't wait to see the next one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5VLIJMDPWHI.html">A2C5VLIJMDPWHI</a><br/><p>I'm not a big action movie buff, but every time one of the Bourne movies comes on, I stop what I'm doing to watch it. In "Bourne Identity," Jason Bourne was struggling to find out how he ended up in the water accident and in this film he wants to know just who he is. The problem is that the CIA is after him at the same time. They don't believe he really doesn't know as much as he seems to not know. But what both Bourne and the CIA do know is that regardless of whether he remembers the deal he made three years ago, his fighting and killing instincts have not left him. In "Bourne Identity," he was surprised at how much he knew about defending himself and plotting on ways to disappear. The average man just doesn't know how to safely land jumping from building to building and hopping over glass with just a T-shirt from a clothing line to protect him. But Jason Bourne (aka Dave Webb) does, and he wants to know what happened to him to make him this way. The CIA is after him and he's after the CIA. The only problem is he doesn't know the name of the person he wants to see when he reaches that person. Meanwhile two female agents don't like the way the Bourne mission is going. It's gone from legal to criminal, and agents are wondering whether these two ladies are fighting for or against him.<br /><br />Although Jason Bourne should've been dead after all the car accidents and hopping from building to building without so much as an ankle sprain, the movie was still good. Was it realistic? For someone who knows how to fight and kills for a living, certainly he's going to have more strength than your everyday guy. But there were some running scenes that were over the top. That didn't stop me from enjoying the film though. I've enjoyed all three.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>This one has everything, starting with a knockout performance from Matt Damon in what may become his signature role.

I just watched the first two films in the series for the first time last weekend after years of avoiding them. My impression? That so far, the "Bourne" films deserve all of the praise and success that they've received.<br /><br />What we have here is an intelligent, engrossing, well-written, well-acted and well-directed action film that can be enjoyed by families and mainstream audiences, but that doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence. I have to give props ... pulling that off is not easy to do.<br /><br />In the second film of the series, "The Bourne Supremacy", Jason Bourne finds that, despite the fact that he still can't recall most of it, he cannot escape his past. Although managing for two years to live in seclusion with his girlfriend, he is drawn back into the violent world he tried to escape when he is hunted down by another "Treadstone" agent, who fails to murder Bourne but kills his girlfriend. (The underwater scene where Jason watches Marie's lifeless body float away is tender and beautifully sad). Bourne is then framed by the same corrupt CIA agent (Brian Cox) who used to run the "Treadstone" program that created Bourne, and Jason is forced to prove his innocence while still trying to figure out his past.<br /><br />Matt Damon is the thinking man's action hero, and a complete departure from the stereotypically cocky, wisecracking American hero type. In action, Bourne is precise, powerful and unstoppable, but when he's not, Damon plays him with the stoic vulnerability of a man who wants desperately to escape the violent past he can barely remember. When Bourne tracks down the offspring of a politician he assassinated in his former life, the scene is heartbreakingly restrained. Bravo.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W3HLHIA9UP4D.html">A2W3HLHIA9UP4D</a><br/><p>This being the second installment of the trilogy of Bourne films, this movie is pretty much a continuation of the first film. The story takes place about 2 years after the end of the first movie, where we find Jason Bourne trying to have a life of his own, but when he subquently gets dragged back into danger, the chase is on, and Bourne is out to find his own kind of justice, and once again trying to find who he is. Of course, new characters are introduced, this time its Pam Landy (played by Joan Allen) who is trying to chase down Bourne, and new twists and turns in the story begin to unfold. Much like the first film, what makes this film the most entertaining is the pacing. There's not a lot of dull parts here, and the chase scenes are pretty good. Though there are some complaints about the shaking hand-held camera work during some these scenes, some say it makes the film more real and gritty. For me, the camera work didn't bother that much, but I could understand how some may not like it. I really don't have anything that negative to say about the film. The acting, the story, and the editing are all good. As far as being better that The Bourne Identity, well..it's close, but not quite. But if you liked the The Bourne Identity, there's really no good reason why you wouldn't enjoy this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A5X1B2HBQUR3P.html">A5X1B2HBQUR3P</a><br/><p>A fast paced zippy action film. The director shoots the movie like you are experiencing the events that Jason Bourne is experiencing. The whole movie has a real life edgy feel to it due to the fact that no steadycam was used so the camera keeps shaking and gives you this documentary real life feel to it. There are very few dolly shots in the movies, it all with handheld camera. The camera is placed in specific angles and hard to reach places like the inside of the car so that you feel a lot like being in Jason's seat. The extras feature have quite a bit on how they shot the chase scene, the fight moves and the special car rig that they built to get the shots. The car chase scene is one of the greatest chases captured on film. It's hard and fast and ends with full impact. The movie does not follow the book. Ludlum's novels Bourne - Identity, Supremacy and Ultimatum document his life as he grows old in fact in Ultimatum if I am not mistaken he is a senior citizen with kids and grand kids. The movie version takes book 1 and expands on it and uses the Bourne franchise name. I have no problem with that. The books as it were would not have worked in the medium of film. Good action flick. Watch Bourne always outsmart the CIA. Watch Bourne Ultimatum whih is an episodic continuation and end to this successful series.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>Wow! Talk about a taut, mind-numbing set of sequences full of energy, moment and action, this sequel to the original -The Bourne Identity- is that most elusive of entities, a much better, tighter, and suspenseful movie than its original. This sharply spun tale allows Matt Damon to reprise his role as Jason Bourne, the recovering amnesiac CIA spy gone AWOL, this time running for his life through a catalogue of cities from Goa, India to Berlin, and from Berlin to Moscow. And with an action coda that brings to mind the breathless pace of such action classics as Steve McQueen?s -Bullitt-, it is so quick, deft, and terrific one can literally get lost in the activity.<br /><br />  Damon is superb as Bourne, an angry, amnesiac, and absolutely murderous foe for anyone who crosses his path with deadly intent, which seems to happen with stunning regularity in this film. Given the current popular disgust and disdain for the CIA, the movie hits home by portraying its hierarchy as thugs in business suits, bent on silencing Bourne regardless of his innocence or guilt. Damon is losing some of his boy-next-door qualities, but burns up the screen with an Eastwood like set of facial expressions that underplay the emotions and make the dialogue often sparse and terse. His physical presence more than makes up for the verbal void, however. His moves are nothing short of spellbinding.<br /><br />  Luckily, the plot avoids the current morbid Hollywood preoccupation with terrorists, middle Eastern personalities, or religious overtones, and rather chooses to concentrate on more traditional East European skullduggery with undertones of big money and dirty oil deals in setting the stage for murder, mayhem, and some of the most outrageously memorable car chase scenes this side of -The French Connection-. This is an exciting movie franchise that one can rest easy about, knowing it will certainly be fleshed out entertainingly over the years by Damon and company. With superbly and smartly produced thrillers like this, why not spin the yarn as far as it will go? Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>Sequels generally tend to be a bit of a let down, but not The Bourne Supremacy. Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne, and this time around, Bourne is really angry. The CIA is after Bourne again, this time thinking that he has killed two operatives in Berlin. Bourne was actually 4,000 miles away in India at the time and living with his girlfriend Marie.<br /><br />There are lots of chase and fight scenes, all choreographed perfectly, though the camera was incredibly jolted throughout and too many closeups make it confusing during hand to hand fight scenes. I overheard several theater-goers complaining of motion sickness afterward. It didn't bother me, I liked it-- it only added to the overall tone of the film, which is one of chaos, confusion, and lots of running.<br /><br />Great perfomances by Matt Damon, Joan Allen, and Julia Stiles (who truly looked absolutely terrified when Bourne put a gun to her head). This is definitely a thrill ride, one that's fantastic to see on the big screen, unless you get queezy easily. It's not really too important to see the first film either before you see this one. It would no doubt help you get to know the character better though.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A17NVM7IAPF2NS.html">A17NVM7IAPF2NS</a><br/><p>EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT movie!  While the movie departs further from the book, the story is top-notch with the right touch of human element and motivation.<br /><br />However, the camerawork is absolutely, drop-dead painful to watch.  I hate watching a movie where I can't guess what is going on because there's a flurry of "somethings" across the screen while I'm reaching for the Dramamine.  You can almost hear a collective sigh of relief from an entire movie audience when the hyperactive cameraman stops jostling about - presumably because he's throwing up off screen.<br /><br />It's such a pity, too, because I do like the story.  It's worth watching just for that -- hopefully, the camerawork on a TV screen is not as painful an experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WP0GOTX13MG4.html">A2WP0GOTX13MG4</a><br/><p>'The Bourne Supremacy' follows the life of Jason Bourne after the events of the preceeding movie 'The Bourne Identity.'  Jason Bourne, played by Matt Damon, and his girlfriend Marie, played by Franka Potente, have moved around the world to keep away from Jason's past.  They've run to India, and the past they tried so hard to avoid has caught up with them.  Suddenly, Jason is thrown back into the life of a covert operative that he has tried so desperately to get away from....<br /><br />This movie is good but flawed.  Amongst its strengths are a strong ensemble and good acting.  Matt Damon has nailed this character.  Bourne doesn't look like a guy capable of espionage or assasination, and that is partly due to Damon's portrayal.  He pulls it off beautifully.  Brian Cox, Julia Stiles, and Joan Allen also contribute admirable performances to the movie.<br /><br />Another strength are the tactics employed by Bourne.  The character is built up to be a resourceful assasination, and this portrayal is made convincing by having Bourne do clever and resourceful things.  For instance, watch how he tracks down Joan Allen's character, or how he baits the CIA into putting their men right where he wants them.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie has its pitfalls.  First off, 'Supremacy' feels almost more like a remake of 'Identity' than it does its own film.  The amnesia subplot predominates this movie in the same exact way that it did the first.  Jason knows he did something, is not sure what, but it has covert operatives chasing him.  Sound familiar?  It should if you have seen the first film.<br /><br />Second, the timing of the plot.  The first half of the movie rolls along nicely.  The plot develops and when it is not developing, there are well placed action scenes demonstrating Jason's combat prowess and his resourcefulness.  However, after that, the second half of the movie is really just Jason marching towards the conclusion, which would be fine if it weren't for the third problem...<br /><br />The third problem is the much maligned camera work.  The action scenes in this movie were really pretty good.  At least the ones that were coherently filmed were.  It seems the the film was shot using hand held cameras that were operated by camera men running to keep up with the actors.  Frequently, the action becomes indistinguishable.  The point is, the action scenes were good enough that they didn't need this primitive filming style to make them more exciting.<br /><br />All in all its a decent film.  I liked some of the action better than in the first film.  However, the story of the first film was better.  The DVD has plenty of bonus features for the enthusiast.  I'd recommend this movie to fans of the first film, and as a rental to those that like spy thrillers and action movies.  I'll catch it again if it comes on cable, but I'm not adding it to my collection.</p></br><a href="../users/AMIGVTZZIWS6I.html">AMIGVTZZIWS6I</a><br/><p>It's never easy to see Matt Damon as the action hero, but like his previous turn as Jason Bourne Damon really shines in the role.  While these stories are not faithful adaptations of Robert Ludlum's novels they do capture the essence of the novels - the idea of this former CIA mercenary who only wants to live a normal life, but can't seem to escape the clutches of a government that wants to kill him, or use him if they can.  What the creators of these films do is re-imagine the stories in modern times using modern-age enemies to face Bourne.  Matt Damon has really wrapped himself around the essence of the character and at times has some real moments of drama that you don't normally see in action movies of this type.  Damon is also surrounded by a great supporting cast.  Brian Cox and Julia Stiles are back and do a fantastic job.  This time around we also have Joan Allen as an embattled CIA operative who only wants to do the right thing while being thwarted at every turn by rogue agents.  Karl Urban is great as Jason Bourne's nemesis and a worthy adversary as Bourne's Russian counterpart.  I was riveted from the first minute and anyone who enjoys well-written and well-acted action films will be, as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is a summer action flick that is meant to hold you in suspense for the duration of the movie so that the viewer can forget the hot weather outside.  And it works!  Director Paul Greengrass has dialed all of the cameras' and actors' meters to breakneck speed, and while the big screen does at times seem overwhelmed by all the blitzkrieg action, the characters appear so involved that the film is all of a piece.  Reprising their roles are Matt Damon (who handles this genre very well), Julia Stiles, a glimpse at Franka Potente, and very fine acting by Joan Allen and Brian Cox.  This is a high suspense frolic and well worth jumping on for the escapist ride.  The locales are beautiful - Goa,India, Berlin, Moscow, a New York City.  And if you can take time to notice, the musical score by John Powell has some truly beautifully written moments.  A terrific escape from the summer doldrums!</p></br><a href="../users/AESY8NCX6VS6O.html">AESY8NCX6VS6O</a><br/><p>Two years ago, (...) when The Bourne Identity turned out to be a good movie and The Sum of All Fears, well, sucked. He's back in full force with the sequel, part two of three, a movie that not only improves on the original but really sets the bar high for the third and final film. In the able hands of director Paul Greengrass, the movie whips and whirs along with the thrill of great storytelling, great action sequences, and really great acting. Case in point: Joan Allen. I loved her in The Contender, thought she was one of the best things about The Notebook, but she enters the realm of 'Oscar Contender' here for her fierce, engaging portrayal of Pamela Landy, easily one of the strongest female supporting roles to come along in a while. But let's not forget Matt Damon, either; he brings a complexity to a role that could have been a cardboard cut-out instead.<br /><br />  And I don't know if it's just me, but the action scenes in Supremacy tower above the first film, as well. Greengrass has wisely chosen to shoot the movie with many, many setups on action scenes, and handheld cameras throughout. Just about every violent moment in the movie ranges from engrossing to flat out pants-pissing exciting, and only in a huge car chase at the end of the film does it cross that ever-so-thin line of plausibility. Is The Bourne Supremacy a masterpiece of spy-thriller moviemaking? Nah, not really. But these kinds of movies are a dime a dozen lately, and when one as technically assured and extremely well-acted as Bourne hits screens, it's obvious that it's worth every penny of those 7 bucks. GRADE: B+</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>The Bourne is back, as played by Matt Damon, in &quot;The Bourne Supremacy.&quot; While the story-line and characterization improve from the mediocre first movie of this proposed trilogy, Paul Greengrass's shakycam direction and Julia Stiles's tepid acting bog it back down.<br /><br /> Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is in hiding with his leftover girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente) in India, and he has the weirdest feeling that someone is after him. It turns out that he isn't just being paranoid -- a CIA agent turns up, and Jason and Marie try to escape. After losing Marie, Jason sets out in his former life as an assassin.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, Bourne has somehow been framed for an assassination that, needless to say, he didn't carry out. Now he's a hunted man again, and he has to somehow clear his name and try to live in peace again. But with a ruthless agent on his tail (Karl Urban), his chances seem to be getting a lot slimmer.<br /><br /> It takes awhile to figure out exactly what went on in this movie -- it's all quite confusing and needlessly enigmatic. But the core of the movie is Bourne kicking butt, and they manage to pull that off pretty well -- Damon isn't a steroid hulk, and the action scenes seem to be tailored to fit around him.<br /><br /> Director Paul Greengrass seems to be under the impression that an MTV-style shakycam will give the film realism. Nope, just motion sickness. The constant jerking and wobbling are enough to make you dizzy. What's more, with the through-Bourne's-eyes method, we don't get to see half of what happens around him. Without the shakycam the film would have been far more enjoyable than it ended up being -- as it is, it just feels chaotic.<br /><br /> Damon isn't a great actor, but he's obviously giving this role his best efforts, and he gives off a kind of cold, grim intensity that's well suited to the role. Franka Potente's limp, annoying presence drops out quickly, to be replaced by the tepid but passable presence of Julia Stiles. The stars here are Joan Allen, as a tightly wound CIA official, and the coldly menacing Karl Urban as Bourne's Russian counterpart.<br /><br /> What would have been a moderately fun action flick is wrecked by the shakycam shooting style. &quot;Bourne Supremacy&quot; had promise, but on the silver screen it's suited best to people who don't get motion sick.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>I'm one of the few folks who never got around to seeing "The Bourne Identity." I can tell you, you don't have to have seen it to enjoy the sequel, since there is enough of a quick synopsis to let you know the scoop on what is going on. Bourne and his girlfriend are living out their lives in Goa, India by the beach. They are 2 of the very few white faces in town and stick out like sore thumbs. Even though they've been there quite a while, they haven't even picked up so much as a decent tan to try to blend in. A dubious Russian character plants Bourne's finger print in a conspicuous place after assassinating a CIA informant and the person the informant was trying to buy documents from in Germany. While the CIA tries to track down Bourne, the Russian goes to Goa to finish him off so that it will all look like a good clean tie-off to the intrigue - the film never explains how  the Russian traced him to India - but his blonde hair and blonde girlfriend do stick out there, after all.<br /><br />Are there holes in the plot? Sure - but everything happens so fast, you really don't notice until hours after the movie as you try to absorb everything you experience during the film.<br /><br />The language is not paint-peeling like most films today and there is no nudity or sexual activity. There is a lot of shooting, one person gets strangled to death, another drowns and many many cars get crashed all over the place. The camera play is so on target, you feel like you are in the car with Bourne as cars go zig-zagging and spinning inbetween other cars. I was literally on the edge of my seat during most of this film.<br /><br />The action is stimulating enough to appeal to the low-brow crowd and intellectually stimulating enough as to not put those with higher brain functions into a coma. My heart was beating like crazy during this film, as I felt like I was more of a participant than a viewer.<br /><br />Bourne's character is something else - he is apparently fluent in German, Hindi & Russian as well as English - and perhaps fluent in other languages as well. He is a good shot, an incredible defensive driver, sensitive, loyal, decent, articulate and just an all-around good guy who has been done wrong by many levels of government. Unlike James Bond, who is supplied by Q with the latest in technological gadgets, Bourne can make-do with anything he finds if he has to, and he doesn't have to go bed-hopping to do it. Move over, James Bond, you've met your match!</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>As others have already said, sequel territory is often littered with pitfalls, but considering the pedigree of Robert Ludlum's story (and that fact that he was executive producer) this is a very polished part II. Picking up immediately after the equally good Bourne Identity, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) returns after his self imposed exile in Goa is compromised. Implicated in a frame up, his previous employers now not only realise he is still alive, but at also large and suspect him of derailing a CIA exchange that goes awry. Filmed almost exclusively in Europe the action centers around Berlin & Moscow, and has some very impressive chase sequences and stuntwork. Damon continues to piece together his amnesia starved past, whilst trying to clear his name, and thwart the bad guys in a very fast paced cat and mouse thriller. A good supporting cast add credibilty to the story, and aside from some very choppy camera work in some action scenes, this movie is a gem. Puritans will complain about the sidestepping from the novels in places, but overall I feel this one of the top picks of the Summer releases.

Ex-CIA assasin, Jason Bourne, is now living in peace in India with his girlfriend, Marie, after leaving behind his forgotten past.  When Bourne is framed for the murder of two agents in Berlin, he must return to what he knows best to prove that he is innocent.  At times, the plot is confusing, but in the overall picture it doesn't really matter.  This movie never slows down from beginning to end.  Great action throughout, especially a high-speed car chase through the streets of Moscow, one of the best chases ever put on screen.  Plenty of exotic locations as well with Bourne globe-hopping in India, Berlin, London, and Moscow.  While the plot may at times be confusing with plenty of twists and turns, this is still a great action movie.  It isn't essential to see The Bourne Identity first, but it will help you understand more.  Highly recommended sequel.<br /><br />  Matt Damon once again is excellent as CIA assasin and amnesiac, Jason Bourne.  He is very believable as a secret agent torn apart by inner demons that he must deal with.  Franke Potente returns as Marie, Bourne's girlfriend living with him in India.  Brian Cox is also very good as Ward Abbott, CIA supervisor helping in the search for Bourne.  Joan Allen plays Pamela Landy, the CIA officer trying to track down Bourne for the murder of two of her own agents.  Karl Urban is perfectly creepy as Kirill, a Russian hitman hired to kill Bourne no matter what the cost.  The movie also stars Julia Stiles, returning as Nicky from Identity, Gabriel Mann as agent Danny Zorn, Marton Csokas as Jarda.  Highly enjoyable action/thriller with great action sequences and characters.  Once again, Matt Damon proves he can be an action star.

However last year somebody was poisoned with a radioactive isotope in a London Hotel, so nothing seems that far fetched these days!<br /><br />This is a fast-paced and gripping film that will keep you well entertained for all of its 108mins.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>The Bourne Supremacy picks up two years after the original film ended and continues to shed light on Jason Bourne's adventures.

He worked out as a failure human experiment but something goy out of control and now the things are getting worse. The whole locations and handle camera are first rate. Joan Allen shines as the implacable hunter, following every little step of Bourne through several cities.<br /><br />The main character leaded by Mark Damon I found excessively overacted. But the kinetic script makes you forget this little comment.<br /><br />Somehow this is one the few sequels that overcame the first part.

That's the major downside to this DVD which is a sophisticated Euro-thriller for the thinking movie goer.<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, the direction did not distract me nor detract from my enjoyment of this smart, above average adventure story.  It's not quite as good as the original, but definitely fun and well produced.  Thoughtfully written and beautifully acted by Matt Damon (it must drive Ben Affleck crazy that his best buddy is consistently succeeding in every department of the showbiz store!).<br /><br />The Deleted Scenes explain some major plot points...I don't understand why they weren't included in the final edit....it is not an overlong film (1 hr 49 min).<br /><br />There's a great set up for a third film...let's hope it will deliver the punch of the original and take Jason Bourne back to Europe where his adventures belong!<br /><br />Lots of fun...If you enjoyed the first, you'll at the very least *like* this one a lot.</p></br><a href="../users/A16FUU8WW76QFY.html">A16FUU8WW76QFY</a><br/><p>Matt Damon's career was near dead in the water, until 'The Bourne Identity' rescued him (he himself has intimated as much).  I don't think moviegoers really thought of Damon as an action star before 'Identity', but that's all changed now.  With 'The Bourne Supremacy' Damon does another turn as the troubled amnesiac spy/assassin Jason Bourne, and what a trip it is the second time around!<br /><br />This film is portrayed through the Bourne character's eyes and mind.  Everything moves at a breakneck on-the-fly pace, reflecting Bourne's reflexive reactions to unanticipated circumstances.  His near automatic responses seem able to get him out of almost any disaster-but Bourne is developing a consience, and feels guilty about some of his shadowy operations.<br /><br />Damon is joined by well-cast group of character actors such as Brian Cox, Julia Stiles, and Karl Urban as a Russian assassin.  They add real meat to the high octane mix of this film.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers about the manic cutting and camera shake-it is disconcerting at times.  Apparently some directors feel it is 'artsy' to do this, but it is just an irritant in this case. Other than the camera work, this is a fine action film that owes a great deal to masters of the genre (John Frankenheimer comes to mind-this film reminded me of 'Ronin').<br /><br />I enjoyed this one even more than the first film, but have to subtract one star for the overediting and camera shake.  These do have their place in an action film, but have been a bit overdone here.  Nevertheless, this is one heck of a movie...4 stars!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Dark, crisply directed, smartly written and harkening back to the 1960's style of political thriller like "The Spy Who Came in from The Cold," "The Bourne Supremacy" is the perfect antidote to the bloated, zeppelin balloon-sized messes of "I, Robot" and "The Day After Tomorrow."<br /><br />And Matt Damon's performance as Jason Bourne has now deepened and matured and in the process has become irretrievably lost, mortally wounded, deeply touching and ultimately sad. His Bourne is a man without a family, without memories, without anything resembling a life. He has been manipulated and used and lives without any hope. Damon shows us all this without much more than a glance or a look of desperation emanating from his troubled eyes.<br /><br />Like "The Bourne Identity" before it, "The Bourne Supremacy" succeeds because of the filmmakers commitment to stylish and cogent story-telling and intelligent writing.  At  "Supremacy's" end and Bourne walks off towards the horizon it is all too obvious that his so called Supremacy can only be described as that of a man forever doomed to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder, trusting no one and having nothing or no one to call his own.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is a super DVD transfer action flick that is meant to hold you in suspense for the duration of the movie so that the viewer can forget the heat of the news outside And it works! Director Paul Greengrass has dialed all of the cameras' and actors' meters to breakneck speed, and while the big screen does at times seem overwhelmed by all the blitzkrieg action, the characters appear so involved that the film is all of a piece. Reprising their roles are Matt Damon (who handles this genre very well), Julia Stiles, a glimpse at Franka Potente, and very fine acting by Joan Allen and Brian Cox. This is a high suspense frolic and well worth jumping on for the escapist ride. The locales are beautiful - Goa,India, Berlin, Moscow, a New York City. And if you can take time to notice, the musical score by John Powell has some truly beautifully written moments. A terrific escape from the media doldrums!</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>The Bourne Supremacy, the sequel to "The Bourne Identity," is a tightly wound thriller about a CIA operative with partial amnesia - he doesn't remember who he is, but he knows how to outsmart even the most savvy enemy.  Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) lives in Goa with his girlfriend (Franka Potente), trying to piece his past together with snippets of dreams and memories that he writes in a scrapbook.  When their quiet life is shattered by the appearance of an assassin, Bourne is thrust back into his old life of intrigue and danger.<br /><br />The intelligence behind the script keeps this film moving forward at a rapid, engaging clip, but the cinematography can be downright confusing.  One massive car chase is so dizzying that it is impossible to tell what is going on:  it's like watching three card Monty with a hundred cards, and you lose track of where people are.  Despite this, car chase fans will love the exhilarating screech of metal against metal, with cars flying everywhere.  The many plot levels that the film explores - the CIA's pursuit, Bourne's struggle to remember who he was, the assassins operating on their own agenda - keeps the viewer's interest from start to finish.  Damon does a good job of imbuing Bourne with a small amount of humanity struggling to assert itself.<br /><br />This film belongs to Matt Damon, and Damon fans won't be disappointed.  Fans of thrillers and action movies will love the taut suspense.</p></br><a href="../users/A2X27FQSHP418Y.html">A2X27FQSHP418Y</a><br/><p>Paul Greengrass, mark this name.... How can the studio approve such a lame picture? This movie is a swindle from beginning to end. Why? Let me explain.<br /><br />We had a previously decent, intriguing, sometimes exciting spy action thriller with THe Bourne Identity. What do we hav in this sequence? Let me answer:<br /><br />1) ZERO suspense. You can miles ahead who is (are) the bad guys. Absolutely nothing like the first movie.<br /><br />2) How can a director, ON PURPOSE, decide to shoot a film in such an obnoxious way, using a hand camera all along the way, and ordering his cameramen to shake it, shake it,  and shake it once more, and then goes into the editor's room and orders the editor to cut from frame to frame in less than a second, along THE WHOLE MOVIE. It's not only in the action scenes. It's in the WHOLE MOVIE! It's something to wonder when a director shows such contempt for his audience, not showing ONE SINGLE fight sequence in a way that we could follow! And, even doing so, he receives a lot of reviews like "Oh, except for that shaky camera work, the movie is very good..." How can a movie be good, no matter the quality of its plot, if we CAN'T WATCH IT??<br /><br />The same way that Greengrass showed contempt for me (as a member of the audience paying nine bucks for watching this mess), I show contempt for him, and I do not intend to watch any more movies directed by him. I'd also like to know if Damon has been bitten by the famous "Affleck's Virus", and began to choose his roles only for the paycheck, because I refuse to believe that he got satisfied with the final editing result of this mess.<br /><br />THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is a mess of a movei, COMPLETELY ruined by the director's choices. It's a shame that no one above him put a halt to it. Anyway, the movie is making money, so they must be proud of making audiences sick while watching it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>Who says this falls short of its predecessor! I'd say it in fact trumps the first Bourne cameo with a tighter plot, a lower body count, and just as many edge-of-the-seat jolts.<br /><br />The pivotal car chase in the movie tops most in memory, reminiscent of Ronin but set all over the world, from the unfeeling fields of Goa to the narrow streets of Berlin.<br /><br />The villain is unmasked quickly this time round, but this isn't a whodunit; it's a howdunit, keeping us riveted as we watch Bourne stay one step behind a solution and one step ahead of authorities.<br /><br />The action sequences are fascinating, including a very creative deployment of a toaster as a deadly weapon in one particularly thrilling sequence.<br /><br />Top notch stuff!</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This is one of the best sequels I have ever seen: not only does it avoid degenerating into a formula - with one of the principal characters killed off at the beginning - but it adds to the depth of all the players' characters. Bourne is still evolving in Damon's hands, becoming a new person from the confused automaton that he was in the first film, someone you can believe in and allow to enter your imagination. Of course, there are phenomenal action scenes, filmed in a you-are-there jerkiness, that reach new heights of realism in action film. (Interestingly, the director refused to use any computer animation, as he rightly knew the audience would recognise it as such.)<br /><br />But it is Damon who truly impresses: he adds creative twists to his characters like only a truly great actor can, carrying an entire environment with him you can identify with and believe, a genuine consciousness that the viewer can envision and empathise with. I would say he is this generation's Gene Hackman, a star who rises not on simple sex appeal but on outstanding acting talent. I would watch any film he is in.<br /><br />Warmly recommended. Let's hope they stop here, while the quality is maintained.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>At the end of "The Bourne Identity" Jason Bourne told his former employers that he wanted to be left alone.  He made it abundantly clear that if he felt he was being watched again, there would be no hesitation as to how fast he would return to bring the fight to their door.  Well, apparently the CIA wasn't paying attention and now they've pushed Jason Bourne too far and adventure ensues.  With many members of the original cast returning, Matt Damon being most important, and a new director (Paul Greengrass) leading the way "The Bourne Supremacy" will take audiences on another thrill ride that they won't soon forget.<br /><br />"The Bourne Supremacy" begins with Jason Bourne and his love, Marie enjoying a peaceful life far away from the insanity that plagued them during "The Bourne Identity".  Sadly, peace was not written into Jason Bourne's destiny, as someone is framing him for murder.  Now the CIA is hunting Jason yet again, and he doesn't know why they didn't listen when he told them to stay away from him, but he's going to hold up his end of the promise and now he's going to make them pay.<br /><br />A brilliant sequel to an excellent spy movie, "The Bourne Supremacy" delivers.  Frantic pacing and camera work do an excellent job of portraying the confused and fractured psyche of Jason Bourne, while not taking away from the movie.  Another terrific story with high caliber performances from the entire cast.  Leaving audiences waiting for the third installment in this hit franchise, "The Bourne Ultimatum".<br /><br />"The Bourne Supremacy" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne, ultra-tough ex-secret agent of 'Bourne Supremacy.'  The story is, you know, not so great as some say, but not so bad either.  In a nutshell, Jason, still haunted by the fragmentary memories of his past, is framed again by someone whose identity is so obvious to us.<br /><br />[ONE GREAT ADDITION] But despite the film's many plot holes and contrived (and often silly) situations, Matt Damon is in great shape as Jason, the hero or deadly killing machine.  But most remarkable acting comes not from him, but from Joan Allen as Pamela Landy as leader of one botched CIA operation, who doggedly searchs for the truths behind the failure, Jason Bourne and his backgrounds.  Franka Potente, Julia Stiles, and Brian Cox return as the same characters as before, but their characters are not as memorable as Joan Allen's, who is most convincing in otherwise completely fictional world.<br /><br />[CAMERA WILL SHAKE, RATTLE, ROLL]  But what a hectic actions!  Sadly director Paul Greengrass nearly ruined the otherwise hair-raising actions with his shaky handy camera shots, which made me dizzy while looking at the screen.  Don't get me wrong.  His method might have worked in another field, like a suspence drama with a more social theme.<br /><br />In fact, the final car chase is one of the best in recent years, accompanied by a rousing score.  My vote goes to that of 'Ronin' but 'Bourne Supremacy' comes very close to that sphere.  But Paul Greengrass's ducumentary touch camerawork which follows the objects in a too hectic fashion should be called an utterly misguided idea.  Who needs a documentary touch when you see a film based on Robert Ludlum (no offence).  It's 100 % escapism in a good sense.<br /><br />Nest time please use a steady camera angle, show the stunts's jobs clearly (and the stunts themselves must be simply great, I imagine), and give us more thrills.  That's what we want in actions, not a documentary touch.

When Jason returns from one of his routine exercise bouts he notices a man that sticks out in the crowd, which initiates a deadly hunt on Bourne.<br /><br />The cinematography in Bourne Supremacy is brilliant as it moves swiftly using unusual camera angles which generates a feeling of stress and panic. Despite this panicky atmosphere Jason Bourne moves with a directness that resembles a champion prize fighter before a fight.  This displays Matt Damon's good performance in the film where he takes care of business as some do when they pick up the mail form the mailbox.  The editing of Bourne Supremacy is excellent as there are many rapid cuts and jumps from different camera angles, similar to a comic book.  Regardless of being similar to a comic book or not, the editing works its magic as it turns up the tension and produces a highly suspenseful atmosphere.  When the story comes together under the direction of Greengrass the audience has experienced a top notch action thriller that will keep the viewers on the edge from beginning to end.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R9GZ8FC44MF5.html">A1R9GZ8FC44MF5</a><br/><p>Thats all, the car chase is barely better, and there is no other action sequence in the whole damn movie, acid trippin camera movements DONT COUNT AS ACTION SCENES, in fact they can ruin the only fight and car cahse you have (which they did), i guess they spent all their budget on all the cocaine they gave the camera guy instead of buying him a stand.

Matt Damon was BOURNE to have such a great role.  His character was BOURNE amnesiac, but BOURNE to be a hardcore fighting machine.  He's BOURNE to provide good mix of espionage and action.  And he's BOURNE to bring the best of what this movie has to offer.<br /><br />~REVIEW~<br /><br />"The Bourne Supremacy" is the second chapter of an already-popular spy-thriller series based on the best-selling books by Robert Ludlum.  Jason Bourne is back once again, beating up bad guys that get in his way with such swift charisma and a stealth ability of Sam Fisher, all in a grave search to find his unknown identity.  Whether or not he does find his true credentials., what I find in this a much deeply-plotted movie that brought my attention to its qualities that, in its rarest form, make it much better than the original.  It's a BOURNE fact, moviegoers.<br /><br />It's been a while since the original took place, and an espionage objective has occurred in Berlin thanks to the people of the CIA.  Their objective backfired, though, cause someone killed the people involve in the spy mission.  Meanwhile in India, Jason and his girlfriend, Marie, were taking it easy on the simple Hindu land after their previous adventure, or are they, `cause Jason's keep having terrible dreams about his blurry past.  Sadly, the past comes back at him, as he and his girl are on the road to get away from a Russian hitman that's following them, and the hitman killed Marie and their jeep landed on a river from the bridge, presumably dead.  What the hitman didn't know is that Bourne is still alive and he's furious enough for revenge.  Too bad one objective leads to another, because Bourne's also on the run from the CIA, who thinks the one that killed the operatives in the spy mission is him.  So now he must find the enemies that tried to assassinate him while clearing his name for murder.<br /><br />A fan's way of speaking: Bourne can kick Bond's sleazy *ouch*.  This sequel really brought out more character to the main guy.  On "Identity", I see him as a kung-fu amnesiac with plenty of arsenal and essentials; I didn't see him any different that any other movie spy out there.  But in "Supremacy", he was BOURNE to be a distinct person.  Even when he lost his loved one, he didn't go off and get another one during the whole movie; he isn't a womanizer like that certain popular British agent.  Plus, he's doesn't always keep his cool.  He's remorse about the things that happen, and confused about things he doesn't understand.  With such character development,  I started to appreciate him more, and find him much favorable.<br /><br />This movie is BOURNE to be much more story-driven than it's predecessor (although I still think it's essential to watch the first movie before this).  As the plotlines builds up, "The Bourne Supremacy" will take Matt Damon in exotic continental lo-cals such as Germany, India, and Moscow.  During his busy time running away from the CIA and finding clues that would lead to the assassins` whereabouts, he treats himself with a little bit of flashback scenarios.  These scenarios play a key role in the movie, since they fill in a few gaps for Bourne's elusive past.  The story wouldn't be as engaging if people like me are expecting some action to coincide it, and there is.  I got to find out who is the fight choreographer in this movie, because I want to applaud him (or her) for having such unusual ideas to make these fighting scenes look so awesome and swift.  There's also a few B-rated car chases to add into its adrenaline mix (as if I care about those).  Okay, the action scenes aren't as well-balanced as the story, but they're still cool to watch.<br /><br />The actors here are pretty well-rounded, not to my surprise from the cold and serious Matt Damon.  Joan Allen does just as well as the CIA agent Pamela Landy who's looking for Bourne.  Julia Stiles makes her fine second appearance in the Bourne saga as Nicky, once again; too bad she doesn't have much of a role here.  If there's anything to say about the musical score, it's Moby's "Extreme Ways" during the ending credits.  The song just fits right for the intensity of the spy-thriller.  Other than that, the score's good but it sounded similar to the original.<br /><br />THE FINAL WORD: Substantial.  Simply put, "The Bourne Supremacy" brings the cake and adds some icing in it as well.  It proves so much substance, while still having the crazy style at the same time. Yep, this movie is BOURNE to attract people looking for a good spy-action movie for the summer; it has for me.  I'm starting to look forward to "The Bourne Ultimatum" in 2006!<br /><br />Note:  I don't count "The Bourne Legacy" as part of the saga, since that story was not authorized by the same guy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>Doing away with the whole hand-holding innocent civilian tagalong effect that slowed down the original, this sequel concentrates on Jason outsmarting the entire black ops wing of the US government at every turn. With the premise set completely by the first movie, Supremacy is free to quit worrying about the setup and dive right into the action and weighty plot developments. Though I noted several scenes that were more than coincidentally similar to the original, they were each amped up a couple notches and paired with enough original material to retain a unique identity (no pun intended). The story does a fine job of picking up on the dangling threads of the original and wrapping them all up into a rewarding, conclusive finale. There was a bit too much shaky-cam in the action scenes for my liking, but this was in theaters when the concept was still fresh and it does lend a slightly more believable look and feel than you'll get from the classic polished Hollywood fights.</p></br><a href="../users/ALJGB7XHPFCR.html">ALJGB7XHPFCR</a><br/><p>This sequel to "The Bourne Identity," had much less psychological tension. This time it's just chasing, fist fighting, and shooting. Most things that made "Identity" refreshing -- the wit, the incongruity, the uncertainty, the novelty of its premise -- are gone in " Supremacy." That isn't bad, but it is disappointing for anyone who remembers what made the first movie so enjoyable. Greengrass, who directed this sequel, couples his approach with two acute mistakes in strategy: He consistently forgets to clue the audience in on basic information, such as who is shooting at whom, and why. And he films every action scene as though doing a behind-the-camera interpretive dance based on Don Knotts' classic performance in "The Shakiest Gun in the West." That said, "The Bourne Supremacy" is still definitely entertaining. More interestingly, it's a testament to Damon and what his physical presence somehow just conveys. The title, "Supremacy," promises something it doesn't deliver, something further suggested by the advertising tagline, "They should have left him alone." The title suggests a reversal of the first movie, with Bourne, in possession of himself and the facts, mounting an offensive against the people who've victimized him. But the movie is really a muddle. Bourne is improvising, getting shot at here, strangling somebody there. He has no system. There's really no villain, unless you count some nameless Russian assassin or poor Abbott, who is too much of a nervous wreck to inspire an audience's bloodlust. This whole spectacle of confusion could have been made into something with some ironic distance. But the only distance Greengrass creates is that which comes of bad technique: wobbly images, and blurred fragments. And we're in no position to appreciate the irony of the situation if we have no idea what's going on.</p></br><a href="../users/A2II09GQGWOMTQ.html">A2II09GQGWOMTQ</a><br/><p>I finally got around to watching all three Bourne movie.<br />I loved the first one but I wasn't sure if the sequels would be as good.<br />My worries were for nothing.<br />A lot of franchises blow it with the sequels, that is not the case here.<br /><br />Ok, short and sweet.<br /><br />The good?<br />Everything.<br />Everything that was good about the first one is back and bigger for the sequel.<br />More action, more story, more twists.<br />Great acting.<br />Great direction.<br />Great story.<br /><br />What was bad?<br />Really?<br />Nothing.<br />I'm thinking..........I can usually come up with at least one thing I didn't care for in a movie but I honestly can't here.<br />As far as the action/adventure/spy genre goes....<br />The Bourne movies are first rate experience from start to finish.<br />The Bourne Supremacy comes....<br />Highly Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>For a majority of it's running time, the Bourne Supremacy excells above the Bourne Identity, with Matt Damon reprising his role as the amnesiac CIA assassin, who is once again on the run after being framed for murder.  Brian Cox and Julia Stiles return as well, and Joan Allen is a welcome addition as a CIA handler trying to make sense of the conspiracy web that Bourne is tangled in.  While the action sequences are superbly done, and Damon is great as well as Bourne, the film suffers from the shaky camera work by director Paul Greengrass.  Now this may not be a huge problem for some, but there will be those who will find this utterly annoying.  Not to mention that the film itself bears little resemblance to Robert Ludlum's original work, and the dispatching of Franka Potente's character is disappointing as well, but the Bourne Supremacy gets more right than it does wrong.

The film contains alot of globehopping cat-and-mouse intrigue, thriling action setpieces and one crackerjack carchase.  Besides Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, the film offers Joan Allen, Brian Cox, and Julia Stiles in supporting roles.  What this densely plotted film does not offer is any deep character development for the actors to work with.  This film is the equivalent of fast food;easy to digest but eminently forgettable.  It's no coincidence that this film was initially released during the dog days of Summer when the mind does not need to ponder weighty issues.  That doesn't mean that a movie has to be this lightweight.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9.html">A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9</a><br/><p>The Bourne Identity was a really good movie! If you can't<br /><br />make a good sequel, why bother? This movie held my interest<br /><br />for about 20 minutes, then put me to sleep. Absolutely no<br /><br />comparison to the first! UNRECOMMENDED!</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>My only problem with the two Bourne movies has been that they seem to be too short and scream for sequels.  Matt Damon is excellent and convincing as the cool Jason Bourne, trained by a covert government agency as the ultimate assassin.<br /><br />Jason has retired with his girlfriend from the first movie and is leading a quiet life in India.  All of a sudden there is a bombing to cover up some covert crime and the bombers have placed Jason Bourne's fingerprint at the scene.  To make the frame-up complete with no witnesses, an assassin is dispatched to take care of Bourne in India.  Of course the assassin fails but kills Bourne's girlfriend in the chase that ensues.  Thus Bourne again (as in the first movie) forced to deal with people who are trying to kill him, that he has no memory of.<br /><br />Meanwhile a European CIA operative (played brilliantly by Joan Allen) starts investigating Jason Bourne's classified records and starts to ask questions about Treadstone, which brings the remaining characters from the first movie into the fray.  The CIA head that tried to bury the Treadstone project keeps warning Allen that you don't know what you're getting yourself into.<br /><br />Little by little Bourne starts to find out some things about those who are after him until he can turn the tables against them.  Julia Styles is excellent in her small role and could have been used more.<br /><br />The action and the car chases in this movie are equal to the best films around!  Damon's Bourne is one of the best government agent characters I have seen in any film.<br /><br />It definitely helps to see the first movie prior to seeing this. (also, excellent).  I saw it a few days after on cable and then saw this movie a second time and was able to more readily follow the plot.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G5LJ8T1IGYC5.html">A1G5LJ8T1IGYC5</a><br/><p>THAT'S RIGHT, I STILL HAVEN'T SEEN THE ORIGINAL FILM, BUT, I SEEN THIS SEQUEL YESTERDAY AT MY LOCAL THEATRE. AND I'LL TELL YOU THIS, THIS IS AN AWFULLY GOOD MOVIE! IN THIS ONE, AMNESIAC ASSASIN JASON BOURNE [MATT DAMON] COMES OUT OF RETIREMENT TO GO UP AGAINST A RUSSIAN HIT MAN WHO'S FRAMED HIM FOR MURDER. FULL OF SUSPENSE, HAS A LOTTA GREAT CAR CHASES, AND THE CHARACTERS ARE BELIEVABLE [WHICH IS RARE IN AN ACTION FLICK]. IF YOU WANT TO SEE A GOOD MOVIE, GET DOWN TO YOUR LOCAL THEATRE AND CHECK THIS OUT NOW!!</p></br><a href="../users/A15G70V9OBTOVO.html">A15G70V9OBTOVO</a><br/><p>I was prepared to not like Bourne II, having been warned of the fast cuts.  But they were so well done that (to me) it made perfect sense.  If any of the incidents depicted were to happen in real life the first thing people would say was "It all happened so fast..."<br /><br />Matt Damon is perfect for this because he's not cute enough to be a distraction.  Imagine Ben Affleck crashing a car and then dissapearing into a crowd in Moscow.<br /><br />Although the plot is 100% predictable the movie is fun and my 20 minute test came and went (this is when I check my watch).<br /><br />So enjoy.  And let me also reccomend the somewhat less sophisticated The Transporter.  If you're looking for Sophie's Choice, neither of these will appeal to you but but trust me, both pass the 20 minute test easily.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is in hiding.  After successfully evading the CIA in the first film, he and girlfriend Marie (Franka Portente) are living in India.  Jason still doesn't remember very many details about who he is.  But he keeps having dreams that may give him a clue.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he's about to be thrust back into the spy game.  A mission is going on in Berlin.  When it goes south, Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) wants answers.  The trail leads to a buried CIA project.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Bourne has started moving again and he trips the radar, bringing the CIA down on him.  Can he figure out why they are suddenly interested in him?  What do his dreams mean?  Will he get another piece of the puzzle of who he is?<br /><br />So I wasn't a fan of the original, but I sat down recently to watch the second one.  My main complaint about the first one was the plot.  It was better here since all the characters behaved believably the entire way through.  The plot was still needlessly confusing, and the characters are still pretty wooden.<br /><br />My biggest complaint this go around is the camera work.  It's shaky the entire way through.  What's worse are the action scenes.  They are so poorly edited it's almost impossible to follow what is happening.  I realize this is a stylistic approach, but it doesn't work.<br /><br />I can see the appeal of the franchise for those who like mindless thrill rides.  But those who look for more then that should approach with caution.</p></br><a href="../users/AEMZRE6QYVQBS.html">AEMZRE6QYVQBS</a><br/><p>My 19-year-old son doesn't go for trends and obsessions. So, when home from college on this Christmas break,  he agrees to spend two hours with us around the second of his preferred triad of films, we seize the moment by its skinny little cinematic throat.<br /><br />Two hours later ... Wow!<br /><br />Matt Damon's 'Jason Bourne' won't go away from the stained recall of compromised CIA operatives and Russian oil cartel-istas, won't go away from an amnesiac operative's self-identification-screen to let him get back to his original self, and now won't go away from our home-movie enthusiasm.<br /><br />Bring on the prequel, let us have the sequel!  I see some quick Amazon orders of used DVDs in our (very near) future.<br /><br />The plot will be well-known to readers of this review or, alternatively, available from myriad reviews. Let me point my minutes at softer targets:<br /><br />(a) The pace: this movie you up from start to finish. There is not a moment to rest. Plot-challenged viewers like this reviewer will want to make careful mental note of the spare fingerprint and such.<br /><br />(b) The music: John Powell's soundtrack cooperates beautifully with the plot. If you normally experience film music merely at the subliminal level, this would be a good film on which to bring it up the level of consciousness. I plan to buy (and review) the soundtrack. 'Very strong music.<br /><br />(c) Acting: Damon is superb. But don't miss Brian Cox as the tortured and slightly repugnant Ward Abbot, who just wants to enjoy his hard-earned influence for another year before retiring to a couple of consultancies. His life is oddly interrupted (and then, for that matter, ended) by the stubborn researches of Pamela Landy. Pay attention to this strong support role too, ably performed by the intensely attractive Joan Allen.<br /><br />I need to end this review now, perhaps a bit prematurely. I need to go get two other movies!</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>Plenty of shootings and car chases but nothing to get excited about.  Some of the plot hooks seemed far-fetched (but maybe they make more sense if you've seen the first movie).  For some reason, I have a problem seeing Matt Damon as an "action hero."  Overall, the movie is o.k. as long as you're not expecting too much.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>Felt like I went on a trip after seeing this movie. This movie was well worth it. Featuring exotic locations and car chases that are really captivating. The characters in the movie played their parts convincingly well, that you felt part of the movie.<br /><br />The sequel further develops the character of Jason Borne and provides more insights into his past as his amnesia seems to be wearing out. And how his emotional 'conflicts' are making this into a three dimensional James Bond type movie.  What can I say; this is better than Bond series, with all the actions, sophisticated car chase scenes, the cat and mouse chase and the tactic between the killing machine and the world biggest organization. The soundtrack is also great.</p></br><a href="../users/A22J9WI2PDAVJ.html">A22J9WI2PDAVJ</a><br/><p>I enjoyed the first Jason Bourne movie "The Bourne Identity".  The sequel "The Bourne Supremacy" continues on the same premise and follows Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) five years later.  Someone is trying to assassinate him at his secluded beach area of India. Now he must find out who is trying to eliminate him. And find out why!<br /><br />Jason Bourne is still uncertain of who he is and where he came from. He is a government trained assassin and slowly regaining his memory. He must get answers from his boss and the top secret government program that put a hit on him. (Trenchmark) Jason Bourne is very intelligent and resourceful of his surroundings.  Corruption is rampant.  Who is going to clean up these loose ends?<br /><br />"Supremacy" is action packed and filmed with the viewer in mind. This movie is filmed with close up action and cameras everywhere. This movie is a pure suspense thriller that fulfills the bill. Joan Allen (Pamela Landy), Julia Styles (Nicky), Karl Urban (Kirill) and Franka Potente (Marie) are outstanding in their supporting roles.<br /><br />I found out that the Director Paul Greengrass (Bloody Sunday, 2002) deliberately tries to get the viewer in each action scene. Handheld cameras where used a lot and Matt Damon did all of his stunts which makes this film entertaining.<br /><br /> I recommend purchasing this DVD because of the behind the scenes commentary.<br /><br />What I liked the most of the bonus features were the ten minute featurettes of each subject matter. Topics like action fight scenes, Go-mobile (car chases), Explosives and what is it like filming in each country. All of these subjects were commented on by director, actors and producers. Kudos to the producers for filming in the actual city and country of location: Germany, India, Russia, Italy and United States.<br /><br />Most bonus features on DVDs contain one long "Making of" feature. And you have to weed through some long commentary to find something of interest. Not on this DVD, that's why I recommend purchasing this DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>The spy thriller is very alive and well in "The Bourne Supremacy", one of the most entertaining and well-crafted movies of 2004. It's a sequel to 2002's "The Bourne Identity". In many ways it surpasses the original.<br /><br />The movie, which has a sweeping panorama of international locales, opens in India, where Jason Bourne [Matt Damon] is living with his lover, Marie [Franka Potente]. He still has amnesia, but is often awakened by nightmares about his past as a CIA agent. Meanwhile, a CIA agent is killed in Berlin. One clue is left behind by the killer - a finger print belonging to Bourne. How can this be? Bourne was 4000 miles away. Soon, Bourne is caught up in a conspiracy full of deception and dead bodies.<br /><br />Damon is again perfect as Bourne. His performance is central to the success of the movie. His is essentially a despicable character [at least as far as we know] but he makes us feel a great deal of empathy for Bourne. He is ably supported by two great actors, Joan Allen and Brian Cox, who play CIA agents out to get him.<br /><br />The drama side of "The Bourne Supremacy" is balanced by a great deal of satisfying action. For example, a car chase through the streets of Moscow that ranks as one of the most exciting ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>The one man army of Jason Bourne is back in The Bourne Supremacy (2004), and he's got a hankerin' to do what he does best, that being `bringing it on'...(I heard this phrase used by a professional wrestler on the television...am I unsure if I am using it right)...it's not like he didn't warn them (them being the secret intelligence agency he used to work for), mentioning in the previous film that if they didn't let him be, he'd bring the fight to them...and he does...directed by the relatively unknown Paul Greengrass (Bloody Sunday), the film stars Matt Damon (Rounders) reprising his role as Jason Bourne from 2002's The Bourne Identity, along with several other including Franka `homina, homina' Potente (Run Lola Run), Brian Cox (Troy), and Julia Stiles (Mona Lisa Smile).  Also appearing is Joan Allen (Pleasantville), Karl Urban (The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King), and Karel Roden, who appeared in the dreadful 2001 film 15 Minutes, starring Robert De Niro (need more proof that De Niro is certainly not exempt from bad films?  Go check out his recent, abysmal outing in Godsend...I had to go see Raging Bull after that one to reaffirm the fact that his is one of the greatest assets in Hollywood).<br /><br />The film begins with Jason (Damon) and Marie (Potente) residing `off the grid' (this term is used a few times...I thought it was kinda cool) somewhere in India.  Jason's having nightmares, enduring the side effects of his past assassin training, received during his tenure in the now defunct Treadstone project, which was basically a covert gooberment kill squad (all this is explained in the first film, so go see it).  He's still suffering from the fractal memory, but life is good...that is until an unfortunate event forces him to confront forces conspiring to use his existence for their own, nefarious means.  After one of CIA director Pamela Landry's (Allen) mission's gets messed up, she forces the Treadstone files opened (evidence indicates a former member is the one that screwed up her operation), and the hunt for Bourne is on...but Bourne is already on the move, looking to make good on his promise he made in the previous film (see my first paragraph).  The board is set, the pieces are in play, and all we have to do is sit back and enjoy the show...<br /><br />I found a lot to like about this film...I suppose because the makers tended to stick to the formula that made the first one work.  Tony Gilroy returns with a smart, fast paced screenplay (he also did the first film), but previous director Doug Liman does not, instead taking the executive producing credit, allowing for Paul Greengrass to helm this sequel, who manages maintain much of the flavor of the original, but not without a few problems.  My biggest complaint (one shared by a few people, I see) is the seemingly constant shaking of the camera, which I've now dubbed the Greengrass Syndrome.  I read that this was done on purpose, through the use of handheld cameras, to present a gritty feel, but, as with just about anything, too much can be a bad thing.  Seriously, I was wondering if the cameraman suffering the delirium tremors, figuring he was a recovering alcoholic.  That aside, everything else worked.  I thought Damon did exceptionally well, and it now appears, within this burgeoning franchise, he is the archetypal Bourne character, much like Sean Connery and the Bond films.  Of course it didn't hurt being backed by a talented and experienced supporting cast featuring Cox and Allen.  The plot was fairly intricate, but if you stay with it, it will come clean in the end.  There's quite a bit going on, and it's not always put forth in a straightforward manner, but relayed in bits and pieces, requiring some effort (and patience) from the viewer.  I did think it a little odd that Bourne could elude his former agency as well as he did, seeing as how they were the ones who trained him, but then Allen's character within the film also brought up this point, creating a sense that the writer understood beforehand that some audience members would feel this, and gave us something to identify with in the movie (I am unsure if that will make sense, but my point is Gilroy is exceptional at his craft, having the ability to anticipate his audience, and allow for it within the story).  How much of Robert Ludlum's original story made it into the film?  I couldn't tell you, but I have read that, within the novel, much of the beginning took place with Bourne in a Indian prison (this wasn't the case in the film), but then after that the script and the original story align a bit more closely.  As far as the action goes, I wasn't wanting...I was impressed with the way the film was able to balance the elements of the story and maintain a high level of action, and my interest, throughout (this was also the case with the first film).  If you like car chase scenes, there's a real doozy in here, taking place in Moscow.  Was it as good as the one in the first film?  Pretty close (Bourne crashes a whole lot more), but the frenetic, trembling camera work detracted a little...alright, I won't mention the annoying camera work again, other than to ask Greengrass to accept the fact that one can create the desired level of tension and `grittiness' filming with a Steadicam by employing a series of quick cuts.<br /><br />The widescreen anamorphic picture (2.35:1) looks wonderful (the muted colors were the director's choice), and the sound is crystal clear.  The special features (a whole slew of them) are already listed on the Amazon, so I won't bother repeating them.  If you enjoyed this film, keep your eye out for the next one, The Bourne Ultimatum, slated for release 2007.<br /><br />Cookieman108</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>In fact following the clues, one can actually think like our hero.

Can't wait to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>First of all, I like Matt Damon. He fits a certain role, it seems to me. He wouldn't do well in a suave role. He's Len Deighton's Harry Palmer in The Ipcress File, not Ian Fleming's Bond. And if the truth be known, brilliant actor that he is, I never saw Richard Chamberlain as Jason Bourne. But I do see Matt Damon. Muscled, confused, haunted. Reactionary. Bi and tri lingual. Maybe not highly intelligent but terribly well skilled in the art of killing. That's what Ludlum had him do. That was his raison d'etre. Killing.<br /><br />So here he's living like a recluse and the past reaches out and grabs him. The movie has a serene beginning, but after a few minutes of plant scenes, it's non stop action. Julia Stiles steals the show for the small time she's on film. We deserve to see more of her. And Joan Allen plays her part well as the woman manager-operative left with the mess of Treadstone.<br /><br />Can't wait for the third of the trilogy. Hope they keep Damon in it. 5 stars.

I saw the original movie, with Matt Damon as Bourne.  I remember it being much more interesting.  But this movie is so choppy and lacking in explanation.  I couldn't follow the story for the life of me.  The interaction and tension was a little high, and good, but mainly droll and boring at most times.<br /><br />I honestly didn't have a problem with the camera work.  I know that it helped me to believe that the characters were moving quickly.  And this was the effect that the director and special effects team wanted. It worked for me.<br /><br />I had a problem with the dialogue, and the interaction between the characters.  That was my main problem.<br /><br />I give this three stars as it wasn't the worst I've seen.

Bourne, the supposed rogue agent that, because of his robotic training as a government killer has amnesia and is rtying hard to hide in the hiterlands of a small beach village in India no less. Well, like his old CIA handlers have said when you are a rogue killer, even with amnesia, there's nowhere in the world you can really hide, sooner or later they'll find you.....<br /><br />And so they do, but instead of killing Bourne they kill his girlfriend forcing Bourne to face his demons and try to backtrack his amnesia plagued memory to find who is trying to get him killed.<br /><br />The movie is an action flick with a capital 'A' as we move from India to Italy, Germany and then Russia.  It's one of the better easy going entertaining films around today ....</p></br><a href="../users/A33TBHM3O9AY17.html">A33TBHM3O9AY17</a><br/><p>I recently watched "The Bourne Identity" and was enthralled by the racy mix of action, story line, and character development.  Imagine my glee when I saw "The Bourne Supremacy", which takes all the best elements of the first movie to the next level.  This easily ranks among the best action movies I have seen to date.<br /><br />"Identity" ends with Jason Bourne slipping out of the CIA snare that was laid for him, and dropping off the radar for good -- or so it seems.  "Supremacy" opens with Bourne having made a new life for himself in a remote corner of the world, while he continues to wrestle with his incomplete memories.  He is still haunted by nightmares that he can't pinpoint, and still hasn't figured out the details behind the plot to kill him.  He seems to have plenty of time to get it all worked out.<br /><br />All that changes, however, when Bourne's fingerprints appear at the scene of an assassination that he didn't commit, this time of a top CIA field operative.  The CIA doesn't know it's a frame-up, and takes very personally the death of one of their own.  Their response is, of course, to try to take out Bourne for good this time.  The first attempt on Bourne's life results in the death of his lover instead, which prompts Bourne to take the fight directly to the CIA this time.<br /><br />So begins a riveting, non-stop sequence of maneuver and counter-move, thrust and parry, as Bourne and his foes match wits and weapons in a deadly dance that will not end until Bourne is dead.  But Bourne has other plans, none of which include his own death.  He systematically begins his own investigation and retraces the steps of his own past as he strives to unlock the mysteries that continue to haunt him.  All the while, he confounds his pursuers at every turn -- somehow making it look easy, and leaving the viewer frequently breathless with suspense.<br /><br />Just like the first movie, "Supremacy" is pulse-pounding, sexy and high-tech from beginning to end.  In fact, the second movie pushes all of these elements to their credible limits.  Unlike your typical action hero flick or James Bond movie, there is not a single shred of this movie that challenges the viewer's credulity or makes you think "that could never happen in real life."  In short, this movie has all the best of the action movie genre without the corny lack of realism, coupled with high suspense that never eases up.  I can't wait for the next Bourne movie (I hope, anyway).</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>When you strip 'The Bourne Supremacy" down to its bare essentials, basically what you have is a high-powered, well-done chase movie. For the most part, it's non-stop action--and the producers were smart to enlist Paul Greenglass as the director. Greenglass films 'Supremacy' in a documentary style, making use of hand-held camera shots in many scenes. One of my favorite scenes where you really feel the events actually could have happened is when Bourne kills a fellow CIA agent in Munich and then blows up the house where the killing took place. Not only are the sequence of events leading up to the explosion choreographed masterfully(the fight scene, the lighting of the fuse, etc.) but the aftermath is equally effective--as Bourne drives away, the police are heading in the opposite direction toward the burning house which we glimpse in the distance.<br /><br />The plot to 'Supremacy' is more convoluted than complicated. In a nutshell, a rogue CIA agent conspires with Russian criminal elements to frame Bourne for two recent murders (also involving CIA agents). After a failed assassination attempt in India, Bourne escapes and is pursued by both the CIA and the Russians. Since he has amnesia, he's trying to figure out who's hunting him and why. Bourne eventually discovers he was part of a secret project called 'Treadstone' and was involved in the murder of a well-known Russian politician and his wife. The politician was set to expose the collusion between the rogue CIA agent (Abbott, convincingly played by Brian Cox) and the Russians.<br /><br />Matt Damon who plays Bourne, has very little dialogue in this movie. Damon usually gives capable performances but with little nuance. Nonetheless, the part calls for a great deal of physical action and Damon is up to the job. This is what he's good at--playing parts that require someone who's in great physical shape. What doesn't ring true is that Bourne is too much of a superman--a killing machine that basically no one can stop.<br /><br />The supporting players here are equally as good. There's a lot of nice conflict between Brian Cox's Abbott who seeks to stymie Joan Allen's Pamela Landy, the CIA deputy administrator from discovering that's he's the rogue agent responsible for all the trouble. The Russian assassin and his boss are equally realistic as menacing villains.<br /><br />'The Bourne Supremacy' was filmed on location in many different countries including India, Italy, Germany and Russia. This gives the film a great deal of its verisimilitude.<br /><br />'Supremacy' wears out its welcome in the final scenes. There's a car-chase sequence that's been done many times before and goes on for too long. And there's an additional scene tacked on at the end where Bourne visits the teenage daughter of the Russian politician where he reveals that he was actually responsible for murdering her parents. Whether Bourne was brainwashed at the time or whether he knew exactly what he was doing, the writers succeed in undermining Bourne's heroic status and we're left with a sour taste in our mouths after realizing Bourne really isn't such a good guy after all.<br /><br />Forget about Supremacy's thin plot and the Bourne character's moral turpitude. If you like non-stop action, The Bourne Supremacy is worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>Its rare that a sequel equals or surpasses the original, but I think this movie does it.  And that's quite an accomplishment given the quality of Bourne Identity.  This movie is fast paced, has a great plot and acting, and the action never lets up.  The fight scene with the other Treadstone agent is one of the best ever.  The HD DVD is beautiful and the sound is great.  I can't wait for the third installment in this great series.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>Why people hate The Bourne Supremacy I have no idea but what I loved about this sequel was they got rid of a very weak piece of the cast right in the beginning. You break your neck to see this because you want to know the rest of the story and who Jason Bourne really is but when you get to the end to find all that out and well that's all you find out.<br /><br />You don't get a plot twist or anything to make your jaw drop; you just get a plain old mediocre answer to a plain question. One example of a film with a plot somewhat related to this but made it into a giant surprise is Kill Bill and I'm saying this as in when everything was getting to the end Uma Thurman found out her daughter was still alive. While The Bourne Supremacy has a little bit of a boring ending it still is a great movie thanks to Matt Damon and a few others pulling off great fight sequences much like the first film but more extreme.<br /><br />They did manage make a much needed and surprising change in the beginning of the film that makes it better in every way. Damon definitely isn't the best actor in here once again but he is great in these action scenes. There are a few people that become backstabbers but it's nobody you didn't already guess were villains in the first film. Bourne Supremacy is worth watching but you may get bored towards the ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>It's about time the movies do justice to Robert Ludlum's breathless thrillers. BOURNE SUPREMACY (Universal) follows hard on the heels 2002's "Bourne Identity" and does not disappoint.<br /><br />Matt Damon secured action star status as Jason Bourne.  In "Identity," the amnesiac CIA agent discovers who he is.  In "Supremacy," he discovers what he is.  Director Paul Greengrass does not let up in the forward motion of the relentlessly face-paced story when Bourne, seeking some kind of redemption for the unwanted killer identity he has discovered about himself, is framed for murder in Berlin.<br /><br />A surfeit of cool extras include better than average documentaries on the casting, photography and action sequences (car chases, fight scenes and explosions).  The startling deleted scenes are worth checking out and actually add something to the film. The informative commentary from Greengrass is actually worth listening to.</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>...not surprising since there's a different director---Paul Greengrass isn't bad, he just isn't anywhere as good as Doug Lyman, who did "The Bourene Identity."<br /><br />Lyman's film flowed effortlessly and seamlessly...it was difficult to immediately recognize the standard plot structure, e.g. "Oh, this is Act One, and oh, now we're moving into Act Two, and now this is the clean resolution of Act Three."  Unlike the first Bourne movie, there are a few slow spots here, and killing off Franka Potente during the first ten minutes of the film most DEFINITELY doesn't help matters whatsoever.<br /><br />In fact, this film is pretty much painting-by-numbers: we know full well that Bourne is going to be out to avenge his oh-so-cute German babe, and that again he is being framed for something he didn't do but that he will again prevail agaisnt all odds.  Even the fight scenes (there's only one really major one) are weak, and when we see him escape half of the Berlin police force by climbing up the side of a building yet AGAIN it's hard not to make another beer run.  While in some respects more spectacularly filmed due to Greengrass's documentary-making background than the one in the first film (through Paris), the Big Car Chase through the streets of Moscow also feels rehashed.<br /><br />Then there is the penultimate BIG DRAMATIC SCENE in which Bourne apologizes to one of his past victims...dialogue, acting, and camera are all wrong, and it's hard not to feel sorry for Matt Damon being stretched far beyond his limited abilities as an actor.<br /><br />If such things above don't bother you, chances are you'll enjoy this movie just fine.  Joan Allen easily has the best screen presence in this film and is a pleasure to watch.  This DVD is very well-stocked with all kinds of bonus features, so if you liked this film in the cinema it would probably be worth owning.<br /><br />Me personally, Netflixing it once was enough.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>It has been two years since we last saw Jason Bourne (Damon), and in that time he has been trying to live a &quot;normal&quot; life with his girlfriend Marie (Potente) in India. But quickly, two things go wrong for him. First, someone has killed a CIA agent and planted clues that point to Bourne as the murderer. Second, an assassin has arrived in India to kill him.<br /><br /> While dodging the assassin, he attempts to track down the CIA team that is after him. While the team leader, Pamela Landy (Allen) is new to the situation, Bourne's old boss, Ward Abbott (Cox) is also in the mix. What follows is basically a revenge movie filled with action and intense chase scenes. The final chase is expecially edge-of-your-seat cinema.<br /><br /> Almost all the cast and crew are back for the second installment of the Bourne series, and that provides a nice feeling of continuity. Certainly, the third novel in the series will be made into a movie, and hopefully the same continuity will be preserved with that one as well. Matt Damon once again is the surprising action hero, a role that one would not have thought possible of him a few years ago. Brian Cox is his usual delisiously evil self playing a character whose motives are unclear.<br /><br /> If you found &quot;The Bourne Identy&quot; entertaining, you will not be disappointed with &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot;. It is a good, smart action movie that keeps you involved from beginning to end. Bring on &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot;!</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>I must first say that I have not read this book, I am purely basing this review off the film that I just witnessed. When I watched the Bourne Identity, I was taken aback. While I didn't think that it was the best film out there, I did see potential and some very exciting location scenes. It was as if we were witnessing an American James Bond being Bourne (sorry, no more puns...). This original film kept me on my seat and excited about the characters during the two hour run. Sadly, I cannot say the same for the sequel, The Bourne Supremacy. It seemed, and felt, as if this was a harder book to put into a film. Perhaps it was the direction, or even the screenplay, but there was way too much happening in the short 109 minutes that this film ran. From inconsistent flashbacks to a feeling that you had to memorize the first film to get this one, I felt the Bourne Supremacy was like a spilled bucket of nails ... bits and pieces were all over the place, and it hurt to pick them all up at once.<br /><br />Damon seemed to do well revisiting his character of Jason Bourne, a bit more stable than in the original, his combination of two facial expressions helped push me through the rest of this film. Brian Cox is Brian Cox, his characters seem to always be very similar in nature. He looks gruff, but does he always need to act gruff? Joan Allen felt as if she had something up her rumpus throughout the entire film. Her character had no emotion, no expression, and no excitement, which eventually was pushed off onto me. She ruined this film. I could not stand watching her on screen, I felt that she had no chemistry with the rest of the cast and that she was involved only to collect the much needed paycheck. Did anyone else feel as if you were watching another version of X-Men? Wolverine can't remember his past and the Brian Cox connection? I guess I let my mind wander too much through this film or maybe I just wanted to re-watch that film instead, but there was this eerie resemblance that hovered over my mind.<br /><br />So, we have sub-par actors trying to build some intensity and ultimately failing? What else could go wrong? Well, how about the shambled mess of plots known as the "story"? What was going on here. I felt as if I was being pulled in about a thousand different directions. I am a huge fan of the multi-layered stories, but only if they have some logical connection between them. There was no connection in this story. While director Greengrass attempted in every way possible to keep us in step with Bourne, you couldn't help but get lost. Literally, I felt as if I needed a road map when I rented this film. What does this tell you? Instead of the choppy, unsteady-cam flashback sequences, Greengrass should have spent a bit more time on some back-story or development. The drunken flashback moments just didn't work for me. I felt as if I could have understood this film a bit better by getting intoxicated myself, instead of allowing the director to do it for me. I was lost. It really felt as if they were grabbing at anything possible to connect this espionage thriller together. There was bad glue and I couldn't understand why nobody saw this.<br /><br />Actors being average (or below average) coupled with a broken, choppy story is no way to bring us a sequel. I guess if you wanted to build a better reputation on the original you would release a film like this. I should check the latest reports on how The Bourne Identity is doing in rental and sales to see if this is true. When you go into a sequel, you expect to see similar faces, bigger effects, and/or a deeper story. What instead occurred with The Bourne Supremacy were similar yet under-producing faces, no better effects (the car chase doesn't count since you can see that in nearly every other action/espionage film), and a story that ranks among the worst Hollywood has to offer. I am not sure how closely it is to Ludlum's story, but I have a feeling he may not be as happy with this endeavor. It was a brutal mutilation of his characters.<br /><br />Overall, I was not impressed. My wife didn't even make it through the film because it gave us both headaches. Damon can do Bourne well, but the material that he was handed to this film should have been reconsidered. Perhaps a new director would have worked to give a new image to the Bourne name and style. Either way, something needed to be done and it wasn't. This was a poor excuse for a sequel and a dark chapter in this seemingly exciting character's life. Skip it. I promise it will make you a better person.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>As agent Bourne runs frantically from continent to continent to escape his hunters he drops a suitcase. This is early in the film. What's in that suitcase? The plot. Some acting. Large dosages of common sense. Oh, and the script. Sadly, the suitcase and its contents never get recovered.<br /><br />  While the first Bourne installment was one of those rare cases of action films that actually did have a plausible story, good acting and directing, this one lacks all three. And lacking on all three it even adds up some further faults to undermine the whole affair even more.<br /><br />  The curse of the sequels? It hardly matters since as a sequel this film is simply a ghost of its predecessor, and a very unconvincing ghost at that.<br /><br />  The director decided to employ this simple trick: seeing that he's got zero plot to work with, he manically over-edited the film creating something that looks like a hyper-extended version of a long video clip. As it is with such video clips, your interest in the film will probably last a brave 10-15 minutes and it will all go downhill from there on.<br /><br />  There's no need to go deeper into this. Anyone who's seen it knows it has very little to do with the very succesful "Bourne Identity". That in turn is a pity because the first film had all the elements in place to keep the recipe functional in the sequel as well.<br /><br />  Why was it all discarded then? We wont know and we wont care.<br /><br />  At my kindest, i'd say this is worth the rental but then make sure you've got some friends over and several alternative plans on what to do when your eyes start wandering off the screen and onto other things.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GYX971VETQBV.html">A2GYX971VETQBV</a><br/><p>Well, I won't bore you all with another long rant about the shaky camera sequences and split-second scene changes.  They're both in here all over the place and I have my own qualms with them.  But honestly, folks, does this make or break the film for you?  If anything, I believe that all of the commentary on the "shaky-cam" techniques points to a far deeper problem lurking in THE BOURNE SUPREMACY: the lack of a logical and interesting plotline.  Sure, there are some pluses in this film.  I really enjoy watching Matt Damon as an action/spy hero.  He's good at it and believable.  I love seeing him take out squadrons of men with a few martial arts moves and escape from impossible situations with ease and flare.  He handles the dueling characteristics of brains and brawn quite well and can also handle women.  I just wish that he would do so inside of a film that made sense and was interesting.<br /><br />Of course, I am not asking for a completely realistic action film.  Such a thing is impossible, perhaps, and would be boring if it were actually accomplished.  No...what I ask for is simply an entertaining action storyline that flows from point-to-point with logical grace and simplicity.  Much of the storyline in THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is simply hard to follow and extraneous.  We love to see our action hero fighting against the best of the best.  We just want to know why he is doing it.<br /><br />I honestly hope that we have not seen the last of Jason Bourne.  Matt Damon is very interesting to watch and I feel that with a better plotline this series can be recovered.  If you enjoyed THE BOURNE IDENTITY, you'll want to check out this film.  But for several reasons I feel that THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is inferior to its predecessor.  Let's hope a third can reclaim Bourne's identity among the great spy flicks of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PMQH87R1H3QU.html">A2PMQH87R1H3QU</a><br/><p>I really liked the first one..but i bought the DVD,when they came out with ,then about few months after,they came out with extra footage an all..this time i am gonna wait might about few months they comes with unrated version an DTS sound an all...so dont waste ur money on this DVD, like i  did..i am pretty sure they comes with some unrated version or superbit or something like that down the road like they did with last one.. if u really wanna see it, just rent the movie insted for now!</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>Sequels do not always pan out. As many people would agree, riding on the back of a box office hit is usually an effort to make more cash, and as a result, the quality of the sequel reflects this. Not so with The Bourne Supremacy. In many ways it's better than the first, in terms of tight editing, Damon's overall performance, and that over the top car chase through the streets of Moscow, at the end of the film, which had me gripping the arm rests of my seat.<br /><br />Matt Damon was recently here in Melbourne promoting the film and he worked hard, appearing on every major Australian talk show as well as several popular morning radio stations. Australians like Matt Damon because he comes across as honest, no pretenses, your average all-American clean cut young man. In fact I remember him saying in one of his interviews that he was hesitant to do the sequel because he was afraid the quality of the film would suffer, but he ended up agreeing to do the project when he found out who would be directing. Paul Greengrass did a fine job, as the realism of the picture is first rate. Originally a documentary filmmaker, he brought his sense of realism to the project. Some have commented that the editing was too tight, jagged in places, almost acting as a distraction. Perhaps this is true in places, but generally, in my opinion, the editing was a work of art - well timed and realistic.<br /><br />This is a great action film sequel that in some cases surpassed the original.<br /><br />A strong four and a half stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>THE BOURNE SUPREMACY begins two years after THE BOURNE IDENTITY left off. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) has been quietly living in Goa, India with girlfriend Marie. He still suffers from amnesia and can't remember much about his past except for snippets that come to him in dreams. He writes these things down in a journal trying to piece together his forgotten and shattered past.  Meanwhile, back in Berlin, an expensive and important CIA operation is blotched when some important files are stolen and a key informant is killed. The killer "leaves" a fingerprint behind and the print turns out to belong to Jason Bourne.  This leads Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) to begin a worldwide search for Bourne to bring him in for questioning. Back in India, Jason and Marie plan their get away from a Russian hitman, but things turn tragic. Two years ago Bourne told the CIA to leave him alone. He thinks they're after him again and he begins a mission to show the intelligent agency just who really is supreme.<br /><br />THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is a worthy sequel to the original THE BOURNE IDENTITY. The movie continues the story and as the film develops, we learn more not only about Bourne's past, but about other characters from the original film, too. The acting is extremely well done, especially for an action/espionage movie. Especially noteworthy is Matt Damon who portrays Bourne perfectly. One of the tag lines for the film "Matt Damon is Jason Bourne" isn't just a cool saying.<br /><br />The only major negative I found with the movie was quick cuts from one scene to another. I don't know why this has become the popular thing to do with fighting movies nowadays, but instead of making a film or movie more interesting, it proves to be a big distraction.  It leaves the audience wondering exactly what went on and unless it's a thinking movie, you should never leave an audience wondering what went happened. But other than that, it's all good.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>Paul Greengrass' "The Bourne Supremacy" may be a lightweight summer movie, but while you're watching it it will keep you on the edge of your seat. This sequel to "The Bourne Identity" has Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) out to clear his name and save his own life after being framed for the murder of two CIA operatives in Berlin. Racing across India, Berlin and Moscow, Bourne does battle with a murderous assassin (Karl Urban, unrecognizable from his turn as the noble warrior Eomer in "The Lord of the Rings") and two squabbling CIA division chiefs (Joan Allen, Brian Cox). There are car chases, shootings and stunts galore, and Greengrass doesn't miss a trick in keeping the film moving at breakneck speed. Damon, all traces of his "Good Will Hunting" baby fat gone, is a thoroughly believable action hero, and the rest of the cast--particularly Allen and Cox--is quite fine. Like a ride on a particularly slick rollercoaster, "The Bourne Supremacy" is a fine way to pass the time on a lazy summer day.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>Cool, confident, professional, &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; cements the franchise as the intellectual alternative to the now goofy, effects-dripping James Bond series. Immersed in the spy world without posting blinking signs to the genre - minimum gadgetry - the movie is a brisk, excellent global tour of international politics.<br /><br /> In Matt Damon, the series, mined from Robert Ludlum's novels, has a man of everyday, blockheaded features capable of physical extremes; this is not Tom Cruise tossing back his hair, suspended in vanity from a rock. There is moment when Jason Bourne, in mourning, looks pinched and ugly, an excellent capture of sadness. Bourne barely breathes in this movie, and he doesn't speak much more. Waste in not in his vocab, nor the film's.<br /><br /> Still haunted by memories of the mission that helped trigger his amnesia in &quot;Identity,&quot; the first film, Bourne has found a ocean hideout in Goa, India with girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente). Across the world, in Berlin, Bourne is being framed for two murders in a CIA sting gone bad. Soon after, a Russian assassin (Karl Urban, excellent if virtually silent) is after Bourne and Marie, who is killed after a car accident on a bridge. Bourne is then onto Naples, Italy, where he must reenter the CIA grid as deputy directors Pamela Lundy (Joan Allen) and Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) wait to descend. Both want Bourne. Lundy prefers him alive; Abbott pushes for death. Bourne seeks his framers and the source of his dreams. It leads to Room 645 in a Berlin hotel.<br /><br /> As a young colleague (Julia Stiles, in garish highlights) puts it, Bourne doesn't make mistakes, he makes moves, drawing the crosshairs closer, the better to learn his captors motives. He lands in three major jams, the last pitting him against that Russian assassin, every bit Bourne's equal, in a Moscow tunnel. Staged by director Paul Greengrass, these public chases are feats of speed and editing, daring enough to admire Bourne's considerable spy skills while still this side of believable - Damon sustains a limp after landing hard on a barge. As in the first movie, boxy European four-doors are the vehicles of choice as Bourne evades his captors - slow, yet seeming to endure almost endless structual damage, they are mechanical companions to Bourne. Functional, indestructible.<br /><br /> Joan Allen, glaring soft like steel wool, is perfectly cast as CIA ice queen Lundy - by-the-book and clever, but not Jason Bourne clever. But Cox, as Abbott, is hamstrung by the red arrow pointing at his character. Tony Gilroy returns for the screenplay, and it is again literate, hushed and direct, proving that stories absent of joy - gray skies abound, and Moscow simply doesn't play host to happiness - still entertain through the force of their intelligent gambits. Whereas the Jack Ryan series got caught up with the pedestrian manliness of Harrison Ford, &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; is content to keep working the angles, the reward being a night of sleep, or a simple, overdue apology. It's spy food for those with perspective.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>If you're looking for an intelligent action film, this is it!  Knowing little about Bourne adds to the intrigue and mystery of the character.  You never know quite what he's going to do when things get tough, but you know someone is going to pay for starting something with the wrong guy!  A real rollercoaster of a movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>You know something? Those of us who live our lives in the sunlit spaces of what we call "Normalcy" don't have a clue about the deep, dark, furiously deadly undertows all about us.<br /><br />Most do their 9-to-5 routine, pay their bills, take care of their taxes in an annual routine of Dread, nurture families, make and break friendships, launch and end affairs, and a million other exigencies of life, all while getting their food---caught, fattened, slaughtered, and packaged, ultimately bearing little resemblance to a beast or fowl---from well-stocked superstore shelves.<br /><br />We live in such a state, a highly unnatural state, because our Rulers have enlisted King Cobras to go forth and do our battles for us. Proxy warriors.<br /><br />They slip through the streets of a million metropolises, plumb the information oubliettes of a bilion backwater dive-bars. They are professional Killers, and you'll only see one of them about 1/5th of a second before you breathe your last breath.<br /><br />As one CIA analyst says, "these people do not make mistakes." They don't have time to: the world they do their bloody business in is fast and brutal, operates by the Law of the Microchip, and is unforgiving as Hell.<br /><br />James Bond? Please. By the time Bond was halfway through one of his droll quips he'd be dead in the real world.<br /><br />Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, whose Bourne is both kinetically, cracklingly alive and still calm and calculating), until recently, was one of those King Cobras.<br /><br />Still suffering from partial amnesia, not wholly confident in what he may have done for the infamous CIA "Treadstone Project", haunted by nightmares, Bourne and girlfriend Marie (the lush Franka Potente) are a world away from the events of "Bourne Identity", submerged beneath new names (though not faces, alas), tucked away in a remote corner of India.<br /><br />Except, as Bourne finds out, when a Berlin CIA operation goes bad and Trouble comes calling with hollow points, there ain't any such thing as remote.<br /><br />Framed for a murder he didn't commit, implicated by fingerprints that aren't his, dimly suspicious that Treadstone may still be up and running and looking for blood, Bourne runs himself to ground in Naples, using his own passport---and the Hunt is on.<br /><br />Both "Bourne" movies are prime examples of how *to* make a good espionage thriller: "Supremacy" is smart, fast, edgy, and deadly, like a John Le Carre novel told from a field agent's point of view. There is little, if any, margin for error: make a mistake, trigger the men in black *and* the local fuzz, and you won't be making it back to the hotel for a late night Martini, shaken not stirred.<br /><br />The plot? Suffice it to say that it involves Russian mobsters with Langley connections, and that it is partly about revenge and substantially about getting answers. That's all you really need to know.<br /><br />Like its predecessor, "Supremacy" is shot with skill and authority: like its cold-bloodedly efficient killers, "Supremacy" Director of Photography Oliver Wood doesn't have to plump up the material with showy techniques. His camera moves in for the kill, arcs over to its target, jounces along after the subject like a war photographer when it must, and gets the job done.<br /><br />It's amusing that some have complained about Wood's cinematography: he did the camera-work for "Identity", and (rejoice!) will be helming the shooting for "Bourne Ultimatum". I'm not a big fan of jerky camera-work and so I was bracing myself for this film; with a widescreen print of the film and a proper widescreen TV, the only time the camera bounces around is when it wants to enhance the action.<br /><br />Ultimate credit goes to Peter Greengrass, who takes the directorial duties away from "Identity"'s director Eric Lyman. Greengrass has a fine sense of what works, and subordinates everything in "Supremacy"---the use of lighting, the frenzied chases through Berlin, Naples, and Moscow, the actors, even the soundtrack and camerawork---to serve the movie's overarching objective.<br /><br />A good example---one of my favorites in "Supremacy"---is Bourne's brutal melee with former Treadstone spook Jarda (Martin Csokas): no soundtrack, totally edgy, very raw, two trained killers beating each other to death (one handcuffed!) with whatever means are available.<br /><br />The camerawork moves with the two fighters---not stagey at all, this is not a Bond fight---but the more organic perspective serves to bring you into this duel to the death.<br /><br />Another thing I respect about "Supremacy": the absolute lack of lard on this bad boy. In this era of cinematic bloat, the crucial job of editing---what to cut, what to leave in, and how to cut scenes to maximize dramatic effect---isn't always appreciated.<br /><br />"Supremacy" succeeds because it has no body-fat: every scene must tell, which makes you care about Jason Bourne all the more. Congrats to Christopher Rouse (from "Identity") and Richard Pearson for editing "Supremacy" so tight you could practically hear the film scream.<br /><br />Those who grooved on the helter-skelter chase sequences of "Identity" will relish Greengrass's serving up more of the same---only Greengrass ups the ante, both in terms of the pursuit, but also in terms of the fiendish inventiveness---and deadliness---of Jason Bourne himself, the Pursued. The chase through nocturnal Berlin is one of the craziest things I've ever seen on screen, and a true nail-biter.<br /><br />All the acting is note-perfect: Damon is tightly focused---but torn---Angel of Death, Karl Urban (Kirill) shines as his furiously efficient nemesis, Brian Cox looks fatter and more anxious as CIA spook Ward Abbott, and Joan Allen is all business as the new CIA Deputy Director.<br /><br />Taut, gripping, brutally paced, "Bourne Supremacy" is as merciless as a drive-by shooting and as cool as the metal on a silencer at 3 AM on a Siberian morning. Check it out.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/AWJOVW1BZZ34H.html">AWJOVW1BZZ34H</a><br/><p>Action packed sequel, that overall is enjoyable, but the story could have been told better. In this one Bourne has lost his memory and is being pursued by assasins while being framed for murder at the same time.

I hope the third installment is better.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U6B2LDK3BUVU.html">A1U6B2LDK3BUVU</a><br/><p>I'm giving this movie three stars because it held my interest.  That's the single most important thing a movie must do.  It has to hold the audience's interest.<br /><br />Now for the flaws.  The directing sells sizzle rather than steak, and belongs to the school of Fake it til you make it.  What it does is shoot the action scenes in a purposely confusing way, obfuscation, sort of like a football tv director deciding not to show you the runner evading tacklers and crossing yard lines but rather just showing you things too close up, just a blur, and then he crosses the goal line.  The theory is apparently to keep you on your toes trying to find out what the hell is going on, assuming that this technique will impress you.  I'd rather not play that game.  I'd rather see what is going on.<br /><br />Another major flaw is that the star "never makes a mistake", as one of his opponents in the CIA puts it.  That's nice.  Nice little super hero.  Always does exactly the right thing, never makes a mistake.  That only happens in movie scripts, dummy.  That turns this story into a comic book.  Nothing human here.<br /><br />Actors are too good looking, too acceptable looking.  Give me an ugly lead.  Give me overweight women, plain looking women, women you will actually see on this planet we call Earth.  We as a film audience have accepted the Lala Land these idiots have been painting for us for decades.  Give me some reality.  All this perfection has gone beyond boredom and into the realm of stupid.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFNOZKR9WTYI.html">AIFNOZKR9WTYI</a><br/><p>While watching the first minutes of the movie, I began counting seconds between cuts.  The consistent rhythm of the movie is one cut every three seconds, more if there is anything actually happening.  Bourne could be sitting on a beach.  There's a cut of his profile, the seascape, the unwashed travellers parading the strand, back to Bourne, lets get an X-Ray of him so we can look at him from inside as well.  Ok, so the director is a total piece of rubbish, I say to myself.  So I have to "watch" the movie by looking away from the screen.  So  the fight scenes are covered in such a disjointed way as to make it impossible to tell who is doing what to whom at any point in time ("he's... he's got his leg... no, wait, that's not Bourne... he's... its some kind of joint lock... no, that's a lamp...) so the movie is unwatchable trash, in other words... so what? Weeeeel, it also turns out that the writing is utter drivel.  The CIA is apparently an organization with no chain of command whatsoever.  In any "meeting" - which is a loosely constituted group of three or more employees, everyone just mouths off and says the first thing that comes to mind, regardless of rank.  Nobody is in charge.  It is just a free-for-all of self-expression, with people basically just getting hot with eachother and getting emotional, saying things like, "You act like you're reading this out of a book!" and then stalking off.  I guess liberals think the entire world operates like they do.</p></br><a href="../users/A331OF34UX4Y1K.html">A331OF34UX4Y1K</a><br/><p>It's incredible how sometimes a movie sometimes has the "blessing" of all the media...

Don't believe all these lies. Whatever merits this movie may have, they are ruined by one single fact: THE EDITING OF THIS MOVIE SUC..S!! It's the worst I've seen in a long time. It's video clip / MTV edition all the way, you can not follow the car chase or the fights. It's annoying, really annoying. The camera don't star  "firm" in position for more than one half of a second<br /><br />The lack of quality of the story is another point. It's much less, I mean MUCH LESS, suspenseful than the first one. Youc an see miles away waht happened.<br /><br />I don't recommend this movie wven for rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I liked this movie better than the first for a couple of reasons. First and for most (SPOILER ALERT)...<br /><br />They kill off his ugly dog faced girlfriend right at the beginning.<br /><br />A couple of other reasons are these:<br /><br />1)Brian Cox is a great actor and is good in everything I have seen him in.<br /><br />2)Joan Allen is also great.<br /><br />3) Julia Styles... not so great. Why the hell she was even in the first one is beyond me. For god sake she stinks as an actress but her part in the first one was almost nonexistent so I can only assume a great majority of her part must have ended up on the cutting room floor, no great loss. But then they bring this schlub of an actress back and expand her part. The only thing that was good about her was when I thought that Jason Bourne might actually be ruthless enough to kill her.<br /><br />The villians in this are also really good.  Damon is pretty good as an actor though his really large head is sometimes distracting but he makes his buddy Bad Actor...er... I mean Affleck look like somebody from you kindergarten play that portrayed a tree cause he couldn't keep his booger eatin' finger out of his nose long enough to speak and chew gum at the same time.

They circulate in the world as if they knew no borders, no limits and they carry on their business without considering in any way the people, the interest of the world itself. They have their objectives and it is to dominate and manipulate the powerful in the world and eliminate them if by any chance they became rowdy or rebellious. This film is no exception in the genre. An ex-agent from a totally secret group of ? cleaners ? has survived the end of his group and is hunted by some other secret agents, from Russia actually, to cover up an old operation that failed. This ex-agent is challenged in his ? retirement ? and gets back on the road to find the truth he has mostly forgotten and to eliminate those who are menacing him and have killed his woman-friend, his love. He finds out that the failed operation had been under scrutiny by the CIA and that he has been trapped into another failed operation. But this second failure was planned by the boss of the CIA himself because the documents the CIA was on the point of buying would have revealed his implication in the first failure as the one who organized the stealing of twenty million dollars by a future Russian oil-tycoon. His interest as the CIA boss was to push Russia into wild capitalism to undermine the power of the Russian state, and as an individual it was the financial kickbacks he got from this newly born oil tycoon. The ex-agent manages to go up the trail and get to him and, finding out what was his role in the first failure, he is able to force him to confess, on tape, and to commit suicide. Then he only had to evade the Russian secret services who are backing the oil-tycoon. He eliminates the agent who was tracking him, he apologizes to the daughter of the two people he executed in the first failed operation and he disappears again to finally come back to the new head of the CIA, the woman who had re-opened his file to find the truth about the first failed operation, and force her to classify his file and reveal him his true identity that he had forgotten due to the multiple identities he had had in his spying life. This film is pure action, and yet it entertains the vision of a democratic state that is totalitarian through some secret agencies that are there to prevent any change in the balance of power in our countries and in the world. Thus there seems to be some Big Brother behind the decor of our government from the people, for the people and by the people. The people appears in this film as a mass of non-significant puppets unconsciously strutting in the streets and other public places totally unaware of what is going on in their backs. And yet there is an escape for the ex-agent, an escape that is purely selfish and unethical because it protects him but reinforces the secret agency with the end of the challenge to it that he represented. It is a Big Brother that is multiplied into absolute and totally untouchable immunity. Frightening and sickening. And if it were true ? Stephen King, when dealing with such an agency, goes right through to destroying it, like in Firestarter. That is more reassuring for us : this secret agency can be challenged and curbed into some legality. In this film none of these ethics. Total fatality and acceptance.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>WOW! WHAT AN ADRENILEN RUSH.

So many have fallen by the wayside, and sequels don't hold much credibility these days, with CGI and gimmicky concepts, especially when Hollywood is churning them when they're not even necessary.<br /><br />But Bourne Identity needed a sequel, to carry on the story of Jason Bourne, to see if he recovers anymore of his memory. Two years after the first finished, Jason & Marie are in India, living off the grid, enjoying life and each other. Until something tragic happens, and Jason is once more on the run, running from himself, and discovering on the way, that he's been framed for two murders. He's still having recurring nightmares, and is still trying to piece together his former life.<br /><br />The action scenes are absolutely stunning, an amazing follow up to Identity, with an even better car chase than the original, in a taxi, which soon gets wrecked. Bourne even surpasses himself, when in Identity, he fought an enemy with a pen, he now fights an enemy with a rolled up newspaper!<br /><br />I'm still disappointed at Julia Stiles' screen time in this, a gripe which has carried on from Identity. While she has marginally more screen time than the first, it's still not enough for a great actress as she is, trying to spreak her wings past her teenage film roles. Brian Cox has a little bit more revealed about his character, and all is not what it seems with him!<br /><br />Supremacy is an excellent follow up to an already excellent original movie, and I look forward to seeing exactly what happens to Bourne in Ultimatium. I hope everything is resolved nicely. It's quite strange, because the end of Ultimatium is actually shown at the end of Supremacy, a strange tactic, but something that leaves the viewers wanting more.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2<br /><br />Matt Damon returns as secret agent Jason Bourne in "The Bourne Supremacy," a first-rate espionage thriller that boasts a fine performance from the always reliable Joan Allen as well.<br /><br />The character made his first screen appearance in the wildly popular "The Bourne Identity" in 2002, a film based, as this one is, on a Robert Ludlow novel.  Bourne is one of a handful of agents who have been turned into little more than mindless killing machines through a (now defunct) top secret mind-altering program.  Despite suffering from a case of amnesia that has effective wiped out all memory of that time in his life, Bourne still has to deal with the guilt that comes from knowing all the horrible things he must have done while under the influence of the diabolical programming. As "The Bourne Supremacy" opens, we find Jason living in India, trying to maintain a low profile as he attempts to create some kind of a "normal" life for himself and his girlfriend.  But, as always happens in these kinds of scenarios, reality intervenes, this time in the form of assassins sent out to kill him.  As if that weren't enough, Bourne is also being hunted by some CIA bosses who mistakenly believe that he has recently killed two of their own agents.  Thus, Bourne finds himself running for his life in a chase that takes him from India to Berlin to Moscow before the movie is over.<br /><br />With the Ludlow novel as his source, Tony Gilroy has written a complex screenplay that respects the audience's intelligence even when what is happening on screen doesn't always rate too high on the plausibility meter.  Amidst all the convoluted plotting, espionage doublespeak and hi-tech hardware that are the standard accoutrements for the genre, Gilroy manages to stay focused on the human drama at the story`s core, as a man struggles to piece together the puzzle of his life.  Allen makes an effective foil as the agent who first suspects Bourne of killing some of her undercover operatives, then comes to believe in his innocence.  Director Paul Greengrass keeps the action percolating along, maintaining a high level of suspense throughout.  He uses a handheld camera to convey the desperation of Bourne's plight and the fragmentation of his mind, often showing us incidents and events from the character's own point of view intercut with subliminal snatches of disconnected memories.  In addition, the lively, hurly burly editing keeps the picture constantly moving forward.  Personally, I could have done with fewer car chase scenes towards the end, since I have always found characters interacting to be more compelling than automobiles interacting, but I suppose that, when it comes to action film audiences, the beast must inevitably be fed.  On the positive side, John Powell has composed a dramatic musical score that really knows how to gin up the tension at crucial moments.<br /><br />As an actor, Damon combines the seemingly paradoxical elements of strength and vulnerability necessary to make his character believable and touching.  In Bourne, he seems to have found his perfect role.</p></br><a href="../users/ASIA7V7CBSKD3.html">ASIA7V7CBSKD3</a><br/><p>After seeing the Bourne Identity I had such high hopes for the sequel and they crashed and burned upon seeing it.

I expected even better sequel. Sad to say. Not even so. First of all, Marie was killed after being shot accidentally while the intended victim was Bourne. Which quite frankly I didn't understand since. In the Bourne novels she is very much alive. But the sequel failed to explain how Bourne came to be. The plot in the movie had so many unexplained answers to questions that need answering. That it was more actionfest than movie. Keep Bourne Identity in your library not Supremacy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>You can tell 'Bourne Identity' was a sleeper hit just by looking at the scope of 'Bourne Sumpremacy' - India, Moscow, New York, Berlin and other locales - in particular, huge, costly, shut-down-the-streets production pieces in Berlin and Moscow.  And, there's no doubt it makes for a riveting two hours of cinema.<br /><br />I've seen reviews that say 'surpasses the original.'  I'm not sure of that.  I liked the cleaner storyline of the original, plus more of Chris Cooper and (especially) the wonderful Franka Potente.  Furthermore, the original was such a pleasant surprise - like most people, I went on a whim with no expectations and was really taken in by Dougie Liman's direction and the raw intensity of Matt Damon's performance.  [Mr. Damon's internal gyroscope - the one that sniffs out good roles in well-made films - continues to function flawlessly. Erstwhile buddy Ben Affleck ought to be taking notes.]<br /><br />Two comments here about the Russian antagonists in the film:<br /><br />- In the book, this is a Cold War confrontation, government-to-government.  In its film incarnation, in order to have present day significance, screenwriter Tony Gilroy had to do a major overhaul to make it more of a quasi-corporate skirmish with an ear skillfully tuned to modern-day Russian Oligarchism.  My compliments - it's a masterful job turned in by Mr. Gilroy.<br /><br />- I couldn't help but stifle a laugh at 'Gretkov,' Karel Roden's oligarch-like character.  He's got it nailed, from his Khordokovsky-like wireless-rimmed glasses to his Abramovich-like perfectly coiffed four-day or so stubble.  Bravo, Mr. Roden.  You've done your homework well.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UNMXBJSVIXFB.html">A2UNMXBJSVIXFB</a><br/><p>Movie - 5.0<br /><br />As I said in my review of the first film, I stand by the belief that the Bourne franchise has ultimately changed the face of spy-thriller movies forever. Sure, the occasional flashy James Bond flick was fun to watch, but there's only so much style you can take after a while till it becomes a bit redundant. Thankfully, these Bourne films were so successful that they were able to re-imagine Agent 007 in a different light, a dark, grittier one that you can clearly see in their current films since Daniel Craig took over the title. But that's beside the point. The point is that I'm really, really thankful because if Doug Liman and Paul Greengrass never directed these, who knows what kind of mediocrity we'd be having to put up with instead. The Bourne Supremacy opens up 2 years after the end of Identity. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and Marie (Franka Potente) are living in Goa supposedly out of the grasp of anyone looking to find them. Bourne has recently begun having nightmares about a man and woman he once assassinated, but still can't manage to piece together anything else relevant between that and his past days in Treadstone. Meanwhile, an operation in Berlin to uncover a mole amongst the top CIA brass, led by Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), goes south when a Russian federal agent, Kirill (Karl Urban), infiltrates the deal and takes out the informant while leaving a fingerprint of Bourne to cover his tracks. Then in an attempt to put Bourne out of the picture, Marie is killed in his stead. Grieved and angered by the loss, Bourne sets out to find those responsible. However, in his pursuit of vengeance, he would discover things about his past that would change him for the better. The Bourne Identity was a refreshing breath of fresh air showing us a man who, at one point, was a cold-blooded killer doing his duty, but upon certain events had a change of heart. A major reason for that was because of a woman he met, a woman that stayed with him and showed him the side of life he had been missing out on. Upon losing her, this man would once again fall into the web of coverups, deception, and lies in search of truth, retribution, and eventual redemption. As if Identity didn't establish the humanity within Bourne enough, Supremacy takes that aspect even further by provoking an act of pure, motivated revenge, that otherwise evolves into a search for inner peace and a realization of humility. With this being the first of director Paul Greengrass' installments, the pacing of both the plot and action are doubly intensified. In addition, the cinematography, fight and stunt choreography, music, and production easily surpass its predecessor. The camera cuts are as quick and vicious as Bourne's ability to take people out, the fights more brutal, the chases more adrenaline-pumping, the music more pulsating, and best of all, the story more symbolic. This definitely takes care of the emotional side of the story arc, and even then, the final part of trilogy will manage to surpass that. Keep going, you're almost done.<br /><br />Video - 5.0<br /><br />- Video codec: VC-1<br />- Video resolution: 1080p<br />- Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />Same director of photography, different director for the movie. The result: an amazing and visceral image compared to the first one! Paul Greengrass did a superb job not only propelling the franchise to new heights with the story, but also with the aesthetic presentation. Black levels are very deep (maybe a little too deep for some) making that sense of mystery and intrigue established in Identity that much more mysterious and intriguing. Even as hot and bright as the colors are in the Goa scenes, the blacks and more balanced contrast give the overall image so much more definition. The colors, by the way, are quite bold this time around. Goa alone has an exuberant amount of reds, oranges, and browns that make you feel like you're in the heat with Bourne and Marie. And even with a very fine layer of grain, detail and sharpness remain intact. Just look a the sweat running down the characters' faces, the texturing in the trees, ground objects, and street markets. And only a fraction of the movie even takes place here. The journey to Berlin is considerably darker, with a lot of the backdrops having more opaque set pieces, more interior shots (with small rooms and such), and a few more scenes shot at nighttime. The black levels are amazing here, but there's surprisingly a sparse amount of noise and grain to get in the way. And finally, the last part of the film in Moscow has a lot of color differentiation. The car chase sequence displays excellent detail in terms of line delineation and object clarity, especially when things start crashing and parts, glass, and other debris go flying around the street. My favorite shots for reference are the scene in Goa when Kirill is standing on the beach looking for Bourne (lots of color), the scene in Munich when Bourne pays a visit to the sole remaining Treadstone agent (lots of grain, but also lots of detail considering how close up the shots are), and finally the car chase in the Moscow tunnel (a little dim, but not super-dark, and again, lots of grain and detail). Some people may think the grain is a bit excessive, but I love the filmic texture it adds. And because of that I can't find any fault in the video.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Languages<br />- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />- French: DTS 5.1<br />- Spanish: DTS 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles<br />- English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />In conjunction with the newer cinematography, the sound is also vastly improved. While the quality in Identity was pretty top-notch itself, there weren't enough moments for it to truly shine. The design and mixing in Supremacy, however, is quite aggressive. The biggest upgrade I noticed immediately is the general immersion. Scenes like the bustling streets of Goa or the protest rally at Alexanderplatz offer all kinds of separation and directionality. You can hear individual vehicles making noise, people talking, the change in volume when objects are in the way, the transference of sounds when the camera pans or cuts to a different angle, and these aren't even the real action sequences. Stuff like the foot chase in Berlin and the car chase in Moscow offer even more sonic perfection in terms of subtlety, dynamic range, and overall buoyancy. My favorite aspects of the audio, though, are its isolation, and the way the music is used. Particularly, I really love the scene where Bourne fights the last Treadstone agent. There's absolutely no music here, and the fight itself is contained in this small little area where you can hear every punch, shuffle, footstep, knife swipe, and paper slap without a single exterior source to disturb it. I personally think this is the most intense scene of the entire film, and a lot of it has to do with the sound, or lack thereof. And then there's the music. The more I keep listening to the score and sampling all the various parts of the movie for reference, the more I'm starting to like John Powell. As a composer, he really lets loose here with the strings and drums. The level at which the music is played is as subtle as the movie's sound effects, and when the pieces actually are played, it really puts you in the scene. LFEs are especially pounding, as the score pulsates and propels the action. Meanwhile, the car chase is probably the other big sequence to pay attention to. The cars running into each other and crashing offer up some pretty good rumbles that, if you have a decent sound system, should provide plenty of room-shaking bass. And yes, like the story itself, the sound gets even better in Ultimatum.<br /><br />Extras - 4.5<br /><br />- Audio Commentary (Director Paul Greengrass)<br />This is a much different commentary than what Doug Liman gave for Identity. While Liman talked a lot about the technical aspects of the filming, Greengrass goes very in-depth about the writing and how he wanted to present certain themes/ideas through the action, especially in the way it was shot. A lot of people complain about the shaky camerawork and quick editing, but Greengrass repeatedly emphasizes how he wanted to keep it "real" (which is also presented as a short featurette on its own in the special features). In allowing the cameras to be handheld and literally follow Bourne's character in everything he does, its intent is to put the audience with him, as well as give the film a more gritty feel. He constantly breaks down key moments of the film as they unfold and goes on to talk about the actors, namely, why he cast them, what he liked about them, and how their personalities reflected well in their characters. There were a few more dead spots in this commentary than there were with Liman's, but it's just as informative and worth a listen.<br /><br />- Explosive Deleted Scenes (SD; 10:46)<br />Not much to say about them.<br /><br />- Matching Identities: Casting (SD; 5:23)<br />Talks about the casting. Greengrass starts off by giving Damon high praise for his ability to play both sides of Bourne so well (the tortured soul, and the ruthless killer). He also says he liked the choice of Allen to play Landy, as he thinks she's quite classy, much like Chris Cooper was for his role in Identity. He then goes on to talk about the film not having one bad guy, but that they were all part of a bad system (which will become very important for the third film).<br /><br />- Keeping it Real (SD; 4:58)<br />Talks about the process of selecting Greengrass to become the new director of the franchise. He says he wanted to portray a truthfulness and realism, which shows through the shaky-camera cinematography. He also makes the point of not wanting the actors to think too much so that their movements are more instinctual and intense.<br /><br />- Blowing Things Up (SD; 4:00)<br />Shows how they blew up the house in Munich and how they didn't us any CG because they wanted more realism to it. Interestingly enough, they got the whole shot in just one take.<br /><br />- On the Move with Jason Bourne (SD; 4:45)<br />Takes a look at the scouting and talks about how they wanted to film the real places in Europe for the film. Berlin was chosen for its historical relevance and as an homage to old spy stories. Moscow was chosen because the city itself has never really been used for movies and because Greengrass felt it gave off a vibe of truthfulness. And then Goa was chosen because it reflected the exuberance and restlessness represented in Bourne's character at that moment in the film.<br /><br />- Bourne to be Wild: Fight Training (SD; 4:21)<br />Shows us the staging for the fight between Bourne and the last remaining Treadstone agent. Fight coordinator Jeff Imada goes over the basic concept of the Kali style used, Greengrass points out how he wanted to really use Venetian blinds for the aesthetic of the scene and that he wanted the fight too look sloppy and raw, yet structured at the same time.<br /><br />- Crash Cam: Racing Through the Streets of Moscow (SD; 5:58)<br />Shows us how the riveting car chase sequence was filmed. They wanted this to be better than the one in Identity by putting a sense of desperation in Bourne to get to his destination, and they did so by making all the cameras either loose or handheld and putting them either in the car or very close to the windows.<br /><br />- The Go-Mobile Revs Up the Action (SD; 6:49)<br />Talks about the Go-Mobile, a camera rig that essentially attaches itself to the front end of a vehicle to put an actor right in the action of a car-driving sequence. They say it's built to be safe (with a very low center of gravity so it never tips over) and that it allows for a lot of different camera angles you wouldn't normally be able to get.<br /><br />- Anatomy of a Scene: The Explosive Bridge Chase Scene (SD; 4:40)<br />A look at how the foot chase in Berlin was filmed. Damon says shooting it was safe and fun.<br /><br />- Scoring with John Powell (SD; 4:46)<br />I love when we can actually take a look at the scoring of a film, especially here because I feel the music in the Bourne series is such an important driving force. Powell says he doesn't conduct, but likes to offer a lot of input during the process. He also says the score itself re-uses a lot of the themes from the first film, but that the new one created for Goa is meant to represent Marie and that it follows Bourne around till the end of the movie. Specifically, it's a theme that plays during her funeral scene, then comes full circle to symbolize his eventual atonement.<br /><br />- The Bourne Mastermind (Part 2) (SD; 4:42)<br />More rehashed interviews with Ludlum that you might have already seen if you watched the ones on Identity. There's a little more additional retrospect here, but not much else.<br /><br />- The Bourne Diagnosis (Part 2) (SD; 5:39)<br />Gives us a little more psychological analysis on Bourne, most notably how his flashbacks are tormenting him and how Marie represents his humanity and the choice of living. And upon her death, his quest for revenge sets Bourne on a journey to find his past and some eventual answers to what's been troubling him.<br /><br />- U-Control<br />More interactive PiP applications that play during the film:<br /><br />- The Bourne Dossier<br />Same as the Treadstone Files option in Identity. It's just a bunch of statistics and factoids in the form of a gimmicky spy computer thingy for people, places, and certain situations. It's cool if you like trivia, but like I said, it's a bit of a novelty, if anything else.<br /><br />- Bourne Orientation<br />Recaps of important plot points, though not in the sense of interviews like the actual PiP commentary. It's a bit redundant and totally okay to skip it.<br /><br />- Picture in Picture<br />The real meat of the extras. It's actually quite humorous at the beginning when producer Frank Marshall says that the feature was made exclusively for "this HD-DVD," which obviously is a dead format now, but after that it's pure gold in terms of information. The PiP takes most of the footage from the other special features listed above. However, it also includes a very large amount of interviews and footage not included in said extras and is full of crucial commentary and analysis of the story itself, as well as a few anecdotes from cast and crew. Most of the feature has the actors breaking down their characters and talking about what it was like working with one another. I was very glad to hear interpretations from Brian Cox and Karl Urban, who play antagonists, but really don't get a whole lot of screen time in general to fully develop themselves. So to hear them talking about how the characters fit into the plot and what they thought about their roles was very interesting. This is by far the best special feature on this disc, and I wholly recommend you make it a mandatory watch if you're interested in the production of the film itself and its literary composition. And unlike the PiP in Identity, this one actually runs for the entire length of the movie, as opposed to 3-5 minute chunks for 8 chapters.<br /><br />Overall - 5.0<br /><br />While the franchise is changing directors at this point, the plot still continues to thicken. I find it to be an interesting take on the character of Jason Bourne. And to further iterate, I really, really thank the people involved because without the Bourne movie franchise, James Bond wouldn't have followed suit, and I don't think I would love the Daniel Craig movies as much as I do today. In the meantime, Universal presents Supremacy with some demo-worthy A/V specs and a deceptively informative set of extras. Do yourself a favor and get ready for a spy-thriller with a lot of heart, then prepare for an even more thrilling adventure in the final act, Ultimatum.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>A good second movie but just lacked the umph of the first movie. I always hate it when they kill off a MAIN character. If they hadn't gotten rid of her then might have given it one more star. THe excitement is still there and the story line is still good.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Where last we left Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), he was living in a secluded location with his new girlfriend.  The Bourne Supremacy picks up where the Bourne Identity left off: Jason Bourne is a professional killer, a member of the Treadstone Group, who no longer remembers his identity. It turns out that Bourne is a perfect scapegoat for another murder, and it's not long before an assassination is pinned on him.<br /><br />And that's the awkward thing about this installment in the Bourne series.  Bourne's reason for involvement in the plot is basically summed up as "it seemed like a good idea at the time."  Fortunately, Bourne slowly unearths information about his own past amidst the machinations of FBI, European assassins, and the Treadstone Group. Unfortunately, professional "bad guy" character actors play the bad guys.  I guessed the twist upon his appearance.  Hint: look for the slimy political type who has no reason to go along on the mission but gets told to do so anyway.<br /><br />There are other problems: one of my pet peeves, the blurry memory cam. Bourne's done some very bad things in his past missions, the missions he supposedly can't remember, and the director decided to tell us by having Bourne remember through echoing, blurry shots.  They get old, fast.<br /><br />The trademark gritty fighting scenes are all here, including insane car chases (more like a series of car crashes), the clever turnabouts that you never see in other spy movies, and plenty of fisticuffs.  Bourne Supremacy doesn't do everything right, but it has street-level action down perfectly.<br /><br />By the end of the film we learn Bourne's full name.  But that's a cop out: the Supremacy is more about Bourne proving that in the past he was never a very nice guy.  That's hardly news.<br /><br />Bourne Supremacy feels more like an episode in a series than a movie.  Bourne fans won't be disappointed, but the rest of us will have to wait until the third installment comes out on DVD to see Bourne develop beyond an amnesiac killing machine.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Paul Greengrass<br /><br />Cast:  Matt Damon, Franka Potente, Brian Cox, Julia Stiles, Karl Urban, Gabriel Mann, Joan Allen, Marton Csokas, Tom Gallop, John Bedford Lloyd.<br /><br />Running Time:  109 minutes<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for violence and intense action, and for brief language.<br /><br />Unearthing decent spy movies in this post-cold war epoch often resemble a wild goose chase, with true gems few and far between. The "Bourne" franchise came to us back in 2002, vying for attention against the tepid likes of a re-incarnated Jack Ryan in "The Sum of All Fears". Starring Matt Damon, Bourne won hands down with its enjoyable romp of cross-European, high-tech escapades. Combining a reasonably gripping story with sufficient quotas of CGI-free excitement, "The Bourne Identity" filled a long deserted niche for many film buffs, and while it didn't exactly conjure the good old KGB vs. Everybody days, it nonetheless heralded a comeback for previously prominent big screen values.  In the first "Bourne" foray, Damon played super agent Jason Bourne, suffering from amnesia and struggling to find out who the hell operated him in the first place. Amid several well-crafted action segments and car chases, the movie depicted Bourne's stand against a shadowy covert conspiracy bent on keeping hidden from prying eyes and vindictive ex-operatives with too much time and gadgets on their hands. The sequel begins more or less where the first chapter left off. A liberated Bourne and his prequel-originated love interest Marie (Franke Potente) elope to exotic Goa beaches in India, eking out a bucolic existence there away from hapless intelligence agencies and brainwashed assassins.  But idyllic conditions like those were never meant to last, and Bourne's infamy soon catches up with him, at Marie's grisly expense. Turns out a new secret agenda has risen to the fore, threatening to entangle our reluctant master spy. A pissed off Bourne therefore ventures to locate those responsible for Marie buying the farm, as well as clear his own name.<br /><br />While just as thrilling as its senior, "The Bourne Supremacy" reveals a major flaw even in the moniker given it: Matt Damon's indefatigable protagonist simply has too many moves, abilities, and lives for his own good. Believability aside, at some point the agent's uncanny expertise begins to grate, not gelling at all with his supposed cluelessness and so-called desperate situation. Would you be desperate if you had a seemingly endless supply of cash of every denomination, nine passports, and ready made weapons that materialize out of thin air?  To fluff up "Supremacy"s plot and distinguish it from "Identity", the newer flick features increased complexity and multiple conflicts in need of resolution, thus paving the way for additional episodes, should the need be felt. Bourne presently faces ghosts harking back to his former employers, Treadstone, plus a few new ones courtesy of that by-now obligatory action movie stalwart, the Russian mafia. The ever-menacing Brian Cox ("The Ring", "X2", "Troy") returns as a suspiciously uncooperative would-be ally, tagging along for the ride while CIA chief Landry (Joan Allen) tries to organize a legitimate search for the missing renegade professional. Karl Urban ("The Chronicles of Riddick", "The Lord of the Rings") adds intimidation via a calculating Russian hit-man, and Julia Stiles contributes selected pouty facial expressions, minimally augmenting Supremacy's lineage and ties to its cinematic forebear.  But all of these characters can't mask the movie's slightly more-of-the-same feel. Despite an astonishingly accomplished car chase through Moscow in a puzzlingly sturdy old taxi, impressive shots of Berlin and pervasively consistent levels of suspense, overall impressions lead us to conclude "Supremacy" fails to surpass the first outing, resulting in superfluous baggage of the infuriatingly addictive variety. Expectations for whatever comes next in the action series, presumably Ludlum's Bourne "Ultimatum", should be kept to moderate thresholds of feasibility. Do not anticipate something bombastic or marvelously ground-breaking, but certainly look forward to more capable antics from the indestructible Damon and his box office panache.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>You don't need to have seen the Bourne Identity to appreciate this slick, action-packed sequel. The Bourne Supremacy stands on its own as a pretty good, self-contained espionage thriller. There are some real improvements in this episode - the pacing is faster, the action sequences are more frenetic, and the ending is stronger and much more credible.  The Bourne Supremacy continues the adventures of amnesiac assassin Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) as he tries to elude, and outthink a rather disorganized CIA, who created him and now want him dead.<br /><br />The disenchanted Jason Bourne is living in Goa, India with girlfriend, Maria (Franka Potente), but he is plagued by violent nightmares of a double assassination, and he is troubled by the role he might have played in it.  Meanwhile in Berlin, the CIA led by Pamela Landry (Joan Allen), is participating in some sort if sting operation, that is designed to net a mole. However, things go terribly wrong when the mole is killed, and a Russian petroleum oligarch frames Bourne for the murder-robbery. With Bourne suddenly reappearing, his old agency, led by Landry and the duplicitous Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) launch an intercontinental manhunt to hunt Bourne down. Bourne, always one step ahead of his adversaries, launches a one-man counter attack against his enemies.<br /><br />Bourne can never be sure who the enemy is, as the CIA and the Russian secret service are both out to get him, and not only is Bourne's memory fractured, but certain members of the CIA are surreptitiously working undercover with the corrupt Russian oil oligarchs to bring Bourne down. Bourne's old medical officer Nicky, (the beautiful Julia Stiles) and sympathetic agent Danny Zorn (Gabriel Mann), both make return appearances, and provide a link to the first movie.<br /><br />The film is somewhat overly plotted and the back-story convoluted, so at times, it's hard to figure out actually what is going on, and what relation some of the minor key players have to the story. But the overall direction of the film is so good and Matt Damon's performance so strong that the film races along with a realistically sustained tension and atmosphere. Towards the end of the movie the handheld camera work, which at first, gives the action a jittery immediacy, does become a little tiresome, particularly during a ferocious high-speed pursuit through Moscow.<br /><br />Matt Damon is made to play Jason Bourne; this is easily his best performance in years, and his hunky, boyish, sexiness brings an understated introspectiveness along with a real emotional vulnerability to the role. The supporting players are also strong: Julia Styles brings intelligence and susceptibility, while Joan Allan is deeply cautious, focused and watchful. So much of the action takes place in Europe and Russia, that the viewer will be dazzled by the different locales. The Bourne Supremacy is a good, strong, espionage thriller, that will leave you waiting in anticipation for the next installment where Jason Bourne will continue his quest for his lost identity.

Very loosely based on a Robert Ludlum novel, "The Bourne Supremacy" does that, with a breathless stream of action sequences featuring the amnesiac but lethal former CIA assassin Jason Bourne (again played with a pitch-perfect combination of restraint and intensity by Matt Damon).<br /><br />As the movie opens, Bourne is hiding in a seaside village in India with his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente from the first movie).  He suffers from flashbacks of which he can make no sense, but he and Marie have built a life together.<br /><br />Four thousand miles away in Berlin, a CIA black operation supervised by CIA Deputy Director Pam Landy (a cooly precise Joan Allen) goes sideways when a mysterious assassin intervenes.  A fingerprint left behind leads Landy to Jason Bourne's identity.  Landy will mount a major operation to hunt down Bourne, enlisting the aid of TREADSTONE veterans Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) and Nikki Parsons (Julia Stiles) from the first movie.<br /><br />In India, the mysterious assassin from Berlin materializes to hunt Jason Bourne.  He narrowly misses Bourne but kills Marie.  A stoic Bourne returns to Europe on a collision course with the CIA and a shady plot involving a Russian oil magnate and a corrupt CIA insider.  The action will spin from India to Italy to Berlin and finally to Moscow, where a thrilling car chase will bring Bourne face to face with his Russian nemisis.<br /><br />The frantic, grainy, realistic cinematic style of the first movie is duplicated here, building suspense fasther than the viewer can worry about plot holes.  The core of the movie is Bourne's relentless pursuit of his objective, slowed only by his struggle to make sense of flashbacks and the need to bandage the odd wound.  The ending leaves plenty of room for additional sequels.<br /><br />This DVD version contains some interesting extra features about the making of the movie.  "The Bourne Supremacy" is highly recommended as an very entertaining action movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>The pluses outweigh the minuses in "The Bourne Supremacy," which is a good thing because both sides of the scale here are pretty significant. I am not sure if the credit for the pluses goes more to novelist Robert Ludlum for the novel "The Bourne Supremacy" or to Tony Gilroy for the screenplay, but I know that the writing is the best part of this summer 2004 thriller. I have not read any of Ludlum's books, but I know Gilroy did the adaptation of "Dolores Claiborne," so it could be either of them. I also know that the parts of the film that take away from "The Bourne Supremacy" can be laid at the feet of director Paul Greengrass.<br /><br />The one thing we know about a Jason Bourne film, as opposed to a James Bond film, is that somebody is always out to see him dead. Bond as least has a mission that has people trying to kill him; Bourne is on a hit list just by breathing. Matt Damon plays Bourne with a understatement that marks him apart from the rest of his secret agent brethren, and which also serves to emphasize the strength of the script. Introduced to the character as a badly wounded body floating in the Mediterranean who did not remember who he was, Bourne survived his first film never finding out his real name, just his identity as Jason Bourne, and dropped off the face of the earth to try and live happily ever after with Marie (Franka Potente), his unwilling ally and now only confidante.<br /><br />Of course, they are doomed, and Bourne goes off to get the people who are trying to get him. This becomes somewhat confusing because the people out to get him on one continent are not same people trying to get him on all the other ones. But the important thing is that Bourne goes off to deliver payback and what is great about this character is his economy of effort. Jason Bourne can create a time bomb in thirty seconds using only three things and in his hands a bottle of vodka has a multitude of uses. Every time he gets into a sticky situation you know he is going to doing something smart and he is going to do it quickly. The intelligence of the character and the script is the strongest part of the movie.<br /><br />But at the same time the script is delighting my brain director Paul Greengrass is trying to turn my stomach. Too much of this film is done by a hand-held camera, rarely to any great effect. Then there are the smash cuts and heavy editing of the fight scenes. What is the good of choreographing a one-on-one fight scene if all we get are quick impressions of what is going on. Then Greengrass starts throwing things together, so that we have hand-held shots of moving people cut at warp speed. This gets a bit disorienting at times and can provoke feelings of queasiness. But Bourne's intelligence overcome these visual liabilities.<br /><br />Bourne is also the smartest person in the film, something it take CIA station chief Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) a while to understand, even though Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) and Nicolette (Julia Stiles) both explain this to her repeatedly. The end game of the film actually has a series of levels, so that it is not a simple thing to get everything resolved, and Bourne does have a hand in everything that happens. There is a strong thread of realism going throughout the impossible situations, but that is why the future of the Bourne series is different from the fate of the Bond flicks. "The Bourne Supremacy" also gets points for the scenes in the movie that we see in the trailer are better in the movie than they are when cut together in the trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/A17D77DFID0GZG.html">A17D77DFID0GZG</a><br/><p>Here we have a sequel with even a better story, yet loses the audience because of the decision to go hand-held through some of the best scenes in the film.  There is nothing wrong with using the hand-held technique (there is a grittiness and realism to hand-held camera work), as long as one doesn't over do it.  A little goes a long, long way, especially on the big screen.  Fortunately, watching the BOURNE SUPREMACY on a TV screen didn't give me the headache I had in the theater.  It's really a shame the director didn't realize this, because overall, he did a heck of a job.  He kept the tension throughout, the fight with the other Treadstone agent was great, and the car chase was spectacular (including the camera angles within the car itself) ... that is ... if we could have actually seen these scenes!<br /><br />The Bourne series has terrific potential, and I really like Matt Damon's presentation of this super agent.  You can see this guy thinking all the time, no matter what mundane task he is doing (walking, talking, eating, etc.).  There seems to be a million things flying inside Bourne's head every minute of the day and it's a pleasure to watch.  It also doesn't hurt that there is something extremely compelling about a man on the run, and it's always been that way (cue in a hundred movies and TV series here, beginning with THE FUGITIVE).<br /><br />So how do I rate this film?  Considering how much I enjoyed THE BOURNE IDENTITY, I'd say that SUPREMACY is actually better, except for the problems stated (that and the fact I was disappointed with an early plot decision concerning Marie).  I would easily have given this a 9 out of 10, or a 5-star rating if not for the camera work.  Still, the story is that good, the acting is very solid, the locations wonderful, and the tension remains strong enough throughout for me to give it 7 out of 10, or 4 stars.  I'm eagerly looking forward to another installment.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>Matt Damon (Gerry, the upcoming Brothers Grimm) returns as  Jason Bourne once again and this time he is being called out of hiding by a new enemy. When his girlfriend, played by Franka Potente (Run Lola Run), gets killed, he takes matters into his own hands and hunts down the people who want him and who are responsible for her death. Twists and excellent action scenes take this one to the max. Paul Greengrass knows how to create a good actioner and yes we all know the books are better but give it a rest will ya, this is a great ride. Joan Allen (The Contender, The Crucible), Brian Cox (Troy, Adaptation), Marton Cskostas (Triple X), Julia Stiles (Down To You, Save The Last Dance) and Karl Urban (The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, Ghost Ship) are among the great cast. Urban plays the evil assassin who killed Damon's woman. Favorite scene would be the last action scene with Damon and Urban in the cool car chase scene. This is one Damon fans wont be dissapointed with. Hey at least he's having a better career then Ben Affleck..anyway I recommend you go see it, it's better then Van Helsing. There's shades of Chris Cooper (Adaptation, Seabiscuit) in this movie</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"The Bourne Supremacy" is the second film based on Robert Ludlum's espionage thrillers about amnesiac CIA assassin Jason Bourne. But unlike its predecessor, "The Bourne Identity", "Supremacy" isn't based on Ludlum's novel that bears its name. At best "The Bourne Supremacy" was vaguely inspired by the novel. It is essentially an original screenplay by Tony Gilroy. This film finds Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) two years after "The Bourne Supremacy" but with no more understanding of his past than when we left him. Still plagued by debilitating headaches, still unable to remember who he was or what he did, and still accompanied by his paramour Marie (Franka Potente), Bourne is living a quiet life "off the grid" in India. Unfortunately for him, someone leaves Bourne's fingerprint behind with 2 murdered CIA agents in Berlin, and an assassin has tracked him to India. CIA agent Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) is intent on bringing Bourne in, believing that he has information crucial to her investigation of stolen CIA money.<br /><br />"The Bourne Supremacy" is a character-driven action film that will find wide appeal. The film has plenty of action -fight sequences, car chases, great stunts- but they're driven by Jason Bourne's desperation, not by a need for spectacle. Bourne is a post-modern, post-Cold War hero: the victim of a corrupt system, forced into action. He's a ruthless but reluctant killer with whom the audience sympathizes, if not actually pities. Director Paul Greengrass chose to film "The Bourne Supremacy" in a gritty, photo-realistic style that keeps the audience in the center of the action and close to Bourne's point of view. On the face of it, this sounds like a good idea. Greengrass took it too far, though, sometimes allowing style to stand in the way of story. Too much of the cinematography is murky, and too much of it is handheld. The camera is dynamic, constantly moving. That's fine, but there is way too much shake. It's annoying and could be pretty unpleasant for those audience members prone to motion sickness. The ideas behind Greengrass' shooting style are appropriate to the film's themes, but the near-constant camera shake makes this big budget action film look amateurish.<br /><br />Like "The Bourne Identity", "The Bourne Supremacy" is elevated by a top-notch cast. Pamela Landy is a one-note character, but Joan Allen assures that she is taken seriously. Veteran Scottish thespian Brian Cox plays senior CIA agent Ward Abbott. Julia Stiles returns in her small role as a CIA agent and former logistics officer. Matt Damon is appealing and sympathetic as Bourne. "The Bourne Supremacy" would have benefitted from a steadier camera, but it's still a thoroughly enjoyable action film. It has suspense, action, real characters, and a great cast.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include deleted scenes, 9 mini documentaries, text "Cast and Filmmakers" bios, a DVD-ROM (Windows only), and an audio commentary by director Paul Greengrass. Peter Greengrass, producers Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, Matt Damon, and stunt co-ordinator Dan Bradley all contribute numerous interviews to the documentaries. "Matching Identities: Casting" (5 minutes) talks about the actors and their roles. In "Keeping It Real" (5 minutes), actors and crew discuss Paul Greengrass' approach to filming. In "Blowing Things Up" (4 minutes) the stunt co-ordinator and the special effects foreman take us through filming the explosion in the house in Munich. "On the Move with Jason Bourne" (5 minutes) is about the film's locations: Berlin, Moscow, and Goa, India. "Bourne to be Wild: Fight Training" (4 minutes) discusses the fight sequence between the 2 remaining Treadstone operatives. "Crash Cam" (6 minutes) is about shooting the car chase sequence in Moscow. This documentary is worthwhile, as the chase employed some unusual methodology. "The Go-Mobile Revs Up the Action" (7 minutes) continues the discussion of filming cars by introducing us to a contraption that allows actors to be filmed at the wheel of a car while moving. "Anatomy of a Scene" (4 1/2 minutes) explores the bridge and barge chase scene in Berlin. Composer John Powell talks about the score in "Scoring the Film with John Powell" (5 minutes). Director Paul Greengrass leaves technical talk to the documentaries. His audio commentary expounds on characters and story, including some insights into Bourne's character. Subtitles are available in Spanish and French, captioning in English. Dubbing is available in Spanish and French.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>In that rare occasion, which actually seems to be happening a lot more, the sequel lives up to the thrill of the first movie.<br /><br />Very rarely do we see movies where the sequel is an honest continuation of the first movie.  Only in movies like the Matrix and Lord of Rings, where we know there will be a third before we even go see the second.<br /><br />In this case, we have an episode in the Jason Bourne character's chronicles.  Living a peaceful life in India, he suddenly realizes he is being chased again.  This is in direct conflict with the agreement he made with his pursuers in the first movie.<br /><br />He wastes no time in showing them that coming after him is a huge mistake.  Plots twists abound as he uncovers the reason someone is suddenly trying to kill him again.  The action is intense, the story moves fast and we always left guessing.<br /><br />There isn't a lot to do as far as intense acting goes, but all actors make the most of what they have.  Brian Cox is always good and he is no different here.  Joan Allen, also reliable in all roles, makes a strong and commanding presence as the woman determined to find out more about Bourne.  Damon is great, always with a look of determination mixed with a bit of confusion.<br /><br />This is a great spy/action thriller with great performances and enough action to leave you exhausted.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A51IK68MWKV5R.html">A51IK68MWKV5R</a><br/><p>Amnesiac Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) just can't seem to get a break. Relocated to India with girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente of Run Lola Run), his idyllic life is broken by yet another assassination attempt (it has to fail or we wouldn't have a movie). Chases and vengeance ensue as the story geographically covers Berlin, Moscow, and Naples.<br /><br />The Bourne Supremacy is the sequel to 2002's The Bourne Identity (from the second novel in the Bourne trilogy by Robert Ludlum; an adaptation of The Bourne Ultimatum will inevitably follow). Bourne is truly a man of mystery: he doesn't even know who he is, only that he once was a paid assassin for the now-defunct Treadstone Project. He thought he was in the clear, but this brings him back out of hiding to defend himself and try to find out why is again a target. On the side of the CIA are Pamela Landy (Joan Allen, in the kind of role she was meant to play), Ward Abbott (the always wonderfully villainous Brian Cox), and, for a short time, the beautiful Julia Stiles as Bourne's former contact in Paris, Nicky (she plays utterly terrified like I've never seen).<br /><br />Director Paul Greengrass (Bloody Sunday) takes over from Bourne Identity's Doug Liman (who stayed on as producer) and gives Supremacy a kinetic style that occasionally veers into the eye-jarring. The use of quick cuts makes chases and fights viscerally exciting, but doesn't allow us to really watch the action. It feels like we're being thrown right along with Bourne, which was probably the idea, but it also makes it seem like the filmmakers are hiding something like their inability to capture a good master shot.<br /><br />The script is mostly a medium for government two-stepping and action set pieces, not that I'm complaining. My favorite involves a crowd scene in Berlin when Damon meets up with Stiles as the agency tries to keep them in their sights so they can kill him. A group of protesters, a slow-moving tram, and Bourne's ingenuity contrive to foil their efforts and Stiles gets her aforementioned terror scene in a side room in the subway. The combination of sound, visuals, editing, and the acting of Damon and Stiles offer quite a lot in the way of entertainment. The film is obviously left open for a sequel (after all, there is a third book to film) but ends on a high note as Landy gives Jason his real name and birth date.<br /><br />I don't usually get into this kind of spy thriller, but Damon's engaging persona makes Jason Bourne instantly likable and the terrific cast is a joy to watch in their various roles. The most interesting part, though, is watching as Bourne begins to remember details about his past work. He attempts to make the amends he can and then moves on to the next chase, as the agency is always just a half-step behind him. The music accompanying all this is somewhat reminiscent of the aforementioned Run Lola Run soundtrack, with the closer from Moby being a particular standout. All in all, The Bourne Supremacy is a popcorn movie of the highest order. Just make sure to get a big enough soda to wash down all that compulsively-shoveled-in treat.</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>&quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; starts well and pretty much doesn't stop racing for two hours.

Franka Potente and Julia Stiles also make good impressions in this film, though they're both only in it for about five minutes.<br /><br /> The action sequences are pretty high-octane, however much of the camera work and split-second editing function to only give you a vague idea of what's happening onscreen, and I don't know if I could explain the complicated plot that leads to Bourne coming out of hiding.<br /><br /> Still, I &quot;got&quot; the film enough while I was watching it to enjoy the ride.</p></br><a href="../users/AUGABW5AS2OXM.html">AUGABW5AS2OXM</a><br/><p>This was an excellent followup to the &quot;Bourne Identity&quot;.The<br /><br /> hero of the series,Jason Bourne,is set up to make it look like<br /><br /> he committed a double murder.He then becomes wanted dead or alive<br /><br /> by the CIA.An assassin tries to kill Bourne but misses.He thinks<br /><br /> it is the CIA and comes out of retirement.He is pursued by the<br /><br /> leader of the Task Force well played by Joan Allen.After he<br /><br /> follows up on leads he unravels a huge conspiracy involving some<br /><br /> members of the CIA as well as the Russian Mafia.His search for the truth takes him to Berlin and finally to Russia.In Russia<br /><br /> you will see a spectacular high speed chase.The movie ends leaving room for a sequel.This is an outstanding movie that you<br /><br /> will enjoy watching.

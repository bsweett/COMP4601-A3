The people of Johannesburg desperately try to contain the aliens by using holding centers for the tame ones, and lots of heavy artillery for the more aggressive aliens, but of course, the aliens are reluctant to do what the people want, and of course, the aliens are there in the first place because they're on a mission.  Hey, you didn't really think the aliens would arrive on earth because they wanted to take a vacation did you?  A happy place to go just to get away from all the hectic everyday universe activity?  Yeah, haha.<br /><br />Anyway, it was a VERY pleasant twist to give viewers an alien movie where they communicate amongst themselves and with the people of earth.  I'm talking lengthy, detailed segments devoted to actual conversations- not just snippets here and there.  A very nice change of pace from the typical alien movies we normally see.<br /><br />Furthermore, the storytelling was never exaggerated to the point of total confusion.  It's easy to grasp the concept because the writing was never once hard to comprehend.<br /><br />Overall, the only negative is that the first 10 minutes are devoted to fictional interviews with people in a lame attempt to try and explain the alien invasions (making it very cheesy and ineffective as far as creating a moving atmosphere is concerned) but other than a slow and somewhat irrelevant start, I was mightily impressed with the quality of the writing, the presentation, the acting and how easy it was to understand the events taking place.  A great movie.  It reminds me of War of the Worlds to an extent (another movie I greatly admire).</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`District 9' is an alien film with a difference. This is shot partly in a documentary style and follows some Aliens (nicknamed Prawns) who come to earth and who are segregated in society and who are kept in slums in Johannesburg. A government department called MNU administer and try to rehome the Prawns and this film explores what happens when one of the MNU team leaders becomes infected with an alien virus. This was slightly a slow starter, but after about twenty minutes this gathered pace and I was kept hooked until the end. The aliens aren't the explicit bad guys we have come to expect from modern films and there is real personality and a softer side to them that comes through, despite their rather unattractive exterior. This had a relatively unknown cast, who all perform well, and although the main character's South African accent can sound slightly like he is from Liverpool at times (especially when he uses the `F` word), this is the only downside to the film. The effects are pretty decent and whilst the film feels kind of low tech at the start (with the jerky documentary style camera work), by the end the effects are fairly good and the explosions and machinery are impressive. There is a lot of talk about the implicit apartheid themes to this film, and I am sure they are there, but you can just as easily watch this for a great sci-fi adventure as well. It has all the elements you would want, alien themed storyline, plenty of explosions and evil government agencies. All in all this is a good film and just over 1 hour and 40 minutes passed by in what felt like no time at all. If you enjoy sci-fi films, with an alternative view of how aliens may react when coming to earth, then check this out; I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/ALLIGF5OZM1I6.html">ALLIGF5OZM1I6</a><br/><p>DISTRICT 9<br /><br />STARRING: Sharlto Copley, Jason Cope, Sylvaine Strike, Nathalie Boltt, John Summer and William Allen Young<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Neill Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Neill Blomkamp<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Science Fiction<br />Release Date: 14 August 2009<br /><br />District 9 would be a bench-mark of success for any filmmaker, let alone a first time writer and director like Neill Blomkamp. It's no surprise his film found its place among the top ten nominated for the Academy Award for best picture.<br /><br />It starts off slow and is shot kind of like a documentary. I'll admit, the beginning of the film could have been done a little better, but it does serve a purpose. It sets up the characters and the film's thick underlying theme; which is prejudice and segregation.<br /><br />We learn that in the 80s, an alien spices landed on Earth. Not in Manhattan or Los Angeles, but in Johannesburg, South Africa.<br /><br />The alien's massive `mother ship' still hovers above the city, years after they landed. The special effects used for this little trick are flawless. Seeing as two of my picks for best special effects didn't receive nominations (2012 and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen), it's between District 9 and Avatar for the Oscar. If you think the spaceship looks cool, just wait till you see the creatures.<br /><br />They reminded me of a cross between The Fly and Predator. Because of this, they are referred to as the slur name `prawns.' After the humans become agitated by their presence (some twenty years later) they put forth an effort to have them sanctioned off, into a lower-status-quo part of town referred to as `District 9'. Should they refuse, they are terminated.<br /><br />Our hero is Wickus, played by a newbie by the name of Sharlto Copley. You can expect to see a lot more of this guy, because he was brilliant. Matter of fact, he's already going to be starring opposite Liam Neeson, Jessica Biel and Bradley Cooper in the upcoming action flick, The A-Team.<br /><br />It's no wonder Sharlto was interested in the material, as he was born a native of Johannesburg. Add on the fact that the film was produced by Peter Jackson, and he seems like a pretty smart dude to me.<br /><br />As the film is filled with intense action sequences and grizzly alien images, I'm sure a great number of its viewers will miss these important political analogies all together. If we are lucky, maybe they'll listen to the audio commentary.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>This flick is extremely imaginative, although I feel obligated to note that its basic theme has a fair amount in common with "Alien Nation." The film is done mostly in documentary form. A huge alien spacecraft comes to rest over Johannesburg, South Africa. Eventually humans board the ship and find about 1 million destitute and starving aliens. Due to their crustacean-looking appearance, they are derogatorily nicknamed "prawns." The film revolves around a scenario in which the South African government seeks to relocate the "prawns" to a reservation in the South African hinterlands, away from the big city.<br /><br />There is not much in the way of characterization in this film.  Part of this is because the aliens themselves are essentially portrayed mostly as ignorant slum-dwellers who mainly only speak their own language. The poor treatment meted out to the aliens is, unfortunately, all too plausible and this is the real point of this film.<br /><br />This one is worth a try for science fiction aficionados and given its limited budget and lack of big-star cast, it is impressive in its own way. RJB.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>An alien vehicle stands over Johannesburg. The Army takes it by assault and so picks up a huge amount of aliens. They decide to confine them into a concentration camp, trying to isolate them from the outer world. But the chosen territory is overcrowded and sordid suburb, where the violence, misery and hunger are everywhere.<br /><br />As the time goes by, this alien community begins to share with this people their way of living and so these aliens become part  of this enormous sector of relegated A horrid environment in which the hopeless is the only certain. The growing tension and the pressure of the public opinion force the Government to find a relative solution: to displace this alien community 200 km. from the city.<br /><br />Wikus van de Merwe is a sympathetic reporter who works out as the commander in chief of the process of dislodging, interviewing the displaced aliens. It's to say the information in plain development. But when he triggers the Pandora's box, the drama will begin for this Government functionary.<br /><br />Nell Blomkamp makes not only an amusing plot with hints black humor, but besides he makes a demolishing critic about the struggling dehumanization, the scandalous process of contamination produced by technological residues and the primitive approach to deal with this curious problem all the way through.<br /><br />Perhaps, the only flaw of the film is the last breadth of sentimentalism that exudes the last sequence of the film which clearly weakness seriously the plot.<br /><br />In sum, more than a smart sci-fi (which pays a deserved homage to "The fly" and a collateral tribute to "Transformers") is an incisive statement about the unaltered human condition.<br /><br />I think to myself if Thomas Hobbes (Leviathan) would be still alive, he would be proud with this release.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AQUVTQFFXP4AC.html">AQUVTQFFXP4AC</a><br/><p>It sounds simplistic, but really, in a situation that was so set up, the movie did spectacularly in focusing on the main plotline while keeping the background story adequately explained without overwhelming the main story. Never is there a point where Wikus Van Der Merwe and someone else bring the movie to a grinding halt with expository narrative like "You know, 20 years ago when this first started..."<br /><br />The trailers gave us what appeared to be a faux-documentary style, involving a modern-day Apartheid... with aliens. That alone would get my butt in a theater seat.<br /><br />Holy hell. In a time period where unique and genuinely great and entertaining movies are a scarcity, this one is a welcome blessing. I hate to do this, but I feel forced to; "Avatar", nearly $300 million dollars to make has some of the best and most realistic CGI ever. And it has a story a 4th grader would find lame and stupid. It's story is not unique, not good, not interesting, full of stale cliche's, total lack of surprises, and a tiresome Human-bashing with a glorification of Na'vi culture that is a near perfect mirror for Native American societies before we extinguished them as the evil creatures we were.<br /><br />This movie, meanwhile, is wholly unique, as much as it can be in a day and age where the audience has seen pretty much everything.<br /><br />The setup is right there: Aliens come to Earth as refugees, and rather than go to the stereotypical places of New York or London or Los Angeles, they end up in... Johannesburg, South Africa. After the initial awe of first contact fades, these aliens are now universally hated among the entire local populace.<br /><br />The story is right in front of it: Wikus Van Der Merwe, set up as a doofy, bright-eyed, largely average and sheepish worker for MNU, the company tasked with caring for these aliens (who are revealed to not be very bright, and thought to be proverbial "worker ants" of a hive-mind society, or else the slaves/lower classes). The movie begins with a documentary which right away foreshadows exactly what will happen, in a brilliant way that neither draws suspicion nor gives anything away.<br /><br />Wikus seems inexplicably villainized by some of the documentary people for reasons you assume to be due to him being MNU, or being stupid, or making enemies or such. Turns out, he's married the daughter of MNU's boss, and thus cries of NEPOTISM can be raised when he's put in charge of a vast eviction of the alien inhabitants of District 9.<br /><br />The eviction scenes are where the movie's only humor comes, easy and naturally, as Wikus and a co-worker, and a genial, fat MNU soldier go hut to hut trying to get the aliens (called "Prawns") to sign them. Rather than show us every single one, they separate some of them with convenient and brilliantly paced and placed bits of exposition, with documentary-style narrative of how the Prawns have existed, how they're treated over the years, how they've committed acts of violence, and how District 9 has attracted gangsters, primarily Nigerian, and how they exploit the Prawn's love of cat food by selling them the stuff in exchange for alien weapons and technology, though this technology is somehow bioengineered to work only for the Prawns.<br /><br />By the time the end of the eviction scenes comes, you're filled in with huge amounts of information, most from these asides, some from Wikus explaining things to his co-worker buddy. The chemistry Sharlto has with the two of them is shockingly good, considering he's never acted before, save for a few seconds in Neil Blomkamp's short film "Alive in Joburg", which District 9 is actually based upon. His natural charm and humor is a welcome relief from even atrocities such as a Prawn ripping off a soldier's arm, then being shot to death, or a hut full of Prawn eggs being exterminated with a flamethrower, while Wikus jokes that their deaths sound like popcorn popping.<br /><br />From there, the movie plot focuses on the next main character, a Prawn given the name "Christopher Johnson", who has a son. It's in CJ's hut that Wikus is exposed to the alien substance that causes him to slowly change into them. This isn't a spoiler, since the trailers for the DVD gave this away.<br /><br />The rest of the movie becomes part action film, part survival, as Wikus is taken in by MNU, subjected to experiments (including weapons testing, as it's found that the alien arm he's grown is capable of using the alien weapons), and the decision is made to vivisect him to study his body and DNA before the transformation makes him fully Prawn.<br /><br />Everything in this film is wonderfully acted, and meticulously written. Nothing is a red herring---not the documentary segments showing some of the Nigerians believing eating alien parts will cure diseases like STDs and Alzheimer's, nor the Prawn selling a mech-walker machine for cat food, nor the seemingly unimportant bit of documentary footage showing a "piece" of the spaceship falling out of it 20 years ago when it first arrived. All of those aspects play a vital part in forwarding the plot.<br /><br />Probably one of the best things about the film is that it doesn't give us a trite, stale, and boring bit of character "development" or sudden shocking change or try to make Wikus perfect for the audience's sensibilities (which is exactly what "Avatar" does).  Wikus is just as racist towards the aliens as the average person. He regularly calls them Prawns, calls them "Fookin' creatures" when accusations are made that he had sex with one of them, he is mean and nasty to some of the Prawns that get unruly or uppity during the eviction, and threatens to take away CJ's son when he throws a lollipop at Wikus's head.<br /><br />Even when Christopher is trying to help him, Wikus remains racist. It isn't until the end that he comes to realize that Christopher is his friend. Even then, we aren't given any "big revelation" moment to show that he's changed. Well... we are, but not in that way! Puns ahoy~!<br /><br />It's violent, gory, has "foul" language, and it will make you cry. It is also one of the best movies of the year, potentially of the decade.<br /><br />And it bears mentioning... Avatar put on a visual spectacle for $300 million that turned out to be a colorful Candyland version of "Dances With Wolves" without any of the compelling drama.<br /><br />District 9 more than exceeds it at literally 1/10th the budget. And while there wasn't as much CG, it bears mentioning that the Prawns are ALL CG, and they look just as realistic as any creature in Avatar---perhaps even more so.<br /><br />DVD/Blu Ray Bonuses:<br /><br />There's more than a dozen deleted scenes. A bunch of them are full-fleshed out scenes from the documentary bits, such as a full version of the aside showing a Nigerian explaining how a piece of alien flesh cures STDs.<br /><br />The best ones are scenes of the eviction, without any CG, showing Jason Cope, who plays Christopher Johnson, standing in for all the Prawns. For the ease of dialogue, he speaks in English, but his intonation and behavior is pure Prawn. And it's just hilarious, seeing him there, physically acting like a Prawn, and saying things that the Prawns say in English. The best one to me was when they caught him stealing televisions.<br /><br />There's much documentaries covering the making of the film and its various aspects, and director commentary which is of great quality of information on the filmmaking and background of it, including background of Johannesburg.<br /><br />Picture quality on the Blu Ray is perfect, as expected.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>Overall, this has been a great movie with an original and unique concept. The plot of the movie has been hashed over in the reviews, so you can read them. Lief Shepphard's review (at this time, at the top of the helpful reviews list and displayed visibly on District 9's page) is a very helpful review, so I will try to not repeat stuff that people already know.<br /><br />What I liked was the starkness of the surroundings - it felt realistic given the location. I can't help but wonder what would have happened if the spaceship stalled above the USA or Europe rather than Africa. The interplay between humans and aliens are also reasonable, with humans profiting off the aliens and offering them services (prostitution, for example) while the aliens try to survive amidst the slums they have been forced to live in. The main character (human) faces an excellent dilemma, and the reactions of the humans around him are very realistic. Overall this is a very thought-provoking film.<br /><br />What I did NOT like was the lack of a backstory. There's no reason for the spaceship stalling, or what Chris (the alien) meant when he was talking to his child (son?) about home. Of course, I don't need some sort of detailed backstory, but it would have been nice if Chris told Wilkus in even just a few sentences what had happened with the ship over two decades ago, where they came from, etc. The ending also hints at a sequel, so if a sequel is made (District 10?) I hope that the backstory will be more touched upon. Overall a decent and thought-provoking film with some great special effects.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>4.2 stars<br /><br />There are many things to love about this movie, especially the genre-bending. I liked how we gain sympathy for the aliens, and how well District 9 was shot. The technology is quite convincing, the characters interesting--especially the well-played lead--and overall I thought this was almost a truly classic film.<br /><br />But, I just couldn't get by the (to me) excessive gore and violence in the early going. It jarred me too much and while it did create some sympathy and antipathy as planned, it also turned me off somewhat. This became clearest towards the middle of the film when we start to really get in the aliens' heads and feel for them, at which point I realized how numb the early gore had made me.<br /><br />Other than that, I thought this was a very intelligent, engrossing movie that transcended its genre nicely at various points. Jackson's involvement clearly brings world-class visual effects and feel, and that's a major plus. The blu-ray version is fine looking, quite realistic indeed. Take away some of the blood and guts and this might be almost Star Wars-quality, and a great movie for kids as well as sci-fi fans. As it stands, it's still excellent, but with caveats.</p></br><a href="../users/ADLVFFE4VBT8.html">ADLVFFE4VBT8</a><br/><p>SOME BACKGROUND<br /><br />Enemy Mine, Alien Nation, The Fly, The Transformers, Independence Day - District 9 is an original movie but, like most original work, it owes some to its precursors. Interestingly, D9 came about because the crew hired to do 'Halo, the Movie' found itself out of work as the project was dropped and, somehow, they were able to direct some of the funding to the making of District 9.<br /><br />THE STORY<br /><br />It all starts when giant spaceship parks itself a few thousand feet above Johannesburg, South Africa and, to everyone's dismay, it turns out to be inhabited by hundreds of thousands of strange looking extraterrestrials in a sorry state who, apparently, lacked the skills to operate or maintain the ship. The alien nation quickly becomes a burden on the South African state who has no choice but show humanity and feed them but keeps them inside a ghetto-like shanty town where crime is rampant and despair is deep. Unable to integrate into the 'human' social structure, the aliens barely survive on international food aid and supplement their income selling technology on the black market and making other shady deals.<br /><br />Enter Wikus Van De Merwe, a ruthless but efficient government bureaucrat in charge with overseeing and containing the alien mess. An accident, literally transforms Wikus into someone capable of seeing the world through the aliens' eyes. And that's what drives the rest of the movie - Wikus slowly increasing empathy and sympathy for the aliens' plight as some of the aliens begin to see him as a friend.<br /><br />District 9 is an exercise in 'what if'. You set the stage in South Africa - and we are somewhat familiar with the country's recent history - you introduce the nearly-helpless, different and needy aliens, you throw some insensitive government bureaucracy and a little international go-goodism and it's 'lights, camera, action'. The special features interviews reveal what quickly comes apparent from watching the movie - a lot of it is improvisation. Directed and written by Neill Blomkamp - his first film, I believe, with Peter Jackson of Lord of the Rings fame as the producer and a number of ambitious actors, the crew often just wings it and more often than not, they manage to produce some interesting or at least exotic-looking interactions. It's not social or apartheid critique they claim but it surely looks that way and having the movie shot on location in Soweto does leave that impression.<br /><br />Overall, it's not a bad sci-fi product but it definitely lacks the polish and the internal consistency that would have turned this good movie into a great movie. It would have helped if the original premise was convincing - but a giant spaceship showing up with a million aliens of which none seemed capable to operate it it's not credible. I would have a lot more to say on the topic but I'd rather not spoil the fun by revealing any more of the plot.<br /><br />BLU-RAY<br /><br />The Blu-ray version does include a few Blu-exclusive features:<br /> - MoviieIQ provides information on various aspects of the movie as the movie plays - pretty nice and it's unobtrusive.<br />- Cinechat would support live chat while watching the movie - not easy to do, would require a lot of coordination.<br />- God of War III demo is included and it can be played on a PS3.<br /><br />Additional feature include:<br />- The always present "Deleted Scenes"<br />- The Alien Agenda: A Filmmaker's Log - we learn many details about the origins and the making of District 9.<br />- Metamorphosis: The Transformation of Wikus - discusses 'makeup'.<br />- A couple more extras of 'the making of'.<br /><br />Notwithstanding the unique Blu special features, I can't say that Blu-ray enhances the viewer's experience in a significant way, probably because, maybe on purpose or maybe because of the low budget, a lot of the movie is supposed to be news footage and most of the shots are not of a high level, 'professional' quality. The same it goes for the sound.<br /><br />MY RATING<br /><br />I will somewhat reluctantly rate District 9 as a 4-star - means "I like it", mostly because I found the idea of "aliens in distress drop on 'second world' or 'third world' country" quite intriguing and because the crew's enthusiasm and energy were able to deliver an overall good product despite some clear budget and time constraints. Hopefully, this is not the last Neill Blomkamp movie.<br /><br />This being a borderline 4-star, I would suggest a rental or pay-per-view to decide whether it's worth actually buying it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>What happens when you take the concept of Apartheid in South Africa, but this time apply it to a stranded group, or should I say stranded colony, of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X768W">BrundleFly-looking</a> aliens? You get a cool rap song called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002Z7F">Sun City</a>! Oh wait, no no no. You get District 9.<br /><br />Little known Writer/Director Neill Blomkamp takes little known Actor Sharlto Copley, and with the help of very well known Producer Peter Jackson, makes a great sci fi movie. I was expecting that deliberate shaky camera work in District 9 (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018QCXGY">Cloverfield</a>) because I had heard that the movie is supposed to be mostly excerpts from a supposed documentary in the making. But that is not the case. Indeed the movie does start out as a kind of documentary. But the shaky camera is a welcome absence. The movie then quickly evolves into a well shot, well acted, thoroughly enjoyable action/sci fi film.<br /><br />Copley plays a bureaucrat tasked with relocating the colony of stranded aliens. This "colony", that's actually more like a slum, is discriminated against and the aliens don't get much better treatment than if they were in a concentration camp. So it is Wikus Van De Merwe (played excellently by Copley) who must politically persuade the aliens to "peacefully" agree to move to a new camping ground. Yeah...good luck. And suddenly when Wikus finds himself the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002KPI1O">Watermelon Man</a>, Wikus' world is turned upside down.<br /><br />Oddly, District 9 got slapped with an R rating by the MPAA. I didn't see much more than PG-13 violence and language in the flick, but my prawn-like skin may be a bit thicker than others.<br /><br />Verdict: Very cool movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>And just when I'm convinced that Science Fiction films are arbitrary garbage, from the phoenix of that garbage, comes out District 9. An absolutely riveting display of the power of the thought. Powerhouse performances.<br /><br />This bought back memories of Children of Men, which remains a fantastic film.<br /><br />Loved District 9.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>It's rare at the moment to see a science fiction movie that isn't a remake, a cash-in, an adaptation, or a spinoff of another big success.<br /><br />But "District 9" is not that kind of movie. Instead, the rarest kind of film -- a unique and original idea, handled in an intelligent manner, with no big name actors or flashy special effects. Director Neill Blomkamp instead creates a truly captivating sci-fi movie -- and by inverting the whole alien-invasion trope, Blomkamp also forces his audience to think. Hard.<br /><br />Almost thirty years ago, an alien ship appeared over South Africa -- but it brought neither global destruction or salvation. When soldiers cut their way in, they found starving refugees who are now nicknamed "prawns."<br /><br />Currently the aliens live as outcasts in District 9 while nations argue over them, and the company Multi-National United is selected to make their weapons work... which is not possible, because only alien DNA can activate them. Then during forced evictions of District 9, a typically callous MNU field operative named Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) accidently sprays himself with a black alien fluid in a little lab. Unfortunately, it starts turning him into one of the aliens.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, the MNU wants the secrets of Wikus' changing body, and the corporation is not terribly picky about how they get it. He manages to escape into the only place where he has a chance of surviving -- the very alien slum that he was trying to empty, District 9. And his only chance of surviving and becoming human again lies with an alien scientist who is trying to reactive the hovering "prawn" mothership.<br /><br />Segregation. Blatant discrimination (including a racist nickname). Poverty. Shanty towns. Large companies and countries who care nothing for the despised minority population. It's painfully clear what would probably happen if spooky insectile aliens were to land on humanity's doorstep -- and Neill Blomkamp pulls no punches in his allegorical examination of apartheid, alien-style -- with the poor "prawns" as the universal victims. It's a hard, gruesome story with painfully graphic violence (Wikus gleefully bombs alien eggs) but it really needs to be that way.<br /><br />Blomkamp also presents his story in a unique way -- much of it is filmed like a documentary, though thankfully it has none of the sickmaking shakiness of movies like "Cloverfield" or "The Blair Witch Project." There are plenty of spliced interviews, documentaries and news footage, which are cloaked in a feeling of gritty, dusty realism -- the dark industrial mothership with its slimy interior, the dusty slum, and the poor aliens who basically scavenge through garbage to survive.<br /><br />But the last quarter of the movie also evolves it into a slam-bang explosion-riddled action flick, without losing its focus -- there are some brilliantly gruesome scenes where the aliens turn against some human attackers, and Wikus even gets to kick butt anime-style in an alien battle-suit. If there's a flaw with this movie, it's the whole idea that humans wouldn't be at all afraid of aliens who are clearly technologically superior to us -- they have a freaking SPACESHIP that's been sitting over Johannesburg for thirty years!<br /><br />It also has the virtue of the most alien aliens seen in ages -- they move, look, speak (click click!) and think nothing like humans, and they're slimy and kinda creepy looking. They have no grandiose plans or pretty sparkly technology. Yet Blomkamp infuses them with a sense of nobility and strength, and despite their insectile faces he makes you feel what they do after awhile.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that this is Sharlto Copley's first acting role, because his performance is so strong: Wikus is a pretty despicable human being, who has fun killing aliens and ejecting them from their homes. It takes a physical transformation into an "other" to change his spirit as well. And Blomkamp lets us see the pain of his transition even when we don't like him (including a heartrending phone call to his wife). The supporting actors also provide excellent lesser performances, but Copley rules this one.<br /><br />As for the single-disc DVD... well, it's pretty skimpy, honestly. It will have a director's commentary by Blomkamp, which is pretty much guaranteed to be awesome -- I would love to see how he conjured the aliens and their hovering ship. There's also the "Koobus Big Gun" featurette, a three part "Filmmaker's Log," and a sequel log called "Refining District 9." The downside: The original short film "Alive in Joburg" that this movie stems from is NOT included. I don't know why -- it's certainly short enough to fit.<br /><br />"District 9" is a brilliantly original, hard-hitting movie that wraps a timeless human failing in an alien skin. It's one of the best movies of the year thus far, and certainly a classic in the making.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>District 9 is art.<br /><br />Spoilers... See the movie before reading about it. The performance of Sharlto Copley as the bureaucrat named Wikus Sharlto is pitch perfect and the entire film was well cast. Great writing and acting here folks. Wilkus is no action hero &agrave; la Tom Cruise or Bruce or take your Hollywood pic. The alien ship, technology and weapons are very convincing. The alien weapons are freakin' awesome. Seriously. As engaging as District 9 is, this ain't no non-stop action flick but when we get to shooting people and blowing stuff up, well I felt very satisfied. The aliens, referred to disdainfully as "pawns" by humans, resemble our crustaceans. They are very, well, "alien". They're physically bizarre looking and speak in a strange "clicking" language. Fortunately people can learn to understand it and the pawns can understand us. These aren't your stereotypical bad guy invader aliens or our angelic Spielberg variety. In fact one of the most interesting aspects of District 9 is the depiction of aliens as very strange creatures surely from out of this world, but at the same time very down-to-earth as well. They are animals like us and have needs (some very comical) and weaknesses and it's fascinating to see the economy developed between human and alien. Some are smarter than others. Doing the film as faux documentary was a brilliant stroke and added a helluva edge. The story mostly unfolds in filthy urban squalor. Distrcit 9 is the name of the camp the aliens are contained in. This science fiction movie is set in Johannesburg, South Africa. Not New York, L.A., Washington D.C. And the setting is crucial to what this highly entertaining sci-fi tale is really about. It's about us of course and it's about what ugly creatures we humans can be. We selfish and fearful humans with our xenophobia and racism and corrupt bureaucracies and greed trumps all morality ethos of the corporate elite and ineffective, corrupt and two-faced governments. There is personal redemption in this story, but when it's all said and done we're left wondering, what next? And I love that.<br /><br />To say some obvious things: Why District 9 is among the best films of 2009 and one of the best science fiction films of all time is because it has the qualities that great films posses. These of course include great direction, excellent script and original story telling, interesting setting, terrific acting, thought provoking social/political commentary, visually striking and highly imaginative sets and effects, good dramatic tension, etc...<br /><br />This movie deserves to be appreciated more and I predict it will be appreciated more in the long-term like so many classic films the public was a tad slow with.</p></br><a href="../users/A153NZD2WZN5S3.html">A153NZD2WZN5S3</a><br/><p>Happened somewhere in Nigeria, this South Africa's mocumentary bears, probably, much deeper meaning for imminent locals watching a story of evicting the ugly-looking sci-tech advanced aliens.<br /><br />What is utterly clear, this work places the SA cinematography on a world map firmly and forever.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>Movies about aliens on earth have been popular going back to the black & white days, so it is really hard to come up with something new and original.  There have been several that were noteworthy.  Maybe the first was the original War of the Worlds, followed by The Day the Earth Stood Still, in which we encounter the god-like aliens who come not to destroy, enslave or uplift mankind, but to discipline us.  Spielberg released the next two milestones.  Close Encounters of the Third Kind was probably the first movie to really explore how individuals, communities, and governments would react to the appearance of UFO's.  E.T. personalized the encounter and put a friendly, if not humanoid face on the otherwordly visitors.  Both movies also featured the most memorable soundtracks of alien movies.  After this, special effects and CGI become widespread and Hollywood is annually producing at least one expensive, though not always profitable, movie about aliens landing on earth.  Examples include Independence Day, Starship Troopers, X-files, Starman, Predator, Superman (remember, he is from Krypton), etc..  However, after E.T., none of them has ever earned a major nomination from the Acadamy Awards until District 9.<br /><br />Produced as an indie film, and set in South Africa of all places, District 9 is probably the best alien invasion movie this decade.  All the norms of alien films are turned upside down; the aliens are technologically advanced, but not advanced enough to keep themselves out a slum.  And instead of having smooth skins with nice uni-color suits; they look like prawns.  And they love catfood.  And instead of coming to Earth as visitors, conquerors or predators, they got stuck here, either lost or as refugees.  This is the backstory of District 9.  The main plot is about a bureaucrat who is accidentally exposed to some sort of biowarfare agent, and begins to transform into an alien.  As this occurs, he is hunted down by humans who want his body for various reasons.<br /><br />This movie is superficially a sci-fi action flick, but it also has scenes of tragedy, comedy, suspense, and drama.  In short, it is a complete movie that explores the human condition in many aspects.  I however did not think it deserved a best picture nomination from the Acadamy Awards as there were too many plot holes in it.  Many of these are highlighted in other reviews for this movie, so I will list the most visible ones.  First of, why isn't the area below the spaceship evacuated?  Second, the aliens clearly own superior technology in terms of military hardware.  Why don't they use this hardware to free themselves from their slum?  Third, how did Wikus and his alien friend, Christopher, manage to escape District 9 and navigate to the MNU corporate headquarters without anyone noticing them?  Fourth, why did Wikus not see a doctor after being exposed to the black liquid.  He knows he is sick, especially after his fingernails start coming of.<br /><br />So overall a good movie, but not a great one.  But as an indie movie, it was probably the best indie movie of 2009.  For its low budget, the special effects, cinematography, set design, costume design, basically everything technical, is spot on and up to par with any big budget Hollywood flick.  This is telling, and highlights how expensive big name actors and actresses are, and how their salaries tend to comprise the biggest chunk of big movie costs.  Worth the watch, and buying this DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PR6NXG0PA3KY.html">A2PR6NXG0PA3KY</a><br/><p>... considering what happened to my review of the film Avatar! A hundred thirty comments, and still coming! But I truly wonder why NOBODY has remarked on the similarity of the two films, Avatar and District 9. Not quite the same script, but mighty close: an alien species is unable to defend itself, for the time being, from Blackwater-style mercenary gunners until one Homo sapiens comes to their aid. In both films, the rescuer is a cross-breed, in Avatar by intent, in District 9 by accident. Both films end up with the half-human and the aliens blasting the baddies (us) to kingdom come. And both films have a profoundly subversive anti-capitalist message. And both films depict humans as unredeemably bloodthirsty racists. Avatar has the edge in pretty scenery and 3-D, but District 9 includes ACTING! A scruffy-looking unknown, Sharlto Copley, plays the role of the DNA-infected 'traitor' to human national and corporate greed; if Copley doesn't win some kind of Oscar for this performance, there's no justice on Earth.<br /><br />By this time, I think it's safe to presume that everybody has seen both films, so I won't offer a synopsis, nor a teaser nor a spoiler. Instead, I want to outrage the usual outragees by speculating on the current mood of apocalyptic fantasy among us H-saps. There are several channels, obviously, one of extraterrestrial encounter, one of global catastrophe (that total snoozer about instant climate change comes to mind), and the third about a Day of Judgement scenario. 2012? I haven't seen it, but it must fit one of these categories. The "Left Behind" novels. What's up, humanity? Are we so desperately fearful of our finite and fleeting existence that we need to bolster our self-image with fantasies of Armageddon? Relax, you silly primates! If there's anyone -- or Anyone -- out there, He, She or They are not preoccupied with us.<br /><br />Is this really a five-star film? Beyond the acting of Copley and the special effects, no way! It's 'kinda dopey' as we say in Minnesota. There are more logical inconsistencies in the script than in a speech by Sarah Palin. And there is a grievous problem with the depiction of the Nigerians in the film; they are stereotyped in the most racist, neo-colonial manner. Somebody ought to be ashamed.<br /><br />But you have to see it, believe me, before the sequel comes out, when the aliens come back. Unless, of course, you think you can take their side ...</p></br><a href="../users/A10DB0H2NZF11E.html">A10DB0H2NZF11E</a><br/><p>We rented this film. We love scifi and thought this was a great movie. It has an unusual twist to it and if you can sit back, relax and not analyze it too much you will enjoy it. It's a little slow in the beginning and the main character is a bit annoying but, it was still a good movie.<br /><br />The special effects were pretty good - 4 out of 5<br />The plot was great - 4 out of 5<br />The Ending was great - 4 out of 5<br />The Acting/Cast was good - 3 out of 5<br /><br />Worth the rental.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>Most obviously, District 9 presents an effects-fest as good as any on the screen these days. The aliens, referred to as "prawns" in a derogatory slur, are clearly not just people in rubber suits - they're built, they move, and they speak in utterly unhuman ways. They also act on unhuman motives, for unhuman reasons. The disaster that leaves them as refugees on Earth appears to have no equivalent in human psychology or biology. Still, they come to life as thinking, feeling, and caring people of a sort. The directorial alchemy that brings these beings to life really drives this movie, by making us want to suspend disbelief while the story plays out.<br /><br />Plenty of hard reality helps carry us along, too. It might be a bit heavy-handed that this parable on racism takes place in the country that institutionalized apartheid. I'll take that as a placeholder, though, one that represents any country that has or has had its own tensions between different groups - in other words, just about anywhere. This creates a cinematic lab in which the many cruelties of forced segregation can be examined.<br /><br />The central character, Wikus, acts as the focus of this study. Cynical leaders set this simple-minded character up as the public face of the atrocities. Wikus, with puppy-like loyalty and eagerness to please, sees only the TV-star glory of the role. He willingly blinds himself to the policies of hatred, even genocide that he emcees for the viewing public. The most wrenching example might be when the relocation forces burn out an alien nursery, and Wikus cheerfully narrates the sounds of their eggs bursting in the flames: "like popcorn, pop-pop-pop!" This ability to dehumanize the subjugated people (alien people, but people) has appeared again and again in the worst chapters of human history, and appears with wrenching vapidity in Wikus.<br /><br />Then, when Wikus finds himself on the other side of the color line, he becomes one of the un-people. He becomes material for sadistic medical experimentation, just one more component to be bolted into the oppressor's war machine. For all this, the movie's creators never forget their duty to the summer-cinema audience. Spectacular effects, bam-pow action, chases, and explosions keep the popcorn crowd happy, at the same time that it satisfies the thinking viewers. This movie's brilliance is that it addresses the viewers who want both.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release</p></br><a href="../users/A9NCQGVV5W8N0.html">A9NCQGVV5W8N0</a><br/><p>Johannesburg, The Present: The Alien ship drifted into a lazy orbit over Johannesburg twenty years ago. When humanity finally cut their way inside, they found roughly one million malnourished, unhealthy insect-like Aliens dwelling within. The Aliens - derogatorily nicknamed "Prawns" - were relocated into a single huge refugee camp in Johannesburg known as "District Nine". Despite an apparent instinctual affinity for technology, the Prawns are generally considered to be of low intelligence and have been marginalised, castigated, brutalised and left to die by a largely intolerant human population which treats them with suspicion, disgust and xenophobia. With Alien/Human tensions running at an all-time high, it is decided that the Prawns should be evicted from District 9, which has degenerated into a gigantic slum of shacks, poverty and crime over twenty years, and relocated to a new district far outside the city.  MNU, a private corporation which has thus far been unable to exploit the fruits of the alien technology, is contracted to enforce the eviction and do so with their usual brutal efficiency not realising that the ruthlessness of their conduct will have devastating consequences for both human and alien alike...<br /><br />As one would expect, the spectre of South Africa's Apartheid years haunt virtually every frame of Neill Blomkamp's "District Nine". If you are old enough to remember the horrors of that era, you can only marvel at the bravery of Blomkamp's film; partially shot in nascent semi-documentary style, I felt an old familiar sickness in my stomach as I watched Afrikaans bureaucrats - backed up by armed bully-boys - cheerfully going about the systematic eviction of oppressed and marginalised 'pariahs' from slum-dwellings whilst throwing jocular asides such as "The Prawn does not really understand the concept of ownership, so evicting him is no great problem, hey?". The poignancy of these scenes is all the more potent when one considers that they were shot on the outskirts of Johannesburg's Soweto township (which witnessed just exactly this kind of state endorsed barbarism during the Apartheid years).<br /><br />That said, there is much more to Neill Blomkamp's film than just polemic. It is a brilliantly paced action thriller, with a very dark comic streak, which puts virtually everything made by Hollywood in recent years to shame. After watching it, I was unsurprised to discover in the extras that this project was green-lit following the collapse of producer Peter Jackson's movie of the "Halo" video game. Indeed, the final sequences of the film - which, despite some awesome action, for my money were the weakest - do actually resemble the action sequences from a particularly bloody first person shooter, so one wonders whether any of the production design was carried over from the aborted film.<br /><br />In terms of acting, performances for the most part are brilliant, convincing and improvisatory. Praise must go to Sharlto Copley for his turn as 'Wikus', an MNU bureaucrat who finds himself reluctantly thrust into the very heart of alien/human tensions. He makes one of the most unusual leading men of recent years (think David Brent from "The Office" cross-pollinated with an action hero and you're getting close). This really is a film which is carried as much as by its acting as its special effects.<br /><br />"District Nine", along with the likes of the similarly brilliant <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002T9H2MO">Moon</a> and "Daybreakers" almost seems to be part of a new renaissance in thoughtful, philosophical independent science fiction film-making (and proof that the smartest movie-making really does seem to be completely removed from Hollywood, these days).</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>It's strange to call a science-fiction thriller eerily captivating, but first-time feature director Neill Blomkamp has somehow managed to earn that description with a most unexpected twist on the alien invasion genre of films. Based on a six-minute short, "Alive in Joburg", he made back in 2005, director/co-screenwriter Neill Blomkamp has fashioned a propulsive, corking adventure film that manages to be a thoughtful allegory on xenophobia, corporate greed, and due to its South African location, apartheid. What is most fascinating about the screenplay co-written by Terri Tatchell is that the aliens are not positioned to the viewer as an unknown force ready to destroy mankind, as is usually the case, but rather as an escalating socio-political "situation" to which the South African government respond by assigning a multinational corporation to transport them from a ramshackle, inner-city shantytown called District 9 to another area outside of Johannesburg.<br /><br />Turning our expectations upside down, Blomkamp reveals an obviously powerful alien species rendered helpless on earth by their refugee status and relegated to criminal acts. In mock-documentary style, the story begins with a series of interviews explaining the back story for the aliens. A gigantic spaceship hovers over Johannesburg in 1982 (shades of Roland Emmerich's 1996 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005V9IK">Independence Day</a>) where an exploratory team discovers over a million malnourished aliens onboard without a leader. They are tall bipeds with insect-like faces and crustacean-like bodies (looking very much like Jeff Goldblum's fully transformed title character in David Cronenberg's 1986 remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X768W">The Fly</a>). Over the next two decades, the aliens conform to their squalid surroundings and engage in destructive behavior that raises the ire of the local residents who call them derogatorily "prawns". An officious Afrikaan field operative named Wikus Van De Merwe has been assigned the unenviable task of serving eviction notices to the aliens and confiscating their weaponry.<br /><br />On one particular raid, Van De Merwe inadvertently sprays himself with a mysterious liquid that mutates his DNA to take on alien characteristics. He is shunted to District 9 where he relies on a more thoughtful alien named Christopher Johnson to help him reverse the transformation process. Before that can happen, the multinational corporation wants Van De Merwe for his new-found ability to handle alien weaponry (which humans cannot operate). There is also trouble brewing with Nigerian gangs eventually leading to a violent melee that decides the fate of not only Van De Merwe but also the aliens on earth. Blomkamp decided to cast a first-time feature actor, Sharlto Copley, as Van De Merwe, and he is quite effective in the role. At first, he appears to be a geeky corporate lackey married to the boss's daughter and intent on carrying forth his undesirable mission with little trepidation. Copley manages to show his character's arc in not only the manifestation of graphic effects but also through the sinking dejection he experiences as an evolving alien.<br /><br />All the aliens are CGI-generated, and kudos belong to the visual effects team headed by Dan Kaufman, Peter Muyzers, Robert Habros, and Matt Aitken for giving them a scarifying look to contrast their increasingly vulnerable state. Make no mistake that despite the film's grander statements regarding the detrimental impact of social segregation, it turns primarily into a man-on-the-run (or should I say "alien-on-the-run") B-style thriller with eye-wincing horror elements. There is a robust set of extras with the two-disc 2010 DVD set. The first disc contains 25 minutes of deleted scenes, a strong making-of documentary, and an engaging commentary track from Blomkamp. The second disc is on the light side, offering four featurettes which detail various aspects of the production, but unfortunately, there is no sign of the original short, "Alive in Joburg".</p></br><a href="../users/AW1493ZQTQ2ET.html">AW1493ZQTQ2ET</a><br/><p>At first, the plot and characters in this movie seem quite bizarre, but it eventually becomes apparent that the movie is clearly and faithfully illustrating a theme which is natural to the human condition.  That theme revolves around what happens when a minority group lives in the midst of a majority group, with the division into different and opposing groups being established based on their differences in ancestry, appearance, language, diet, and other cultural traits.<br /><br />In such a situation, the majority group may grow to detest the minority group and unjustly blame them for many of their own troubles, and they may even be tempted to exterminate the minority group (ie, genocide), but their instincts will usually tell them that that's going too far.  Instead, the minority group will usually be allowed to continue to exist, but they'll be geographically cordoned off and their rights will be limited, so that they suffer deprived circumstances, including epithets, physical abuse, poverty, exploitation, and crime.<br /><br />Again, the movie illustrates this (important) theme well, and in a way that there's no question about who the minority group is and the ways in which they're being mistreated.  I found the movie gripping, and I suspect that I'll remember it for a long time.<br /><br />If I have to come up with a negative criticism of the movie, I would say that perhaps some of the violence is over the top, and I wonder if it was necessary to include Nigerians among the really bad guys (given that their reputation is already bad enough).<br /><br />Nevertheless, I do recommend this movie.  It's much better than I expected, and it does its job well enough to warrant a full 5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>District 9 (Neil Blomkamp, 2009)<br /><br />There is heavy-handed, and then there is District 9, a movie that goes so far over that line it's not even funny. Worse, the second half of the movie devolves into the most predictable buddy-cop flick you've ever seen, despite the fact that neither of the buddies involved is a cop. So given all this, why on Earth did I love this movie as much as I did? Part of it, of course, is the phenomenal effects work (the same reason I get so much enjoyment out of the even stupider Alien vs. Predator), but there's something more to it, and that something is Sharlto Copley, a South African actor making his feature film debut, and who manages to outshine everyone else in this cast.<br /><br />Quick synopsis: aliens came to earth twenty years ago, choosing to land in South Africa, of all places. The government immediately set them up in a section of the city that rapidly became a slum, District 9. The human natives of Johannesburg are restless, and the government has come up with a solution to pacify them: move the aliens, derogatorily known as "prawns", to District 10, two hundred fifty kilometers north of the city, and thus two hundred fifty kilometers farther away from humans. Wikus van de Merwe (Copley), a bungling but likable bureaucrat who happens to the the son-in-law of the director of the company that runs alien affairs, is put in charge of serving eviction notices. Things rapidly get out of hand, due not only to the inherent racism on both sides, but because there really are some things going on in District 9 that the humans should probably have been wary of. At the core of those things is Christopher (no actor; the aliens are entirely CGI), an alien who just wants to repair their spaceship and go back to their home planet. Wikus and Christopher start off in a weird kind of colorless antipathy, but after a horrible accident causes Wikus to be shunned by the human population and smeared in the media, Wikus and Christopher find a need to work together to get what each is looking for.<br /><br />What really makes it work, despite the transparency of everything, is Blomkamp and Tatchell's layers of understanding of innate racism. Underneath the painfully obvious exterior and the reactions of the outright racists is the sort of everyday prejudice rampant in the world today, and often not considered as prejudice. More to the point, the screenwriters don't try to pull their punches at the end and offer some sort of facile new-age "can't we all just get along?" mumbo-jumbo. (Come on, you know that would have happened in America.) Copley is able to pull off everything asked of him, both in this regard and in the wider role of reluctant action hero, and that's a pretty amazing thing for a first-time actor. He brings a fine sense of nuance to the role that really allows us to empathize with Wikus, as much as that empathy might make us feel uncomfortable at times.<br /><br />And the effects! Forget the explosions and big aerial shots of Johannesburg and all that sort of thing and just look at the aliens. Who aren't really there. There's no guy in a rubber suit being augmented by CGI applications here and there; everything you see is CGI. That's an absolute boatload of work, and messing up any single frame could have done the illusion in. Doesn't happen. This is masterful work, certainly the equal of anything done by the top animation studios found in America or Japan, and it's magical. That alone is reason enough to see the movie. (Oh, yeah, and a lot of things blow up.)<br /><br />So, yes, it does have flaws, and it's certainly not the second coming of Star Wars that so many have proclaimed it to be, but is it enjoyable and worth seeing? Without doubt. *** ?</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>District 9 is something that perhaps no one saw coming, and ends up being the absolute best movie of the summer hands down. Produced by Peter Jackson and helmed by Neill Blomkamp (the director Jackson hand picked for the shelved Halo movie), District 9 depicts an alien race that came to Earth on an emergency basis a couple decades before hand, and have since become refugees in a violent slum in Johannesburg. Bureaucrat Wikus (Sharlto Copley) is charged with serving eviction notices to the alien "prawns", and through a mishap, ends up undergoing a horrifying transformation that makes him a wanted man by everyone. As he and a prawn dubbed Christopher Johnson become unlikely allies, things begin to really kick into high gear. Beginning as part mockumentary and part satire on apartheid, District 9 takes its time to become a bloody full-blown action/sci-fi opus that stays with you long after the credits are done rolling. What also helps make District 9 so good is that you truly never know what is going to happen next. The sheer unpredictability of the film helps make it so magnetic, and newcomer Copley manages to be hateable, likable, and sympathetic all at the same time as his character continues to develop and change (literally) as the film goes on. All in all, District 9 is an incredible science fiction film that features equal parts action and heart, and in a bloated summer full of empty blockbusters like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, G.I. Joe, and the like; it is indeed refreshing to see something like this on the big screen. Do yourself a favor, don't miss out on District 9.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>Sometimes the best way to describe a situation is to come at it from the side. Rather than comment directly on what is happening, use an allegory to describe a situation and discuss it. Such is the case with DISTRICT 9.<br /><br />Set in the not too distant future, the story is pieced together at first via news footage and interviews, later on depending on the standard filmed story. An alien spaceship hovers over South Africa, motionless in the air. A team is dispatched to enter the vessel and they discover a breed of alien that seems a cross between an insect and a crawfish.<br /><br />Called prawns due to their bottom feeding nature of scavenging for food, the folks of Johannesburg treat the aliens with a combination of fear and resentment. The story continues as we learn of the aliens settling into an encampment of their own, a shanty town that houses both aliens and a group of Nigerian thugs who trade weapons and run their own crime ring out of District 9.<br /><br />Enter Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley), an employee of MNU (Multi National United).  A Halliburton type group of weapons dealing/mercenary styled executives, they've employ both soldiers and Wikus types, office workers who believe in what their doing with no clue what goes on behind the scenes. Wikus is put in charge of a plan to relocate the "prawns" from the shanty town they're in to a new location built with huts for them all.<br /><br />Going door to door to get their required signatures for the eviction notices, Wikus and his group face everything from attack to verbal confrontation with the "prawns". Unbeknownst to him, one alien is in the midst of formulating fuel to power a shuttlecraft to leave the planet. Wikus confiscates the fuel but accidentally is exposed to it. As the film progresses, Wikus personal DNA begins to alter and he starts to take on the aspects of the aliens, watching as first his hand changes into a claw and moving forward.<br /><br />Of course MNU sees this as an opportunity since the weapons they confiscated from the aliens won't work when held by a human. It seems there is something in the genetic make up of the aliens that causes the weapons to work. Wikus becomes a guinea pig of sorts, used to make the weapons work and kept away from friends and family in a science outpost.<br /><br />Fearing for his life, Wikus escapes and seeks out the alien he encountered with the vial of fuel for help. He discovers what it was that changed him but also the fact that the only fuel left, the only way for him to receive help, is to recapture the fuel container at the research station he was in.<br /><br />Should the pair be successful, Wikus may be able to be changed back, the alien return to his home world with his young son and the "prawns" finally be treated as something other than outcasts. A battle between the mercenaries employed by MNU and Wikus in a souped up mechanical suit add some action to the tale as we wait to find out what the future holds for all involved.<br /><br />The story about the mistreatment of those that are different from us is universal to every country in the world. Perhaps that accounts for the popularity of this film when it was released. As Wikus becomes one of them, he is exposed to their treatment and how they are perceived. By becoming one with them, he learns in the process and his outlook on his life and the world around him changes.<br /><br />As with all great science fiction films, the story is the centerpiece but the surrounding portions add to the whole. The special effects are magnificent, offering us a look at an alien life form that looks as if it is right there, shot on camera without the use of effects. It makes the story all the more believable. And the performances by stars that are relatively unknown in the US make them seem real as well. While grounded in sci-fi, the film makes it seem as if it's taking place now.<br /><br />Slow going at first, we are given a look at a world we think we known inhabited by creatures we do not. It takes a bit of time to learn about them as well as about ourselves. And in the end, the story we witness makes us think a little bit more about how we react to others. At least let's hope that those who see the film do.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OU415LB9I5J6.html">A2OU415LB9I5J6</a><br/><p>After The Lord of the Rings trilogy and King Kong, Peter Jackson was handed the keys to a Halo movie. But work starting on The Lovely Bones (due out December 11, 2009) and the possibility of The Hobbit in his future, Peter Jackson opted to produce and wanted to pass directorial duties to an unknown South African director named Neill Blomkamp. With an unknown director known only for his short films, commercials, and special effects work and a reported $150 million budget for Halo the producers and studio balked at the idea of Blomkamp directing. After Halo fell through, Jackson offered Blomkamp a $30 million budget to direct the film of his choice. The result, a feature length version of Blomkamp's first short film Alive In Joburg called District 9.<br /><br />District 9 starts as a documentary. Thirty years ago an alien ship came to a halt over Johannesburg, South Africa. After emptying the ship of it's inhabitants, the government segregates the aliens from the humans into a dirty third world camp called, you guessed it, District 9. The aliens who looks like a cross between insects and crustaceans and are referred to as prawns are forced to live in squalor and filth in rickety shacks and have to dig through trash for food or trade their advanced weaponry to Nigerian gangs for cans of cat food (their preferred food). Unfortunately, everything in District 9 isn't as it should be as the humans want them moved even further away from society, so a plan goes into effect to move the prawns even further from society into District 10. A group of officials from a government contracted firm called Multi-National United (MNU), led by Wikus Van De Merwe (newcomer Sharlto Copley) is sent into District 9 to give the prawns eviction notices stating that they have 24 hours to vacate District 9. During the course of their project, though, Wikus accidentally has some mysterious liquid sprayed in his face which has some devastating effects.<br /><br />District 9 could quite possibly be the best movie I've seen all summer, my only regret is that it didn't come out sooner. It starts out as social commentary dealing with apartheid, the humans take great pleasure in treating the prawns as less than human, shuffling them around, berating them, and even burning down shacks that contain their eggs. It's this sociopolitical relevance that really causes this movie to rise above it's sci-fi peers. On top of that, the movie is shot with a real documentary feel, this adds to the gritty reality of the movie. You believe this is happening because it feels like a documentary you'd watch on the History channel.<br /><br />On top of that, the acting is superb as well. A special shout out must be given to Sharlto Copley who has no acting experience and had no previous acting experience and had no intention to be an actor prior to Blomkamp's short film, Alive In Joburg. His character Wikus is seen in nearly every scene of the movie and you really feel for him despite his early despicable acts in the movie. You always feel for him and you always root for him, and while that can be attributed to great writing, it takes a great actor to really pull that range off.<br /><br />The real winner in this movie, and what really blew my mind, though, are the special effects. I don't normally mention budgets when reviewing a movie, but here I think it's important. To give you an idea if you were to look at the other action movies to come out this summer you would see that X-Men Origins: Wolverine cost approximately $160 million to make, Terminator Salvation cost about the same, and Transformers 2 cost about $200 million. On the other side of the spectrum, if you look at comedies, Funny People cost $75 million, and last years Zack and Miri Make a Porno cost $25 million. Hell, back in 1991, Terminator 2 was originally budgeted at $77 million but went way over budget. The point: this movie had as many special effects as, say Wolverine, and cost less than a third of that to make and looks 10x better. Remember, all of the prawns, except the dead ones laying out on tables, were shot completely with digital effects and they all look photo-real. This movie easily looks like a $150 million plus movie.<br /><br />All in all, I'm really hoping this movie starts a new trend among studios: more original movies. I highly recommend you check it out in theaters, but before you decide to take your kids remember that this movie does earn it's R rating. It has way more than it's fair share of cursing, and exploding bodies (that alien technology will get ya every time). If you have a chance to go alone, or don't mind your kids seeing gore and hearing multiple f-bombs, I suggest you see it now and not just wait for this movie to hit DVD.<br /><br />5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A2XMBWQL0LGNJD.html">A2XMBWQL0LGNJD</a><br/><p>District 9 makes no apologies for being a straight-forward heavy-handed allegory for South African apartheid, hence the probability of a malfunctioning extraterrestrial mothership that just so happens to appear hovering in the skies over Johannesburg of all places on Earth and marooning a non-human race of aliens which are quickly given the derogatory slur "Prawn" because of their resemblance in appearance to our planet's indigenous crustaceans and are quickly "relocated" from District 9's shantytowns and slums as history begins to inevitably repeat itself. The film starts off as a mockumentary with realistic brilliance and abruptly shifts gears toward a conventional plot-driven science fiction story that recalls sociological themes of racial prejudice explored in past science fiction films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059HAD">Alien Nation</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059HAC">Enemy Mine</a>. There really aren't any likable humans in this film at all, not even the "anti-hero" Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) who comes off as a complete bureaucratic tool only interested in (literally) saving his own skin... and that's really the whole point, isn't it? That from the alien's point-of-view their impression of the human race is one of a predominately vile, greedy, despicably self-serving species whose ulterior motive is profiting from the knowledge and technological "acquisitions" that contact with an advanced alien race might bring us and the consequences when first contact goes horribly awry and Director Neill Blomkamp explores these shameful and seemingly unredemptive human character flaws with profound existential brilliance.<br /><br />The "Prawns" are the most "Alien" looking aliens in cinema this side of H.R. Giger's Alien or Stan Winston's Predator and refreshingly features some of the best use of seamlessly integrated CGI seen in cinema in recent years. The more inhuman they appear only reinforces our irrational fears and anxieties to their seemingly non-hostile intentions and our tendencies towards racial animosity. They communicate to us only through a strange audible clicking sound that constitutes their linguistic structure similar to the native South African Bantu and the apparent semantic language differences, cultural customs and communication barriers rapidly deteriorate any hope for peaceful coexistence between our species. For example, the Prawns don't understand legal jargon like "eviction" making their ignorance to our common laws easy targets for bureaucratic exploitation and authoritarian subjugation.<br /><br />It would be interesting to see if the Prawn who identifies himself only as Christopher Johnson would keep his promise to Wikus. After all the deplorable things we did to his kind though why should he? Perhaps that is what ultimately separates them from us and in spite of his race being atrociously segregated, brutally tortured and inhumanely experimented on comes back in three years to District 10 to free his people and help poor Wikus out of moral sympathy and compassion, universal traits that are seemingly lost upon the native human inhabitants of this planet.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>The action scenes in this film go on for quite some time and are rather frequent. However, one can't help but feel sympathy for both the unfortunate aliens and for the hapless human who gets caught up in matters he never thought he would be involved in.  One can detect many implications and ideas here, from racism and xenophobia to the problems of refugees, to the status that would be given to aliens who are stuck here, to the morality of using them for medical experiments, and much more.  You don't need to be a sci fi fan to understand the deeper meanings of what the filmmakers are getting across.  They also have done a fantastic job with the aliens--their look, their movements, and even their expressions.<br /><br />It's also telling that they set the movie in Johannesburg, South Africa--I don't need to explain why.  Definitely worth a look and may be worth further discussion even in a classroom setting.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>District 9 is something that perhaps no one saw coming, and ends up being the absolute best movie of the summer hands down. Produced by Peter Jackson and helmed by Neill Blomkamp (the director Jackson hand picked for the shelved Halo movie), District 9 depicts an alien race that came to Earth on an emergency basis a couple decades before hand, and have since become refugees in a violent slum in Johannesburg. Bureaucrat Wikus (Sharlto Copley) is charged with serving eviction notices to the alien "prawns", and through a mishap, ends up undergoing a horrifying transformation that makes him a wanted man by everyone. As he and a prawn dubbed Christopher Johnson become unlikely allies, things begin to really kick into high gear. Beginning as part mockumentary and part satire on apartheid, District 9 takes its time to become a bloody full-blown action/sci-fi opus that stays with you long after the credits are done rolling. What also helps make District 9 so good is that you truly never know what is going to happen next. The sheer unpredictability of the film helps make it so magnetic, and newcomer Copley manages to be hateable, likable, and sympathetic all at the same time as his character continues to develop and change (literally) as the film goes on. All in all, District 9 is an incredible science fiction film that features equal parts action and heart, and in a bloated summer full of empty blockbusters like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, G.I. Joe, and the like; it is indeed refreshing to see something like this on the big screen. Do yourself a favor, don't miss out on District 9.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>Neill Blomkamp's ambition to do something different with the timehonored alien contact theme made "District 9" the best science fiction film of the decade. He wanted to make a movie in which aliens visit the developing world instead of a First World metropolis. And he wanted the aliens to be neither conquerors nor enlightened idealists come to set humans on the right path. Blomkamp grew up in South Africa, so he chose Johannesburg. He lived there during the Apartheid years, so he placed the action in Soweto and, with co-writer Teri Tatchell, constructed a plot inspired by the civil unrest that inevitably occurs when the upwardly mobile segments of society must face the violence and destitution that plagues the populations of their slums, townships, favellos, shantytowns, refugee camps, etc. and spills over into middle class lives.<br /><br />Twenty years ago, a spacecraft came to rest over Johannesburg. When months pass with no action, humans force their way inside. What they find is horrific: A million aliens starving, aimless, and apparently unable to operate the craft. The aliens are evacuated to a holding camp, District 9, where they are fed, but it is not clear what should be done with them. Nicknamed "Prawns" due to their crustacean-like appearance, the aliens seem to require leaders in order to function, like an insect colony, and their leadership perished in whatever catastrophe befell the spaceship. Now they are violent, disorganized, and a menace to society. It is determined that the aliens cannot integrate with humans. Their ship won't work, so they can't leave. The private military Multi-National United (MNU) that has been hired to contain the aliens now has the job of evicting them from District 9 to a camp farther removed from the human population.<br /><br />The man in charge of the operation is Wikus van de Merwe (Sharlto Copley), a bureaucrat of little talent who owes his career to his domineering father-in-law, MNU's CEO. As we might expect, the removal of the aliens does not go off without a hitch. It turns out to be an especially big hitch for Wikus van der Merwe. Like all good science fiction, "District 9" is allegory. We might think we recognize the theme right away, but it turns out not to be as simple or clich&eacute;d as it first appeared. That's what makes "District 9" a great movie. Many a Third World Marxist have made films about populations who live on the fringes of society in destitution, unable to put themselves on the road to prosperity, so instead fall victim to cycles of violence. Those films are simplistic to the point of disingenuous. They don't intend to make people think, but simply to scold the bourgeoisie. They're unwatchable.<br /><br />"District 9" is an action movie. It has a lot of sheer entertainment value. That helps. But where it departs from the standard impoverished immigrant population versus middle class xenophobia paradigm is daring: Neill Blomkamp dares to make everyone unlikable. In forcing the audience to sympathize with the characters' situation, not with the characters themselves, "District 9" turns the tables, not just on conventions of filmmaking, but on moral laziness.<br /><br />Wikus van de Merwe is not an Everyman that Harrison Ford or Bruce Willis would play, a man who looks ordinary but takes on superhuman resilience and lofty ideals when faced with adversity. They are what the audience likes to imagine themselves to be. Wikus is a sniveling bureaucrat. He's a nice enough guy. But he's selfish. He couldn't care less about the ethics of his job, as long as he collects a paycheck and goes home to the wife he adores. He's a real Everyman. He's not what the audience wants to be; he's what the audience is. He's not admirable, but he is so real that everyone can understand how he must feel. And everyone can understand that he shouldn't be treated the way he is, even though Wikus would (and does) turn a blind eye to that kind of treatment if someone else were on the receiving end.<br /><br />The Prawns are victims of countless human and civil rights violations. But the human populace has genuine reason to fear them. Whatever they might have been when they had leadership, without it they run riot. They steal; they kill; they don't like humans. They cannot be blamed for disliking humans, but neither could they realistically be integrated into human society. They're not sympathetic. They appear no better than their human oppressors, maybe worse. The alien called "Christopher" has some qualities that we might admire, but the Prawns generally do not. But we can sympathize with their situation, all while disliking them. They're very far from their own culture, without the means they need to function productively, and they are being treated like vermin. "District 9" doesn't let the audience off the hook for thinking that we can throw the concept of rights out the window because we fear someone, no matter how justified that fear may be.<br /><br />Maybe I am alone in this, but I am disturbed by the facile morality-by-emotional-response that I see so often. Writers and filmmakers have the idea that the way to make people examine the ethics of a situation or to understand another point of view is to make the "other" population like ourselves. If we can see ourselves in them, then they must be worthy of ethical treatment, or their point of view may be worthy of consideration. Films are certainly successful in employing this technique, and people do have a natural "like me" or "unlike me" reaction when confronted with something new, but that doesn't mean it is an acceptable standard for behavior. If people can't figure out how to act ethically when faced with someone they don't like or can't understand, we have a serious problem. That's not rational or moral behavior; it's self-indulgence. "District 9" doesn't take the easy way out. It gets the audience to come down on the side of ethics when faced with a muddy situation and a dangerous and incomprehensible enemy.<br /><br />"District 9" presents itself in the style of a documentary made after the events take place. It departs from documentary mode into a more cinematic style for action that the documentary crew obviously wouldn't see. But a lot of the film is handheld, so if a shaky camera makes you nauseated, you will need Dramamine. I did not find "District 9" to be as shaky as "The Bourne Supremacy" or any number of low-budget "independent" films. At least there is a reason for the shakiness, as the documentary crew is tromping around the slums. I also liked the fact that the violent action seemed plausible (not considering the alien technology), as it is not unheard of for military or heavily armed police to enter slums, nor for the residents to be heavily armed. It's a welcome respite from trucks and airplanes engaged in high speed chases on the freeway or downtown office buildings exploding with pretty fireballs perfectly synchronized to the score.<br /><br />The DVD (Sony 2009 single disc): Bonus features are 22 deleted scenes, one featurette, and an audio commentary. "The Alien Agenda: A Filmmaker's Log" (33 min) has 3 chapters, one about pre-production and the concept that became "District 9" (7 ? min), the second about shooting the film (16 min), and the third about post-production, including sound design and editing (9 min). Director Neill Blomkamp, producer Peter Jackson, co-writer Teri Tatchell, the creative crew, and cast are interviewed. Neill Blomkamp's audio commentary is constant and addresses the sociopolitical themes and how they relate to South Africa. He also talks about locations, filming, a lot of technical detail  of both big and small elements of the film. Subtitles for t he film are available in English SDH and French. Dubbing is available in French and English DVS.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q.html">A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q</a><br/><p>I remember when they began teasing this movie at Comic-Con. They and signs indicating places where only humans or aliens could venture. Almost everyone thought these signs were for the super secret J.J. Abrams movie (Cloverfield) but it turned out to be for the low-budget District 9.<br /><br />After making a short for YouTube, director Neill Blomkamp was encouraged to make it a feature with the blessing of Peter Jackson.<br /><br />Casting a bunch of no-names and having it take place is South Africa adds a flavor of realism if you can look past the fact that these are CGI aliens.<br /><br />The movie begins as a documentary but quickly changes to a typical action/adventure sci-fi movie with lots of guns, explosions and characters shouting the F-word almost every other word. I can tolerate maybe a one-time use in movies but when the word is used so much, it becomes distracting and my rating of the movie falls with each utterance.<br /><br />Add in a exoskeleton robot with massive firepower and what started as a clever film turns into just another summer action flick.<br /><br />I was impressed with the CGI. The aliens really looked like they were in the locations and interacting with the humans.<br /><br />Blomkamp also has a series of shorts that was his "request" to make the Halo movie on YouTube but it was never realized.<br /><br />District 9 is a movie with interesting social commentary with excellent effects.</p></br><a href="../users/A34IBXM7E8CPWE.html">A34IBXM7E8CPWE</a><br/><p>I have heard a wide variety of opinions concerning "District 9", and it seems as though folks either love or hate this film. Not sure why I put off watching it for so long, but I finally popped it in last night.<br /><br />At first I had a lot of reservations about the flick. The "hand held shaky" cam thing has been done to death with "Cloverfield", "Quarantine" & "Diary of the Dead". But there is a good reason a majority of the film is presented in this format which is laid out right at the beginning of the film. And while there are many scenes shot with the hand held camera, quite a bit of the film is shot in conventional style as well.<br /><br />The basic storyline is that aliens have come to Earth, most likely by accident, but we are never really told for sure. They've been living among us now for almost 3 decades and now must reside in a slum known as district 9. Crime is out of control, human citizens of Johannesburg want the aliens (prawns) taken out of the city. And as the film begins, we meet a low level bureaucrat who has been put in charge of relocating the aliens to a spot 200 miles outside of the city. Neither the aliens or the Nigerian gang who control the black market in district 9 want to relocate...and both are willing to kill to keep it from happening.<br /><br />I see some folks drawing similarities between "District 9" and a host of other Sci-Fi films, but I still think this is one of the most original films to come out in theaters the past couple years.<br /><br />The special effects are amazing. I normally hate CGI effects in a movie. More often than not they look like cartoons, but the CGI animation in "District 9" is phenomenal. The "prawns" look amazing, and for big buggy aliens, they somehow are still able to display a wide variety of emotion. The action is top notch, but this isn't a straight action flick, the action takes a backseat to the storyline and the characters. If you like a little more depth to your sci-fi I highly recommend you pick this up.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>Blu-Ray Review<br />Movie:  4/5  Video Quality:  5/5  Audio Quality:  5/5  Extras:  4/5  Overall:  4.5/5 (rounded up in total star ranking)<br /><br />We've all seen sci-fi films and stories where aliens come to Earth and lay down their dominance through superior technology and intellect.  But in the case of "District 9," we have something else entirely.  It's a rough and brutal film, portraying aliens not as the sleek, powerful, awe-inspiring beings from heaven.  Instead, these aliens are wretched, and humans are treating them like dirt.  Therein lies the strength and power of the film; it serves to showcase modern issues concerning refugee camps, shanty-towns, and social corruption, while simultaneously demonizing humanity.  With themes like these, "District 9" proves to be a truly unique and thought-provoking experience.<br /><br />As far as the entertainment value goes, the movie is not bad.  The first half is purely rough documentary-style, with interviews and news footage cut in throughout.  Then the second half resembles an actual film with lots of action (and some very gnarly violence).  As such, the plot is interesting and moves at a decent pace.  The story is generally not bad.  Characters are alright; there are some moments where the people do appalling things or act stupid, but I believe it goes hand-in-hand with the flawed portrayal of humanity in general.  Acting and writing are adequate.  Photography is solid half of the time and a bit shaky at other times; it's pretty good all around.  Production design features some great sets, props, costumes, creature effects, vehicles, and weapons.  Music is decent too.<br /><br />This disc has good quality.  Video quality is excellent for the most part; most of the movie shows strong sharpness and detail, with excellent color, contrast, and clarity.  A few parts may appear fuzzier or softer due to different cameras or film stocks used for the "archival footage," but overall, the disc offers the highest possible PQ overall.  Sound quality is good (DTS-HD MA 5.1).  This disc includes a number of extras (a commentary, 23 minutes of deleted scenes, documentaries, some interactive features, trailers, and more).</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>The best way to view this film is without knowing anything about it. Truly, it is best going into this completely blind. If you love watching something with an original spin on things, I really think this film has what you want. I mean, how often is it that you see a film where the aliens are the ones kept underneath the humans, treated like the lowest of the low, basically forced to live in their own filth? And that is just the setup to this really cool film. The actors are complete unknowns- and do a fantastic job, especially the lead. The movie itself, filmed quite inexpensively compared to just about anything nowadays, is filled with ridiculously awesome and realistic effects that makes Transformers 2 look like a video game.<br /><br />The reason I fell in love with District 9 is because this particular brand of Sci-Fi isn't just about effects and aliens and coverups. It actually has a plot, and a heart, so to speak. The humans you learn to despise and the aliens you completlely sympathize with. It's not a common occurance. I don't wish to give any of the plot away, so I will just say that the reason I did not give this film 5 stars is because of how it ended. I wasn't dissatisfied, per se, but I thought it a tad predictable, and is clearly screaming for a sequel. Either way though, District 9 is a great film, and certainly one of the better ones from 2009.</p></br><a href="../users/AJLYAY1G5Z8GE.html">AJLYAY1G5Z8GE</a><br/><p>An alien ship lands on Johanessberg and somehow was shutdown for 20 years. The aliens inhabitting it got out of the ship with the help of humans only to be living afterwards in a huge slum area called District 9. One human working for the MNU (multinational united), which is an organizaiton responsible for communicating with aliens, gets infected by an alien substance that causes his body to gradually transform into an alien being. By that happening to him, he is the only human being able to operate on the aliens weapons and machines, and therefore became a  target for all human organizations and companies interested in learning alien technology. He became their target, at all costs.<br /><br />This movie is different in the sense that it makes you side with the aliens against humans. You see the world through their eyes.<br />You also see that they are so fragile and weak without their technology, like humans.<br /><br />The movie is ok, I justed hated the way the aliens looked. They looked like the starwars creatures of Tattoine. I would have appreciated it more if they looked like the alien being usually described by those claiming to have encountered them (tall, grey, with big eyes).</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>This flick was definitely overhyped.  I was taken in by the rave reviews it got plus the Oscar nomination for Best Picture(!).  This is not the groundbreaking film you would be led to believe.  The docu-style filmmaking isn't exactly groundbreaking and it's been done before and better.  You might raise an eyebrow when you consider that it was done on a lower budget, $30 million, than your average Hollywood flick but that passes.  The Johannesburg locations are certainly exotic.  The analogy to apartheid is trite and obvious.  This flick certainly isn't in the same league as "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" or the first two "Alien" movies.  The best you can say about "District 9" is it moves pretty good and keeps your attention throughout.  Just don't confuse it as something significant because it certainly is not that.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>This is a tough film to review because I'm sure a lot of people loved it and a lot of people hated it. I liked the film because it is undeniably original and has a haunting quality with excellent FX. Unfortunately what I didn't like about it is that the film seems very choppy and loud, which distracts from the interesting story. I know this was intentional, but I'm not sure it was that way to go. I think the premise could stand alone without all of the bouncing around and explosions.<br /><br />No one seems to have touched on the fact that this film is a satire about illegal immigrants, I know the setting mirrors the apartheid, but it's really more global in its conception.  It's a very cool film, but I was bored at times, which is hard to believe because the film is stunning to look at.<br /><br />I wish that you could change your star ratings on reviews as I'm sure this film will grow on me over time and I might have bumped this one up another star.</p></br><a href="../users/AUUH6Z8MSGGF.html">AUUH6Z8MSGGF</a><br/><p><span class="tiny"> Length:: 4:35 Mins<br /><br /></span>Gina from Haunted Flower reviews the movie "District 9", written and directed by Neill Blomkamp.<br /><br />[...]</p></br><a href="../users/A8G9GETA2OLMZ.html">A8G9GETA2OLMZ</a><br/><p>The director says that "District 9" is primarily for entertainment, and should not be viewed as a political tract.<br /><br />But it is political, and quite well done because it insinuates an interesting message without being preachy.<br /><br />That's because nothing is stated, and everything is dramatized.  You are forced to draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />The main message is: prejudice is deep and almost intractable.  But this message is not immediately apparent because the aliens are deliberately creepy-looking and apparently vicious.<br /><br />In short, in Effective Prejudice style, the "other" is instantly dehumanized, and so it is easy to feel scared and defensive about them.<br /><br />But the rest of the movie humanizes the aliens, and de-humanizes the humans (quite literally in the case of the hero).<br /><br />By the end, you are rooting for the aliens and for the poor hero who realizes his own salvation depends on them, and against the paranoid and trigger-happy humans.<br /><br />The documentary style is flawless and jittery and involving.<br /><br />For U.S. viewers (like me), this apparent you-are-there realism is made stronger by the fact that all the actors are South African and to me unknown--they seem like actual people going through actual, unpredictable events.<br /><br />Superb.</p></br><a href="../users/A24IJY3V0804WJ.html">A24IJY3V0804WJ</a><br/><p>Aliens arrive on earth and are turned in to slaves and left to dwell in a slum in Johannesburg. The aliens are known as Prawns You get to know them and their surroundings and their likes and dislikes. In short the documentary like opening takes you in to the world of the prawns. They have been exploited and the people want them out of the city so the government assigns this task to a resettlement company called MNU. This is where the main human characters are introduced, the most interesting one is Wikus played by Sharlto Copley. This guy is the son in law of one of the bosses at MNU and is responsible for the displacement of the Prawns. The movie follows his story and how he messes up himself and the entire effort at MNU. The movie is all over the place in terms of the story but things are rarely boring for one thing it was a very fast paced movie and I found myself glued to the screen even though I find most Sci-Fi movies cliched. The reason this movie worked was the seamless jump it takes from the documentary like opening to the actual story and the many story devices that kept the story going such as the slums, the eating habits of the prawns, the gangs etc. The action is pretty hardcore with a lot of flesh and body innards flying around.

Those two friends are still my friends, but now I know not to take their advice on certain matters.<br /><br />"District 9" isn't a movie about aliens from outer space, though it does feature them.  It is a movie about xenophobia, Apartheid, corporate greed, and other real-life issues.<br /><br />"District 9" is a movie directed toward your social conscience and, in the end, your heart.  If you only see it as just another shoot-'em-up, blow-'em-up action film, then you are missing the point.  You may enjoy it for those elements too, but if you enjoy it JUST for those elements, then you probably need to learn a little bit more about the world around you to take this film in its proper social context.<br /><br />The special effects are top-notch, and I look forward to seeing this in either Blu-Ray format or even on regular DVD.<br /><br />******  December 23 addendum *********<br /><br />The Blu-Ray contains many bonus features, but not all of them are easy to see/read.  There are "MNU Files" on the aliens and the District 9 project, but the font is so small in the detail work that you can't really read them unless you put your face right up to the television.  If my Blu-ray player had a "Zoom" feature like my regular DVD player then I could manage, but it does not.<br /><br />Also, the subtitles are in white and superimposed on the film image itself.  That makes them hard to read sometimes.  Had they been in yellow they might be easier to read.  In the days before 16:9 TV sets, everyone watching a letterboxed film had black bars at top and bottom of screen, and those were where the subtitles usually were.  Less black bar space with 16:9 sets.</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>So many science fiction stories are about aliens attacking, subjugating, or exploiting humans.  In District 9, the shoe is on the other foot.<br /><br />One day, a gigantic space ship comes to a stop over Johannesburg, South Africa.  After a few months with no other movement and no communication, the ship is opened, only to discover over a million aliens living in squalor.  These aliens (eventually called, derogatorily, "prawns"), cannot explain how they came to be there, or how to operate the ship.  They are settled in Johannesburg and, after 20 years, the settlement is a massive slum.  The movie begins with the initiation of a massive resettlement process to move the aliens to a new "settlement" (a guarded camp away from Johannesburg and its people).<br /><br />To abide by international laws affecting refugees, a mid-level bureaucrat (Wikus) is assigned the task of getting the aliens to sign a release authorizing their relocation.  The interaction between Wikus and the aliens is comical and horrific at the same time.  But when Wikus is accidently sprayed with a strange "fluid," his life, and his relationship with the aliens, changes radically.<br /><br />The cinematography in District 9 starts off in a herky-jerky fashion, and the viewer gets pulled into an intense story just as the cinematography, and the plot, gets more complicated and coordinated.  At the end, I suspect 99% of all viewers yelled or thought, "What happens NEXT!"  We will never know, but it's a great topic to bring up with friends in a cafe.<br /><br />I've seen this movie twice, and I wish I would have watched it on the big screen.  I really see it as becoming a classic sci-fi flick, pushing the boundaries of what is typical - humans being noble and aliens being ethically challenged usurpers.<br /><br />Not this time.<br /><br />Unique weapons, a novel language, the matter-of-fact way of killing alien babies, NIgerian scammers, the power of money, the power of love, the status and treatment of refugees, ... these are all introduced in this film.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QNQQKJTL76H0.html">A3QNQQKJTL76H0</a><br/><p>District 9 is a refreshing break from the slew of mediocre big-budget sci-fi action flicks produced by Hollywood every year. Made on a tiny budget of $30 million by South African director Neill Blomkamp, it's amazing what he and his crew have been able to accomplish for so little money (comparatively speaking). The story is tightly woven and wonderfully acted by Sharlto Copley, a South African actor who plays the protagonist, Wikus van de Merwe. Blomkamp knows that the story drives a film, not the CG. The CG aids the storytelling, but shouldn't take center stage, something that many of the $150+ million Hollywood CG stinkers forget (ahem... <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NXSRX4">G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KZIRM2">Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</a>). In D9, the CG (provided by Vancouver-based SFX house Image Engine) is perfectly blended into the environments and feels natural and realistic. It never sticks out or takes you out of the sense of immersion.<br /><br />The story is about an alien ship that came to Earth 20 years ago and stopped over Johannesburg, South Africa. There it stayed motionless until the government sent in cutters to open up the ship, where they found a race of cricket-like beings huddled in squalid conditions. Leaderless, malnourished, and numbering over one million, they are given refuge on Earth and confined to slums on the outskirts of the city. Rife with crime, poverty, and violence, District 9 is policed by a private military contractor called MNU (Multinational United) and controlled by a profiteering Nigerian warlord/illegal arms dealer and his thugs. At the beginning of the film, Wikus, whose doofy appearance and demeanor is reminiscent of a young <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009IW8OE">Peter Sellers</a>, is tasked with evicting the alien residents of District 9 and relocating them to another settlement. During a search for contraband, without giving away too much of the plot, Wikus makes a discovery that changes his life, turning him from an MNU agent into a reluctant hero.<br /><br />Visually, the film has a very coarse look. As widely publicized, the story is based on South Africa's struggle with apartheid, and was filmed in an actual township in Soweto to give the film a dirty and gritty sense of authenticity, using handheld Red digital cameras to heighten the documentary feel. The story is smartly written and the themes of corporate greed, racism/xenophobia, poverty, and corruption are not hard to believe. Replace the alien refugees with humans and you can find this kind of squalor in many parts of the developing world, like we saw in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P9KR94">Slumdog Millionaire</a> (India) or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000D9PNX">City of God</a> (Brazil). Crime in South Africa is rampant and it's one of the most dangerous places on Earth in real life. Some of the alien weaponry is very cool and people explode like watermelons. Limbs get severed and there is a good amount of violence and gore in the film, so be forewarned if you are sensitive to such imagery. The climactic showdown at the end is also very exciting and well done.<br /><br />Stated influences for the film include the Alien and Terminator series, Robocop, Predator, and others, so if you enjoyed these films, you'll probably enjoy D9. Highly recommended for the sci-fi fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>on your typical alien-movie. I stumbled across this on cable while channel-surfing and I watched the whole thing. I don't think it is a spoiler to say that the gist of the movie is that a very large and damaged alien spaceship enters Earth orbit. Over 1 million stranded aliens are taken of the ship. What is to be done with them? I won't say any more but the plot is original and interesting. The only downsides is that the moralizing is slightly heavy-handed (no coincidence that the story is set in South Africa) and there was a bit of a devolution into traditional Hollywoodism (gun fights, car crashes, people blowing up, etc.).<br /><br />Also, the film is shot (in the beginning) in the style of a mockumentary (similar to Blair Witch or Cloverfield) which gives it a grittier and more realistic feel. The ending is maddeningly ambiguous (in a good way) as opposed to the cliche good winds, bad loses, and everything is right in the world. Nice touch.<br /><br />I thought this was a unique movie in an over-done genre.<br /><br />4.5 stars<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AHBNPMHDWZ7SB.html">AHBNPMHDWZ7SB</a><br/><p>It happens to me quite often that I'll go see a movie the day it comes out and really enjoy it. But then over time forget what I loved so much about it, and when I finally get the dvd all those months later, I watch it again and love it even more than I did when I first saw it. The same thing happened to me with Iron Man, Star Trek, Batman Begins, Casino Royale, and a whole laundry list of what are now most of my favorite all-time movies. District 9 is no exception. I recently watched it again, and it was ten times better the second time. Neil Blomkamp is a relatively unknown director, but he created a masterpiece. I think D9 is a classic, and it definitely should not be forgotten as the years go by. Sadly, I believe it will be forgotten because of the big shadow that Avatar casts. One thing that District 9 has is an uncanny originality that I had almost forgot existed in the movie business today. Most notibly in the alien sub-genre. Too many alien films follow the same suit. Unlike most other alien movies, the prawns are not portrayed as villains. They are victims. It kind of made me sad to see how they were mistreated. One thing D9 does do is evoke different emotions. The movie is gritty and tense, sometimes sad, yet funny at times. Despite the fact that it is not a conventional action movie, the scenes when the action does pick up are breathtaking. Literally, if you're squemish. I happen to be a very little bit squemish, but I thoroughly enjoyed watching mens' arms, heads, and even entire torsos a couple times, get disintergrated by the prawns' various guns.<br /><br />The cinematography in this film is nothing short of amazing. I never thought it was possible to be that captivated by the sight of a poor African slum, but D9 managed to surprise me more than a few times. The visual effects are spot on. I would even go as far as to say that they were way more realistic and believable than my favorite movie of 2009 (I doubt i have to name it). I have to mention the transformation of Wikus himself, brilliantly played by Sharlto Copley. I was glad that they used actual make up and tangible materials to create the prawn arm, rather than relying completely on CGI. I do love it, but I still have to admit that CGI has become a crutch for most. Speaking of Sharlto Copley's performance, how did he not get any major awards nominations? At least the Academy gave District 9 a nod for Best Picture, Visual Effects, Adapted Screenplay and Editing. Rather than the Best Pic nomination being a spot filler, I think it actually could have been a contender if the competion were not so strong this year. Nevertheless, District 9 is a work of genius and i do hope that there is a District 10. There were a lot of hints to it at the end of D9, so they better not disappoint. Thank God Peter Jackson and his team couldn't make that Halo movie they original set out to make, otherwise we would never have gotten District 9.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>District 9(released Aug./09)is a film  presented and produced by Lord of the Rings wonderkind Peter Jackson.Sony thought by putting his name conspicuously on the trailer credits it would entice the movie goers to give up their bucks at the box office...and it worked.What the tease trailer didn't show however was how long the film was going to be.I saw it on first release,and my opinion then,and after just having re-viewed it on DVD now,is the same...it is a little long.Having said that though,it is a compelling movie and if you stick with it you will be rewarded.<br />The story starts out in /82 when a huge spacecraft came to hover over Johannesburg,S.A.The locals waited and waited and finally moved on the ship and entered it.Inside they ran into alot of ETs...in fact over a million of them.They put them into nothing more than interment camps below,which was overseen by the MNU,a private security firm.<br />20 years come and go and the aliens,referred to as prawns because of their facial resemblance to them(they are bipedal),are rubbing the human population the wrong way.Finally comes the day when the MNU goes into the alien slums and tries to evict them for relocation away from the capital city and the peoples wrath.One Wikus Van Der Merwe(Sharlto Copley)is the desk jockey put in charge of the entire operation by the big boss of MNU,who just happens to be his father in law.Der Merwe is totally green and ill at ease at trying to deal with the situation.As we follow him and MRU around vis a vis a you-are-there type of camera style,we see and learn alot about how the aliens survive in the camp and how they are exploited not only by their own kind but by hard human outsiders,specifically a local band of Nigerian thugs who buy,sell and exploit them ad nauseum for their own wicked ends.<br />During what was supposed to be just another alien eviction Der Merwe encounters a father and son alien.Inside their shack he discovers a cylinder containing an unknown liquid.It accidentally sprays him in the face and after wiping it off he goes on with his job.The cylinder is bagged as evidence and sent to MNU headquarters for examination.As Der Merwe continues on he displays ever increasing signs of a terrible sickness coming on.After a couple of days his symptoms,such as losing fingernails and vomiting a yucky black ooze,he eventually finds he has grown an alien arm.The infection seems to be bent on turning him into a prawn.Back at the shack from whence the cylinder came from we learn that the father of the father/son aliens has been distilling a liquid for many years to be able to propel a spacecraft,which sits underneath his shack,up to the mother ship so they can leave.Der Merwe's confiscation of the cylinder has kyboshed  his plans.<br />Der Merwe's sickness has not escaped the watchful medical arm of MNU however.In fact with his father in laws permission,they want to eventually dissect him and harvest his body parts.Before they do this however,they want him to try and shoot several alien weapons which have been bio-engineered to work only with alien DNA.Against his will Der Merwe is forced to test fire the weapons,even on an innocent prawn.When they start to try and cut him open he is able to break away from the table and escape the building.He returns to the father/son alien with his dilemma to ask for their help.The father tells him if they had the liquid they could take him to the mother ship to return him to normal.With the aliens help they plan a break in of the MNU facilities,and they actually succeed in regaining control of the all important cylinder of liquid propellant.<br />Returning back to the settlement,and when all is in place,the alien tells Der Merwe that the process to return him back to normal will take three years(a trip to his home planet and back!).Der Merwe is in shock and as MNU troops close in on them Der Merwe commandeers the ship,but it is taken down shortly after take off.Der Merwe is taken hostage by the Nigerians and at the same time the alien has activated the mothership to move and hover over the downed ship on earth.Both father and son make their way to the ship while Der Merwe barely escapes with his life from the Nigerians,with a walking alien battle machine.Der Merwe battles the MNU troops,protecting the alien as much as he can.The aliens reach the ship and the mother ship,right on cue,lifts the smaller ship into the air until it is safely inside.<br />The battle ends and the film comes to its conclusion as we see Der Merwe,now fully turned into a prawn,sitting on a junk pile making flowers out of bits of scrap metal,which he deposits on the front doorstep of his home,for his wife to find;waiting for the three years to end.<br />The film is a definite metaphor for apartheid,coincidentally(?)situated in the very country it originated from.As the film opens we see the tell tale signs throughout Johannesburg of Humans Only or No Aliens Allowed. But this theme has a twist to it,as the very black population which was oppressed by the white minority,which resulted in the apartheid term in the first place,is now oppressing,along with Afrikaners,a new minority in the aliens.<br />When we first encounter the desk jockey Der Merwe,now put in charge of an operation which is clearly out of his league,we see him as a weak kneed and condescending company man,smiling and talking uncomfortably as the camera follows he and his team from MNU HQ and into the alien ghetto.When he gets violently ill and eventually starts to change into an alien,our original feelings,along with Der Merwes condescension towards the aliens,also changes.In other words as he becomes more compassionate towards them(in fact turning into one),we become more compassionate towards him.Finally,as I stated earlier,it is an overly long movie and it is this along with the directors slight over attention to details(that possibly should otherwise have been left out) that are the two main things that I find that work against it.The rest;the story,the pace and the S/Fx,is all good.<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its original a/r of 1:85:1.Extras include deleted scenes,commentary and a three part featurette on the making of the movie.<br />In conclusion,though a long and at times an unnecessarily detailed film,the movie as a whole is pretty good and if you stay with it it is worth watching.Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7.html">A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7</a><br/><p>I honestly wasn't expecting District 9 to be very good, I expected it to be decent at best. But, I was wrong. It exceeded my expectations in every area. Very good movie. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></br><a href="../users/ARFCORBCTKX1J.html">ARFCORBCTKX1J</a><br/><p>"District 9" is a remarkable film from a first-time director. It is so thoroughly professional and /assured/, from beginning to end, that it looks as if it's the work of someone with a lot more experience.<br /><br />It's such a finely crafted and rousing piece of movie-making that I was reluctant to give it only four stars. But I had to, because of serious plot and script problems. Even while you're watching, you're all-too-aware that none of it makes any sense. Why are the aliens unable to leave at the beginning, but suddenly able to do so at the end? Why does Christopher spend 20 years accumulating "fuel" to power the shuttle, then suddenly be able to move the mother ship by remote control and use a tractor beam to enter the ship? Why does the "fuel" cause Wikus to mutate (other than to make him the p[r]awn of MNU and the Nigerians)? Most of all, why were the aliens taken from the ship before anyone determined whether they could have been helped /without/ removing them?<br /><br />I'm often criticized for being overly rational (see my "Up!" review) -- "It's only a movie!". But I expect writers to think things through, rather than using whatever pops into their heads. The writers -- one of whom is the director -- supposedly came up with a dozen possible storylines. Peter Jackson apparently didn't bother to tell them that this one had Queen-Mary-sized holes in it.<br /><br />"District 9" is ultimately a drama (though a shallow and not well-developed one) about beings alien to each other learning a degree of trust and respect. It's a modest success on that level, despite failing to tell us much about the aliens' psychology and motivations. It /could/ have been a better film -- though it would have been even darker and more pessimistic than it is.<br /><br />The Blu-ray's image quality is exceptional. Most (if not all) of "District 9" was shot on Sony and RED equipment. Though the BD looks like film, I suspect it's the composite digital "negative", graded to look like motion-picture film. It is of absolute demo quality.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>The movie started off slow and directed like it was a documentary.  A mothership of aliens comes to Earth and stays hovered over  South Africa.  A military orginazation (NMU) sends a team of helicopters and moves the aliens to live in District 9, a hovel fillled area.  The aliens are called "prawns" and like to eat catfood.  The aliens also bring very advanced weapons that NMU is very interested in.  Unfortunately only the aliens can fire them because the weapons have sensors that only work with prawn DNA.<br /><br />The NMU decides that the aliens are to be relocated to another area a few miles away.  They send a team headed by one guy who seems like a "Monty Python" comedian.  He makes the aliens sign eviction notices.  I never could understand his name because most of the movie is spoken with very heavy South African accents and it was difficult to understand a lot that is said in the film.<br /><br />The spokesman discovers a viles of liquid that he tries tasting and it makes him sick.  He takes the liquid with him and then the liquid starts to change his body.  The changes make NMU very interested because his metamorphasis makes him able to use the alien weapons.  He goes on the run from the NMU and he has to stay alive while they are chasing him and also gets involved with some very bad Nigerian mafia.<br /><br />From this point the movie changes away from the documentary format and is very exciting and has a lot of tense moments.  The difficulty in understanding the accents does not matter and the action is excellent.  There are also some poigniant moments as he befriends one of the "scientist" prawns and the two team up to help him and also help the scientist prawn get back to the mother ship.<br /><br />I almost gave up on this movie but it turned out to be very good.  The special effects are similar to the Robocop movies but the great action and tense moments make up for the older effects.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G8D1VN3MVB6F.html">A2G8D1VN3MVB6F</a><br/><p>This is a decent movie. It is not too bad in that the story is compelling and it is shot in a decent manner, but this movie is somewhat poor in its timing and special effects. It just gets a slow at times and the special affects are somewhat corny. I mean the story just needed a little more editing to make the thing so good you could not turn away. However, as the movie was offered as a final product it is very slow at points. The acting was very good, and the movie made a point. It just was a little slow. Worth a watch, but not buying.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />District 9 does a lot of things right and offers some compelling science-fiction entertainment, so I'm able to forgive the fact that in the last half hour all ideas are thrown out the window in favor of nonstop action and poor characterizations (e.g. the Nigerians who show up so we can have another villain in the film); it's an intriguing film and at times a powerful one, but it could have been so much more.<br /><br />3/4</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Lately, Hollywood has seen science fiction films as a way to show off: look at what we can do, look at how creative and imaginative we are.  DISTRICT 9, thankfully, follows in the tradition of what science fiction set out to be: thoughtful, deep, with resonance in our contemporary culture.<br /><br />The film follows a colony of roughly one million aliens (dubbed "prawns" due to their crustacean appearance) that have essentially crash-landed on earth.  Unable to go anywhere else, they have been restricted to District 9 in Johannesburg, a run-down shantytown typical of refugee camps.  After 20 years, the inhabitants of Johannesburg have become fed-up with their neighbors.  It is time for the prawns to be relocated.  However, in the midst of handing out eviction notices, Wikus Van De Merwe (an outstanding, Oscar-deserving Sharlto Copley) becomes infected with a prawn concoction, a substance that is slowly altering his DNA.  Wikus is suddenly forced to side with a people he has subjugated and ridiculed, and must fight to save not only his own humanity, but the existence of an entire species.<br /><br />It's true, DISTRICT 9 becomes bogged down near the end in special effects.  Still, the first two-thirds of the film are phenomenal, showcasing humanity's interaction with what we don't understand.  The effects alone are worth the price of admission; the effects are outstanding, with the aliens interacting flawlessly with the humans around them.  Yet it's the story, the emotional power behind it, that will help DISTRICT 9 stand the test of time.  This will go down as a science fiction classic, another in a long tradition of sci-fi films that dig deep beneath the human skin, that aim to shine a spotlight on our human foibles.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>District 9 is something that perhaps no one saw coming, and ends up being the absolute best movie of the summer hands down. Produced by Peter Jackson and helmed by Neill Blomkamp (the director Jackson hand picked for the shelved Halo movie), District 9 depicts an alien race that came to Earth on an emergency basis a couple decades before hand, and have since become refugees in a violent slum in Johannesburg. Bureaucrat Wikus (Sharlto Copley) is charged with serving eviction notices to the alien "prawns", and through a mishap, ends up undergoing a horrifying transformation that makes him a wanted man by everyone. As he and a prawn dubbed Christopher Johnson become unlikely allies, things begin to really kick into high gear. Beginning as part mockumentary and part satire on apartheid, District 9 takes its time to become a bloody full-blown action/sci-fi opus that stays with you long after the credits are done rolling. What also helps make District 9 so good is that you truly never know what is going to happen next. The sheer unpredictability of the film helps make it so magnetic, and newcomer Copley manages to be hateable, likable, and sympathetic all at the same time as his character continues to develop and change (literally) as the film goes on. All in all, District 9 is an incredible science fiction film that features equal parts action and heart, and in a bloated summer full of empty blockbusters like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, G.I. Joe, and the like; it is indeed refreshing to see something like this on the big screen. Do yourself a favor, don't miss out on District 9.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>On most occasions, I am a fan of science fiction films.  In the case of "District 9", however, the experience was just a little too bizarre to appeal to me.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the future story of human-alien interactions.  Instead of the traditional "us vs. them" battle, we have exiled them to a slum-like area where corruption breeds.  Unbeknownst to the humans, however, the aliens (Prawns) have been working on a way to go home, a method that is ultimately set in motion by a strange series of events.<br /><br />For extremely hard-core sci-fi fans, I think "D-9" will really resonate.  It is completely original, full of "future tech", and contains enough action to satisfy the "shoot 'em up" crowd.  In an age of sequels and recycled plots, I have to give the creators credit for thinking up such out-there stuff.<br /><br />From a "regular movie" standpoint, though, "D-9" is just too fractured and strange to be considered a success.  Besides the main character (and even so much more could have been done with him), this is a typical "black and white" film.  The bad guys are mustache-twirling fiends, while the good guys are portrayed as innocent of everything.  I call this the "Avatar Effect", and prefer a bit more ambiguity ("shades of grey") in the character development.  Plus, just when (at times) you think the plot is really heating up, it usually gets bogged down in more laser blasts and military action.<br /><br />Thus, while not a terrible movie by any means, "D-9" was just too strange and ultimately formulaic for this reviewer.  If you appreciate "left field" ideas, however, then you will like it more than I.  2.5 stars would be a more accurate rating, but I couldn't give it the benefit of the doubt for 3.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>A friend of mine and I were sharing opinions about District 9. I liked it better than I thought I would. He thought it was brilliant. He wrote that it was a very incarnational film. This was a definite theme. The main character was contaminated by a liquid and he was slowly being turned into an alien. The man had insights into the human condition and the alien condition that he never had before. He was selfish and became sacrificial at the end. Another example, the gangster wanted to eat alien flesh so that he could become an alien. The bad military officer was eaten at the end. Some of the aliens were more humane than any of the humans.<br /><br />The movie's newsreel style was a slight turn off at the beginning, but it grew on me. The foreshadowing was a key part of the picture. Hinting at regular intervals at what was coming, kept my interest in the movie. The special effects were very good. The character development, except for the main character, was very limited. The mother ship just hanging over the city was a cool special effect. The parallels of the treatment of aliens in the movie and apartheid were strange.<br /><br />The movie is deeper than one thinks at an initial viewing. The movie stays with me and I keep coming back to the themes it presents. The movie is very subtle in some ways. I strongly recommend the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>I've always wondered why, in science fiction movies dealing with human/alien contact, the aliens are almost always the bad guys.  It's always them invading us, or us getting out there and meeting with aliens who turn out to be midlessly vicious or innately evil.  Assuming that there are probably a lot of alien civilizations in the hundred billion odd galaxies in the universe, it's not unreasonable to think that some of them will turn out to be warlike.  But we know that humans have launched wars more than occasionally, so it always seemed to me that there should be some alien invasion movies where the humans are the invaders, or some where aliens arrive at Earth and are greeted by humanity's mean side ("Alien Nation" did this quite a while back, but it was one of the few).  Also, there seemed to be missed opportunities in that in the human/alien conflicts, wouldn't there be situations where neither side was all bad or all good?<br /><br />  Well over the last year or two these very concepts have clearly gotten their day, and District 9 is one of the leaders of the pack.  While not being a totally black-or-white scenario, the human response in this first contact situation turns out not to be as noble as one would like, and disturbingly realistic with numerous real-life parralells.<br /><br />  A massive alien ship enters Earth's atmosphere and rather than hovering over a city like New York or London, ends up over Johannesberg, South Africa, in what's soon to turn out to be an unfortunate irony.  The ship is broken down, out of supplies, doesn't have the ability to communicate, and is packed with what appear to be starving refugees.  Upon the initial arrival of the ship, the whole world is excited at the prospect of contact and the dawn of a new era.  Upon the initial discovery of the aliens's sad state, the whole world is prepared to pitch in and help the hundreds of thousands of new arrivals.  Flash forward twenty years, though, and it's a far grimmer picture.  No new era has dawned with man being inducted into interstellar society or reaping the economic benefits of contact with and trade with a technologically advanced civilization.  Humanity has never figured out how the alien tech worked and was therefore never able to tap into its potential benefits.  Most of the surviving aliens, even after communication, were no more able to explain how everything functioned than the average modern human passenger on a commercial airplane would be able to tell a stone age tribe how to build their own jets.  The aliens, referred to by humans as 'prawns' (a label considered derisive by many of the aliens) apparantly can't return home, and the costs of housing and accomodating their growing population became something the world started to get tired of.  It also cost a lot to try and figure out how to work their technology, especially their weapons (of huge interest to the nations of the world) and no benefit came from that either.  So twenty years later, rather than being honored guests, the aliens are crammed into a poverty-ridden ghetto in the middle of Johannesberg in a situation that not only bears an uncomfortable resemblance to South Africa's apartheid past, but to other world situations past and present.  Humanity, once so fascinated with the aliens, is tired of them and views them as a burden.  And inside the ghetto known as 'District 9', the 'prawns' have reacted to their deprived state, their seemingly dead-end future, and the hostility of much of the world around them, in the same way humans in the same situations do: they've lost hope, they're attempting to eke out meager livings on the bottom rungs of society (salvaging human landfills for junk and scrap metal, for example), some of them have turned violent in a new prawn undersociety of alien thugs, and many of them have become substance addicts (in the aliens's case, to catfood, originally simply a cheap meal that no one anticipated would have such an addictive effect on their alien physiology).  Human society has attempted to limit the prescence of these 'undesirables' in appalingly familiar ways - confining them to their own ghetto and not letting them out, population control measures (even including forced abortions, in a highly disturbing angle), and now, finally, the time has come that Jonnasberg has decided that they want the aliens out of the city altogether and a private military contractor is preparing to move them - by force if necessary - to a camp in the desert that will be known as District Ten.<br /><br />  We see much of the movie through the eyes of Wikus Van De Merwe (a great performance by Sharlto Copley), a civilian official working with private contractor MNU, and here's part of where the movie picks up its "not black or white" status: Wikus doesn't see himself as a bad guy, or as 'anti-prawn'; he's aware that the current situation is horrid, is aware that the solution of forcible relocation has all kinds of practical and moral flaws, but seems to see it as the best available option.  He's also guilty himself on at least a couple of occasions of some horrifying actions, but he doesn't view it that way, partly because he's not relating to the alien people the way he would to human people; he actually seems to think he's doing the best thing for them. It's only when some totally unexpected events make Wikus an outsider himself, and he and some of the aliens are forced to work together, that he begins to see the brutality of their daily situation more clearly, and the cold ruthlessness of the private contactor he's been affiliated with.  Also adding to the "not black or white" angle: some of the prawns Do come off as bad guys - certain ones are beligerant, crude and violent.  If humanity was to judge the prawns ONLY on those representatives they'd have good reason to be wary.  Two obvious real-life parallels here: the folly of judging an entire group or race only by its worst members; and the fact that we're seeing the prawns After years of ill treatment.  Were the nasty ones that violent to begin with, or is it, to at least some degree, a consequence of the way they've been treated?  There's another level to the run-down state of the alien society on Earth, and this one doesn't really have real-life parallels because it's based on alien physiologies and technologies and so on.  It's not asked outright, but it's pretty clear in the subtext - did whatever happened to cripple their ship originally have some direct effect on the aliens themselves, either physically or psychologically?<br /><br />  In the first ten minutes or so of District 9, it became abundantly clear that it was a very well-done movie, but I also thought I might be in for one of the most depressing movies ever made.  It's not though.  There are tragic and melancholy parts to it, even depressing parts, but oh, there are also some parts that are just jaw-droppingly Awesome.  The movie runs the gamut through all kinds of tragedy and triumph, unexpected plot turns, characters changing their points of view both on other individuals and on whole situations, several major turning points.  The prawn aliens are very individualized, with their own personalities, temperaments, etc. - they're as much Characters as the human characters, not just a bunch of aliens where one is indistinguisable from another.  An alien named Christopher Johnson (they all have names that humans can pronounce and would be familiar with in addition to the names in their own click-language, which a number of humans can understand but none are physically capable of speaking) and his young son become major players in a series of unexpected events that also involve Wikus.<br /><br />  Highly cerebral with great action, tremendous visuals, memorable characters and high tension, District 9 is great on all levels.  Highly recommended, although certain disturbing or bloody scenes may be more than many scence fiction fans are used to.  Although really, there's no other way they could have filmed this and had it be as effective.  Recommended for all except young children.</p></br><a href="../users/A6FIAB28IS79.html">A6FIAB28IS79</a><br/><p>I recall film critic Andrew Sarris giving a lecture about the revolutionary nature of "Night of the Living Dead," produced for mere thousands with amateur actors and a single "premise" rather than a plot.  More importantly, it started out, practically from the first frame, with terrifying shots, scaring the wits out of spectators, and seemingly going from one higher climax to another with no ultimate climax in sight.<br /><br />But excise the "action" scenes from "Living Dead," and all that's left is a lot of dead time and empty space, with nothing of consequence happening on the screen or in the viewer's mind. But not to worry. The sequels reduced the down time, with Romero taking the premise to ridiculous extremes, providing non-stop violent action from the very first frame and with little if any let-up. Then came the "Evil Dead" series of Bruce Campbell-Sam Raimi, which somehow managed to go even further with the continuum of violence and suspense, so much so that, like the later "Living Dead" films, the so-called suspense becomes so outrageous that the line between horror and humor is frequently blurred if not obliterated.  But such campiness is apparently the last thing some fans of "District 9" want to hear.  Even "Invasion of the Body Snatchers," a political thriller if there ever was one, would no doubt be preferred by those who see "District 9" as remarkably sui generis, non-intertextual, beyond comparison. There is no shortage of formulaic movies that "District 9" can be compared with, though one has to agree that "Psycho" or "Vertigo" isn't one of them.  The transformations of Norman and of Madeleine amount to highly disturbing moments of self-descovery to the spectator who has identified with either character, so totally that the experience is unshakeable yet unavoidable: without their metamorphoses into the hidden "other" persona of each, the movies and their spectators would both be incomplete.<br /><br />A second viewing reinforces the conclusion that  Bomkamp deserves to be applauded for producing one of the fine films of the past 5-6 years.  He's a daredevil, a movie lover, and apparently a thinker.  Yet if risk deserves any awards, "There Will Be Blood" is the sort of film one doesn't expect to see produced any more.  There will always be audiences of all ages for "District 9"'s, but you could never say the same for Hitchcock's "Vertigo," Altman's "Nashville," and Anderson's epic film of national self-scrutiny.  They demand analysis and interpretation; "District 9" plays O.K. without it.<br /><br />What intrigues about the film is its ability to hold the audience' attention.  How can a roller-coaster thrill-ride be constantly engaging without pacing, without the moment of anticipation as the cart rises pending its precipitous free fall and screams?  In this film suspense and horror are largely subordinate to violence, action, revulsion (much of it reminding me of the popular medical "freak shows" on cable TV), and confusion (the contending parties at times become almost too many for the viewer to keep track of--which works to keep the viewer slightly off balance, as if in a tense, vertiginous state).  To suggest, as some reviewers have, that all of the engrossing action has an intricate or even broad allegorical meaning that will be apparent to the majority of viewers is merely to invite incredulity among those of us who do not find such science fiction spectacles to be all that profound, mind-altering, or even provocative.  (Kubrick invited interpretation--in fact, required serious reflection of the viewer of "2001: Space Odyssey" for the film to accumulate the power of serious literature.  David Lynch accomplished the improbable: making us love as a brother a fellow specimen who, alongside an elephant, is by far the greater alien; and in "Blue Velvet" he constructs a narrative positioning the viewer to choose between judging what he's seen as pornography or as an exceptionally graphic, modern version of "Young Goodman Brown."  The viewers I can find who have seen "District 9," on the other hand, seem to remember little about the film in particular but recommend it in general as "wild," "over-the-top" entertainment and inventive, resourceful film-making--which still places it short of significant art or, for that matter, fascinating storytelling let alone in-depth character study.<br /><br />The film is capable of holding the spectator's interest thanks to the rapid editing, mix of film stock, shaky hand-held camera shots, and construction of the prawn-like, insect-like aliens.  Like the "Living Dead" films and the cold war thrillers (from "Body Snatchers," "Manchurian Candidate," etc.) the potential for political allegory is there but, even less than the Romero films' portrayal of the paranoia incited in the conservative establishment by the flower-child revolt of the '60s--later revealed as a new "consumer power"), it fails to deliver on this promise.  80% of the film's dialogue is made up of a single 4-letter word, which is not sufficient to give the spectator a picture of an intolerant or totalitarian state.  To the viewer who makes the effort, the film brings out the degree to which, even as we put forth the appearance of humanitarianism and equal rights, we alienate ourselves through greed, self-interest, and a narrow, selfish pride.  The result is that we eventually become aliens ourselves, as the film's last shot so memorably discloses, allowing us room to interpret which of two creatures is the greater alien.<br /><br />Creditably, even in Wikus' transformation into the apparent alien, we sense some room for sympathy for this creature of metal, steel, and electronic circuitry.  And unlike so many of his cousins in other sci-fi dystopias, he has not been victimized by technology.  Nor is the film's antagonist the evil state, bureaucracy, dictatorship, or governing institutions: it's rather the sin of Adam, as old as the very first texts and no less "original."  Just as "District 9"'s protagonist becomes alienated from his garden, he, unlike Kafka's diminished and vitiated insect hero, retains the power to make his own garden.  Moreover, he has been given reason to "believe"--the source being not some "other" creature but his own "sweetie" son--with a promise of deliverance in 3 years' time.  Insufficient, perhaps, in Biblical terms but no doubt a torturous delay for those anxious for the sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>District 9 [Blu-ray] (2009)- was an excellent sci-fi film with outstanding special effects and rates five stars from this reviewer. While not for the overly cerebral it was a very interesting special effects film which deserves a good sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A26R4PDCZX5SOK.html">A26R4PDCZX5SOK</a><br/><p>3 of 5 stars for the sci-fi movie District 9. Believe it or not, I really had not seen any trailers nor clips from this movie. I was excited to see it just because it seemed like another Independance Day. So, I had no idea what to expect when it started. To summarize first, I was disappointed but still liked it enough to give 3 stars. The short version is a group of aliens come to the Earth and their mother ship gets stuck hanging above South Africa. This event happened many years ago and the aliens are now living in slum-like conditions in a prison camp. The style of this movie is to look like a news program or a documentary. Alot shot on video rather than film gives a crisp look. It seemed like a low budget film until you realize the high quality seamless special effects. So, I was not all that impressed with this movie and will give it a mildly positive recommendation. The blu-ray has some good behind the scenes materials that are helpful in understanding why the movie is as it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A2P2JXU9JEYNV3.html">A2P2JXU9JEYNV3</a><br/><p>"District 9" is such a great film on many levels. The first thing that comes to mind is the apartheid that hamstrung the country it takes place in, for so many years. It was disheartening to see it resurrected once more, not for the Blacks, but the aliens (which is in itself curious, because there are blacks in the film treating the aliens as they were once treated).<br />The aliens themselves seemed like animals at times, and being human, we tend to "lessen" them because of this. Of course, their societal norms are very different from ours, and because of this, they tend to be a bit shall we say....Destructive? So they are segregated.<br />You are immediately immersed in the film from the very start, because of the "Live news coverage" nature of the film. The "live roving camera" style isn't as bad as far as motion sickness goes, and the violence is VERY convincing. The aliens (or "Prawns" as they are derisively called) for being CGI, are, as well. So much so, that one would probably not bat an eye if they actually showed up in "person"!<br />The secretive and subversive nature of the MNU (or "MultiNational Union") is also convincing, because so many nations already do these sorts of things, already. It's henchman soldiers hark back to the French Foreign Legion, because they operate in much the same way as the FFL did, in it's heyday.<br />I found the film touching, in some respects, because the Human protagonist, Wikus Van De Merwe, Only found his humanity, when it was finally lost, and the alien protagonist, "Christopher Johnson", found that not all humans are evil, but just "misguided".<br />Peter Jackson hit a homer with "District 9". He also left considerable room for sequels, as well, which is good, because I would very much like to see some threads resolved.<br /><br />I recommend "district 9" not for it's SFX, or it's acting, action, or camera work. It is recommended because it leaves you thinking long after the credits (because my assessment here, is not the only conclusion you may be left with). easily 5 stars!</p></br><a href="../users/A6X6LNZO1C3EZ.html">A6X6LNZO1C3EZ</a><br/><p>Hey, this may not rival the mega block buster epic sagas of science fiction that have millions to spend on production, but it actually was done pretty well and the underdog wins. I don't know about you but I've just about had enough of cliff hangers or giant efforts to make evil industructable to the point of getting numb as a viewer not knowing what to believe. This movie (D9) ignores the stereo typical ideas for sci-fi and gives me a sense of hope that no matter what sometimes the right champion emerges against all odds. On one hand it is shameful the producer drops the name 'Lord of the Rings' as part of his work, because D9 isn't even in the same league by any definition - not anywhere even close. But it is great to see some body count happening where it should and for what little budget there was obviously used (not used), I'd still recommend this movie for die-hard sci-fi fans. Not because it is fantastic, but because crawfish prawns deserve to be heard. The unlikely alliance formed is laughable but still a great idea to base the story's plot upon nonetheless. The armored suit machine had my attention, and I couldn't help but realize I need one of those myself in real life for about a week or two (hee hee hee hee). Don't spend big bucks on this movie - get it used, single disc edition, and that way you can still enjoy it. I'm grateful Amazon dot com has those kind of options and such a variety of reviews. BTW there's no female nudity so up front you're getting told here that the R rating is for language and violence. Good movie worth watching, even if I didn't recognize any superstar actors or actresses.</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>So much negative stuff for this movie...so i made sure i knew all of it before<br />watching it.  Bottom line...i found it pretty good. At least you see the creatures<br />and not just glimpses...yes they have hand held cameras at the beginning...but they<br />dont shake as much as previous stupid movies...the shots are from news types feeds.<br />The shakes are acceptable for this movie. I was glad once they dropped most of the<br />news feed and got to the movie....and how about that main character.....hummm that<br />quite some casting they must have done......not.<br />  Once the movie starts moving,,i found it interesting and by the end of the movie,<br />i was hoping they come out with the sequel a.s.a.p. cause there is so much<br />possibilities....earth invasion...partial future invasion...<br />Good for a view.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>I admit the final half hour or so of this was extremely good, but I hated it virtually from the first few minutes.<br /><br />Several believability problems:<br /><br />1.  Housing the aliens wouldn't have been a hassle!  For something like that, countries would be vying to host them -- for research purposes, if nothing else.  The UN would probably have to maintain a waiting list.<br />1.  How are you gonna fit 1.5 million creatures in that ship?<br />2.  Civilizations in which when the leader dies, the masses are helpless and directionless are not civilizations that perfect interstellar travel.<br />3.  The ship wouldn't have flown at the end!  It had been there for like 20 years!  Human engineers would have torn that thing apart by then!<br />4.  Humans would have been able to activate the aliens' weapons by using their severed limbs.<br /><br />So literally the movie is impossible to swallow.  This leaves us with its allegorical meanings.<br /><br />This, also, was repugnant.  Not for a second could I buy the filmmakers' heavy-handed metaphor of the aliens as refugees.  Are they trying to say the prejudice against aliens is analogous to the prejudice against immigrants in our own society?  If so, they could have done a much better job showing how the fear of aliens might have some rational underpinnings.  As it was, it was as if the humans' fear and hatred of the aliens was completely baseless.  If we had been told that the aliens had had, say, some equivalent to Koran 47:3, then the movie wouldn't have struck me as so simplistically one-sided.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>This movie came with a great deal of hype and frankly it just doesnt live up to it.

Yeah, yeah, I get the story is a metaphor for Aparteid, set above Johannesburg etc..but it just really didnt resonate with me.

For all that, I enjoyed it very much. Wouldn't really want to enjoy it a 2nd time. TV writer/director Neill Blomkamp is new at the helm. He deserves kudos for this as a 1st effort.<br /><br />Sharlto Copley plays priggish South African civil servant loser Wikus Van De Merwe, in charge of a specially designed concentration camp move for over a million extraterrestrials who have been camping in Johannesburg for two decades. They arrived, sat in Johannesburg's airspace for several months and were finally 'rescued' by the humans.<br /><br />This is inexplicable and rather stupid to start with, but we are told in a single rapid-fire line of dialogue that these are 'worker drones' without leadership. Hence they fall apart and are easily cowed into the slum created for them at the edge of town.<br /><br />Other than the ridiculous mockumentary style--which is a total waste here--this is just the beginning of a string of unnecessary stupidities. Van De Merwe's idiotic mugging for the "documentary" aside, I couldn't at any time see how that added to the film.They had a damned good idea here, and simply didn't run with it. As a friend of mine says, mom and dad went to bed and left the gas on....<br /><br />This film cannot go totally unpraised. The shooting was smooth, and better than I expected. The acting is top notch (except for the strangely dorky Copley), I loved seeing all those South Africans acting their hearts out, and the whole staging of it was rather compelling. That is why I lament them trying to make this look like some kind of Discovery Channel mess.<br /><br />There is little swearing (among other hilarious antics, one alien does let loose with a swear word, but then again, it is in "Alien", therefore subtitled). The aliens were the most endearing part of this, very believable yet borrowed right out of MEN IN BLACK. The alien mothership was stolen right out of the storage room for INDEPENDENCE DAY.<br /><br />Well, I advocate at least one watching of this...be warned that the accents are pretty thick, it is South Africa. (Yet a weird high-ranking individual is American.) If you are interested in the inane dialogue, you may not catch what they are saying the 1st time.<br /><br />You will not fail to be surprised and moved, even if you see it all coming because really, you've seen it all before.<br /><br />And that is the real shame of this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P98DMX8YUSNW.html">A1P98DMX8YUSNW</a><br/><p>Posed as a pseudo-documentary, this 09 sci-fi makes some very heavy-handed comments on what happens when minorities must live oppressed by uncaring majorities. The aliens are the weak ones here, and their human oppressors try to relocate them into distant camps like American Indians or WW2 Japanese Americans. Despite the social commentary, this plays quite entertainingly, and is actually a very funny film as we watch the narrator slowly turn into an alien. Lots of violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>*** This review contains spoilers ***<br /><br />Right away 'District 9', with the giant alien mother ship hovering in the sky, reminded me of the earlier movie and TV series 'Alien Nation'. That TV Series actually was an improvement over the original movie as the characters had some wonderful idiosyncrasies and you could easily identify with them as they represented a new (and also familiar) ethnic group. Not so with District 9. The aliens look part insect, part crab and have an unintelligible language consisting mainly of clicks and other weird sounds (somehow the aliens can easily understand English but we viewers must watch subtitles; it's not very clear whether humans in the story can understand the 'prawns' very well--you never see any interpreters assisting any of the soldiers when they enter District 9 and attempt to evict the prawns). Even worse is the fact that the prawns are not a very likable bunch as they are scavengers and as we are informed from the outset, constantly committing crimes against the human population which leads for the call for them to be relocated.<br /><br />The first half hour of 'District 9' is devoted to what I would call a mockumentary (similar to the film 'Waiting for Guffman'). The film takes place in Johannesburg, South Africa and various people are interviewed providing the back story of the alien arrival and subsequent colonization on earth. The filmmakers were lucky to find an abandoned shantytown in Soweto where set designers ably created a massive junkyard inhabited by the prawns. During the mockumentary, it's established that some kind of command module floated down to earth from the mother ship but for some reason, after 20 years, it's never been located inside District 9. I would think that if an alien ship actually landed here on earth, there would have been a huge team of international investigators searching for that module and no doubt finding it after a short search.<br /><br />District 9 becomes more confusing when we're introduced to the protagonist, Wikus Van De Merwe. He's a bureaucrat who also happens to be the son-in-law of the director at MNU (Multinational United), the corporate group of military contractors who have been awarded a contract to relocate the prawns to a cleaner district outside of Johannesburg. I could never understand why the company needs to have the prawns EACH sign an eviction notice before being relocated. The explanation is that it's a 'cover' but how could the company possibly have 1.8 million uncooperative creatures sign an agreement? If they kept the operation closed to the public, there would have been no need for those eviction notices. Wikus looks ridiculous traipsing around trying to collect signatures and he's such a buffoon of a character that one wonders if the filmmakers were actually going for comedy toward the beginning of their narrative. Certainly the prawns' ravenous desire for cat food adds to the comedy and a group of Nigerian criminals also get short shrift here too as they have no regrets about living inside the odious District 9 and scamming the prawns for alien weapons (which they don't know how to use) in exchange for cat food.<br /><br />The mockumentary is pretty much dispensed with as we break into the second act of the story. A prawn and his son have been working for years developing some kind of fuel to power the command module back to the mother ship. Wikus manages to ingest some of the black goo and much like the movie 'The Fly', he grows a prawn hand. The bad guys from MNU (they're all bad!) decide to cut Wikus up and sell his body parts to the highest bidder (there's some mumble jumble talk about how his 50-50 human/prawn DNA will sell very well on the black market). Wikus of course escapes and begs for help from the prawn and his son inside the underground module. The prawn can possibly help him in three years after returning to the mother ship but only if they can get the container containing the black goo from MNU headquarters which Wikus had confiscated when he first found it. Much like Terminator 2, Wikus and the prawn break into the impenetrable building and grab the container, only to be chased by MNU's top killer.<br /><br />Wikus is then captured by the Nigerians but manages to escape by fitting himself into a giant robotic fighting machine (shades of Transformers and Iron Man!). Our Bad guy killer from MNU manages to finally disable the robot and Wikus falls to the ground almost unconscious. Wikus however is saved when a bunch of prawns rip the MNU guy's head off (fortunately there are no close-ups). Oh yeah--the prawn and his son use the goo to power the module back to the mother ship. Everyone's thrilled when the ship leaves our atmosphere. Back to the mockumentary where we learn the prawns have been resettled.<br /><br />From a confused and awkward stab at comedy, District 9 tries to get real emotional when Wikus and the Prawn and his son BOND! Suddenly the prawns are actually sensitive creatures and Wikus is a hero for saving them! None of it works, since we haven't been invested in the unsavory Prawns from the beginning nor do we care about Wikus, despite all the pseudo-heroic machinations.<br /><br />If you watch the extras on the DVD, you'll learn that the script was patched together by the director and a co-writer on the fly and that the director really didn't have much of a clue as to what he was doing as he went along. I'll confess that the editing team saved this movie from being a complete disaster. Nonetheless, it's clear that the filmmakers tried to straddle between the worlds of both comedy and pathos and ended up with a hybrid of pure goofiness.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGVB3T5QJNRE.html">A3DGVB3T5QJNRE</a><br/><p>I'm starting to truly believe that a large segment of the human race (mostly male) has a defective gene. This defective gene causes a love of gruesome violence and a total lack of concern for the suffering of others. This gene also promotes binary thinking - the guy with the white hat is good and the guy with the black hat is bad. There's no in-between. And if there is - who cares!<br /><br />A certain segment of Hollywood knows how to precisely exploit this genetic weakness and billions of dollars pour into their bank accounts. Telling a good story is a lost cause for this segment of the population. Show as much blood, guts, torture and torment as possible. It's such a formula recipe, it could be written on the back of a matchbook cover: Blood, guts, action = BILLIONS, year in, and year out! Why didn't I think of that?<br /><br />If you love oceans of blood, vomiting, heads and limbs popping off of bodies with regularity, a graphic torture chamber used for medical experiments and repeated attempts at cutting off someone's arm - then District 9 is for you! And there is also ZERO sexuality in this film. (Why am I not surprised?)<br /><br />The only reason I didn't walk out was because I wanted to see if the good guys were going to win in the end. I did actually care about the main characters and the gruesome violence made watching District 9 all that much sadder and annoying to watch.<br /><br />THIS NOT A FILM FOR CHILDREN!! If the images shown do not disturb your children, I suggest they need to get some help. THIS IS A WAR PORN MOVIE! It exploits the audience, plain and simple!<br /><br />Beside feeling sad, I felt empty when I left the theater. Lucky for me I was able to sneak into another movie and watch it for free. It showed only a single act of serious (and accidental) violence and that story was an absolute delight! Too bad Hollywood doesn't make more great movies that actually entertain instead of making films that are so depressing and annoying!<br /><br />See:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1475075049">Save Me the Aisle Seat: The Good, the Bad and the Really Bad Movies: Selected Reviews by an Online Film Reviewer</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1456312812">What's A Nice Actor Like You Doing In A Movie Like This?: The ultimate guide to the most embarrassing movies in history, and the celebrities who appeared in them.</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1446522814">War, Sadism and Pacifism - Further Essays on Group Psychology and War</a>and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/076791547X">Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans from Colonial Times to the Present</a></p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Not my cup of tea,would recommend to die-hard scifi fans. I should have known since Peter Jackson(Lord of the rings EW!) presents it, and this is a rookie director's first movie(hopefully the last? or no sequel)The movie is not bad, it's just the message that somehow Human beings are bad and greedy. That we would use alien technology,etcera. Another one of those deep social messages like avatar. First off, If it were aliens they would do the same thing.<br />Second, Yes it's science fiction. but poor science fiction. sorry but I don't want preachy over-lying "Anti-Imperialist" themes that are so passe.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>The biggest problem with this film is its lack of realism. For example, a lot of the plot revolves around acquiring the space aliens' weapons - yet, they aren't any better than what earthlings have. Secondly, another theme is the 'rights' afforded to the aliens - eg. notification before they're moved, along with bending over backwards to not offend them, no matter what - to the point of ridiculousness. Third, the commander's choice to lead the effort - his goofball son-in-law - hardly one likely to succeed in anything other than getting himself and others killed. Yet, that would not make the commander look good at all.<br /><br />The idea for this sci-fi is somewhat original, and the special effects are amazing however gross and disturbing.  In District 9 the aliens look like giant grasshoppers, including spitting black fluid, and are attacked by humans.  The plot says they need to move further out of town and out of sight.  So a team of MNA officials go door to door having the aliens sign away their rights.  (ha-ha?)  Of course they want to stay where they are and fight humans scene after scene.  I don't think this is entertainment.  The movie also kept reminding me of the old thriller, "The Fly" where the main character is transformed into a fly. In District 9, the main character slowly turns into one of the aliens, which looks like a 7 foot bipedal grasshopper.<br /><br />A stalled spaceship over Johannesburg, South Africa brings aliens to earth for 20 years.  The film makes a racist joke of a segregated class (this time space alien)  living fenced off area outside of town - eating garbage is unimaginative.  This has been done often and in many forms.  In the film the slang word for "alien" is "prawn" - which is insulting to the aliens.<br /><br />An evil corporation, Multi-National United (MNU) is sent into District 9 to do evictions.  This makes no sense at all.  I guess this was something to laugh at.  The MNU goes to each shanty and knocks on the door asking the alien who lives there to sign a release, that they know they will be moved.  If they don't sign, they shoot them.  Huh?  The movie gets messy and messier.  It seems like the first part was more structured at least, but then the majority of the movie turns into a crazy fight that goes on and on.  Gags such as the aliens liking cat food, alien weapons can only be used by Wikus (Sharlto Copley) who plays the human who becomes half-breed.  Of course we hear jokes of making love to the "prawns" to start turning into one of them.  It also did not  make sense that the District 9 Slum was controlled by local Nigerian gangs.  Nothing added up other than more people to fight.<br /><br />So it turned into a generic action movie with special effects, some old jokes entwined, but not very entertaining, not what I wanted or expected.</p></br><a href="../users/AH1OH4PWR7NV6.html">AH1OH4PWR7NV6</a><br/><p>Odd type of movie.  This could have been a lot better.  It was not funny enough for a comedy.  Not scary enough for horor.  The news flashes were annoying.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>This is a movie I only need to see once.  It was fairly predictable, an annoying lead character who I could care less about, and stereotypical charictures of cat food dealing thugs. When it comes to brilliant sci-fi films, I think Alien and Blade Runner, District 9 suffers from the desperation of original ideas and creativity and is part of a new generation of really bad movies.  Why watch this when you can watch more mystical and magical movies of the genre that have beautiful cinematography and offer you an escape.  There were times when I thought this was a boderline comedy, not that any of the intended jokes were funny in my oppinion.  District 9 was a hot mess to watch and I would never buy this trash yet alone watch it ever again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RW7HXNEJ0QTQ.html">A2RW7HXNEJ0QTQ</a><br/><p>SPOILERS : I don't walk out on movies but this one made it necessary for many. Camera footage was very shaky and made many leave the showing I attended due to motion sickness.. On a small TV it may be less intense.. as for the movie itself ( now I am not by any means a sci-fi buff...) I enjoy a good movie.. that's it.. this movie SUCKED.. storyline was simplistic but at the same time I expected some real action to unfold which never did.. the ending, which left me ready to set the screen ablaze, left you and the movie unanswered with the hollow feeling of maybe the next movie would be better... which apparently worked for many who thought it was good.. but for me... and that's all I care about and I believe many think as I do...This Movie= very little action, poor storyline! made you constantly feel something was getting started and you are left wanting when it never does! NEXT!<br /><br />The viewer will ask these questions... how if the humans brought them down from the ship did they have and keep their weapons to trade with the cat food dealers..? ( which was a absolute joke )They were supposed to be timid... and that was the reason for them to not be worried about them using the weapons, yet many fought the police... why not with the very superior weapons they had.. no leader? not 1 to lead any to revolt ( which is what I waited for the hole time)... I could go on, but who cares.. movie had too many holes to be interesting. Add that to no real action and you get a real lame movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>Combining two genres that previously, I never thought of blending, socially-consciens and alien lifeforms, "District 9" brilliantly brings to life a gripping tale that is very realistic, but also heartbreaking all in one.<br /><br /> Featuring relatively unknown actors, "District 9" takes place in Johannesburgh, South Africa, where the legacy of Apartheid lingers on across every sector of the nation's societies, regardless of wealth or race. A large alien spacecraft parks itself above the city's skyline, and hovers over the place for many years, doing virtually nothing. To the dismay, amazement but also fear of the citizenry, a large colony of alien lifeforms, who exhibit sentience, find themselves stranded on Earth.<br /><br /> Due to fear gripping the city, the alien lifeforms are herded into slum villages with one becoming known as District 9.<br /><br /> This is a marvelous movie and one I highly recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>`District 9' was like that surprise hit of 2009, the film that no one expected to `go the distance', the one that racked up some surprising Oscar nominations (I think everyone expected that Visual Effects nomination, but Best Picture, Screenplay and Editing were pretty unexpected) and continued to astound critics and audiences alike.  I had been sitting on actually seeing this film for a while now, despite really wanting to see it.  I finally got around to seeing this the other night, and I must say that I approach this review with equal parts respect and bewilderment.<br /><br />The film is very good, but it misses greatness in my eyes.<br /><br />`District 9' references a slum that houses aliens that have landed in Johannesburg and have been populating the area for several decades.  Their mother-ship hovers ominously in the horizon, reminding the humans that the aliens are still there.  The humans have segregated the aliens, confining them to a small and disgusting area and have regarded them as nothing but trash, referring to them as `prawns'; a derogatory term used to label them bottom-feeders.  On the outset of the film we are told, in documentary form, that the aliens are about to be evicted and moved to another location.  Head of this particular assignment is Wikus Van De Merwe, a na?ve and slightly odd young man whose father-in-law obviously favors him (but doesn't truly care for him).  While serving eviction notices and checking for illegal weapons, Wikus stumbles upon a device harvesting fluids that the aliens have been working on for twenty years.  That devise infects Wikus and soon he finds himself morphing into one of the aliens.  His department tries to use him as a test experiment and when he escapes they do what they can to track him down and cover up their own negligence.  Soon he is a fugitive with nowhere to turn but the one place he doesn't want to be a part of, District 9.<br /><br />The film is smarter than your average science fiction film in that it actually roots for a human core, something that can connect it to our world and speak to a deeper message.  In fact, it attains what it is searching for, especially on the surface.  `District 9' is absorbing and provocative, and that is a great asset to have within this genre, for it sets it apart and makes the audience take notice.  The action sequences are outstanding and the visual effects are tremendous (I prefer these authenticated visuals to `Avatar's cartoonesque appearance).  And yet, with such a sharply conceived idea (contrasting alien treatment with the apartheid) the film lacks the layers it needed to make this feel more human.  I'm tired of the whole idea that evil is one-note; that it is without levels of emotion.  In `District 9' it is apparent that humans are selfish and mean and aliens are misunderstood and kindhearted.  Even after being completely stepped on and stabbed in the back by a human, one of the aliens refuses to leave him alone in the sight of danger.<br /><br />`District 9' is far too black and white for its own good.<br /><br />Despite this flaw (ugh, why did it have to be there), this film is really well thought out and expertly crafted.  Director/writer Neill Blomkamp is one to watch for, since he really has a handle on this thing.  He has created a shockingly sincere and beautifully unique science fiction film that shows extreme promise for the young director (he's only six years older than me and look at where he is in his life!!!).</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>DISTRICT 9 is a perfect blend of sci-fi, comedy, action, and adventure w/ great-looking aliens, an intriguing story (w/ nice twists), loaded w/ hilarious political satire. D9 moves at a manic pace, seeming like it's about 30 minutes long! If you enjoy a good sci-fi yarn w/ cool E.T.s and big laughs, then D9 should definitely hover your UFO...</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>As "District 9" opens, we learn that a mysterious spaceship has been hovering over Johannesburg, South Africa since 1982.  After years of trying unsuccessfully to integrate the more than a million aliens who arrived on it into regular society, government officials have decided to move them out of the slum, known as District 9, where they now reside, to District 10, a camp located far away from the city (the creatures are derisively referred to as "Prawns," due to their crustacean-like appearance).  Trouble begins when Wikus Van De Merwe, a field operator for the MNU (Multinational United), becomes exposed to a mysterious alien substance while in the process of evacuating the camp, a substance that causes him to slowly turn into a Prawn himself.  Immediately, the MNU wants to dissect him to better understand how to operate the aliens' weaponry (for some reason human DNA renders the weapons useless in human hands).  However, Wikus escapes and becomes a fugitive from justice, finally hooking up with an alien who may possibly be able to help him retrieve his full humanity.  (Though set in South Africa, the movie`s provenance is actually New Zealand).<br /><br />Shot partly in the style of a you-are-there documentary and partly as a conventional third-person narrative, this relatively low-budget ($30 million) thriller, written by Neil Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell and directed by Blomkamp, is high on creativity, raw energy and imagination and low on sci-fi movie cliches (the overused fugitive-on-the-run scenario being one of the few concessions it makes in that regard).  "District 9" also provides more food-for-thought than the average big-budget movie in this genre.  Like "Alien Nation," it uses the arrival of outer space visitors to weave a thought-provoking parable about such relevant social issues as prejudice, governmental and corporatist secrecy and propaganda, black market exploitation of the masses, and xenophobia.  The script also deviates from the standard formula by making the aliens neither pointy-headed super-intellectuals light years ahead of us in knowledge, nor unthinking villains bent on colonization and destruction, nor namby-pamby sentimentalists reaching out a hand of friendship from across the cosmos.  They are just worker drones who happened to get stranded on a strange planet, whose generally compassionate inhabitants invited them to stay on - albeit clearly as second-class citizens, as it turns out.  The movie also captures some of the poignancy of the 1986 version of "The Fly," as piece by piece, Wikus loses the one thing that defines what he is - his humanity.  Yet, ironically it is in becoming less human - in being able to more fully identify with an "other" to the point of extraordinary self-sacrifice - that he becomes most human (a theme not unlike the one in "Avatar," actually).<br /><br />Even with all its impressive CGI effects and hardware, "District 9" would not be half the movie it is without the extraordinary performance of Sharlto Copley who, as Wikus, provides the human heartbeat the picture needs to be effective.  A somewhat bumbling, barely competent bureaucrat is not an obvious choice for an action movie hero, but Copley makes that very tricky transition seem utterly natural and seamless.  Wikus is a good-hearted man who's forced by circumstances to perform actions he wouldn't normally perform just to survive, yet he remains true to his moral code most of the way through.  It is he and he alone who lifts "District 9" to the level of compelling human drama.<br /><br />Excellent special effects, exciting action sequences, some subtle social satire (particularly in the early stretches) and moments of surprising tenderness all combine to make "District 9" a one-of-a-kind moviegoing experience.</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>A mysterious alien ship appears above Johannesburg, South Africa. The aliens aboard are weak and dying, and are eventually moved to a shabby refugee camp where they are feared and misunderstood by the locals, and taken advantage of by ganglords.  Meanwhile their technology is being studied by a multinational corporation that hopes to take advantage of their advanced weaponry.  When the timid bureaucrat Wikus is charged with leading an operation to transplant the "prawns" (as they are called by the locals) to a new camp, he is inadvertently drawn into their plight.<br /><br />District 9 represents a truly inventive and exciting new voice in science fiction, that at its best tends to exploit the ideas and resources of the genre (aliens, futuristic technology, alternate realities) in order to explore present day issues, such as how we tend to fear, abuse and exploit "aliens" on our own planet.  Or how our fears can make us vulnerable, and our ignorance makes us weak.  The film challenges us to ask what it means to be human, especially when we treat other intelligent beings as "other."  It's also a thrilling film, that kept me on the edge of my seat.  I loved that the main character was not an "action star" but a timid bureaucrat, both likable in his own way and betraying the prejudices of ignorance.  This is a cleverly written and intelligent film, that plays with the conventions of science fiction genre film by merging with documentary, but without quite falling into the "Blair Witch" or "Cloverfield" style shaky cam home movie realism.  A lot of fun to watch, and left me with lots to think about.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>I haven't seen that many films that were released just last year, but there were several that I really liked, including District 9. This movie is one of the best to have come out in 2009, with perfectly good reasons. It's not a standard sci-fi picture, but rather a satire on segregation and xenophobia. It's distinctive in that it's not set in a typical metropolitan city (such as New York City or Los Angeles), but actually set in Johannesburg, South Africa. It's a pretty deep sci-fi film, and it sure does deliver. In addition to the satire and the high octane action in the last half hour, I like how the film starts as a documentary in the first half and then an action-packed adventure in the second half. But I think the strongest element in District 9 is Wikus van de Merwe, the protagonist played by Sharlto Copley. When he's first introduced, you don't seem to care about him at first. But when his life is in danger, you start to care about him. And when his life is REALLY on the line near the end, you root for him all the way. That is what I like most about this movie: you really care about those who try to survive. And despite the main villain being pretty much a cardboard cutout, District 9 is still a thought-provoking sci-fi film that offers plenty of action, adventure, drama, and even humor. It's one of the definite best films of 2009.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A3II1ACACC5MTX.html">A3II1ACACC5MTX</a><br/><p>I am as soft as melted ice cream and wont watch gory or disturbing film, and I had no problem with the level of violence portrayed in this film, so rest easy those of you with gentle dispositions.<br /><br />This film could be interpreted by some as an unsophisticated look at South Africas treatment of their minorities, and I suspect part of the reason that the film plays so well in a South African setting is how easily the humans subjugate the aliens, and what an unlikable bunch of arrogant people they collectively seemed to come across as in the film.<br /><br />Its nice to see Lethal Weapon 2's nice work in generating South Africans as your stereotypical evil race in films. Now we have Arabs, the British and South Africans taking the traditional role of the Russians prior to the break up of the cold war.<br /><br />The fact that the central character is so unlikable, and has the name Wikus (I could only think of Michael Palins Pilate in Life of Brian saying "Wikus Dickus") is a masterstroke, why should films have a likeable star just to make everyone feel all warm and lovely about themselves. Sometimes, stuff happens to those who aren't Brad Pitt or Matt Damon types and they have to deal with it as best they can.<br /><br />Also an interesting counterpoint is the fact that the black population is as enthusiastic as subjugating the aliens as the white, perhaps not seeing their own history reflected in the plight of the "Prawns", it must be remembered that the spaceship arrived in Jo'burg when Apartheid was still at its height, and some back-story perhaps integrating the arrival of the ship into the breakdown of that social system might have strengthened the story a little.<br /><br />Which brings me to my biggest gripe, the lack of back-story isn't critical in this film, but would have added a lot to my enjoyment of the film, where did they come from, why did they come to earth, why were they in such a poor state when they got here, why didn't they defend themselves against the humans with their advanced weapons?<br /><br />This is overall, however, a film about human nature, and could be transplanted across our globe and throughout our history when a dominant society subjugates a submissive one, and as such makes provoking and interesting viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>Peter Jackson may be known for his work on the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy and "King Kong" but as producer for the science fiction film "District 9', needless to say that with his name attached to this project, many people had high expectations.<br /><br />"District 9' is a film adapted from a 2005 short film "Alive in Joburg" directed by Neill Blomkamp (known for his visual effects work for "Smallville" and "Stargate-SG1') that focused on social segregation.  This time around the film (which was budged for around $30 million) would take events that took place in South Africa in District Six, Cape Town during the apartheid era but bring a sci-fi feel that features aliens instead of humans in a camp located in District 9.<br /><br />Needless to say, TriStar Pictures marketed the film virally on the Internet and despite not having any big name actors in the film, Peter Jackson's name and the teaser trailers featuring the film's awesome special effects would help in creating interest and hype a for the film  and in August 2009, "District 9' made $37 million in its opening weekend and eventually making over $204 million worldwide.  Now the film makes its entry to Blu-ray and comes loaded with many Blu-ray exclusive special features and also a digital copy of the film.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"District 9' is featured in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1) and what a gorgeous film does this film turn out to be on Blu-ray.  The film is not only vibrant and colorful, the amount of detail scene is incredible.  From the grime and dirt on Wikus and the surroundings around District 9, to the detail of the clothing and alien and human skin is incredible.  The detail of the broken down, dilapidated slums are brought to life on HD and if anything, this film looks incredible on Blu-ray!  Definitely one of the most amazing looking film to come out on Blu-ray this year from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.  This is a film that is literally "visual eye candy", "District 9' looks fantastic!<br /><br />As for audio, the lossless audio soundtrack is featured in English and French DTS-HD MA and also features an English audio description track.  And similar to the picture quality of "District 9', the lossless audio is also fantastic!  There are many action scenes in this film, so from the radio control communications which you hear on all surround channels, gun shots and alien weaponry blasting to the LFE kicking right when the spacecraft starts to move, I was very impressed.  The soundtrack really creates an immersive soundscape and the fact that all surround channels are being utilized, people who own a 7.1 or higher setup will love how "District 9' will sound on their home theater system.  Absolutely fantastic!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Hindi.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"District 9' comes with the following special features featured in High Definition and in English Stereo.  Included are:<br /><br />  * BD Exclusive: MovieIQ - If you have a Blu-ray profile 2.0 player that can connect to the Internet, MovieIQ connects you to access real-time information on the cast, music, trivia and more while watching the movie!<br />  * BD Exclusive: CineChat -If you have a Blu-ray profile 2.0 player that can connect to the Internet, you can send on-screen instant messages to your friends around the world while you watch the movie together.<br />  * BD Exclusive: Joburg From Above: Satellite and Schematics of the World of District 9 - Interactive Map - Using your remote, people can see a satellite view of District 9, the alien mothership and MNU headquarters.  When you click on one of the locations onscreen, you get detailed information and video.  Definitely a pretty cool feature for those who want to learn more about the surroundings of key areas in the film.<br />  * BD Exclusive: GOD OF WAR III playable PlayStation?3 Game Demo and unlock an exclusive making-of the game. - For those that own a Sony PlayStation 3, they can play a demo of the video game and making-of video.<br />  * Director's Commentary - Audio commentary with director/co-writer Neill Blomkamp who is giving commentary before the film came out in theaters.  What is interesting is a discussion about how polluted the area where they shot the film (slum area) with asbestos and chemicals all around.  But overall, good insight from Blomkamp and overall an informative and entertaining commentary.<br />  * Deleted Scenes - (23:26) A total of 23 deleted scenes.  The deleted scenes are actually quite good and could have added more info. to the film.  But I can understand that they were trying to reduce the time for better pacing but definitely worth watching after the film.<br />  * The Alien Agenda: A Filmmaker's Log -- Three-Part Documentary - (34:19) The documentary features how Peter Jackson chose Neill Blomkamp, the collaborative writing project with Terri Tatchell and Blomkamp, filming in South Africa and working with the film with a limited budget.  The second part features the behind-the-scenes of making "District 9' and working with the talent.  The third and final part is an interview with Blomkamp and talent during post-production.  Incorporating the sounds, CG and the special effects for the film and how they were accomplished and the challenges of editing the film between documentary and cinematic sequences.<br />  * Metamorphosis: The Transformation of Wikus - (9:52) Discussion of Wikus transformation and Sharlto Copleys experience of having to go through the various transformation.<br />  * Innovation: Acting and Improvisation - (12:04) Behind-the-scenes with how the director's worked with many actors and how the dialogue was mostly improvised.<br />  * Conception and Design: Creating the World of District 9 - (13:18) The conceptual art design and set design for the film.<br />  * Alien Generation: Visual Effects - (10:18) Creating the visual effects for the film and working on a budget.<br /><br />Note: Before the film starts, you get a menu which you can choose human or alien.  As far as I've seen, the changes are just menu driven - one featuring humans with a red color scheme with the other featuring aliens and blue color scheme.  I have not found any easter eggs or anything at this time to show anything significantly different by choosing a certain menu.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />The trailers for "District 9' may showcase the film a human vs. alien type of sci-fi film but once you start watching the film from beginning to end, you realize how many layers this film has.  It was not meant to be a political film but yet, the film uses the aliens and the segregation that took part in South Africa and so there is a deep underlying tone to the film.<br /><br />Typically when I see a Summer film or any film that is pushed virally, films such as "Cloverfield" have left me felt that there was over-reliance on CG and special effects and at first, before watching this film, I was thinking that "District 9' would be a film with not much substance but all visually eye candy.  "District 9' is visual eye candy but it's the good kind of candy that you want from a Blu-ray release.  Awesome picture and audio quality, a lot of special features and for the most part, a film that goes beyond the average "popcorn-flick" flair.<br /><br />Sure, Peter Jackson's name is attached to the film but in truth, you have to hand it to first time director Neill Blomkamp (and also screenwriter Terri Tatchell)  who adapted his short film and was expected to take that short film and make this monstrous sci-fi film with only $30 million dollars.  In contrast, to other 2009 films "G.I. Joe - Rise of Cobra" cost $170 million to make, "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" cost $200 million to make and here is a film that was shot by a first-time director, features no major stars, shot in a hazardous area, dialogue that was improvised and yes, they director and crew had to cut corners but what an amazing film "District 9' turned out to be for its low budget, considering how immense this project and film actually came to be.<br /><br />Actor Sharlto Copley (who plays Wikus Van De Merwe) who has never really acted in a major film was incredible and almost like an Ed Norton who got his first big break with "Primal Fear", "District 9' definitely puts Copley on the map and will be a talent to watch for more and more in the near future.<br /><br />Overall, "District 9' turned out to be a pretty smart and deep sci-fi film.  It definitely was not what I was expecting and that's good because it turned out to be much more fulfilling.  Is it a great film?  No.  But it's a pretty solid, thought-provoking sci-film that features a gripping screenplay, awesome special effects and also solid acting.  All from a director, crew (aside from producer Peter Jackson) and cast that we have never heard of.  An ambitious film that looks and feels like it should have cost a lot more to make but in the end, Blomkamp made it happen with a low budget.  The Blu-ray release of "District 9' actually enhanced my appreciation for this film  and in the end, I feel that this "District 9' is just too awesome of an HD  release on Blu-ray and definitely earns my recommendation!</p></br><a href="../users/AOXL514GEE4AA.html">AOXL514GEE4AA</a><br/><p>Ok, ok....I am reading the reviews here and I love the passion although some people are either too harsh or making this out to be a masterpiece! It's not either, it is a good movie with some interesting plot lines and solid acting. The special effects are excellent and when you consider the budget was fairly small it gets high merits. The movie starts off very slow and takes some time before it really turns it up! Give it a chance, it is a very good movie.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: The disc is beautiful and the sound rich. The special features are interesting and informative. Not really a 'DEMO DISC' but if you jumped to the end it can be. Worthy of ownership.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>"District 9" is a potentially great film that, unfortunately,  left its brains on the cutting room floor. A massive alien spacecraft is parked, incongruously, above Johannesburg, South Africa. After a suitable period of distant study, the government invades and discovers that the craft is filled with sickly aliens. These are promptly removed to a squalid shanty town, District 9, directly below the ship. There, the aliens prove to be ill-tempered, violence-prone neighbors for the local humans, who agitate to move them out of the city. The film follows a group of government clerks and police who seek to evict the aliens.<br /><br />The first half of the movie was filled with originality and promise. The city-sized, haze-shrouded spacecraft itself was spectacular, and CGI used to render the wasp-waisted, humanoid aliens was near perfect. Watching the South Africans attack the ship using comparatively tiny helicopters went against most films in the aliens genre, which are either filled with peace-loving kewpie dolls or invulnerable mega-warriors. The irony of watching civil servants try to extract signatures from the clicking, grunting, ever-menacing  aliens was delicious and even funny. Wikus Van De Merwe, the civil servant who led the evictions (acted by a suitably sniveling Sharlto Copley) was a narcissistic figure full of his own self-importance who was barely more tolerated by his own people than by the aliens. And the willingness of government officials to inflict torture on their own citizens  in order to procure a desired technological advantage, while undeveloped, was all too believable.<br /><br />The second half of the movie devolved into a sequence of hoary Hollywood clich&eacute;s. There was the unlikely buddy clich&eacute;, on the order of "The Defiant Ones," in which a human and an alien must work together to save themselves. An interminable chase ensues, including a session in which bad guys talk endlessly about how they will hurt our heroes. There are cute kids in danger and unrelenting hunters, etc., etc. In spite of obvious parallels between apartheid-era South Africa's brutal dislocation of blacks and the treatment of the aliens, there was surprisingly little political meat to the movie. Why a film set up this elaborate allegory of man's mistreatment of man, then chose not to pull the trigger, is a mystery that robs the film of its potential for greatness.<br /><br />Watch District 9 for the masterful acting, cool-ish weapons, writing, use of CGI and a few tantalizing good ideas. But alas, don't watch it for anything deeper.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>Most sci-fi movies about first contact with aliens are optimistic about humanity, portraying the event either as a chance for peoples of different nations to make common cause against alien enemies (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WQWPKA">Independence Day [Blu-ray</a>]) or a moment that inspires us to reach for the stars (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I9Z8G2">Star Trek VIII: First Contact</a>). While fun, most of these movies feel more like fantasy than a probable reality.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SJIO5E">District 9</a>, by contrast, takes a different approach. This movies is about a first contact from hell, in which alien refugees are corralled into slums by cynical humans. This is certainly a very, very different portrayal of first contact. The film's approach to humanity, the mix of opportunism and sheer indifference, strike me as jarringly realistic. I know it sounds crazy, but at times I though to myself: yeah, this does seem possible. This could be how it happens.<br /><br />Part of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SJIO5E">District 9</a>'s success comes from the way it was filmed. Much of the movie is filmed as if it were a documentary. Television crews accompany the hapless bureaucrat Wilkus (Sharlto Copley) as he evicts the aliens from their shacks, giving it the feel of a news report more than sci-fi/fantasy movie. The movie also interviews "experts" in alien biology and sociology, which brings audiences up to speed on the situation. At first, I was skeptical about this cinematographical technique because it sounded a bit corny, but it's actually very effective. It really helps blur the distinction between reality and the movie, allowing viewers to become totally absorbed in the story.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed that, midway through the film, it seemed to descend a bit more into a typical action flick. It never quite went too far to spoil the movie. In fact, one of the things I really loved about the movie is how the characters responded. Even during the most intense battles, when other movies would have simply focused on the big fireballs, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SJIO5E">District 9</a> has compelling moments when the various characters must make important choices.<br /><br />I thought everything else in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SJIO5E">District 9</a> was superb, from the acting to the soundtrack. The special effects were great. I loved the design of the aliens. These aren't simply giant blue people (a la  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VPE1B6">Avatar</a>). The "prawns" as they're called are alien enough that they look creepy and make you sympathize a bit with the government's decision to quarantine them. However, they also are able to convey emotions and demonstrate their intelligence and humane side.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SJIO5E">District 9</a> is easily one of the most original films I've seen this past decade. It's got the spunk, soul, and plot that films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VPE1B6">Avatar</a> simply don't possess. Highly recommended. I hope there's a sequel.<br /><br />Note: The DVD has some of the best deleted scenes I've ever seen. There is a lot of material not included in the film, including a lecture about the anatomy of the aliens.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Presented by Peter Jackson, "District 9" is a unique take on sci-fi action with character-driven story. The film begins with "documentary" footage of a huge spaceship that arrives from outer space. It appears over the city of Johannesburg and hovers there for more than 28 years. The aliens that have come with the machinery are all contained in the area "District 9." Now the government and human citizens alike want them go away.<br /><br />Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) works for a big corporation, Multi-National United. He is assigned to relocate (forcibly) the unwelcome visitors from outer space, now residents of the city's now notorious "District 9," to another place where the government promises a better life. Things go terribly wrong for bureaucratic MNU employee Wikus, however, when he stumbles upon a mysterious cylinder with black matter in it. Not exactly a bad person, but Wikus is kind of a man who always does something he is not supposed to do.<br /><br />What ensues is a tale of an unlikely hero trapped in two or more rival factions. The entertaining story is told with lots of actions and a bit of dark humor.<br /><br />Film fans may point out that some of the film's subject matters have been explored before (the 1988 film "Alien Nation" directed by Graham Baker, for instance). Sometimes science fictions with aliens from outer space can be a metaphor for immediate political issues. Director Neill Blomkamp may not be as sophisticated or psychological as, say, Don Siegel and his classic "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" - "District 9" contains considerable amount of gores and graphic violence - but the film works nonetheless, with thrilling actions and characters you care.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>I just watched "District 9" on DVD, and now kind of wish I'd seen it on the big screen. The production values are impressive and the lead actor (Copley) deserves to be nominated for a "best performance" award. But while the movie's premise - aliens stranded on Earth, herded into a grubby shantytown - offers grist for social commentary, the pacing is slow at the start and the story deteriorates into "Transformers" style blow-em-up action near the end. Definitely a cut or two above average, but its flaws keep it from earning five stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AKS9SJTHTU0OM.html">AKS9SJTHTU0OM</a><br/><p>Blomkamp does the amazing by combing roller coaster excitement with an intelligent context that makes all the noise about something.<br />While some of the ideas are occasionally heavy handed or on the nose, it's so exciting to see a Hollywood action film that traffics in ideas,<br />that I'm willing to forgive the occasional 'I get it already' moment, or logic lapse, or easy coincidence, or mediocre supporting performance.<br /><br />The story is simple. A million plus grotesque looking, starving and sickly aliens get stranded on Earth when they essentially run out of<br />fuel. And while at first humans try to reach out in friendship, before long corporations are trying to make money by exploiting their<br />technology (especially, or course, their weapons) and the aliens are herded into a 'district' and walled in. (That the film is set in South<br />Africa is one of those choices that feels like gilding the lily - even though that is the film-maker's home). And it's clear that progressing<br />from apartheid to Nazi style medical experiments and concentration camps is the next step.<br /><br />While I wish the villains were less mustache twirling (some 'banality of evil' would have been even more chilling), the effects are great,<br />and it's a film that grew, not shrank as it went along. For the first third I thought it was OK, the second pretty good, and by the end I<br />loved it.  And it's stuck with me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKMQFL05Z79K.html">A3GKMQFL05Z79K</a><br/><p>District 9 is a 2009 South African science fiction thriller film directed by Neill Blomkamp. It was written by Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell, and produced by Peter Jackson and Carolynne Cunningham. The film stars Sharlto Copley, Jason Cope, and David James. The story, adapted from Alive in Joburg, is a 2005 short film directed by Blomkamp and produced by Sharlto Copley and Simon Hansen.<br /><br />The story, itself, is about a large alien aircraft that stops above Johannesburg, South Africa in 1982. When an investigative team enters the ship, they find lifeforms on board starving and malnourished.  The aliens, often referred to as "prawns", are confined to District 9(a government camp just underneath the ship). Unrest occurs between the aliens and the locals which pushes the South African government to hire Multinational United (MNU), a private military company, to relocate the aliens to a new internment camp. Wikus van de Merwe is appointed to lead the camp relocation by serving the aliens with eviction notices. Meanwhile, alien Christopher Johnson, his son, and an alien friend search for alien technology from which they distill a mysterious fluid, storing it in a small canister. While raiding the shack of Christopher's friend, Wikus discovers and seizes the container, which sprays the fluid onto his face. Unfortunately, it slowly begins mutating Wikus into a prawn. This is where the real story begins.<br /><br />I have to admit, this isn't your typical sci-fi movie about aliens. What I liked most about the movie is the fact that it dealt with very real situations. My only dislike about the film is that it mostly was marred by mindless explosions and whatnot that seemed to take away from the real story beneath it all. Even though it seemed more like a political movie, it wasn't by any means. It did have its' flaws. For the most part, however, District 9 is a decent film.</p></br></body></html>

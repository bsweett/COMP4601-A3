Kirk and company still have to return to earth and face court  martial for violations of Starfleet regulations.Whale special effects are  incredible as well.Kudos to Nimoy for an outstanding directorial effort.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>A space probe is approaching earth. Its requests are causing great havoc. They can not be answered. That is unless Kirk and his crew can go back in time to fetch the intended parties.<br /><br />Of all of the post series original movies, this one captures the essence of the series best. Yes it carries an important message, as that is the purpose of sci-fi. The technology is consistent with the series. And the charters conform to type.<br /><br />But what makes this movie stand out is the character interaction. You have seen it many times in episodes like [Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 28: "The City on the Edge of Forever" (1966).] Oh, you say that was history but it was also love, not humor. O.K. how about "Spocko" and Kirk trying to drive in the twenties [Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 49: "A Piece of the Action" (1966).] Yes you say there are exceptions but it would never happen on the enterprise. What little you know. [Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 42: "The Trouble with Tribbles" (1966)] and there are quite a few more examples.<br /><br />I will not bring up all the fun scenes as it is more fun to watch them unfold. There is a lot of trivia that make this film interesting. What I found interesting was the scenes at the Institute in Alameda, because I was there and it is really the Monterey aquarium.<br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Now as with all major and a few minor films, we have the Blu-ray high definition revolution. By the time, you read this review Blu-ray is the norm so I will not regurgitate the technical details.<br /><br />However, you can see all kinds of details as the differences in Kirk's hair firm top to bottom, and someone wearing shoulder pads that are indicative of the 80's.</p></br><a href="../users/AMG2LF8MLUDN1.html">AMG2LF8MLUDN1</a><br/><p>This is probably by far the funniest of the Star Trek motion pictures.  The crew of the Enterprise has found Spock and are trying to get home when they receive a signal from earth telling them to stay away because of the impending doom of the planet.  Of course this is how Kirk gets out of the dog house (in the previous film he disobeyed Star Fleet orders and stole a starship to look for Spock) because as we all know, he's the only one that can save the earth.  An alien probe has returned to earth to communicate with hump backed whales.  The problem is that they are extinct on the earth of the future.  Unbeknownst to the probe, its communications begin to destroy earth's atmosphere and the weather goes nuts and 100% cloud cover prevents the sun's rays from reaching the earth.<br /><br />So where do you get these whales for the probe to communicate with?  From earth of the past of course.  So sets the premise for the film.  The laughs are mostly due to Mr. Spock not being quite himself and also from the fact that the crew has had to return to earth of the past in a Klingon Bird of Prey (with the cloaking device).<br /><br />Yes there is a message here.  Take care of the earth or it won't be able to take care of you!<br /><br />Some would say the story is far fetched but it's science fiction.  It's supposed to be far fetched.  The kids will love it even if they don't know Star Trek.  There's no nudity and no real foul language.  Also you won't find much violence either.  This film is kid friendly.<br /><br />Go ahead and purchase with confidence.  May the force be with you! (oops, wrong scifi series!!)  Live long and prosper.  Enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z9FXHC1L66EW.html">A2Z9FXHC1L66EW</a><br/><p>Let me begin by stating that Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home was the first S.T. film I saw in the movie theaters.  This wasn't by choice, however.  When Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan came out in theaters I was only seven  years old and my dad said it was too violent for me to see (I know! ).  Sadly the DVD version is the first time I ever saw it in the widescreen  format. Before that it was always the pan an scan video with the cool boxed  pictures of the film as the cover art.  I have read many reviews about both  films and there seems to be a huge debate over which of these excellent  films is the best Trek of all.  I really like them both immensely and even  though, to me, it feels like Part II has the majority vote I must go with  the minority and say that Part IV is the best.  Again, please understand  that doesn't mean that II is not wonderful.  It is.  I'd give it 4 and a  half out of 5 stars.  But IV gets all 5.  Maybe it is because it was the  first one I saw on the big screen.  There was a great atmosphere and the  place was packed.  In fact everytime I go see a S.T. film there's this bond  I feel with the other audience members that you don't feel when you see  most films.  Every punchline got huge laughs.  It was like we were all  friends.  I have always enjoyed the lighter side of Star Trek.  The Trouble  With Tribbles comes to mind immediately.  It was so funny making a little  furry round animal into this menace that constantly multiply when given  food.  Why should you always have to take yourself seriously?  In fact  that's one reason why I watch Part IV more often than II...it's more  relaxing. And I mean that in a good way.  Nobody dies in this movie, unlike  Part II where many people are killed.  Don't get me wrong.  I love action  and sci-fi put together (The Matrix)but they really do suck the energy  right out of you.  The concept of an alien probe coming to earth seeking to  communicate with humpback whales but to no avail since they've assumedly  been extinct and in the process knocking out all main power to anything it  comes in contact with may seem outrageous to some.  I think it was a nice  way of saying if we don't stop killing off species one day it's gonna come  back and bite us in the butt.  Leonard Nimoy called it an &quot;Ecological  house of cards&quot; in the director featurette on the DVD.  One day we  could pull a keystone card and the whole house will fall down.  The whales  by the way looked incredible.  Until I got the DVD I had no idea that only  5% of the whale shots were real and the rest weren't.  The dialogue with  the cast is terrific and I really enjoyed the fact that Spock wasn't fully  himself and that he still needed time to find out who he was and how he  felt.  You could sense that with his attempted use of &quot;colorful  metaphors&quot; and such.  Oh and that crowd cheered forever when he gave  that punk on the bus the Vulcan neck pinch for playing his radio loudly.  In this film Kirk got to be Mr. Romantic again, the way many remember him  from the television series.  Charming, witty but a bit clueless at times  (L.D.S.?).  The dinner scene was his best as he's trying to persuade  Gillian to give him the whale's as his communicator goes off and he tells  Scottie to tell Uhura and Chekov &quot;Phaser's on stun, good luck, Kirk  out&quot; with this goofy look of embarrassment on his face that works so  well.  Everyone has an important task to finish: McCoy and Scottie getting  the glass walls to hold the whales in and paying for them by giving the  owner info on transparant alumminum (&quot;Is it worth somethin' to ya or  should I just punch up clear?&quot;), Sulu must get a helicopter to  transport the walls (I still wonder how he stole it...perhaps he put his  communicator inside when he was talking to that guy and they beamed it  somewhere else later..who knows..it doesn't matter), and Uhura and Chekov  have to get energy to recharge the Klingon dillithium crystals by stealing  them from a nuclear &quot;wessel&quot; called, oddly enough, the  Enterprise.  Chekov's interrogation scene is hilarious.  Not a single  weapon is fired with the exception of a harpoon which gets deflected by the  Bird of Prey.  The rescue of Chekov gives McCoy his best scenes, giving a  woman a pill that grows her a new kidney and mixing words with 20th century  doctors (&quot;We're dealing with medievalism here&quot;) and the way in  which they escape the hospital was outstanding (I love the frantic pace).  After the whales are saved and beamed up it's another sling shot around the  sun (anyone remember when they first tried it on TV in the episode  &quot;Tomorrow Is Yesterday&quot;)?  As you can tell I love this film.  I  only wish they had done another like this with the original crew.  I know  the majority will still say Star Trek II, which by the way has one major  flaw in that Khan could not have recognized Chekov (he was not yet a member  of the Enterprise crew during Episode #24, Space Seed, which I like to  watch before putting in Part II. Chekov's first appearence was Episode #30,  Catspaw (The Star Trek Encyclopedia))is the best film. But for me Star Trek  IV: The Voyage Home stands tallest in the end.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>Of all the Star Trek movies, this is probably one of the best and one of the few to make an impact with a wide audience (only <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00078XGRO">Star Trek - First Contact</a> compares). The plotline is funny, uplifting, and memorable. Having seen Humpback Whales in the wild, I also appreciate the movie's message - that in harming our environment, we are harming ourselves.<br /><br />With that said, Star Trek IV is tough to follow if you aren't at least somewhat familiar with the Trek universe. This movie especially picks up near the end of a story arc, so it doesn't take time at the beginning to introduce the characters or Trek universe.<br /><br />Another problem - special effects really are dated. The Klingon Bird of Prey on Vulcan is obviously a painting - a good painting, but a painting nonetheless. While I'm not crazy about the idea of going back and adding computer generated special effects a la the Star Wars Special Editions, Star Trek IV could have used touchups and better-looking ships in a few places. Fortunately, this movie (unlike some of the later Treks) was not about special effects, but rather a heartwarming story.<br /><br />Humpback Whale populations are on the upswing now. I think in some small way, Star Trek IV helped international efforts toward protecting whales.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ARJ16772TKHT.html">A3ARJ16772TKHT</a><br/><p>Who would have thought that getting home from a planet lightyears away would be such a hassle? Following only months on the heels of Star Trek III, this movie starts with our beloved crew on Vulcan with a Klingon cruiser. However, before they can get home, they decide to take a quick detour to the late 20th century to, quite literally, save the whales.<br /><br />Hokey oversimplification of the plot aside, this is actually a very solid entry to the pantheon of Trekdom. While there are some who take issue with the overtness of the ecological message (Trek is usually better at hiding its agendas) there is plenty here for everyone to enjoy. In fact, when it came out in Europe, it was billed as "The Voyage Home - Star Trek IV", not even playing up the fact that it is a star trek movie at all. In the end it became one of the most commercially successful of all Star Trek movies (as of this writing).<br /><br />Granted, commercial success does not prove greatness. (I would point out that the first Star Trek movie was a financial success.) In this case however, it is a good indication. In the best Star Trek tradition, there is drama, there is humor, there is action and (of course) there are aliens about to literally destroy the earth until Kirk and crew intervene and send them packing.<br /><br />Great fun and a wonderful DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>A gigantic alien probe that sends strange whale-like sounds to 23rd century Earth is causing major disasters, only Admirel Kirk (William Shatner), Spock (Leonard Nimoy), Sulu (George Takei), Chekvov (William Koenig), Scotty (James Doohan and Commander Urha (Nichelle Nichols) can go back in time to San Francisco 1986 where they must find two Humpback Whales so they can take them back to the 23rd century so they can use the Whales's calls to stop the probe.<br /><br />Vastly entertaining, sometimes funny and stylish entry of the franchise! Co-starring Catherine Hicks and Michael Barryman ("The Original Hills Have Eyes"), this is one of the best movies of the popular Sci-fi movie series. The direction by Leonard Nimoy is very good and it has humor such as the memorable and hilarious scene where Spock confronts a punk using the Vulcan neck-pinch, excellent special effects, good acting and how the Enterprise crew are trying to get along well in the 80's especially good pacing. It's a wonderful finale to the Trilogy that started with Star Trek II and ended nicely with this one, i strongly recommend this movie for fans of ST, sci-fi and even the whole family for some intergalactic fun.<br /><br />This 2-Disc DVD Collector's Edition has excellent picture and sound with some great extras like an audio commentary from Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner, Text commentary from Michael and Denise Okuda co-authors of the Star Trek Encyclopedia. Featurettes, Tributes, Storyboards, Production Gallery, Interviews and Trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EBHHCZO6V2A4.html">A3EBHHCZO6V2A4</a><br/><p>"The Voyage Home" shows old school Star Trek at its best. There's plenty of suspense, humor, and the crew having a "fish out of water" experience...on 20th century Earth. It has the bonus of an environmental message-without being heavy-handed or hating humanity.<br /><br />"Voyage Home" begins with a probe circling the Earth-reminiscent of ST:The Motion Picture. Thankfully,it's not V'ger. It is transmitting a strange message to the oceans. It turns out to be--whales! The Enterprise has to go back in time to get humpback whales. The crew goes back to 20th century San Francisco. Kirk confronts punk rockers,and explains Spock with "he did a lot of LDS." They go the Monterey Bay Aquarium, where they meet a perky oceanographer (played by future 7th Heaven pastor's wife,Catherine Hicks) The romance between Kirk and the oceanographer is natural and humorous. It flows naturally from the story instead of feeling forced. Of course,there's a happy ending, the planet is saved, and the oceanographer goes back to the future with the Enterprise crew.<br /><br />"Voyage Home" is a fun,uplifting film. It's a Star Trek voyage worth taking!</p></br><a href="../users/A3ADUOVTY3TIRU.html">A3ADUOVTY3TIRU</a><br/><p>I remember watching this in the theatre when it first came out and now that all the films are available on DVD I have been steadily collecting them..This is one of the best in that it has a fantastic commentary by William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy that offers quite a bit of insight into the making of the film! This film has quite a bit of humor..more so than the earlier and subsequent films..I think this made the film a lot more fun and gave us more of a glimpse into the characters and chemistry among the original cast..I think Nimoy did a fine job of directing the film and from what I understand this film was one of the bigger successes of the 6 films..no wonder..it's a classic! Like many of TOS episodes I feel the producers and directors of the films wanted a lasting testament to the ideals that Gene Roddenberry first crafted in his original stories..they did a fine job! The DVD quality is excellent and the audio is amazing!</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>Two Discs packed with entertainment information, and an extremely good time.<br />Nicholas Meyer wrote part of this Film, and despite that short coming, :-), it is great; you get to discover which parts he wrote too !!! And surprise, surprise, both Meyer and Shatner  agree on one thing, the use of Time Travel as a device is not that great. However, its very good fun in this film.<br />Nimoy once again shows his brilliance as a director in what I believe is his third directorship, and maybe fourth( but not in thje STAR TREK Universe). He correctly picks some significant changes in the stories edge, and manages to safely create one of the most popular films in the STAR TREK film series.<br />The features on disc 2 are brilliant, and the detailed Tribute to Mark Lenard  is awesome !!! Some of the discussions may be a bit too much for some, but the loads of extras is more than enough to justify the cost, even with the disc one audio and video quality, as well as a DVD  menu that is way better than STAR TREK VI ( the only  other one in this series I have seen so far), the icing is on the cake.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>As I explain in all of my Star Trek reviews, a good rule to remember with the Star Trek motion pictures is to watch only the even numbered ones (2, 4, and 6) and avoid the odd numbered ones (1, 3, and 5.) The even-numbered ones are extremely good while the odd ones (except for the first film which is rather average) are extremely bad. This continuation of Star Trek 2 and 3 directed by Leonard Nimoy himself is a pleasant viewing experience with a great screenplay, decent acting, and good special effects. A film worth owning or at least watching several times.<br /><br /> Our famous Federation crew starts on Vulcan where Spock has been re-educated in his Vulcan ways after coming back to life on the Genesis planet in Star Trek III. He was of course dispatched in Star Trek II while fighting Kahn. Deprived of the Enterprise, the crew takes off to Earth in their Klingon bird of prey but are interrupted by a mysterious space monolith that is disrupting the Earth's oceans. The Earth is on the verge of destruction and our heroes must go back to 20th century Earth to find the answer. Once on Earth, the crew is in total culture shock with their ancestors' primitive ways. Their mission is soon helped with the reserved guidance of a marine biologist (Catherine Hicks.) Will they come back to the Earth of the future in time to save humanity?<br /><br /> This plot is not the action-drama that pervades Star Trek II and VI. Instead, this is more of a science fiction-adventure-comedy with little to no dramatic tension at all. I wouldn't worry too much about the link with Star Trek III because it's simply better to avoid watching that horrible film and accept that Spock just came back to life. A very pleasant film to watch with plenty of comical cultural contrasts between future and past characters and situations; not to mention the perpetual clash of views between Spock and McCoy: &quot;You green-blooded inhuman.&quot; Leonard Nimoy directed this film quite well and the actors are comfortable in their roles. A fun film for the entire family.</p></br><a href="../users/AZDVOFC2MTIM5.html">AZDVOFC2MTIM5</a><br/><p>Like The Trouble With Tribbles,IV may not be the best(II tops them all),but it's certainly many fans favorite.<br /><br />  What makes this film work is its humor as well as its warmth and heart.The cast look like they're having so much fun filming it, that it rubs off on the audience.Equally funny is seeing our beloved crew of the USS Enterprise,looking awkward and out of place in the 20th century.<br /><br /> The movie is also fast paced as many obsticles(the Klingon Crystal depletion,the search for the whales in the ocean as well as the hospital scenes)pile up upon one another yet successfully resolving themselves.Subsequent film that try to replicate IV's formula end up looking clumsy(V and Insurrection)because they miss the point that behind great comedy is heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G8IR6ENZSQHF.html">A2G8IR6ENZSQHF</a><br/><p>The premise of &quot;Star Trek: The Voyage Home&quot; probably doesn't sound promising to those who haven't seen it- the Enterprise and the crew travel back to the present day to retrieve a pair of humpback whales.  It's a welcome surprise then that &quot;The Voyage Home&quot; proves to be one of the most entertaining Star Trek entries; it's both interesting and funny, if a little low on tension.<p>Director Leonard Nimoy handles this situation perfectly.  The &quot;fish-out-of-water&quot; story had grown old even when this movie was released in 1986, but it's still a riot to watch the Enterprise crew try to adapt to late 20th century San Francisco.  There's also a good ecological message from &quot;The Voyage Home&quot;- if man continues to be short-sighted in his dealings with the environment, he may inadvertently destroy himself.  There's not many major characters in the film outside of the Enterprise crew, but Catherine Hicks shows flair as a marine biologist that's trying to help out Kirk and Co.<p>The only thing that's missing from &quot;The Voyage Home&quot; is tension.  There's no real villain and never really a sense that things won't turn out all right in the end.  One could argue that the series needed to lighten up a bit after the dark and violent second and third entries, but it still sometimes feel that something's missing from &quot;The Voyage Home&quot;.<p>Overall, this is a very entertaining movie, and one of the few &quot;Star Trek&quot; films that can appeal to a wide audience outside of its target one.  Considering the quality of some of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; films that followed it (&quot;The Final Frontier&quot;, &quot;Generations&quot;), &quot;The Voyage Home&quot; is definetely a quality Trek outing.  If you don't own it yet, what are you waiting for?</p></br><a href="../users/AOVJYIUATQKR5.html">AOVJYIUATQKR5</a><br/><p>Star Trek movie rank 3rd of 10.

The storyline may sound flat on paper, but thanks to a smart and humerous script, capable directing from Leonard Nimoy, and the great chemistry between the Trek crew (and the interaction between them and the San Francisco of 1986), this installment is undoubtadly the most fun and entertaining in the series.  The film was a phenominal hit when released, and paved the way for more sequels to come.  The Special Edition DVD is worth noting as well; the commentary from Nimoy and William Shatner is a must hear for any Trekkie, and the production featurettes on the making of the film are actually very interesting.  Next to The Wrath of Khan Director's Edition DVD, this is Paramount's best DVD edition of a Star Trek film.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ1H3VLCDR298.html">AZ1H3VLCDR298</a><br/><p>Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is the considered to be the best trek film, and for good reason. After 2 dark films, this one is a light comic fantasy, with great character interaction and laugh-out-loud situations the characters find themselves in. But I am here to review the DVD, so you all can make an intellegent decision on whether to buy it or not. The ONLY feature is a documentary that you can find on the VHS version, so there is nothing new here. The only reason I can think of for Trek fans to shell out their wallets on this is because of digital picture. The sound quality is not that good either, it sounds much better on the Wrath of Khan DVD. Hopefully Paramount will release a more loaded version later, but now if you already own this on VHS it won't be a major improvement.</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>With many fans disappointed following the release of the third &quot;Star Trek&quot; film in 1984, &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot;, Paramount Pictures produced one of the best &quot;Star Trek&quot; films of all time in 1986: &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;.  Returning to the director's chair for what was only his second directorship of a big-screen motion picture was Leonard Nimoy, but this time, Nimoy had much better material to work with from the films many writers.  Nimoy (who actually took on-screen credit for writing) worked with returning writer Harve Bennett to write a brilliant story, and Bennett worked on the screenplay along with three additional writers: Steve Meerson, Peter Krikes and Nicholas Meyer (who directed the highly successful &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn&quot; in 1982).  Under the watchful eye of Gene Roddenberry, these men were able to recapture the spirit of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series more than any other preceding or proceeding &quot;Star Trek&quot; film.<p>Having restored Spock's (Leonard Nimoy) life via the Genesis planet and a return to the planet Vulcan during the third film, the crew of the lost U.S.S. Enterprise now waits on Vulcan for repairs on their captured Klingon scout-class ship, as well as for Spock to retrain his mind, before returning to Earth to face various charges for having disobeyed orders.  The crew includes Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy (DeForest Kelley), Commander Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott (James Doohan), Commader Hikaru Sulu (George Takei), Commander Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Commander Uhura (Nichelle Nichols).  The Klingons are also very angry with Kirk as expressed by the Klingon Ambassador (John Schuck) to the Federation President (Robert Ellenstein) in front of the full Federation Council, but the cool logic of Vulcan Ambassador Sarek (Mark Lenard) prevails.  While on Vulcan, Spock gets to spend time with his human mother, Amanda (Jane Wyatt, who once played his mother in the 1967 &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series episode &quot;Journey to Babel&quot;).  Also, a brief appearance is made by Lt. Saavic (Robin Curtis), who unfortunately never returns in any other &quot;Star Trek&quot; film.  With their Klingon ship ready for departure, Spock and his Enterprise shipmates begin their voyage to Earth; but unknown to them, a bizarre space probe also en route for Earth has been wreaking havoc on any ship that approaches it.  Arriving at Earth first, the probe turns Earth's atmosphere into chaos as it waits for a signal that the Federation cannot discern.  Receiving a planetary distress call from Earth, Spock identifies what the probe wants: communication with long extinct whales.  To save Earth, Kirk makes the decision for them to travel back in time to bring back whales to the present.<p>&quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; has more memorable scenes than could be mentioned here, but some of the best include: McCoy's conversations with Spock, the crew on the streets of twentieth-century San Francisco, Uhura and Chekov looking for nuclear vessels, McCoy and Scotty visiting the production facility, Kirk &amp; Spock on a city bus, Kirk &amp; Spock's conversations with Dr. Gillian Taylor (Catherine Hicks), Kirk's dinner with Gillian, and McCoy with Kirk &amp; Gillian at the city hospital.  Everyone's acting (including Shatner) was very good for this film, but what makes this film stand out from the rest is the emphasis on all of the original crew members.  Each of the crew members have time on screen, contribute to the story and have a reasonable amount of dialog.  Other familiar &quot;Star Trek&quot; characters have cameos in the film: Dr. Christine Chapel (Majel Barrett) and Janice Rand (Grace Lee Whitney).  Another cast member in this film who later plays a pivotal role in the sixth &quot;Star Trek&quot; film is Admiral Cartwright (Brock Peters).<p>Overall, my rating of for &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; is a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  This film, along with the 1982 film &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn&quot; and the later 1996 film &quot;Star Trek VIII: First Contact&quot;, are the three best films ever made of the franchise; but this film will always stand out as being the most humorous, having the best &amp; most memorable dialog and having the greatest spirit of the three.  I highly recommend it to everyone who, in any form, has liked &quot;Star Trek&quot;.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>Star Trek IV The Voyage Home, in my opinion, is clearly one of the best out of the TOS six.  Although not as high in the suspense aspect, like Leonard Nimoy says, it was good to lighten up a bit and have a good time with Star Trek.  While other reviewers might feel the humurous aspects of this film wearout after repeated viewings. I understand that statement, but don't feel the same.  I can still get a laugh out of these scenes even though I've seen them more times than I can remember.  I especially love the scene with Scotty being handed a mouse and him trying to talk to it.  Again, one of the best Star Trek films out of the original six.  If you're one of the few people who've not seen this or are new to the genre, I definitely suggest you add this DVD to your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JJOV69MAU2J2.html">A1JJOV69MAU2J2</a><br/><p>This is the Trek movie that even people who don't like Trek movies enjoy. A heartwarming if preposterous tale that has our intrepid crew going back in time to 1986 to find some whales, who it turns out, are the key to saving the world circa 2282, this fun frolic in San Fran has tons of laughs, great interplay among the cast and lots of campy but good moments.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things<br />*Some good special effects.  Some of it is quite memorable.<br />*Filming style is good.<br />*Storyline is great; an interesting departure from the story-arc of the last two films that ties everything together nicely.<br />*Characters are still good.  You get to learn one or two more things about them all.  Good acting.<br />*This is mostly a comedy, so there are loads of funny scenes.  Lots of memorable dialogue.  Good writing.<br />*Strong themes about the environment and saving the whales from extinction.<br />*Music is good (uses a different, more upbeat theme).<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Ummm...<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*It almost seems too different in a way; can be good or bad.<br /><br />This is definately the funniest and most light-hearted of the bunch.  Aside from the continuing "Star Trek" storyline and a number of great special effects, the story is dominated largely by hilarious dialogue and scenes as the crew travels back in time and tries to fit into an urban environment.  On top of it all, it has some  very strong messages about preserving our environment.  Altogether, it'll leave you smiling.<br /><br />The one-disc version had okay video and sound quality.  The two-disc version has good quality and a number of featurettes and trailers.</p></br><a href="../users/A12A8LU93A132U.html">A12A8LU93A132U</a><br/><p>This is my favorite Star Trek film. The characters satirize themselves and it has an interesting story. The picture and sound are excellent. The featurette is an excellent 'making of' feature that runs about 30 minutes.  Nimoy gives some interesting information on the making of the film. I think  this is a must DVD in any sci-fi fans' collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4.html">A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4</a><br/><p>Leonard Nimoy lent his genious talent in directing this truly epic and succesful film in the Star Trek movie series and a favorite period among the fans of the almost 35 year old franchise and even among the people who  saw it that weren't fans love it , it is as much everything that Star Trek  it self is making you laugh while at the same time being emotional and  serious and the one thing that is most famous about Star Trek old friends ,  that we know so well back together for another big<p>journey and this on is  no acception as it proves to be there most challenging of this gallant  crew.<p>  The federation is in complete chaos as a sudden unanswerable  probe that they seemingly can't stop or answer is threatning the entire  world and draining it dry , the answer lies with the crew to try and find a  solution to answer this probe.They find the answer in the probes language  they figure out that the probe can be answerd by the sounds of Humpback  whales but in there time period the whales have been extinct for a very  long time ,  Spock suggest that the answer would be to travel  into the  past to 20th century and attemt to find Humback whales but when they do the  surrounding prove to be even more challenging to them then  mission itself  as they confront punk rockers  bus fare and exact change and pizza they  seemingly confront these things in a way that Leonard Nimoy does that makes  you laugh because they never know whats going to happen in this time and  there reactions are so rediculous that you wanna crack up.<p>  The answer  lies in finding these whales with a  fiery female marine biologist who  cares for the whales very deeply and distrusts the Admiral but when she  discovers that the whales have been shipped out to take there chances on  there own she askes for the Admirals help in getting the whales to a safe  place so they will never be in danger but there journey of finding them and  getting them back safely will prove to be far more difficult than they  could ever imagined.<p>  For any Star Trek fan this is the coolest Star  Trek DVD it shows you a feturette in the making of this truly incredible  masterpeice its a must have for any Star Trek fan and an incredible  legendary Star Trek film.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>The beginning of this VHS treats you to a preview of the upcoming new tv series, STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION (1987-94).<br />  This film also is dedicated to the crew of the space shuttle Challenger who exploded 73 seconds after take-off on January 28, 1986.<br /><br />Leonard Nimoy is the director of this film.<br /><br />The Ambassador of Klingons (John Shuck) is upset with James T. Kirk and the Genesis project.  Sarek (Mark Lenard) attends the trial to defend Admiral Kirk.<br />  Currently, their is a probe from an unknown source in space that is causing phenomenal weather conditions in Juno, Alaska and San Francisco, California where Starfleet is based.  The probe is vaporizing the ocean.<br />  Stardate: 8390: Spock has had three months of Vulcan exile.  Spock (Leonard Nimoy) is taking a computer exam.  When asked, "How do you feel?", Spock does not know how to answer.  Spock's mother, Amanda (Jane Wyatt) explains to her son, his human feelings for the crew of the Enterprise.  Spock returns to command, however McCoy (DeForest Kelley) has some misgivings about Spock that he might not have all of his bearings yet.  The Enterprise crew has decided to return to Earth in the Klingon spaceship since Starfleet cannot send a ship. The Enterprise ship, their home, had to be abandoned and was destroyed. By a timed destruction, they saved their lives.  They must find a way to tranmit to the probe to stop its avenge.  The tranmission signals the probe which is releasing a whale song. It needs a reply.<br />  The Enterprise crew, along with Scotty (James Doohan), Chekov (Walter Koenig), Sulu (George Takei) and Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), must travel back to the 21rst Century to find humpback whales and bring them into the 23rd Century to reply with the probe.  At warp speed 9.8, they end up at 20th Century Earth.  They follow a whale signal and they land in San Francisco, California in the Golden Gate Park.  It is 1986.  Kirk and Spock find a whale biologist, Gillian (Catherine Hicks) that will be of some help to them.<br />  Also in the cast: Robin Curtis, Majel Barrett, Grace Lee Whitney, Vijay Amritraj, Madge Sinclair, Michael Berryman, Joe Lando, Brock Peters, Robert Ellenstein.<br />  This is my least favorite Star Trek film, however, I did enjoy the comic relief of our beloved Enterprise cast abd Catherine Hicks was a "seventh heaven" to look at.  Always nice to see Jane Wyatt.<br /><br />  Jane Wyatt played Spock's mother, Amanda, in the original STAR TREk tv series, Season 2, episode #10, "Journey To Babel" with Mark Lenard as "Sarek" in 1967.<br /><br />The next year after this film, a new tv series, STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION, premiered on the UPN Network in 1987, introducing a new crew to the Enterprise, set 60 years after Kirk's original reign as Captain.  DeForest Kelley returned  as Dr. McCoy as the oldest living crew member, in the pilot episodes.  Majel Barrett, Mark Lenard and Leonard Nimoy would later appear in the tv series.<br /><br />  The next film is: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305350205">Star Trek V - The Final Frontier</a> (1989).<br /><br /> Followed by:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305252599">Star Trek VI - The Undiscovered Country</a> (1991).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002HDOB8">Star Trek - Generations (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a> (1994).<br /><br />The cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987-94) took over the movie franchise.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305127638">Star Trek - First Contact</a> (1996).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000ILBK">Star Trek - Insurrection</a> (1998).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008O0WN">Star Trek - Nemesis (Full Screen Edition)</a> (2002).<br /><br />The original STAR TREK characters (1966-69, 1979-94) were explored again in<br />STAR TREK (2009).<br /><br />***Update: STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS will be released May 17, 2013.</p></br><a href="../users/A16YCLRKOU0EV3.html">A16YCLRKOU0EV3</a><br/><p>This is the highest grossing Star Trek movie to date, and for good reason. It's funny, and has a socially-conscious theme. I just wish they included the Director's Edition interview with Leonard Nimoy from the first dvd release.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TUZOJZM9008Y.html">A3TUZOJZM9008Y</a><br/><p>Everyone else seems to love this movie. For me, it was alright. The classic fish-out-of-water tale gets the Star Trek treatment as the intrepid crew heads to 20th century San Francisco so that they can look silly. Director Leonard Nimoy, who also helped develop the story, spares no one in his none-to-subtle &quot;save the whales&quot; movie.<p>Star Trek has always been great when they take social issues of today and transform them into a science fiction realm. This one translates the science fiction into the social issue of today, with mixed results. Everyone is given something to do, unfortunately, that helps to point up the lack of ability many of the original crew possess acting wise.<p>A good movie, witty but not subtle.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W3HLHIA9UP4D.html">A2W3HLHIA9UP4D</a><br/><p>I can understand what the writers of Star Trek IV were trying to do: Make a film more lighter and yet create an epic adventure. In theory, this sounds good, but with a plot like this one, I can't say I'm happy with the overall result. Now, don't get me wrong, back in the day, there were pretty crazy plots in the original Star Trek series. Need I mention Season 3's "Spock's Brain"? I'll spare re-telling the whole story of this film, undoubtly, you already know it from other reviews, but in a nutshell, the crew has to go back in time to get extinct humpback whales or the future Planet earth is destroyed. If you think that's funny, note that all of this is determined by the crew by themselves in oh...about a minute and half!!!! Basically, this plot just seems so over-the-top dumb, espeically for a major motion picture that includes a bigger audience rather than just the die hard Star Trek fans who would probably enjoy the movie if the story was about the crew having a slumber party. I can't believe that many fans are calling this film the best in the series. The saving grace of this film is the humor. There are some great scenes with Kirk and Spock, as well as Scotty, in then present-day San Fran. doing their best "fish out of water" routines. Really good humor, I must admit. But maybe someone should have spent a little more time on the overall STORY of the film rather than just adding humor. It's almost like they wrote the story specifically for humor, rather than just writing a good story and injecting humor in it. Hey, if you want to add humor, add some humor. If you want time travel, go for it, I'm all for time travel..but whales?? Give me a break....to quote the movie, I think someone took "too much LDS" when they were writing the script!</p></br><a href="../users/AB0GGIQBNB36Q.html">AB0GGIQBNB36Q</a><br/><p>I too am surprised at the glowing reviews of this movie, while the time travel theory isn't bad. The reason is, To save the whales. Really?!, Really?!, this is the only even numbered star trek Movie that isn't good. It opens up with an alien probe traveling through space, cutting the power of every ship and space station it passes. When it stops by earth, obviously it causes trouble. bringing storms, all the while giving off a sound, that no one can interpret. But, on Vulcan, Kirk and his merry band have decided to turn themselves in to the federation. Oh, i didn't mention the trial at the begining, where the Klingons want the federation to hold Kirk accountable for the death of the Klingons in the previous movie, despite the fact that those Klingons were violating there own rules. But I digress, on the way home, with Spock on board. They pick up the signal from earth, warning all ships to stay away. And they hear the probe, and Ding ding ding, spock figures out with a computer that it's a whale song, and now the movie reaches it's message, that because in the 80's we killed off all the whales. It becomes a saving the whales and the planet message, so much that cathrine hick's character while giving a tour, goes off on a tagent about whaling, and what whalers have done. And how bad those companies are, I understand what this movie was trying to do, but the execution of that story was bad. For example, after they rescue the whales from the villains of the story, the whalers. They go back to their time, crash the ship in the ocean set the whales loose. And they are able to communicate with the probe, and voila the probe is satisfied, and leaves. just like that, now at the end Kirk is reduced to captain. I do own this movie, and I have tried to like this movie. But, it badly misses the mark. Again, I know what they wanted to do. Buuuut, the execution left alot to be desired.</p></br><a href="../users/A5QE86H97FDJA.html">A5QE86H97FDJA</a><br/><p>This Trek film could have been titled, &quot;Star Trek IV: Attack of the Alien Whales&quot;.<p>Why are there so many films and episodes where an unstoppable force heads right for Earth and nothing seems to be able to stop it? Why? Because the writers have so very little creativity left in them after writing so many stories over the years.<p>This film was written specifically to bring the plight of the whales to mainstream audiences through a light-hearted Star Trek film. Yes, there are a few laughs, but this is just a sign that Star Trek has become nothing more than a joke. This concept may appeal to Trekkies (which is why ST: 5 was only appealing to Trekkies and universally hated by any other human trapped inside the theater) but it serves to damage the franchise further. The end result was that the last ST film basically bombed at the theater.<p>So, yes, you can trace the loss of Star Trek's appeal to films like this one. <p>As for the special effects, there are very few at all. There was one weird sequence when the crew was traveling back in time, which had to be the dumbest segment in sci-fi history.<p>If you really feel you need to see this film, watch it for the laughs, not for the sci-fi value, because there is little to none of that.</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>Without question, this has to rank alongside &quot;The Trouble With Tribbles&quot; as a classic example of &quot;Star Trek&quot; humor featuring the original series cast. I'd dare say it's even funnier. I never thought either William Shatner or Leonard Nimoy would be brilliant comedians, yet their humorous portrayals of Kirk and Spock are quite convincing. You'll burst out laughing hearing Kirk's and Spock's reaction to contemporary coarse American language (And there is a scene involving Spock on a San Francisco bus that is absolutely priceless.). The supporting cast, including Original Series regulars DeForest Kelley, Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei and James Doohan make much of their relatively brief time on the screen. Catherine Hicks is credible as the 20th Century cetacean biologist romanced by Admiral James T. Kirk. I credit the film's writers, including Nicholas Meyer, for allowing the original cast to boldly go where they rarely went before, with respect to humor. It's certainly among my favorite films in the ongoing &quot;Star Trek&quot; series.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H22I2RWE0HOV.html">A2H22I2RWE0HOV</a><br/><p>As time moved on for the aging crew of the Starship Enterprise and its fanbase was also growing older and more(dare I say it!) sophisticated  (on a purely geeky scale, of course) the producers decided it was time to start turning away from the sheer-fan aspect of the gene-pool and try and find other targets in the demographical arena that was middle class America.  Namely, the kiddies.  Now, what kid wanted to watch a bunch of old geezers up on the silver screen acting all sci-fi and cool?  Not many.  I was 16 when Star Trek IV came out and I gotta tell ya, another Star Trek movie wasn't high on my list of priorities unless the ticket for the theatre was hidden in the bra of a 16 year old girl.  So the old dudes started doing a lot more one-liners than before.  The surly Dr. McCoy as a regular stand-up comedian.  Spock was the naive sraight-man to most of the jokes.  It was funny.  They were making fun of things that we could relate to.<br /><br />Earth is under attack by some weird cylindrical probe which is vaporizing the oceans and blotting out the sun.  All systems have crashed in the wake of the probe's sheer power.  Earth is doomed.  In their exile on Vulcan with the recently resurrected Spock, the outlaw crew of Enterprise decide it's time to head home and face the music for their actions.  They Sabotaged another starship, disobeyed orders, and destroyed The Enterprise.  Court-martial?  Definitely.  On they way back to Earth they get the distress call. Avoid Earth at all costs!  Spock, having listened to the transmssion the probe is sending, deciphers that the message cannot be answered because it is intended for Humpback whales and they are extinct in the 24th century.  Ooops!  Back in time they head!  Earth!  1986!  San Francisco!  The calmities begin there.<br /><br />Of all the Star Trek flicks, this is probably the funniest. Not the most intriguing, certainly not the worst, either  (Search For Spock gets that award or Generations).  I prefer Wrath Of Khan.  But it is fun to watch.  Deadpan humor.  A look back at the mid-80s.  Worth a look every now and again. Nimoy directs.<br /><br />Dig It!</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>Don't buy this edition!

So far, this is the best of the series. I had so much fun!<br /><br />For one thing, the captured Klingon ship is the only thing available for the crew of the Enterprise to get home from Vulcan. (Just in case you haven't seen the third one yet, I won't tell you why they were on Vulcan, or how they captured the Klingon ship.) As they approach Earth, they find there is a major crisis going on. There is some alien probe disrupting all energy sources and communications, and the President of the Federation orders them not to dock, because it is too dangerous.<br /><br />Spock really demonstrates some excellent guessing in this one. First, he speculates that the reason the probe is stirring up the oceans is that it is trying to communicate with someone or something which it expects to find in the water. So Kirk asks Uhura to modify the signal it is putting out to how it would sound under the ocean. She does, and it sounds like whales. Specifically, humpback whales. Problem is, they have been extinct for some hundred years or more.<br /><br />So the crew decides their only hope is to go back in time to the "late 20th century" (presumably 1986) to try to find some humpback whales, carry them forward to the time when the alien probe is screwing everything up, and see if they can communicate with the aliens.<br /><br />So a good part of the story is the amusement value of these 23rd century people trying to fake it in a 20th century version of San Francisco -- and Sausalito, where the cetacean research center is where George and Gracie, the humpback whales, reside. In fact, I was living in San Francisco right up until 1986; they were filming in 1985, actually, while I was there.<br /><br />One of the most amusing situations is when Uhura and Chekhov go looking for a nuclear reactor to "steal some protons" (I think it was) at the Alameda Naval Base. Chekhov, with his thick Russian accent, gives the security people some real problems.<br /><br />But the bottom line is they manage to bring the whales back and the whales save the planet. Incidentally, they are no longer extinct, because Gracie is pregnant. Whether whales can repopulate the oceans with just one breeding couple is not discussed; presumably they can get cloned if necessary.<br /><br />I had a great time with this one, played quite a bit more for laughs than the earlier movies.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>Though Star Trek: The Original Series is probably best known for its diverse cast of characters and mind-bending storylines, many fans of the show consider the comedic-style episodes of the show to be paramount to all others, as they allow the main characters to emote in non-formulaic fashions (remember Sulu brandishing a rapier, Spock hanging from a tree, or the Easter bunny in "Shore Leave"?).<br /><br />Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is a throwback to that style of episode.  The film is bookended by moments of seriousness (which keep the film from falling too far outside the Star Trek cannon), but the meat of the story is hilarity all around!<br /><br />The movie begins with the U.S.S. Enterprise crew heading back home (in a Romulan warship) to face the criminal charges stemming from Captain Kirk's decision to destroy the Enterprise.  On the way back to Starfleet, however, the crew finds that the world is in great peril and set off back in time (to twentieth-century San Francisco) to make things right.<br /><br />While in Frisco, the chaos (and hilarity!) begins.  Whether it is Kirk and Spock trying to fit in among the locals, Scotty deciphering old computer technology, or Chekhov trying to find his "nuclear wessels", non-stop laughs abound.<br /><br />When the Enterprise crew finally does return to Starfleet, the scene that follows is one of the most uplifting moments in the entire Star Trek cannon, effectively ending the Star Trek II-IV movie "trilogy" and giving the show new life in the future.<br /><br />To conclude, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is a rousing film filled with non-stop laughs.  Though not as serious as all the other "Original Series" films, this movie has been embraced more than any other for its ability to lampoon both present and future cultures alike.  If you just finished watching Star Trek III: The Search for Spock and are not in the mood for any more gut-wrenching scenes, this is the breathe of fresh air you need!</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>A commercial and critical success, 1986's "Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home" has a simple premise: The principal crew of the starship Enterprise must travel back in time to retrieve a couple of whales in order to communicate with an alien probe that is causing climactic devastation to Earth.<br /><br />The actors, after having known their respective characters for over a quarter century (at the time of the film's production), could perform these roles blindfolded.  They immerse themselves into them and are believable, although Walter Koenig's Russian accent, as Chekow, has always been a bit forced.<br /><br />That said, the second disc is filled with something for the fan, non-fan, and the individual interested in a film's production.  Two fond tributes are offered: one on Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and another on character actor Mark Lenard ("Sarak").  On the former, Gene's son Eugene recalls times with his dad and these recollections are quite revealing and entertaining.  The latter is a loving homage to the multitalented Lenard by his surviving wife and two daughters.<br /><br />Fascinating info on the science behind the film's storyline, a "Vulcan primer," and a look at the special effects are also presented.<br /><br />But, the most "insightful" bonus is a look at "Kirk's women." Four actresses (Louise Sorel, Celeste Yarnell, Katherine Browne, and Catherine Hicks) recall what it was like to appear on the series or the theatrical films.<br /><br />They also talk about working with Shatner and Nimoy, which makes for some interesting comparisons.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>A lot of fun is to be had with this installment in the Star Trek movie series. There is nothing like watching people from the future travel back in time to around this time period and try to interact with people of the past. That is exactly what this movie is about as Kirk and the crew go back in time to the late 20th century to retrieve some whales that are extinct in their future. Obviously, this movie is hilarious, which is what is intended. But, this also teaches us a leason that we need to be more careful on what we do now because it does effect our future.<br /><br />The story really does add the comedy touch to what could be considered a serious topic of whale extinction. There are many moments that Trek and non-Trek fans alike can enjoy just because of the fun nature of the entire movie. From Spock swimming with whales to Chekov asking actual people who didn't know they were being filmed where the "nuclear wessels" were. If you are a fan, you have to see this movie. This is a must have once again for anyone who loves great films.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>With three successful movies (only 2 really worth mentioning), the `Star Trek' franchise was ready to branch out and try to expand its fan base beyond the hardcore Trekkies.  With that thought in mind, Paramount Pictures commissioned Harve Bennett and Nicholas Meyer (director of "Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan") to begin writing the next installment.  Also back for the sequel would be the director of "Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock", Leonard Nimoy who just so happened to be the actor who has portrayed Spock since the original TV series.  Along with Nimoy and the writers, Paramount Pictures was smart enough to realize that this franchise would be nothing if they didn't get the entire cast and crew back together again, and this time enticing them to return would prove much easier especially with the promise of this film being totally different from what has been done before.  Thus, "Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home" was born.<br /><br />After defeating Khan and finding their once dead, now resurrected friend Spock, Admiral Kirk (William Shatner) and the rest of the starship Enterprise are finally approaching Earth and spacedock so that the Enterprise may be decommissioned once and for all.  However, before they can reach their final destination an alien entity is threatening Earth by evaporating the oceans and destroying the atmosphere.  In a desperate attempt to stop this threat and save mankind, Kirk and his crew must travel back in time, to the year 1986, in order to find the solution that will cause the entity to be satisfied in whatever its search entails, and move on to another planet or star system.  But time is running out, and the solution is proving difficult to come by, especially since the Enterprise has still not been fully repaired from its recent battles (as depicted in the previous two films), so will Earth in the 23rd Century be saved, or will the time-displaced heroes learn to cope with their new surroundings.<br /><br />"Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home" served as an excellent example of exactly what to do to make sure a franchise does not become stagnate in its storytelling capabilities.  The writers, along with director and star Leonard Nimoy, were very crafty in terms of infusing the story with deeply emotional beats throughout the overall story, and infusing more humor than there has ever been in a `Star Trek' movie to date.  Many times placing too much humor in a franchise that had previously only had very little can prove to be detrimental to the series' longevity and success ("Superman 3" and "Batman & Robin" are two prime examples), however the creators of this film were careful not to get too carried away with the humor and risk losing touch with their core audience of Trekkies.  Sure there were some Trekkies that were somewhat disappointed with the film's storyline, even some of the actors were skeptical, mostly because time travel is such a touchy subject for movies, and generally feels like a cheap ploy for the writer to use to get him or herself out of a corner that they've painted themselves into.  But this was not the case here, and regardless of what some fans say, "Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home" is one of the more popular, and profitable films in the franchise, as it accomplished what previous installments and even some of the subsequent installments failed to do, expand upon the core audience and make the movie appeal to almost everybody.<br /><br />The acting was still very well done, all of the cast did an excellent job with handling the fish-out-of-water aspects that the storyline required, and it was clear that they were all loving every minute of it.  Of course, that was probably aided by the fact that their director was also their close friend and colleague, Leonard Nimoy, who shows that he was not merely a flash in the pan after his first directorial effort in the `Star Trek' universe with "Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock", and with this film he showed that he not only had the knack for drama and sci-fi action/adventure, but also knew how to bring broad strokes of humor into the story without it feeling heavy-handed or out of place.  The special effects were all relatively well done, especially for the time, and most hold up well to this day, of course this was another area where Nimoy chose to change things up in the franchise, by not making the movie be overly loaded with special effects but instead be more character driven.  A choice that I'm confident assisted in the mass appeal of the film, and allowed the franchise to continue to flourish for years to come.<br /><br />Overall, "Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home" stands out as one of the better sequels in the franchise, and possibly one of the best examples of branching out in terms of any sci-fi franchise.  If you are a fan of the series in any way, or merely looking for a good blend of sci-fi, action, humor, and drama then look no further, and the beautiful thing is you really don't need much of the backstory that had been setup in the previous films, although it would help in some areas, but even without it you could still enjoy the movie.  This is one `Star Trek' film the entire family can enjoy, yes even the ladies will enjoy this one.<br /><br />"Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home" is rated PG for language.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI.html">A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI</a><br/><p>After the death of Spock and Kirk's son (not to mention the demise of the Enterprise), the tone of the Star Trek films was growing dark. And so, it was definitely time to "lighten up!" It was no wonder that movie goers packed the theatres to see "The Voyage Home", which became the most successful Trek film (so far). It's a film which reaches a wide audience with the message: you don't have to be familiar with all the Trek trappings to enjoy it.<br /><br />Opening with the appearance of a mysterious alien probe--and Kirk & crew preparing to depart Vulcan in their newly-acquired Klingon ship to face the consequences of their actions back on Earth--the probe's transmissions are so overwhelming that any vessel approaching is rendered instantly powerless (and helpless). Once arriving at Earth, the probe "innocently" begins to ionize the atmosphere as it attempts to communicate. But with whom? Spock concludes that the messages are not meant for man, but for whales. And since whales no longer exist in the 23rd century, the crew must risk time travel to find whales in the past and bring them to their own time to respond to the probe before it destroys Earth. (Got all that, so far?)<br /><br />What begins as a serious story turns into a lighthearted "fish-out-of-water" (pardon the pun!) farce once the crew clashes with 20th-century culture, circa 1986, San Francisco. Kirk & Spock soon clash themselves with a whale biologist, Dr. Gillian Taylor, played with feistiness & likability by Catherine Hicks. Hicks blends humor, exasperation, and flirtation in her scenes with Kirk & Spock, as she tries frustratingly to figure out who these odd men are, and why they're so interested in her whales, George & Gracie.<br /><br />As Leonard Nimoy did with "The Search for Spock", he allows each crew member to have some great moments: imagine Checkov wandering the streets of Frisco asking about the "nuclear wessels?" Or McCoy & Scotty tempting a plastics manufacturer with the recipe for transparent aluminum in exchange for materials to build a whale tank? Or Spock administering the Vulcan nerve pinch to an unruly punk rocker on a bus?<br /><br />Nimoy surpasses his previous directorial effort with this one, so fresh & original in its storyline that it's hard to resist. With a strong ecological message at the center---when "man destroys other creatures, he's destroying his future"---Nimoy manages to deliver that message without making it seem heavy-handed.<br /><br />And the Bird of Prey is such a fascinating ship that the absence of the Enterprise was hardly missed. The Bird of Prey is an impressive creation, with the out-stretched neck of a vulture and wings which can move in a "defensive" posture when going in for the kill.<br /><br />As mentioned, there are several subplots happening as each "team" tries to accomplish their task. However, the delightful subplot of Spock attempting to get back in touch with his human side by way of "guesses" and "colorful metaphors" is quite amusing.<br /><br />This is easily one of the best of the series; it belongs next to "The Wrath of Khan" as a fun & satisfying adventure.</p></br><a href="../users/A31RM5QU797HPJ.html">A31RM5QU797HPJ</a><br/><p>Admiral Kirk--or should I say CAPTAIN Kirk--and the rest of the Enterprise crew go back in time to save the world in the 23rd century.  How do they save the world?  By bringing two humpback whales into the future to talk to a probe in space that is destorying the Earth.<br /><br />  This is my favorite "classic Trek" movies. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but that's what makes it enjoyable.  This also stars Catherine Hicks from "7th Heaven"</p></br><a href="../users/AL4MKKO24563R.html">AL4MKKO24563R</a><br/><p>I have several friends who acted as if I had grown another head when I said that Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home was my favorite Star Trek film. Star Trek II had the epic battle between Khan and Kirk as well as the (supposed) death of Mr. Spock. Star Trek VI had a great whodunit mystery and the final sendoff of the original crew. Star Trek VIII: First Contact had the inspiring story of how the Next Generation crew saved postwar Earth from the Borg and thus helped humankind begin its idealistic journey towards the foundation of Starfleet. Star Trek IV, however, "just had a bunch of whales and a lot of dumb humor." They said that the latter quality was especially out of place since the original series was so serious in tone. And that's where I had them.<br /><br />True fans of the original series know that it had loads of humor. From Spock and Dr. McCoy's verbal battles to Kirk getting buried under tons of tribbles to Kirk and Spock's impersonation of old Chicago gangsters to the Enterprise crew's tangles with Harry Mudd, the series was rife with comic relief that made the characters all the more appealing. Even the most serious episodes had moments of humor. For example, in the classic City on the Edge of Forever, when Kirk and Spock travel back to New York City circa 1930, Kirk must try to explain Spock's appearance to a police officer. He explains that Spock is Chinese and that his ears are the result of getting his head caught in a rice picker. The scene is hilarious and works beautifully even within the very serious story line.<br /><br />That's why Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home works so well. It has an entertaining story that even non-Star Trek fans can enjoy. But it still remains faithful to the tone and character of the original show. Gene Roddenberry and crew brilliantly addressed problems in modern society through the use of science fiction. In this case, the crew of the Enterprise must counter 20th Century man's short sightedness by retrieving two humpback whales -- which are extinct in the 23rd Century -- so they can communicate with an alien probe that will destroy the Earth unless it can communicate with the whales. As Spock says, "To hunt a series to extinction is illogical." The audience can't help but agree.<br /><br />But Leonard Nimoy, who directed and co-wrote the screenplay, does not beat the audience over the head with the message. The previous two films were very heavy and serious in nature, so Nimoy opts for a light touch reminiscent of episodes like "The Trouble with Tribbles," "I, Mudd" and "A Piece of the Action" from the original series. Kirk and company must deal with hostile traffic in 1986 San Francisco, bus drivers demanding exact change, punk rockers with 40 decibel boom boxes, an ornery female marine biologist and other hazards of the 20th Century. After watching Spock's death, the Enterprise crew's mutiny against Starfleet, the death of Kirk's son and the destruction of the Enterprise, the jovial, humorous tone of this film is a welcome change.<br /><br />Naturally Star Trek fans will get the most out of the film. When Spock's father Sarek (Mark Lenard) and mother Amanda (Jane Wyatt) appear, a dedicated Trekker can't help but remember the great episode "Journey to Babel" where we learned of Spock's complicated and often hostile relationship with his father. And when we see the brand new Enterprise at the end of the film, only Star Trek fans can truly appreciate what a happy moment it is.<br /><br />But the fact that this film was the most commercially successful of the series -- over $100 million in 1986 -- shows that general audiences and not just Star Trek fans found the film entertaining and appealing. Roger Ebert, who was very lukewarm about most of the other entries in the series, raved about The Voyage Home. Star Trek fans have always seen the films as surrogate family reunions. The actors playing the characters may have aged and gained weight, but the fans loved seeing Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu and Chekov return for another adventure. Star Trek IV, however, allows even non Trekkers to enjoy the reunion.</p></br><a href="../users/A29SJTG21BVWF4.html">A29SJTG21BVWF4</a><br/><p>As the contining adventures of those 23rd century characters, who wind up having to save the Earth once again.  But this time we find that an unheard of alien ship comes out of no-where to find out what happened to the Humback whales on the planet Earth.  And if they don't answer then it spells the doom of Earth itself.  Great acting, directing, and script run this movie up to the category of GREAT.  A must see movie for all non-Trekkie fans and Trekkie fans alike.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>The nice thing about the original Trek series and films is that they supported a variety of genres from action to comedy. For every "The Trouble with Tribbles" there was a "City on the Edge of Forever" or "Mantrap". Trek IV falls into the former category. While the film starts off with a serious threat (a McGuffin almost worthy of Hitchcock--an alien threatening the world because there's no one there that speaks its language!), the differences between men and women from the future and those living in the 80's creates a lot of potential for comedic hijinks.<p>A mysterious alien probe has entered the solar system sending out a message that Starfleet can't decode or respond to. The atmosphere of Earth is being thorn apart in response. The crew of the Enterprise in their captured Klingon ship receive an urgent message from the Earth to avoid the planet. Spock deciphers the message and realizes why there's no one to answer; it's whalesong. The only solution available (since Whales are extinct) is to go to 20th Century Earth and obtain whales and return to the future.<p>The premise is ripe with comic possibilities and director Leonard Nimoy takes advantage of every one of them. It's not the best Trek film but it is the most popular because it's so accessible (it also grossed the most at the box office for the original Trek films). All the actors are clearly having a blast with the next to last of the quartet of interrelated films (The Undiscovered Country refers back to 2 and 3's back story and has a light connection to 4 as well). <p>The newly remastered edition is a huge step up from the previous edition. The anamorphic widescreen transfer is much sharper and clearer than the previous edition. The sound mix, while not as good as a current release, uses the 5.1 surround sound format very well. The great picture and sound are augmented by cool extras. You get extras galore. Nimoy's director's commentary and the Trek text commentary provide interesting distractions the third or fourth time you watch the film. The text commentary is filled with bits of trivia, points out production gaffes and has some very funny observations about the film, the crew and the Trek universe.<p>The extras on disc two includes a moving tribute to actor Mark Lenard. Unfortunately, there aren't any clips from other television programs he appeared on (like "Planet of the Apes")or movies but we do get personal photos as well as a moving rememberence by his two daughters and wife. The production featurettes aren't quite as exhaustive as some of the other DVD sets (ST:TMP springs to mind)but are interesting particularly the section on visual effects that discusses the time travel sequence. Storyboards are also included (although it might have been more interesting to put them on disc one where they could be compared to the finished sequences).<p>I'm hoping that Paramount upgrades The Next Generation DVDs with as much care. While Nemesis has some fine extras, it could have been done better. Generations has absolutely nothing beyond the film (and a rather tepid transfer at that) while First Contact only has the trailers. Insurrection similarly has the trailer plus a standard productin featurette. Regardless of how you feel about the films, Paramount needs to do more value added stuff for the Trek fan base. The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyage have much better extras than any of the Next Generation films (or the original series for that matter).<p>Each of the films have their strengths and weakenesses and while there's some minor plot contrivances, they don't harm the entertainment value of Trek IV. For a good time call Captain Kirk and crew. They'll keep you entertained with this installment of the Trek franchise.</p></br><a href="../users/AFOK05KDCHSHL.html">AFOK05KDCHSHL</a><br/><p>STAR TREK IV: THE VOYAGE HOME<br /><br />(USA - 1986)<br /><br />Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)<br />Theatrical soundtrack: 6-track Dolby Stereo<br /><br />The fourth instalment in a series initiated by STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE in 1979, this glorious confection opens with joyous, celebratory theme music by veteran composer Leonard Rosenman, setting an appropriate tone for the entire film. In the words of director Leonard Nimoy, "Trek IV" is a 'caper', an old-fashioned fish-out-of-water scenario in which the crew of the 'Enterprise' travel backwards in time to 1986 to capture a pair of humpbacked whales (extinct in their own era), the only creatures capable of answering the signal from a monstrous, towering probe which is orbiting 23rd century Earth and causing havoc on a worldwide scale. The ecological message may simply be a by-product of the clever script, but it underlines the narrative at every turn, making serious what might otherwise have been little more than a lightweight, throwaway entry in the long-running franchise.<br /><br />Though Kirk, Spock and McCoy necessarily hog the limelight, as usual, all of the secondary characters - Scotty, Uhura, Chekov and Sulu - play a vital role in the development of the story, and each one contributes a substantial element to the overall structure. It's good to see these hugely talented (and frankly under-appreciated) supporting players finally given an opportunity to strut their stuff on the big screen, and the results are by turns funny, dramatic and quietly moving. Favorite bits: Scotty's hilarious 'interaction' with a 20th century computer; and something which happens in the closing minutes before the end titles, surely one of the most rapturous, spine-tingling moments in the entire history of the Trek phenomenon. Poignantly, and without any trace of irony, this otherwise joyful movie is dedicated to the crew of the space shuttle Challenger which met with disaster in 1986.<br /><br />By the way, UK prints of this movie open with a brief recap of events in Trek II and III (running 3m 30s) which is completely absent from the American version.<br /><br />Followed by STAR TREK V: THE FINAL FRONTIER (1989).</p></br><a href="../users/A1B8HI3VREI1H3.html">A1B8HI3VREI1H3</a><br/><p>Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home(1986) picks up where Star Trek III: The Search for Spock(1984) left off. The crew of the late Starship Enterprise travel to Earth from Vulcan in a stolen Klingon Bird of Prey. Back on Earth, a space probe is draining their power sources and ionizing their atmosphere. Through logic and reason, Spock finds out that the probe is trying to communicate with the extinct species of humpback whales. The Enterprise crew must time travel to 20th Century Earth to find humpbacked whales. On Earth, Admiral Kirk becomes friends with biologist Gillian Taylor(Catherine Hicks). There's a neat scene where Uhura and Chekov find the naval vessel, U.S.S. Enterprise. Star Trek IV was a big critical and commercial hit. It appealled to non-Trekkers and it has a lot of fish out of water, situation comedy. There's a scene where a rude guy with a boombox gives Kirk the middle finger! At one time, Eddie Murphy was almost cast as the biologist, but he was working on The Golden Child(1986) at the time. The music score by the late Leonard Rosenman was quite good. Star Trek IV contains references to Star Trek episodes and the older Star Trek movies. Director Leonard Nimoy claims that stories about Greenpeace gave him inspiration for the plot. The visual effects by ILM were pretty solid for 1986. Star Trek The Next Generation debuted on television a year later in 1987! The Star Trek franchise regained its mojo at the time. Star Trek IV has some early attempts at CGI as Admiral Kirk has a trippy, surreal dream. The film's happy ending is a surprise I'll leave for you guys.<br />Live long and prosper.</p></br><a href="../users/A15U64VGUV6RBF.html">A15U64VGUV6RBF</a><br/><p>It's nice to see all the classic Star Trek movies on DVD. They look and sound great, but now I wish I'd held out for the Blu-ray versions.</p></br><a href="../users/A25UZ7MA72SMKM.html">A25UZ7MA72SMKM</a><br/><p>After the first three Star Trek films, where the producers tried hard to push the series into a modern age of special effects, with varying results, they finally settled down and did a Star Trek film that matched the stories that made Trek so popular in the first place. "Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home", of the six "Original Series" films, takes me back to what it was like to see a new Star Trek episode when I watched them in the 60s.<br /><br />Even though the fate of planet Earth in the future rode on the success of Kirk and crew's mission to the past, the movie didn't have a serious tone. There was plenty of the light comedy and entertaining character interaction that made Kirk, Spock, Bones, and Scotty such beloved characters in the first place. Sulu, Uhura, and Chekov round things out, and after all, these seven were what made the TV series popular.<br /><br />The overall plot is almost irrelevant. Sure, the Earth is threatened with total destruction (again). Sure, the Enterprise crew goes back in time (again). Sure, of course Kirk and company save the day (again). But all of that is just a vehicle to get the stars we came to respect and the characters we came to love on the screen interacting in amusing and entertaining ways. We have Kirk charming a woman. We have Spock as dizzily out of touch with slang as in "A Piece of the Action". We have Scotty mastering the areas of technology, yet failing to comprehend a computer "mouse". We have a truce between a concerned Bones and a reemerging Spock, yet still with an entertaining interaction between them. Chekov's session of being questioned by Naval officers is hilarious, and would have pleased Abbot and Costello.<br /><br />Instead of "The Voyage Home" you could virtually name this movie "The Trouble with Whales". In this case the problem is not too many tribbles, but too few whales. And the story should keep us humble. Here, Earth, technologically advanced in so many ways, and the Capitol of the United Federation of Planets, is helpless before the arrival of a yet more advanced technology from the endless depths of deep space. Not even the Borg would want to mess with this baby ... and if they'd found and assimilated a world of intelligent whales, once this probe came across them the Borg problem would have been solved the easy way. LOL Yet the probe is not of evil intent, just interested in finding the species it had been assigned to be caretaker.<br /><br />This is Star Trek as I grew to love it, and I thank the people responsible for giving me a look back through the same magic mirror through which I saw the series in the 60s.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>Star Trek IV takes a bit of the last film and a bit from the first one.  We have alien invasion, an environmental message about the destruction of whales as a species and Man as well.  We learn a lot more about Spock (as he becomes re-educated after his ordeal on the Genesis planet, last film) and time travel!<br /><br />Lots of fun lines in this one.  Only whales can communicate with a probe that sucks energy from anything in its vicinity and proceeds to evaporate the Earth's oceans.  The problem is that there are no more whales.  The Enterprise zips into the past (in a dubious fling around the sun -- as an aside, whenever some sci-fi films deal with time travel, they will go into the past by going the opposite direction of a rotating star or planet, ala Superman, but I digress), in an attempt to get whales from the past and bring them into their present.<br /><br />Trouble is, the Enterprise crew is on the lam, having stolen a Klingon ship (from an earlier film).  What to do?<br /><br />So they sail into 1986 San Francisco where the area is as alien as any galactic planet they've ever been to.  We hear Kirk with his double-damn on you in crossing a street, Spock giving a nerve pinch to a boom box Goth kid (the theater audience I watched the film with cheered at that) and trying to figure out what exact change means.<br /><br />San Francisco treats like landing in Golden Gate Park ("don't forget where we parked"), the fictional whale institute in Sausalito (and our enjoyable one and only visit with the biological scientist Catherine Hicks) and Chekov's discovery of the "nuclear wessels."<br /><br />Directed by Leonard Nimoy, and story by Nimoy and Bennett.<br /><br />Has the charm and humor of the old TV series.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3USRUCHAOC3MT.html">A3USRUCHAOC3MT</a><br/><p>This is a lot lighter hearted than the previous movies of the Star Trek series.  It continues the story started in "The Wrath Of Khan", but it is a unique movie.  Both this and the previous one were directed by Leonard Nimoy, but there is nothing in common between the two pictures aside from the director and the cast.<br /><br />A lot has been made of the "Save The Whales" theme of this picture.  It also, though, shows why Trekkies love Star Trek.  True, we enjoy the imagination of science fiction, but the best part is the characters and their interaction.  Can anything match Russian Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Uhara (Nichelle Nichols) on the streets of San Francisco asking where the nuclear weapons were?  Or Scotty (James Doohan) making a deal with a businessman for some plexiglass?  Or Spock (Nimoy) asking if it was time for another colorful metaphor?<br /><br />This movie does have the worst language of any of the Star Trek movies, but in context it is easy to laugh at even if you disapprove.  I would highly recommend this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>Great digital remastering of the best of the first five &quot;Trek&quot; films and, finally, a 2nd Disc of &quot;Awesome&quot; special features, not just boring interviews.

When they encounter a mysterious probe in their travels, they decipher it to realize that it is actually the song of a humpback whale. They travel back to Earth to San  Francisco, where we have some of the greatest moments between Kirk and Spock as they travel in San Francisco in search of the woman who is trying to save the whales from being extinct. The crew of the Enterprise comes together to save the humpbacks and it brings some good action into the film, but this is more about the human interaction between the characters in the film, and not so much about the action. It's a refreshing approach, and it gives the film a lot of strength.<p>STAR TREK IV: The Voyage Home is a thoroughly enjoyable film from beginning to end, with a better premise and more enjoyable plot then the film to follow. Consider this: The Voyage Home is considered the best film in the Trek series, but I believe that honor goes to The Wrath of Khan.

Nimoy's second turn at directing is more imaginative than his first Trek, even if this one suffers occasionally from stock characters and a case of the "cutes." Star Trek IV delivers on most fronts--good dialogue, decent special effects, competent acting. The plot is recycled sci-fi: Kirk and crew timewarp to save Earth from a menace that's never quite explained or explored. Along the way, they deliver a heavy-handed message about ecology and have some misadventures. Leonard Rosenman's asymetric score will make you pine for Goldsmith and Horner, and Catherine Hicks is at times grating and juvenile, but there's some genuine warmth here. Widescreen also makes this look like a movie, rather than a big TV show. Basically completes a story that took three films and five years to finish.</p></br></body></html>

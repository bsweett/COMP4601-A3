It brings the story to life that was once a children's book by the same man who brought you Jumanji. Tom hanks played great dual roles. It's exciting, fresh, and, most importnatly, it's good clean fun wrapped in a heart of a bow.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>I sat down to watch this on DVD with my five-year-old granddaughter, not expecting very much because of the general poverty (in my opinion) of most kid's animated films. On the other hand, I'm a librarian and I'm aware of the high regard in which Chris Van Allsburg's book is held by children's librarians. And I confess I was impressed -- mostly -- with how well the film carried out the art and action of the book. It's not a "straight" animation, in that it uses 3D motion-capture techniques to give the characters lifelike movements. Tom Hanks does a surprisingly good job voicing the conductor and Santa and all the other adult males, even if he can't sing worth a damn. And, having grown up around railroaders, I loved the details of the train itself. On the other hand, my granddaughter was very uneasy during the vertiginous runaway-train scenes. I know a lot of animated-film fans hated this movie, but it wasn't bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I do not believe that there are any books that are so sacred that they should not be made into a movie.  But I did have some reservations about bringing Chris Van Allsburg's delightful picture book "The Polar Express" to the big screen as a computer animated film for two reasons.  The first is that half the charm of the original are Van Allsburg's exquisite pencil drawings.  I knew there would be something lost in the transformation from black & white to color.  The second is that the other half of the story's charm comes from the simple story it tells and unlike the massive amount of cuts that had to be made to bring "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" to the screen" writer-director Roger Zemeckis had to add a whole lot to the original story.  This risks losing the simple message in all the dancing waiters and train rides across the ice.  What I would have loved to have seen would be a half-hour television special, shown without commercial interruption, where CGI is used to preserve the look of the original (to wit, this generation's version of "The Snowman").<br /><br />That being said, this version of "The Polar Express" is delightful in its own way even if you do not find it to be as magical as the book.  The story is of a young boy who has reached the age of doubt, where he is about to decided that Santa Claus is not real.  That is when the Polar Express arrives at his door and he discovers he has a ticket in his pocket (not the pocket with the hole in it but the other one), a magical train that will take him to the North Pole to find out the truth for himself (when the train appears out of a cloud of steam and snow is the point in the film that best captures the spirit of the book).  The train is filled with other children and there are minor adventures to be had, both on the journey and when they arrive at their wonderful destination.  Tom Hanks lends his voice and ethos to not only the Conductor, but also the Father, the Hero Boy, the Hobo, Scrooge and Santa, which essentially makes him as much the narrator of the tale as several of the characters.  That is important because there really is a sense here of a story being told that is a key part of the dynamic.  Like most Christmas messages, this is one that has to be passed along each year so that people remember it and keep it in their hearts.<br /><br />I have no problem believing as a general rule of thumb that anybody who has not read the book would have no problems adding another star to their rating for this 2004 film.  The computer animation is pretty good and this will undoubtedly becoming a favorite for both the young and the young at heart.  Final note: I am coming to terms with the fact that you have to wait about a year for Christmas movies to come out on DVD.  Certainly this is the time of year to want to watch and buy such things, but it always seems strange to think that I was interested in seeing this movie a year ago.  Then again, "Miracle on 34th Street" was actually released on May 2, 1947, so go figure (but that is the official movie of Thanksgiving, even with Santa as a pivotal character).</p></br><a href="../users/AMNNPDX9MFEUD.html">AMNNPDX9MFEUD</a><br/><p>I'm not a huge fan of this movie - let's get that out of the way up front. I think the book was original and charming and the movie was simply over the top, a techno orgasm. Furthermore, I don't care for this type of animation. Why would animation want to try to look deceivingly real? I don't get it. I enjoy animation that revels in its absurdity rather than trying to fool the audience or make them gasp with amazement at how realistic it looks. Lastly, call me old fashioned, but I'm a fan of the tv specials of the 60s that celebrated Christmas, and they are the measurement of joyful holiday viewing I hold all other movies, specials, etc. up against.<br />Imagine how surprised I was when I showed this in my kindergarten class today and the children were mesmerized! You must understand (those of you who work with youngsters can attest), having two dozen kids sit quietly for over ninety minutes is nothing short of miraculous. No matter how popular or entertaining the choice is, there are always a handful who get squirrely and start chatting or bothering their classmates, and soon the viewing devolves into a battle to keep the room quiet for those who want to continue watching. And yet, today the room was quiet and engaged!<br />It struck me that perhaps this was a new tradition that had been born. This movie, despite my misgivings, has managed to perform the kind of seasonal magic that so many films strive for and so many never achieve. The children were getting the message, thrilled with the wild ride, and, sorry for the heavy handed cliche, but BELIEVING! Amazing. They may never know the Rankin-Bass delight of cheesy stop-action puppetry, the hilarious dance scenes of the Peanuts gang, or the sinister glory of Chuck Jones' Grinch, but damn if they haven't found their own Christmas classic to revel in for those years they chose to believe. One day they may try to foist this on their children and come away with the same sadness and disillusion that I had when my kids (mine and the school children) yawn during Rudolph, but hopefully they'll learn the same lesson I did. Merry Christmas!</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2<br /><br />"Polar Express" is an animated film version of the beloved children's book by Chris Van Allsburg.  In order to give the film a true "storybook" look and feel, the filmmakers used real life actors, then digitally altered them to make them appear more like animated figures to help them blend in with the backgrounds.  The result is a frequently dazzling, though often strangely creepy work, depending upon the individual scene.<br /><br />The movie tells the tale of a boy who is just beginning to question the existence of Santa.  One Christmas Eve, while he is lying awake mulling over his dilemma, a mysterious train magically appears in front of his house, carrying with it an enigmatic conductor who bids him enter.  Torn between his dual impulses towards both doubt and curiosity, he ultimately hops on board, only to find it filled with other specially selected children all on their way to the North Pole.<br /><br />On the positive side, the film features gorgeously designed and lovingly detailed backdrops that transport the viewer to a genuinely entrancing world of imagination and fantasy.  Director Robert Zemeckis and his many animators and visual effects specialists bring this world to life through a dazzling combination of rich colors and uninhibited movement.  Any single frame of this film could be used in an illustrated version of the original text.<br /><br />The glorious visuals alone help the film to overcome the somewhat episodic nature of the storyline and the built-in repetitiveness that comes along with it.  However, the movie runs into its greatest trouble with the look of the human characters.  Although they are leagues ahead of the people in two-dimensional animation, there is a certain dead-eyed quality to them that is often disconcerting.  Moreover, Santa's elves, creepy enough in close-up, look distressingly like a massive colony of swarming red ants when the camera pulls back.  Thus, the movie ends up being at its weakest where it should be at its strongest - in conveying the innocent magic of Christmas.  On the other hand, the final scenes posses a subtle tenderness that conveys the spirit of the season without becoming overly mawkish or sentimental about it.  And Tom Hanks does first-rate work providing the voices for virtually all the male characters in the film.<br /><br />"Polar Express" may never achieve the classic status of the best holiday films, but some of its images will make it worth re-visiting every few seasons.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AP6H48QHX8BR.html">A3AP6H48QHX8BR</a><br/><p>This movie brought me to tears and is perhaps the best Christmas movie since "Miracle On 34th Street" or "A Christmas Story."  What's not to like about this movie??? Based  on the classic book- a boy who has begun to doubt Santa exsist and is slowly losing the magic of Christmas hops onbroad the Polar Express and travels to the North Pole.<br /><br />On the train meeting kids who truly believe or having Christmas doubts themselves.<br /><br />Arriving at the North Pole in an unbelievable holiday scene he slowly realizes that believeing is seeing what you can't. Upon meeting Santa and making some friends on the Polar Express. This precious little boy realizes Santa exsists in the hearts of all who believe.<br /><br />Tom Hanks as always in OUTSTANDING performing in mulitply roles in the movie. The animation is simply beautiful better than "Finding Nemo" or "Shrek" for each scene and frame looks like your watching an moving oil painting.<br /><br />The songs are beautiful and will get you into the holiday spirit.<br /><br />In short this movie is PURE genius... but, to my surprise the kids in my family did not like the story that much-probably because they could not relate. As an adult- I totally understood the emphsasis placed in the movie- that as you get older the magic slowly dies and the spirit/excitement about Christmas does as well. So when I saw the final scene I couldn't help but cry for I knew that I will NEVER again be able to hear the sound of that precious bell-that rings for those who believe.<br /><br />This movie is a rare Christmas movie- that is solely focused on the true nature/spirit of Christmas. If your an adult you simply MUST rent or buy this movie this season you'll find yourself-wishing you could still believe. 5-Stars All the Way!</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>A young boy named Billy (Hayden McFarland) who wants to believe in Santa Claus gets his wish as a magical train and the conductor (Tom Hanks) gives him a ticket to hop aboard the magic train to the North Pole with other children especially the fast talking nerd boy named Know-it-all (Voiced by Eddie Deezen) as they head on an all till midnight journey to see Santa Claus before he leaves to give them their gifts.<br /><br />A magicial, imaginative and well done CGI animated fantasy that is very faithful to the popular kids book by Chris Van Allan. This is one of the first attempts at photorealism in CGI animation before Avatar perfected it, it feels a little plastic and crooked at times but who cares. Tom Hanks plays all 5 different characters and even has a voice by Steven Tyler in two roles, Robert Zemeckis has made an enjoyable and wonderful Christmas treat for everyone.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers stunning quality picture and flawless sound like if you saw it in theaters and of course there's great extras like trailer, featurettes, and motion capture segments.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>A young boy lies awake in his room one snowy Christmas Eve, excited and alert. Breathing silently. Hardly moving. Waiting.He's listening for a sound he's afraid that he might never hear--the ringing bells of Santa's sleigh. The time is five minutes to midnight. Suddenly, the boy is startled by a thunderous roar. Clearing the mist from his window he sees the most amazing sight--a gleaming black train rumbles to a stop right in front of his house, the steam from its powerful engine hissing through the night sky and the softly falling snowflakes. The boy rushes outside, clad only in his pajamas and slippers, and is met by the train's conductor who seems to be waiting just for him. This movie is magical in a way that will enchant kids and give adults a twinge of nostalgia.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Christmas makes saps of us all, and if Hollywood knows how to do anything it's how to make a few nickels from our sappery - how else can you explain Playboy bunny Jenny McCarthy having not one but two holiday movies playing on The Family Channel (!) this year?<br /><br />So it was only a matter of time before America's most beloved movie star, Tom Hanks, found his way into America's most beloved holiday.  Re-teaming with Robert Zemeckis (they previously worked together on two little independent films you might have seen, "Forrest Gump" and "Cast Away"), Hanks gets to play five different roles thanks to motion-capture technology and Zemeckis's desire to push digital filmmaking to new frontiers.  It's a bit of a distraction for the adults who keep trying to find Tom Hanks in the various digital characters, but since it's Tom Hanks we don't care too much (we also don't care that his train conductor's Chicago accent ebbs and flows like the tide).<br /><br />But "The Polar Express" is a kids movie and should be judged accordingly.  On that level, "TPE" is a near-triumph.  Our hero, an unnamed boy of around 10-12 years old, is doubting Santa on Christmas Eve.  He is old enough to spot the chinks in Santa's armor he is in danger of Not Believing In Santa.  Then, as he searches for slumber on Christmas Eve, a huge old-fashioned locomotive pulls up in front of his house, somewhat shocking because there are no train tracks.  He reluctantly climbs aboard and is off on an adventure of a lifetime, rocketing down the tracks towards the North Pole along with several other kids in various stages of Christmas skepticism.<br /><br />Visually, "TPE" is a stunner, whether it's capturing the beauty of a winter countryside, churning your stomach as the train shoots down a 179-degree grade at Glacier Gulch, or meandering through Santa's charming red-brick home town at the North Pole.  This is animation that's one step away from reality, in a good way.<br /><br />Sure, there are some glitches.  A quick song-and-dance number serves as a reminder (along with Richard Gere's performance in "Chicago") that not all movie stars are ready for musicals.  The Josh Groban ballad "Believe" gets a little tired, and the appearance of Steven Tyler from Aerosmith as an elf to sing "Rockin' on Top of the World" reeks of a blatant attempt to increase soundtrack sales.<br /><br />All things considered, while "TPE" is not going to knock either the Grinch (cartoon version) or "A Christmas Story" from their perches  as the top Christmas movies, it's a proud addition to the family DVD library - a welcome excuse to ignore the latest holiday pseudo-entertainment from secondary "talents" like Ms. McCarthy.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>A great Christmas movie to pull out every year to watch with the family.

Not exactly a lump of coal but a disappointment considering the talent involved(Robert Zemeckis, Tom Hanks).  Once the train  reached it's destination, the North Pole, is when the film for me began to gel.  It is at this juncture of the film where the characters, CGI though they may be, develope identities and you start to empathize with them.  The film's message of believing in the spirit of Christmas was palpable and not some cynical catchphrase.  What accounts for the film's split personality?  My guess is that in fleshing out a thin illustrated children's book to feature length the filmmakers didn't have enough material so they compensated with visual fluorishes.  On the whole this is a nice picture that falls short of being a great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>A young boy who has begun to doubt the existence of Santa Claus is invited to board the Polar Express, a magical train that takes children such as him to the North Pole to see Santa at work with their own eyes.  The power of this film resides in its visuals.  A process called "performance capture" was used to wed the performances of real actors to computer simulated characters and environments based on the artwork of children's author Chris Van Allsburg.  There are many magical and innovative sequences, such as the one in which we follow a lost ticket as it flutters through the air, going through a series of adventures of its own before ending up back on the train where it started.  Santa's village, which looks like a deserted Eastern European village, is quite creepy.  Christmas carols echo from loudspeakers, but they always seem to be somewhere off in the distance.<br /><br />Concerning the story, there's not much going on.  The original book is quite slim, so the movie pumps up the story to feature length with lots of action-filled misadventures.  It ends up telling the story of a journey without really having much to say about it.  Furthermore, I'm not a religious person, but even I was struck by the irony of a secular Christmas story being about a crisis of faith.  In addition, this film is really not a musical, so it's quite jarring when the characters break into song at one point.  Having said all that, I feel that the visual style of the film elevates it and grants it a power and resonance that is not present in the script./</p></br><a href="../users/AOYTQFRLD8VLP.html">AOYTQFRLD8VLP</a><br/><p>Tom Hanks dominates this lively, warm, and sweet animated feature, based on the 1985 Caldecott Medal winning book of the same name by Chris  Van Allsburg.<br />  We travel to a home in a snow-filled suburb of Michigan one Christmas Eve, where a young boy on the verge of adolescence lies in bed, hoping to hear the sound of Santa's sleigh bells. His parents (voiced by Tom Hanks and Leslie Zemeckis) check on him and his sister, Sarah (Leslie Zemeckis/Ashly Holloway). But as logic, reasoning, and concrete proof are becoming more essential to the young lad, he has reason to doubt that he will hear the bells; his World Book Encyclopedias tell him the North Pole is a barren wasteland where life cannot be sustained, therefore, no place for Santa to have a toy facory. He has a newspaper story about striking department store Santas, and a copy of Norman Rockwell's painting, "The Discovery", featuring a child discovering his father's Santa Claus suit.<br />  Soon enough, there is a mysterious rumbling outside his house. Clad only in his pajamas, robe, and slippers, our Hero Boy wanders out into the snow to investigate. In so doing, he is confronted by an enormous train called The Polar Express, and a conductor urging him to get on.<br />  Reluctantly, he does so, and as a smiling snowman waves in the distance, he is off.<br />  He encounters a group of children in one of the cars, clad only in nightclothes like himself despite the cold. Another little boy(voiced by Peter Scolari) is hesitant to get on, and almost misses the train. Once aboard, he remains by himself in a dark box car.<br /> The Hero Boy becomes better acquainted with his fellow passengers. The most prominent of these are the Know-It-All (voiced by the Eternal Nerd, Eddie Deezen, who is very much in his element), and  the Hero Girl (Nona Gaye), the latter of whom expresses a motherly concern for the Lonely Boy, whose name we learn is Billy.<br />  The children are entertained by the waiters who treat them to an amusing performance while serving hot chocolate.<br /> During the heart of the journey, the children engage in various acts of kindness and civility towards each other, and the Lonely Boy is made to feel more and more included. At one point, a train ticket goes astray and has an interesting journey of its own.<br /> The conductor, Hero Boy and Hero Girl deal with goofy engineers (voiced by the late Michael Jeter, to whom the film is lovingly dedicated), and a dangerous jaunt down an exteremely steep slope.<br />  The Hero Boy has periodic encounters with  a mysterious Hobo(also voiced by Hanks) who confronts him about his lack of faith in Santa, but does help him save a life.<br /> The conductor comes up with an unorthodox way of getting a herd of caribou blocking the train out of the way, and the Hero Boy and Hero Girl view a car filled with damaged toys and are exposed to the concept of recycling.<br />  In the meantime, the Lonely Boy watches the night and begins to sing a wistful carol which becomes more hopeful-sounding when the Hero Girl joins in. Soon, the four main characters are treated to a viewing of the Northern Lights as they approach their destination.<br /> The Christmas City is lively and full of light. The children are surrounded by a multitude of elves, and the three children on whom the story focuses break away from the others after disembarking.<br /> Amid an array of Christmas carols from the 1940s and '50s (in marvelous counterpoint to Alan Silvestri's glorious score), the three observe the inner workings of Santa's toy factory, watching the elves as they monitor the behavior of children all over the world.<br />  Traveling in a tube-like vehicle, as they saw the elves do, they find their way to a conveyer belt where Billy finds a gift with his name and address. But soon the children and  the gift are dumped into the bag on Santa's sleigh. The Know-It-All is found among the packages as well.<br />  To the strains of "Santa Claus is Coming to Town", sung by a young Frank Sinatra, Santa Claus appears, and the crowd of elves and children go wild with delight.<br />  From his position in the crowd, the Hero Boy cannot see Santa. A bell  falls off of the sleigh's reindeer harness and the Hero Boy picks it up, listening for the jingle and trying to believe with all his might. Of all the children in attendance, Santa selects him to receive the first gift of Christmas before taking off to deliver the gifts.<br /> Watch for a fun cameo by Steve Tyler as an Elf Lieutenant and Elf Singer!<br /> Soon, the children are homeward bound, and the conductor punches a special message of either praise or suggestions for improvement into each of their tickets.<br />  The Hero Boy discovers the harness bell missing, and he is as disappointed about that as Billy was about relinquishing his gift to an elf.<br />  But the magic that both felt had slipped away, is indeed reclaimed on Christmas Day--a theme touched upon the the film's beautiful closing anthem, warmly and soronously sung by Josh Grobin.<br />  While the story focuses on the magic and myths of Christmastime, the Hero Boy and his family are presumably going to attend a church service that day. We learn that as he gets older, the Hero Boy gradually becomes the only one who can hear the sleigh bell.<br /> I wish those on Amazon a fond Christmas 2006, and may we always enjoy the sweetness of the sleigh bells!</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>My daughter has defiantly enjoyed this film. Robert Zemeckis is one of the most creative movie minds in the business. He has always been way ahead in movie technology. Whether it was Back To The Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, or Forrest Gump, Zemeckis has always been where the future technology is. And the same goes for The Polar Express, which is a visual masterpiece... and an okay story.<br /><br />As stated earlier, the visual effects are amazing in this movie. Zemeckis used a motion capture device, the same thing that video game creators use in sports games. Everything from the train ride to the design of the North Pole (which is the best visual part of the movie) is purely amazing. Also, Tom Hanks plays five different characters. Everyone from Billy to the train conductor to Santa Claus himself, are Tom Hanks' facial and body movements. The major problem to me is that Zemeckis tried really hard to stretch a book that was only about 30 pages long into an hour and forty minute long movie, and some scenes are really stretched out to fill in time.<br /><br />My overall opinion is that this was a good movie, but nothing particularly special. "The Polar Express" will probably become a children's' holiday classic. I would not call it the best Christmas movie ever, but more likely than not, children will find enjoyment in the story of a child who learns to believe again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Director Robert Zemeckis' films have always used the latest in technology to bring a new way of approaching special effects. The process of animating toons in Who Framed Roger Rabbit without the grain from earlier attempts worked beautifully while Forrest Gump used old archival footage and matched it with recently shot footage and you literally can't tell the difference. Using the book of the same name for inspiration, he brings in a new technology(or let's say a revamped one) that while it does have the visuals, it lacks what should be in a Christmas film: heart.<br /><br />Hero Boy(I'm literally not making this up, that's how he's credited) is starting to not believe in Christmas. So the titular train stops by picking up other kids who don't and takes them all the way to the North Pole. It's a weird concept personally: rather than let the kids just not believe, it's like "alright kid get on and we'll prove to you Santa exists". The entire trip takes up the bulk of the film as they go through mini-adventures before reaching the North Pole.<br /><br />First thing I have to say before I start listing complaints is the visuals: holy crap these look awesome. This film is literally reference quality if you want to test your new TV. The train is quite detailed, the colors, the landscape all has topnotch quality written on it. I'm going to mention the actual characters next because that's where it falters.<br /><br />One common complaint in reviews was the way the characters looked, especially the eyes. They look rather lifeless and without a soul, as if you were staring into a doll. When the Jolly Fat Man shows up, to me he literally looked like a mannequin. Also mouth movements looked incredibly strange to me. The idea of using "performance capture" it's the same as motion capture but also capturing the faces is a relatively new technology(the same technique was emplored to bring Gollum to life in the Lord of the Rings trilogy) but the execution is still off.<br /><br />Another complaint I personally have is the padding of the length. It's literally a 45 minute film stretched out twice the size, you can notice scenes just seem to be put in to expand the length(such as a rather lame hot chocolate song). Also hearing Tom Hanks' recognizable voice coming out of no more than 5(!) characters takes you out of the film a bit. He does an excellent job with Santa though, the only time I couldn't tell it was him.<br /><br />Now the ever important question: since it's designed to be a holiday film does it work. In a way. Kids will love it. It's got the magic and splendor that Christmas should have although they might find it a bit too suspenseful, especially when the train starts to speed up. Buy it for the kids but as an adult watching it, the flaws will be easily detectable.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>In 1985 sculptor Chris Van Allsburg published his first children's book, THE POLAR EXPRESS, which became an instant classic, especially appropriate for family reading during the holidays.  The beauty of the book was not only a simple story about a lad's discovery of the real meaning of Christmas, but also the power of Allburg's glorious art - which was awarded with the Caldecott Medal in 1986.<br /><br />Some of that book is retained and some of that is lost in this grossly overproduced, extravagantly expensive, film transition of the book.  For reasons only known to director Robert Zemeckis, who also adapted the story for his film, and to his long time friend Tom Hanks, the decision was made to make not just an animated feature and not a computer enhanced film using actors, but a strange amalgamation of the two.  We are seeing puppet-like characters morphed to resemble real people - and that must have caused the animators headaches but earned big money!<br /><br />But despite the bigger than life extravaganza version of basically an intimate story, the theme comes through and the message is sweet.  Whether the 'fillers' heavily frosted on this version are additive is up to the taste of the viewer.  But it is a tour de force for Hanks who plays almost everyone in the film, and it is evident that the film's heart is in the right place.  Grady Harp, November, 05</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>Just in time for Christmas, I have another opportunity to upset some people with my two-cents on "The Polar Express." I came into the film with no preconceptions--if anything, I thought it would be cute and pleasant. I am not one of those people who treasures the book and dislikes the film for not being true enough. While I may not be the most sensitive viewer in the world, I've been known to enjoy a good Christmas tale or two. The animated Grinch, Frosty and Rudolph all work for me. "A Christmas Story," "It's A Wonderful Life" and a number of variations of "A Christmas Carol" always delight. And I love animated features from classic Disney to current day Pixar (only the good ones, of course). But, truth be told, "The Polar Express" kind of mystified me.<br /><br />The film has some visually appealing moments, and the animation is state of the art. The action sequences were technically impressive. I particularly enjoyed the scenes with no characters (for reasons I'll outline in a bit). The exterior shots of the train are stunning, especially during the more exciting moments. When the Express is racing around roller coaster tracks or sliding across ice, the movie comes to life. And an extended sequence following a ticket as it flies through the air is artfully done--a truly great moment. The voice acting is fine. While I didn't particularly think it stood out, it also didn't hamper the story. And the plot was serviceable, if not unique in any way.<br /><br />Much has been made about using the real actor's movements and turning them into animation. I certainly don't have a problem with the concept--but in some cases, it had an unfortunate effect. I truly found some of the characters to be creepy. Now, I usually try to use objective wording--but "creepy" is exactly how my friend and I both described it after the movie. And interestingly enough, it is a word used many, many times within other amazon reviews. The little girl, especially, was so unreal in her realness--I don't know, something was lost in the translation.<br /><br />Then there were a couple of exceedingly odd musical numbers. One, the songs were bizarre. And two, the frantic pacing of the accompanying "dance" performances (be it by waiters or elves) was jarring and unsettling. The music adds nothing to the story except another opportunity to be "creeped out." I didn't feel it was necessary to try to extend this story, the film is too long by half. Only the most attentive and patient of adults or children are likely to make it to the end without needing a break. While, of course, the film's message is sweet--it's laid on so thickly at the end. I know some people love this film, but for me it didn't work. Call me Scrooge this year, but "The Polar Express" will not be joining my annual Christmas viewing. KGHarris, 12/06.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>For a 21-year-old, it's been a long time since I believed in Santa. It was getting a bit stupid when I got told Santa didn't come down the chimney in our house (as we didn't have a chimney), he came in through the front door, which my parents left unlocked for him. OK then. And my mum always left out sherry for Santa, which she would then drink. And I get freaked out by these people who dress up as Santa to entertain the kids. He's not real. Does that mean I'm not going to get any presents this year? No. Cos they're sitting upstairs that's why.<br /><br />But for me, this film made me feel like I should still believe in the big Mr C, simply because of the magical, sweet ending. It meant so much, and showed how much you have grown up when you watch it. Just a simple thing like a bell ringing means you believe in Santa or you don't.<br /><br />I'm always a bit iffy around animated movies, simply because now I'm older, I notice the lip synch doesn't match etc. But I didn't notice it here. And in fact it was so well done, that I actually felt like I was watching a real movie with real actors. Also, it had all the classic 'moments' from cartoons in there. You never saw adults' faces and no one is given really proper names.<br /><br />Tom Hanks does a lot of the voices, and is the characters in this, and it's absolutely amazing how they managed to pick up his facial expressions. The animated character(s) even look like Tom Hanks. He voices these characters: Hero Boy, Father, Conductor, Hobo, Scrooge, and Santa Claus. I didn't really get the character of the Hobo, I thought he was originally going to be Santa, but he appears & disappears. That was really the only character I wasn't sure about. And Eddie Deezen also voices the know-it-all kid, who appeared in Grease, as wait for it, a geek!!! Even the kid looks pretty similar to how he did in Grease, just with lighter hair.<br /><br />There's a lot of bits relating to Robert Zemeckis' other big film Back To The Future. In a news photo of Santas on strike, their placards say they're picketing Lone Pine Mall. Hero Boy says, "I've wanted to do that my whole life," after tugging on the trains whistle. This is the same thing Doc Brown says.<br /><br />The score is also magical, and has one of those memorable cues, that sounds so much like Edward Scissorhands, you'll actually think it was. It's a brilliant score by Alan Silvestri.<br /><br />It's a shame it's a Christmas movie, as it's so magical, it could be watched at anytime, but the obvious references to Santa etc, kinda means it can only be watched once a year. I can't wait for next year to watch it again. This will definitely be a film you'll watch year after year.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TOH8S8I1VT9R.html">A1TOH8S8I1VT9R</a><br/><p>A lot of good reviews (positive and nagative) concerning this film.  the detractors find some good and the supporters find some flaw.  To me, that makes sense.  In a nut-shell this is a film full of "WOW!!" moments with enough flaws to make you go "Hmmm?".  I won't nitpick the story.  It's compelling enough.  Probably more danger than I'd like to see a nine-year-old face, but that's part of what makes it compelling.  What I do nit-pick is the overall "feal" of the film.  Sometimes it's spine chilling...  ... and sometimes just chilling.  Here's a list of the things that made me go "WOW" and "Hmmm?"....<br /><br />WOW!!!<br />-The overall texture of the film is mind-boggling.  I'd need to see it 20 time to appreciate every detail the artist have included.<br />-The train.  I love trains, and this depiction is just awesome.  Never watch this without, AT LEAST, a decent home theater.  the sound penetrates you.<br />-The flying ticket scene.  A great, uncut sequence.  I think I like it so much because no people are involved for most of it.<br />-The last perils before reaching the North Pole are riveting.  Unfortunately it is literally down hill from there.<br />-"Santa Claus is Coming to Town" is a spine tingling moment.<br />-The overall scale of things is pretty impressive, but....<br /><br />Hmmm?<br />-Things are sometimes so big they are forboding or even down-right scary.  The Northpole is a big and scary place.<br />-The elfs are creepy.  Most have bad skin and razor stubble.  They could also use Hermee to fix there teeth.<br />-You may have heard, Santa is a bit wierd looking. All of the character move in an unatural way and the insides of their mouths are spooky and mysterious.  And then there's those lifeless eyes....<br />-This is picky, but nicely rendered as everything is, why could'nt they make the facial hair NOT look like it was glued on?<br />That bugged me throughout the film.<br />-Steven Tyler makes the scariest elf of them all.  Really out of place.<br />-Overall, the film fealt populated by zombies.  The dancing waiters were the strangest of all.<br /><br />Dispite these "little" comlaints, I'd have to advise seeing this film.  It had enough magic to make it compelling, and enough excitement to shake your nerves.  My 2 year old son (a train freek with an ear infection) made it about 3/4 through until they stopped showing the train.  Then he cried allot.  We took him out and he cried to get back in.  So, we stood on the side and held him through the last 20 minutes of the film.  The point is, scary as stuff was, he liked it and I enjoyed it too.  And forget the book.  The only thing you'll see from the book is the beginning and the end,  come to think of it, that is the book!</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2URG8OHNEDS.html">A1R2URG8OHNEDS</a><br/><p>This is one of the best movies of the year. Not only does it have a heartfelt story, but it is visually amazing. The other computer generated image movies that came out this year were "Shrek 2" and "The Incredibles." The difference between the three movies is that "The Polar Express" took of picture of Tom Hanks, who plays about five different parts, and then they animated the picture of it. The people characters all look realistic, and the movie could give the impression of a life action film. What I love about animation is that you can do anything, and this movie creates it's own world. It reminded me of "The Wizard of Oz." Instead of a girl, it was a boy, and he enters a magic land full of new adventures and new friends. "The Polar Express" is also based on a children's book of the same name. I never read the book, or heard of it before the movie came out, but I heard that the movie is as good as the book. It is hard to make a movie version of a 40 page book, and alot of people were disappointed with the movie version of "The Cat in the Hat." I'll have to look in the store for this book and flip through it there. Tom Hanks is having a very good year, with "The Ladykillers" and "The Terminal" all getting five stars from me. I just wanted to take in all of this animation, and enter this world, and I haven't been so impressed with animation since last years "Finding Nemo." I'm just looking forward for the next technological leap in animation.<br /><br />The movie begins with the young Hero Boy sleeping in his bed, waiting for Santa. He is at that age where he is beginning to doubt if Santa is real or not. As he is lying in bed, a train pulls up in front of the house, and The Conductor asks if he is coming on board. Hesitating, the boy gets on and meets the Hero Girl, and the Know It All. Know It All is that kind of kid where everything that he says sounds like he thinks he is better than everybody else. He probably doesn't mean it, but he gives that impression. They are going to the North Pole, for it is Christmas Eve, and on the way, after picking up young Billy, they go through many adventures, including riding on ice, going down Glaciar Gulp, which is the steepest mountain in the North Pole, and finally making it to the North Pole. Along the way, the Hero Boy also meets the Hobo who lives on the top of the train, who is a ghost that whenever he disappears, one of his hands always lingers. When they make it to the North Pole, it's not all smooth sailing, and they meet the elves, who run a very tight organized layout, and get to see the Christmas Eve ceremony.<br /><br />"The Polar Express" is always entertaining, and you can't take your eyes off the screen. I have to compare it to "The Incredibles" because that is the other big animated movie of the season. "The Polar Express" is Rated G, as opposed to the PG that "The Incredibles" has, but this movie is much more darker. There is not a bright tropical island, with the little boy fighting other super villians, instead it is a much more sober tale about believing. The Hero Boy doesn't really believe, and I loved the way to believe. The Boy doesn't get all the perks that everybody else does. For example, he can't hear the sleigh bells, because he doesn't really believe that they are there. He believes he is in a dream for a short period of time. I found this movie to be more entertaining than "The Incredibles" and much more visually stunning, even though I gave both movies five stars. Tom Hanks played the voice over of the Hero Boy, The Hobo, The Conductor, The Boy's father, and even Santa Claus himself. This is the best Christmas movie of the year as well, and beats "Surviving Christmas" and "Christmas with the Kranks" combined. I wanted to thank every person in the credits personally. The slight thing I didn't like was when Hero Girl and Billy had to sing that sappy Christmas song. It did slow the movie down a little, kind of like "If I Were the King of the Forest" in "The Wizard of Oz." It broke the mood of the story, and if that was cut I wouldn't have minded.<br /><br />I saw "The Polar Express" twice. I saw it on opening day on the regular screen, and then I decided to see it on IMAX, otherwise I would have reviewed this already. I recommend the IMAX version more. It is on a much bigger screen, and it is in 3D. It was like riding a roller coaster, and I was able to study the animation more clearly with the crystal clear screens. I don't wear my glasses often, but I can see that the 3D glasses were much more bigger to cover the glasses as well. It was great seeing some of my favorite scenes on the IMAX, including the journey of the train ticket over mountain, and in a birds nest, and especially the train riding on the ice, I won't say anymore. I loved the music of the movie, as well, and it provded such a sweet and sad undertone, which touches the heart of the movie. I wanted to cry during the very last line of the movie, both times I saw it. It's very happy, but subtitling sad, and it was then when I knew that "The Polar Express" would be close to the top of the Best of 2004.<br /><br />ENJOY!<br /><br />Rated G</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>I have seen the future of movies.<br /><br />As of this writing, "The Incredibles" is getting all the attention and box office bucks, but if you want to experience a jaw-dropping, eye-popping, wondrous and magical experience, please, please do not hesitate to see this film in 3D on the biggest Imax screen you an find.<br /><br />There's no doubt in my mind that this awesomely beautiful, painterly, digital creation was designed for 3D.  When you put on your polarizing 3D glasses (no red/blue lenses) and the movie starts with the 3D Castle Rock logo, you will be transported to another time and place. And not only that, the incredible feeling of transcendant magic that you always hope will happen in movies but seldom does will stay with you for the duration of this truly amazing film. And hours afterward...<br /><br />Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks had a vision for something that we have never seen before and they delivered.  It's not just the idea but the extraordinary execution. If Chris Van Allsburg's illustrated but static story is simple, the seductive power of the expanded, detailed, moving images is huge.  And the theme about Doubt and the Gift of Believing in what seems too good to be true IS of course the heart of the Christmas story.<br /><br />Other reviewers (jealous gremlins from Pixar?) have mentioned the animated kids look like "zombies with dead eyes."  I didn't see that at all.<br /><br />The 3D digital version is very much like Van Allsburg's illustrations.  And the powerful steam locomotive has real mass and inertia as it drives the story on its dangerous route to the North Pole and the huge, fabled city where millions of elves serve a mighty but kindly Father Christmas.  This Santa is no department store joke. (But who or what is the hobo on the train? Could he be Santa in another guise?)<br /><br />I can't wait to see it again and sit back as the huge, shimmering, crystal clear fully 3D images come to life in the space between my eyes and the screen, enveloping me in a world of wonder unlike anything I have experienced at the movies.  And the great, inventive sound mix and music score (except for one song) on the 15,000 Watt Imax true surround sound system are an aural delight that perfectly enhances the 3D visuals.<br /><br />I'm sure the 2D version looks just fine. But the real magic only happens on the big Imax screen in 3D.<br /><br />See this film and you will understand why the future of movies has arrived.  An absolute barrier has been broken where ancient art and new technology perfectly merge.  Now for certain, you can make real -- or should I say "reel"? -- anything you can dream.<br /><br />By all means jump aboard.  Take this ride and you too will go from doubt to believing -- anything is possible.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>I had read that this movie cost 160 million to make, and the special effects are amazing at times, but I really could not get into the weird digital animation, it was like the characters were alien, I could not really connect with any of the leads, especially the main character, he seemed so void of emotion and otherworldly, I mean could they have at least made their eyes not so dead?  On some level the film is quite beautiful, and I appreciate the enormous amount of work it took to get this film to look this way..I realize Zemikis was trying to give the movie the look of the books amazing illustrations and again on one level it works, but it sort of takes all the feeling out of the movie, I never really felt vested in the outcome of this kids trip, and the beginning of the movie, with the hobo on the top of the train was not only bizarre but more than a little spooky and i never really got his revelevance, he was never properly explained.  Hanks voices several character and he is alright i guess, but frankly they could have saved the money on his salary and gotten some unknown, I mean who really cared if Hanks was the voice?  I hope he at least did this thing for scale, but im doubting it.  I did like how the setting was the 50's, it added to the nastalgia and the CGI North Pole was fantastic, but the story waxed and wained and took a long time to get going, all and all hardly "A Christmas Story".</p></br><a href="../users/AMP7TQRWAIE84.html">AMP7TQRWAIE84</a><br/><p>Enchanting.

It's that special time every year I give the cynic in me a little time off.  It's also the time I let myself get pulled into the movies of the season.  I'm not talking about the fodder for Oscar that permeate this time, or the stupid little comedies created to play off these high class art.  I'm talking about those movies about Christmas, the really engage and audience.  Films like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, A CHRISTMAS STORY, MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET, or MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS.  Films that on the surface are a little schmaltzy and silly, but have so much heart I can't stand to be pulled in.<br /><br />THE POLAR EXPRESS follows the adventure of a young boy whom has lost his faith in Santa.  He muses the question any growing boy would ask "Does Santa exist?"  When a mysterious train appears on his front lawn on Christmas Eve it whisks him away on an adventure that could take him to meet the big man himself.  Was it a dream? Does Santa really exist?  All these question will be answered in 90 minutes<br /><br />Christmas has a new movie: THE POLAR EXPRESS.  A film so sweet, and breathtaking it's hard as a critic to shower it with negatives.  Of course I could... I could tell you there are moments when the films momentum screeches to a halt, the ending goes on forever, and the tone of the movie is a little to sweet for its own good.  I also thought the needless cameo by Steven Tyler completely dragged me out of the film.<br /><br />"Oh look it's the guy from Areosmith," I mused. It took me out of the film for a moment because I thought I was in a much cheaper film.  But I will not acknowledge those small trifles anymore.<br /><br />This film is breathtaking.  It's one fueled entirely by imagination.  The new computer imaging effects do a great job of conveying a magical aura, without drawing us into reality.  I don't believe we'll ever get to the point where a computer generated person will look human, (and that's just fine with me.)  Had the creator's of the Polar Express tried to do that it would have destroyed the look of the film.  But the characters odd movements, and almost human emotions strike the right chords.<br /><br />I loved the dancing chef's And waiter's sequence on THE POLAR EXPRESS.  It was silly and  so full of life.  I wondered if they had tried to shoot this film in live action (without green screens and body suits) what would this sequence look like.  My thought: Bad Broadway.  But the CGI characters could fly through the air, do difficult physical stunts and all without the scene feeling choppy.  This is the first big sequence and it sets you up for the even more amazing wonders to come.<br /><br />The Polar Express also takes us on an adventure in speed over and icy lake, down the steepest hill imaginable, and introduces us to characters that are both vibrant and fun.  Tom Hanks fills at least 5 roles, and gives each one their own aura.  I especially loved the vagrant Hurdy Gurdy man whom appears and disappears to help out the young hero.  The scene on ski's... I really don't want to ruin it for you.<br /><br />THE POLAR EXPRESS is high art aimed at a young audience.  If you have a heart of stone, I wouldn't recommend you waste your money here.  But if you like to be whisked away to far off lands, if you have a place in your heart for Christmas, give THE POLAR EXPRESS a try.  It's so much fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XJOSJN6FHFO0.html">A1XJOSJN6FHFO0</a><br/><p>I sat and watched this movie with my six year old granddaughter and both of us walked away with a smile.  Do you believe in Santa Claus? Have you lost the faith of your childhood and the simply joy of believing? Life deals us with some rough blows, times are often more hard than easy and sometimes hopelessnss is much easier to give into than faith.<br /><br />  This movie is about believing, it is about faith, love, hope. It isn't so much about believing in Santa Claus but its more about believing in something that you can hold onto. I think it was well done, characters were wonderful, visual great; I loved it all as did my granddaughter.  If you have not seen this movie yet do yourself a favor and watch it with someone you love.</p></br><a href="../users/A22J9WI2PDAVJ.html">A22J9WI2PDAVJ</a><br/><p>"The Polar Express" will be a Holiday classic. Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis hit a homerun with this all digital film. The story will hit the hearts of every child and adult.<br /><br />You will believe after watching this classic.<br /><br />Basically the plot is about a boy who questions whether Santa Claus is real. He hops aboard the Polar express to the North Pole to find Santa Claus's home on Christmas Eve. A cast of categorized kids are along for the ride of their life.<br /><br />I watched this movie with my kids. (Nine, seven and two) I was skeptical of the all digital characters at first, but that quickly faded as the story developed. The nine year old questioned the funny looking kids too, but I said it was a movie magic and that was the end of the questions. They were hooked. I especially was surprised by my two year old who sat through the entire film. Now that is movie magic.<br /><br />I got hood winked into feeling the emotions of the kids on the train. Before long I was shedding a tear along with my kids. I BELIEVE I have to give this DVD a must buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>This is a cute movie, but it is lost on an adult. It has great CGI and the chaarcters are so well done, they could pass as real people. The voices are great. Hanks does a good job on all his characters. The story is a little bland for this adult. A good attempt but it lacks something.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis, the same team who brought us such great movies as "Forrest Gump" and "Cast Away", have teamed up again, and they deliver perhaps their best movie ever in this classic adaptation of the popular children's book.<br /><br />On Christmas Eve, a massive steam train suddenly appears in front of a boy's home.  The conductor, one of Hanks' many roles in the film, jumps off and asks if the boy is getting on.  The boy asks where the train is going.  "To the North Pole!" is the conductor's reply.  After thinking it over, the boy gets on the train and he, along with several other children are soon on their way to the North Pole to see Santa.  We are introduced to some other children along the way; a young African-American girl, a Know-It-All boy, and a shy boy.  During the course of the film, all of them become very good friends.<br /><br />As the train makes its way north, the viewer is treated to many breathtaking special effects.  The scenes where the train is going up and down the mountain passes and sliding over the frozen lake are true high points of the film.  I've never seen special effects this eye-popping before in an animated film.  They are simply superb.  Upon reaching the North Pole, the children are informed that one of them will receive the first gift of Christmas.  However, before this can happen, the children must overcome having their car come uncoupled from the rest of the train, and sliding down a long slide and ending up in Santa's bag.  Who will Santa choose to recieve the first Christmas gift?<br /><br />Having three small children, I've seen my share of animated children's films in the last few years, but none of those even come close to this tremendous film.  The story is very touching, and the visual effects are out of this world.  I'm a huge Tom Hanks fan and I watch his movies every chance I get.  His roles in this movie are some of his very best, but his role as the wise and caring conductor is perhaps his best.  Needless to say, I give this movie my highest recommendation.  As long as you can still hear the sleighbell jingle, then you'll always be a true believer.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>A scrooge all year round, I have another opportunity to upset some people with my two-cents on "The Polar Express." I came into the film with no preconceptions. If anything, I thought it would be cute and pleasant. I am not one of those people who treasures the book and dislikes the film for not being true enough. While I may not be the most sensitive viewer in the world, I've been known to enjoy a good Christmas tale or two. The animated Grinch, Frosty and Rudolph all work for me. "A Christmas Story," "It's A Wonderful Life" and a number of variations of "A Christmas Carol" always delight. And I love animated features from classic Disney to current day Pixar (only the good ones, of course). But, truth be told, "The Polar Express" kind of mystified me.<br /><br />The film has some visually appealing moments, and the animation is state of the art. The action sequences were technically impressive. I particularly enjoyed the scenes with no characters (for reasons I'll outline in a bit). The exterior shots of the train are stunning, especially during the more exciting moments. When the Express is racing around roller coaster tracks or sliding across ice, the movie comes to life. And an extended sequence following a ticket as it flies through the air is artfully done, a truly great moment. The voice acting is fine. While I didn't particularly think it stood out, it also didn't hamper the story. And the plot was serviceable, if not unique in any way.<br /><br />Much has been made about using the real actor's movements and turning them into animation. I certainly don't have a problem with the concept, but in some cases, it had an unfortunate effect. I truly found some of the characters to be creepy. Now, I usually try to use objective wording, but "creepy" is exactly how my friend and I both described it after the movie. And interestingly enough, it is a word used many, many times within other critical reviews. The little girl, especially, was so unreal in her realness. I don't know, something was lost in the translation.<br /><br />Then there were a couple of exceedingly odd musical numbers. One, the songs were bizarre. And two, the frantic pacing of the accompanying "dance" performances (be it by waiters or elves) was jarring and unsettling. The music adds nothing to the story except another opportunity to be "creeped out." I didn't feel it was necessary to try to extend this story, the film is too long by half. Only the most attentive and patient of adults or children are likely to make it to the end without needing a break. While, of course, the film's message is sweet, it's laid on so thickly at the end. I know some people love this film, but for me it didn't work. Call me Scrooge this year, but "The Polar Express" will not be joining my annual Christmas viewing.

On Christmas Eve the boy is invited to ride a train to the North Pole by the conductor (Tom Hanks) and a chance to discover the his power to believe in  Christmas once and for all.<br /><br />Although audiences initially gave "Express" a chilly reception the film actually more than broke even at the box office due to repeat visits from fans of the film and a vaunted IMAX presentation. While there have been complaints that the motion capture technology used here (a familiar technique used less extensively in "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, "I, Robot" and "King Kong") giving the characters a creepy look, I found the film to be perfectly charming and no less inviting than watching any other CGI movie. While it's clear that this technique is still in its infancy (or, perhaps, in the toddler phase at this point), director Zemeckis makes good use of the technique to render characters that are believable and amazing background for the film.  "The Polar Express" is guaranteed to be a perennial at Christmas time. Tom Hanks essays a number of roles in the film which is something that could have been done without CGI (think of Peter Sellers and all the characters he played in "Dr. Strangelove" or Mike Myers in the Austin Powers movies) but the use of CGI makes the transformation into other characters a bit more believable visually.<br /><br />"Express" looks quite good on DVD. We don't see any analog artifacts (not a surprise given that it was shot digitally and rendered in a computer) nor do we see edge enhancement or other digital artifacts I've come to expect from movies shot either on film. Again, this isn't a surprise given the fact that this was transferred directly from the digital files to DVD. The colors on the train are warm and inviting while those set outside in the chilly, snow filled night has just the right frosty edge to them. The 5.1 Dolby Digital sound track sounds marvelous with crisp, clear dialogue and nice use of the surround format. The rear speakers get considerable workout with ambience and the rattle filled ride on the train enveloping us in the world of the film.<br /><br />The release of single and double disc movies is becoming more of a trend. It's clear that studios recognize that there are those who watch only the movie and have begun tailoring their DVD releases more and more for different segments of the audience. The single disc edition has just the movie and a trailer (unless you purchased the single disc edition at Best Buy--it comes with a mini-DVD that features footage from "You Look Familiar" one of the extras on the two disc edition).<br /><br />On the two disc edition you get a whole lot of extras some of which are interesting but hardly essential. "You Look Familiar" focuses on the performances of Tom Hanks and others in their multiple roles and the use of performance capture to enhance their acting for the film. We see footage of the live performance capture work show with the scene from the film which is a nice before and after comparison.<br /><br />"Genuine Ticket to Ride" features five featurettes after an introduction. "Performance Capture", "Virtual Camera", "Hair and Wardrobe", "Creating the North Pole" and "Music". At under 12 minutes it can't possible offer the depth that filmmakers might want. Nevertheless you'll learn a thing or two about the production and the obstacles, challenges and triumphs that faced the film crew.<br /><br />"Josh Groban at the Greek" features the popular singer performing the song "Believe" as well as a featurette on the creation of the song. "Meet the Snow Angels" Share the memories of cast and crew about their favorite Christmas. "Polar Express Challenge" provides an interactive game. It's not bad but kids will only want to play once or twice and forget about it once the novelty wears off. There's also a number of bonus clips throughout the second disc that are called "Stocking Stuffers" to be discovered for those who wisely use their remote control.<br /><br />Surprisingly Warner chose not to provide much detail or in depth background on the production of the film and its CGI rendering techniques. That's too bad. While this kid friendly approach will certainly be appreciated by the film's core audience, adults like to be entertained and informed as well. Perhaps we'll see something more adult orientated in the "Special Special Edition" that will no doubt come out just in time for the Holidays next year.<br /><br />"The Polar Express" charms with its delightful performances, groundbreaking use of CGI and "performance capture". While the extras could have been more comprehensive and more filling, they aren't bad. I'd suggest sticking to the single disc edition since the movie is the real highlight and the second disc probably won't be watched more than once (if that). Zemeckis has done a terrific job translating this children's story to the screen although it does have the feeling that it is padded a bit. I'd recommend the single disc edition vs. the two disc as I didn't feel the additional extras were all they were cracked up to be. Everybody jump on board but make sure to bring some hot chocolate and a nice warm blanket as it's going to be a long but fun filled ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>People look at me funny when I say that I had never heard of The Polar Express until this film was released.  Somehow, I was never introduced to the book as a child.  Hopefully, with this wonderful film now available along with the original book, no other child will grow to adulthood without taking a ride on The Polar Express.  It's a wonderful story about the spirit of Christmas and the importance of giving.  The incredible animation of the film may always be the first thing people speak of, but in the end it really does come down to the story.  It is not what you see, it's what you feel - these are the memories that will linger.<br /><br />The digital animation that brings this story to visual life is nothing short of astounding. This revolutionary "performance capture" technology makes these characters the most life-like animated characters I've ever seen.  I think they look more human than actual humans, truth be told - except for Santa.  It's a weird thing about this Santa Claus; he immediately reminded me of none other than Harry Potter's Professor Snape (even though Santa's voice was actually that of Tom Hanks).  I've heard that some kids found the whole visual look of the characters rather creepy, but I think the uncanny technology really makes the film come alive.  By incorporating the motions of live actors into the digital creative process, filmmakers were able to imbue their creations with the nuances of human expression, and one can hardly underestimate just how much that adds to the viewer's experience of the animated story.  It's really quite incredible.  Traditional animation would hardly have done this story justice, and it would have been incredibly challenging to film such a magical journey in the traditional manner.  This film has some of the most unique and exciting camera angles and perspectives I've ever seen.<br /><br />It's hard to see how anyone, child or adult, could not enjoy this movie.  It's an incredible journey, filled with both excitement and comedy, to the North Pole, for Pete's sake.  There are also moments of great warmth and emotion - most of them supplied by the Hero Girl (Nona Gaye).  Tom Hanks may steal the show in his performance of five different roles, including the Hero Boy at the center of things, but the Hero Girl - who befriends a forlorn little boy (Peter Scolari) who shies away from everyone else - is the heart and soul of this film.<br /><br />I chuckled when I read the editorial review because I also thought of Nuremberg when I saw the masses of elves rallying around Santa before his Christmas Eve departure.  Clearly, though, there is nothing but joy and kindness in this mass assembly of people - er, elves.  I loved this movie.  Unless you're a grinch or a Scrooge, just watching it will take you back to your own days of childhood and the magic that Christmas once brought.  The Polar Express is a visually dazzling, heart-warming, exceedingly good (in all senses of the word) motion picture.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>The delightful award-winning book "The Polar Express" has been turned into one of the most delightful films I've ever seen. I have since read many reviews that make me glad I watched the film before reading the reviews: some of the delight comes from being surprised by events in the film that wouldn't be a surprise if I had read them first.<br /><br />This film looks like nothing I've ever seen.  The combination of "motion-capture" acting and animation results in a look that is much more "real" looking than traditional (or even Pixar) animation, but much more stylized than simple live-action filming.  For this story - it's a perfect marriage of "story" and "look".<br /><br />To avoid spoiling the "surprises" I'll only encapsulate the first few moments.  A boy is at that age when the existence of Santa Claus is very much in question.  After all - Santa would have to fly faster than the speed of light with a bag of toys larger than an ocean liner to cover his appointed rounds.  He lies awake on Christmas Eve, waiting to hear a sound a friend has told him he will never hear - the sound of sleighbells on Santa's sleigh.<br /><br />The movie begins weaving it's magic spell from the opening seconds.  Although it's a stylized animation, it gets the most minute details exactly "right".  This is a film that knows how new-fallen snow crunches under your feet.  It knows how a kid will check the milk and cookies left for Santa for evidence of whether or not the jolly old gent has come by.  It knows how a kid will fake being asleep when the parents come in to check on you when you're SUPPOSED to be asleep.  It's a movie that knows what it is to question, and what it means to have faith.  Another thing this movie understands is that at the North Pole - Santa is a really big thing.  It's one thing to meet Santa at your local mall, but if you were going to meet him at the North Pole, wouldn't that be just a little bit bigger?<br /><br />As our hero boy lies awake in bed the whole house suddenly rumbles as if an earthquake were in progress.  He rushes outside to find a huge gleaming train.  The conductor (looking an awful lot like Tom Hanks - Mr. Hanks provides voice to six characters) calls out and asks the boy if he's going to get on board.  The boy asks where the train is going.<br /><br />"Why, the North Pole, of course!  This is the Polar Express!"<br /><br />The conductor sizes up the boy and astutely observes that the boy is at that time when he begins to not believe.  "If I were you, I'd get on board", he advises the boy.<br /><br />This is a movie that understands the transition from believing to questioning, and it understands the importance of not giving up the faith.<br /><br />If I were you - I'd watch this movie.  And be prepared for it to become one of your favorites.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CQON0P01BITL.html">A1CQON0P01BITL</a><br/><p>This is abosultely magical and wonderful. This is one to add to your holiday collection.  Our daughter sat if front of the television and didn't move...great for any age. We have the Santa with the bell from Hallmark from last year so it was great to see the movie.<br /><br />A Must Have and A Wonderful Gift</p></br><a href="../users/AXSH6O4OP5L4M.html">AXSH6O4OP5L4M</a><br/><p>When I first saw this film in a theater, I wasn't sure I liked it.  The CGI was incredible, especially the hair of the various characters and the textures of the fabrics--Santa's bag was an incredible and very real velvet.  Yet the thought of small children being "picked up" by someone, without the knowledge and consent of their parents seemed a little creepy, despite the unlikely presence of a train in their front yard, and not the best model for behavior.  With exposure, however, the film takes on more of the aspects of a roller coaster ride and while exciting is not quite so creepy.  Even the ghost becomes less threatening with time.  I would suggest, however, that parents discuss the dangerous issue of going with anyone unknown to them for any reason whatsoever with their children after the film.<br /><br />The color and quality of the film are incredible.  Almost anything that can be done with a computer seems to have been done here.  The lifelike quality of movements was exceptional; my favorites were the sudden and very purposeful movements of the animals:  wolves, a herd of elk, an eagle and Santa's reindeer.  The movements of hair and clothing were also wonderful.  The eyes of the various characters, however, seemed a little too staring and gave the faces a wooden aspect, so this is still in the realm of the sophisticated cartoon. The real character of specific objects was also very varied.  Without knowledge of context, the sleigh bell in the final scene would be almost indistinguishable from a real bell.  Yet much of the train and other items were business-as-usual cartoons.  Similarly, while some people were almost hyper-real, others were simpler cartoon characters.  Contrast with the conductor, who looks very much like Tom Hanks, and the engineer and coal stoker, who were totally Saturday-morning cartoons, was at times a little jarring.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed in the fact that so many of the parts were played by Tom Hanks.  While he is undoubtedly a gifted actor, it seemed that there might have been greater dramatic variety if the interpretations of the different characters had arisen from seperate individuals.  The children's roles were wonderful; and their singing voices exceptional.<br /><br />The most incredible and exciting scenes--and certainly those that illustrated the great potential of computer generated virtual reality--were the roller coaster-like trips down steep inclines on the train and the slipping sliding trip across the lake of ice.  One had the same sensations from viewing the film as one might have had actually undergoing the real experience.  I was totally impressed.<br /><br />The story is a perennial one, the loss of belief in "magic" by the young.  Though simple, almost everyone has been there in their time.  One almost might say that the whole story was based on the adult wish to prolong their own children's belief for a little longer--perhaps even their own, at least for the duration of the film.  Altogether, the exciting adventures, the comraderie of new friends, and the wonderful message of belief in the spirit of the holiday made the film a great success for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>It seems like every time I let controversy over a movie keep me from seeing it in the theater that I regret it.  Such was the case with this movie.  I heard a lot of criticism over this movie and I let it keep me from seeing it in the theater.  How dumb was I?  This movie is a lot of fun and a feast for your eyes.  Modern film makers make few enough of these films, and this one is a winner.<br /><br />We meet a boy who is at that age where he begins to realize that the world appears not to have as many mysteries as he believed it did when he was little.  One of those mysteries is Santa Claus.  He truly wants to believe, but the evidence he has gathered tells him that there is no Santa Claus.<br /><br />As he falls asleep on Christmas Eve he hears a most unlikely sound: a train pulled by a steam engine outside his house.  He quickly runs outside to see a very real train making all sorts of hissing and ticking noises.  Then he sees and hears a conductor yelling "All aboard!"  The boy does not get on the train in spite of the conductor's best efforts to convince him to board.  As the train pulls away the boy changes his mind and barely makes it aboard for a journey to the North Pole!<br /><br />We soon meet several characters who will be keys to the plot of the movie throughout.  Tom Hanks plays no less than five characters:  the boy's father, the conductor, the boy himself, Santa Claus, and a hobo ghost.  I could tell it was Hanks easily enough with three of the characters, but the other two did not sound like Hanks at all, though I watched an interview with Hanks and I can tell you that it definitely was Hanks.<br /><br />This movie is filled with subtleties and a lot of fun.  I would rather allow you to watch the movie and discover the treats for yourself.  To tantalize you a little, the train does get to the North Pole, but only after running out of control and nearly sinking under water.  Even after the train gets to the North Pole our heroes end up taking a detour on one of the train cars, ending up somewhere in the heart of an operations center.  Even though I knew this movie was animated, the scene where three children cross a trestle over what appears to be a nearly bottomless pit was a bit tense.<br /><br />This movie is a visual treat throughout, but the visual effects from the point the train appears are spectacular.  The train is extremely detailed as are the animals, plants and people.  The animation is unusual when compared with animation we have seen in the past because of the type of computer animation used.  However, the results are phenomenal.  While the animation did distract me a lot sometimes, after having watched this movie umpteen times (for those who like this message, this movie can be addictive) I can tell you that I keep coming back for the message and not the graphics.<br /><br />This movie was nominated for a bunch of awards, including three Oscars, but it only won four.  I found it interesting that this movie won a Grammy Award for Best Song for a Motion Picture, and yet the Oscar people failed to recognize this movie for any sound awards, though the Oscar people nominated it for several sound awards.<br /><br />I believe that for many people the "Polar Express" will be a holiday favorite and tradition along with the Rankin/Bass classics, "It's a Wonderful Life," and "A Christmas Story."  If you have yet to see this one and you enjoy holiday stories, definitely give this one a try with an open mind and an open heart.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PIX2K56IZZYX.html">A2PIX2K56IZZYX</a><br/><p>Me and the wife just finished "The Polar Express" and we both thought the same thing, that this was one of the most beautifully made movies the two of us have ever seen. I am a Christmas fanatic, and this ranks right up there with some of the all time classics. Why not 5 stars you may ask? Well, simple, as you know, I rarely give 5 stars to any movie or game, and the only Christmas movie I would ever give 5 stars to is 'It's a wonderfull life', answer your question? good, moving on......<br /><br />Tom Hanks does the voices for 5 characters I believe, and he does them pretty well, but you can tell its him in all of them, so thats not so good, but besides that minimal flaw and very few others this CGI miracle is amazing. Now, I am not a huge fan of CG, in fact, I find it ruins alot of decent movies, but not in Polar Express. The CG is breath-taking, the snowstorm is astonishing and the train itself is a wonder to behold. The colors are bright when need be, and quiet and deep in the more emotinal scenes. The 3 main child characters are all delightfull, the only exception being a loud, obnoxious, nerdy kid along for the ride who didn't really fit and was not necessary. If they needed comic relief in the form of a sidekick why not have a dog or even a cat along for the ride, that is always a good fit, especially in a Christmas movie.<br /><br />Another one of my slight flaws is that the expressions on most of the characters don't change much, but it's really not a big deal cuz' you are too busy ooing and awing over every brilliant scene or location. Not only is the train a spectacle but once they arrive at the North Pole, it gets even better. The imagination that went into this is one-of-a-kind. I don't think we are going to see another movie as visually stunning as this in quite a long time.<br /><br />Is this the best CG movie I have ever seen? pretty close race, but I'd give the edge to Nemo, so it gets a strong 2nd place, It's better then both Toy Story's (both are amazing 4 star movies) and a little better then Ice Age or Monsters, Inc. I know there is more of them, but they are mostly 3 stars and below.<br /><br />I do strongly recommend this for any child and there family, I can't wait to watch it again, but I'm going to hold off on buying it.....The special features are suprisingly lacking, no behind the scenes, deleted scenes, bloopers, or anything, so I thinking the re-release will be packed, until next time, take care all.<br /><br />acting..........4 stars, Hanks is solid as usual<br /><br />directing........4.5 stars, Zemecki's vision is amazing<br /><br />special effects.....5 stars, CG at it's best, no equal.....yet<br /><br />kid, comedy rating....4 stars, Some goofy moments, but mostly a pretty serious movie with a strong message<br /><br />quality........4.5 stars, One of the better looking movies ever</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>Great computer graphics in this movie and great message in the power of believing in the true power of Christmas.

Rent "the Polar Express" this holiday season.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"The Polar Express" is an animated film based on Chris Van Allsburg's children's Christmas book. The book is only 29 pages long, and this movie is an hour and 40 minutes, so additional material has been extrapolated from Van Allsburg's story. It tells the tale of a young boy who is beginning to doubt the existence of Santa Claus, flying reindeers, and Christmas magic. He awakes in the middle of the night before Christmas to find that a train, the Polar Express bound for the North Pole, has stopped in front of his house. The conductor persuades the boy to climb aboard, and it's off to the North Pole to see Santa Claus give out the First Gift of Christmas and begin his whirlwind journey to deliver gifts to all the world's children. But not before the boy has some adventures on board the train with the other children passengers.<br /><br />In making "The Polar Express", director Robert Zemeckis wanted to recreate the style of Chris Van Allburg's oil painting that illustrate the book. He needed a method of animating the film that could do that, yet convey subtlety and realism in performances from the actors. Zemeckis used a motion capture system designed by Ken Ralston at Sony Pictures Imageworks, which they called "Performance Capture". The actors are filmed wearing form-fitting "mo-cap" suits studded with reflective markers, which are also applied to their faces, so their body language and expressions can be used as a blueprint for the animation. The amazing thing about this is that the actors' performances are preserved even when their appearance is altered dramatically by the animators. Tom Hanks plays 5 roles in the film, including the little boy protagonist! The little boy looks nothing like Hanks, and yet Hanks was able to physically act the role. Adult actors Nona Gaye, Peter Scolari, and Eddie Deezen also play children. They were filmed against sets 160% normal size to get the scale right for their young characters. Michael Jeter plays both the train engineer and its fireman, one of whom is fat and one skinny.<br /><br />The results of the animation are truly impressive. "The Polar Express" looks like an oil painting come to life. There are some really beautiful scenes. And the characters seem so much like live action characters that I was a little perplexed while I watched it. I thought this must be a live action film shot against a green screen and digitally animated, but I wondered how that was possible with a cast of child actors. Reading about the film afterwards solved the mystery. That must have been some shoot with everyone wearing leotards and Tom Hanks often playing 2 characters in the same scene! In any case, "The Polar Express" is one of the better Christmas movies I've seen, digital effects aside. Adults will enjoy some laugh-out-loud moments and entrancing scenery as well as children. It's bound to become a Christmas classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1WUMTJOASEL5F.html">A1WUMTJOASEL5F</a><br/><p>They are now showing this feature on The Family Channel, courtesy of your local cable company, so I doubt there are many people out there who haven't seen Polar Express at least once. To each his own.<br />You know, offhand, I think it would be very dreary if classic Christmas features began to resemble each other, or imitated each other, simply because there was an isolated working formula that pleased the mass audience. So I am really open to newness and fresh material, because great new features don't really take away from those beloved Christmas classics, but actually keeps the home fires burning.<br />So is with The Polar Express. I don't expect any Christmas fantasy or calamity to embrace all the possible angles of Christmas, but I do expect a heartfelt experiance.<br />Animation films are never required to be logical, and quite frankly, that is the extreme attractiveness of animation in the first place. You can get away with alot. If we demanded animation to be on the planes of logical procedures, Bugs Bunny would have been boiled in a stew in a heartbeat, but he always manages to get out of the most difficult situations, simply by kissing the most hardened foe. . . on the lips. THAT'S COMEDY! So I don't expect features like Polar Express to be entirely logical, just fairly to the point of speculation that IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED LIKE THIS on Christmas Eve.<br />The premise of children even leaving there warm homes into the stone cold with just a bathrobe in itself defies reality comprehension. So as long as I'm in the comfort of my own home watching children baring the winter Christmas Eve cosmos in jamies, is their problem.<br />Now I admit, that having a lone man luring children on to an unknown midnight vehicle is a bit suspicious, especially without talk of consent from their parents to do so, it is a well known fact that Peter Pan himself has used this same sort of scheme with Michael, John, and Wendy.<br />What else is new?<br />For the most part, it is also likely this could have been somewhat of a dream, but like The Wizard Of Oz, it is supposedly not because unlike poor Dorothy who only had Toto as a living witness, our main childhood focus here has a bit of hardcore evidence.<br />My main concern is that throughout all the angles of what if, and why did it happen this way blah, blah, blah. . . I liked this movie. ALOT!<br />It's beautiful to look at like a 3D Christmas traditional card opening up it's telltale magic for all those who want to (yes I'll say it) "Believe".<br />And what more do we need from the land of Christmas anyway?</p></br><a href="../users/AMP7TQRWAIE84.html">AMP7TQRWAIE84</a><br/><p>Enchanting.

Sure, the people aren't perfect but in a few years filmmakers will make it better. The main character reminds me of what Toby Maguire might have looked like as a kid. And the little poor boy looked like a composite of Haley Joel Osment (who sees dead people) and Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey the youngest in Malcolm In The Middle).<br /><br />My favorite part was the the lost ticket flying around and the roller coaster ride. That had to be fun to watch in the theater. What I did find creepy was when the elves was waiting for Santa and they were singing a slow reverent version of "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town". It looked like a cult. Like a bunch of Moonies congregated. Besides that scene, I thought the movie was delightful.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>I found myself saying "wow" over and over as I watched this movie on DVD went it came out just before Thanksgiving of 2005.

The visuals are just stunning, scene after scene.<br /><br />The sound ain't bad, either! Those not playing this on a surround system are missing an integral part of this movie and a lot of fun. The roar of train as it comes and goes, for one example, is awesome.<br /><br />It isn't just the great visuals and audio; the story is extremely entertaining all the way with some very adventurous scenes. There are a couple of roller coaster-type scenes which were especially fun, and actually thrilling.<br /><br /> Normally, 100 minutes is a bit long for me to sit through an animated film but this was filled with so many amazing sights and fun action scenes that time was no problem. Along the way are some touching messages about sharing life with other humans, and about giving.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>I sort of wish I had got the Double Disc edition, but what I did get in the single disc edition was and is so magical, I can honestly say I am more than happy with it.<br /><br />The sound is totally beautiful; if you have a theatre sound system at home, this will be a beautiful watch. Every moment is a precious journey into the heart of a world of "Believe". Tom Hanks and Bob Zemickis must be commended for their roles, and their young actors who voiced that beautiful song done at the end of the train must be commended for such a heart rending performance.<br /><br />The biggest and best step with this journey is decided to get on the train: its a wonderful, beautiful, and sublime experience.</p></br><a href="../users/AM2PV53UX1JEQ.html">AM2PV53UX1JEQ</a><br/><p>I LOVE the book upon which this movie is based, and I love Tom Hanks, and most of his films.  I love Christmas and Santa and have actually played an elf in my life.  So why is this expensive movie so hideously off-target?  Because it has no life, and its vision of Christmas and of the North Pole is of a scary looking place that is cold, distant and has no merriment -- a dreary, hellish, Third-Reich of the North.  And for all of the fuss of the CGI wonderment, only the train, with its rollercoaster thrills, comes to life -- the children and people in this movie look like zombies.  The music is either cheesy, over-the-top new stuff (Hot Chocolate, the strangely uninvolving musical number on the train) or classic Christmas songs that play like music in floating through an old radio on the deserted streets of the North Pole - a place as welcoming as a morgue.  It's a heartless vision that virtually drains the magic from the book, which is elegantly spare and has on its mind only one word: believe. This movie is misguided in nearly every way -- calling into question the artistic judgment of those who created it...what were they thinking?  How can you weave magic without caring about someone, or something?  These characters have no life in their eyes -- and it isn't merely the fault of the animation process (think of any of Disney's classics...the characters are more real than some people!)  I'll stick with Miracle on 34th Street as the ultimate believe-in Santa movie, and I still plan on putting the cookies out this year...</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>This may be the definitive Christmas movie and may become as iconic as Radio City Music Hall's Christmas show. It was filmed in a special process whereby human beings are morphed into cartoon like animatronic beings and the background is partly real, partly imaginary. All of this helps to create the magic and fantasy especially for kids.<br /> Will all children who doubt that Santa Claus exists, but who aren't certain of their certainty, please get on the Polar Express train to test their beliefs? Step aboard with Tom Hanks as the conductor and take a wild ride on Christmas Eve to Santa's hometown. Full of action, very scary sequences, comedy, musical numbers, and a large measure of Christmas sentimentality and bathos, the flick roars along at a fast pace, keeping the kids, and the adults who are still kids at heart, on the edges of their seats. By virtue of computer graphics we see hoards of caribou and countless elves.<br /> The movie is full of magical effects. The train runs off its tracks and goes skidding across a frozen lake with the ice cracking and chasing it. Up in Santa land on the sound track some of the Christmas standbys are sung by the old timers which make it a nostalgic treat for the oldsters watching. This movie brings back a flood of memories and regrets. If only we could go back to the time when we believed. If we could again hear those jingle bells up by the chimney (belief in Santa), how great it would be. Move over, Charles Dickens, you've got a competitor for the Christmas season.</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>This frantically manic madcap would-be disaster epic was not what I expected or wanted The Polar Express to be, and was definitely not what it should have been. I'd go so far as to say this was not all that good of a movie, despite its novel animation and occasional visual brilliance. What frustrates me here is how great this movie could have been and should have been. There is only the slightest connection between this movie and the plot of the much better short book that goes by the same name. Also would it have killed the filmmakers to have stuck with the characters from the book as written and drawn instead of turning this beloved classic into some sort of misguided effort at furthering "diversity" in America? Just a very disappointing film from every aspect.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M5FI4CB6VUXF.html">A2M5FI4CB6VUXF</a><br/><p>Either you get on the train or you don't... And as long as you continue to get on the train, you'll grasp the meaning of Christmas. The TRUE meaning of Christmas. But you have to be willing to get on.<br /><br />This movie was a great adaptation of the classic story. I must admit I was a tad bit wigged out by the animation. It was just oogey in some ways. Realistic at times and, at other times, so unbelievably fake...<br /><br />I couldn't decide if I liked the animation or not. Still can't. But the story itself is worth the struggle I had with the animation.<br /><br />Get on board! You'll be glad you did.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Based on the book of the same name by Chris Van Allsburg, it's something of a mystery why The Polar Express did not connect with audiences when it was released in theatres last year. Perhaps people weren't ready to accept that kind of animation yet - at least not until it looks a bit more realistic. Regardless, Robert Zemeckis' film certainly has all the right ingredients for a classic children's Christmas movie: a timeless message, dazzling visuals, exciting action sequences and universal characters that anyone can relate to.<br /><br />The film contains some of the most impressive computer animation this side of Pixar except that it is not done in a caricature style but rendered as realistically as possible, much like Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. However, despite the state-of-the-art CGI, the facial expressions of the characters aren't quite as fully or realistically animated as in hand-drawn animation. They aren't able to accurately render wrinkles on a person's face. They still look too smooth and waxy with the hair looking rather plastic-like. However, the rendering of shadows and light, like a shot of the train stopped by the side of the road, the warm light of its interiors casting shadows on the snow covered ground while flakes of snow fall gently from the sky, looks very impressive indeed. Each scene is elaborately rendered with so much detail that you could pause any frame and spend a good amount of time marveling at all the work that went into this movie.<br /><br />The first disc features a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with "You Look Familiar," a featurette on the many faces of Tom Hanks. He ended up playing five different characters and worked entirely on blue screen sets while wearing a motion capture suit and very little props or other actors to interact with.<br /><br />"A Genuine Ticket to Ride" explores, briefly, the source material and how the filmmakers were able to adapt it through digital technology known as performance capture. This featurette takes us through the technical aspects of the filmmaking process in easy to understand terms.<br /><br />"The Inspirations: An Author's Adventure" takes a look at author Chris Van Allsburg. He got his start as a sculptor but moved on to drawings when it became too expensive to buy supplies.<br /><br />"Josh Groban at the Greek" is a music video of the singer performing "Believe" at the famous venue interspersed with clips from the movie.<br /><br />"Behind the Scenes of `Believe'" takes a look at how the song came together and what it meant to those involved - clearly it was a labour of love.<br /><br />"Polar Express Challenge" is a game that has you steer the train across the frozen lake to safety and then you have to help Santa deliver presents to deserving children and coal to the bad ones.<br /><br />"Meet the Snow Angels" features key cast and crew members talking about their warmest memories of Christmas and the best gift they ever got.<br /><br />Finally, there is an "Additional Song", a deleted scene between Smokey and Steamer that was actor Michael Jeter's last musical performance before he died.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Robert Zemecki's take on the popular children's classic is a visually stunning and heartwarming tale of faith and belief.  Though the story itself is somewhat thin, the animation is brilliant.  Never has animation seemed so lifelike, with loving detail to character movements and gorgeous alpine scenics.  Tom Hanks lends his brilliant vocal characterizations and physical appearance to several roles, most notably the conductor and the mysterious hobo.  He is of course also the embodiment if not the voice of the hero boy.  The movie's message is clear:  if you believe, then everything is magically possible.  The trip to the North Pole is fraught with misadventures and once there, the magic of the landscape and the North Pole is breathtakingly captured.  Alan Silvestri contributes a fine score even if the BELIEVE song is a little maudlin, but deemed Oscar worthy as performed by Josh Groban.  Nona Gaye also does nice work as the hero girl and Eddie Deezen is a great know it all.  In time, I think this groundbreaking joy will be a Christmas classic.  The whole family should enjoy this one.</p></br><a href="../users/APIW11UEPKIC2.html">APIW11UEPKIC2</a><br/><p>A young boy is sitting in bed Christmas Eve and all that he can think about is how fake Santa is.  Well, he will soon learn the truth.  In the middle of the night the Polar Express shows up right in front of his house.  The boy can't help but get on this magical train that is heading for the north pole.  From here on it is a rollercoaster ride, and some times even more fun than a rollercoaster.  The animation is definitely something I could not look away from and is so lifelike you forget you are watching an animated movie at times.  The only flaws in the film are a some what creepy scene with a bum who lives on the top of the train and then there is your standard animation movie singing scene.  But they were good singers I guess.<br /><br />Now if you remember reading this book as a little kid like me than you will not be dissapointed one bit.  The main thing I remember was the book had a great ending I actually liked the movie ending more!</p></br><a href="../users/A1C9GCHR99WX3F.html">A1C9GCHR99WX3F</a><br/><p>If you love Christmas movies, or animated movies, then this movie should really excite you, it combines Christmas and animation all into one. And if you are a big Tom Hanks fan, then this should really get you happy, he is cast in 5 roles in the movie, so there wouldb't be to many scenes without Tom Hanks. The movie also has the voices of Jimmy Bennett, Eddie Deezen, and the late Michael Jeter. The movie set up is this, on Christmas Eve a train stops in front of boys and girl's house that cause trouble, or start doubting the existance of Santa Claus (Tom Hanks) and takes them to the North Pole to meet Santa, and he picks one child to get the first present. So it is the night of Christmas Eve, a tain pulls up the hero Boy's (Tom Hanks again) house, the train's Conductor gets out to greet him, and every child's house they stop, the boy asks to where, and the Conductor says the North Pole, of course the boy doesn't want to get on, but changes his mind in time before he leaves his house. On the train is other children including Hero Girl (Nona Gaye, daughter of the late singer Marvin Gaye). The conductor takes the children's ticket, which somehow magical appears. But forgets about the hero girl, but when Hero Boy discovers the ticket, the boy loses the ticket, and the conductor takes the girl away.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>"The Polar Express" is the story of an unnamed boy who does not believe in Santa anymore.  On Christmas Eve night, while lying in bed, hears a train outside his window.  When goes outside to see what it is, he finds the Polar Express, which is on its way to the North Pole.  So begins his adventure.  Along the way, he will meet other children, a mysterious hobo, and have some amazing adventures, before arriving at the North Pole in time to see Santa off on the busiest night of his year.<br /><br />"The Polar Express" is both impressive and disappointing at the same time.  The characters are animated using motion capture performance, mostly done by Tom Hanks.  The characters look somewhat real, but are just enough off to look creepy at times (specifically the little girl, the elves, and the waiters).  The movements seem a little odd at times, and that is difficult to explain because they are based on real movements.  Perhaps it is just the animation.  The overall animation is impressive though.  The Polar Express and North Pole are fully realized in all their glorious detail.<br /><br />The songs are unmemorable, but the performances by Tom Hanks are good.  He gives life to numerous characters, some of them children, in such a way that you believe that they seem real and true to their age.  The story has been modified from the book in order to accomidate a longer running time, and it works to some extent.  The movie moves swiftly for the most part.<br /><br />In the end, "The Polar Express" will probably become a childrens' holiday classic.  I would not call it the best Christmas movie ever, but more likely than not, children will find enjoyment in the story of a child who learns to believe again.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Until the buzz surrounding THE POLAR EXPRESS started about six months ago, I had never heard of the children's book the movie is based upon.  Therefore, I had never read the book when I watched the movie.  I just want to get that out in the open to begin with.<br /><br />I enjoyed THE POLAR EXPRESS. It's an entertaining movie with a lot of profound themes that, though dressed up in the finest that humanism has to offer, are really deeply religious in nature.  Nevertheless, even if one is unable to extrapolate those spiritual nuances, the movie offers enough visual eye candy and action to make it worth watching and, despite the film's criticism, it is destined to become a Christmas classic.<br /><br />The movie revolves around the adventures that arrive at a young boy's house on Christmas Eve. The boy is never given a name and is listed in the credits as Hero Boy.  The Hero Boy is at a critical time in his life: he is on the verge of adolescence and is having serious doubts about the existence of Santa Claus.  He lies in his bed on Christmas Eve listening for the sound of reindeer bells. However, instead of bells his ears are greeted by a sound unexpected, that of a train whistle.  As he looks out the window and opens the front door, he is greeted by a splendid engine pulling a train called The Polar Express. He's invited aboard by the Conductor. At first he hesitates, but then chooses to ride.  And thus begins a somewhat harrowing journey that takes the boy from the top of the moving train, across a frozen lake, and all the way to the top of the world at the North Pole.<br /><br />The animation in THE POLAR EXPRESS is at times amazingly realistic.  There are times in the movie where one cannot tell at all that this is a cartoon. Non-living objects are the ones that are consistently most brilliant.  There are times when it is clear that the characters are cartoons and not actors, but almost all of the nonanimate objects from presents, to hot chocolate, to the engine of The Polar Express itself look completely real. When presented in the moments when the human characters appear least "real" it is as though we are watching some strange world akin to WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT.<br /><br />There are several moments in the movie where the main characters partake in dangerous situations that should in no way ever be attempted in real life. Younger children might find these scenes frightening. However, in the tale the film tells, the adventures are needed.  Every hero lives a life of adventure full of danger and the life lived to the fullest is one in which danger cannot be avoided.<br /><br />I did finally read the book by Chris Van Allsburg a few days after seeing the film.  The book is full of incredible illustrations but is also very short (32 pages).  I felt that the filmmakers did a wonderful job of expanding upon the pages of Van Allsburg's writing and illustrations. I felt that the film also did a great job of staying true to the spirit of the book, presenting the message of the book in a way that gives it even more meaning, depth, and interpretaion.<br /><br />The children's book is a simple tale about a boy's struggle to believe in Santa Claus and how he came to believe. It's a message the children love and brings back nostalgia and causes reflection in adults.  The movie was created in such a way that this message is seriously expanded. The simple tale becomes a profound allegory of faith. There are messengers (the Conductor). There companions who believe (Hero Girl), disbelieve (Know-It-All), and are profoundly confused (Lonely Boy).  There is the Jesus-figure (Santa) and his often unseen angels (elves).  And there is also Satan (Hobo), who is allowed to ride along for the ride and tempt.  Much more could be said about the religous implications of the film, but these illustrations make the point.<br /><br />Overall, THE POLAR EXPRESS is an entertaining movie. It's a different kind of Christmas movie, but one with enough substance and charm that ensure it will become a Christmas classic.  All you have to do is believe.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>Santa Claus is a tough sell. You can't cause him too much peril, because, ... well, because he's Santa Claus. In "The Polar Express", the only conflict that exits is the threat of losing your belief, in Santa Claus. Adults may add their own metaphor. No evil plot to conquer The North Pole, no reindeer catastrophe, no elves picketing for better working conditions, no, this is serious Santa. What we all understand about the famous, "Yes, Virginia, There Is A Santa Claus", newspaper editorial, (it's always been my cynical belief that a brilliant editor made up the letter), is laid out here in bloated bubble-gum fashion. Somehow wallowed in the sentiments and styles of the first half of the 20th Century, the film is about a magical train to The North Pole, and if nothing else, they got the transport right, sometimes the train ride to Santa Land is as redundant as a train ride to Buffalo.<br /><br />"The Polar Express" is filmed with animated real actors, apparently playing opposite a 'blue screen', and then swallowed up by it, like that dreadful Aha! video from decades ago, and the effect is like a more mature, thoughtful Gumby, or a decrepit Davy and Goliath, (it was a clay-motion religious children's show in the early '60's, and those who have seen it will never be the same.) Great care is given to detail the facial psychological grimaces of the boy who hops aboard The Polar Express, to see for himself if Santa is real, but the 'extra' kids on the train, seem ridiculously unable to react or interplay with the few speaking characters with dialogue, like if they spoke, the producers would have to pay them imaginary scale, or the animators would have to move their mouths. When a magical train ticket, (nothing is left un-magic-ized), is lost out the window of the train to the wind, the film uses exquisite filming technique to record its journey up mountains, down rivers, free-falling and swirling in snow squalls, and it is a very nice, worthless to the story, bit of Fantasia. Likewise, the boxcar tramp who appears to the boy in times of peril, like a cowboy from heaven, is a nice touch, but the idea, like the tramp, disappears in a puff of smoke.<br /><br />The final North Pole Christmas climax extravaganza, looked to me, given its 1940's heart, like a horrific German youth for Hitler rally, with thousands of elves dominating the city, (mean mothers, too), like a Karl Marx industrial nightmare, and what seemed an entire civilization vowing allegiance to dictator Santa.<br /><br />Suffice to say, "The Polar Express" doesn't compare to the humblest Christmas pageants, say, TV's "Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer", which seems to have the same earnest warm Christmas thoughts in mind, and accomplishes the sentiment that The Polar Express, all lights flashing, and whistles blowing, roars through. Will kids like this movie? I think they will. Will they hold it precious through their lives? There's the rub.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ADG449ZNEO6Y.html">A1ADG449ZNEO6Y</a><br/><p>The Polar Express heralded a brave new world of all-digital filmmaking. Critics and audiences were divided between those who hailed it as an instant classic that captures the visual splendor and evocative innocence of Chris Van Allsburg's popular children's book, and those who felt that the innovative use of "performance capture"--to accurately translate live performances into all-digital characters--was an eerie and not-quite-lifelike distraction from the story's epic-scale North Pole adventure. In any case it's a kind-hearted celebration of the yuletide spirit, especially for kids who have almost grown out of their need to believe in Santa Claus. Tom Hanks is the nominal "star" who performs five different computer-generated characters, but it's the visuals that steal this show, as director Robert Zemeckis indulges his tireless pursuit of technological innovation.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>The POLAR EXPRESS is the picture of the year in IMAX 3-D.  I can't imagine how it might look any other way.  The compositions would be the same, but the dimensionality of the movie really floors you, knocks you out, and I think perhaps the 3-effects help you enjoy Alan Silvestri's music more, even down to the magical sleighbells that our little hero cannot hear.<br /><br />The songs are to be cherished.  I couldn't make out the lyrics of the choral number, "The Spirit of the Season," but it is something I would like to have the choir in my church sing during their rehearsals for the Nutcracker Suite.  One of my favorite music numbers is the bizarre, minimal "Hot Chocolate" barked out by Tom Hanks and a chorus of singing waiters in a take off of an old Cotton Club/Cab Calloway style.  Hanks really doesn't have a good singing voice, does he, and he's straining himself trying to get through a number even where all he has to say is, "Hot, hot," a dozen times.  In general when Hanks was off the screen I liked the movie better.  I couldn't help but think that he was hogging up all the action by trying to put his brand on every male character in the show, right down to the evil Scrooge puppet, and trying to play one character and the father to that character is stupid, if you ask me, but they say Warner Brothers paid him $25 million dollars to play in the show, so maybe they figured they would milk him for all he's worth.  Peter Sellers used to play many characters-and Alec Guinness-I didn't like it when they did it either, to tell you the truth.<br /><br />Steven Tyler from Aerosmith has a few cute moments as an elf singing, "Rocking On Top Of The World."<br /><br />The movie has you in tears from approximately 40:15 on.  When the little black girl and the poor boy who's afraid of Christmas disappointment, get together at the back of the club car and sing, "When Christmas Comes To Town," it is the signal to unleash all the tears you've ever wanted to shed about the world's injustice and also the beauty of the world that the young girl seems to be arguing in favor of.  If the Christmas season can produce such wonderful feelings of love, then it is a shame it cannot last all year.</p></br><a href="../users/A8DI0COTCMRDV.html">A8DI0COTCMRDV</a><br/><p>Robert Zemeckis's "THE POLAR EXPRESS" is !GROUNDBREAKING! Its one of the best christmas movies i've seen in a very long time! Its a new christmas classic without a doubt! A very fun ride!</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>As to its stunning visuals, we can see no disagreement among us.  'The Polar Express' has shown where the CGIs would be leading us in the future.  However, as to its story and, well, the virtual star Tom Hanks (who looks and moves in a very weird way), there is still room for improvement to be done.  All in all I liked the film simply because I love to see newer things on the big screen.  But if you are kind of audiences who would feel dizzy after watching the flood of CGIs, you may consider buying the original book (and that's beautiful) instead.<br /><br />The original book by Chris Van Allsburg contains only 29 pages, and for the film (that runs 100 mins), Robert Zemeckis stretched the story.  Maybe he did it too much, but anyway the film follows one boy (voiced by Daryl Sabara, the kid of 'The Spy Kids') who lost his faith in Santa.  But one Christmas Eve, an old-fashioned train led by a steam locomotive stops right in front of his window.  It's The Polar Express, and The Conductor invites him to board the train to join in the travel to the North Pole.<br /><br />The rest of the story needs no summery; The Hero Boy meets new friends, sees the elves (including one cameo played by Steven Tyler), and, yes, the man in red clothes, with white beard.  The voice cast include Tom Hanks (playing five roles), Michael Jitter (playing two roles Smokey and Steamer), Norah Gaye as Hero Girl, and Peter Scolari as Lonely Boy.<br /><br />But the merit of the film is mostly the visuals (not those of humans, which, quite annoyingly, often look embalmed bodies in motion).  The snow-covered railroad track, the icy field on which the train slips as if skating, and the well-crafted designs of the town in the North Pole are all fantastic.  If only Tom Hanks appeared exactly as he is, without tampered by the 'performance capture' system (whatever it is).<br /><br />The sound effects are amazing, the songs are pretty good, but the fact remains that 'The Paolar Express' is based on a very thin book -- you know what I mean if you remember 'Jumanji' which was another film based on Chrs Van Allsburg's book.  Great images with very few things to say, that's my verdict.  And very bizarre Tom Hanks, more bizarre than him in 'The Ladykillers.'</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>A criticism leveled at a currently running holiday movie, CHRISTMAS WITH THE KRANKS, is that Jesus is mentioned nowhere in the plot. THE POLAR EXPRESS, a much superior film, doesn't either. (Just so you know if you care about such things.) THE POLAR EXPRESS is all about childhood belief in Santa Claus and getting presents. If, like me, you don't particularly care much anymore (Bah humbug!) about Santa and presents, the film represents an extraordinary achievement in animation and motion-capture technology. And, it's great fun.<br /><br />The plot is simple. On Christmas Eve, a young boy finds himself doubting the existence of Santa even as he gazes at the ornamented tree and the cookies and moo laid out for jolly St. Nick. He goes to sleep suspecting that Dad is the real benefactor. In any case, he's awakened in the middle of the night by the steam-belching locomotive of the Polar Express, which has pulled to a stop in the street. After some initial hesitation, our young hero climbs aboard for a wild ride to the North Pole where his belief in Santa may (or may not) be resurrected.<br /><br />This film, insofar as it uses real actors to provide the voiceovers and the substrate for the motion-capture effects, is virtually a one man show for Tom Hanks, who "plays" the Boy Hero, his father, the train's conductor, a mysterious hobo, a Scrooge puppet, and Santa himself. (The Boy Hero's voice is provided by Daryl Sabra. Tom doesn't do soprano.) You'd think the Screen Actor's Guild would protest the reduction in actors required to meet casting requirements.<br /><br />As an exercise in motion-capture, THE POLAR EXPRESS is an intriguing glimpse at what may be the future of the motion picture industry. As seen in this film, they haven't quite yet got the technique down perfect. The human movements are faintly unnatural - perhaps a greater concentration of motion sensors are needed on the real life actor's skin. And the eyes are sometimes downright creepy. (If my wife showed up with such orbs, I'd search the Yellow Pages for "exorcist".) The animation of the animals in the film is, however, superlative, as evidenced by a breathtaking sequence of a running pack of wolves that left me positively delighted.<br /><br />I'm awarding five stars for the incredibly detailed visuals. It's a small thing, but I was entranced, for example, by the swirling vortices of ice flakes created by the train's passage through a snowstorm as framed by the rear door of the last passenger car. I find it amazing and commendable that the film's creators would think to include such an esoteric detail.<br /><br />It's been predicted in some quarters that THE POLAR EXPRESS will become a Yuletide season classic. That it would ever replace IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is doubtful. Tom Hanks, as phenomenal as he is, is no Jimmy Stewart. And THE POLAR EXPRESS doesn't have even a fraction of the warm fuzziness. But the latter is at the top of its genre, as I'm sure the next Oscar awards will recognize.</p></br><a href="../users/A155KXFRZCA7C.html">A155KXFRZCA7C</a><br/><p>With this film, Christmas has officially started. This flick is a first-class CGI animation adventure. The story, for those who don't know, is about a boy who has somewhat lost the magic of believing in Santa Claus and is dreaming of visiting the North Pole to find out. On Christmas eve the magical "Polar Express" stops in front of his house and invites him to join the ride to the North Pole. The journey is fantastic and often it feels like a roller coaster going up and down step scenic mountains over a frozen lake, etc. to the final destination of the city of North Pole where elfs and Santa reside working around the clock to get everything ready for Christmas. The story also involves various characters from the lonely outcast boy to the caring little girl to the selfish little brat and so on. It's a relaxing Christmas adventure for the whole family with lots of drama,but with happy endings. Take your kids to see this film as it will get you into the Christmas mood.

This is a great movie, mainly, because of its breathtaking and mersmerizing animation. it is a techinque that hasn't been done before.Robert Zemckis took a real risk and it payed off because this film is excellent. The only problem I had with this movie was that Tom Hanks did too many voices. They could've branched out and could've had some other actors to do the other voices. \<br /><br />The film is about a boy whose name is not said, is in bed on christmas eve and he rubs off off of us as a non-beliver of Santa. He, all the sudden, feels a rumbling and see lights, and he gets his robe on and goes out to look, it is The Polar Express, with Tom Hanks as The Conductor waiting to take him and a large amount of kids to the North Pole. He goes on the journey to the north pole and along the way He meets a ghost hobo, a boy afraid of christmas, a boy that is a smarty pants, and a girl that becomes his friend for the film and helps him make it through the movie. The movie is literally a roller coster ride, there are so many twist and turns on the way that you feel that you are riding along with them. This movie stays so true to the book, you won't belive it. Most movies base itself on the books! The ending made me tearful to know that Hero Boy now belived in Santa. That got me.<br /><br />Robert has a great movie on his hands. Yet another great collaberation with Tom Hanks, that is full of Christmas cheer, imagination, and fun. Go see this movie a lot, and see it near Christmas time if it is still in movie theathers.

I would suggest a rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A33IZJVCKFKDPU.html">A33IZJVCKFKDPU</a><br/><p>First off, Robert Zemeckis is one of the most creative movie minds in the business.  He has always been way ahead in movie technology.  Whether it was Back To The Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, or Forrest Gump, Zemeckis has always been where the future technology is.  And the same goes for The Polar Express, which is a visual masterpiece... and an okay story.<br /><br />This children's Christmas story is about boy named Billy, who doesn't believe in Santa Claus.  So on Christmas Eve, a train named The Polar Express comes to pick him up and takes him on a journey to the North Pole. There he meets Santa Claus and believes in the Christmas spirit once again.  Thats basically the gist of the story.<br /><br />As stated earlier, the visual effects are amazing in this movie.  Zemeckis used a motion capture device, the same thing that video game creators use in sports games.  Everything from the train ride to the design of the North Pole (which is the best visual part of the movie) is purely amazing.  Also, Tom Hanks (oh yeah, he's in the movie) plays five different characters.  Everyone from Billy to the train conductor to Santa Claus himself, are Tom Hanks' facial and body movements.  The story itself is ok.  The major problem is that Zemeckis tried really hard to stretch a book that was only about 30 pages long into an hour and forty minute long movie, and some scenes are really stretched out to fill in time.<br /><br />My overall opinion is that this was a good movie, but nothing particularly special.  The only thing special are the effects.  But this is still a good holiday movie for the family and I would reccommend that you take your family or loved one to see this movie.  Maybe the Christmas spirit in you will be rejuvenated, but probably not.</p></br><a href="../users/A3USRUCHAOC3MT.html">A3USRUCHAOC3MT</a><br/><p>Are you looking for a holiday movie that is uplifting?

So there are a lot of exciting scenes of the train/children on roller coaster tracks that are enjoyable and breath-taking but do not contribute to the story. By the end, it seemed a little too much. But not enough to take away from the story.<br /><br />Tom Hanks is excellent in the several roles he takes during the movie. The special effects live up to their name. And I like it when special effects are a thing of beauty as they are here, as opposed to being used for ugliness as they are in horror movies.<br /><br />I will always say this. I don't believe children should watch movies or TV without the accompaniment of their parents, regardless of the rating. This allows the parents to be in the habit of knowing what their children are watching and provide opportunities to take advantage of teachable moments. But this is definitely family fare.<br /><br />Let me close with comments from my particular world-view, which is Christian. One plus side is that it shows belief as an important source of joy in a person's life, as any Christian can testify. Two dangers. 1) Is the emphasis having faith rather than the object of faith? 2) Is faith seen as independent of reality/reason? There are other things that might make some Christians uncomfortable -- it almost seems Santa's being worshipped by the elves.<br /><br />The caveats I mention should not keep you from enjoying this excellent fantasy.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>The theme of this film - believing in the xmass spirit - didn't quite work with me.  I watched this with my kids and while they enjoyed it, they though a lot of it was rather strange.  First there is the spookiness of certain aspects of the train, like the bum who seems to live on the roof and appears at dangerous moments.  Then there are the sudden flights on huge hills or around the town at the N pole.  The kids are suddenly in an adventure that you know is destined to turn out OK, so they are there to use the special effects and maintain interest.  (The technical quality is also low, with wooden movements by the characters and gestures that don't look all that real, though perhaps we are now spoilt by Avatar.)  Finally, you get the xmass themes, but they are weirdly done, with creepy-looking elves you don't know you can trust.<br /><br />The best part of the film are the personalities of the kids, in particular the 3 principles.  There is a skeptical boy, a lonely black child, and an inhibited kid who probably comes from an unhappy or dysfunctional household.  They do interact well, even if they don't quite look alive.  You do feel some of the magic of xmass thru their eyes.<br /><br />I would recommend this tepidly.  It isn't awful, but I would never say it is great.</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>This movie is bound to be a holiday classic!!! I was totally blown away watching this movie. It is a very simple but also a complex movie with only one message and that is "believe". If you believe in something strong enough, you will get what you want. You can't get anything in life if you don't believe in what you want, so "believe". Not knowing anything about this movie before I watched it except that it is a christmas movie, I was totally suprised that it didn't have this "religious" statement attached to it. I commend the author and director of this movie for that "freedom". I highly recommend this movie to everyone that wants to watch a very moving movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AXV9GS0TMSVW.html">AXV9GS0TMSVW</a><br/><p>As a book, the Polar Express is a modern Christmas classic.  I was both ecstactic and sceptical to hear it would be turned into a feature film.  Picture books don't tend to translate well to feature length films (See Jumanji, Cat in the Hat, the Grinch).  Yet the team behind this guaranteed that care would be given to the treatment of the material.<br /><br />Care is given to the material.  The world of the film is true to the world of the book.  Attention is given to little things such as being able to see the wolves from the train.  The theme is that of innocence, and if you're looking for a film that encapsulates innocence, look no further.  Zemekis and crew do a fantastic job of illustrating the innocence of children at Chrismastime.  This film has a lot of spirit going for it.  And by far, it is the most innocent, 100% kid friendly movie I've seen in recent memory.<br /><br />The filmmakers take some liberties.  Notably in adding some conflict, such as difficulties in reaching the North Pole, creating some side characters, and adding more depth to the North Pole that is featured ever so briefly in the book.  The best addition is easily the homeless man who appears only to the Hero boy on top of the train.  The worst has to be some awkward decisions about the North Pole.  Sorry, but the ultra futuristic look and Santa's rainbow whip kinda turned me off.<br /><br />Then there is the design.  This movie looks specatacular - in 3D.  And if you see this in Imax 3D, it is a breathtaking experience.  However, on DVD the 3D experience is not there to reveal the film's many shortcomings.  For one, "oohs" and "ahs" of the 3D experience are replaced with the filmmakers attempts to stretch the story into a 100 minute feature.  Furthermore, the supposedly groundbreaking "acting" in the film makes the people's movements seem awkward.  While the actual character designs are fine (though I would probably reconsider some of the facial expressions in the film), the movements do not allow you to suspend yourself in disbelief.  The final blow is the film's music.  The score is fine, which seems to recall Silversti's own Back to the Future, while also recalling another winter based score, Danny Elfman's score to Edward Scissorhands.  Sadly, the same can't be said for the film's songs, which lack the immediacy and poignancy of Disney's animated features.<br /><br />Overall, the Polar Express is a great family film that fares better on the big screen than on the small one.  On the small screen, the story moves slowly and the visuals don't come to life nearly as well as they do on the huge Imax screen.  Zemekis and all involved capture the innocence of the book perfectly, but can't stretch the theme of the story to keep us sustained for 100 minutes.  Catch it at the Imax in 3D or read the book.  As a stand alone film at home, it may be a snoozer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3SXHT6RBV81.html">A2F3SXHT6RBV81</a><br/><p>Adapted from a classic children's book written by Chris Van Allsburg to the screen using computerized technology about a train ride to the North Pole, an expensive process but well worth the visual effects.  This was a complete Tom Hanks film using software to match his voice and mannerisms to many varied roles.  I liked him best as the conductor who punched letters into the children's tickets, return punches would complete a word -- each different to match their personalities and needs.<br /><br />There is a lovely snow scene in Grand Rapids, Michigan, at 11 p.m. on Christmas Eve when the mysterious steam engine arrived in the boy's own front yard with effects (shaking and noise) similar to an earthquake.  A skeptic about the validity of Santa Claus, he'd already looked in the World Book encyclopedia to read about the North Pole never thinking he'd travel there in less than an hour.  The boy was a lot like Brett (age 9) as he watched the mechanical Santa in a store window as the train went past.<br /><br />It is a magic train, all alight in several cars but the children, dressed in sleepware, sat in one car except for Billy.  A sad little boy who'd never received Christmas gifts, he sat by himself in the caboose.<br /><br />There were tapdancing waiters who served refreshments.  The hot chocolate left a brown mustache (like the while 'milk' one) on each child.  A lost ticket, swirling in the wind, lands amid a wolf pack; with the help of a bald eagle, it magically found its way back inside the train.<br /><br />That's only the beginning.  Boy discovers the hobo who calls himself the 'king of the train' on top of a coach car and they ski (cross-country style) to the engine where he jumps into the coal car.  He thought he was asleep and dreaming in the swirling snow.<br /><br />The hobo imprints on his mind that 'seeing is believing.'  But after a harrowing escape from the breaking ice after the train jackknives and slithers to safety, he learns that 'sometimes the most real things in the world are those we cannot see.'<br /><br />Inside the cab of the locomotive, he blows the whistle, and the train has to stop as deer are all over the tracks.  It seems that the engineer could talk Karibo when his long red hair is pulled.  Both engineers were comical characters as played by Michael Jeter.<br /><br />The music was magnificent as they take a wild ride down the mountain like a roller coaster.  We witness optical illusions with the Northern Lights at the Arctic Circle.  The tramp turns out to be a puppeteer with a marionette of Scrooge (bah, humbug), both patterned after Tom Hanks.<br /><br />At the North Pole, we see a lighted Christmas tree even taller than our National tree in Washington, D.C. or that at Rockefeller Center in New York City.  Three children are separated from the group and endure another wild ride on the curvy tracks around this city of lights in the runaway caboose.<br /><br />There appears to Boy a ghost of the hobo offering a nice hot 'cup of Joe' before they are stranded on a train turntable.  After a perilous walk to the tunnel, they find Santa's workshop in a cul-de-sac (dead end).<br /><br />The lost children had adventures galore in the inner workings of the labyrinth and see all the 'good of Christmas.'  If you see only one Christmas movie this year, let this be it.  A delight for the whole family, it can't be beat for having Christmas spirit -- plus appropriate music.<br /><br />Bing Crosby's version of 'White Christmas' is playing as the mountain of gifts is lifted from an open observatory like Kitt Peak in Arizona and floated over the lighted city in a hot air balloon.  The 'flying eleves' ("kids, do not try this at home," directed the conductor) sky-dived as the enormous bundle is loaded onto Santa's sleigh.  It takes some bungie-jumping to put the star on the tall tree.<br /><br />As long trumpets herald the arrival of St. Nick, the prancing reindeer are a sight to behold.  It's as if we were in the Land of Oz with all the munchkins.  Santa's blue eyes were like those I remarked on recently when I talked with a 'Victorian Santa' at the East Tennessee History Center.<br /><br />Santa explains his gifts: first, you must 'believe'; one child received a 'smidgin of humility'; another, "no greater gift than friendship."  He tells everyone that "the true spirit of Christmas is in your heart."  His fiber-optic reindeer whip made the tall tree magical.<br /><br />The Polar Express returns and they leave the city of lights as they head for home amid thick snow flakes and sparkling icycles.  The children are told that "it doesn't matter where a train is going; what matters is to decide to get on."  Under the tree on Christmas morning is an old fashioned truck toy (which dates the story) and a harlequin doll like the one I have for Eric, age 4.  Santa had gift-wrapped and delivered his special present, The Christmas Bell.<br /><br />Our local excursion train, the Rambler, is taking a Polar Express this Christmas on its regular route with readings of this book as special entertainment.  A giant step (I've been on these trips at different times of the Spring, Summer and Fall.), but this time it's 'reservation only.'<br /><br />Completed in only 56 days as a result of the computer technology (rapid progress), I predict this will become a classic like Burl Ives' 'Frosty the Snowman' and 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.'  An uplifting story.</p></br><a href="../users/A11ED8O95W2103.html">A11ED8O95W2103</a><br/><p>I just watched this movie version of the classic childrens' book with my wife.  Here are my gut impressions:<br /><br />First, very little is true to the book.  That's not really a gut impression.  That's the impression I got hearing my wife say "That's not in the book...that's not in the book..."<br /><br />Actually this movie is more like a computer animation demo than a vehicle for story telling.  It makes for beautiful stills and pictures, and those made me want to see the movie.<br /><br />I expected a heart warming Christmas story, and what I got was about an hour of frantic scenes of out-of-control railroad and other technology animated like never before with just enough pauses betwen them to remind me why I'm watching.  You get to see...<br /><br />A kid chasing a ticket through a train,<br /><br />A kid chasing a ticket over the roof of a train,<br /><br />A ticket making its way through the forest -- Rube Goldberg style -- back to the train,<br /><br />(Forty minutes into this movie and one girl's train ticket is the star of the show!)<br /><br />OK, the ticket sub plot is resolved and we have...<br /><br />A train sliding out of control on the ice,<br /><br />A train trying to outrun cracks on the ice,<br /><br />A train going full throttle out of control and racing up and down mountain valleys like a roller coaster (fans of the "coaster tycoon" series of computer games will feel right at home) until finally it arrives at the North Pole.<br /><br />Then, the train car with the central character kids gets detached so we have...<br /><br />A train car running out of control through Santa's village,<br /><br />Kids getting lost in the Christmas present manufacturing plant and falling through the chutes and machinery of the factory, and then...<br /><br />Kids getting lost in a bag of presents that is taken by a flying machine to Santa's sled launching pad where the star at the top of the tree is dislodged and nearly impales an innocent elf.  Ho ho ho.<br /><br />At least let me have a joystick and a couple of buttons so I can help these kids out!  It's like a computer animated train wreck in fast motion.  You know it's awful but you can't look away!<br /><br />And, you'd better think twice before letting any very young children see this.  It could be very frightening on a big screen with the volume turned up.  My wife and I were going to watch it with our three and six year old sons, and we were very glad that we didn't.<br /><br />So, what could have been a classic, enduring, and endearing compliment to a classic childrens' Christmas story is little more than a great line for some computer animator to have on his or her resume.  Two thirds of this movie is devoted to stuff that doesn't advance the story or develop the characters one bit.  Whatever a "character driven" story is, this is the opposite.  Never have I seen so many rendered pixels doing so much and accomplishing so little.<br /><br />I'd rather set up my old American Flyer electric trains and let them run around the tree while I read the book to my kids.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P6NRWDD1NT4B.html">A1P6NRWDD1NT4B</a><br/><p>A milestone in cinema computer animation production. However, with all the technology, the bottom line of any film is an interesting and original storyline.  THE POLAR EXPRESS is wrought with predictability and dullness.  The audience knows the train is headed for the north pole to end up at Santa's villiage and work shop. The audience knows the main character is going to hop on the train, meet up with a bunch of precocious children (Eddie Deezen's --1941, GREASE, I WANNA HOLD YOUR HAND-- annoying voice is the most recognizable of the bunch)and other uninteresting characters (i.e. the train conductor, the hobo etc). The audience knows that somehow the main child character will end up meeting Santa Clause and change his disbelief. Lastly, the plot device of whether this is a dream or reality is a tired cliche done in movies from THE WIZARD OF OZ to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. To get back to the technology and animation technique, it takes its look from a children's story book by Chris Van Allsburg. Then the actor's motion and facial expressions are transcribed into a computer program and given the cgi treatment etc. However, it looks haunting, dark, and creepy especially once the Polar Express reaches Santa's village and the townspeople and elves appear.  It looks like a bunch of people being sent off to concentration camps. Overall...Overrated!! Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis have a pretty good track record of great films, but this is a vanity project that falls short of its promise.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>Ok kids, if a stranger in a vehicle pulls up next to you and offers you a ride to the North Pole...DO NOT GET ON!<br /><br />That was my first problem with this movie. All of the kids who got on the train used poor judgment. But it's only a movie right? Ok. I thought a lot of the movie looked more creepy than cheerful. The North Pole is an industrial wasteland. The elves are pretty creepy and Santa seems more mean than jolly.<br /><br />The visuals are pretty but the animators ran into trouble with the eyes and mouths of the characters. The eyes looked dead and the mouths were stiff.<br /><br />And did anybody else find the Jewish elf amusing? It seemed kind of out of place in a Christmas movie. But notably, this movie had nothing at all to do with Christ.</p></br><a href="../users/AMP7TQRWAIE84.html">AMP7TQRWAIE84</a><br/><p>Enchanting. Innocent. Adorable. Instills Hope. Charming. Lovely.

When it got to the big screen,much was lost in translation. Instead,it's a triumphalistic ode to commercialism,and is depressing at several points. Despite its amazing animation,it's a soulless Christmas film.<br /><br />In the beginning,the Hero gets welcomed onto the magical train. Later on,the Lonely Boy from the poor side of town comes onto the train-but he gets shoved into the back&is ignored by everyone except by the Hero Girl,who's really the heart of the story. There's a pointless musical number about hot chocolate. The Hero questions his belief in Santa Claus,and a spectral hobo tries to "help" him. After some exciting scenes with the train running over ice and dodging elk herds,the children arrive in the gloomy North Pole,where scratchy records play classic Christmas songs in empty factories. The North Pole scenes are incredibly eerie,evoking the Twilight Zone's famous "Where is everyone?" episode. In the end,there is the Triumph of the Santa rally,complete with entertainment from an ugly Steve Tyler lookalike elf. Aerosmith is for the Armageddon movie,NOT a Christmas movie.Ugh. Josh Groban has a beautiful song called "Believe";quite a contrast to the movie. The Hero gets his present,while the Hero Girl,who has shown courage and compassion,is treated dismissively by Santa himself. No good deed goes unpunished.<br /><br />"Polar Express" ends up being a creepy Tom Hanks vanity project. If you want to be in the Christmas spirit,skip this movie. Avoid it.</p></br><a href="../users/A9L6L5H9BPEBO.html">A9L6L5H9BPEBO</a><br/><p>The Polar Express taps into our affirmation that Christmas is believing, that believing is good, that being good will always be rewarded, and that we must keep faith with our beliefs and our dreams or they will disappear into the lost innocence of adulthood.<br /><br />Hungering for a classic of some kind that would remind me of the larger-than-life Christmas stories of my childhood, I started to watch this even though I had passed it by with channel surfing warp speed dozens of times before. It wasn't long before I realized I might be watching a classic I had been yearning for.<br /><br />It is Christmas Eve and a little boy is fighting sleep with a rising skepticism in the belief of Santa Claus. A check of his atlas by flashlight confirms that the North Pole is an uninhabitable and barren place, just before he jumps back into bed one blanket ahead of his parents opening his door.  He hears his father whisper to his mother about the end of the magic, which he thinks has something to do with the belief in Santa. Later, and still awake, the sound of a train's whistle and its cars with yellow light blazing from passenger car windows, appear on the snow in front of his house. In robe, pajamas and slippers, he heads out to explore when a conductor asks if he's going to get on board. His adventure to the North Pole, on the Polar Express begins.<br /><br />He meets a sweet-looking wholesome, black girl who is as trusting as he is doubtful, a nerd who hides his doubts behind glasses and know-it-all obnoxiousness, a later, younger arrival who only seems to trust his own solitude, and a hobo who sounds cynical and kindly at the same time.<br /><br />The animation was so good that the children almost seemed real. Tom Hanks lent his voice to at least three characters I could identify, and the music, especially the song "Believe" was absolutely enchanting. The story is how each of us react to our doubts and fears that some things are true or that some are not, that the strongest things to believe in are the things we cannot see or hear. In the end, we find out if our hero, the skeptic can still hear the bells when they could no longer be heard by others.<br /><br />Here's hoping you can hear the bells in your Christmas--and still believe.</p></br></body></html>

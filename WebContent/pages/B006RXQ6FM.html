Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Father Brendan Flynn, the parish priest. Joseph Foster II plays Donald Miller, the first black student in the school and an altar boy. Amy Adams plays his history teacher, Sister James.<br /><br />Ah, you're getting the picture already, aren't you?<br /><br />Sister Aloysius is suspicious of Father Flynn, although she does not specify why. It's not just the sermon he gives on the topic of Doubt, but as she puts it, "I know people." Indeed she does, but we may be left with a question as to whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. Father Flynn is only slightly indiscreet, and can cover his behavior with lies. But one lie (I'm trying not to give away too much) leaves the boy taking punishment for something that was really Father Flynn's doing.<br /><br />Sister Aloysius asks Donald's parents to come and talk with her, but only his mother shows up. She reveals some important facts about what's going on, as well as her attitude toward the situation and her husband's. The audience has no choice but to conclude that this boy is in a total trap. There is nothing, literally nothing, he can do to improve his situation.<br /><br />The same cannot be said of Sister Aloysius. And I will leave it there so as to avoid ruining the conclusion. In the very end, she is sitting in the courtyard which is covered with snow when Sister James finds her, and talks over with her exactly what happened. Her last line is "I have such doubts. Such doubts."<br /><br />It's a moving story, but it's hard to know with whom to sympathize, who to blame. It's just a very tragic story. However, I did decide who to blame: the bishop.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>I didn't know quite what to expect from this little film called Doubt. I thought this film would be slow, boring, and preachy but to my surprise, this is one movie I plan on viewing again and again. Meryl Streep, Amy Adams, and Philip Seymour Hoffman all give powerful and seething performances. Doubt has serious subject matter but there are some quirky moments as well. So glad I watched this film, I highly recommend it!</p></br><a href="../users/A36RS7KTNOBROF.html">A36RS7KTNOBROF</a><br/><p>"Doubt" is one of thoes films you only need to see once.I have to give it 5 stars for the great acting,but its alittle borning,but you keep watching to find the truth,but you never do.<br />I did laugh alot at Meryl Steep.She is always great,but she hit this charater perfect.We had mean nuns just like this one in school.<br />A week before I saw "Doubt" our priest gave the same sermon Philip Seymour Hoffman gave about the pillow feathers.I thought this movie wouldn't be a film the Catholic Church would approve,but after watching It,I can understand why they want everyone to see the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>Few films achieve such toothy tension, let alone sustain it throughout.  Built on a fantastic cast, flawless direction, and sharp writing, Doubt casts nothing but on every character from the first scene to the last.  Excellent philosophical questions are raised, particularly when a student's mother brings a very unorthodox view to the fore.  Not a family film, but certainly a thought-provoking discussion piece on religious curiosities and good film making.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>A return to respectability for Meryl Streep. (I didn't care for her musical)  This is a slow, character driven piece that I was totally head faked into believing that Streep was the unreasonable one.  I agree with one reviewer that there are no real good characters here--except perhaps for the little boy.  But then again, we see nothing through his eyes.  I like Amy Adams but she felt more like wallpaper in this piece.  To me, Hoffman didn't bring his A game--but Meryl is the master of the game.  It's a good solid movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>[Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.]<br /><br />The doubt is on two levels.  One, there is the doubt that Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) molested the boy.  The deeper doubt is that if he did, did he do anything wrong?  Or on an even deeper level, did the wrong that he did outweigh the good that he did?  This last question is at the very heart of the relationship between priests and boys in the near contemporary American society depicted in this film.<br /><br />Personally I don't believe that the ephemeral culture in which we live can answer that question.  Perhaps it is true that people like Father Flynn are compelled to do good in this world for just those boys who most need them because of their "nature" (as Meryl Streep's character Sister Aloysius puts it).  Science has a lot of trouble accounting for homosexuality, and understandably most scientists aren't interested in exploring why some men are sexually attracted to boys.  The truth from an evolutionary point of view must be that in some sense that attraction leads to, paradoxically, a better fit for not only the boy, which is obvious in some circumstances, but also for the man.  How can this be?  Most theories about homosexuality invoke male bonding as the evolutionary force that makes the behavior adaptive.  Homosexual males bond with other males (homosexual or not) and thereby increase their access to females.  So great is the advantage that accrues to such males that even the homosexual males (who mate only to have offspring) have an adaptive advantage over outsider males.<br /><br />But what is the adaptive advantage to males who are sexually attracted only to boys?<br /><br />In a way this film (and the direction by John Patrick Shanley based on his play) actually addresses this question.  The answer comes from the scene in which Sister Aloysius and the boy's mother (Viola Davis as Mrs. Miller) talk and walk.  The mother clearly sees that whether her boy is getting molested by the priest or not is secondary to the fact that the priest cares about him more than his father.  In other words (and most specifically in other circumstances) the priest would become the ally of the mother and they would bond.  In a world far removed from ours, in the prehistory, they might become as one.  Or in a world removed from the celibacy of the priesthood he would love the boy and the mother and she would love him and sex would happen, although perhaps not as frequently as it would if the man were heterosexual.  Certainly he is a better man for the boy and for any further boys than a father who would beat his son.<br /><br />Meryl Streep who has given us so many brilliant performances gives yet another one here.  And Hoffman ditto.  I have said it before and I'll repeat it, Meryl Streep is nearly flawless in everything she does.  Philip Seymour Hoffman ditto.  To see two of the greatest actors of our time in the same film is quite a treat.  To give them such indelible characters to work with and such a compelling story to act out is really wonderful.  And I must say that Amy Adams who played Sister James was also excellent and was not noticeably overshadowed by Streep and Hoffman.  Viola Davis who played the one scene as the boy's mother was also excellent.<br /><br />The movie starts slowly as in a play, which it is. This is allowable since the play-going audience has an investment and won't get up even if the first act goes slowly.  After a few minutes the story picks up and gathers power until, with a not entirely discernable suddenness, we are enthralled.  In the end we realize how quickly the story was actually told.<br /><br />Do not give up on this after the first ten or fifteen minutes.  It is a story about an issue for our times not to be missed, told with dignity and compassion for all concerned, and with a deep appreciation for the subtleties and paradoxes of human nature and the complexities of our world.</p></br><a href="../users/ADJBUPS8SJHTC.html">ADJBUPS8SJHTC</a><br/><p>Oh this was one good movie; One wallop of a movie; I came fully prepared to hate Hoffman's character. But along the way, especially when he was talking to Sis James' character, I couldn't help but notice the fact that he had a soft gentle side; I may be wrong but as an African American woman, I just saw a sensitive kind hearted priest that tried to befriend a boy in his parish who happens to be black and caught his own hell in the movie. In the end, when Streep brought out her hand to Sister James, I was like she brought a trump card and fully expected to play it. When he told her he knew people, and she simply said, "You will lose" I was blown away by that. This is a nun in the Catholic church telling a priest that in spite of his statue and job, she will fight him if necessary. It was then that I felt that somehow this man was being falsely accused; I saw the emotions on the man's face and to me, I saw no guilt only pain. For a while I saw it, but to be honest, we will never know if she was right in her accusations. I can also see why Viola Davis' role was considered for an Oscar as well. You want to say, Lady wheres your head? but on the other hand, considering the fact that hes already catching his own hell at home, you have to say is this worth it? is it?</p></br><a href="../users/A1DRKVXO300RUE.html">A1DRKVXO300RUE</a><br/><p>So for anyone who had that special of an experience in catholic gradeschool that they now consider themselves anything but catholic, watch this movie prepared.  The nuns are square on - cold, heartless and terrifying (save for one good hearted one).  Ah, but without continuing this personal expose, this was a great film about some of the worst tendencies of human nature - gossip.  And the priest delivers a fantastic sermon on gossip with a great allegory.  My wife and I actually discussed this one for several days debating on whether he did it nor not.  That's the mark of a good story for me - giving you something to debate.  As much as I dislike Hoffman, he was great and played the role perfectly.  And Meryl Streep is, as always, fantastic, but with an accent that wavers a little in its believability.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>Did he or didn't he?<br /><br />When Father Flynn (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) takes an interest in the only Black boy in school, Donald Miller (Joseph Foster) the Principal Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) makes accusations of impropriety.<br /><br />The Father has an explanation. Donald, an altar boy, was caught drinking sacramental wine. The kid's troubled, his father beats him, and he needs help.  Sister Aloysius doesn't buy it--well, in truth, she doesn't seem capable of giving any kind of warm fuzzy support to her students or her staff.<br /><br />"Leave my son out of this.  My husband will kill my son over one thing like this..." his mother (Viola Davis) begs. She wants her son in Catholic School until June so he can get into a good high school and she's not questioning the motives of someone who's been kind to her son when so few others have been. You see, Mrs. Miller believes her son is 'different' and that's the nature God gave him.<br /><br />Sister James (Amy Adams), a new nun, doesn't believe Father Flynn did anything wrong. She can't sleep after the accusations.<br /><br />"Doubt" is a powerful drama about human nature and tolerance. Father Flynn is not the kind of Catholic Sister Aloysius is--his fingernails are too long, he drinks three sugars in his tea, he wants secular music in the Christmas pageant, and he's openly affectionate to the students...Does that make him inappropriate or wrong?  So--did Father Flynn take liberties with Donald or didn't he?  Watch the film.  Decide for yourself. Perhaps you will have doubts....<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, April 2009</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Meryl Streep portrays an inflexible nun, dedicated to the job of keeping things the way they've always been, and staying fully in charge of the school and convent which she leads.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is a priest with great compassion for his parishioners, and especially for a young altar boy whose father beats him on a regular basis.  Streep's character chooses this very compassion to challenge the priest and, using an incident reported by another nun, she works to discredit him and banish him from the parish.  Streep and Hoffman are wonderful actors and without their performances this would have been a much less powerful movie.  My husband and I had diametrically opposed views of what the truth was in the gray areas of the film, which says to me that it was a wonderful springboard for discussion.  I did feel that it was a little slow at times and that there should have been more proof for Streep's character to act as she did.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>Meryl Streep gives another incredible performance in "Doubt".  Her character is similar to the character she played in "The Devil Wears Prada" given they are both total beotches.  There was alot of symbolism in this film with the lights going on and off and the constant interuptions that took place whenever they were discussing something serious.  I can't figure out what they meant but I know they meant something. Technically,  I loved the way Doubt was filmed and I liked the colours they used, the cinematography was excellent. I also enjoyed the costumes.  Story wise, there were alot of unanswered questions throughout the film but I guess it was intentional considering the subject matter of the film, "doubt".  I didn't really like the ending of the film, I wanted to find out if Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character really did have inappropriate relations with Donald.  He sort of skirted around the issue and never really admitted to anything but i guess this was also intentional for the sake of suspense and mystery.  I thought the film should have been longer and a bit more detail oriented with some of the characters.  The very last scene when Sister Alyosious says she has "doubts", I didn't fully understand what she meant.  Does she have doubts about the father, does she have doubts about her faith and God?  I guess I'm the type of person who wants some things spelled out for me.</p></br><a href="../users/ASEBX8TBYWQWA.html">ASEBX8TBYWQWA</a><br/><p>Having seen the play on tour with the original Broadway lead actor, Cherry Jones, I was anxiously awaiting this release. In a somewhat different way, Meryl Streep is exceptional in the film's lead role. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is equally brilliant in his role. But the film lacks some of the tension of the stage production, whose cast consisted of just four actors. Playwright John Patrick Shanley "opened" of the story with his film adaptation. He added many more characters - quite a few are superfluous - and brought it outside the Catholic School. More importantly, he added extra events that seem contrived. When Sister Beauvier (Streep) does something wrong there is a clap of thunder - or the lights go out. When Shanley wants to build suspense he brings in a strong wind. He wants the viewer to know that God is "not pleased" or "Something terrible is about to happen". These moments are so obvious that you are distracted by the IDEAS that Shanley has  put into the words that his characters speak.<br /><br />But let me not dissuade you from seeing this DVD. The acting is SUPERB from all the main characters. The films FIVE Oscar nominations certainly support this. Shanley was nominated - but for the screenplay (well deserved); not as a Director.<br /><br />The bonus features are interesting but often spend a lot of time showing scenes from the film, which you have already seen. This is becoming common practice and a 10 minute "featurette" will often only have six minutes of new material. I have not taken the time to listen to Shanley's complete commentary track.<br /><br />Highly recommended, specifically for the acting, but also for the script if you have not previously seen the stage version.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />"Anything Phonographic"</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>Oh, this film is a gem. The cinematography, the acting, the characters, the director, the place, the time and those words not said. The gem of them all is Meryl Streep as Sister Aloysius, "Ms. Streep blows in like a storm, shaking up the story's reverential solemnity with gusts of energy and comedy. The performance may make no sense in the context of the rest of the film, but it is -- forgive me, Father -- gratifying nunsense"<br />Manohla Dargis<br /><br />Doubt as we all know, and as Father Flynn played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, reminds us in a sermon is ambiguity, that land between black and white. Sister Aloysius is a nun from the old school, stern and severe, no nonsense, and underneath, rarely does the real person shows through. She is the Principal of the school, St Nicholas, and everything is done and run by her. Sister James, Amy Adams, once remarks that the school is like a jail- the students are afraid and intimidated by Sister Aloysius. "That's as it should be," answers, Sister Aloysius. She gives great latitude to Sister  James, could it be she sees in her a younger, truer image of herself? We find out as time goes on that Sister Aloysius was once married, but her husband was killed during the war. Meryl Streep is delicious in this role, her accent so true to the times and the Bronx.<br /><br />Sister James is an innocent. She believes life is good and fair and just and it is up to Sister Aloysius to teach her the ropes. But, Sister James comes through in flying colors, and she is the embodiment of every teacher we have ever loved.<br /><br />Father Flynn, he of such great depth and charm and warmth. All he wants to do is to bring some reform to the school. To lighten up the dark, bring some modern fun and times to the school. And, then he is accused.<br /><br />Donald, the only black child in the school. He is not scorned by his classmates, but left to go on his own. He is befriended by Father Flynn. A boy needs a role model.<br /><br />Donald's mother, Mrs Mullen, played by Viola Davis, is a loving mother, and she only wants the best for her child. Donald only needs until June when he graduates and can get into a good college and be on his way. Donald's mother and Sister Aloysius have one of the pivotal moments in this film, and Viola Davis is superb. She blows the scene away with her acting.<br /><br />John Patrick  Shaley, the writer and director portrays the school of his youth in real terms. He returns to his neighborhood, uses some of his old child hood friends as extras and brings the Catholic childhood of his youth to life. He first wrote the play and it appeared on Broadway to rave reviews.<br /><br />There are few things in this film that are for certain. One of them may be the absolute powerlessness of women in the Church. The men are protected and the women wait on them.  Oh, really? We all have doubts, we are sure at times we know who is right and who is wrong, and then the film twists this all around and up and down.  This film has one of the few times when all of us, in unison, gasp at what we have just seen. There is no doubt that this film is extraordinary. It is a film that kept me spellbound.<br /><br />Highly, Highly Recommended.  prisrob 04-11-08<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000068MBW">"...First Do No Harm"</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018M6J90">Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day (Widescreen & Full Screen Edition)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BXMZ8">Owning Mahowny</a></p></br><a href="../users/A1POFVVXUZR3IQ.html">A1POFVVXUZR3IQ</a><br/><p>"Doubt" is a highly atmospheric and visually compelling dialogue-driven drama and showcases some of the best performances in a movie. The multi-talented Meryl Streep plays the fearsome Sister Aloysius, Principal of St Nicholas Catholic School, and takes up arms against the kind-hearted and genial Father Flynn [Philip Seymour Hoffman, who astounds with another compelling and credible performance]. Sister Aloysius personifies every stereotype of a Catholic nun one hears about - she is stern, constantly disapproving, and quick to point out the deficiencies in others.She is extremely disapproving of Father Flynn - he uses a ballpoint pen [God forbid!], he takes three lumps of sugar with his tea [ a sign of gluttony], he likes Frosty the Snowman [a pagan character!] and above all, he is too easy-going and tolerant. When young, impressionable, and rather naive Sister James [Amy Adams] finds Father Flynn displaying too much interest in a new kid at school,Donald, who also happens to be the first black kid admitted to a school whose students are primarily Irish or Italian, Sister Aloysius pounces at the opportunity to oust Father Flynn and expose him to be the degenerate she believes him to be. The evidence is purely circumstantial, yet Sister Aloysius is relentless in her efforts to expose Father Flynn, compelling the reluctant Sister James to spy on him.<br /><br />The performances here are top-rate - Philip Seymour Hoffman is credible as the embattled priest with aspersions of doubt cast upon his character. Meryl Streep portrays her role as the almost maniacal Sister Aloysius with assurance and perhaps even glee, and Amy Adams comes into her own as an actress with a finely-nuanced performance as the young nun in a difficult situation. There is also Viola Davis who plays Donald's mother with conviction.<br /><br />The dialogue effectively captures the themes portrayed in this human drama with substance. The dreary atmosphere at the school is effectively captured with the use of muted colors and the score lends a haunting effect to the proceedings.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because of the stereotypical roles assigned to Meryl Streep's character as the vindictive nun with an agenda and Amy Adams' overly naive nun. Also Viola Davis' reaction to the situation seemed rather shocking to me as a parent myself.<br /><br />But, flaws aside, "Doubt" certainly is a well-made drama that provides food for thought.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>Doubt deserved more awards and nominations that it received.  I was sitting on the edge of my seat the entire way through. This taut drama couldn't have been edited any better--there's nothing much to cut here! The plot moves along at a very good pace and the acting is very convincing; the brilliant cast turns in tremendous performances that would make most "celebrities" green with envy. The cinematography worked well, especially in the scenes in Sister Aloysius' office; and the choreography shines all the way through the film.<br /><br />When the action starts, we quickly meet Donald Miller (Joseph Foster II), the first and only African-American student in The Saint Nicholas Catholic School in late 1964. Donald doesn't fit in; the rest of the students are from Italian and Irish families and he does get harassed by a fellow student soon after he enters the school. Father Brendan Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) takes a liking to the young boy and professes that he wants to help Donald because Donald comes from a troubled home. Father Flynn thinks Donald needs extra attention to be sure Donald succeeds in his new school. Trouble is, however, that one day Sister James (Amy Adams) witnesses some odd behavior: Father Flynn returns Donald's undershirt to his locker instead of just giving it directly to Donald; and after a private talk with Father Flynn Donald returns to class--with alcohol on his breath.<br /><br />Sister Aloysius already dislikes Father Flynn intensely; his progressive attitudes represent all that is changing in the outside world while Sister Aloysius is desperate to preserve the old ways of life. Sister Aloysius also dislikes that Flynn takes sugar in his tea, wears his fingernails a bit long--and now he wants a secular song added to the school's annual Christmas show. But once Sister Aloysius finds out that Donald may have been approached by Father Flynn in an inappropriate way, she just might have all that she needs to drive him out.<br /><br />And what a power struggle it becomes. Sister Aloysius gets nothing but denial from Father Flynn; he adds that Mr. McGuinn (Jack O'Connell) caught Donald drinking alter wine and that Father Flynn privately forgave him so that Donald could remain an alter boy. Does McGuinn back this up? And when Sister Aloysius tries to talk to Donald's mother (Viola Davis) about the potential problem, she gets quite a different reaction than she expected. What an explosive scene!<br /><br />I can't say enough about these incredible, unforgettable performances. These actors really and truly become the characters that they play in this film; everything is THAT convincing. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Meryl Streep, Amy Adams and Viola Davis worked magic to make these characters come to life. The final confrontation between Sister Aloysius and Father Flynn couldn't have been performed any better. In addition, the theme of light is very noticeable; Sister Aloysius opens the shutters to put Father Flynn in a police-like interrogation spotlight when she initially questions him with Sister James at her side; and it's interesting to note that Sister James, who comes to believe that Father Flynn is innocent, "causes" a light bulb to go out during a conversation she has with Sister Aloysius. The wind also is used to highlight the tensions between all these people.<br /><br />The DVD comes with a number of very good extras. We get a featurette on the Sisters Of Charity; and there's a commentary with writer/director John Patrick Stanley. I also liked the bonus feature entitled Doubt: From Stage To Screen. There is more, too.<br /><br />Doubt is not a family movie; it's a dark, pensive film that packs a punch. It also makes a strong statement about the difficulty of interpreting behavior that is ambiguous to say the least. I highly recommend this film for people who like dramas that are chock full of tension and suspense.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Every morning most of us wake up and flip the coin. On one side of the coin is faith and the other doubt. While this movie deals with the suspicions of an uptight nun (Meryl Streep), a young acolayte (Amy Adams)about whether the beloved Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman)abused a young boy, it's really about doubt and faith (hence the title)as well as what motivates us to embrace one or the other.Father Flynn has taken a young African American boy under his wing--the first in a white school consisting of people of Irish and Italian descent. He clearly identifies with the boy. Different people will come away with different impressions (this isn't really a mystery focusing on whether or not he did it as much as what and why we choose to believe)after watching this and it does reward with mulitple viewings.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks absolutely stunning. I also saw a preview of the DVD and it looks quite good as well. Both have the same special features including a commentary track with John Patrick Shanley. He's engaging, entertaining and informative unlike some solo commentary tracks. We also get a very good making of featurette, one that focuses on the "Sisters of Charity" order that the nuns belong to in the film. We also hear from various nuns as to their impression of the play and film (particularly from the woman that inspired Sister James played by Adams who was one of Shanley's teachers). The only thing missing is a joint commentary track from the cast although Hoffman, Adams and Streep do appear in a segment answering questions about the film, their roles. They all give thoughtful, entertaining and intelligent answers.<br /><br />John Patrick Shanley has done a terrific job adapting his play to the screen making it more cinematic in often subtle (and not so subtle)ways. The performances are brilliant--all three main actors were deservedly nominated for Oscars as was the film itself. Shanley expertly mines his experience raised in the Roman Catholic faith and being taunt at a Catholic school in Boston. Set in 1964 "Doubt" symbolizes the winds of change that were shaking the nation, politics and the Catholic Church with Vatican II. This film isn't really about the Catholic Church nor is it about the alleged abuse itself and how it is dealt with but it's really about the conflict between doubt, faith, old and the new way of doing things in a institution struggling to remain relevant during the turbulent 1960's.<br /><br />In the end all you can do is wake up in the morning, flip the coin and hope for the best but you won't be flipping a coin when it comes to the quality of this terrific drama. There's no risk involved. Highly recommended</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>I had already seen this as a play before the film came out and the most obvious difference between them is Meryl Streep's intepretation of Sister Aloysis versus Linda Hunt or Cherry Jones' take on her on stage.  Streep seems to be more histronic and theatrical versus the restraint of the two actress--almost like she'a witch in a halloween suit!!  Nevertheless, I still found the film worthwhile despite this difference. The final confrontation between Hoffman and Streep is probably screen acting at his best!! And Viola Davis makes her brief appearance count--no wonder she was nominated!! Shanley has succeeded in raising "doubt" in this fine film.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>There is much ado about nothing when it comes to "Doubt". Certainly it has a potent albeit badly delivered message; it has stellar performances that nonetheless come too close to caricature. It is always unwise to attempt to insert levity where levity is not welcome.<br /><br />Meryl Streep's turn as Sister-Mother-Superior-Wannabe Aloysius (correct spelling is Aloisius by the bye) is simultaneously shocking, powerful and silly. Philip Seymour Hoffman as the beleaguered Father Flynn is a character study worthy of Spencer Tracy. He has his dark side and dark moments, which still look fairly innocuous to me. I recall that Golden Rule of innocent until proven guilty.<br /><br />What are we, the audience, supposed to doubt? Streep's sanity? Hoffman's sincerity? Didn't the sweet, angelic Sr. James (Amy Adams) steal the show completely? Did Father Flynn abuse young Donald Miller (played beautifully by Joseph Foster II and miscredited at the end as "Daniel Miller")? Was he merely protecting young Donald? Did he identify with young Donald's emerging gayness (something Donald's mother clearly discloses to Streep)?<br /><br />Will the question marks ever end??<br /><br />In a way, this film is sheer insanity-in-the-making. A wicked witch of a nun, overburdened as a school's principal, automatically hates and suspects the young priest working at the school. She's out to get him, because she can smell a rat at a hundred paces.<br /><br />Yet there really is something 'funny' about the priest. His nails are too long. He resents the Church and its Medievalism. He dislikes the principal for her very crumbly old fashioned ways. When confronted, he seems so innocent and purely motivated. That is, until his facade begins to crack in an ugly way, and we think we see a guilty, evasive criminal.<br /><br />Is he a child molester after all? Umm, I do not know to this day. And I've scrutinized the film over a dozen times. All I can tell you is I do not believe Fr. Flynn guilty as charged ... and perhaps that was the main message. I'll never really know.<br /><br />We know very well that the era of pedophile priests had begun to emerge into the public eye at this time, the late 1960s. So, did the priest victimize a ready-made victim, the only black child in the school? Or did he love this child a bit more than he loved the others? Was he merely protecting young Donald?<br /><br />Here's what we do know: nasty looks shot at Fr. Flynn by certain students (BIG clue, thanks a lot). In fact, the little bastard who smiles at the news that Fr. Flynn is leaving gives us nothing - precisely because he's a little bastard. We know the old nun is checking out the priest, investigating his past. We know she's willing to manually explode her rosary into tiny pieces in her crusade to "get" Fr. Flynn.<br /><br />Like a bad, very bad mystery, this film reveals nothing at the end. Nothing but Sr. Aloysius' "doubts" - and I still ask myself, "What?? What does she doubt?", because we are never told what it is she doubts. My wife thought she was doubting her own faith. I thought she was doubting whether she did the right thing, except that she was glad and showed no remorse. Maybe she's doubting that this movie is going to be as good as she assumed ... which I seriously doubt.<br /><br />I took away TWO stars from this alleged 5-star film, one for the bad story-telling and one for the stupidly missed chances to make solid statements about pedophilia, racism and Medieval Church practices. It would have made a fine, tense drama bordering on a thriller, say, in the hands of Hitchcock - who reportedly was scared to death of Catholic nuns.<br /><br />Truly, I can hear Hitchcock's unmelodious voice saying, "One doubts this film is any good at all, but who can say for certain?"<br /><br />Also I say this: now is not the time to begin sowing doubt of any kind about the evil of pedophelia. It is rampant in the Catholic Church and it is all out of control. Is this a time to begin making people doubt?<br /><br />The movie needed to have a solid story, not spoonfeeding anyone with it, only knowing what it wanted to say. It communicated 'doubt' itself brilliantly, but again, it is the wrong message at the wrong time. In the midst of all this pain, denial, the Church running for cover, priests retaining lawyers - BAD time to start doubting!<br /><br />There is one undercurrent that occurred to me that is not mentioned: the very real damage the Church has inflicted on its clergy. Are both Sr. Aloysius and Fr. Flynn victims themselves? God knows what created a beast like Sr. Aloysius, but the Sisters Aloysius of the world may have created the Fathers Flynn.<br /><br />Even this, deep as it may appear, does not solve the mystery of Fr. Flynn, but it starts to infect Sr. James in a horrible way, a way that teaches how easily these awful contaminates can spread through holy institutions. Of that there is NO doubt.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>The story opens in 1964 in a neighborhood parish in the Bronx, where Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) is the school principal.  She's tough and traditional and bristles at the friendlier, more outgoing attitude of the pastor, Father Flynn (Phillip Seymour Hoffman).  A young teacher tells her that the priest may have acted inappropriately with one of her students, and Sister makes it her business to rid the parish of the dangerous man.<br /><br />This movie didn't live up to its hype for me.  I found the script dull and the actors competent, but not memorable.  The plot also draws upon the priest scandals of recent years and assumes guilt even though there is no evidence or trial.  There is no action at all and the overblown,  trite speeches lack real conviction.  I never believed Streep as the principal despite her scowls and knitted brows (and her accent that comes and goes); it all felt like play-acting.  Amy Adams is  way too saccharine and childlike as the young teacher.  I did like Hoffman as Father Flynn, however, and thought he did a good job of keeping us guessing.<br /><br />All in all, it seemed too stagy and tedious and ultimately pointless.  There were many things the Sister could and should have done with her suspicions but she did nothing except believe she was right.  It all  felt very unsatisfying to me.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>In a 1964 Catholic school, a priest has been accused--by the school's principle--of molesting the only black student.  This is the main plot of DOUBT, though as with any film of this nature, there's much more to it: tolerance, sexism, and yes, doubt in many of its forms.  This creates a slow-moving film that may not be for all viewers; it is a film made to make you think--especially the final confrontation between Streep and Hoffman, and viewers with little patience will come away somewhat disappointed.  That cannot be helped.<br /><br />There is a reason why four of DOUBT's principle actors were nominated for awards: This film is driven by its actors, namely Philip Seymour Hoffman, Meryl Streep, Amy Adams, and Viola Davis.  Hoffman is in strong form as always; Davis, in her too-brief role, is a marvel; Adams proves yet again she is a very reliable actress.  It is, however, Streep who steals the show, diving headlong into the character of a traditional nun who resents the presence of a reform-minded priest.  The actors help the film avoid the many pitfalls--too many dramatic camera angles, a couple of minor subplots that are distracting.  The theme is strong and well-carried out (this film was also nominated for its script, and rightly so), but it is up to the actors to make everything work.  And they do.  If nothing else, DOUBT is proof that there are genuinely talented actors still working in Hollywood, and filmmakers willing to challenge their viewers, even if it means low Box Office receipts and certain audience members getting offended (lets face it, it always happens).</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>In various 'professional' reviews of John Patrick Shanley's adaptation of his own hit play, I've read things like "Philip Seymour Hoffman goes toe to toe with Meryl Streep"..and "Amy Adams holds her own against Meryl Streep"..and "despite only being on the screen for 12 minutes, Viola Davis hangs with Meryl Streep."  Hmmmm [scratches chin]...what do these reactions all have in common?  Only that Meryl Streep is the measuring stick against whom all others are to be judged.  I guess it's passe to say directly that Meryl Streep is extraordinary.  Instead, everyone now puts her co-stars on some type of Streep-o-meter.  Needless to say, the best performance in a Meryl Streep movie is...Meryl Streep.  That's taken for granted some times.<br /><br />The movie itself is pure dynamite.  As someone who was raised as a Catholic in the 60s and attended a Catholic high school in the 70s, this movie resonated deeply with me.  One scene that stuck out: Shanley's juxtaposition of the prim, cloistered convent with its almost mute nuns, followed immediately by nothing less than the raucous cacophony of the rectory with its hard-drinking, garrulous priests.  This scene was pure genius and no doubt left many of my fellow Catholics of a certain age thrilled with such a realistic portrayal.  I raved to my wife after the film about absolute truth of that passage.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman nails his role here.  His character is believable as a mentor to the boys - the scene where he helps them shoot foul shots and answers some of their questions shows that mentoring side.  But Shanley's script is subtle and telling here, too, because we also get some of the character's quirkiness.  Hoffman shows the boys his clean nails and says "I like to keep them a little long."  Just enough to make you start thinking...</p></br><a href="../users/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA.html">A3NH7PYU4AD5GA</a><br/><p>While this year's Oscar batch may disappoint the box office, I find the level of the nominated movies quite outstanding. 'Doubt' is one of the excellent movies in the competition; it is a theater play put on the screen with the best cast that you could find for it. Streep and P.S.Hoffman and two more actresses are in the race for acting awards, and that is well deserved.<br /><br />Streep is a self-righteous Catholic school principal in New York, a nun; she runs her shop by fear and mistrust. It is 1964. Hoffman is the parish priest, and he lives by different rules. She dislikes him for his kindness and for his popularity. He takes sugar with his tea! He writes with a ball-point pen! He is nice to people! He smokes!<br /><br />She is out to catch him with something, anything, and instructs one of her underlings to watch specifically for odd behaviour. The young nun reports that she found one of her 12 y old students, the only black boy, an altar boy, visibly disturbed and smelling of alcohol, after a meeting with the priest.<br /><br />Streep's character picks on this piece of incomplete information and blows it out of proportion. She goes head on for the confrontation, and of course nobody can win against the kind of allegations and suspicions that can grow out of it. The two lead actors carry the confrontation. A mediocre cast would have run the movie aground.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>I wouldn't buy this movie but I probably will end up recording Meryl Streep's scenes because her portrayal of a Catholic School nun is PERFECT.

At the heart of the tale is a progressive-minded priest (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who is viewed as highly suspect by a tyrannical nun (Meryl Streep) who personifies all that was wrong with the strict nuns who thought that harsh discipline and humiliation was the way to rule the school classroom. The old vs. the new is what happens when these two clash.<br /><br />Very unlike what happened when Hollywood first tackled the subject of old vs. new in films like GOING MY WAY and THE BELLS OF ST. MARY'S where a young priest has to cope with the unchanging steel will of a crusty old parish priest.<br /><br />Here the subject matter is much more serious too, involving the suspicions of a nun eager to seize on any reason for ridding the parish of Father Flynn whom she accuses of an immoral act with a young altar boy in his charge, based on very flimsy evidence of another naive young Sister James (Amy Adams).<br /><br />The story becomes a character study of these three as they confront the issues raised by the domineering Sister Aloysius (Streep) who insists on a private meeting with Flynn in which the accusations fly fast and furious. This scene is super-charged with emotion and dramatically effective--but even more striking fireworks are yet to come when we meet the mother of the boy (Viola Davis) who is brilliant in her two big scenes with Streep during which another twist is given to the tale.<br /><br />To tell any more would be to spoil this for anyone not familiar with the material. Clearly, Shanley has written a very powerful drama and staged it with simplicity and truth in a way that is cinematic without losing any of its dramatic force as a play.<br /><br />For the performances alone, highly recommended as a thinking man's morality play that never quite gives you the feeling that you know all the answers to the riddle presented. It's open to many interpretations, but there's no doubt about one thing--this is a stark, emotional drama and Shanley makes the transfer to screen full of cinematic magic.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB.html">A3M6RVUVZOQZLB</a><br/><p>Let me say it up front: Change is inevitable. The four seasons show us that. But what change? To what end? What does doubt do to the equation? Can good come from doubt?<br /><br />"Doubt" depicts the troubling nature of doubt. In fact, the viewer is lead by the playwright's skillful dialog to question Sister Aloysious as a righteous destroyer. Are her doubts founded? In her best role to date as idealistic, but easily influenced Sister James, Amy Adams shows us the damaging nature of doubt and resulting gossip and outright allegations.<br /><br />You see, Donald Miller is the first African American student in St. Nicholas Catholic School in Boston in 1964. Father Flynn takes a special interest in Donald because he is isolated and intimidated. The doubt begins when Sister James relates an incident--rather, pieces of an incident--about Donald's being called alone to the rectory.<br /><br />Actually, the doubt begins with Sister-and-Principal Aloysious and her strict, stern, brook-no-nonsense way of running the school. One scene shows the deadly dull minimal talk at the dinner table among the nuns. The other shows the three priests in lively, hilarious conversation. Joy and community vs duty and stodginess. The contrast actually shows the viewer the extremes that can exist in a conflict and should warn as foreshadowing instead of truth.<br /><br />It's an unspoken accusation that is at the center of this drama. Is Father guilty or not? The film's tone would have us believe that Sister Aloysious is on a witch hunt because she dislikes the warm, caring, and popular priest. However, as a teacher in a Catholic school where diligence training concerning sexual abuse and harrasment is a monthly event, I understand Sister Aloysious's attention to this duty. What is more important: the care of a child or the protection of a priest? There's a very fine line here and one the playwright/director walks so carefully.<br /><br />Is the priest guilty? Does doubt destroy him? And Donald? As Shakespeare once showed: "All's well that ends well!" Or is it?</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Sister Aloysius is the dragon lady principal, the no-nonsense taskmaster, and the moral absolutist of the Catholic school in this film.  She terrifies the students and maintains strict order even at meals with the other sisters.  Then, through a series of misunderstandings, misperceptions, and suspicions, she starts to have doubts about the behavior of Father Flynn, who has befriended the only black child in the school and has tried to defend him from the other kids.<br />Without revealing the specifics, I'll just say that Sister A. goes on a mission to destroy Flynn's career and record because she believes fervently that her own suspicions are somehow proof of wrongdoing on his part.  Her manipulation of Sister James, whom she pressures, adds to the amount of damage she tries to inflict.<br />  By the end, you will see how important it is to give others the benefit of the doubt when you truly do not have all the facts or even any evidence at all.  By the time that lesson is learned, however, it might be too late for some of the parties involved.<br />  At first I wasn't sure if Hoffman was up to the task of playing a priest, but he was in fine tune.  Streep was fascinating and frightening to watch, while Amy Adams gave a nicely nuanced performance as Sister James.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Doubt" is an adaptation of the acclaimed theatrical play by John Patrick Stanley, set in a small Catholic school in 1964, as the nation and Church are poised for great social change. Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a friendly, easy-going man who teaches the boys basketball at the St. Nicholas School and gives the 8th graders light-hearted advice on their nascent social lives. The school's principal, Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep), is a humorless disciplinarian suspicious of Flynn's outgoing disposition and progressive ideas. Those suspicions infect a kindly young nun, Sister James (Amy Adams), who reports some unusual behavior of the school's first and only black student (Joseph Foster) after a private meeting with Father Flynn. That's enough to convince Sister Aloysius that Flynn is a child molester who must be driven out.<br /><br />John Patrick Stanley took inspiration from the Catholic school he attended as a child in the Bronx and a nun of the Sisters of Charity who was a favorite teacher. He adapted the play for the screen himself and also directs the film. I wondered if this might result in a movie that looks like a play on film, but I was pleasantly surprised by the its beauty. Roger Deacons' cinematography makes an impression immediately, while the opening credits are still rolling. He has created many striking shots, including some unexpected canted shots that don't seem unnatural or self-conscious. "Doubt" is still a film whose action takes place in conversations between its characters; it's not visually dynamic. But it is visually captivating -much  moreso than I expected from a film that is about the interactions between four people in one location.<br /><br />The secret of "Doubt"'s success may be that it is perceived differently by different people. I don't think there is agreement on what it's all about. At first the audience wonders if Father Flynn is guilty of misconduct. Eventually, we don't care, because so many other interesting questions have been raised. People are not what we expected and not what they expected of each other. There is a lot going on in the minds of these characters, and that's where the story lies. The idea of "doubt" is curious, because Sister Aloysius never has proof of anything; she only has her certainty. She banishes doubt, because she is incapable of acting without certainty. Many people wouldn't sweat the doubts so much in condemning their enemy.<br /><br />Is it acceptable to stray from the values that we claim to espouse in the pursuit of justice? Are we to condemn people for what they do or for what they are? "Doubt" raises a host of contemporary issues in a confined period drama. The most amazing thing it does is to introduce a third perspective, just when we're thinking that the battle is between Sister Aloysius' obsessive intolerance and Father Flynn's conspicuous kindness. The perspective is that of the boy's mother, Mrs. Miller (Viola Davis), who turns everything upside down in just one scene. I laughed out loud at Sister Aloysius' reaction: "This will not do." The actors pack so much into their performances. "Doubt" is a thought-provoking film and a bit of a chameleon.<br /><br />The DVD ( Miramax 2009): There are 4 featurettes and an audio commentary. "From Stage to Screen" (19 min) interviews John Patrick Stanley about his inspiration for the play and adapting it for the screen, as well as the actors and production designer David Gropman. "The Cast of Doubt" (14 min) is an interview of the principle cast by Dave Karger of Entertainment Weekly. In "Scoring Doubt" (4 1/2 min), composer Howard Shore and Shanley talk about the music. "Sisters of Charity" (6 1/2 min) interviews 4 nuns from the Sisters of Charity order, including the woman who inspired the Sister James character, about their lifestyle then and now.  The audio commentary by John Patrick Shanley talks a great deal about the time and place in which the story takes place. He also offers some information on visual decisions, sets, and filming.

It would be difficult to imagine a finer cast, here cast in roles counter to their usual types, bringing such power to the poetry of Shanley's lines.<br /><br />The story is well known by now (the dismissal of a progressive priest by a crotchety old Catholic school principal over a false rumor and all the 'doubt ' that brings into play in every character), but multiple viewings of this film intensify the humanity of each of the characters and demonstrate just how fine a writer Shanley is. The subject matter is difficult at first but the manner in which each of these superb actors (under the guidance of Shanley's direction) explore the effects of spite and loathing and forgiveness shares some of the finest ensemble acting in years. Recommended.  Grady Harp, April 09</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>The thing about Hoffman that always surprises me is his vast range of characters. He was great in "Before the devil knows you're dead" even though the film had an average storyline. Then in 2007 we had "The Savages" which I dare say is his best film. So when I heard praise about "Doubt", I knew that this was the film to watch out for. He is absolutely brilliant in his character and his dialogue delivery while narrating to a room full of adults and adolescents was wonderful. Meryl Streep kept him company and her stern, obstinate character was a treat to watch. The dialogues were good but it was the acting that made this film truly remarkable. This is the kind of self-proclaimed film critics like me love. You have to watch this. It goes right down to the wire and even after the film is over, you will feel like discussing it with that friend of yours who wants to be a book-writer someday. Excellent film overall. I only wish it was slightly longer but then that would have made it somehow flaky. Worth renting at the very least.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>The film based on John Patrick Shanley's play is superbly done. The actors are in top form with Meryl Streep and Seymour Hoffman demonstrating consider acting force as a nun and a priest in a struggle for competing versions of reality. It is basically about the quest for truth in a world of incomplete clues and hints. The search for truth may lead to a broad range of consequences depending on whose truth is accepted and whose truth is rejected. Sister Aloysius, the Catholic school principal, played by Meryl Streep, is convinced that she has discovered a truth about Father Brendan Flynn, a robust likable assertive priest, played by Seymour Hoffman.<br /><br />A great strength of the films script is that Shanley leaves the mystery somewhat unresolved in the screen play. Though some film viewers may have concluded that Father Flynn did have some improper behavior with a student, there is still much room for doubt since Father Muller could have been transferred to another Catholic parish to avoid Sister Aloysius' continued assault on his reputation and his peace of mind.<br /><br />The film begins with the central theme of the play, as given in a sermon by Father Flynn. He states: "What do you do when you are not sure?"  The play cascades from this point with Sister Aloysius convinced of Father Flynn's guilt and Sister James wracked with moral uncertainty as to what is true or not true and what are the moral consequences for each decision.<br /><br />Each clue in the film propels you toward one solution until you are given another clue drawing you in the opposite direction and conclusion. In this way, Sister James acts as the viewer and she voices some of the same trusts and doubts that must be in the mind of every viewer of the film. Some viewers of the film will not rush to judgment and will absorb the subtle clues that propel this clash of characters forward.  Other viewers of the film will take sides since Father Flynn is a likeable, robust, assertive, clever, strong, person who is contrasted with the cold rock strength and certainty of Sister Aloysius, who is never presented as especially warm or compassionate yet her actions speak to great compassion if indeed she fully believes she is interrupting the sexual predatory actions of Father Flynn.<br /><br />The film even takes a surprise direction when we hear from Donald Muller's mother who tells us her son is an effeminate child who was been repeatedly beaten in public schools as well as by his father for his effeminate behaviors. In Catholic school, his mother hoped he would be protected. His mother sees the possible attentions of this white priest toward her son as far more desirable than the hostility he experiences from young males in public school or from his own father. The character of Mrs. Muller is unexpected, wonderfully acted, and throws a complete different light onto the actions of the play. Sister Aloysius thought she had found a partner and then found more than for which she had bargained.<br /><br />The film comes to a resolution, one that I will not reveal and one that not every viewer will like or appreciate. But the human condition requires doubt, and certainty is so rare that we rightfully distrust it, doubt is far more likely to be the fate of human beings.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF.html">A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF</a><br/><p>No review, but a couple of doubts.<br />(1.) First, in the topically important subject of Father Flynn's conduct within his parish the audience should be presented with balanced arguments from both he and Sister Aloysius. Instead, we have a dominant/unbalanced presentation of the Sister's accusations over a weaker Father Flynn defense. That would be fine if the movie was entitled "Gossip". A more objective, albeit challenging movie would present the unfolding events as if to an omniscient audience and let us impartially decide guilt & innocence. In addition, the overindulgent & exaggerated acting only made it the more difficult to gleam the truth as to misconduct.<br />(2.) Second, the movie perpetuates the stereotype of misconduct within religious orders as being near rampant (shared blame with the media) even though the actual percentage of misconduct may be 0.01% and not statistically different than many other professions or categories of interest.</p></br><a href="../users/AG0TA24LI0XV7.html">AG0TA24LI0XV7</a><br/><p>See this movie only if you enjoy a film where the acting and writing is way above average, and only if you are in the mood for a film that will induce thought. This is not a movie to settle down with if you just want to be entertained for the evening. It's basically a quiet character study about conflicting people (although it does get fairly tense and emotional at times).<br /><br />I grew up in the 1970's and went to Catholic school; it was a decade after this film's time period but not much had changed, believe me. I was used to all the trappings of the church and of nuns and priests. I was not an altar boy but I was exposed to the traditions and experiences that are seen in this film. I would imagine that someone who is not familiar with these things at all might find some aspects of this movie to be almost foreign in certain ways. But a viewer need not be familiar with Catholicism (or even with the Bronx in 1964) to appreciate this movie.<br /><br />The four principles give outstanding performances, particularly Meryl Streep and Viola Davis (Davis has just one major scene, and she is excellent in it). Streep owns the movie as the conflicted and multifaceted Sister Aloysius; this is probably the most relentless and stubborn woman in cinema since Nurse Ratched in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" in 1975 (played by Oscar-winner Louise Fletcher). I was fascinated with this character, and torn over how I felt about her. She can be considered a heroine and also a villain at the same time. It's hard to explain. She can be strict, unfair, caring, funny, impatient, and cold. And it's no surprise that this would be another (her sixteenth) Oscar nomination for Meryl Streep. She never stops creating authentic characters. In "Doubt", her mannerisms, body language, accent, and expressions were all spot-on.<br /><br />The film is sometimes ambiguous, particularly the final scene. Some things are left to the audience to wrestle with and to interpret. I enjoyed that the story becomes much more than a mystery, that it becomes more about a person's choices and judgments and decisions. Kudos to playwright and director John Patrick Shanley for making this powerful film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>Doubt (2008)<br />Drama, 104 minutes<br />Directed by John Patrick Shanley<br />Starring Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams and Viola Davis<br /><br />Here's a film that I never expected to watch. The trailer looks boring and depressing and the subject matter isn't something that I would expect to hold my attention.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />The screenplay provides the foundation for a great film, and I don't use that word lightly, but what really elevates Doubt is the superb performances from the cast. Meryl Streep is utterly convincing as Sister Aloysius Beauvier. I can't imagine anyone else in the role. The students must have been terrified of her. My school had someone just like that. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a very convincing priest. When the two finally clash in a war of words, it's one of the most breathtaking confrontations I have ever seen. Amy Adams has never been better and I wish she would choose to do more serious roles. Viola Davis made a brief appearance, but I will never forget it.<br /><br />I'm tempted to say that Streep was robbed of another Oscar, but Kate Winslet was brilliant in The Reader. Hoffman was never going to eclipse Heath Ledger, but his performance shouldn't be forgotten.<br /><br />Doubt is all about the dialogue. It's also subtle. We are never told the complete truth and it's left up to us to decide whether Father Flynn (Hoffman) is guilty or innocent. This is writing at its best. The other thing that is perfectly depicted is the setting. I felt as if I had been transported back to the 1960s.<br /><br />This is the kind of film that makes you want to find out more about the actors. I found myself seeking out other work by the cast.

If you have, did you think Father Flynn was guilty or innocent?</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>Saw this one under duress, since it looked kind of dumb in the trailer, and also the play had such a good performance in it by Cherry Jones I couldn't imagine anyone else but playing Sister Aloysius.

It is awful in a way, but sticks in your mind even weeks after seeing it, so it must have something, right?<br /><br />It doesn't have subtlety, that's for sure.  The scenes of Meryl Streep battling the wind are more laugh inducing that the combined efforts of Jim Carrey and Steve Carell, and you can throw in the Marx Brothers too.  They must have suggested to Streep that she watch the silent classic THE WIND with Lillian Gish and then ordered her to out-Gish Gish, with some Marcel Marceau thrown in too.  I'm surprised she didn't pluck a flower and smell it, she is so hammy you have to love her.  That, and the lights going out, are movie devices you hardly ever see today, more's the pity.  In fact we don't have enough symbolism about Vatican II in general.  I lived through the whole era, and in fact had an inappropriate relationship with a priest, without any of the wind coming down and whipping our garments around our faces.  And it just gets worse and worse.  At least Streep and Hoffman look like they're having fun, as does Viola Davis, much more pragmatic about letting her son carry on with an older man than my mom ever was, God rest her soul.  Amy Adams on the other hand does more moral suffering than all the actresses in Cries and Whispers combined.  Why she ever took the part I don't know, but it's lousy and so is she.<br /><br />Don't hate me, DOUBT lovers.  I just call them like I see them.  And remember, that was my T-shirt the priest put in my locker, and I've got a right to give my opinion of what was basically the story of my life if I was black and teased.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>Some reviewers referred to Doubt as a film for big-lobed geniuses. Others called it garbage.<br /><br />  Doubt falls somewhere in the middle. This film is not garbage - its designed and was released to get Academy Awards; and like a machine well-designed for a purpose, it does its job. Doubt pushes all the right emotional buttons, has all the right actors and actresses and the story is heavy enough to get the Academy's attention. Plus it contrasts nicely with the Holocaust-related films that are usually a shoe-in at the Oscars.<br /><br />  Even though this film is Oscar bait, Doubt is not bad. I liked the performances in the film and it is not boring. Sure, there are no car crashes nor explosions, but Doubt can still be considered a decent rental, if not a sale purchase.<br /><br />  To the "garbage" reviewers: I recommend "The Man From Earth" - a "thinking person's" movie, but it is not Oscar-bait and it is very entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/AYZLXLVMJGTJV.html">AYZLXLVMJGTJV</a><br/><p>The film definately shows Meryl Streep's rich acting. The movie was thought provoking. Projection can be so perplexing. I love Amy Adams and her sweetness in all the roles she takes on. I know this will be short. I think what I liked the most about the film, was how the pastor reached out to the little boy who felt so alone and seemingly hurt. Whether their was an agenda in play the kindness did feel tangible in Philip's acting.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BLITJITO97N5.html">A2BLITJITO97N5</a><br/><p>A horribly wound-up nun hounds a priest out of her parish because she (wrongly) suspects that he may be a pedophile. I found this film very unsatisfying as a drama. For one thing, the movie gives absolutely no explanation for Meryl Streep's character's nastiness. We hear nothing about her background except that she was once married and that her husband died in the war. The movie never explains why she is so nasty.  This is a poorly written drama and I think I know the reason why there is such a gaping hole in the script. Hold on to your seats because a lot of people reading this will not like what I am about to say. I suspect that the writer didn't think that he had to take time to explain the nun's hatred because he believes that all homophobia is baseless and paranoid and that it is always without reason or explanation. In other words, no viewer has a right to demand an explanation for Meryl Streep's homophobia when homophobia, at least as far as the writer is concerned, can never have any explanation but visceral and irrational hatred. Well, I'm not buying that rationale for one second. This is supposed to be a drama. The characters are supposed to make sense. Their actions have to have some motivation. Their opinions have an internal logic to them. Characters don't suddenly arrive at strongly held viewpoints without reason or background. This isn't character development; it's one dimensional caricaturing. How could any man have ever proposed to such a nasty woman (he couldn't have. So, what happened to change her?). How could such a nasty woman ever have thought that she had a vocation to serve Jesus? And how could she have been accepted into the convent (after thorough examination by a strict and demanding order of nuns) and then be elected mother superior? Answer: she couldn't have always been so mean and venomous so WHAT HAPPENED? This is the failure of the movie. Those who hate nuns or who like their homophobes to be one dimensional bigots won't care about that failure. This movie will confirm their own deeply held prejudices - and free them from having to think and question or - to have doubts.</p></br><a href="../users/AW1493ZQTQ2ET.html">AW1493ZQTQ2ET</a><br/><p>Count me among the minority of reviewers who doubt that this movie has any real merit.  As they've noted, this movie only pretends to wrestle with uncertainty and doubt of a profound form.  Anyone who entertains no doubts with regard to the big questions has fallen under the spell of an ideology; if you need this movie to be awakened to doubt, you've probably been in the grip of such a spell.<br /><br />The main doubt portrayed by the movie is actually a superficial one resulting from witholding information which would provide closure and meaning to the rather simple plot.  The truncated ending (or rather lack of a real ending) is such a fatal flaw that any redeeming qualities this movie has (and there are many) are totally undermined, to the extent that my rating is pushed all the way down to the extreme of 1 star, which is a rarity for me (I tend to be generous with movie ratings).<br /><br />I have no doubt that the 100+ minutes I spent watching this movie were wasted.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SU3TXON36T0X.html">A3SU3TXON36T0X</a><br/><p>Doubt (2008) tries to pass itself off as being about a morally ambiguous situation in which a conflict arises between an old nun and a young priest and there is simply insufficient information to determine who is the real wrongdoer.  However, what this film is really about is such questions as those of faith and certainty and doubt - the kinds of questions that plague philosophers.<br /><br />For a movie about a moral problem with insufficient information the movie fails for failing to take a clear unequivocal stance in comdemning a clear wrong - either the clear wrong of a man preying on young children or the clear wrong of gossiping about those you know and damaging their reputations.  There is no "doubt" about this matter.  Both are clear wrongs and it must be one or the other.<br /><br />As a philosophical movie that calls into question the nature of faith, the movie also fails in providing no termination point to the endless succession of generating doubts other than the apparent fact that absolute skepticism is self-refuting.  As such, the movie ends up wallowing in doubt which ultimately will lead to despair.  The movie does nothing to rectify this situation, offers no way out of this dreaded impasse, and leaves us in the midst of the mental meltdown of the old nun afflicted with this disease.  For failing to offer us hope and a foundation upon which one can build one's faith, this movie fails as well choosing instead to leave us dangling right over the abyss.<br /><br />The movie also tries to address Catholic issues, showing the apparent conflict between the old-pre-Vatican II church and the changes made post-Vatican II.  The movie considers the "old church" to be one based on discipline and ethically rooted in the notion of virtue, which the modernist priest seeks to replace with "kindness".  The well-meaning and idealistic young nun is certainly a likeable character in her innocence; however, it causes her to become so na?ve that she cannot even recognize that members of her own class are not listening or misbehaving until the old nun tips her off.  (Also, she thinks that FDR, Lincoln, and JFK were the three greatest presidents and states this pronouncement ex-cathedra coming straight from the chair of the self-appointed historical experts we all apparently know and look up to.)  Fortunately, the young nun learns that in order to control her class she must enforce some form of discipline, although she is not a harsh disciplinarian and apologizes once for being too harsh.  The old nun supposedly represents the pre-Vatican II church and places a portrait of Pope Pius XII above the board.  What is odd in this movie is how much power this woman has over a priest.  Further, she does not go to the proper channels, legal and hierarchical, but rather confronts the man himself, making a very awkward situation.  Ultimately however we simply do not have enough information to make a proper judgment as to who the guilty party is.  But we do know that we must unequivocally condemn them for either preying on young boys or for ruining the reputation of a good man.  The old nun appears to suffer from scrupulosity and is haunted by doubts and fears of sin in her own life and the lives of others.  She is a sympathetic character once we begin to understand the illness that afflicts her.  Unfortunately, the movie gives us nowhere to go from here.  It offers this woman no way to make redress, no way to ease her fears, no way to quash her doubts, and no foundation on which to build her faith.  As such, the movie creates a deplorable situation where everything becomes ambiguous and then wallows in its own doubt and moral relativism.  The movie of course will say that it is designed to make one think and that it is not meant to be "anti-Catholic", but ultimately it does neither and seems to serve largely as the all-too-familiar charges leveled against the church concerning pedophile priests, intolerant and strict old nuns, and a failing faith plagued by nagging doubts in a society in which doubt has been turned into a virtue.  As such, I feel that this film is positively harmful and its message is extremely negative and dissatisfying.  In the last scene, one searches for some hope but finds none.  Only further and further doubt persists.  Much as today's culture finds itself in.  A lack of fundamental trust where paranoia, fear, and mistrust run rampant.  A situation where it is possible to denounce those you know and work with for various crimes, real and imaginary.  And a general cloud of ambiguity that covers the whole thing making us believe that there are no moral absolutes anymore.  Thus, we see the real rot that has sank in as moral relativism inflicts its harm upon our culture and society and as doubt develops and lack of trust and paranoia ensues.<br /><br />--  a Catholic reviewer.</p></br><a href="../users/AG8U6F6226GBZ.html">AG8U6F6226GBZ</a><br/><p>I bought this movie because Meryl Streep is one of my favorite actresses.  But the film scared the h out of me.  To be around such a weird and fearful person in charge of children made me very glad I'm not a Catholic and never went to a Catholic school. I had a few mean teachers in my time, but never anything like her. Streep played the part perfectly for one of those overly fanatic religious people who think they know it all.  But the whole theme of the film, the suspicion, the cruelty, of a teacher whose in charge of children, upset me so much, I had to finally turn it off.<br /><br />After a while, I turned it back on.  It was still playing, and it was near the end.  Then I saw that cruel nun crying because of the fact that she might have been wrong by trying to ruin a priests career, and who knows about the boy? That part was totally unbelievable.  In reality, she would have been proud of what she had done, as most fanatics are when things go their way. It made me so mad, that I threw the film in the garbage where it belonged.<br /><br />First of all the movie was supposed to be in the early 60's where no one ever would have accused a priest of pedophilia!  Out of the question.  This never came up until the 90's when a few brave boys spoke up.  And even then, it took years for anyone to believe them, or the church to do anything about it, much less the civil authorities.  Rev. Law of Boston, who covered up the crimes of his pedophile priests holds a high position in Rome today.  The Church didn't care one wit. And they still don't or Law would have been excommunicated, and sitting in a jail cell in Boston along with those priests he was protecting.<br /><br />I have no sympathy for a paranoid teacher whose in charge of children.  She should not have been placed in a school. She belonged in a mental institution. Beyond that, the priest did absolutely nothing to even cause any such doubt.  Should any nice priest or the kind father of a child be considered a molester?  I think a man would go out of his way to not act suspicious.  Rather this priest was simply being nice and helpful to a kid who felt out of his place.  I guess nice priests are not acceptable in the Catholic church.  But wasn't it Jesus who said "Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven." Perhaps the Catholic Church doesnt' accept Jesus' beliefs just the Church's beliefs. Certainly this nun didn't. A priest can be kind without being a pedophile. And a difficult priest can, in fact, be one.<br /><br />Meryl Streep is a great actress and played the part of the evil, destructive nun to a T. One of her best acting jobs since Sophie's Choice.  But I hated the film, and I'm sorry she played that role.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ULSA0IRUE09E.html">A2ULSA0IRUE09E</a><br/><p>This movie was intriguing to me because of the presence of Meryl, whom I think has had some really stellar movie roles (other than her turn in "Mamma Mia", which I didn't quite like). However, there was *something* about this film and especially her performance that seemed altogether redundant. I have never seen Meryl work so hard at 'trying' to be a character, rather than just 'be' that character. It was amazing to watch. And for all the wrong reasons.<br /><br />I must say the only saving grace is Amy Adams, who is excellent as a confused and morally divided person who prefers believing the easiest explanation. On one hand, the movie wants to work as a moral tale to demonstrate that even in these so-called religious institutions, no one is sure of anything, let alone God and various forms of philosophy. On the other, it is determined to work as a star vehicle for Streep, who pouts, slams and overacts throughout the entire film - with almost no real punch to it.<br /><br />That this is considered 'serious cinema' is sad. Yes, the 'shocking' confrontation between Streep and Viola Davis is interesting only because' of the Davis characters' reaction, but once you move past that, its amazing that Viola even garnered an Oscar nomination for barely ten minutes on screen (she was good, but not great). Bewildering. Its amazing what nonsense can pass off as 'thoughtful, meaningful cinema' these days.<br /><br />Think of this as "religious-institution art-house flick for Dummies" and youre spot-on.<br /><br />Two Stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CK0VXUDVXGMN.html">A2CK0VXUDVXGMN</a><br/><p>It was a pleasure watching two of America's greatest actors play a mellow, perhaps molesting priest and her doubtless antagonist nun go at it in this thoughtful and suspenseful drama, the adaptation of a Shanley play.  Bravo! Bravo!  The meaning was left ambiguous, and was a clever comment on the controversy swirling around the Catholic priesthood today about which there can be no doubt.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This is a very interesting story about the conflict between a tradition-bound disciplinarian, Streep, and a progressive priest played brilliantly by Hoffman.  Though it takes place in 1964, the 60s upheavals are really only beginning.  Streep wants to keep things simple and controlled, Hoffman to open the church to new ideas.  While Streep is more overtly political in the way she enlists a young nun, the wonderful Amy Adams, Hoffman is also proven extremely adept at these kinds of career maneuvering.<br /><br />The pawn in the story is a solitary young black boy, the first admitted to the Bronx catholic school.  He is deeply troubled from an abusive household, yet full of potential; his mother is on his side and hoping to advance his education with the desperation of a person who know she has only one shot.  As we all know from recent allegations, the church did not deal well with the proclivities of some of its employees.  As Hoffman has lavished attention on the black boy, he becomes suspect in this regard.  The young nun is caught in between.<br /><br />Now, on the surface, it is easy to label the characters.  Streep is vicious, resentful, and seeking power as she looks back; Hoffman is a good man, a victim, a visionary who looks forward.  But of course, things may not be that simple.  Streep may be onto something.  Hoffman may not be all that he appears.  To the great credit of the playwrite, this is never definitively resolved, but left to the viewer to reason it out.  The result is an utterly rivetting drama that can be interpreted in many different ways.  I think that there is truth to everyone's point of view in the film.<br /><br />Recommended.  The film is a window into a world, a time, and a terrible human dilemma.  The acting is absolutely first rate.</p></br><a href="../users/A5KJVGJ43ZDC9.html">A5KJVGJ43ZDC9</a><br/><p>Doubt is probably a good play rendered banal by the movie screen. There's just not enough of the play, which is a series of dialogues, to fit a feature film. Nonetheless, the substance of the work packs something of a wallop, emphasizing how moral certainty does very little to serve a relentlessly relativistic universe.<br /><br />You will probably not be bowled over by Doubt because of its vehicle, but the theme has resonance and the content will not leave you until you have sorted it out. I guess this could be seen as anti-religious in a way, but I think that the characters are just useful platforms for a truth that transcends faith and churchgoing and whatnot.<br /><br />Judge ye not. A hard lesson to learn, but hey, that's the stuff of theatre. See it, and be patient with the movie itself because it's not all that great.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>The only thing I can with certainty about John Patrick Shanley's "Doubt" is that it makes the grade for the best film of 2008.  Everything else is sort of up in the air, as I'm sure this playwright turned director would have it.<br /><br />Set in a Catholic School in 1964, right around the same time of Vatican II, one could make a good case that despite being set in an atmosphere of faith this is a perfect movie for an agnostic or a lapsed Catholic.  A really anguished agnostic and lapsed Catholic.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffmann plays Father Brendan Flynn in one of the most exquisitely ambiguous performances I have ever seen.  His character is seen, indeed, "through a glass darkly" though despite the ambiguity I don't think any viewer can come away without feeling a little slime rub off.  What is the exact nature of the slime?  Is it shame over a different sexual orientation?  Or is he in fact what the hawk-like, steely Sister Alyosisus suspects him to be: a sexual predator?<br /><br />While Meryl Streep gave a very entertaining performance as the classic Nunzilla, she wasn't really as bad as many viewers of the film hyped her up to be.  I've had more frightening teachers than that in public school.<br />Having attended Catholic school nearly my entire life, I can say that "living in terror of priests and nuns" is, by and large, a myth.  There was some discipline involved, but I don't walk around crying about it decades later.<br /><br />Though she laments the increasing use of ballpoint pens, transistor radios, and progress in general, she obviously has a heart.<br />Always eager to assist Sister Veronica, an aging fellow nun who is slowly blinding,  and patient with the starry eyed Sister James (Amy Adams).  There a few moments of absolute frigidity that occur mostly when her Absolutist nature is disturbed (telling Donald's mother that she will kick the child out if she does up her unfounded allegations against Father Flynn.)  When Father Flynn suggests "secular" songs for the Christmas pageant, she becomes really chilling, insisting that "Frosty The Snowman"  is a disgusting piece of pagan heresy.  Also, Frosty should be known as a heretic and it should be broadcast all over the airwaves during Christmas.<br /><br />There's obviously a lot of resentment on Shanley's part regarding the patriarchal nature of the Church.  When Sister Aloysius and Sister James confront Father Flynn their suspicions about his relationship with the only black student in the school, Donald Miller, he sets the tone very authoritatively by strongly "suggesting" they put sugar in his tea.  His explanation for Donald's absence and the alcohol on his breath is believable.  All too believable.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie in which you have to weigh and balance every word, every nuance, and understand the symbolism if you want to get to the root of it.  Personally, I got the very strong sense that Shanley is playing both sides to evoke a sense of justice: while Father Flynn represents progressivism and Vatican II, he is very probably a child molester.  On the other hand Sister Aloysius represents the desire for female liberation and absolute Conservatism at the same time, which is merely an unresolved complex and not appealing to most viewers at all.  But out of the two of them, she is the righteous one.  This movie has to be seen more than once.  A masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Doubt is written and directed by John Patrick Shanley, who also wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning play. The film was one of the most acclaimed films of 2008 and scored Oscar nominations for all four main performances...I can honestly say that Doubt is, without a doubt, one of the best films of 2008.<br /><br />Meryl Streep plays Sister Aloysius, the dictator-like principal of Saint Nicholas Church School. Lips eternally pursed, Aloysius inspires fear in the hearts of staff and students alike. Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is the parish priest who is universally loved by all; nuns, students, superiors...Everyone except Aloysius. When Father Flynn takes an interest in a young African-American boy named Donald Miller, Aloysius warns Sister James (Amy Adams), the young and innocent history teacher, to keep her eyes open. One day, Donald Miller is called to the rectory by Father Flynn...When he returns, Sister James notices alcohol on his breath; she reports her findings to Aloysius.<br /><br />Doubt is not a mystery or a "did he or didn't he?" about the priest. If this is all you want from the film, you'll be disappointed. Doubt is about exactly what it title implies.<br /><br />Much has been made about the performances in the film...I'm about to add to this. Hoffman, Streep, and Adams all deliver powerhouse performances, but for completely different reasons. We have three actors here all delivering various degrees of performances. Streep completely disappears into her role, simultaneous getting our fear, hatred, and sympathy. Hoffman plays his role so well and with such nuance, we don't know how to feel about him. He's fascinating. Amy Adams brings such an innocent, endearing quality to her role it becomes apparent why she's one of the most acclaimed actress's of recent years...And than there's Viola Davis, who has less than 20-minutes of screen time and was nominated for an Academy Award.<br /><br />Davis is the most talked about, despite having only two scenes. In the first, she's working with Meryl Streep and actually threatens to upstage the woman. Davis plays Mrs. Miller and brings such a dramatic punch to the film; it's a travesty that an actress who pulled off such a feat did not win the Academy Award. She is the heart-and-soul of this film.<br /><br />Even the child actor's are good and don't have that annoying "clearly acting" quality.<br /><br />Anyone studying terrific acting need look no further than the scene where Father Flynn is confronted by Sister James and Sister Aloysius. I found this scene more thrilling than many action movies and the way the actors play off each other while the tension slowly builds is just wonderful.<br /><br />Movies based on stage plays are usually so rooted in their stage origins, there's little room in a film version for anything besides great acting and a great story. Well, Doubt has both as well as great set direction and great cinematography by the legendary Roger Deakins.<br /><br />Entertaining, timeless, and powerful. Doubt may not look like a very appealing movie to the masses, but it's a wonderful film with some of the best performances of 2008. Not to be missed.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></br><a href="../users/A2UUP58XPQW3GF.html">A2UUP58XPQW3GF</a><br/><p>Based on the award-winning play and adapted for the screen by John Patrick Shanley, who also directs this film, "DOUBT" is a riveting, powerful film full of raw emotional drama that registers as something truly worthy of praise. It has been made outstanding by the exceptional performances that would give you goose bumps and enough meat to talk about after the first viewing. It is just a film almost impossible to ignore with its superb direction, beautiful but simple cinematography--truly an awesome blend of solid storytelling and powerful performances. I was truly awed.<br /><br />A year after the Kennedy assassination, in a Catholic church with a school in its grounds, Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a progressive priest with ideas that defy tradition. Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) is a traditional nun who is also the school's principal, who believes in protecting and preserving known rules and old-school beliefs. The two are meant for a battle of wills and on the sidelines is na?ve sister James (Amy Adams). When Sister James brings her observations to Sister Aloysius about the things she had seen about a lone African-American student, Donald. The school principal is pushed to believe that Father Flynn may have an undesirable relationship with the young student, without the benefit of solid evidence. Flynn denies the charges that leads the elder nun to pursue an audience with Donald's mother (played by Viola Davis), leaving Sister James confused and the matter eating away at her conscience...<br /><br />I know what you're thinking--who is right and who is wrong? Did Flynn really molest the boy? With the film's very strong Catholic overtone, the direction presents a very suffocating screenplay. Both Father Flynn and Sister Aloysius appear to have the best interests of the boy in mind, both characters are sympathetic and believable; even Sister James have her heart in the right place. I suppose if there are any bad guys in this film, it would be our own PERCEPTION. It sends us to a wild moody set piece that bring us to the uttermost places of uncertainty.<br /><br />Catholic authority is also somewhat called into play as this church is obviously one divided by gender (as illustrated with the separate scenes of social intermingling at dinner). One may think that Aloysius has the motivation to grab power from Flynn, the script effectively represents the psychological dissertation between our two main characters. The film goes into the opposing viewpoints--things that need to be changed within the confines of the rectory and things that need preserving. It was a nice to touch to see Aloysius annoyed when Flynn wanted sugar in his tea. Both sides have a point, but it is difficult to take a side and nor does Shanley point an accusing finger. The dialogue is very strong and the material is well structured; the screenplay is very enthralling as it takes the viewer to behavioral actions that provokes our curiosity. Director Shanley also takes a look at the premise and methodically shows the larger picture, at the same time it kept on generating a strong uneasy feeling that can get under your skin.<br /><br />The lingering suspicion is powerfully played to its fullest and I will be honest, it is driving me crazy. The excellently staged exchanges of dialogue between Streep and Hoffman are truly awe-inspiring. I have always loved both performers and this movie just justifies my reasons as to why. The more they bicker and argue the more the truth becomes cloudy. The two have good reason to protect the details from each other's eyes, and I have to commend the script by Shanley; he obviously chose the words carefully--with the sole purpose of confusing, provoking our senses and engaging the viewer in its sequences.<br /><br />Aside from Hoffman and Streep's exchanges, there is also a very emotionally charged exchange with Mrs. Miller (Viola Davis), Donald's mother. That scene almost made my jaw drop as I was very moved with their conversation. Donald is a child with a huge problem--is Father Davis helping or is he taking advantage? Sister James doesn't think so after she had a conversation with Father Flynn in the garden. Amy James does feel a little too ditzy, and I guess that is just the way her character needed to be portrayed. The film is just a marvelous roller coaster of emotional exchanges and when you have such performers as Hoffman and Streep, you will have to prepare to be absolutely impressed.<br /><br />"Doubt" has marvelous writing that fabulously challenges the viewer to question and well, "doubt" the film's resolution. Shanley made a wise move in not dissecting the truth, and express the insidiousness of rumors and gossip. It also makes a bold statement about faith, tradition and trust that sometimes we need to listen and restrain our potential for damaging perceptions; and Shanley amazingly does so without discrediting religion. "Doubt" is a powerful motion picture since I am certain that I will be pondering its final act long after the end credits stop rolling. Those who like their moral dramas with an absolute resolution may be a little disappointed, but for those who doesn't mind pondering what they've seen are in for a treat. I like films that leave me asking questions, it is a welcome departure from the usual Hollywood fare that spoon-feeds the answers.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!! [4 ?+ Stars]</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Director/writer John Patrick Shanley measures the quality of mercy in his uncommonly well-crafted 2008 adaptation of his 2004 Broadway hit. One can imagine how well his intimate story must have played onstage as a four-actor chamber piece since the vivid personal interactions raise large questions about morality and organized religion. The title refers to the religious doubt that results when faith is not enough to reconcile suspicion with intellectual certainty. The subject of doubt is a popular priest who could be violating his position of trust and power. The question then becomes whether the severity of an accusation is enough to convict someone of wrongdoing and how the accuser must live with the consequences of raising doubt among others without the burden of proof.<br /><br />The story takes place in 1964, a year after Kennedy's assassination, in a non-segregated Bronx Catholic school. It's a time of great tumult in the church with the Second Vatican sweeping in reforms that prove unsettling to old-school Catholics like Sister Aloysius, the strict school principal who terrorizes the students with her mean-spirited, iron hand tactics. She is offended by ballpoint pens, too much sugar in others' tea, and the possible use of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001VNC">Frosty The Snowman</a> in the holiday pageant. Her adversary is also her immediate superior, Father Flynn, a compassionate young priest who is fully immersed in the daily life of his congregation, particularly with the schoolboys whom he coaches in basketball and in life's lessons. She is suspicious of his motives, and when Sister James, an innocent novice, reports that one of her students, Donald Miller, returned from a meeting with the priest behaving strangely, Sister Aloysius becomes determined to remove him from his post.<br /><br />What Shanley does particularly well with this set-up is ensure we never know the true story and whether Sister Aloysius' assumptions are based in hard evidence. The ensemble cast is superior. It becomes redundant to praise Meryl Streep, but she does bring an ardent fervor and unapologetic small-mindedness to the formidable Sister Aloysius with a convincing accent that comes by way of the Grand Concourse. She infuses her vinegary character with welcome humor. As Flynn, Philip Seymour Hoffman manages to bring enough ambiguity to the priest to make the suspicions palpable, while Amy Adams plays Sister James with her natural perkiness toned down to reflect her character's questioning conscience. As Donald's anguished mother, Viola Davis blazes with quiet authority in an impressive face-off with Sister Aloysius that ends with an unsettling revelation. Shanley brings out all the dramaturgy of his work with full gale force and does not shy away from the dark, somber theme. It's just a good thing the actors make it intensely involving as well.</p></br><a href="../users/AK0CENM3LUM28.html">AK0CENM3LUM28</a><br/><p>Doubt / B001PA0FFO<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />I have my doubts (har-har) that I went into "Doubt" with the correct mindset. I had expected one of those "mess with your head" movies where the viewer is never quite certain who was telling the truth and who was lying (or just blatantly wrong). So I was rather surprised and a bit disappointed when Philip Seymour Hoffman pretty much shows up in the first scene wearing an "Hello, I am a pedophile" T-shirt.<br /><br />Not that this was a bad call on the part of the movie-makers. Hoffman's recent roles have been enough of the "shifty, guilty, and terribly wrong" variety (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00112S8RS">Before the Devil Knows You're Dead</a>) that it would be difficult for movie-goers to jump past that particular little type-casting long enough to give Hoffman the benefit of the doubt, particularly after a couple of decades of seemingly endless priest scandals and an unforgettable viewing of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIVJH2">Deliver Us from Evil</a>. So even though a token effort is made to make Streep seem unfairly mean and spiritually shriveled, and to make Hoffman seem like a "jus' folks" kind of guy whose love for kids is completely wholesome, it's always clear that this token effort is made to excuse the doubts of the ancillary characters only, never to seriously engender doubts in the viewer.<br /><br />Not that the ancillary characters need much coaxing to believe the worst of Streep and the best of Hoffman. Adams stars across Streep as her younger foil, and her character is simultaneously frustratingly naive and yet realistically plagued with doubt. Her animosity towards Streep stems largely from an ideological difference in teaching (Adams thinks children are all unique butterflies and Streep thinks children are all unruly ruffians), but even when she makes this animosity plain and clear, Streep merely absorbs the abuse without a blink and carries on as if nothing has happened. By contrast, Hoffman reacts violently and abusively (even going so far as to incorporate the incident into an abusive and twisted sermon on "his version" of the matter) towards the slightest hint that his behavior may have been inappropriate, and Adams fails to notice anything usual or vindictive about this behavior in her haste to exonerate the priest.<br /><br />And here is the crux of the matter: Adams doesn't want Hoffman to be exonerated because she likes him, so much as she NEEDS him to be exonerated so that something awful hasn't happened under her very nose. Streep, on the other hand, is convinced of the truth and will not turn away from her convictions, but she confesses, in the movie's climax, to being haunted by doubts. The question we are left with is: What does she doubt? I do not think she doubts Hoffman's guilt or her own rightness, but rather I believe she doubts either the benevolence/existence of god or the rightness of the Catholic Church she has devoted her life to, or possibly both.<br /><br />I deeply enjoyed this movie, if not as a "who's telling the truth" thriller, then at least as a dramatic depiction of one woman taking on the world, if not to save a child then at least to purge her school of a predator. As a treatise on faith and doubts, it yields no answers, but does provide many thought-provoking questions.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I missed Doubt in theaters and have been looking forward to watching it on DVD. The acting by Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams is outstanding as expected, but the movie itself didn't really amount to much at all. It was shorter than I thought it would be (around 100 minutes) and the resolution while realistic, made the movie feel more like a waste of time. Call me crazy, but Viola Davis didn't deserve an Oscar nomination for less than ten minutes of screen time. I had high hopes for this one and even though I did like the film (thanks to the acting), I can't say that I would watch it again or encourage anyone I know to go out and rent it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Started out slowly for me, as I felt like I was watching Philip Seymour Hoffman and Meryl Streep act, rather than feeling like they were the actual characters. But as the movie moved along, I did find myself slowly giving in to the story (and the performances). Amy Adams is adequate in the third lead role, but the movie is almost stolen away by Viola Davis (even though she's only on screen for about 8-10 minutes). The film certainly raises good points that we still grapple with today - personal certainty versus actual proof (ie. Bush administration and WMD's). The biggest misstep in the movie for me comes in the very last scene, which I won't give away, but to me seemed very out of character and weakened the whole movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`Doubt' is an outstanding film with exemplary performances from both Meryl Streep and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. They both lift this film from being standard fare to being something great and with gravitas. Hoffman is a progressive priest and Streep is a puritanical nun who is desperate to see any bad in him so that she can hound him out of the church school and maintain her austere status quo. She then starts to have suspicions of inappropriate behaviour with the children, which in reality may just be an informal personality and a man in touch with his gentler side, and yet she is so certain of her suspicions that you are left doubting his behaviour by the end as well. The direction and acting is excellent and although the story could have been resolved more fully, it gave you enough to become fully involved in the plot. In fact, it may have deliberately left the ending slightly ambiguous so that you feel the doubt that other characters also feel and if that was the intention it was a masterly cinematic trick. This has top performances from the main cast and an engaging plot and is well worth watching at some point. Even for those of us who are fatigued with seeing yet another catholic scandal film, this is so well portrayed that it is worth viewing anyway.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/AJLYAY1G5Z8GE.html">AJLYAY1G5Z8GE</a><br/><p>This film is so powerful because it is based on a very powerful dialogue. There isn't much going on in the movie. Just powerful dialogues between the major actors/actresses in the film.<br /><br />If you are looking for a movie that will keep you thinking about the words and ideas you are hearing, go for this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UFV4HALV2OXW.html">A1UFV4HALV2OXW</a><br/><p>Doubt is an excellent, engaging film with a great cast led by Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman. The film is set in 1964, in a Catholic elementary school in New York City. Streep plays the principal of the school, a very traditional and rigid nun. Hoffman plays a priest in the parish, with more progressive views. The story focuses on a conflict between these two characters. It is one of those thought-provoking films that compels you to talk about it afterward, since it allows the viewer to absorb the story based on one's own background and perspective.</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>I recently got around to watching Doubt, the onscreen drama starring Meryl Streep, Amy Adams and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Wow. It was not as dark a movie as I had feared, performances are uniformly astonishing and the film keeps you second-guessing (which, I imagine, is the point).<br /><br />Inevitably, Streep is the star of this film. The legendary actress plays Sister Aloysius Beauvier, a nun who serves as the principal at a Catholic school in the Bronx. The year is 1964, and the school has just admitted its first black student (Donald, played by Joseph Foster) in the fall. There's a charismatic new priest in St. Nicholas parish - Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Father Flynn often finds himself at odds with Sister Aloysius' strict ways with the schoolchildren and her faith.<br /><br />So when young, naive Sister James (Amy Adams) mentions to Sister Aloysius that Father Flynn may have taken a bit too much interest in Donald, Sister Aloysius becomes certain that the relationship has developed into something improper.<br /><br />Without proof, the two nuns confront Father Flynn, who defends his innocence. Undaunted, Sister Aloysius schedules a meeting with Donald's mother (played with heartbreaking genius by Viola Davis). The woman, who is dealing with her own suspicions about Donald's nature as well as violence in the home, provides Sister Aloysius with no method through which to exercise her moral certainty.<br /><br />As Sister Aloysius becomes more and more definite in her efforts to oust Father Flynn, questions of faith and doubt emerge in stark relief.<br /><br />What can I say about this movie? Meryl Streep is a goddess, and anyone who denies it is a fool. The woman is Proteus-like in her ability to inhabit any character with utter credibility. It completely blows my mind. Adams and Hoffman aren't slouches, either, but Streep owns this movie.<br /><br />Though the story line isn't a happy one, rest assured that the film focuses on Sister Aloysius and her quest. The film purposefully neither confirms nor denies the suspected relationship between the priest and the boy, leaving the viewer to wonder if the nun's conviction has any truth.<br /><br />A fascinating character study. Worth watching for the performances alone, although the film's moral statement about "innocent until proven guilty" does make one think.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYMJ96STIRW.html">AMYMJ96STIRW</a><br/><p>This is a sad but true chronicle of the tremendous impact of so-called "men of God" who take license with the lives of others and go unpunished...at least here on earth.<br />This movie shows once again, that Meryl Streep is a major talent and when she finally receives the Oscar that she has deserved for so long, one has to wonder what role it may be that will precipitate it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>The original play "Doubt" was a powerhouse built around four actors, suspicion and a new vs old church divide that made it intensely dramatic. However, that kind of staging would be near impossible to film, and the movie adds characters (like the young boy Donald who is the source of the conflict) and a church full of congregents. The movie is still a heavy, densely wordy affair, but the inclusiuon of more bodies and business dilutes the ambiguity, or the "doubt" as it were.<br /><br />However, when you have Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman turning in their most ferociously thesbian performances possible, "Doubt" still comes out as a really good movie. Both Amy Adams as the innocent (who utters the scene stealing line above) and Viola Davis (who torpedoes the self-rightous certainty of Sister Aloysius with the rules of the world) as the mother who will protect her son through any or all make deeply impressive supporting appearances, and all work with John Patrick Shanley's fine adaptation of his original play. Togther, these folks were all nominated for Oscars, that is how good each individual is here.<br /><br />Streep, as Sister Aloysius Beauvier, takes that crusty old nun that everyone remembers from Sunday School and infuses her with both wit, wisdom and Nunly Facism. Hoffman's Father Flynn is the new breed of Priest, a big Catholic teddy bear who thinks the church must become more human and humane, but Sister Aloysius sees that as both weak and suspect. When she sees Father Flynn acting with (what she sees as) undue compassion towards the new kid, she decides to drive him out of the church at all costs...even if so much of her certainty may be flawed by her mistrust of change.<br /><br />At a very taut 100 minutes, "Doubt" works both as an indictment of the scandals within the Catholic Church and as an allegory to the modern day, when "Change" became a buzzword in the making of a war and a new president. Viola Davis, with maybe 10 minutes of screentime, tears all of the arguments into shreads, making the theme of doubt in the movie play right into the ambiguous ending. Powerful stuff and worthy of all its awards and nominations.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>Most playwrights should never direct their own work. John Patrick Shanley's 2008 adaptation of his Pulitzer Prize-winning "Doubt" cries for the guiding hand of filmmaker Sidney Lumet, a master at stage-to-screen translation. Though Shanley has assembled a memorable cast, he knows little about cinematic technique. "Doubt" lacks the overall dramatic impact of its Broadway counterpart - even the denouement falls flat. Fortunately, the actors are excellent. Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams make the film version worth watching, yet it is Viola Davis' heart-wrenching portrayal that stays in the memory. However, you must see "Doubt" on stage to fully appreciate its emotional power.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>I still do not understand why critics savaged reviews for this movie.  I have found it to be so compelling on many different levels.  Meryl Streep plays a nun in the middle private school that is stern where even a local priest calls her a "dragon".  She is a school principal dedicated to discipline, tradition and propriety.  School priest in the other hand is likable, he is popular with students and seemingly easy going.  However, the mutual dislike between him and the principal leads them both to a different level of intellectual battlefield.<br /><br />Nun is concerned about priest's close relationship with one of the school students that also happens ot be black.  Her suspicions are confirmed in one of the most stunning moments in the film when nun meets boys mother (shinning star actress Viola Davis).  The revelation between the two women about the boy's present state and his future is the soul of the movie.  Both nun and mother wish the best for the school and the young man, but what shall be the price of securing his destiny and the well being of the students of the school?<br /><br />"Doubt" is about crisis of faith, of individual's choosing to do the right things and any decent person's making moral transgressions for the greater good. People's actions and outside demeanor is not always a reflection of the purity of their soul.  At the end, we learn that everyone has a price to pay for their actions and their internal struggles. Wonderful movie, great performances.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>Religion is built on faith. By definition, it must be, for it cannot prove its claims and most of what we know about science refutes most of what's said by religion.<br /><br />It is using faith that Sister Alloyicious (Meryl Streep), bases her entire case against a charasmatic new priest (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). He's the embodiment of Vatican 2, and she's... well, probably Mel Gibson's grandmother.<br /><br />The priest is doing things like giving sermons in English, that talk about peace, compassion and tolerace. He's taking sugar in his tea. He's even using a ballpoint pen! His ideas and his way of doing things are vastly different from those of the good Sister, so she's willing to believe, on the slightest, flimsiest theory, that the priest is molesting one of the boys in his care.<br /><br />It's fascinating to watch as she builds up this case in her own mind, eager to believe it is true. She talks with the priest, with the boy's mother (who is, btw, one of the most pragmatic characters I've ever seen on screen), with another nun, with just about everyone, and though everyone defends the priest against her, she refuses to listen, cause she has certainty. She has faith. She has no doubt.<br /><br />The character studies here are fascinating, as are the contrasts in this very important time of the Church's life, as is the rush to judgement and the power of rumor. Merely by raising the suspicion in people's minds that this priest may be molesting a child, she makes it real, no matter if it is or isn't.<br /><br />This is a very good movie and one I'd highly recommend. See what can happen when faith takes the place of rational thought.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UW83R0JOZZ6.html">A2UW83R0JOZZ6</a><br/><p>"What do you do when you're not sure?" asks Father Flynn of his congregation at the inception of "Doubt", a film that centers on the doubt of the truth, doubt of faith, doubt of the nature of man and doubt of self while delving into the controversial dilemma of child molestation within the Catholic church and the church's efforts to cover it up.  Winner of four Tony awards including Best Play in 2005, author John Patrick Shanley's superb story is one of the more smooth and succinct Broadway-to-Hollywood transitions to come along in a great while.<br /><br />It is a blustery winter in 1964 at the St. Nicholas Catholic Church.  Sister Aloysius (Streep), the principal of St. Nicholas Catholic primary school, presides over her students with fear and intimidation.  Though stern and seemingly mirthless on the surface, Aloysius is empowered by the grace of God and believes in the saving of her student's minds and souls through discipline and contrition.  Father Flynn (Hoffman), the new parish priest, views things differently, his friendly and newfangled approach bristling the staunchly traditional Sister Aloysius to a curious degree.  She views him from the beginning with a critical gaze, his aim to change things rustling her old feathers considerably, but it isn't until he takes a special interest in Donald Miller (the school's one and only black student) that the seeds of doubt are planted in her mind.  Sister James (Adams), a novice in her profession as well as in the ways of the world, thinks Flynn charming and believes his interest in Donald is with good intention.  But time and experience have Sister Aloysius believing otherwise and she begins digging deeper for the truth, those seeds of doubt now taking root in her heart.  All  the while Flynn rebukes her interrogations but oddly enough does everything except proclaim his innocence.  The peripatetic winds that Sister Aloysius complains of begin to mount in their intensity the further she prods into the situation, and when she and Flynn finally confront one another, a literal and figural storm has brewed, their fury towards one another brilliantly underscored by the blinding flash of lightning and the menacing roll of thunder from the heavens above them.<br /><br />"Doubt", much like its title, creeps into the subconscious, festering, and it is a masterpiece in all its subtleties, particularly its use of visual metaphor.  Whereas other films practically beat you over the head with suspense, "Doubt" whispers it in your ear, its calm, hushed tone provoking a more attentive eye and ear to its proceedings.  With John Patrick Shanley serving as writer and director for the adaptation of his successful stage play, "Doubt" remains nearly 100% intact and fully realized according to Shanley's vision.  Foregoing visual effects and tricky camera angles, the play's impact and presence on a stage comes through on screen, the simplistic beauty of its cinematography and the focus on its small but superior cast making it an exquisite film that centers solely on its deeply dramatic story.<br /><br />Each of the four roles is a labyrinthine ship commanded only by the best captain, and each actor navigates and mans their vessel with power and precision.  It comes as no surprise that all four actors were nominated for Oscars (though none of them won) as well as a nomination for Shanley for his screenplay (which lost out to "Slumdog Millionaire", a HUGE upset in my humble opinion).  Adams nails the wide-eyed innocence of Sister James and offers a quiet intensity while Streep glowers, smirks and steadfastly barrels through as Sister Aloysius.  Hoffman imbues Flynn with an intriguing mixture of mischief and tenderness while at the same time suggesting with a glint of his eye a covertness that Sister Aloysius immediately detects.  Though Davis is only present for two scenes in the film's 104-minute runtime (one in which she doesn't even have any lines), her small role as Mrs. Miller is sublime, made memorable in her capable hands; she even manages to make one forget that a powerhouse like Streep is standing right there with her.<br /><br />This single disc DVD edition comes with some interesting extras, the most intriguing being a featurette entitled "Doubt: From Stage to Screen" in which Shanley shares his own thoughts and feelings about the play, its transition from stage to screen, commentary from its actors and an impromptu interview he conducted with Streep.  Shanley chose to shoot the film in the neighborhood he himself grew up in, centering his outdoor shots on the very intersection where he attended Catholic school in the Bronx.  He also managed to come into contact with Sister Margaret James (the very woman on whom the character Sister James is based) from the school he attended and she served as a technical advisor on the film, helping Streep and Adams with the application of their habits and rosaries.  "The Cast of Doubt" is a casual sit down with the four main actors, "Scoring Doubt" reviews composer Howard Shore's inspiration for the film's music and "The Sisters of Charity" offers an enlightening background on the origin of the Sisters of Charity of New York and the humbling, often thankless work of the nuns.<br /><br />Bottom line: Truly one of the best films of 2008, "Doubt" will leave a lasting impression on viewers who crave a good, absorbing drama that offers them the opportunity to form many different interpretations from its complex story.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>"Doubt", the movie, opens up the play giving it interesting exterior scenes such as the convent garden and views of the community, but the congregation other than the students isn't really drawn into this cloistered drama. The three participants are keeping this situation among themselves, a church thing.<br />Meryl Streep as the Mother Superior, the school principal, is the avenging angel, courageous, perhaps foolhardy, serving as the accuser, the jury and judge. That's a lot of authority residing in one righteous zealot. Streep perhaps goes over the top playing the heartless, bossy creature similar to the character she played in "The Devil Wears Praada."<br />Streep plays a stereotypical Mother Superior, but does it with great dramatic power. The movie makes her into a dragon as Hoffman calls her, and yet she performs kindly acts for her fellow sisters. The other sisters (not Sister James) come out as a rather cloddish, sheepish, too cowed herd.<br />The priest played brilliantly by Philip Seymour Hoffman is the accused, and a superb Amy Adams is the young nun, Sister James, as messenger, witness and catalyst who begins to regret her role in the whole crisis. Hoffman gives two very effective sermons. The way the movie handles his sermon on gossip with feathers is brilliant.<br />We briefly see the boy's mother, Viola Davis, in a bravura performance. She knows and accepts what she is dealing with, a troubled son. A melodramatic wind and rain storm ends the stormy scene between the mother and Streep.<br />"Doubt" is about ambiguities in faith, in human relationships, in sexual identity, in the dangers of certitude. At the same time while dealing with complexities it has stereotypes and some oversimplistic touches.<br />Hoffman says, "There are people who go after your humanity." People who "kill kindness in the name of virtue." Streep says, "I know people." And "I have my certainty."<br />The early and final confrontation scenes between Hoffman and Streep are powerful and well-acted. Is there any compassion buried beneath the Mother Superior's tough, unbending exterior? Is there a genuine conscience there?<br />John Patrick Shanley wrote the stage play, the screenplay, and directed the movie, a tour de force.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>A lot of plays don't adapt well to the screen ("Love! Valour! Compassion!" anyone?); here we have a successful play being directed by the playwright. What could go wrong? Actually, NOTHING! I still don't understand why Cherry Jones didn't repeat her Tony-winning role, but the Sister Aloysius of Meryl Streep is as centered as it could be. The entire cast is flawless, and the film allows some latitude in location that the play didn't. Very talky, intelligent, fast-paced, and thoroughly focused, I haven't been so impressed in a long time. Some say Amy Adams didn't deserve her Oscar nom, but I strongly disagree. Also, young Joseph Foster, as the catalyst of the controversy, is a talented young man, and I wish him well. I recommend this film highly. I can't remember when I was so impressed by an acting ensemble. Not a weak one in the bunch. A real treat!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>Doubt. That's exactly what you feel by the end of this film. As soon as the credits roll, scenes from the film tumble around in your mind, causing you to seriously evaluate what you have just seen. You come up with your own interpretation of the events.<br /><br />Directed by John Patrick Shanley from his own play, DOUBT tells the story of an uptight, extremely conservative nun who suspects foul play in the church, when the new priest is suspected of molesting a black student. The nun, Sister Aloysius Beauvier, has good reason to accuse the progressive, somewhat libral priest of the crime. Or does she? That's one of the many questions that the film asks the characters on screen, as well as the audience. Are things REALLY what they seem to be? Or is Sister Aloysius simply out to pick a fight? She doesn't like change. Father Brendan Flynn is all for it, and he constantly tries to break through Aloysius' tough exterior. Times have changed, he says, and so must she. It is no suprise that she takes aim at him the first chance that she gets - but, once again, does she have good reason? Did the priest really molest the boy or not? Is there any reason to doubt that he did? The film presents the argument from both sides, and in my opinion, is very ambiguous in it's conclusion.<br /><br />This film is carried by the dialogue and acting, which is amazing. Meryl Streep, Philip Seymore Hoffman, and Amy Adams give some of the best performances of the year. Amy Adams shines as a young and naive nun who gives Streep reason to question Hoffman.<br /><br />SEE IT! You'll be thinking afterwards!</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Religious belief is founded in faith, the condition of believing in something that is unseen by the person of faith. "Doubt" as a concept is the polar opposite, the yin to the yang of faith, but both bound together at the hip like theological Siamese twins.<br /><br />People of faith prize the highest kind of faith - the unshaking, unswavering, unalterable faith that absolutely believes, no matter what.  I saw this kind of faith simplistically depicted in bumper stickers that proclaimed "God said it.  I believe it.  That settles it." But is it okay for a person of faith to have doubt?<br /><br />John Patrick Shanley had already proven his abilities as a writer with, for example, his Oscar-winning script to the delightful "Moonstruck".  In "Doubt" he does double-duty and directs as well.<br /><br />The four principle performers all earned Oscar nominations, and this film is uniformly excellent. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Father Flynn, a compassionate Priest who opens the film with a sermon on exactly the topic of Doubt.  We learn that the man allows a place for doubt within his faith.  St. Nicholas is a grade school in Father Flynn's parish, and the principal there is Sister Aloysius, played by Meryl Streep, is a humorless nun who not only doesn't allow for any doubt in her beliefs or actions, but also doesn't allow for pretty much any views contrary to her extremely narrow view of the world.  She despises ball-point pens, for example, because you must press harder with a ball-point pen than with fountain pens, and she has an undisguised contempt for those who use ball-point pens - such as Father Flynn.  But the rich screenplay also shows a little of the humane side of Sister Aloysius as she helps and shields an elderly nun who is going blind, fearing that the poor dear will be put out to pasture if her disappearing sight is discovered.  None of the characters are one dimensional.<br /><br />Amy Adams is superb as Sister James, a bright young nun who teaches history and withers before the stern gaze of Sister Aloysius.<br /><br />At this Brooklyn Catholic school young Donald Miller enrolls.  Donald is African-American and doesn't quite fit in.  The staff take particular note of young Mr. Miller - not wanting to single him out for good or bad, but also wanting to make him feel welcome as in 1964 a young black man may not be welcomed with open arms by the rest of the all-white school.  Father Flynn in particular seems to encourage Donald, and in an early scene Donald confides that he aspires to become a priest as well.<br /><br />Sister James sees something... or does she?  She recognizes that what she has observed is circumstantial at best - Donald was called out of class to the rectory, and she is certain that she smells alcohol on his breath when he returns.<br /><br />Sister James dutifully informs Sister Aloysius, and the stern headmistress is absolutely certain - with no doubt - of the worst thing this can imply about ball-point pen-using Father Flynn.<br /><br />Father Flynn is confronted in a series of sensational scenes by Sister Aloysius, pleading not only his innocence, but also a "how DARE you even THINK such a thing" attitude that adds...doubt... in the eyes of the audience.  But Father Flynn knows that a public accusation such as the one Sister Aloysius is certain of would ruin him.  What Priest could recover from a scandal with an altar boy, even if he could be "cleared" in an investigation?<br /><br />Viola Davis also earned an Oscar nomination as the boy's mother.  She sees the school as a way for Donald to escape both the neighborhood and her own abusive husband.  If the Priest is kind to the boy, why should she have doubt?<br /><br />The dialogue is razor sharp and as good as Shanley's script is, his words are helped immensely by the delivery and the body language of the remarkable cast.  The academy award for adapted screenplay went to "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P9KR8U">Slumdog Millionaire</a>", and I thought that film was excellent (as evidenced by my 5-star review), but I find this script a cut above. Not a tawdry story about a degenerate Priest, this is instead a story about the dichotomies that exist between moral rigidity and compassion, moral certainty and doubt, with a rich understory about the gap between the haves and have-nots, exemplified by Viola Davis as the woman who is willing to accept the possibility that a priest may be taking advantage of her son, as long as it gives the boy a possible road out of the nowhere world of their neighborhood.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>You have 62 reviews on this A budget movie with it's incredible<br />powerhouse performances and most of them rightly gave this movie great reviews.  I can't understand a review of less than three stars though.  Anyway the movie like the play makes you think hard about Doubt and inspite of the outcome of the movie we are left with incertitude that the lead character is in fact a abuser , maybe he just didn't want to have other issues dragged up in his past.  Who knows? the viewer may assume that the priest is guilty or not but the fierce performance of Meryl Streep leads us NO doubt that her character really does care about the welfare of the children in her school; even if she doesn't show it in a loving way. The movie does have alot of dialog but watching it, was to me like looking back in time, in a pretty much faithful way, to that era of history fairly accurately.  The early sixties were a time before the storm and people still were in denial about many issues and they certainly had a hard time talking about them.  This is a excellent drama and should stand the test of time because of it's great performances and<br />doubtful musings and endings.  The print looks beautiful on blu ray and every detail stands out nicely in this perfect print.  This is a movie that is a acting tour de force and blu ray is only way to go if you want to own this.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I'm going to avoid using the obvious puns here (ala `no doubt about it' or `don't doubt it' or really anything with the word `doubt' in it) and just say this as blunt and straightforward as I can.<br /><br />I really expected a lot out of `Doubt', and while it managed to hit the right tone on a few occasions the end result was very uneven.<br /><br />Taking the helm in directing his own stage play for the big screen, John Patrick Shanley had a lot to live up to.  His play was very well received and so getting it onto the big screen was going to be difficult.  You have to be careful not to do your already adored work an injustice.  Getting the goddess known as Meryl Streep and the impressive Philip Seymour Hoffman to sign on to do your film is a step in the right direction.  Filter in `it' girl Amy Adams and veteran supporting player Viola Davis (the type of actress you recognize for her face, not her name) was also a blessing.<br /><br />But, can a writer actually direct his play on the big screen with the right amount restraint and power to make it enjoyable?<br /><br />I am in the minority here when I say that John Patrick Shanley's direction is probably the best thing about this movie; aside from Viola Davis.  Honestly, he really nailed it for me, and all the deemed clich&eacute; tricks he incorporated (ala the burnt out light bulbs and storm sequences) actually elevated the mood for me and really captured the essence of what `Doubt' was all about.  I even thought that his direction was slightly better than his writing.  The screenplay is powerful indeed, and the moral imposed on us is brilliantly developed; but I must admit that adapting a stage play holds varied obstacles; mainly dialog.  A play is very `dialog' reliant, while a film does not have to be such.  Some stage/screen adaptations remain dialog heavy because the story requires it (ala `Long Day's Journey into Night') but for the most part, if done right, the dialog can be trimmed and the surroundings can be used to emote what mere words cannot really convey.  I feel that Shanley's effort to transfer his play was only partially successful in that regard.  There are sequences that are almost boring because the words are not backed up by the needed emotion.  This could be a problem lying mainly in the actors themselves, but I feel that in some instances the dialog could have been trimmed to leave room for the actors to act with more than just their mouths.<br /><br />Take Viola Davis for instance, an actress who has a mere eight minutes or so of screen time and really only a mouthful of words to say and yet she manages to capture every ounce of this woman's state of affairs and dances circles around Streep.<br /><br />Aside from Davis the acting gets a little more hit-or-miss for me.  Amy Adams is serviceable yet nothing spectacular at all.  She hits the right emotional confusion in her final scenes, but it isn't anything truly noteworthy.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is very good in some scenes, and by that I mean VERY good.  In others though, he almost disappears into the background.  It's not that his performances is bad, because it's not, it's just that he lacks his usual strength in some scenes.  Streep was a surprise to me.  I had heard a lot said about how campy her performance was, but I didn't believe it.  Honestly, it's not wholly campy as much as it is just uneven.  She doesn't seem to have a complete handle on her character, and that's not something I've ever seen out of Streep.  Some scenes she's nearly flawless and yet in others it was almost as if a completely different actress was doing the role; and then to get walked all over like she was by all of her co-stars (Davis stomps all over her, Hoffman dominates her in their final confrontation scene and even Adams steals her thunder in the scenes finale).<br /><br />This is not `prime' Streep.<br /><br />The films subject of faith and morality, of suspicion and pride, of maliciousness and ethics is delicately handled and for the most part effective.  When the film ends the viewer is left with the same feeling of `doubt' Sister Aloysius is left with, so the film is effective.  It's just not as effective as it could have been had all of the elements come together as I expected they would.  I know that this is a raved film that landed on quite a few top ten lists and managed five Oscar nominations, but I'd only give it one (Davis in UNDENIABLE) and leave it at that.  I'd recommend it, sure, for it is not entirely without merit but I would not label it a masterpiece or even a `must see' film at all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I know many people really liked this film, but despite having some good performances, this film just didn't completely grab me. The story is interesting, but I found it to be predictable and slow. The cast is very good, but certainly not any of their best work, although I found Streep's character to be amusing at times. The story goes where I expected it to go and if not for the last few minutes the film wouldn't have gotten that extra half a star. I liked the ending and it helped me to appreciate the film for what it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ST1XBL6EQTBV.html">A1ST1XBL6EQTBV</a><br/><p>Kudos to Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman,<br />Viola Davis & Amy Adams!!<br />WOW!!--This film is powerful and definitely oscar-worthy<br />in a year of many oscar-worthy performances.<br />The writing an direction are amazing as well..very well put together.<br />Set in a catholic church-school in 1964, a young black kid from<br />a low income/low self-esteem background is sent there by<br />his struggling mother (Viola Davis) who wants her son to<br />have better opportunites and a chance to dodge the evils<br />of his environment, but has she unknowingly<br />made her child jump out of the skillet and into the fire?<br />A fire that most people at that time found to be unimaginable!!<br />But we who watch with 2009 eyes know all too well that strange<br />things have gone on in these places that were once considered<br />to be beyond reproach and sacred enough that we would commit<br />our most precious assets (our children) to without even<br />a second thought!<br />Meryl Streep plays the stern, dogmatic and no-nonsense<br />Sister Superior role to the max in this, and once she senses<br />that something isn't right with the relationship between<br />the Preist (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and the young black kid,<br />she is like a pitbull in her determination to get<br />to the bottom of things!<br />Amy Adams plays her role with a wide-eyed trusting<br />innocence until that innocence is shattered by a chance<br />discovery that awakens many doubts!<br />I don't like to give spoilers in my reviews because<br />I like to leave room for the ones who haven't<br />seen a particular film to judge for themselves.<br />But make no mistakes!--This is a brilliant and stirring<br />piece of work, a must-see and very deserving<br />of it's 5 Oscar Noms!<br />Check it out if you already haven't!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>Amazing performances from Streep, Hoffman, Adams and Davis.  `DOUBT' is a thought provoking film that leaves you feeling a bit unsettled at the film's end.<br /><br />"DOUBT" is a film based on the Tony Award winning play "Doubt: A Parable" by John Patrick Shanley.  The play was so successful would take the popular play and bring it to the big screen and Shanley would be the screen writer and director.<br /><br />Eventually, the film struck a chord with critics as "DOUBT" received five Academy Award nominations for Best Actress (Meryl Streep), Best Supporting Actor (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Best Supporting Actress Amy Adams and Viola Davis and Best Adapted Screenplay (John Patrick Shanley).  And after watching the film, you realize that this film and the talents are definitely deserving of each of those nominations.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"DOUBT" is featured in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ration of 1:85:1.  The picture quality is very good as you can see the pores on the skin of Philip Seymour Hoffman, so it is done quite well.  But the film is mostly shot indoors.  The colors are not so vibrant as the sisters and Father Flynn are typically wearing black and white.  The school is featured in shades of brown and when shots are done outdoors, skies are gray and definitely not scenes that showcase much colors.  In a way, there is a sort of darkness when watching the film, even though it is a film that takes place in a Catholic school.<br /><br />Cinematography courtesy of the talent Director of Photography Roger Deakins ("No Country for Old Men", "Shawshank Redemption", "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" and many more), Deakins knows how to capture a mood and since he is one of my favorite DP's, he manages to capture light and dark moods of the film.<br /><br />As for audio, audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD (48 kHz/24-Bit) and French 5.1 Dolby Digital.  One thing that really came out quite well through my system in hearing the various soundtrack in DTS-HD is the music.  From the choir to the score, it comes out quite clear during the film.  For the most part, the film is dialogue-based.  Dialogue is clear but this is not a film to expect major usage of your rear channels.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"DOUBT" comes with several informative special features:<br /><br />  * From Stage to Screen--(19:06) An intimate discussion with playwright, screenwriter and director John Patrick Shanley about the history of "Doubt", including his inspirations for the story, the acclaim the play's Broadway run received, the Pulitzer Prize and the process of adapting it for the screen.

A fun and insightful conversation with the talent and their feeling about the film and if the critics would get it.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />"DOUBT" is a thought provoking film.  Taking what we have seen in the last decade with certain pastors accused and having gotten away for child molestation, "DOUBT" tries to show viewers that even back in 1964, a perspective of how this was happening and despite some people having doubts about a priest and a few of those individuals with a close relationship with the younger altar boys, what makes this film much more entertaining is watching Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman really going off each other and both delivering powerful performances.<br /><br />Meryl Streep's transformation to Sister Aloysius is just impressive and her ability to project intimidation to even the viewer showcases her multiple-award winning talent.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is just a man who is well liked but to Sister Aloysius, it's about how far she will go to use her intimidation against him.  But as intimidating as she is to the Father.  The truth is that the system and hierarchy of how things are handled in the church reside in the leadership of men, not so much towards the women.  So, Hoffman then engages in intimidation towards Sister Aloysius.  Needless to say, the exchange between both individuals is quite powerful.  Which one of these individuals engages in their own perfidy?<br /><br />The other impressive performances go to Amy Adams as Sister Jane.  She exhibits innocence, purity and someone trying to comprehend why Sister Aloysius is the way she is and if she can possibly bring something new to the school with her warmer style.  Unfortunately, this style is similar to Father Flynn's and a style that Sister Aloysius is against.  So, to see the fear and intimidation that the Sister Jane is feeling is well projected by Adams.<br /><br />And Viola Davis as Mrs. Miller.  Despite having only several minutes on screen, her performance as a mother who has seen her son tormented and defeated, beaten and made to feel as an outcast, is willing to let him allegedly be in the companionship of the father, because he is the only person that has been there to protect him.  Twisted logic it may be, but considering the time this film takes place and that he was the sole Black person being integrated into the school, you feel sympathy for Mrs. Douglas but at the same time feel a bit disgusted.  Nevertheless, Viola Davis really did a great job portraying the mother in this film.<br /><br />"DOUBT" is indeed a powerful and though provoking film.  The final minutes leave you feeling a bit unsettled.  But the film is indeed a pleasure to watch because of the power of the performances by the four key talents of the film.<br /><br />They made their characters so believable and because of that, "DOUBT" was able to flourish into this intriguing and gripping film.  By the end of the film, you have no doubt in your mind that Streep, Hoffman, Adams and Davis were definitely deserving of their Academy Award nominations.  Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>Doubt, based on the Tony award winning play, is perhaps the most well acted film of the year, with four of its stars being nominated for Oscar's and a screenplay that blurs the line between who is right and who is wrong.<br /><br />Sister Aloysius is the strict, hard nosed principle of the local Catholic school who finds herself in the midst of a personal battle between one of the priest, Father Flynn, who may or may not be abusing one of the altar boys. With the help of a fellow nun, the two of them investigate to uncover the truth and bring justice to light.<br /><br />As mentioned before, this film is superbly acted. Meryl Streep, already a legend, earned her fifteenth nomination for her role, who balances wit, steely demure, and when she let loose in some of the confrontations, its a very powerful thing to watch. Phillip Seymore Hoffman imbues Father Flynn with so much warm and kindness it most certainlty instills doubt in the viewer if he truly is capable of such a horrible act. Amy Adams acts as the mediator between the two, always holding her own against the two experience actors. And finally Viola Davis, who joins the select few actors to make the most out of a limited role.<br /><br />The film is very shady about the details about the crime and never gives any explicit details. This causes you to wonder, did Father Flynn do it? Is Sister Aloysius wrong? As the film goes on, you get little snip its of details that one moment will say the two nuns are right and then the next putting that questioning feeling in you and by the end of the film (spoiler alert! do not read on if you have not seen the film!) you are left to wonder, did Father Flynn really do it? or was it all just an overblown lie?<br /><br />This is a must see film for anyone who has followed the award season.</p></br></body></html>

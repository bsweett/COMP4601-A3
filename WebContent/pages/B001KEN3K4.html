I did not expect much from this film and saw it only because I enjoy Steve Carell's work in The Office. This film was more funny than the original series and I couldn't stop laughing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LH77PBDFEO3F.html">A3LH77PBDFEO3F</a><br/><p>Get smart was okay, kinda funny but not great and not hilarious. Granted, I have never been a big fan of the TV show, so maybe I am not the target audience, but after some pretty good reviews from reviewers that I often agree with, I thought I'd give it a shot, and as I said, it wasn't a bad movie, but I'm glad that I only rented the video on demand from Amazon, because I doubt that I would want to re-watch this movie again.<br /><br />So here's the deal, if you LOVE 'Get Smart' you will probably like this movie very much; however, if you just like Steve Correl, Ann Hathaway and the Rock, then I would just rent this like I did.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I remember when I was a kid watching reruns of `Get Smart' all the time.  It was seriously one of my favorite shows.  Granted, I haven't seen the show in years, but the memories I have are still very fond, and so when this little remake was released I was all sorts of excited.<br /><br />It was worth getting excited over.<br /><br />Steve Carell steps into the telephone/shoes of Maxwell Smart, an agent for CONTROL who is just waiting for his chance to work in the field.  When their secret facility is destroyed by members of KAOS Smart is sent into the field alongside the beautiful Agent 99 in order to stop this evil organization.  Agent 99 is rather reluctant, since this would be Smart's first mission and he is a bit of a klutz, but she has no choice.<br /><br />What follows, is awesome.<br /><br />I can't even count how many times I laughed throughout this hilarious romp, for just about every joke lands and just about every thrill actually thrills.  Carell is just superb as Smart, giving him this charming quality that I didn't think he could pull off.  I am not the biggest fan of Carell's, but my friends love him.  I just never got his humor.  This changed my mind about him.  Dwayne `The Rock' Johnson is actually really funny here.  I've been impressed with his acting since first seeing him in `The Rundown'.  Sure, he hasn't chosen remarkable films to make, but he is a far better actor than a lot of those `rapper turned actors' we have floating around almost every movie.  Alan Arkin is memorable as the Chief.  His quick wit and sharp delivery elevate his scenes.<br /><br />The film belongs to Anne Hathaway though.  She is funny and charming and seductive and luminous as Agent 99.<br /><br />This girl is just having the best year ever, seriously.  A few years ago she was taking a backseat to everyone she filmed with, and now she is outshining her co-stars and raking up some impressive awards (for her performance in `Rachel Getting Married', a film I am so anxious to see).  I have been a fan of hers since `The Princess Diaries' (yes, I saw that) and thought she was stellar in both her Oscar contending films (`Brokeback Mountain' and `The Devil Wears Prada') so I am thrilled to finally see her getting the honorable mentions instead of everyone around her.<br /><br />`Get Smart' is very funny and very entertaining.  My one complaint is that it does feel about twenty minutes too long.  The ending could have been trimmed a tad (this is a family comedy, not a baity drama...short and sweet is the name of the game) but that isn't to say that the last twenty minutes isn't enjoyable.  It is still funny and action packed, and it adds to the story (twists, oh there have to be twists) but it does feel as though it is dragging a bit.<br /><br />That is my only complaint though, and the film still gets a very excitable B+, maybe even an A-.  It is fun for everyone and a film I wholeheartedly recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P1508PZ0UADD.html">A3P1508PZ0UADD</a><br/><p>I liked it, my wife liked it and my 15 year old daughter liked it.  I grew up watching the original TV series, and this is not a repeat of that, so don't expect it.  What it is, is an updated version of what might have happened if we never had the TV show.  Acting is great and it is very funny.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JHHYYOOO4DS6.html">A2JHHYYOOO4DS6</a><br/><p>I didn't expect this movie to be so funny since there are so many of its kind around. Steve Carell pulls of the perfect agent 86. Is he really smart but covers over it with goofiness or is he just plain dumb yet manages to get it right sometimes. The scene with him acting as marriage counselor in the midst of the fight scene was truly hilarious. This is a movie one can relax to and have lots of laugh.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>I remember watching "Get Smart" as a kid and loving the goofiness of it then. It was Mel Brooks at his slapstick best, and the pairing of Don Adams with Barbra Feldman remains one of the more iconic pairings in TV history. The best thing about this filmatic adaptation is that he maintains the zany spirit of the original. That's due primarily to the comic capabilities of Steve Carell as the new Maxwell Smart.<br /><br />Carell, who has proved over and over that he shares the knack for comedy with folks like Steve Martin or Jim Carrey, provides the anchor for the films best moments. His deadpan delivery of clueless everyman is perfect for Max, who starts the film as the best details man in CONTROL, but wants more than anything else in the world to be a secret agent. When he finally passes the test, Chief (a spot on Alan Arkin) tells Max that he's SO good at details that the bureau can't let him out of the building.<br /><br />A chance snafu occurs that forces Max onto spy detail, and along with a deft Anne Hathaway as Agent 99, they go to bring done a plan by CHAOS to sell nukes. Globe-trotting silliness ensues, along with plenty of good jokes, physical comedy and nods to the original series. (Watch for the brief cameo with Mel Brooks, and Bill Murray as the hidden Agent 13.) While the pace is snappy and there is obviously a sequel baiting ending, there are a few things that would have made this a better film.<br /><br />Maxwell Smart, in the original, was not oafish or that aware of his ineptitude. In fact, it was is boisterous self-confidence that often made him get into problematic situations. "Get Smart" the movie didn't hit that target. Also, the political parody and bite in the TV series was always subtle, so a hamfisted 9/11 George Bush slam seemed both awkward and pointless, even while Ziegfried line about dead celebrities and their "razor-sharp political advice" almost made up for it. Should the inevitable sequel arrive, hopefully these things will be addressed. I am already envisioning the Hymie flick....</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>As original ideas are hard to come by, it seems that eventually most every successful `classic' television series will be considered as the basis for a feature film.  With a history of rather abysmal results through the years, some who are actually familiar with the subject programs, have come to expect very little of such projects.  The world is decidedly different some forty years later, and the film version of Get Smart, retains little of the relevance, and even less of the charm or humor of the original series.  Like so many other big screen adaptations, the film attempts to capitalize on whatever cache may remain in a classic franchise, utilizing just a few threads from the TV series.  As the target audience for the film are those who may never have seen Don Adams as Agent 86, Barbara Feldon as Agent 99, Ed Platt as The Chief, and Bernie Kopell as Siegfried, this lack of connection was probably deemed irrelevant.<br /><br />By making Max and 99 strangers, the heart of what made the original Get Smart so special is removed.  Instead of a warm familiarity, the characters start coldly at ground zero.  Besides his height, Steve Carell bears few similarities to the original Maxwell Smart.  Anne Hathaway may be talented and charming, but the version of 99 she is given, has little in common with Feldon's character.  There are winks and nods to the past; 86's red Tiger Sunbeam convertible and shoe phone, Agent 13 (Bill Murray) in a tree, Fang the dog, and Bernie Kopell's cameo, to name a few, but they really don't make any substantial contribution to the story.  With a skeleton framework, and main characters that are mere shells of the original, this Get Smart is firmly targeted for today's audience.<br /><br />As such, the film isn't very funny, and only because of a strong finish, is it even a halfway decent action/adventure flick.  Up until the setting shifts to Los Angeles, Max and 99, clash and step on each other toes.  Perhaps the only bit in the entire film that is humorous is the dance number at the party, and there again the two leads are going against each other.  The Chief (Alan Arkin), and Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson) are mainly on the bench until they get to LA, where their contributions do help rescue Get Smart from forgettable oblivion.  The filmmakers consulted with series creators Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, but it apparently didn't help much.  One good decision was to play down the delivery of Max's classic lines.<br /><br />The film can also be viewed in a mode where alternate takes and versions are inserted, supposedly providing '62% more laughs'.  That stated improvement is not only hyperbole, but is false.  The alternate gags usually aren't funny, and instead of being a positive, these lame alternates just confirm how badly the writers were lost, groping for the right words.  What is really unfortunate is that the producers apparently fail to understand that reinserting the discarded material, does not cast the film or the filmmakers in a better light.  Instead they both seem rather pathetic, similar to watching a standup comedian bomb over and over again, with bad joke after bad joke.<br /><br />Now that the premise has been set, a sequel is probably being planned.  Siegfried can be retrieved from the drink, and he and Starker could be featured more prominently.  Hymie should be good to go.  In the 'sensitive' villain Dalip (Dalip Singh), they have their version of Jaws (from the Roger Moore Bonds), primed for the next adventure.  Jaws did a parachute stunt in Moonraker, so next perhaps Dalip on a cable car?  Hopefully now that Agents 86 and 99 have developed a relationship, the writers will do a better job, because there is really huge room for improvement.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>I approach most translations of TV series to the large screen with some trepidition.  Some are good like "The Fugitive" and...um...that's the only one I could think of.  "Get Smart" isn't bad however though not particularly memorable.  The makers were wise by stylistically departing from Mel Brooks and Buck Henry's original blueprint but sprinkle the film with some amusing references to the original.  Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway were also wise in not imitating Don Adams and Barbara Feldon as Agents 86 and 99.  What jeopardizes the film's chances to continue as a franchise is that it's bogged down with an unmemorable central plot that makes it indistinguishable from, say, "Johnny English".  Not a real disappointment but probably only worth a rental or checked out if it comes on cable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K0UT3GA4QQG5.html">A1K0UT3GA4QQG5</a><br/><p>It is specially appealing for those of us who remember and enjoyed the original`s silly humor. Agent 86 gets a 10!</p></br><a href="../users/A2BQBLCKJHP65G.html">A2BQBLCKJHP65G</a><br/><p>Being a TV obsessed kid in the mid 70's, my afternoons were usually filled with syndicated shows of the decade before. One of those shows that caught my eye was Get Smart. Started in 1965, this was a spy comedy as USA's answer to James Bond but with a comedic flair. Don Adams played Maxwell "Agent 86" Smart, a bumbling yet charismatic spy working for the secret organization Control in the fight against Kaos, the Russian Cold War equivalent. Surrounded by a cast of equally interesting characters including his younger, more competent female partner Agent 99 and his always frustrated in Max's foolishness boss The Chief. Get Smart was a mix of old-school spy tricks and gadgets with good word-play humor.<br /><br />Now flashing forward over forty-five years later, the Hollywood remake machine once again dips into it's pockets and pulls out yet another classic for, to put it kindly, modernization. But with today's technology in special effects, can a new team of actors bring back these spies to a world where the Cold War is a forgotten memory?<br /><br />Just looking at the new cast, you can tell that visually director Peter "50 First Dates" Segal wanted to preserve and respect the original cast in that aspect, and does so very well. Just looking at Steve Carell's resemblance to Don Adams is uncanny, and with Anne Hathaway (who's career is a bit too big now for a role like this) as Agent 99 and Alan Arkin as The Chief, you'd be hard-pressed to think of any other actor in these roles today. But one thing noticable to fans of the old series to this film will be that even though they look like the originals, acting-wise they're nowhere near close. Carell's Smart is downright dead-panned completely ignoring the standards set by Adams. Once funny lines like "Would you believe..." and "Missed it by that much" out of Carell's mouth lack any humor or flair that Adams gave them week after week. Agent 99 now seems cold and calculated lacking any of the warmth Barbara Feldon originally gave her. And as for The Chief, well he now acts like, well, Alan Arkin, instead of depressingly frustrated with 86's antics, he's angry and hot-headed to the point of violence. Add in new cast members like over-acting Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson as Agent 23, Max's rival and mentor, and nerdy tech guys Bruce & Lloyd (who during the production of this film made a spin-off film of their very own), something is very missing in this remake. Simply put, this 2008 production is just too weak as a modern day spy film and not funny enough to be a successful comedic parody. It sort of lays flat, playing out as a reminder of how great and entertaining the original 60's show was. Sure, the Russian scenes are nice (be it I doubt they were really there on set), a couple of the gadgets have a tad of laughs, and the cameos by some famous faces are cool to see, overall this film should land in the "forgotten remake pile" with copies of I-Spy, My Favorite Martian, and The Wild, Wild West.<br /><br />As for the disc itself, you can imagine the video/audio quality which is satisfactory for a 2008 film, but my review on the single-disc here should note you don't get much with just one. The only special feature here is an option to see the film in an "Expanded 62% More Laughs" version with an introduction by Carell. With it, you can see different takes and versions of scenes that already are in the film. However, with this process on other discs instead of a small icon appearing at the bottom corner of your screen, a Flash-like animation takes up the entire picture screaming at you to hit your "Enter" button now, and after four or five of these it gets extremely irritating. No wonder they gave this only 62%, because each alternate take explains why they weren't good enough to make the final cut. The Two-Disc does offer more behind the scenes, but at the cost I doubt they would be worth it when the movie itself isn't really rewatchable.<br /><br />In the end, I can only suggest this to die-hard fans of the original series, as newbies to the franchise will find this too typical and not funny enough. And each true fan should realize that one of the movie's best accomplishments is that it was made after Don Adams' passing, so he couldn't call Carell on his shoe and say "Missed it by that much".<br />(RedSabbath Rating:6.0/10)</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>American Maxwell Smart works for a Government spy agency in an administrative capacity. When the agency's head office is attacked, the Chief decides to assign Maxwell as a spy and partners him with sexy Agent 99, much to her chagrin. The duo nevertheless set off to combat their attackers by first parachuting off an airplane and landing in Russian territory - followed closely by a over seven foot tall, 400 pound goon, known simply as Dalip. The duo, handicapped by Maxwell's antics, will eventually have their identities compromised, and may be chalked up as casualties while back in America their attackers have already planted a bomb that is set-up to explode in a concert.

The names are all there, chief, 99, Kaos, Control, etc. and a few homages at the end, but it is not Get Smart.  There is some funny stuff, but not any real laugh out loud moments.  It is a decently made movie that moves along with enough humor and story to keep you interested, but not anything that makes me want to go see it again.  I would say it is average.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GB0HW46Y2EB.html">A1GB0HW46Y2EB</a><br/><p>Watching the film, "Get Smart" (2008) reminded me of two earlier big budget comedy films, "It's a Mad, Mad etc. World" (1963) directed by Stanley Kramer and "1941" (1979) directed by Steven Spielberg.  Both movies had large casts of talented performers, had a ton of money thrown at them and, for the most part simply laid there failing to fulfill their primary goals: to make audiences laugh.  Neither director had had very much experience in the comedy field, a serious handicap, which brings me immediately to Woody Allen, the most talented writer of comedy over the past fifty years, who, initially at least, had no experience in directing a motion picture.  The least of his films --  of those that he both wrote and directed -- leave both of the above films in the dust being successful and often brilliant achievements in screen comedy.  Steven Spielberg recalled the preview of "1941" at a local theater in Los Angeles.  "We stood in the lobby and the audience became quieter and quieter.  I went in and looked and several people had their hands over their ears.  I knew we were in trouble."  Today, the most successful comedy films, i.e. films that are actually funny, are those written and directed by the Coen brothers.<br /><br />I didn't watch many of the television episodes of "Get Smart" as I had largely given up watching commercial television programs by that time, but I had seen Don Adams perform many times and he was an undoubted expert as a standup comedian, having funny material and flawless comedic timing, without which, the program "Get Smart" would never have been the success that it was.  Mel Brooks, Buck Henry, Don Adams and many others shared writing credit for the series.<br /><br />Steve Carell who plays the lead in the film "Get Smart" does not impress me as a professional comedian.  I'm not certain what he is, but the one thing that he is not is funny.  Likewise the director, Peter Segal, shows little of the comedic abilities of Woody Allen or the Coen brothers with the result that nearly all of the attempts at screen comedy misfire here.  The director apparently decided to substitute fancy special effects in lieu of competant comedy writing.  The mistakes that are made in the film are numerous:  One example is Carell talking amorously to someone off camera, whom we are initially led to believe, must be an attractive woman.  But the shot of Carell talking runs too long without a cut which prematurely tells us that he is not talking to a woman.  When the cut finally does occur it turns out to be a cute little dog which does not play funny because the joke has already been sprung ahead of time.  In the trade this is known as telegraphing your punch line.  This is the fault of both the director and editor and the film is generally clumsy in this regard.  The scene in the airplane restroom with the darts misfiring is mildly funny the first time, but it goes on and on and simply becomes painful to watch.  The "comic" dance number with the overweight girl is both cruel and crude.  The joke about the poison capsule lays an egg due to inept writing.  In the hands of Woody Allen, this would have been written to be funny.<br /><br />As the film goes on (and it does go on -- and on!) it becomes less of a comedy (if that were possible) and more of a high-tech actioner indicating that apparently no one involved had a clear idea of what the film was actually intended to be, the final 20 minutes essentially being an incoherent mess of special effects and chases.<br /><br />For those of us old enough to remember the "Fibber McGee & Molly" radio show: when Fibber McGee would spring a joke that got groans instead of a laugh, Molly would say,  "T'ain't funny, McGee."  That pretty much sums up this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KW2KWKABNYNO.html">A2KW2KWKABNYNO</a><br/><p>Being a fan of the series since I was a kid, Get Smart the movie was a must-see for my summer movie list, but surely it couldn't be that good, right? Wrong, the movie works in almost every aspect, from the pitch-perfect casting, great characterization, and even the interesting story. Add in comedy that kept me laughing from start to finish, and I left the theater quite pleased.<br /><br />Since then, I've seen this film about 3 or 4 more times, and each time is as good, if not better than the first. An entertaining movie in the truest sense of the word, and it's comic action at its best. Get Smart doesn't miss it by that much, but would you believe it hits it right on the head? Believe it...

Steve Carell's Maxwell Smart isn't as nebbishy as one might expect, based on either the original role, or on Carell's other roles -- indeed, this Maxwell Smart is much more capable than the earlier incarnation, where he usually won over the forces of evil by sheer dumb luck. This film is a savvy spy parody with a light, sure touch -- it drags a little in the end (the inevitable chase scene) but overall, it's quite intelligent and genuinely funny. Worth checking out!

Very grainy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EARN5PUVIF1S.html">A1EARN5PUVIF1S</a><br/><p>Why does Hollywood persist in producing horrendous remakes of classic TV series?  Because they figure that these efforts are pre-sold commodities, I guess.<br /><br />So here is another in a continuing roster of dreadful films guaranteed to make fans of the original series wince in pain (others that come to mind include "Bewitched," "The Avengers," and "Rocky and Bullwinkle," to name just three).<br /><br />If you're going to remake a beloved TV series, then for heaven's sake, make it true to the things that people loved best about the show.  For some reason, the hacks who make these movies think that they can improve on the originals, and nine times out of ten, they can't.<br /><br />The first problem here is Maxwell Smart himself, as played by Steve Carell.  To be fair, Carell had giant shoephones to fill, those of Don Adams, who was pretty much born to play Smart on TV (and before Smart, an identical Detective character, named Glick if memory serves me, on the Bill Dana show).<br /><br />Smart is a classic comic character because, like Inspector Clouseau, he has absolute confidence in his abilities, which are continually shown to be all but nonexistent.  The huge gap between his supreme confidence and his staggering ineptitude produces the comedy.  In this movie, however, Smart is shown to be a Control analyst suffering from doubt and a midlife crisis.  That stance is just wrong for the character.<br /><br />Similarly, as blind as TV Smart was to his incompetence, he was equally blind to his source of greatest good fortune -- the devotion to him shown by the beautiful and extremely competent Agent 99, who prevails as often as he fails.<br /><br />In the show, 99's adoration was sweet if misguided.  Here, 99, as played by Anne Hathaway, is shown to be quite put off by Smart's lack of field experience, and so their relationship starts off brittle and cold, and not at all credible when the couple do warm up by film's end.<br /><br />As for the humor of the movie, it mostly consists of sadistic sight gags like memos being stapled to people's foreheads or Max hurting himself with a tricked-out professional-strength Swiss Army Knife.  What little wit shines through comes from quotes of the famous catch phrases of the series ("Missed it by that much", "Would you believe", and the like.)<br /><br />In place of the original's sharp characterizations and humor, we get pretty photography of Moscow and one big-budget (but not very funny) chase scene.  Plus the luscious Anne Hathaway, who deserves much better fare than this.  The only extra on the DVD is a handful of alternate scenes; the ones included in the theatrical release were so painful, I opted not to endure those as well.<br /><br />So if you haven't ever seen "Get Smart" on TV, by all means check out the first season of that riotous spy spoof instead.  If you have, then do yourself a favor and steer clear of this dog (and I don't mean Agent Fang).</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>I was a fan of Don Adam's portrayal of Maxwell Smart in the original series, a show that was funny and silly, but also biting and clever far ahead of it's time. One of our daughters saw the new film and said she laughed her head off the whole way through. The Mrs. and I agreed we should check it out. We were not disappointed.<br /><br />Steve Carrell does not try an impersonation of Don Adams, but the writers and performers do a great job of staying true to the spirit of the original while updating it in a way that our daughters, who wouldn't know Don Adams from John Quincy Adams, LIKED it.<br /><br />We liked it too. All of the "great bits" from the old series are weaved in, at least momentarily, and sometimes I was laughing at the subtle homage. But at other times the filmmakers wisely decided to put Steve Carrell in a room and turn him loose. He has a scene in an airplane lavatory with a "special" Swiss Army knife that MUST be seen, although the Mrs. recommends you not have a full bladder when you do. Another scene involving one of those movie laser security systems and a rodent had me howling. My brother and I are big fans of "Chuck Norris Jokes/Facts", and I had to call him immediately after the film to tell him he HAD to see it (after our mutual disappointment at the new Indiana Jones.)<br /><br />The plot is a skeleton on which to hang the multiple hilarious bits, but it works fairly well as a spy movie. Some of the Bond or Flint movies had plots twice as idiotic, and they weren't supposed to be comedies.<br /><br />Carrell is ably supported by Anne Hathaway as Agent 99. She has several great moments - flashing her long legs on a dance floor and saving Max from certain death in a mid-air rescue involving a parachute and a kiss.<br />Alan Arkin brings the perfect pitch to this tale as the Chief, with one foot squarely planted in the "serious spy world" of government, and the other foot ready to observe Smart's silliness.<br /><br />I was ready to laugh at a movie and this one delivered. The last time I laughed that hard in a theater was at "Anchorman".<br /><br />For fans of the old show, or simply someone who could use a good laugh.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>Before I watched this film, I read the reviews of the press and most of them weren't great. I am unfortunately one of those guys who will put himself off watching it because of those bad reviews. I'm gutted I did as this film was simply the personification of brilliance from start to finish. It's slick, stylish and downright comic excellence. Even for a film like this, the special effect and general action would put even James Bond to shame. It's exciting, quite emotional at times, cool at others and just downright silly at the times that are left.<br /><br />Steve Carell plays Maxwell Smart, a secret agent who desperately wants to get on the field. The government agency he works for known only as CONTROL are infiltrated by an evil agency known as KAOS which compromises the identities of all the current field agents. So in order to battle this force and still stay a secret, the chief of CONTROL puts smart on the field and assigns him the title of agent 86 partnering him with the much more experienced Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway). Max looks up to his close friend and one of the best agents on the field, Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson). He is the James Bond of CONTROL and it's no surprise that Max wants to be so much like him.<br /><br />This is just a really light hearted and fast paced film. I guess it could just be labelled a comedy, but that would just ignore the other great aspects of the film. The action is done really well and isn't the tacky type comedy we have come to associate comedy movies when they feature action. Some of the sequences are genuinely unique and truly edge of your seat. The chemistry between Hathaway and Carell is great and one scene in particular expresses the comedic chemistry between the two. The laser room scene which is somewhat of a clich&eacute; for spy movies is superb in this.<br /><br />Carell is the usual silly guy we have come to know and love, his ridiculous expressions and perfected comic timing are all present. It's also very pleasant to see the wonderful Anne Hathaway in a leading role where she isn't the damzel in distress, or the naive teenager. The Bill Murray cameo is also something quite special as agent 13, he's only there for a moment and has about three lines but it's always great to see Bill Murray on our screens. It also seems quite a wrestler fest as well, obviously with the inclusion of Dwayne Johnson as agent 23 but also WWEs The Great Khali as the clich&eacute; middle eastern, giant bad guy. Johnson doesn't take his character too seriously, which is something he always manages to shine in playing but manages to pull out the acting stops when he has to enter into the action man role.<br /><br />An awesome movie all round and is definitely worth it just for the sky diving scene and the laser room.</p></br><a href="../users/A81P47EIXM8HA.html">A81P47EIXM8HA</a><br/><p>Hi Folks,<br />Being a huge fan of the original I missed this in theaters due to negative reviews..it isn't as bad as they made out...and is better than  much I've wasted my money on...all that said...the SINGLE DISC version is a much better deal in my opinion..<br /><br />the 5 bonus features on the second disc of this set..all add up to about 20 minutes!! There isn't a really solid "making of" to be found in this deluxe 2 disc edition. There was no need for a second disc for this skimpy bunch of nothing. The Digital copy is truly the ONLY reason for anyone to buy this version and that is what my review is about. There are plenty of reviews of the movie..but if you don't need the digital copy ..stick with the single disc edition..this bunch of truly nothing isn't worth your money..<br />OH..I almost forgot the annoying 1st disc special feature with the bonus 62% more "laughs" ...well the reason its annoying is that you can't simply choose this version..(which wouldn't make sense anyway as many of the additional laughs were versions of scenes cut or deleted for ones in the movie so we are seeing alternative versions of funny scenes) but have to have your remote in hand and instead of an icon which shows up on screen the whole picture freezes up and shows you an image of a remote and you then hit enter and see the additional laughs (or additional attempts  at laughs)..as if you can even remember where you were in the story after all that ...over and over and over...really not a viewing  option  for anyone  who isn't overly curious to see all  the less than stellar bi-product of the production to understand  why those  "laughs" never made the movie in the first place.<br /><br />I wish I'd have saved the money and purchased the single disc version.<br />you have been warned!</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>This movie was this summer's TV rerun turned big screen flick.  I laughed.  I cringed.  I held my breath.  And, ultimately, I wished I'd listened to my two roommates who saw it opening night and hated it.  I thought it was okay, but there were other things I could have done with my time and money.<br /><br />While most people think the Communist organization KAOS died at the end of the cold war, it really went under ground.  So, too, did the US organization devoted to stopping it, CONTROL.  Maxwell Smart (Steve Carell) is their top analyst, but he secretly desires to be an agent because they get all the glory.  His idol is Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson), not only the best, but a popular nice guy.  But The Chief (Alan Arkin) won't promote Max because his extremely detailed reports are critical to the success of the agency.<br /><br />All that changes when KAOS manages to attack CONTROL's main office.  With all their agents' identities exposed, Max has to team up with Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) to discover KAOS' plan.  But Agent 99 is less than thrilled to be working with an obvious rookie who is a bit of a spaz.  Can the two stay alive long enough for CONTOL to gain ... well, control?<br /><br />Fans of the original show will see glimpses of what they loved here, including some of the outdated gadgets that were cutting edge for the 60's.  Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway do a good job of making the characters their own while also recalling the originals.  And the rest of the cast is entertaining in their parts.<br /><br />But while the original was a sitcom, this is an action comedy.  The plot was fairly predictable, but I certainly got caught up in it and was holding my breath for the climax.<br /><br />There was still humor here.  Some of Max's antics were funny, but I found too much of it stemmed from bathroom humor and sexual situations for my tastes.  These were what earned the movie its well deserved PG-13.  The funniest bits went to the two gadget geeks, Lloyd and Bruce, and the agents who were reduced to being analysts.  If the movie had had more of them, I would have enjoyed it more.<br /><br />Then there's the message the film is trying to send out.  I think it might have been trying to skewer both sides of the political spectrum.  But if that's the case, it didn't work.  Instead, I was left confused about what it was trying to say.  I've got to say, however, that one line the villain has related to all this got the loudest laugh from me.<br /><br />I wish I enjoyed all of this movie because I enjoyed most of the film.  But for me, the sex jokes and bathroom humor made me wish I hadn't seen it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>Max Smart does his job too well.  As an analyst for CONTROL, the most classified of covert counter-espionage agencies, Max delivers intelligence reports that almost nobody ever reads.  Max dreams of the day when he can join his idols, Agents 23 (Dwayne Johnson) and 99 (Ann Hathaway), but his boss decides that Max is too important to waste him in the field.<br /><br />When CONTROL's seemingly secure headquarters is attacked from within, and its roster of worldwide agents is compromised, Max is hastily promoted to "Agent" and foisted on a reluctant Agent 99.  Their mission: find the base of the likely attackers, the implacable KAOS, and destroy it.  Led by the sinister Siegfried (Terence Stamp), KAOS's attack is likely the prelude to an even wider attack.  Lacking spy-smarts, and to 99's chagrin, Max finds his training sorely inadequate to the task.<br /><br />I don't want to say any more about the movie's plot, which could have fit snugly in an episode of the show.  That said, "Get Smart" is actually a lot of fun, seldom hilarious, "Get Smart" manages to be consistently funny and entertaining.  The smooth script deftly maneuvers between newer material and the original - never losing sight of what made the old show fun while also not being enslaved by it.<br /><br />The movie's strengths are its stars - impossible to overlook how this could have been another Hollywood retread of an old TV show, it's the performances that bring "Get Smart" over the top.  Alan Arkin is great as Chief, while Stamp deserves real props for managing to be funny (rather than pathetic) playing the most serious guy in a comedy.  Best of all are Steve Carrel and Hathaway.  Carrel creates a Max that is decidedly different from Don Adams (though he does channel Adams in one extended sequence set in a hidden KAOS weapons factory, possibly as a tribute, but also to remind you how far Carrel has gone his own way).  Hathaway is surprisingly effective as 99 (at times she even sounds like Barbara Feldon), playing as the sexy counterpoint to Max's undersexed virgin spy.  Never a laugh riot, "Get Smart" supplies a steady stream of funny lines, and you'll likely be chortling about "muffins of mass destruction" long after you forgot you caught this flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TUVJBY0X4M5O.html">A1TUVJBY0X4M5O</a><br/><p>But I had just finished watching "The Dark Knight" and "Iron Man"...both of which I was disappointed in (both quite long, slow and hum-drum).  So this was a nice change of pace.<br /><br />Throughout "Get Smart", I couldn't help being reminded of the "Austin Powers" series.  How can you not?  Bumbling spy, bad guy asking for billions in ransom demand, etc.  This is nowhere as good as "Austin Powers", but there are some funny moments.<br /><br />Also a few days earlier I saw Jim Carrey's "Yes Man" in the theatre...and it was god-awful.  Really nothing much more than a chuckle in that.  This flick at least had some things going for it.  I don't think Steve Carell played it right...it was weird not having him do "the voice" from the original series.  That would have made it better for me.<br /><br />Pretty forgettable flick, but not bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>The main problem with this movie: it was'nt that funny. I think I laughed once, maybe twice. Normally, Steve Carell is very funny; but he had nothing to work with here. Terence Stamp, a great actor, is totally wasted in this punishing film as the main villian, Siegfried. Anne Hathaway was completely forgettable as, er, I forget. And someone please tell Alan Arkin to stop sleeping on the set...oh, he was awake? Could of fooled me..<br /><br />One laugh was generated by Bill Murray, playing Agent 13. Besides that, I can't think of much else that made me laugh. This was a comedy? Good points: Nice crisp,clear picture and this was a free rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WE94927YC3KI.html">A2WE94927YC3KI</a><br/><p>I like comedy movies and this movie is fun and action movie. The characters are fun. So they doing action just great. I laughing a lot. I enjoyed the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>Over the last few years with internet and chat developments, I have met many American people and discussed classic TV thousands of times... the one topic I was always surprised at was how many Americans I had talked to who had not heard of "Get Smart"...would you believe it?<br /><br />Logging into Amazon right now to see how many 5 and 4 star votes this movie has gotten, I can only come to terms that they are the ones who have no idea that this movie is based on a classic 1960's TV show. If they had have seen the original Mel Brooks creation starring Don Adams as Maxwell Smart: Secret Agent 86 (Also the voice of Inspector Gadget) and Barbra Feldon as 99, as well as all the terrific supporting roles by so many other great actors, then they would see that this movie does not hold a flame to the original series, and is almost a complete embarrassment to it.<br /><br />The 40 Year Old Virgin playing Maxwell does not portray the character of Max well. Maxwell should be sophisticated, charming, a smooth talker when he wants to be while also being a bit goofy, a stumbling klutz, and almost cartoon-like in certain ways. Steve portrays him as a geeky loser who can not produce the timing needed to pull off the classic quotes.<br /><br />Whoever is playing 99 was about the only one I think did any research on her character. She sounded a little like Barbra Feldon, and looked a little like her in ways, but she did not act like 99. She needed to lose the bitchyness and self involvement.<br /><br />The chemistry between those two characters was not there. First they hate each other, then all of a sudden Max breaks wind and she finds him charming, and suddenly they're an item? For starters, the original 99 and 86 would never insult each other, it felt too uncomfortable to see these two fighting and arguing and trying to out do each other for a better part of the movie. I know they trying to update this thing to tell the story in a modern day way, but there are some things that do not work with these well known and classic characters.<br /><br />Whoever played Siegfried almost looked the part at first, and at first I thought this evil sinister approach might be a good idea... but when he delivers a classic Siegfried line... he says it in a way that is just not humorous. Maybe they where going for it, but I think it failed.<br /><br />The Rock, Dwayne Johnson is in here as agent 23, big deal, he seemed to add little to nothing being in this movie.<br /><br />Larrabee as a bully? wt???? The Chief did not seem to be a good casting choice, the two poor attempts at geeky side-liners needed to go, and don't forget the stale as hell jokes of the fat person comedy relief gags... oh yeah, the sudden hit by a bus thing... we've seen that 1000 times already and it wasn't funny the first time. Are Hollyweed writers still on strike or something?<br /><br />What this movie needed badly was Mel Brooks. Why wasn't he asked to make this film? Go over the script, add something, just SOMETHING to this movie to improve it and make it feel like something new, with that old familiar feeling to it? Least Mel would have gotten some kind of laugh from the pathetic attempt they had at an updated "cone of silence" gag.<br /><br />On the comedy scale, I did not laugh as much as I hoped. I had a few chuckles, but nothing that I would say was hilarious or genius. And the worst part about it is, no matter how well this movie does, you can tell they have already written a sequel.. hell, there is even already a spin off available on DVD of the two geeks, and this movie isn't even on DVD yet.... gimme a break... there is no way anyone will remember the spin off to this in 2 years time.<br /><br />I have talked about all the cons so far, so can I say anything nice about the movie? A couple of things; It was good to see the original Siegfried (Bernie Kopell) get a cameo appearance in a decently thought of idea to pay homage to the original Get Smart series vehicles. Interesting to see Bill Murray trying to be funny again, and err... if I happen to think of anything else, I'll get back to you.<br /><br />Overall: Barely got to being an average movie. It's pretty much what you expect from a classic TV show to a movie, all looks, and more concern with setting up a sequel then to make a movie both old & new fans will enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A35R8PJSEURHHF.html">A35R8PJSEURHHF</a><br/><p>My personal opinion of the movie only; no comparisons will be made to the original TV series:<br /><br />This movie had some of the lamest jokes I have ever seen and heard.  Many times it appears they are making up their lines as they go, but they can't come up with anything funny.<br /><br />There are some funny scenes in the movie, not hilarious, because the scenes are not pushed far enough to make it hilarious.<br /><br />example: The dance battle between the two main characters was poorly choreographed, too slow, and not silly enough to make it funny.<br /><br />example:  Laser room scene, again not pushed far enough to make it really funny.<br /><br />example: lady in bakery coming on to the main character<br /><br />Basically that's the problem with the movie, it's just not pushed far enough to make it truly hilarious.  Most of the jokes were just lazy and come across as very cheesy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>This is one of the most insipid movies I have ever seen. After about an hour and 20 minutes I completely gave up and left the theater. Whenever I watch the old show I can't help but constantly laugh, as much as I tried to do the same with the movie I could not do so once, not once. The only remotely funny joke was the one about Max asking how to get the bad guys to take the cyanide pill he is equipped with and guess what, they took that one right out of an episode I watched a couple of months ago. The theater I saw this was fairly packed and even the usual group in the audience who'll laugh at anything was pretty silent. Instead of wasting millions of dollars the producers would have provided audiences with a much better entertainment if they had simply pasted together about 4 old episodes. It's a shame Hollywood can be so good at blowing things up but so terrible at providing laughter and excitement. And regarding Hathaway as agent 99, my only recommendation to her would be to never again in her life try comedy again, ever. It's just not for her, period. After watching Carrell as 86 I would do the same thing but I realize this is what he does for a living and he has to live off something. At any rate, something good came out of this experience. By leaving early I was able to reduce the cost of parking to the exact amount of change I was carrying. Guess things could have been worse.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Warner Brothers / A, B, C<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br />VC-1 BD-25 / Advanced Profile 3<br />Running time: 1:49:58<br />Movie size: 16,92 GB<br />Disc size: 21,76 GB<br />Average video bit rate: 16.70 Mbps<br />Number of chapters: 28<br /><br />No Lossless (HD) audio.<br /><br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  640 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  French  640 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  Portuguese  640 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  Spanish  640 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH / French / Portuguese / Spanish<br /><br />#Comedy Optimization Mode: 45 minutes of alternative jokes (HD)<br />#The Old "I Hid It in the Movie" trick - Director Peter Segal's references to the classic series revealed<br />#The Right Agent for the Right Job featurette<br />#Max in Moscow! featurette - filmed on a soundstage or on location?

Don Adams as Maxwell Smart was the perfect combination between bumbling Mel Brooks-goofiness and high security intelligence.  There have been a lot of television shows that have been made into movies (and vice versa).  Many of these are terrible.  From much of the press at the time of the movies release, one might think that the film adaptation of GET SMART starring Steve Carrell is a disaster, but it's not.  Instead, the movie stays fairly close to the original series, especially in spirit.<br /><br />In the movie, Maxwell Smart has been working for CONTROL for a number of years and longs to be a field agent like his role model, Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson).  When CONTROL headquarters is attacked, it becomes clear that the organization has been infiltrated by KAOS and that someone is a traitor working for the other side.  Most of the field agents who weren't killed in the attack are pulled and given desk jobs and Max finally gets his promotion as he's assigned to the field as Agent 86.  He's partnered with Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway), who because of recent plastic surgery remains in the field since no one knows what she looks like now.  Before leaving for the field, Max is given some top secret gizmos from his two research and development friends Bruce (Masi Oka) and Lloyd (Nate Torrence).<br /><br />Carrell and Hathaway give fine performances. They are both talented actors and there really is some zany chemistry between them on screen.  Dwayne Johnson steals many of the scenes he is in playing up to while at the same time spoofing the macho leading man roles he often is given.<br />Bill Murray has a very small cameo as Agent 13, so watch for that.  Also, many of the original devices and gags from the original series feature in the movie such as the cone of silence and the shoe-phone.<br /><br />I enjoyed GET SMART.  I thought it was funny, with just the right amount of action and plenty of heart.  Though it's not quite as good as the original tv show, it as a great film adaptation of an original tv show that only misses the mark "by that much".</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>Steve Carrell and Anne Hathaway are perfect in their roles as Maxwell Smart and Agent 99 in the movie version of "Get Smart". This movie is the perfect combination of action and comedy without being too cheesy. I enjoyed the special effects and storyline as well. I felt the acting was great by all cast members as well! My hubby was a huge fan of the "Get Smart" television series and he felt that the movie was the modern version of "Get Smart".</p></br><a href="../users/A25QJBK33C4O0R.html">A25QJBK33C4O0R</a><br/><p>I've seen the theatrical version of this film twice.  Once when it was in first run, and again now on Blu-ray.  To be blunt, I thought the film was ok when it was in first run, but wasn't impressed enough with it to want to see it again.  It was and is ok in my book, but I felt it lacked somewhat, at least when compared to my memories of the original TV series.<br /><br />Ah, the TV series.  Total camp, but fun at the same time.  Loved by enough viewers that I can see why it would seem to be a target to mine on the bigger screen, especially with someone like Steve Carell in the lead. Carell makes a good Maxwell Smart, and if the story were better, I think this one could have been a genuine 5 star hit.  Unfortunately, as others have said here, it missed it by that much :-(<br /><br />Anne Hathaway is ok in taking over the Barbara Feldon role, and Alan Arkin isn't bad as the chief.  Honestly none of the performances are disappointing to me, it's just that the story itself, at least from the theatrical version isn't as funny as it should be.<br /><br />Which brings me back to the 62% more laughs that are promised in the Blu-ray.  Ah, more laughs from promised bonus scenes actually sounds good and enticed me to give the Blu-ray a try, but ... the presentation is just so disappointing to me that I have got to slam it in this review.<br /><br />Offering up a director's cut or extended cut version of a film is something that I greatly appreciate, but if you are going to do it, by all that is right in the universe please do it in a way that respects the viewer and not as done here.<br /><br />Seamless branching has been around in the DVD format for a while and it's used here, but isn't even close to being seamless.  Far from it, it seems that if you turn on the bonus scene viewing version of the film you get a neat little icon of Maxwell Smart in the phone booth (or at least of the phone booth) to indicate that bonus materials are now being shown.  That's not bad but... the icon is much larger than it needs to be and obliterates part of the screen when it needn't have been so intrustive.  Even looking past that there's a greater annoyance -- when the bonus scenes are accessed there's an annoying pause present, at least when played on my PS3.  Just enough of a pause that you'll find yourself highly annoyed and will probably want to turn off the bonus scene feature asap.<br /><br />Sadly, from a cursory glance at the menus, there doesn't seem to be a way to just play the bonus scenes.  Instead you must access them in place.  I could be missing something obvious there, but then again, if it was obvious I don't think I would have missed it.<br /><br />So, to summarize, there's a disappointing story (at least in the theatrical version) that doesn't get the best from the talent on hand, and an even more disappointing presentation of the bonus scenes that make the experience less satisfying than it should be.  Missed it by that much indeed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>From all the negative reviews of this movie, you'd think the title was "Get Dumb!" But as a long time fan of the original, I enjoyed it. I thought the movie stayed close enough to the original concept and that the actors were all good enough so that the movie was an overall enjoyable flick.<br /><br />Ann Hathaway and Steve Carrell aren't quite as wacky as the originals, but then who is? Don Adams had a quality of goofy exaperatedness which is hard to imitate, but Carrell is still good in his own inimitable way. I thought they both did a decent job with their roles. Terrence Stamp, Bill Murray, and Alan Arkin, were all good as I would expect, and The Rock was better than I expected and in some ways stole the show.<br /><br />The movie reprises many gags from the original, such as the cone of silence, the shoe/radio, the line "Missed it by that much!" and few others, and I thought those came off well too. Overall, I thought this was, although perhaps not great, still a good reprisal of the original show for an old, somewhat persnickety fan of the original series.</p></br><a href="../users/A239PPUVV8O0U0.html">A239PPUVV8O0U0</a><br/><p>Yay! My 100th review. Now that that's done; I couldn't imagine Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway in an action film but they pulled it off well. Nobody can top what Adams, Feldon, Platt, Kopell, etc. did in the series and the actors in this don't rip off their interpretations or belittle what they had done. Carell plays Max with a deadpan wit, which I enjoy, compared to Adams' nasily voice which defined the character back in the 60s and it still does now. Hathaway is the accomplished agent who doesn't even tolerate Max until the end while Feldon immediately fell in love with him. Platt's Chief grew exasperated with Max's antics while Arkin's actually admired Max's talent. And Kopell (who makes a cameo) used a thick German accent while Terence Stamp is an English actor who plays Seigfreid with a bit more menace. The references to the series are excellent from Max's catchphrase to the shoe-phone. Even the three cars Adams drove in the opening credits are featured. The plot is a little cliched (drawing comparisons from how Steve Martin's Clouseau gets humiliated only to be redeemed in the end) and some twists aren't that surprising but it doesn't stop this from being funny and exciting. The gags and jokes are clever (this being one of few comedies I've seen in theatres and the whole audience was laughing) but the vomit joke was disgusting and not remotely funny. The action sequences were executed well, some scenes being homages to the Bond films (the original series being a spoof of them) such as the free fall fight sequence with Dalip (who reminds me a little of Richard Keil's Jaws and Kabir Bedi's Gobinda) from Moonraker. Trevor Rabin's score is excellent and I love the reorchestrated TV theme.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>Steve Carrell was an excellent choice to play Maxwell Smart, the production is first rate, and the rest of the cast is very good...but I kept wanting more spoof and less spying.  There were too many moments when the story played its intrigue story straight at the expense of the comedy (that and Mike Meyers' limited sex and fart jokes killed the Austin Powers films).<br /><br />Still, some good moments, very well made (it looks good enough to actually be a glossy spy film!), I just wish it had more humor in it.  Either way, it's entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>I'm a big fan of the original series. It had it all: comedy, romance, political satire, physical comedy and action. The humor was both broad and subtle. The movie captured the broad strokes, but missed the subtle humor. Carrel made the role his own and was very good. Hathaway as 99 worked pretty well. Arkin's role as the chief was good. The physical comedy was good. The romance worked. The relationship between Max and the chief worked. The cone of silence and the other gadgets were excellent. Some of the scenes fell flat. The homage to the car and the shoe phone of the original show was good.<br /><br />In summary, the movie was good. It missed some of the political satire and subtle humor of the original show, but for a movie made from a TV series it was very good. My wife and I laughed a lot, which is the major test of a movie like this.</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>Actually, by quite a lot.  GET SMART, the movie remake of the 1960s hit comedy series of the same name, is in no way true to the spirit of Maxwell Smart.  The original series was cute, warm, and wacky; a patriotic slap-stick comedy.  The modern day movie, GET SMART, isn't even a parody of the TV series; rather, it is a very pale and hollow interpretation of an American institution.<br /><br />Neither my husband nor I found the movie version of GET SMART to be funny.  There were maybe two spots where we actually laughed (and hence, two stars instead of one); however, most of the time, we never even smiled.  Where the original was clever and quirky, the movie is banal and pedestrian, relying on too many insipid off color or fat jokes instead of real humor.  Where the first Agent 99 truly cared about Agent 86, from the first time she met him, this Agent 99 can't stand Max and he has to fight to win her approval.  Where the original Max was bumbling and lovable, this Max is clumsy, off-putting, and very dull.<br /><br />There are times when a "stupid movie" can be really fun.  In this case, the stupid movie, GET SMART, is just plain stupid.  There is almost nothing to recommend GET SMART.  Especially since the villain is clearly telegraphed from the beginning.  We definitely will not be watching this movie again.  What a disappointment.  It could have been a movie worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A4X7NFDO3I1TA.html">A4X7NFDO3I1TA</a><br/><p>Get Smart is funny! It is about a spy named Maxwell Smart. This is a great movie. I would recommend it to anyone who like comedies.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>This movie is incredibly funny, and a great tribute to the classic series, in which it is based on. Steve Carell is awesome and hilarious as Maxwell Smart, who works as an analyst for the top secret American intelligence agency, CONTROL. Max wishes to be a field agent. When Max passes his test, the Chief of CONTROL feels that Max's analytical skills are too valuable. When CONTROL is attacked, the chief decides to make Max an agent. His partner is Agent 99, played by the incredibly beautiful Anne Hathaway. Agent 99 does not want to work with Max because she sees him as irritating. The more they work together, the more they like each other. They must stop a man named Siegfried, who plants a bomb at a concert. To make matters worse, Max is accused of being a double agent. He tries to break out, and try to stop the bomb from going off, and save Agent 99 from the 'real' double agent. This movie is filled to the brim with action, and comedy! I highly recommend that you GET SMART!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>This review is for the Get Smart Full-Screen edition that came with the Invisble Ink Spy Pen with Ultraviolet Decoder Light in the package.

It was retitled and edited for television as "The Return of Maxwell Smart".<br />  Don Adams and Barbara Feldon reteamed for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JMKJSC">Get Smart Again</a> (1989-tvm) with Dick Gautier returning as "Hymie".<br />  Don and Barbara reteamed again for the FOX tv series, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001666484">Get Smart: The Complete Series</a> in 1995.<br />  Don Adams passed away September 25, 2005 of Pulmonery Infection.<br /><br />  For this motion picture reboot of "Get Smart", Steve Carell is Agent 86 with Anne Hathaway (Princess Diaries (2001), Princess Diaries 2 (2004)) as Agent 99.<br />  Alan Arkin as "The Chief", Terence Stamp as "Siegfried" David Koechner as "Larabee", Bill Murray as "Agent 13", Patrick Warburtun as "Hymie".<br />  Only Bernie Kopell, who appeared 14 times as "Siegfried" in the original "Get Smart" tv series, makes an all too brief cameo appearance.<br />  For die hard fans of the tv series, this movie will be a hard pill to swallow.  Steve Carell does not have the voice or the characture that Don Adams add made famous.<br />  28 minutes into the film, I could not stand it anymore. I turned it off and went to bed.<br />  I decided to give it another try 2 weeks later. I liked Anne Hathaway in the strong character and it was nice to see the likeable Alan Arkin in a movie again.<br />  It was Dalip Singh who was a scene stealer in this film. I really took notice. I had not seen him before this film, but I found out he has been the wrestler, The Great Khali.  Pardon me for saying this, but Mr. Singh reminded me of Richard Kiel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VZPQFI">Eegah (1962)</a>,who played "Jaws" in the 2 "James Bond" films, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M53GN6">The Spy Who Loved Me</a>(1977), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIBURG">Moonraker</a>(1979).<br /><br />Also in the cast: Dwayne Johnson, James Caan, Ken Davitian, Larry Miller, Kevin Nealon.<br /><br />  Why didn't they have Bernie Kopell play "Siegfried" in this film?<br /><br />  Masi Oka and Nate Torrence ( Nate, whom you have seen in many tv commercials) who play Bruce & Lloyd in this "Get Smart" film, continued their roles in a made-for-DVD movie sequel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018O4SOQ">Get Smart's Bruce and Lloyd Out of Control</a> (2008)",  released just 10 days after "Get Smart" was released in the movie theatre.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I thought this movie was pretty funny. I was a fan of the origional Get Smart and loved Max and 99 back in the day. This movie is a good companion piece of that show and holds up on its own. I also like that Max wasn't portrayed as a Xerox copy of the Don Adams Maxwell Smart. Ann Hathaway is also really good as 99 but portrays her as more of a tough as nails hardcore kick butt sexy agent. The Rock is pretty good but nothing great. I also am a huge Alan Arkin fan and thought he did a good job. Also the little tribute to Hyme was a nice touch.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>No one expects "Get Smart" to be anything more than a humorous bit of fluff riffing on James Bond and other super spies.  In brining a 40 year old TV show to the big screen, the powers that be brought Agents 86 and 99 into the modern era and gave them more detailed treatment.  Steve Carell brings back the kind of playing it straight humor that Don Adams did so well.  Maxwell Smart is a terrific analyst who has worked like crazy to become a field agent, but has been kept from it for a variety of reasons, not the least is his superb ability as an analyst.  Ann Hatheway is a modern woman and is more disinterested in 86 than Barbara Feldon's version ever was.  Terrence Stamp is a positively diabolical Siegfried and the humor associated with him happens around him (mostly).  Bernie Kopell's Siegfried was written with a touch of villainy and a lot more humor.  However, putting together a feature film requires more substance for a story than a half-hour sitcom.  (Kopell does make a cameo appearance so watch for him!).<br /><br />The plot of the story matters little except for the jokes it helps to set up.  That was the point of the TV show, too.  Alan Arkin is quite good as Chief and the rest of the cast does their work with a nice touch.  Dwayne Johnson pulls of the ultimate Agent 23 deftly.  I also enjoyed Masi Oka and Nate Torrence as Bruce and Lloyd.  Their line about getting the super strong thread by milking spiders is unforgettable.  Bill Murray has a nice cameo as Agent 13 that is a wonderful homage to the original show.<br /><br />You can also watch the movie in "comedy enhancement mode" were the alternate lines not used in the film are provided.  Some are funny, many are not.  I saw why most were not in the movie although I enjoyed the lines about the viola.<br /><br />Anyway, cotton candy is fun to eat in the way this movie is fun to watch.  Maybe we can get another one with more of Bruce and Lloyd and Hymie (Patrick Warburton).  Yes, I saw the straight to DVD story they did with those two, but I would like something that actually works better than that little thing.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>I was somewhat hesitant to take the time to watch the '08 remake of the 60's comedy television series `Get Smart'. To be honest, I wasn't a big fan of the show growing up even though I watched it (there wasn't a lot to choice from back then). With that in mind I wondered if I really wanted to listen to all the rehashed lines and view all the 60's comedy routines that the 60's television series was known for. However I do enjoy Steve Carell and Dwayne "the Rock"  Johnson so I decided to go ahead and spend the quality time with my wife and daughter and take the chance.<br /><br />I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised with what I saw. While the film remained true to the spirit of the original series there was more than enough original thinking infused into the movie to allow the film to be enjoyed on its own merit without being nothing more than a tribute piece of cinema. There were loads of laughs, some superior physical comedy sequences (love the dance-off), smart dialogue (yes, I said smart) and consistent energy from beginning to end.  Maybe it's not destined to be a classic, but certainly a film the whole family can enjoy.<br /><br />My Rating: -3 ? Stars-.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW.html">A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW</a><br/><p>Tired of just dealing with paperwork, analyzing intelligence information and being behind the scenes, Analyst Maxwell Smart wants nothing more than to become a Special Agent. And the "Chief" gives him his opportunity when Kaos starts systematically killing Control agents, revealing their identities placing them in danger all over the world. Newly promoted Special Agent 86 (Maxwell Smart), along with his capable partner, the very pretty "Agent 99" (Anna Hathaway) and his trusted and very sexy friend "Agent 23" (Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson) set out to save the world. Faced with danger and adventure, Smart proves that he is more than an analyst, but a secret agent to be reckoned with.<br /><br />This movie was extremely entertaining and funny. There were scenes that simply made me laugh out loud (the laser room, skydiving, throwing up in the face piece, or even "The Rock" running into a wall), and Steve Carell made a wonderful Maxwell Smart. And I even think that "The Rock" has a future in comedy. He is showing that he is a well rounded actor. Comedy, romance, drama and action adventure. With all that being said, I enjoyed this movie and think you will too.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>I have heard some complain this isn't as good as the original. Sounds like sour grapes to me. I watched the original some forty years ago. It was way overdo time for a movie. This movie is great in my humble opinion. The casting, directing, sets, F/X, and music all make a funny type Bond movie. Steve Carell, Terence Stamp, and Alan Arkan stand out, but everyone did a great job. Carell as Agent 86 and Anne Hathaway as Agent 99 team up to stop K.A.O.S. from unleashing a nuclear bomb. Maxwell Smart has been a reliable office agent for some time and even when he passes his field agent test the Chief, played by Alan Arkan, does not want him to go to the field because of his expertise with tracking people while at C.O.N.T.R.O.L. headquarters. All-in-all a fun movie for the whole family. Fans of Saturday Night Live should definitely catch it. I give it three and a half stars. Good DVD quality and plenty of replayability. Extras are based on the single or double disc versions. If you enjoyed this catch "Galaxy Quest".<br /><br />CA Luster</p></br><a href="../users/A15TNUM2PBS6F0.html">A15TNUM2PBS6F0</a><br/><p>I remember watching the old t.v. show version of "Get Smart" in reruns as a kid and laughing my head off.  I didn't do it with the movie, but it did get a few chuckles out of me. You can thank the comedy genius known as Steve Carrell for that.  He plays Maxwell Smart.  Like most t.v. shows turned to movies, the movie verion of "Get Smart" isn't that good, but I still laughed quite a bit, mostly during the bits Steve Carrell had.<br />Agent 99 was played by Anne Hathaway who merely impresses me. She isn't an actress I generally watch films of. She is ok, but she doesn't hold a candle anywhere near Barbara Feldon's 99.  Okay, I'll stop comparing the two now.<br />The film also stars Alan Arkin as the Chief(who is actually pretty good in this movie, he does comedy well), Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock as Agent 23, Terrence Stamp as the bad guy, Siegfried, and Bill Murray has one scene he is in as one of the other agents.<br />This is worth renting if you like Carrell's work, if you are a big fan of the show, rent or buy the episodes instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>I was a fan of the old TV show<br />and this movies does that no harm!<br />I'm also a big Anne Hathaway fan and she pulls off<br />the comedy acting well.<br />With the Bush administration making the spy business a bad word,<br />it is refreshing to see something "fresh" if it is a revival.<br />The latest Bond movie is a real sell out!<br />Most of the jokes were is good taste,<br />unlike another spoof spy movie that it on three remakes.<br />I was just thinking about buying the TV series DVD for someone in the family for Christmas.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ADUOVTY3TIRU.html">A3ADUOVTY3TIRU</a><br/><p>I'm a big fan of the original series.I expected a very good movie here.I thought they had found a good character to play Maxwell Smart in Steve Carell.But i think the script itself was a bit lacking something.Also it was annoying to see other people play the parts of the original characters who did not resemble them one iota.It seemed they were trying a modern approach,that to me simply didn't work.I started off enjoying it but half an hour or so into it, i was beggining to wonder.I wouldn't say i hated it,but at the same time i don't think i would watch it again for a while.</p></br><a href="../users/ATHTCOG6BB6WK.html">ATHTCOG6BB6WK</a><br/><p>Get Smart is a well done remake of the show made into a feature film. The cast is well chosen for their roles and it's a laugh a minute. Maxwell Smart and the more experienced field agent, Agent 99, go on a mission to Russia to find a bakery that specializes in yellow cake uranium. The over-sized KAOS agent, like Jaws from James Bond, is out to stop them.

Well, all the slapstick, goofy stuff, and Maxwell Smart's egotistical pettiness are there, but they've been through the "sensitive male" 1980s, Jenny Craig, high-budget effects and stunts, and I don't know what-all. Going through all that transformed them.<br /><br />I almost split a gut laughing when the discussion turned to the state of her ovaries (Hathaway is a young-looking 26 as of this writing, a fact that needs a little explaining away in the movie, and I assume that they're just fine). Then, when the big, knockdown fight near the end turned into a hugfest, well that was way too Californian for me even though I'm Californian - but only a little, and that will get better real soon I promise.<br /><br />It was all I remembered, but more in every direction - including some mild potty humor and silly edges toward nudity that would never have worked back when the good guys could still smoke. Enough time has passed, and they acknowledge that from the start, that it can all be new again. And it's a hoot.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>Get Smart is based on the classic 1960s sitcom starring Don Adams as Maxwell Smart and Barbara Feldon as agent 99. In the movie Steve Carrell as Smart is Control's top analyst but he wants to be an agent. He finally gets his chance when Control agents all over the world are attacked at once by KAOS and they are left short handed. So agent 86 goes on his first mission with agent 99 played by Ann Hathaway.<br /><br />The cast play their parts with verve and their are several laugh out loud moments in the movie, but it doesn't sustain the laughs throughout. People who didn't watch the TV show may like it more. I loved the old show and found the differences off-putting. Don Adams played Smart with a bumbling arrogance. Carrell is a brilliant comedic actor but he played Smart so straight he had almost no personality. Barbara Feldon's 99 was smart and confident but also vulnerable. Hathaway's 99 was self-centered and abrasive at times. Get Smart is a funny movie but not a classic like the TV show.</p></br><a href="../users/APBB297H3ZA5E.html">APBB297H3ZA5E</a><br/><p>1.  I like Steve Carrell, but just based on the trailers, I thought this movie was going to be a little too silly or dumb in its humor.<br /><br />2.  Bottomline:  a great cast of characters, well acted, good story line and smart / funny humor.  Well done.</p></br><a href="../users/A25UZ7MA72SMKM.html">A25UZ7MA72SMKM</a><br/><p>Although Get Smart has plenty of easy laughs in it, there are many places where the laughs are rather subtle and you have to both be paying attention and get what they are spoofing. Those laughs are probably the biggest if you spot them.<br /><br />What can you say about Steve Carell? In remakes of this type it is easy for the movie actor to come up short of the legend created out of the popular TV role. (Will Smith as James West anyone?) As much as I enjoyed Don Adams in the TV series, Steve Carell one up's him and is a better Maxwell Smart than Adams was.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway obviously studied Barbara Feldon's Agent 99 quite a bit, because there are lines in the movie where you could swear that a younger Feldon had been plugged in. She's spot on in the role.<br /><br />The movie pays homage to Don Adam's most famous repeat bits without overdoing it one bit. The story is engaging, and the action is very well done, although you'll struggle to recognize that because they don't let up on the comedy accelerator even in the middle of action scenes that would be the most tense in any other film.<br /><br />The Blu-ray redition of the film is a delight to watch. I don't go through special features often, so I won't comment on those, altho we did watch the outtake/gag reel and it was worth the time spent to watch it ... twice.<br /><br />We have now watched this film several times as we played it for ourselves, and then various sets of family and friends. We enjoy it just as much with each repeated viewing ... a solid accomplishment for any film, and even more so for a comedy.<br /><br />Obviously, if you like comedies this is highly recommeneded. If you were a fan of the Get Smart TV series, its must see.</p></br></body></html>

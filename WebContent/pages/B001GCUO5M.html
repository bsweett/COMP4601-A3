Reading it in plain text may not sound that cool, but try saying it out-loud with a Boston accent and a rough attitude. Leonardo DiCaprio does in Shutter Island, and it sounds wicked-awesome!<br /><br />DiCaprio plays Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels. His sidekick of a partner is Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), and they are sent to the mysterious `Shutter Island' to investigate the disappearance of a woman.<br /><br />After she drowned her three children in the lake behind her house, Rachel (Emily Mortimer) was sent to this eerie island. It's an insane asylum for the kind of insane people that we love the most in dark and gritty films similar to this; the criminal kind. When she miraculously escapes from her cell, with a barred window and a sealed door locked from the outside; it's up to Teddy and Chuck to track her down. With a horrific storm on the horizon, they don't have much time and chances don't look too bright that she will survive. As if matters aren't bad enough on their own, Teddy is suffering from severe post traumatic stress from his involvement in World War II.<br /><br />The island is very much a huge character in the film. It's comparable to the islands of Deep Rising, King Kong and The Lost World: Jurassic Park. Shutter Island's legendary director, Martin Scorsese, brilliantly introduces the island to us early on in the film. It's massive in size and lurks in its murky waters, surrounded by a heavy thick `turn back now!' fog. It's introduced to us via creepy boat ride and is accompanied by a daunting score, every bit as chilling as those of The Shining and Jaws.<br /><br />As he has for years, Scorsese knows exactly what he's doing with the camera. He captures chilling images that pay homage to Stanley Kubrick and Alfred Hitchcock.<br /><br />The film constantly gets under your skin and makes you repeatedly ask yourself, "What the hell is going on?" It's not hard to follow; it's just bizarre and unsettling. It's no secret that weird things start happening; even if you haven't seen the trailer, you are almost suffocated with this constant vibe from the first scene to the last.<br /><br />The ending is the pay-off. I'm not going to say that the movie is too long, or that it's boring, because it's not in the least. But it is long and you are literally drained by the end of it. It just takes so much out of you. You're left with island fever I guess, and Scorsese has ensured that his island has bogged you down, along with his characters.<br /><br />The film takes us back to the 50s which is always a blast. It's creepy and disturbing but not over the top with the gore. It's cleverly written and I'm sure the novel of which it's based, has sent one or two of its readers to the Looney-bin. It's a fun ride and while it embodies several different elements we've seen a thousand times before (eerie island, insane asylum, post World War II, where'd the girl go? etc.); it boils all of them in a pot together, creating something very unique indeed. The film will surely only get better and better with repeated viewings.<br /><br />The acting is superb, and now that I think about it, the film is also resembles a videogame; Resident Evil, Tomb Raider and Silent Hill come to mind. There are several powerful characters that Teddy visits on his journey, that give him advice or a piece to his puzzle. Ben Kingsley is terrific as the doctor. Mark Ruffalo is very much like a videogame sidekick and you believe he'd do anything at all for Teddy. And Jackie Earle Haley and Elias Koteas play a couple of the island's mentally tormented misfits, astonishingly well. Jackie Earle Haley can be jotted down as a candidate for an Academy Award in the supporting actor category; a flawless performance.<br /><br />Having worked together on Gangs of New York, Aviator, The Departed and now Shutter Island; it's clear that DiCaprio and Scorsese know exactly what they will get from one another. It's pure movie magic as far as I'm concerned; they make one of the best Hollywood duos out there.<br /><br />Here's the first of the potential Oscar candidates for 2010.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Shutter Island marks the fourth collaboration between director Martin Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. The film is Scorsese's follow-up to his Best Picture-winning The Departed and is adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane, whose novel Mystic River was the basis for the terrific Clint Eastwood film. Shutter Island is a different breed of film from both that film and previous Scorsese films. As a director who has been working since the 1960s, you wouldn't expect him to have anything new to offer as a filmmaker, and you would be wrong. Shutter Island is a psychological horror film with shades of similarities to films like Secret Window and The Game (story-wise; specifically in the conclusion), but it's the way Scorsese handles the material rather than the material itself that makes it as good as it is. Shutter Island has beautiful cinematography, lovely art direction, and a haunting score...It's not the story that stays with you as much as the atmosphere.<br /><br />DiCaprio (who is in every scene) plays Edward "Teddy" Daniels, a U.S. Marshal from Boston circa 1954, who is sent to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a patient at Shutter Island's asylum for the criminally insane. With his new partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) in tow, Teddy is immediately baffled by the woman's disappearance and suspicious of the ominous doctors (Ben Kingsley & Max Von Sydow) who run the asylum. Haunted by dreams of his dead wife (Michelle Williams) and his time in the war; Teddy slowly unravels the mystery housed at Shutter Island with shocking, albeit semi-predictable results.<br /><br />I've compared the film to Secret Window and The Game, but this comparison is a reflection of various parts of the plot. As a film, it's much more reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining and Lars von Trier's Antichrist sans the sexual mutilation. The cinematography led me to specifically recall Antichrist as both films share a similar artful quality and creativity in the area. There are scenes in Shutter Island that are breathtakingly beautiful, some even capturing that beauty in the grotesque and horrifying. As for the comparison to The Shining, Scorsese has made a film that is so atmospheric, it draws you into both the setting and the mystery of the film in the way The Shining did. To say this film evokes Kubrick is an understatement; it's the closest thing I've seen to a Kubrick film since Kubrick died and I doubt Scorsese would deny that influence.<br /><br />As you could expect from a Scorsese film, it's filled with terrific actors giving terrific performances but it's DiCaprio who carries the film. DiCaprio is a misunderstood actor, equally loved and hated by moviegoers/critics. Some think he's wooden, incapable of evoking any real emotion while some see him as one of the greatest working actors. This performance should sway some of his naysayers, as DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Teddy. This is a complicated character, with many dimensions to him and DiCaprio embodies those dimensions perfectly with plenty of nuance. The supporting players are all perfectly cast as well, sometimes making quite an impression with only a single scene, such as the terrific Jackie Earle Haley.<br /><br />Certainly some will find it slow-moving (although at 138 minutes, it never feels long) and even more will see the long-winded ending as a bit of a cop out. I wasn't disappointed by the ending due to the inclusion of the haunting scene at the Lake House and Scorsese leaving his audience with just a little bit of ambiguity. This is a terrific film Scorsese has made here. It's a horror film of the sort that isn't made anymore; an intelligent horror film for intelligent people. It's the first great film of 2010, proof that DiCaprio and Scorsese bring out something special and powerful in each other. Its imagery and memorable musical score only get richer with a second viewing. Don't miss this film.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>I'd have to see "Shutter Island" again to really gage whether it is above or below Scorsese's potential--my original viewing of "The Departed" was quick, rushed, and though I recognized it was above average, I made the mistake of not realizing how intricate and masterfully crafted it really was.  A long standing Martin Scorsese fan, I think his hardcore fans must have the feeling that the man's mind is moving in darker and darker avenues these days.  Though the end of this one is a little less "doom wins" then "Departed", it echoes a similar sentiment: mankind can never really grasp truth, and oftentimes lives in elaborately constructed avenues of corruption rather than facing the truth and dealing with it. Scorsese's grip on his Catholicsm has become tenuous at best.<br /><br />There are questions Scorsese deliberately evades to make us wonder a bit more.  What was in the cigarettes so generously passed out in the asylum?  Why are Max Von Sydow (echoing Dr. Mengele and the Nazi threat) and Ben Kingsley (with plans that may be real? for an unethical "energy treatment" of the mentally ill, echoing the A Bomb) conducting such a ridiculously lengthy experiment on this patient in particular?  How did they know a storm would take place before the "ferry" left?  Is the director also making a negative comment on the advent of psychotropic drugs, hospitals, etc before they were thoroughly developed and maximized by the state?<br /><br />The revelation about Teddy Daniels at the end of the film did not at all surprise or shock me.  There were times--for instance, when Daniels is questioning a "patient" about her role in the disappearance of a fictitious child murderer--where it seems as though David Lynch had stepped in to Scorsese's shoes to say: "Everyone's insane!"  The flashbacks to the concentration camps were so disturbingly effective that I'd put them on par with quite a few quality holocaust films, though of course it isn't *just* about his experiences at the camps.  Mahler blasts, roses fall, SS officers die, and Teddy winds his way through a psychological maze right to his own--also uncertain and vague--ending.  Why would a guy who shot someone under those particular circumstances consider himself a complete, unredeemable monster?  That was my main foible with the film--Teddy loathes himself *that much* for snapping when his children have just been drowned, etc?  His crime was capital, of course, but anyone could have argued for an insanity plea.  Indeed they could have.<br /><br />But this only points to the moral heart of the story.  We do not know everything, we cannot know everything, and some ideas of right and wrong, what we have or haven't done, can never be clearly and crisply answered.  This is the darkest Martin Scorsese movie I have ever seen--it is to his film canon what "Hour of the Wolf" was to Bergman's: a thorough exploration of the artists' subconscious.  While I won't say at all that this matches up to "The Departed", it is certainly one of Scorsese's more vulnerable films and not to be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>There are in this world mental institutions that are brightly lit, orderly and clean. These places are filled with disturbed patients, and an overworked, but determined, staff of orderlies, doctors and nurses who all do their best to help the people under their care. They are kind and do everything they can to improve the lives of their patients in the hope that some day these sad people might be released.<br /><br />You will never see one of these places in a movie.<br /><br />The asylum in Shutter Island, the latest film from famed director Martin Scorsese, is a dark, sullen place. It is filled with shadows and dripping water and fading light. The staff is occasionally helpful, but mostly obstructionist and occasionally downright dangerous. This is the movie asylum taken to the nth degree.<br /><br />To this asylum arrives Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio), a US Marshall investigating a locked-room mystery where, somehow, a patient, who was in there for killing her three children, has managed to escape. With his newly-assigned partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), he meets the deputy warden (John Carrol Lynch), who, as usual in these pieces, explains the rules of the asylum, takes their guns and shows them inside.<br /><br />Once inside they meet Dr John Cawley (Ben Kingsley, in his best role in ages), as well as a German, one Dr Naehring (Max von Sydow). Daniels doesn't trust the German, and hasn't exactly had a warm spot in his heart for any Germans since he was part of the squad that liberated Dachau.<br /><br />From there things get strange. A storm lashes the island. The missing woman turns up. Someone else goes missing. Memories get confused and Teddy's ability to tell reality from fiction starts to fade rapidly, bringing up the question of how contagious insanity might be.<br /><br />This is a very good film. It's not Scorsese's best, but it's easily up there with The Aviator and is better than Gangs of New York. True, he's not at the top of his form, but his second-best is still better than most director's mangum opuses (opii?).<br /><br />The acting, especially by DiCaprio and Kingsley, is truly top notch. The cinematography and sets are nicely creepy without being too overwhelming. The ending is perhaps a bit muddled and might take a couple viewings to make sense, but this is a film that's worth seeing again and again. It is easily the best film of 2010, at least so far.<br /><br />From the trailer you'd think this was a creepy, nearly supernatural thriller, but it's much better than that. It's a voyage into the mind and to a place where you really, really hope that all your dreams don't ever come true.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DDPQ9342UNMY.html">A3DDPQ9342UNMY</a><br/><p>Relax. This review won't give away the ending which comes as somewhat of a surprise, although many will admit to guessing the overall situation pretty early on.<br /><br />If you like your mysteries drenched in atmospheric surroundings, look no further than SHUTTER ISLAND. Director Martin Scorsese starts out with murky skies and a foreboding of doom as two men (a sheriff and his partner) approach a rocky coastline on a ferry as an ominous looking island looms into view. The plot, although keeping the viewer in a sea of confusion as it unravels, only becomes clear toward the last thirty minutes--but until then, the less you know about the outcome, the more you will enjoy the satisfying ending.<br /><br />None of the exposition is direct. Instead, we see the story from the viewpoint of a man (LEONARDO DiCAPRIO) who is obviously very troubled about tragic incidents in his past and who only gradually begins to see things in a different light. His journey is compelling right from the start, thanks to the marvelous performances of DiCaprio and MARK RUFFALO who begin their investigation into happenings at the island housing the mentally insane--some of them very dangerous cases.<br /><br />Director Martin Scorsese has the benefit of an excellent cinematographer, ROBERT RICHARDSON, whose camera work makes every frame of the film captivating. All of the exterior scenes along the rocky coastline of Maine have a sinister look. The story is told in a leisurely way but there is always an air of mystery in the relationships between the main characters, including BEN KINGSLEY as the psychiatrist in charge of the institution and MAX VON SYDOW as a suspicious looking German doctor.<br /><br />It's best not to dwell on the final outcome--but let's just say it probably won't come as a complete surprise to everyone. Nevertheless, it's the sort of thinking man's psychological thriller that any mystery fan should be able to savor.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Sometimes, schlock borders on art.  In the hands of Martin Scorsese, it not only becomes art--it becomes a whole new kind of art entirely.  SHUTTER ISLAND is equal parts thriller, noir, mystery, and horror, a darkly humorous and atmospheric film filled some outstanding acting and truly stunning visuals.<br /><br />The film revolves around a very simple premise: U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and his partner (Ruffalo) are going to Ashecliffe Island on Shutter Island, outside Boston, to look for a missing inmate.  She hasn't escaped: she's on the island somewhere.  But where?  And what exactly goes on at Ashecliffe, what mysterious activities have really drawn Daniels there?  And the ultimate question: will he escape with his sanity?<br /><br />The film is very closely based on Dennis Lehane's spectacular novel, with a few minor twists (and one not-so-minor twist near the end).  DiCaprio is a wonder in the lead role; he has really grown into his own as an actor, and this film gives him a breadth of range he hasn't yet seen before.  As for the rest of the principle cast: Ruffalo is in traditionally fine form; it's nice to see Ben Kingsly actually acting again (as opposed to just treading water in a bunch of slop); Michelle Williams is amazing as Daniels's deceased wife (viewed in flashbacks/hallucinations); Max von Sydow is chilling (if underused); Emily Mortimer turns in a haunting performance in her limited role; John Carroll Lynch doesn't have much to do, but does it well; and Jackie Earl Healey, in his small role, is fantastic.<br /><br />The level of the performances, and the solid script by Laeta Kalogridis, aside, the reason to view this film--repeatedly--is for Scorsese's atmospheric directing.  Remember CAPE FEAR, his slight misfire of a horror film (though still far better than most horror films of the 90s)?  SHUTTER ISLAND doesn't misfire, not once.  And it's filled with some absolutely stellar visual shots, scenes and imagery that borders on performance art.  Haunting in its breadth and emotional resonance, SHUTTER ISLAND ranks among Scorsese's best.  Watch it to see what a noir/horror film should be.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>"Shutter island" is the first largo in which Scorsese deals with a dark, sinister and at first sight a terror film. But, at second sight, the movie is a merciless metaphor that emblematizes the dark years after the WW2. it's not a mere coincidence the arouse of the Noir genre began precisely since 1946, in which the ghosts, phantoms and dragons nestled during these oppressing years got out from the Pandora' box. The dark experiments about genetics well known during the Nazi Germany (Do you remember QB VII from Leon Uris ?) didn't come at end when the War was over. Furthermore, these cruel exercises of experimentation continued with or without the total consent of many regimes around the world. Brainwashes, hypnosis, subliminal messages, induced behavior patterns intermingled with many needs of an emerging market that desperately needed to blossom -if you may- as cathartic device in order to forget the horrid memories of a recent past.<br /><br />Dark films like Stalag 17, Shock corridor,  Psycho,Invasion of the body snatchers, Them, The man with the golden arm, Bitter victory, Catch 22, The planet of the apes, The island of Dr. Moreau, Dementia 13 or THX 1138, were part of many films that explored and felt the necessity to express the dark side of the moon as product of a brave new world that now had to deal with the consequences of the nuclear issues, radioactive residues, contamination and pollution. But there was something more in the air, the political environment (the well known witch's hunt undertaken by then), was also at its most algid moment. Spies everywhere plus the tensions derived from the Cold War were motives far enough to forge a social corpus in which the insanity and the spiritual wounds made to blossom the birth of the rock, the cool jazz and the new rebel kids of the Literature as Alan Gingsberg, Jack Kerouac or Camus, Sartre, Andric, Hamsun on the other side of the Atlantic.<br /><br />These reflections are present and suggested in the film, through audacious metaphors and apparently coincidental facts.<br /><br />Kingsley as always steals the show (He is one of the ten greatest actors in the world); Max von Sydow is superb too in his brief cameo, Mark Ruffalo plays a sensitive but crucial role and Di Caprio exhibits punch and talent.<br /><br />A worthy to watch film.</p></br><a href="../users/A18SDN3HYFVH2L.html">A18SDN3HYFVH2L</a><br/><p>Like many people who follow upcoming movies fairly intensely, I had the ending to Martin Scorsese's newest spoiled for me months ago.  Don't worry dear reader, I'm going to try my hardest not to do the same to you.  But I'm not sure that it mattered so much, really, for me - I think I would have guessed that SOMETHING funny was going on pretty quickly.  It's a film that builds slowly and steadily towards the final revelation, piling on clues in almost every scene - some are quite subtle, some I think would be picked up on even by viewers not so sharp-eyed, by viewers who haven't seen as many films as I have.  To the film's credit, though, I think even people following pretty closely probably won't figure out precisely what is strange about, or wrong with Teddy and his partner Chuck, though most ought to know that something is pretty rotten in the state of Denmark before the halfway point.<br /><br />Well just who are Teddy and Chuck then?  Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are a couple of US Marshalls come to investigate an escaped prisoner at Shutter Island, a facility for the criminally insane and dangerous in Boston Harbor, in 1954.  Apparently a woman, Rachel Solando, who was committed for having drowned her three children, has escaped from a locked room and cannot be found anywhere - though the island is walled by sheer cliffs except in a small beach area where the pier stands, and the weather is so inhospitable that no one could have gotten off to the mainland.  Something's not right though, and as Teddy and Chuck try to figure out what happened to Rachel they begin to wonder just what the doctors, led by Dr. John Cawley (Ben Kingsley) are doing with the patients - and Teddy starts to experience nightmares and flashbacks to his own experiences in World War II, which seem to mirror some of the feelings he's having, and perhaps even the events that are occuring in the present day.<br /><br />To say too much more about the film risks revealing too much; suffice it to say that for me this was a beautifully put together psychological thriller and puzzler, and that far from being an example of the director in "mainstream" mode as some critics have asserted - selling out and dumbing himself down - it's in fact a tribute to the glossy studio filmmaking of old as much as it is a contemporary work.  The whole film has an aura of uber-reality or just classic "Hollywood studio" reality that fit both the noirish setting and the increasing psychological fantasy angle.  Notice how the sky in most shots looks a little odd - a little digitally altered I think.  Various elements of the landscape often seem to stand out more harshly than they should - or, occasionally, they look softer.  When Teddy's in the cave and the camera looks out it appears completely fake and set-like to me; when he's in the jeep with the warden it's done with rear-projection, or it beautifully mimics the process; the effect is much like that in a Hitchcock film from the mid 50s - THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH or VERTIGO.  The blood in the fantasy scenes, in particular that of the Nazi commandant, is overly rich and bright - the phonograph too looks really burnished and bright like old Technicolor.  SHUTTER ISLAND for any flaws it might have as a narrative, is one of the most beautifully shot and lit films I've seen in a long time, with impeccable art direction and production design.<br /><br />About the narrative, again - without revealing too much, I will say that the revelation, when it comes, is a little too tidy, a little too wrapped-up-nice I think, given the wild fantastic moods that the film has developed up until this point.  And for me that was a bit of a problem - I think it could have stood a more "open" ending, and I think many will agree that it's just a bit too talky, a bit too much of the "now, this is why this happened and what it REALLY meant".  But at the same time - this isn't David Lynch, though at times there's a faint Lynchian surrealism at work.  This is Scorsese channelling Hitchcock at times, and perhaps Samuel Fuller (whose film SHOCK CORRIDOR is also set in an institution for the criminally insane), and his late friend Michael Powell, whose color films of the 40s had a similar glossiness and artificiality, a heightened or altered reality that wasn't quite fantasy but wasn't everyday either.  I was also reminded, interestingly enough, of Alex Proyas' film DARK CITY which is another film with a very hermetic, closed-in and noirish pulpy atmosphere (SHUTTER ISLAND takes place entirely on the island save for a couple of flashbacks, just as DARK CITY never leaves the eponymous city, and involves a hero with a possibly faulty memory).<br /><br />The use of music recalls other films as well - most of it is rather scary late 20th century classical work by composers like Scelsi, Cage and Ligeti, with a significant role played by the earlier Mahler Piano Quintet.  This isn't the world of the film noir or old Hollywood, more likely something out of a Stanley Kubrick film, and there are some moments where SHUTTER ISLAND seems ready to ascend to the heights of 2001 or THE SHINING.  I'm not trying to suggest that Scorsese is aping or copying all of these other great filmmakers - merely that he is building on their foundations, and giving cineastes like me an extra level of fun; and I don't think the film requires any great cinematic knowledge to succeed, either.  If he doesn't quite, in my opinion, reach the level of some of these great masterpieces, it's probably because the narrative at the end can't really break its bounds and reach for the stars - or for the madness - that it seems to be heading towards.  But darn, it's a fun ride.<br /><br />The cast is excellent, particularly I think Ruffalo in a subtle and very demanding role that has to reveal itself very, very slowly; but for the most part this is Scorsese's show and that of his behind-the-camera people including screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis (adapting a Dennis Lehane novel), music supervisor Robbie Robertson, his usual editor Thelma Schoonmaker, and perhaps especially cinematographer Robert Richardson.  SHUTTER ISLAND creates an environment of dread and unease, a just-not-quite real world that will bear many repeated viewings even though the secret is known and the story unravelled.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>It is well known that Martin Scorsese is a master filmmaker. Decade after decade he has continuously defied conventional formulas and provided artful films that explore all sides of the human condition. Granted, most of his films delve into the darker recesses of the human mind, and Shutter Island is no exception. It is a haunting experience, a film which uses both abstract and concrete techniques to tell a story. It may connect with mainstream audiences and it may not - but this much is true: in a society where Avatar can gross over six hundred million dollars and receive a nomination for BEST PICTURE of the YEAR, Shutter Island is a welcome luxury. It's like a drink of cool water after a particularly dehydrating hike in a desert abounding with the sort of intellectually devoid effects- driven action films, inane romantic comedies, and manipulative tearjerkers which are transforming American audiences into mumbling, drooling philistines year after year.<br /><br />Shutter Island is the rare type of film that is difficult to review, only because it contains many plot twists which are crucial to the fantastic finale. In an attempt to avoid unnecessary spoilers, a brief outline of the plot will be provided, followed by a technical and artistic critique of the film.<br /><br />The film opens in 1954, as a lone ferry arrives on an island which is reminiscent of Alcatraz, only it is not a prison in the usual sense. Rather, it is the location of a prestigious mental institution which houses only the most threatening patients, most of which have been committed for murder. After the disappearance of a vastly disturbed female resident, two U.S. marshals are summoned and arrive on the site to investigate, and fall upon one shocking revelation after another.<br /><br />This film is drenched in atmosphere from beginning to end. From the opening strains of Gy&ouml;rgy Ligeti's haunting chamber piece "Lontano", to the initial appearance of the island itself, there is no doubt - you "feel" this film. Once the mood settles in during the first few moments, it stays with you until the credits roll. Through this expertly crafted juxtaposition of atmosphere and musical selection, Shutter Island springs to life.<br /><br />The performances are uniformly amazing. Leonardo DiCaprio gives another knockout performance as Teddy, one of the marshals assigned to the case. Like Robert DeNiro and Harvey Keitel before him, DiCaprio's acting sensibilities have captured the attention of Scorsese, who has continued to cast him in several notable roles over the past few years, the most significant of which is his role in The Departed. Through Scorsese's direction, DiCaprio has been able to grow as an actor, and the results of this partnership are clearly on display in Shutter Island. Mark Ruffalo plays Teddy's partner, Chuck. Ruffalo exudes the necessary amount of intensity required by his character, and is wholly convincing. Scorsese also manages to draw some fantastic performances out of screen legends, Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow. These two men convey a palpable sense of dread throughout the film in varying degrees. Watching the two men work under Scorsese's sure-fire direction is worth the price of admission alone. Patricia Clarkson also appears and in a memorable supporting role, and the same can be said of Michelle Williams.<br /><br />As far as the direction itself, if you want to see a master at work, look no further than this film. It is a marvel in all aspects. This is Scorsese in top form. This is a film that simply cannot be missed.<br /><br />Rated R for disturbing violent content, language and brief nudity. 138 min.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Shutter Island is a film directed by Martin Scorsese and is based on the Dennis Lehane novel of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061703257">the same name</a>, a book I have not read which is something to clearly keep in mind.  It is a period film that takes place in the mid-1950s and follows two US Marshalls played by Mark Ruffalo and Leonardo DiCaprio, as they make their way to an island off the coast of Massachusetts that houses and attempts to rehabilitate the very worst criminally insane patients.  Scorcese uses both intense personal drama and the story's winding and mysterious premise to create a remarkable and intriguing suspense that feels like a hybrid of Hitchcock and some of Stanley Kubrick's later films.  It is a movie that will go over the heads of most of its audience during the first viewing, but to its core it is a psychological thriller that not only displays madness in a palpable frame but does so with astounding cinematic flair, and goes even further in making a commentary on the great flaws of violent men.<br /><br />Funny how some of the most savvy film critics have derided Shutter Island for lacking some of the elements I've already praised, but I can't help thinking they were preparing their judgments well in advance simply because of the film's delayed and altogether unconventional release date for an esteemed veteran filmmaker like Scorsese, who like anyone else at or near his level should release their films in the fall, just so everyone knows what movies to give awards to.  This actually might be one of my favorite Scorcese films, not only because it is one of his few movies that deviates from being simple gangster glorification, but because it is not a genre film at all.  I had a hard time pigeon-holing this movie as a horror film or just a general suspenseful drama when its means are far greater than just giving us a puzzle or scaring the hell out of us.  Either way it blows The Departed out of the water in my humble view, but then again my favorite Scorcese movies are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX8S">The Age of Innocence</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1559409037">The Last Temptation of Christ</a>, so take that for what it is.  We all have our opinions I suppose.<br /><br />Scorcese is a great director but not necessarily because he makes great stories and creates cutting edge films.  It is because at times he takes already great stories and makes them into shiny and exciting films, and also because he possesses his actors so well that they almost always get the credit that he might often deserve.  For years it was Robert De Niro, who outside of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007Y08MY">The Godfather part II</a> has only been truly great under Scorcese.  The same can be said for the way that Scorcese has contained the frenzied method acting of Daniel Day Lewis.  But now, and perhaps in the future surpassing both aforementioned actors, is Leonardo DiCaprio, who in my view might deliver his most touching and satisfying performance to date.  This is a guy who simply should not care whether or not the Oscars of 2010 remember his movie, because it is just another highlight in what might possibly turn out to be the greatest Hollywood career of his generation.  Neither should the rest of the cast that includes great work from Max Von Sydow, Ruffalo, Emily Mortimer, Michelle Williams, Ben Kingsley, Jackie Earle Haley, and Ted Levine.<br /><br />Shutter Island also captures New England in a way that few films have and growing up there myself certainly helps my appreciation of that.  Its cinematography is what we've come to expect from Scorcese's films but that doesn't mean it shouldn't go without specific praise.  The movie is visual perfection in addition to being a challenging, perplexing, and powerful motion picture. Despite a curious release date, and one that keeps it from competing in a 2009 Oscar awards ceremony that it would likely do quite well in, this is a layered commentary and an impeccably well-made production, and I must give it my highest recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DRKVXO300RUE.html">A1DRKVXO300RUE</a><br/><p>My original review is below. Updating to reflect my views of the Blu Ray transfer - its simply phenomenal.  A definite 5/5 star rating for both the video and audio quality.<br /><br />___<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie largely because of its excellence in several different categories.  First, the cinematography, camera angles, set design, production values, etc. are simply outstanding.  Brilliant use of flash-back work, slowly falling snow (reminds me of that great sword fight scene in Kill Bill), etc. all combine to create a visually stunning film.  Second, the acting was very good.  The cast was great, and each person was outstanding for his/her particular role.  Ben Kingsly was very believable as a brilliant psych, and his team were great too (including the German guy - perfect casting for the role).  Even Leo, who I often find unbelievable, was outstanding.  The story was phenomenal too.  I was really expecting a more shock/horror type film, but this was much more aligned with the thriller/suspense line.  The movie ends with intimating that one of two potential interpretations of the film are possible.  I personally believe that the evidence for one interpretation outweighs the other (largely because of a final line of dialogue - "is it better to live as a monster or die as a good guy" (or something like that).  But the story is so well constructed that you could legitimately argue for either interpretation.  Further, while potential twists are somewhat telegraphed early in the film, the primary premise is so well developed and so believable that you don't find yourself constantly predicting the ending.  You should note that the film invites thinking and a bit of debate; if you're looking for a mindless thriller, you'll enjoy, but you'll enjoy much more if you're willing to be cerebrally engaged.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>A supernatural thriller seen through a Federal Marshall's perspective, "Shutter Island" is a suspenseful edge-of-the-seat movie. A brisk pace helps heighten the tension, as U. S. Marshals Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Ruffalo) are sent to Shutter Island, an Alcatraz Island for the criminally insane, to investigate the mysterious - and seemingly impossible - disappearance/escape of a beautiful female patient, Rachel Solando (Mortimer) from Ashcliffe Hospital. As the two uncover further clues and interview the physicians and staff, they quickly realize Shutter Island has skeletons in the closet, a possible background of illegal and experimental treatments on patients, and the misleading facts about the facility are hindered by hospital medical personal who are not telling the whole truth.<br /><br />Parallels can be drawn to various other suspense thrillers - most notably <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BRZ5J2">The Sixth Sense</a> - but they're not so obvious as to belie the paranoia or to minimize the success of the intricately twisted psychological storyline. Determining the villains and truths is the primary enjoyment while watching Scorsese's interpretation of Dennis Lehane's novel.  The plot and lack of action causes the movie to drag at times, and the ominous feeling desired by Scorsese is somewhat lacking.<br /><br />The acting, however, is top notch except for a few characters.  While DiCaprio is as intense as ever - and further displaying why he might be the best young actor of his generation - and Ruffalo is adept as his partner, the staff at Shutter Island, with the exception of Ben Kingsley as a caring, competent psychiatrist, are simply not enjoyable.  Ted Levin, someone I usually appreciate, is insignificant as the warden; John Carroll Lynch is just as bland as the Deputy Warden.  And Max von Sydow may as well have looked into the camera and whispered, "I'm cashing this one in."  There are two bright spots, however, and they are Jackie Earle Haley as patient/prisoner George Noyce, and Elias Koteas as Laeddis.  While Koteas is scary, and his makeup job memorable, it's Haley who deserves recognition.  Just like his performance as Rorschach in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB55H6">Watchmen</a>, he steals the show when he's on screen.  Seen in a dark, filthy cell, he delivers a chilling warning with the passion of someone who actually might be crazy.  Mesmerizing performance.<br /><br />There are a few minor differences from the book that can't be held against anyone involved with the movie.  Even though I really wanted a specific scene with an armed ferry to be included.  Overall, however, something else is definitely lacking.  I don't know if the hospital staff needs to be more evil, or the story needs to be more foreboding.  Either way, it didn't feel as terrifying as I expected it to be, despite the overall impressive quality of the film.  Accolades for cinematographer Robert Richardson (Inglourious Basterds, Aviator, Kill Bill 1 & 2, Casino) are deserved.  While the actors don't necessarily deliver consistently throughout the entire movie, the island itself stars in Richardson's capable hands.<br /><br />Overall, a very good movie, definitely worth seeing at the theater, but missing that je ne sais quoi.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>I don't make a habit of watching Leonardo DiCaprio films, but the premise of Shutter Island intrigued me.  It looked like a dark and moody thriller, and that's exactly what it turned out to be.  Setting the story in the 1950s grants the film a strong film noir quality that works hand in hand with the gritty cinematography to produce an atmosphere that mirrors the psychological darkness hanging over the entire story.  This is a place with more than a few similarities to Alcatraz, and much of the story takes place during hurricane-like conditions that only intensify the lonely desperation of a place completely cut off from the normal world.<br /><br />DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, a U.S. marshal who goes to Boston Harbor's Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a patient from Ashecliffe Hospital.  Rachel Solando is no ordinary patient, and Ashecliffe is no ordinary hospital.  Shutter Island, you see, is home to the criminally insane, the kind of people that society and the system - but not Drs. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Naehring (Max Von Sydow) - have given up on.  They are on the cutting edge of psychiatric medicine and are attempting to rehabilitate the likes of Rachel, who bought her ticket there by drowning her three kids in the lake behind her home.  The case is not an easy one for Daniels.  He's working with a brand new partner in Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), the docs aren't all that generous in terms of sharing data on the patients and staff members, and it looks very much as if Rachel Solando simply disappeared into thin air.  Daniels also harbors some psychological demons inside his own head - his disturbing memories from the liberation of Dachau and the death of his young wife.  He also has an ulterior motive for being there, as he has reason to believe the man responsible for his wife's death is there on the island.  Additionally, his research into Ashecliffe makes him suspect that the good doctors there are actually up to no good at all, conducting the kinds of research and tests that the Nazis pioneered during the Third Reich.<br /><br />The plot takes a number of unsettling twists and turns, as Scorsese brilliantly manipulates the audience in a number of mesmerizing ways, constructing a psychological labyrinth of sudden dead ends and hidden chambers.  Every time you think you have the story figured out, it twists away from you in a new direction.  You're routinely left wondering what is real and what is imagined throughout the film's 138 minute runtime.  It takes a great script, a great director, and a great actor to make a film like this work, and Shutter Island is blessed with all of the above.  Leo's not one of my favorites, but I do concede the fact that he is a talented actor.  Brilliantly conceived and executed, Shutter Island is a thinking man's suspense thriller that leaves certain aspects of the story open to interpretation even after the final truth is revealed.  As such, it is one of those rare films that prove just as fascinating the second time through as it was the first.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>You ever sit down to watch a film, mainly because someone has raved a particular performance and you really want to see what all the hype was about, only to find yourself scratching your head over that said performance, wondering how it is that anyone found it `rave-worthy'?  You're sitting there staring at the screen waiting for that moment when it all comes together, you know...that `ah ha' moment, but the movie is nearly over and you still haven't seen it yet.  You're just about to give up all hope and then it happens.  You're awestruck but what you're witnessing, and suddenly it all makes sense and you realize just how GENIUS the performance was from start to finish.<br /><br />I had one of those this year.<br /><br />With Oscar nominations due to be announce next week, I've given a lot of thought to performances that are NOT going to be nominated but really should.  Colin Farrell's subtle yet moving work in `Ondine', Kirsten Dunst's stunning work in the train-wreck of a movie `All Good Things', JULIANNE MOORE IN `THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT'...and right up there is a brilliantly crafted performance by Mr. Oscarless himself; Leonardo DiCaprio.<br /><br />`Shutter Island', the film, is a little uneven for me to completely rave.  It has its moments, and when Scorsese does it right he nearly nails it, but the films textures are a tad mismatched for me to buy it completely.  The whole noir vibe seems to overlap the horror aspects of the film without meeting them for a full mesh; and the films overall construction is far too revealing to be fully effective (those flashback sequences were just a total mess).  I had previously read the novel, and so I knew the ending (which is pretty clich&eacute;d, if you ask me) but the film doesn't try and shield you from the truth at all.  It basically hits you over the head with the eventualities which take away from the sting.<br /><br />That said; it is within that ending that Leonardo DiCaprio does something remarkable.<br /><br />Throughout most of the film I found Leonardo to be serviceable at best; but to be honest I kind of leaned towards `this performance is downright bad'.  He was a poor mans Humphrey Bogart and it showed.  His accent work was a tad spotty (no where near as consistent as in `The Departed' yet no where near as dreadful as in `Blood Diamond') but overall he just came across like a bad actor.  His reactions to situations played too heavily on the `amateurish' side of things.  You could see right through him.  He seemed so out of place.  As the film continued to delude into preposterous scenarios (it is pretty faithful to the novel, which was also too obvious for its own good), DiCaprio continued to strip away any credibility to his character.  Granted, I knew the eventual outcome and so maybe that's why DiCaprio was so `obvious' to me, but it still bothered me.<br /><br />And then there was that moment, in the lighthouse, where Teddy's world came crashing down.<br /><br />In a gutting sequence of raw human abandonment, Leonardo transforms Teddy into Andrew and delivers enough shocking reality to the screen to mask the fact that we saw this coming a mile (two miles even) away.  Yes, the shtick is gone; the scared, confused man pretending to be something he's not is thrown completely out the window and instead we have replaced him with a man very much inside his own private torment.  The anguish on his face as the falsified tremors start to take on a more honest tone is ever reaching.  And then comes the dreaded flashback that has been hinted at from the moment the film started, when the `truth' is revealed.  In that moment, DiCaprio `goes there' in every sense of the word.  His gut reactions are pure and understandable.  His complete collapse is everything it needed to be to sell the moment.<br /><br />His sobbing mirrored mine, so I knew it was legit.<br /><br />And here is the most remarkable part of all.  As I watched him completely flip his character and the way he was approaching him it shed so much light on the character he had created, the character that Andrew had created.  Every moment of the film where I felt Leonardo was phoning it in or where I felt he was in over his head were now moments where I felt he was, without question, flawless.<br /><br />He built a character within a character within a character; take that `Inception'.<br /><br />In the end, I wish I could pimp this out for the Oscar this year, but my opinion carried no weight.  If DiCaprio could just pull out a surprise nomination; oh how wonderful that would be.  What he accomplished here was no easy task, for his character shifts create tonal shifts in the entire film.  He controls where this film goes, for the better.  He understands that only he can elevate this film, and he does it with an ease that is undeniable.<br /><br />"So, what's our next move?"</p></br><a href="../users/AYZLXLVMJGTJV.html">AYZLXLVMJGTJV</a><br/><p>This movie was about a federal officer who goes to an island to investigate a missing fugitive. The island has a supernatural feel to it, that gives off a creepy vibe. The staff are very odd when it comes time to answer questions. The missing girl is a criminal patient in a prison mental health facility. The explanation on how the girl went missing was again unexplainable and mysterious. Leo who is the key character and lead officer feels frustrated because he is not getting answers and is starting to pitch out signs of anxiety. He is thinking he will write up his reports and leave due to the staff and head adminstrator's lack of cooperation. He has eerie flashbacks before leaving which prompt him to stay and give us a clue to his character. He is holding onto a painful memory that haunts him. This memory is also including dreamlike episodes with his deceased wife, who helps him to gain access to solving particular problems or guiding him in his life journey. Her image is also suspense building and dark. The story leads to the runaway being found. She is living in a world of her own and cannot grasp the reality of her circumstances. She has killed her children and been on the island to serve out her time while being treated. She meets up with Leo's character and sees him as her dead husband. Until she shifts abruptly and realizes he is not what she thought. Here the story starts to become quite interesting. It is hard to go into and there are a few twists which are quite arresting and thought provoking. The plot takes on a whole new avenue of development. Is Leo actually a patient who is suffering from a delusion. A delusion is a fixed fact that cannot be broken or is he being turned into this because he has stumbled onto some possible damning evidence that could hurt others. This is where I think the viewer has to decide. It could be easy and he could just be a patient not wanting to face his actions and living out his delusion or he really could have been erased, meaning his identity taken from him by mind control and drugs. I won't go further with this. What I took away from this film was an uneasy feeling of coincidence, won't go into why. I liked the isolation of an island and the rocky cliffs with the crashing waves. I guess it gave off a remote piercing kind of feel, wild and beautiful. The isolation fed into the eerie hospital and adminstrator's personality. The apparation of the woman doctor,or was it, seemed intriguing again lending a question. Do you believe it? Could something like this be done? Absolutely. Would one want to be in a mental hospital like this. Was it pretending to be caring and concerned about unlocking the psyche from its unending hell or was it experimenting on people for the benefit of science or something else. These are again thoughts, questions. The atmosphere feels secretive and guarded so that suggests a possible dysfunction. The staff could have been looked at thru the eyes of a delusional patient so its all uncertain. There are parts that i would have liked to have viewed again but did not. Memories being taken? Feelings being medicated.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>If you don't like watching films twice, then I suggest you not view SHUTTER ISLAND even once. But if you do, you need to click over to the extra features on the DVD and watch "The Making of Shutter Island." It is here where you will begin to realize how important it is to restart the disc from the beginning.<br /><br />Shutter Island is a film-within-a-film, about a character-within-a-character. The multiple layers and textures are unbelievably inviting in a very twisted sense. The entire film screams thriller, but after you view it a second time, it'll scream ...something entirely different.<br /><br />Dividing audiences and critics, Shutter Island reveals itself to probably be too dense for many, but a revelatory success for others; I'm obviously in the latter category.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5AJQI">The Departed</a>) has rapidly become director Martin Scorsese's muse (and rightfully so). The two have been nearly inseparable since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XUBDVK">Gangs of New York</a>. "Marty" saw something inside Leonardo and knew that he had the acting chops needed for some fairly tough roles. And here, on Shutter Island, Marty gives him his toughest role to date.<br /><br />As soon as we see Federal Marshals Teddy Daniels (Leonardo) and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HN699K">Where the Wild Things Are</a>) arrive on Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a mentally deranged prisoner, we get the immediate sense that things are off-balance. The guards look at Teddy and Chuck with great apprehension; their weapons pointed in Teddy and Chuck's general direction.<br /><br />And as Teddy's investigation winds up, so do clues that don't match up. The possibility of a 67th patient being on the island, even though the warden and his charges claim there are only 66, tips Teddy (and the viewer) off that something is amiss.<br /><br />The dark edges surrounding the island also leads Teddy into flashbacks of his time in WW II, and into other muted corners of his past that he'd rather not see.<br /><br />It is these dark corners that intrigue Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UAE7KO">You Kill Me</a>) and his partner Dr, Naehring (Max von Sydow, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001WLMOG4">The Seventh Seal</a>), themselves being psychiatrists. But we quickly garner that these two men are at opposite ends of the same field. And are they fighting each other over Teddy? If so, why?<br /><br />It is here that I'll stop any further possibility of spoilers for those who choose to read this review. And it is also here that I need to reaffirm the requirement that you watch this movie twice. If you do, you'll come away feeling as though you've seen two movies instead of just one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>Shutter Island is a very ambiguous film. I knew exactly what direction it was going in about halfway through it, and yet, after the credits rolled, my mind was a jumble trying to decipher what I just watched. In my opinion, I don't think the ending was as crystal clear as the film would like you to believe. The 'Is Teddy sane or insane?' arguments are abundant on the internet. The movie would like you to believe that he is indeed, insane and there is proof from the very beginning. However, one can counter that for all the evidence, it can still very easily be twisted so that the other argument wins out. It is not as dry cut as it appears, or as they state. This movie desperately needs multiple viewings.<br /><br />In my mind, the final truth that confirmed the 'sane' argument was that final haunting shot of the lighthouse. The people that saw this film know what I am talking about. There are so many theories going around and I honestly think the whole point of this film is to make people crazy trying to figure everything out.<br /><br />Many people who don't like Shutter Island call it a cop-out and a huge 'gocha!' joke. I can see how that would frustrate someone-that is, if you believe the 'insane' argument. This can go back and forth. I havent seen a movie like this in ages, where you go back in your mind days after watching it and still try to reason things out.<br /><br />The performances are top-notch and the cinematography is just stunning. The colors are bold in a non-colorful way, but they stand out nonetheless. The imagery and lighting really sets the tone and I actually loved the over-the-top musical score. It almost made it seem like you were in the middle of a horror film, which this is not. But it still fits so perfectly because it really is the ideal way to set the scene, especially when it revolves around a creepy mental asylum.<br /><br />Truly, I would go into this film knowing as little about it as possible and allow the suspense and mystery to overtake you.</p></br><a href="../users/A17LEYMZI8OYOQ.html">A17LEYMZI8OYOQ</a><br/><p>SHUTTER ISLAND is Martin Scorsese's venture into Alfred Hitchcock territory.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that makes me a bit angry.  At 90-105 minutes, it could have been a classic of the genre, but like so many of Scorsese's movies (e.g. GANGS OF NEW YORK, THE AVIATOR), he lets it go on far too long.  137 minutes to be exact.<br /><br />Don't misunderstand.  I think that Scorsese is one of our finest living filmmakers, and SHUTTER ISLAND is an extremely well-made picture.  However, what Marty doesn't seem to get is that "less is more".<br /><br />Without going into plot specifics, the first act of the picture works very well.  Scorsese creates a wonderful spooky, haunted house-like atmosphere that totally draws you into the story.<br /><br />But, the second act is a total mess.  It wanders all over the place and, rather than my jumping in my seat when the director probably hoped that I would do so, I found myself wondering when the movie was going to get to its overdue climax.  In other words, I was bored.<br /><br />However, there is a twist that leads into the third act that totally took me by surprise and from that point on, I was back with the movie.<br /><br />I just wish that Scorsese and company could have gotten to that point sooner.<br /><br />This is definitely no criticism of the actors, but I would have cut the roles played by Ted Levine and Elias Koteas.  They were totally unnecessary and their scenes did not move the story forward.  I would have also cut some of Michelle Williams' scenes for the same reason.<br /><br />? Michael B. Druxman</p></br><a href="../users/AE9V37MS6QY8D.html">AE9V37MS6QY8D</a><br/><p>I'm not as huge a fan as most movie critics are of Martin Scorcese, but I do enjoy his films and was excited when I viewed the trailer for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061703257">Shutter Island</a>, based on the novel by Dennis Lehane (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060584750">Mystic River</a>). And while I'm not the biggest Leonardo DiCaprio fan, I still consider him a good, serious actor.  And when I viewed the film, I was taken aback by Scorcese's cool visuals accompanied by a ridiculous score, which Scorcese and musician Robbie Robertson attempted to pull a "Tarantino" by mixing various style scores/compositions into scenes.  Unlike Quentin Tarantino's talent at this style, I found Scorcese and Robertson's picks to be completely out of place.  Whereas Tarantino scrounges every possible genre of music, this selection was still limited to music that had that cheesy 1950s horror film feel to it.  And I get why the filmmakers chose this music since the film does take place in 1954. However, the music becomes more of a distraction rather than a seamless, blending, artful, expressionistic character for filmmaking - the effect that any score should have on a film.<br /><br />All music aside, the film was good. The ending in no way lived up to the "twist-you'll-never-see-coming" status it was given by most movie critics and audiences, but it still was worthy of any mystery fan's money.  The acting is all spot-on with a great cast including Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams, Max von Sydow, Jackie Earle Haley, Patricia Clarkson, Emily Mortimer, Ted Levine, John Carroll Lynch, and Elias Koteas.  All of them great actors with very pivotal parts, yet, in my opinion, sadly, not used enough in the film. DiCaprio acts well enough but there is something slightly missing from this film, preventing it from being one of the year's best.<br /><br />I wish I could put my finger on what exactly is missing, but it's difficult to identify.  Scorcese pulls out all the stops and the filmmaking is sufficient, however, the story itself on celluloid is too outlandish and too pretentious.  The ending was open to interpretation but that's not what put me off - in fact, I liked the ending.  What put a bad taste in my mouth was the lack of explanation into how the entire surprising twist of a plotline could have been executed in the first place. For the sake of surprising the audience at the end, the filmmakers don't show or explain how our protagonist is placed in the position at the beginning other than simply alluding to a fact that the audience has to assume.  This may not sound like much to make the movie "so-so" but it is a big deal in terms of the story's progression, and should be treated as such. Also, being a father, I wasn't too crazy about the flashback scene involving kids.<br /><br />Nevertheless, "Shutter Island" does take a Hitchcockian twist and turns out a decent story. I am a fan of the novel's author, Dennis Lehane, because his stories are so cinematic and I love his attempt to mix film noir mystery with a period piece. And there are some movies based on books that although not as great as their literary companion are still great adaptations and worth watching (i.e., <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4LPJ6">Battle Royale: Director's Cut (Collector's Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IYEQR4">Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut [Blu-ray</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785134352">Kick-Ass</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CLBJV4">High Fidelity</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MYIXAW">Let the Right One In [Blu-ray</a>]). However, this film unfortunately doesn't quite make that cut. If you've read the book, the movie will be somewhat of a disappointment only because the book (when it first came out and I read it) was so surprising and great. But, maybe that's the rub; if you read the book, there's almost no need to see this film 'cause most of the book was put on screen.  The movie's "Good" status -- rather than "Great" -- is not because of the acting or directing, which are both satisfactory - it's simply the adaptation.  Acting and directing: satisfactory; story structure: mediocre.<br /><br />Scorcese has always had an artistic take on film and moviemaking, whether he's shooting the grimy, grainy black-and-white world of a boxing ring, or the flashy, colorful casinos of the Vegas mob. He's an icon in the truest sense of the word. His take on Dennis Lehane's 1950s-set thriller is a new territory for him and he shoots it well. The story is a must for any noir mystery thriller fiction fan, but viewing the movie should only come after experiencing the ultimate "director's cut" -- the book.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Filled with surreal imagery, supported by strong performances from Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo, the marvelous Max Von Sydow and Jackie Early Haley "Shutter Island" has some magnificent moody movements and while it isn't great Scorsese it is very good indeed. A mystery thriller based on Dennis Lehane's (GONE BABY GONE)novel the moody mystery revolves around a patient that has simply vanished from an island for the criminally insane and the pair of federal marshals Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio)a troubled veteran of World War II still disturbed by the images he saw when he helped liberate a German concentration camp and his new partner Chuck Aule (Ruffalo) trying to determine why they are being stonewalled about her disappearance. It's clear from the beginning to Daniels that the staff at the isolated hospital seems to be hiding something the trouble is that everything seems to be hiding in plain sight. On the surface they get cooperation but it's also quite clear that there are members of the staff and even some of the patients that have been carefully rehearsed to hide something.<br /><br />While "Shutter Island" isn't among the best films that Scorsese has made it does demonstrate what a talented film director can do with good source material. At turns spooky and suspense "Shutter Island" probably could have been trimmed about 10 minutes. The main flaw of the film is that it doesn't pander to its audience by using rapid fire editing techniques to generate an artificial feeling of suspense and unease instead relying on craftsmanship and strong, intelligent performances by the performers in the film. Keep in mind that "Shutter Island" is an example of a slow, moody thriller and, in many respects, is a throwback to the type of thrillers we might have seen in the 70's (which isn't a surprise given that Scorsese came of age as a film director during that time). Don't expect the rapid fire editing of "Final Destination" or linear narrative of most contemporary films. "Shutter Island" has more in common with "Memento" or Chris Nolan's mixed genre thriller "The Prestige" than "The Bourne Identity". I'd also note that the film is a moody homage to Hitchcock's thrillers.<br /><br />Scorsese has never been a director that has focused on complex plots (although there are exceptions in his career but those exceptions have usually been when he's been paired with a strong writing collaborator) as much as complex characters. Perhaps that's the Achilles' heel of "Shutter Island" as the occasionally careens out of control as we watch Teddy dig deeper and deeper into the mystery that drives him to want to discover the evil at the heart of "Shutter Island". Working with the novel's strong more conventional narrative may have been too much a challenge for the director and his creative visuals. Nevertheless even if he does stumble the film manages to hold together fairly well and continues to be entertaining. Fans of the novel, suspenseful mystery thrillers, DiCaprio and Scorsese will still find much to admire and the last sequence in the film still cuts deeply.<br /><br />The conclusion of the film particularly the last dialogue exchange between DiCaprio and Ruffalo validates the film. Scorsese makes "Shutter Island" a suspenseful thriller that echoes some of Hitchcock's classic psychological thrillers (particularly "Vertigo" in its stylized look)producing a film that isn't afraid to look into the abyss of a lost soul in fear that the abyss might look back.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Two Federal Marshalls (Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo) travel to a spooky penal institute on a desolate island to investigate the disappearance of a prisoner.<br /><br />It's very hard to write about the plot of this film in any detail without spoiling it.  Suffice to say that I was engrossed by the masterful direction (Martin Scorsese), the intriguing setting, and the magnificent cast (which includes Ben Kingsley and the always delightful Max Von Sydow).  However, I also felt that the film did not play fair with me.  Early scenes set the stage in such a way that I felt cheated by certain revelations that came later.  While those revelations did give an added dimensions to some plot points that had seemed incongruous, they also seemed to open some holes in other respects.  I will probably watch this film again someday, and it may very well improve on a second viewing.  At that time, I may find myself wishing that the editing feature on Amazon reviews allowed us to change our star ratings.</p></br><a href="../users/AGNOPNCN6FHB6.html">AGNOPNCN6FHB6</a><br/><p>decided willingly to jump down the rabbit hole and be manipulated with incongruent story lines, images, and characters... kept waiting for Alice to wake up but no can do...

I guess when you compare it to Martin Scorsese's classic films, which have become some of the best ever made, it may seem that way. In my opinion, this is a damn fine movie. It does start off kind of slow, only at times. I have to say, I was pretty disappointed at how short Jackie Earle Haley's role was, considering he was one of the draws for me. I thought he would have a little more time at least, but he only had a brief cameo. That doesn't really matter because Leonardo DiCaprio completely owned this one. He was just fantastic. I've never gushed over any of his performances before (even though The Departed is one of my all-time favorite films), but there is absolutely no denying his talent in this one. His character covered every emotion that I can think of, and DiCaprio did a fine job at keeping us along for the ride. Actually, to be fair, the entire cast was perfect.<br /><br />Everyone from Ben Kingsley, to Mark Ruffalo. They all give convincing performances. There really is no reason for me to even talk about the acting. It was simply perfect. As for the screenplay. It was gripping. I don't read many books (except for graphic novels), but this movie made me seriously consider picking up the novel. Now I've read a few reviews for this movie, and complaints about the music being intrusive came up a couple times. Some people said that it was distracting at times. Well, I tried very hard to hear what they were talking about, but I didn't. I do have a couple of complaints though. I actually have the exact same complaint about this film, that I had about The Bad Lieutenant. Personally, I like it when nightmare and hallucination scenes appear real, but in Bad Lieutenant, and some of them in Shutter Island are obviously not. In the movie we are supposed to believe that some of the hallucinations are actually happening, but you can tell that they are not right of the bat. That's not my only problem with them. Some of the hallucinations (especially the ones we are not supposed to believe) are just stupid. Like why did we need to see a thousand rats on the cliff, or his wife turn to ash and crumble? That's just me though. That's probally a complaint that not too many people share. And it really isn't a major problem, because it was not an accident. It was just a directional decision that I do not necessarily agree with. Nevertheless, that did not ruin the movie for me.<br /><br />I'm surprised at how alot of critics and moviegoers are reacting so negatively to this film. It's certainly not a bad movie. Not in the slightest. Of course if you compare it to Scorsese's other films, it will not hold up. But if some rookie director would have been behind the camera, alot of people probally would not have been so harsh on it. I think this movie has one of the biggest, and best mind-effing end twists that I have ever seen, although it's not hard to see coming. It's still a must see. And the transfer, as expected from a modern release, is top notch. Beautifully translated to Blu-ray. The extras on the other hand are lacking. Very much so in fact, but that doesn't hinder this from being one of the better thrillers on the market. Highly Recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A16GAIJJE39T1S.html">A16GAIJJE39T1S</a><br/><p>Leonardo DiCaprio plays a U.S. Marshall called on to investigate the escape and disappearance of a patient from the Civil War island fortress which serves as an institute for the treatment of the criminally insane.  Set in the gray cold war year of 1954, DiCaprio's Marshall finds himself immediately enmeshed in a Kafkaesque maze presided over by the aloof chief psychiatrist played by Ben Kingsley.  As if being trapped on an island insane asylum accessible only by ferry in the midst of a terrible storm is not enough to face, the Marshall is also plagued by his own personal demons.  His dreams are marked by the beseeching eyes and voices of the dead, from his late wife (played hauntingly by Michelle Williams) to the inhabitants of the Nazi concentration camp at Dachau that he had encountered as an American soldier at the end of World War II.  The troubled and numerous dreams of the protagonist cause the audience to wonder which events correspond to reality and which exist only in his own mind--to the point where the movie becomes something other than a classic thriller.  The viewer is less inclined to sit on the edge of his seat if that which the protagonist encounters may be only his own dark thoughts.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D0PJFW2VY8G.html">A2D0PJFW2VY8G</a><br/><p>Martin Scorsese's 2010 collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio is a mystery thriller boasting an impressive cast with the likes of Mark Ruffalo and Sir Ben Kingsley supporting DiCaprio who takes the lead role. Scorsese immortalised himself in film history for me with the flawless Goodfellas (1990). The question was could he reclaim that same Midas touch with Shutter Island?<br /><br />Set in 1954, DiCaprio takes on the role of Teddy Daniels, a U.S. Marshal who is sent to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a patient from the Ashecliffe Hospital. Joined by his partner, Chuck (Mark Ruffalo), Teddy soon finds himself on the trail of Rachel Solando, the missing patient that came to the hospital after drowning her three children. What begins as a seemingly straightforward assignment becomes a fierce power struggle as Teddy and Chuck's efforts to find Rachel are frequently hindered by the evasive hospital staff with short memories, while Dr John Cawley (Ben Kingsley) seems to be at the head of a strange cover-up, but what are they all hiding?<br /><br />Shutter Island begins quickly with the opening scene showing Teddy and Chuck on a boat bound for the island. They're soon beginning their investigation and we gain insight into Teddy through a series of flashbacks of his time in the Second World War. The background to what he witnessed is slowly introduced but it's clear from the start that Teddy carries demons with him. Such constraints are not eased by the difficult hospital staff who reveal some information about the missing Rachel Solando but not enough for Teddy and Chuck to scratch beneath the surface. The insistence that Rachel somehow escaped from a locked room seems implausible but no one is talking and the frustration soon begins to build.<br /><br />As Teddy's investigation progresses it soon becomes clear that something is amiss on Shutter Island beyond the reluctance of any of the staff to say anything about Rachel Solando. Unfortunately, about an hour into the film I had speculated with Mrs B about what was going on and I'm disappointed to say that between us we sussed out the story well before the end! The failing I think was in too much information being revealed too soon. Seeing Teddy's flashbacks, beginning with the Second World War then moving onto his family, began with much intrigue but many will be able to hazard a guess at the twist to the story, which is good but too predictable.<br /><br />The film does boast an impressive setting on the island and the autumnal feel of the surroundings adds to the overall mystery. DiCaprio acquits himself well as the leading man while Mark Ruffalo, Sir Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow provide good support. The performances do not hinder the film which progresses well for the first hour but as soon as my speculation about the film's inevitable twist started to unfold I found myself disappointed. That said, Shutter Island does have one final shock to deliver and I'll hold my hands up and say I didn't see this one coming and it did help round the film off nicely.<br /><br />Shutter Island is an effective thriller with the isolated setting adding to the unease of the environment as soon as Teddy and Chuck set foot on shore. While the film maintains the interest for a while, the premature revelations of key aspects of the plot give the game away too soon. This is still worth watching especially as the final scene is much more difficult to predict than the core of the film's story.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>Leonardo DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, a federal marshal who is sent to the hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a patient. It is 1954, and mental health treatment is still pretty primitive. But he and his partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), soon begin to suspect that the hospital is using the patients for horrible experiments. Then Teddy starts having some really horrible dreams.<br /><br />The audience does not really know what is true, what is imagined, what is Teddy's nightmare, or what is what. This would be decidedly unfair if we did not get to the bottom of it, and discover the truth, before the end of the film. But we do. And frankly, I for one did not see it coming. Which is a high compliment for a mystery story.<br /><br />It's quite an adventure, pretty bloody at times, and DiCaprio has almost no sex appeal in this one. Almost.</p></br><a href="../users/AWSYTZ2I2MW0V.html">AWSYTZ2I2MW0V</a><br/><p>SHUTTER ISLAND is a good movie...the story of the film is really interesting...Leonardo DiCaprio got a lot of good movies, and this is another one!</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>****1/2<br /><br />Martin Scorsese's "Shutter Island" is a psychological thriller done in a florid, grand opera style.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo play two federal marshals circa the 1950s who've been sent to an isolated institute for the criminally insane, run by Max Von Sydow and Ben Kingsley, to investigate the mysterious disappearance of one of the patients there, a Medea-like figure who killed her own children a number of years back.  DiCaprio's character is also haunted by memories and dreams of his young wife (Michelle Williams) who died in a fire, and by his own traumatizing experience liberating Dachau at the close of World War II.  The two investigators soon discover that everything is not quite what it appears to be on Shutter Island and that indeed something quite nefarious and sinister may be going on there.<br /><br />Ever the agent provocateur, Scorsese brings a healthy dose of his trademarked purple-prose filmmaking style to the proceedings.  He sets his tale against a backdrop of howling winds, crashing waves and falling trees, punctuated by thundering chords pounding away on the soundtrack.  It may make the movie seem preposterously pretentious at first, but we soon learn that there is a method to Scorsese's madness, as what appears initially to be gratuitous showmanship on the part of the director becomes an integral part of the work once the details of the story emerge.<br /><br />This theme of who-is-truly-mad-and-who-is-truly-sane in this world has been played out many times before in the movies, but "Shutter Island" brings a level of sophistication to it that is really quite impressive.  The movie keeps us guessing at every stage of the drama, with the twists and turns of the storyline drawing us ever deeper into the surrealistic, fractured world it's created for itself.<br /><br />DiCaprio and Ruffalo both turn in outstanding performances, but this is Scorsese's movie all the way.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>I actually liked the movie, through out the movie it was good half way through I kind of knew how it would end.

While everything appears to be normal, as far as normal would go for a mental institution in the 1950s, there is always an unsettling element in the mix. The music and the camera angles used also assist greatly is setting the mood for this film.<br /><br />This movie unfolds like a maze, and it has you going down different rabbit holes, firstly, there is the issue of the missing female patient, that has disappeared under almost an impossible situation. Then there is a former Nazi doc, that raises the question of experimental brain surgery.<br /><br />The suspense develops as the weather deteriorates, the Federal Marshals get soaked in the rain and must dodge falling trees. Subsequently, they are provided with in-mate clothes and now sleep in bunk beds provided. The question that now presents itself, is: will they ever be allowed to leave the island? More questions and paranoia is thrown into the mix to keep you at the edge of your seat.<br /><br />This is a very gripping suspense thriller and keeps the maze going, and blurs reality and hallucination until the very end. A great movie that keeps you thinking as the plot turns and bends.</p></br><a href="../users/A24IJY3V0804WJ.html">A24IJY3V0804WJ</a><br/><p>Inception was a mind bender of a movie and people loved it but I fail to understand that the same people have ignored a similar themed Shutter Island. Based on Dennis Lehane's book Shutter Island is the story of two U.S. Marshalls, who go to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a patients Rachel Solando who has disappeared from a mental asylum on that island.  The duo set out to investigate the mysterious happenings and confront a shocking ending.<br />I thought the movie was excellent in all respects and a great adaptation of a fine book. It is hard to adapt great books but the movie does just that. The direction was first rate which was expected of a director like Martin Scorcese. Leonardo Caprio delivers a fine performance and I think is on his way to become one of the finest actors of his generation. The end of the movie was haunting and the viewer has to watch the movie carefully or twice to understand the twister. If you cannot, I suggest watch the making of instead. I loved the film. 3 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>This really is a return to form in many ways, for Scorcese the film-maker.  We're in Cape Fear territory here, inasmuch as our Martin clearly wants to show off his directorial skills, and his movie knowledge.  This is not a case of the director being invisible to the process to serve the story - here he is key in using all sorts of tricks and magic to entertain and surprise, visually, aurally and narratively.  Movie referencing is rife (look for the scene running up the stairs in the lighthouse, then go watch Vertigo again), and the nature of the story itself lends itself to some startling imagery.<br />So what's it about?  Well, the less said going in to the movie the better.. suffice to say, that DiCaprio (on blistering form) and his colleague (Mark Ruffalo - understated yet also excellent in the role) arrive in 1954 on the eponymous island as two Marshalls, sent to investigate reports of a missing person.  The island is a sanatorium for the criminally insane, lending a creepy and unsettling atmosphere from the first moment it appears through the mists.  They meet the doctors, Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow in their wonderfully Gothic setting, crackling fireplace and thundery soundtrack from the brewing storm.  However, as time goes by, DiCaprio feels his grip on reality loosening.  Is there a conspiracy on the island?  Is his past trauma in the war catching up with him?  Why do the facts signally fail to add up?  It's a great build - and even, if some have said, the plot is somewhat easy to guess at early on, the machinations to get there never fail to be interesting at the least, and mesmerising if like me you really get into the atmosphere of the movie.<br />Much credit to maintaining the atmosphere goes to the cinematography which is simply magnificent, lending an eerie, sepia toned hue to the period setting, and yet some startling colour imagery in the dream scenes.  The soundtrack too should get an honourable mention, using  modern classical music to create the off kilter feel, rather than one sound from one composer to unite the tone.  You really get the feeling that Marty was enjoying himself to bits making this - if giving him an Oscar encourages him to have this much fun without the weight of expectation, for goodness sake give him another one.<br />Bluray serves this movie very well - the clarity of those sounds, the storm, even the aforementioned crackle of the fireplace, all feel exactly where they should be, and the images are so vivid and startling in high definition it's worth going blu on this one.  If I didn't have a BR player already, this may well be the one that would tempt me to get one.<br />In a nutshell, this is utterly brilliant - at the same time revelling in the love of cinema of old, while adding his own distinctive Scorcese touch, topped with a performance from DiCaprio which roots you in the drama, this is one for those who love pure cinema.  It's eminently watchable, and as the best movies are, eminently rewatchable too.  Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>All I can really say (without giving any real spoilers) is that I liked this movie, and it had a cool surprise ending. Well, maybe for people who like this kind of movie, the ending isn't that much of a surprise, there are a few hints here and there that things are not quite what they seem, but they're not so blatantly obvious as to make it east to guess how the movie might end, so it was fairly satisfying.<br /><br />The storyline and acting are rather solid, and the camerawork is well done. I don't really have any major complaints about this film.

Like a lot of people do, I'm sure the mere mention of the director's name is, more often than not, associated with gangster movies or gritty character dramas. But here, he delves into something new - a psychological thriller. Shutter Island follows U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) to the aforementioned facility for the criminally insane, in which he's been asked to help find an escaped patient. During his investigation, he stumbles upon revelations and discoveries that lead to even more mysteries as he starts to question the true intentions of Dr. Cawley (Sir Ben Kingsley), the rest of the staff, and even his own partner (Mark Ruffalo). But with dreams and broken pieces of his past beginning to haunt him, paranoia, distrust, and denial are bound to distract his attention and twist his beliefs. Without spoiling the plot, Shutter Island is an excellent film set in the 1950s with an old-school detective feel to it that manages, not only to intrigue, but also present a good deal of empathy for the characters (something Scorsese excels at). In addition, it also manages to put something into perspective that I've never quite appreciated, and that's the acting ability of one Leonardo DiCaprio. I didn't particularly care for any of his roles in the '90s outside of The Quick and the Dead, but ever since seeing him in this, I've been playing catchup from Gangs of New York till now, and I have to say he's certainly developed into a fine actor with a lot of screen presence and charisma. Equally supportive of his work in the film, though, are some stellar supporting performances by Sir Kingsley, Ruffalo, and what little parts there are for Max von Sydow and Jackie Earle Haley. Shutter Island is a great psychological mystery/thriller that managed to keep me suspended from beginning to end and also has a good deal of replay value as well. You'll know what I mean when you see it.<br /><br />Video - 5.0<br /><br />By far the best quality of this video presentation is the colors. I was amazed at how vibrant the different shades of primaries were from scene to scene and in-between reality and Teddy's memories/dreams. From the cold and murky flashbacks of his days during the war and the snow-covered fields that covered the dozens of corpses in his path to the bright yellows and oranges of his wife's dress and their apartment, Robert Richardson's eye-popping photography makes for an equally tripped-out vision of the many layers residing in the film's visual progression. Black levels and contrast are perfect, giving the movie that dark and gritty Scorsese feel, but also complimenting the atmospherics. The fine lines in clothing, the blades of grass and lush tree leaves in the courtyard, and all the little cracks and crevices within the island's surrounding rocks and cliffs look astonishing. This is by far the prettiest gritty picture I've seen from Scorsese yet and is something I'm very pleased with. One of my favorite shots is the scene where Teddy and Chuck (Ruffalo) are standing on the cliff with the deputy warden looking down at the water. I'm not sure whether or not the clouds and background behind them were green screened, but something about that shot just feels dark, spooky, and ominous and very befitting for the kind of movie this is. The picture is pristine and free of any artifacts or debris and shows no signs of any kind of manipulation whatsoever. Here's hoping to the same kind of quality for Scorsese's future projects.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Complimenting the reference video is an equally reference audio track. While it's certainly lacking overall LFEs, I have to say I absolutely love what it does for general atmospherics and ambiance, regardless. Robbie Robertson's music supervision and use of pre-recorded compositions from various sources does a splendid job from the very beginning with the foghorn piece to string, brass, and other classical pieces played throughout. Dialogue is especially crisp with its varying amounts of indoor-voice, whisper, and scream volumes and never becomes muddled or lost in the music. Directionality of sound effects disperse themselves from the fronts and rears adding that extra sense of calm and craziness when need be in the form of screaming patients, storm noises outside the facility, metal doors slamming shut, waves washing ashore, birds chirping during the daytime, wind howling at night, the crackling of a fireplace in Dr. Cawley's study, and the dripping of water droplets within the silent tension of Ward C. Separation of said effects, music, and dialogue never bog one another down and really help to showcase the wonders of, yet, another commendable lossless track. While this probably won't hold up to the sound designs of modern day blockbusters, it was perfect enough for me and works very well with the subject matter of the plot.<br /><br />Extras - 3.0<br /><br />Shutter Island only comes with a mere 38 minutes of behind-the-scenes interviews from the cast, crew, author of the novel, and a mental health consultant. In the first vignette they explain bits and pieces of how the film came to fruition from book to movie, what Scorsese wanted to do with it, and a little bit of the actual filming process like set design and music. The second feature focuses more on the medical perspective and history of mental health from back in those days and talks about the transition that was occurring at the time, how the practice evolved between then and now, and the accuracy of how it's depicted within the film itself. While an audio commentary or a more in-depth look at how the movie was made would've been nice, the extras still provide a good deal of information about the story's themes and really helped me, personally, understand the kind of perseverance and dedication it takes to be a mental health professional. But given how fascinated I've recently become with Scorsese and his approach to film-making, I really wish Paramount had gone all out with a whole second disc of extras and one or two commentaries, at least. As much as I hate to double-dip, I actually wouldn't mind doing it for this, pending on what they might add.<br /><br />Overall - 4.5<br /><br />I took the film to be something more along the lines of a conspiracy thriller when I first saw the trailer, which it is in some fashion. But the big twist at the end really threw me in a loop and caught me by surprise. Some people may find this too "different" from the norm of Scorsese, but I found it quite refreshing and very entertaining at the same time. Shutter Island is certainly a mystery, but also a finely-crafted thriller that will more than likely have you duped the first time around. Thankfully, it has a lot of replay value and should make more sense a second or third time through. With reference A/V quality, though a much-to-be-desired set of extras, Shutter Island comes highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>'Shutter Island' is a suspenseful thriller that holds up to films such as 'The Sixth Sense'.  Of course, that should be the very least you get when you put a legendary director like Martin Scorsese on the job.  This is a film that will have you thinking and guessing even after you've left the theater.  An amazing mind trip that takes the viewer into the surreal labyrinthine hell that is Shutter Island in the eyes of  Edward "Teddy" Daniels, a U.S. Marshall investigating the strange disappearance of a patient at the Ashecliff Hospital for the criminally insane.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio is brilliant in the lead role of this film.  It is easily his best performance since 'The Aviator' in 2004.  His performance is one of the most down to earth, believable ones in recent memory.  When he emotes he doesn't downplay or exaggerate for the sake of the film.  He reacts in ways I could easily imagine a real person.  DiCaprio may not have starred in a movie nearly as successful as 'Titanic', but as far as acting is concerned he is 10x the actor he was in 1997.<br /><br />Scorsese is a genius.  That goes without saying it.  Martin Scorsese ranks up with the likes of Stanley Kubrick, Alfred Hitchcock, and Orson Welles as far as influence of cinematic techniques is concerned.  Some were disappointed by Shutter Island, saying that it doesn't live up to Scorsese's reputation.  I don't think there is anything wrong with the directing in this film.<br /><br />The decision of composer and Scorsese-collaborator Robbie Robertson and Scorsese to use only classical music for the film is very Stanley Kubrick, but it also works very well in Shutter Island.  Every piece of music manages to capture the scenes.  It is a marvel how they make these pieces almost seem as if they were written for the film.<br /><br />Make sure to give 'Shutter Island' two viewings, and don't let the first viewing define your view of the film.  You will learn most from the film after two viewings spread out over a period of time.  After seeing this movie for the second time, having thought over the first viewing for a period of six months, the film took on a new dimension of greatness.  Somethings become more clear, while others remain a mystery.<br /><br />Don't write this film off after one viewing.  If you do, you're missing out on the power of Scorsese's fresh masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>Shutter Island is a difficult film to review. The way the film unfolds is an interesting one, but is difficult to put into words without spoiling everything from the film. It strings you along so many different paths that guessing how the film ends is nearly impossible. While watching the film, however, nothing really made sense until the last twenty minutes or so. Between Teddy's hallucinations and what's transpiring on the island, it's almost exhausting trying to grasp what's actually happening in the film and what's occuring in Teddy's head. The finale to The Departed, another Martin Scorsese/ Leonardo DiCaprio pairing, was (and still is) one of the most talked about endings when it comes to recent films. Shutter Island doesn't necessarily top The Departed, but is along the same lines. Its ending gives new meaning to at least one repeat viewing of the film.<br /><br />There's no denying that I've been a fan of Martin Scorsese's films for quite some time. Films like Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Cape Fear, Casino, and Gangs of New York are prime examples of some of the best films ever. I can't say the same about Leonardo DiCaprio. While I can't argue the fact that I enjoy quite a few films he's been in, he didn't really do anything for me as an actor. I didn't see this potential or charisma that everyone else seemed to. Until now. His work in Shutter Island puts his acting skills on display for the world to see. His devastation towards the end of the film is not only believable, but absorbing as well.<br /><br />The cinematography is on a level you'd come to expect from a Scorsese picture. The way Ward C, the ward built during the Civil War that contains the island's most dangerous prisoners, is filmed in particular may be the high point as far as cinematography is concerned. The never-ending darkness makes you think something is going to jump out at you at any moment and its metal cage-like structure that constructs the walls feels claustrophobic; like you're a prisoner yourself. That "rat in a maze" line from the trailer really fits the film well. Everything in the lighthouse with the spiral staircase is pretty amazing, as well.<br /><br />An interesting note about the film is that the soundtrack is used sparingly. I didn't notice one throughout the majority of the film. It seemed to only be used during dramatic moments. There's also a gunshot towards the end of the film that is going to make you jump because it's so damn loud. Seriously. It's insane. For an R-rated Scorsese film, it seemed pretty mild in the language department. The F-word is said 422 times in Casino, 296 times in Goodfellas, and 237 times in The Departed while it's only said a handful of times in this film. Just seemed a bit odd for a Scorsese picture.<br /><br />Shutter Island is pretty confusing until the finale (basically from "Why are you all wet, baby?" to the end). It's pieced together slowly and is a combination of Teddy's memories, hallucinations, and what's actually occuring in reality. The way it unfolds is kind of like trying to solve a Rubix Cube. It takes time and a little bit of effort, but is well worth it in the end. Shutter Island is a film that makes you think. Remember that going in. Teddy has quite a few lines towards the end of the film that are going to stick with me for a very long time. It's a film that will only get better with repeat viewings. When it's all said and done, it was well worth waiting an extra four months for this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>It is in many ways a great film. It questions the "heritage" of the Second World War and the horror the American soldiers discovered in the camps, in this case here Dachau. It is also more than clear on the passage of some of the researchers of Nazi Germany to the US to continue their research in peace, including if necessary with human experiments when dealing with medical research. It is unluckily well-known that prisons and orphanages were places of hellish torturing and violence in the name of research or reform. That's the first level of the film. The second level is: what can society do with the few human beings who are so bad that they can't be reformed? Various solutions are available: lobotomizing them to turn them into docile pets, pharmaceuticalizing their cases so that they become chemical zombies, or manipulating their minds to make them convinced of what they have done and of the necessary punishment called treatment they are receiving. The film goes even as far as imagining the production of human killing tools that could be used in wars. Surgery, drugs or mental manipulation, that's the choices envisaged here. The three of them are all just fully wrong. But the film is a lot more disquieting than that if we deal with the simple fact that the decision of a psychiatrist to classify you as anything psychic or psychological is absolutely irreversible and everything you may say or do to prove you are not will be turned into the evidence that you are and will be used against you. In other words the lady always protests too much. That's the Kafka aspect of the tale. But the film is even better than all that because Scorsese in his personal style builds a story in which we do not know at all at the end if the two cops were really what they pretended to be at the beginning and thus were kidnapped by the doctors to make sure nothing will seep out of their concentration camp, or if it is the doctors who are right at the end and that the two cops are what these doctors pretend, one is a killer and the other his doctor and that the whole tale was a medical procedure to reach treatment. At the end there is only one choice left: to live as a monster or to die in dignity. But what is dignity in such an environment? We are happily doubting everything at the end, which may create a feeling of frustration in the audience.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>"Shutter Island" is a mystery with a twist, and I don't want to give it away.  So, I won't go into a lot of detail about the plot.  Leonardo DiCaprio and his partner travel to an institution for the criminally insane on an island, and nothing is as it seems.<br /><br />As my wife put it, about 60 minutes in, you know it's going down one of a few paths, all of which are cliches.  Sure enough, an hour and 15 minutes later, she was proved right.  The problem with the twist ending in the 21st century is that we've all seen a ton of movies with twist endings, and it has become harder and harder to actually surprise the audience.  Also as my wife put it, there's a good movie buried in here somewhere.  The characters are interesting; the idea of a mental hospital at the dawn of modern psychiatry is interesting; and the location is fantastic.  Strip away about 30 minutes from this languidly-paced film, do a few more drafts of the script, and this could be a winner.  The way Hollywood works, the remake/reimagining in 2030 will win an Oscar.<br /><br />On the plus side, DiCaprio turns in a tour de force performance, as usual.  The guy is a fantastic actor, and this is an actor's film.  If you like watching a great actor do amazing things with a character, you will enjoy this movie.<br /><br />At best, "Shutter Island" is worth a rent.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KW2KWKABNYNO.html">A2KW2KWKABNYNO</a><br/><p>Shutter Island is not a film I expected to like. A psychological thriller with touches of horror and jump scares? Boring. And it would be too in the hands of literally anybody else. Instead, we have Scorsese making moods like it's nobody's business & creating atmosphere while still balancing those pesky things called plots and characters. Leo makes good use of the accent and brings some humanity to an otherwise messed up man.<br /><br />Granted, one could only come to this conclusion after the end of the movie since the movie lives or dies by its 3rd act. Personally, I think they did a great job with it. It's unrealistic as all get out, but Scorsese sells you on it, and rest assured if you go back through the movie, it still mostly holds up with the twist. But here's the thing, without the twist, it would be a fairly generic and boring film, even if everything else was the same. The ending and the reveals/twists bring a quiet intensity to the proceedings which lead to some good emotional and dramatic moments, and somehow makes the rest of the film worth it.<br /><br />Overall, if you like a good Scorsese mood piece, then by all means watch this movie. It's not a brilliant movie, and we could debate the warrant of that ending all day long, but in the end, Shutter Island is pretty entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A29TKSIWA3JKF3.html">A29TKSIWA3JKF3</a><br/><p>I don't know what I was thinking; I am not a fan of Martin Scorsese, Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, or Michele Williams.  But, curiosity got the better of me, that, and so many misleading/glowing reviews posted here.  I just had to see what the fuss was all about.<br />I guess I should have read the negative reviews first.<br />All I can add is that I didn't absolutely hate it, but I saw nothing of real merit either.  It didn't engage me on any level.  I found it cold and detached from start to finish.  Everything about it was euphuistic: the grandiose score that never felt appropriate to the matter at hand, the mismatched acting styles that gave the BIG secret away, the intrusion of too many flashbacks (misleading clues), the dead slow pacing.....  Not to mention having to watch DiCaprio scowl/squint and misplace his accent for 137 minutes!<br />On an amusing note, the very qualities that people raved about were the very qualities that irritated me.  I found them more gimmicky than artistic.  Which brings this down to a matter of taste.  I can guarantee you'll either love it or hate it, or like me, not be moved to have any deep feelings for it.<br />I will add that I'm not sorry I watched it and didn't feel it was a waste of my time.  But, I have absolutely no interest in watching it again.  Not a keeper.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>Look guys, I do get it. The film is a study of insanity before a thriller/horror. Doesn't make it good. Furthermore, if you read the book you'd see my point.<br /><br />I read the book nearly a year before the film got released and I loved it. Quite possibly the most edge-of-your-seat book I read in a long time!!!! Furthermore when I saw the trailer and heard Scorsese would be doing the film adaptation I got ecstatic. Scorsese is one of the best filmmakers, and he directed my favorite film of 2006- The Departed. That movie was just spectacular, and it changed the way I saw movies forever. It blew my then-teenage mind, and I'll never forget the first time I saw it.<br /><br />So could tell, I was excited, and flocking to the theatre on opening day, I was ready to place this at the top of my list.<br /><br />The film is true to the book, yes. Is that a good thing? It depends. I was happy they stuck with the book, as basically it seemed like they used the book as the film's screenplay.<br /><br />However, I have the feeling that this would be a one star review if I hadn't read the book. For one, even my girlfriend, who hadn't read the book, knew the ending about 10 minutes in. The plot worked well in the book, but as a movie, just simply fails, again showing that not all books that are great make good movies. The movie is pretty alright, as it is lush and colorful in a few scenes and at times even seems like a gothic horror film.  Again, pretty pictures does not equal good movie.<br /><br />Another thing ruining the film is its "punch in the face" musical score. Come on, the score was ridiculous. Spooky tingling piano music!!! Nazi-marching-into-town-music!!! LOUD BRASS music!!! Whoever did the score needs a kick in the teeth. The murder scene near the end was hilarious due to the inappropriate spooky tingling piano music.<br /><br />In short, honestly this film is pointless. I love Scorsese but this film just doesn't do anything for me. Skip it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>I actually watched Shutter Island twice this past weekend. Wait, that's not 100% accurate. The first time I watched it I kept falling asleep; at one point I think I was out for a good 20 minutes. So I watched it again in the daytime on Sunday, and it turns out the movie wasn't quite as bad as me falling asleep might have made it sound.<br /><br />After a clear-minded viewing (versus my original attempt after an exhaustingly long week and a couple of beers), I can say that Shutter Island had some decent moments. I don't know why but even in the first few moments of my initial viewing, something seemed very familiar about the movie. I already knew what the twist was going to be. I mean, I didn't predict all of the intricacies leading up to the twist, but I knew...I just knew!...where we'd end up when the final minute of the long 2 hours plus of a movie's credits rolled.<br /><br />I'm telling ya, I saw a Twilight Zone, Outer Limits or SOMETHING that had the exact same kind of twist...I just can't put my finger on it. There are great movies with great twists all the time (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BRZ5J2">The Sixth Sense</a>) that catch me totally off guard at the end, but Shutter Island just didn't.<br /><br />Making matters worse was a storyline that you really have to take with a grain of salt and give the benefit of the doubt to. Not that the trauma of Shutter Island's 67th patient wasn't indeed traumatic. It's just I had a hard time swallowing the whole idea that such an elaborate scheme could be pulled off. I guess that in a perfect world (poor choice of words for a place like Shutter Island) it could happen, but boy did the stars have to line up perfectly.<br /><br />What the film lacked in believability and 'keeping it simple' (and short), it made up for in atmosphere. I don't know about everyone else, but Director Martin Scorsese made me feel like I was on Shutter Island and that was a creepy, helpless feeling; the movie gets an extra star for that. Scorsese created a living, breathing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401204252">Arkham Asylum</a> where the only things missing were the most notorious villains and the Caped Crusader himself. When did the nuts take over the nuthouse?<br /><br />Oh, and a final word on the acting: great. If you like a psychological thriller and you have a lot of patience, you'll probably like Shutter Island, so move on to the 4 or 5 star reviews for advice that's probably more in line with how Shutter Island will affect you. I think 2+ hours was a long time to get to the point, and I could have used a little more action and suspense to get me to the end...in a conscious state.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>Based on Dennis Lehane's novel, Shutter Island works well as a claustrophobic experience, mystery, and physiological thriller. Scorsese does a superb job of creating an unsettling, Gothic mood, with a music score that adds tension and effective, creepy imagery of the island. There's a deliberate slow moving pace to the film, but I think this works well to build tension and lead up to the dramatic conclusion. Some may guess the ending, or at least have clues where it is heading before it reaches the film's final minutes, but, nonetheless Shutter Island is a great film, a successful, stellar adaptation of the novel. The cast particularly shines, especially Leonardo DiCaprio, who turns in an excellent performance, giving depth to his role as Teddy Daniels. Ben Kingsley also does a superb job as the institution's Dr. Cawley.<br /><br />Teddy Daniels arrives to Shutter Island with his partner to unravel the mysterious disappearance of one of its patients, Rachel Solando. As Teddy and Chuck explore the institution, and find out about Rachel and its inmates. However, Teddy learns more about the mystery and the institution, flashbacks and visions begin to surface that further complicate the plot.<br />Shutter Island begins with one mystery only to add on another mystery that needs to be accounted for. There are several layers of twists, but these are revealed in fragmented pieces that we put together.<br /><br />As far as editions to the film, I'd stick with the blu-ray over this edition, as the blu-ray has two featurettes about the film: Behind the Shutters and Into the Lighthouse. The quality is a bit sharper as well.<br /><br />Over all, Shutter Island is quite an effective, atmospheric experience and, as one reviewer noted, a film that you can view multiple time to pick up clues and meanings. Creepy and weird, but in a good way. Definitely one of Scorsese's best.<br /><br />4 1/2 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A3T0OTH5072YRE.html">A3T0OTH5072YRE</a><br/><p>I had only seen small previews of this movie and had never really paid attention to it or had an interest in seeing it.  However, when it was on the discount rack at the local movie store I decided to give it a try.  Directed by Martin Scorsese it should have been a good movie.  And while it wasn't too bad, I'd rate it a high average compared to some of his other excellent works.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, an FBI agent who has been sent to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of one of the inmate/patients there.  You see, Shutter Island is home to the Ashecliff hospital for the criminally insane.  Most of the people sent there never leave and are too dangerous to hold near the general population.  In fact, the woman who disappeared is accused of murdering her three children by drowning them in the lake.  His partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) is along to help him solve the case.  The problem is, things keep going from bad to worse when they start suspecting that no one wants this case solved after all.  Not a single person is being helpful and Daniels starts to suspect that the head psychiatrist (Ben Kingsley) is out to make sure he never leaves the island and expose their deadly secret.<br /><br />There is a lighthouse on the island and this is where Daniels thinks they are doing horrific experiments.  The head psychiatrist Dr. Cawley claims they only use medicine and therapy, but Daniels believes they are doing lobotomies in this horrible place as well.  He is determined to get to the bottom of it even though when the missing woman is found there is no reason for him to stay on the island.  However, strange things keep happening to Daniels (his dead wife keeps haunting his dreams) and he can only hope he won't fall into the madness that is Shutter Island.<br /><br />DiCaprio does a good job in this movie.  He's believable and while he does come on as an incompetent character sometimes (only because he couldn't hear me screaming at him to get out of there!) he plays a pretty deep complex character and does fair job of getting the nuances just right. As a whole I'm not a big fan of DiCaprio as I think its too easy to remember his previous films when he's acting and that can be mildly distracting. His partner doesn't have much of a part aside from a few side things so I didn't really feel I had enough background to critique his part in the movie.  Kingsley is always fantastic and it was great that he easily made the watcher suspicious of him from the get go.<br /><br />There was quite a bit of music in this movie and it does have an impressive score.  That said, it wasn't my type of music and therefore wasn't very memorable for me.  The genre of the music was mainly classical.<br /><br />An interesting premise. but it can be quite predictable at time.  Because of this I really didn't feel surprise at the end and some of the scenes in the movie could get quite boring as they were trying to build story without anything happening.  Definitely three stars, it wasn't bad but it wasn't excellent either.  I did enjoy the locale of the movie as well, it was hauntingly beautiful.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2010</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>A tale that is rampant in themes of madness.  The main character begins an investigation on an island asylum only to find out that things are more complicated than suspected.  I don't want to give the big moment away so I will just leave it at that.  The "Aha!" moment was done somewhat well but not well enough to get it four stars.  These type of movie focuses are very tough to do, though, so I admire the attempt by director Scorsese and the twenty other billion people who make a movie happen. :)  MY GRADE: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: 07/06/2010.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>Great cast and great direction.  The problem is that I figured out the big twist 10 minutes into a 2+ hour film.  I had hoped that maybe it was a big swerve and the ending would change things up since it seemed so obvious, but that didn't happen.  I do like Scorsese's direction and the score reminded me of "The Shining".  I can't fault much with the film other than the story itself.  Well made movie, just a bit of a let down for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>The date is 1954. A patient is missing from an asylum (Ashcliff). Yet it seems impossible. So ex World War 11 soldier, now U.S. Martial is sent to investigate. What he finds or does not find on the island of secretive people will intrigues us as the story mores into much more than a simple investigation.<br /><br />If the Dr. Caligari story had not been done repeatedly so many times over the years, this film may have been surprising and more enjoyable. As with all hybrids, there were some tossed in dashes of "The Manchurian Candidate" (1962), "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (1956) and maybe the kitchen sink for good measure and voila. Does Marin Scorsese think no one goes to the movies? He cannot be that naive. At least the actors (well known) were really acting and not walking through the script. Leonardo DiCaprio is believable as Teddy Daniels. The music is also a character and does not overwhelm the dialog. A nice touch was any blood looked more like theatrical makeup so it did not overwhelm the story.<br /><br />I only saw the Blu-ray version so I cannot compare to others.<br /><br />I have to admit that I have not read the book yet.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GAH9YI">The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Enhanced) 1920</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000066AXE">A Beautiful Mind (Full Screen Awards Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767821629">The Thirteenth Floor</a></p></br><a href="../users/AOXL514GEE4AA.html">AOXL514GEE4AA</a><br/><p>Scorcese excels in another wonderful character driven piece. Based on a novel, the story takes place in 1954. DiCaprio plays U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels, and he does so convincingly. Teddy is assigned to investigate the disappearance of a patient from Boston's Shutter Island Hospital for the criminally insane. As he starts to dig deeper and deeper into the case, he begins to wonder if somehow he is part of a much larger and twisted plot. Teddy quickly realizes that he must solve this case and get off the island before he loses his own "sanity".<br /><br />This movie really deserves 4.5 stars. Scorcese is such a master of building a "real" world in his fims. You feel like it's 1954 from wardrobe to attitude. The acting in this film is wonderful! DiCaprio's range is incredible, which makes him a great actor. We will be watching Leo for decades to come. I will not spoil the movie in my review (I never do), but like the box says "it deserves multiple viewings". That is because once the mystery is revealed, you will want to watch the movie from a different perspective. An excellent film!<br /><br />BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Paramount really does a nice job here. The colors are toned down to reflect not only the time, but the mood of the island and hospital. The pictures still remains crisp and every detail is captured to immerse you into the environment. The audio mix is good. SPECIAL FEATURES: Not much here, but the 2 featurettes included are great! After watching the movie, spend the extra 20 minutes to watch them. FINAL THOUGHTS: A MUST OWN!</p></br><a href="../users/A2JP0URFHXP6DO.html">A2JP0URFHXP6DO</a><br/><p>In 1954, U.S. Marshal Edward "Teddy" Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), go to the Ashecliff Hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island. They are assigned there to investigate the disappearance of a female patient who apparently disappeared from a locked room. The chief psychiatrist Dr. John Cawley (Ben Kingsley), explains that she was committed after drowning her three children.<br /><br />The Marshals run up against one wall after another in their investigation including the refusal by Cawley to turn over patient files and a generally uncooperative staff that includes Max Von Sydow as Dr. Naehring, another psychiatrist.  Daniels and Naehring quickly form an intense dislike of one another as Naehring is German and Daniels was part of a U.S. Army battalion that liberated the infamous Dachau Death Camp during World War II.  As a storm prevents the Marshals from returning to the mainland, Teddy begins to lose a grip on his own reality, having flashbacks to the horrific images at the death camp and suffering debilitating headaches.  He is determined to get to the island's lighthouse, convinced that it may hold the key to the mystery despite having been told that the guards have already searched it.  The mystery only deepens when the escaped patient is miraculously found.<br /><br />Directed by Martin Scorsese, Shutter Island is based on Dennis Lehane's 2003 novel of the same name.  Lehane also wrote Mystic River and Gone, Baby Gone, which has some of the same elements as Shutter Island.  What strikes you first is the amazing visuals and the foreboding atmosphere of Ashecliff.  Built atop the rocky island off Boston, part of the facility had formerly been used as a fort during the Civil War.  It hints of the gothic castles and mansion from old Universal Studios horror films.  The island quakes with thunder and lightning, jolting you off the comfy confines of your sofa.<br /><br />Scorsese positions Cawley and Naehring as sinister forces, purposely keeping the Marshals at bay to deep their dark secrets hidden.  Daniels and Aule soon theorize that the facility might have a more ominous purpose.  The pair scurry about like rats in a maze, checking every corner but making little progress in their investigation.<br /><br />Scorsese indulges himself a little too much with the scenery, liberally borrowing bits from noir films and even cannibalizing some of his own films like Cape Fear.  The many flashbacks to Daniels' experiences during the war only serve to reveal Scorsese's hole card much too soon.  About halfway through the film you think there's no way that it can be going down THIS path with a twist that has been done all too frequently in other recent thriller/horror films.  Despite this near fatal flaw, Scorsese manages to pull it all together in the end.<br /><br />DiCaprio gives a solid performance, even if he does look silly in his fedora.  You can feel his growing unease every step of the way. The show stealer is Kingsley whose character combines equal parts creepy and campy.  The fine supporting cast includes Jackie Earle Haley, Patricia Clarkson, and Ted Levine.<br /><br />Despite some of its flaws, Shutter Island is a worthwhile view thanks to its nightmarish imagery and strong performances.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I thought was movie was alright. I didn't love it, yet I didn't hate it. One thing I loved was that it took place during the 1950's, because that's my favorite era. I also loved all the gothic dream sequences, and the look of the film. It gets a little confusing toward the end. DiCaprio plays a U.S. Marshal named Teddy Daniels, and Ruffalo plays his partner named Chuck Aule. They are investigating the disappearance of a woman named Rachel Solando at an asylum for the criminally insane. Due to bad weather, Teddy and Chuck are stuck on the island, and must deal with the crazy inmates. and Teddy is forced to face his demons.

The story really drew me in and even though I figured out the final twist early on (it's somewhat obvious and it's a BIG one), I didn't know how it would get to that point and why.<br /><br />The acting is terrific by everyone. Leonardo DiCaprio gets better and better with each passing film. Just look how far he has progressed since his weak turn in Gangs of New York (or maybe it was just Daniel Day-Lewis stealing his thunder). Ben Kingsley is always fascinating to watch and all the other big names in roles large and small put forth very good efforts, from Mark Ruffalo, Max von Sydow, Patricia Clarkson, Ted Levine, Emily Mortimer, Michelle Williams, all the way to Jackie Earle Haley.<br /><br />Martin Scorsese is considered by most to be one of the finest directors to ever live, and while Shutter Island is better than his average works like Cape Fear or Bringing Out the Dead, it's not one of his best. Still, you can't deny his visual style, the atmosphere he can create, or the way he can capture the inner torment of one's soul (by using some really freaky dream sequences in this case).<br /><br />Now, on the slightly negative side. I think I would have liked it even more had it not reminded so much of David Fincher's film, The Game. If you haven't seen that movie, you will probably have your mind blown with this one.<br /><br />Shutter Island is not flawless in any sense, but it's a well crafted mystery with plenty of chills. Now, what idiot moved this film's release date from the month of Halloween to February? I guess SAW VI had them running for cover. What a sad statement that is.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>Martin Scorsese's "Shutter Island" is not an easy film to define. It's simplest to say that it's an experience - suspenseful, taut, brooding, mysterious, and engrossing from the moment the first shot appears, in which a ferry emerges from a veil of dense fog. A story that begins with something emerging from nothing is a very telling sign of what lies ahead, because in that moment, you're forced to ask yourself what lies beyond the veil in both directions. We're told that that ferry set sail from the mainland, specifically Boston, although we never actually see it. For all we know, the boat might have been spawned from the sea. Within the veil lies the titular island, on which sits a former Civil War fort that has been converted into a mental institution for the criminally insane.<br /><br />The fort looms off in the distance like a harbinger of doom, surrounded by nothing but open water and gray skies becoming heavy with rain. Approaching it by boat are two U.S. federal marshals: Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo). Their story takes place in the year 1954, when they're assigned to a case involving the disappearance of a Shutter Island inmate. Once they arrive, they meet the institution's chief physician, Dr. John Cawley (Ben Kingsley), a calm and collected man who has an air of knowing more than he lets on. Everyone on the island comes off the same way - the doctors, the orderlies, the nurses, the security staff, even the patients all seem to be hiding something.<br /><br />The missing inmate is Rachel Solando, who drowned her own children and, according to Dr. Cawley, has deluded herself into believing that she's still in her home and that all the patients and staff members are her neighbors. Her disappearance, Teddy and Chuck quickly realize, makes absolutely no sense. Her cell was locked. Her window was bared. She would have had to pass a number of people to exit the compound. The island's botanical and geographic configurations wouldn't allow her to travel by foot, especially since she's presumed to have no shoes. She couldn't have fallen off a cliff and drowned, for her body would have already washed up on shore. The weather alone, indicative of an approaching hurricane, would have stopped her. Everything about this woman's situation is impossible.<br /><br />As the mystery of Rachel Solando deepens, so too does the mystery of Teddy Daniels, who seems lost within his own painful past. In due time, bizarre visions and frightening dreams seem to merge with his desperate need to find the truth. Sometimes, this involves his dead wife, Dolores (Michelle Williams), while at other times it involves memories of liberating a Nazi concentration camp during his last days in World War II. For both himself and the audience, reality becomes less and less definable, pretty much to the point where you no longer believe your own eyes. Clues lead to outlandish discoveries, which in turn lead to more questions. Everything is open to interpretation.<br /><br />What, for example, is Teddy to make of a note found under a floorboard in Rachel's cell? What about an encounter he has in Ward C, a place reserved for only the most dangerous of inmates? It's here he's forced to roam gloomy stone corridors with nothing but matches to light his way, which is to say he's seeing things only in fragments. What is he to make of Dr. Cawley's colleague, Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow), a German immigrant who asks the most sinister of questions? What goes on inside a lighthouse seen off in the distance? And what of Rachel herself? Has she truly escaped, or is she still somewhere on Shutter Island?<br /><br />What makes this movie brilliant is that it isn't really about the plot, nor is it about the ending, which on all rational levels is utterly preposterous. The film's purpose, as I understand it, is to take the audience on a purely emotional journey, to consistently evoke feelings of uncertainty and terror as the dark recesses of the mind are explored. Relying heavily on the conventions of film noir, where heroes are troubled souls and shadows conceal all kinds of secrets, Scorsese doesn't tell a story so much as establish mood for just over two hours. When it comes to the mind, whatever form that may take, story is inconsequential; we can go in just about any direction and wind up just about anywhere.<br /><br />Which brings me back to the ending. It may seem like a typical Hollywood plot twist, but it offers no real payoff, and that's because the reality of everything leading up to it is in doubt. If we can't trust the beginning and middle sections, how on earth can we trust the end? I don't think we should even try. "Shutter Island" is not about a logical sequence of events or a mechanical resolution. It's about keeping audiences in a perpetual state of confusion and apprehension (as Teddy Daniels seems to be) through the talents of the cast and filmmakers. When it was over, I thought not about the technical details or the narrative trickery, but about the overall effect it had on me. It played its game, and I wanted to play right along with it. What a captivating movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ST1XBL6EQTBV.html">A1ST1XBL6EQTBV</a><br/><p>I rented this film the other night and though I wouldn't call it a bad movie<br />necessarily, I will say that it took the long route to get to the point!<br />They could've easily shaved off 20 to 25 minutes of this film,<br />tightened up the storyline and overall flow, and then I would've<br />said  "ANOTHER BRILLIANT SCORSESE MASTERPIECE!!"...but alas, I can't<br />call this one masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. (-:<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, Martin Scorsese is a true genius, a master<br />storyteller, and an icon of cinema whose work will be discussed and<br />studied for as long as there are people on earth who watch movies!<br />He has given us some truly brilliant films over the years, acted by some<br />of the most brilliant actors of our times...mainly one Robert DeNiro and<br />as of late, his new muse for the last few films, Leonardo DiCaprio,<br />who is cut from the same cloth of artistic excellence and total commitment<br />to whatever his current role requires.<br />But I'm a fan of Scorsese's more straight ahead masterworks like<br />"Taxi Driver", "Raging Bull", "King Of Comedy", "Casino" and of course,<br />"Goodfellas", which is argubly one of his best!<br />His films are always multi-layered, deep, well-developed, well-acted, etc.<br />even when they are straight ahead stories which everybody can follow and<br />get right into away. Even with those films, every time you watch them,<br />you catch a subtle nuance that you missed before that makes you like it even more.<br /><br />But as of his last few films, mainly "The Departed" as well as<br />"Shutter Island", I think he is taking the multi-dimensional thing a<br />bit too far and getting a little too cryptic for his own good!<br />Just my opinion. (Though I later came to appreciate "The Departed"<br />more with time and 3 or 4 viewings.)<br />To me, there is just too much going on in this story that,<br />by the time it all comes together in the end, it isn't as much a<br />surprise as it was a bit of a relief that the mental rollercoaster ride is over!<br />Yes, yes, I know...it's supposed to be a mind-boinking of sorts,<br />but it could've done it and brought us all to the money shot in<br />much less time than it did!<br />Having said that, I completely bought Leo DiCaprio's, Mark Ruffalo's<br />and Sir Ben Kinsley's performances hook line & sinker, and applaud them<br />for what they brought to it. There are some stunning visual sequences<br />as well, but the cinematography is usually always on point in a Scorsese film.<br />I must say though, that I'm much more happier that I rented it instead of<br />buying it just on the strength of Martin Scorsese's reputation.<br />(That's what happened when I bought "The Departed")<br />Again, I would hardly say this was a masterpiece, but it's<br />interesting enough to watch at least twice, then if you want to buy it for<br />your home DVD collection, then that's on you!

"Shutter Island" has the makings of a good thriller but never gets off the ground. The plot is good, the cast is great, and the cinematography is super cool. But everything else is just downright stupid: not scary, not creepy, and super obvious. I felt like Scorsese was dumbing down to his audience the whole time. The trailers for this film were much better than the actual movie. Skip this one.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>I've loved Martin Scorsese ever since watching BOXCAR BERTHA in the theatre as a kid. I've especially enjoyed his gangster films (GOODFELLAS, CASINO, DEPARTED), also TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL, and CAPE FEAR. However, deep down, I'm a horror / thriller fanatic, so SHUTTER ISLAND came as a wonderful surprise! From the outset, the entire atmosphere is gloomy and full of dread. The characters are interesting, and the story is dark. Leonardo DiCaprio is perfectly suited for the twists, turns, and shocks involved. If you love suspense, mystery, and thrills, then SHUTTER ISLAND should flip your lid!...</p></br><a href="../users/AJLYAY1G5Z8GE.html">AJLYAY1G5Z8GE</a><br/><p>Superb!!<br /><br />First half of the movie is slow, dark, and many times boring.

Guaranteed.<br /><br />Its the kind of movie that you will want to watch all over again to check all the little details and clues that make the final conclusion make sense.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>I didn't know what to expect on Shutter Island, the movie's title is sort of off-putting and I thought it was going to be a relitively cheesey pocorn movie.  Then I realize it's directed by Martin Scorsese at the last minute and I enjoy most of his films.  If Shutter Island were directed by anyone else, it potentially could have went into another realm and direction and collapse from within.  I loved Leo Di Caprio in The Aviator and Titanic so he's gained my approval as a decent actor who really commits himself into the roles he's playing.  I was a bit apprehensive when I first heard the east coast accent he devolped for this role and I thought to myself, "am I going to have to listen to this crap all night?"  But then it seamlessly blends into his character and it just becomes him, which is quite impressive.  There is also something attractive about him that I can't quite put my finger on.  There's this subtle sexual undertone thing going on with him and I don't know if it's because I'm sexually atracted to him or if it's just because he's aging well and looks more handsome now.  This has nothing to do with the movie but it can influence your oppinions about his acting and the film itself.  Actually that's not true because I think Russel Crow is hot but I hate all of his movies, he's a crap actor. Never mind, I'm sorry.  I'm off on a strange tangent.  I enjoyed the intersting story in Shutter Island and it does throw you for a loop at the end when u find out that Leo is actually a patient at the facility.  It's sort of in the same vein as the ending in Nicole Kidman's "The Others" (another great movie).  It's very Twilight Zone-ish and creeps you out.  Shutter Island is the first movie I've seen this year that's actually entertained me.  Good movies are hard to find these days, just like men.  I wonder if Leo Di Caprio's single?  Hmmm......</p></br><a href="../users/A120GIT50UISJP.html">A120GIT50UISJP</a><br/><p>Hard-drinking, migraine-suffering US Marshall Teddy Daniels is called out to Shutter Island when a violent criminal escapes from the mental hospital on the island. Teddy has problems; his memories of WW2 haunt him, as does the death of his wife in an apartment fire. He struggles to keep it together, as he wonders, privately, if he doesn't belong in a mental hospital himself. Teddy and his partner have to sift out the truth from fantasy as they interview the patients. But there is a common theme--the inmates are terrified, and there is a mysterious 67th patient who no one seems to know anything about. As they are drawn deeper into the asylum, toward Cell C, for the most violent patients, Teddy's grasp on reality slips further and further away.<br /><br />The character of Teddy is excellently played by Leonard DiCaprio; we feel his pain at his wife's death, share his trauma from the war; the dream scenes are particularly bittersweet and heartrending. And we get a glimpse into the horrors that passed as "medical treatment" in the 1950's.<br /><br />Shutter Island will constantly keep you guessing--what is real? What is sanity? How should the mental ill be treated? It is a thought-provoking and emotionally wrenching story that will stay with you for a long time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>It wasn't terribly challenging to figure out where this film was going.  Don't be deterred, though.  It was nicely creepy and evenly dramatic.  DiCaprio and Ruffalo were a great team.  The story flowed well and drew the audience in.  Parts of it were a bit far-fetched, and tempering those may have contributed to a better, less obvious ending.  The story gets a bit convoluted, and as a result its enigmatic ending just comes out muddy.  If you like mysteries, it's an interesting story, just not a terribly mysterious one...</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Shutter Island directed by Martin Scorsese is a very ambitious film but kind of boring as well. Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo, Michelle Williams, and Ben Kingsley round out the talented cast but even their acting chops can't save this psychological film from barely staying above float. The film doesn't really get interesting until the last 45 minutes - very disturbing and hard to watch but that's the only section of this film that grabbed my attention. So-so thriller, a mixed bag for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />I have to liken 'Shutter Island' to another mystery-thriller: 'The Sixth Sense'. Both have a myriad of clues planted throughout the narrative, leading to a highly entertaining twist ending. I'll confess that I was pretty much fooled up until the climax but I did have my suspicions that things couldn't be what they seemed. At first, it seems that 'Shutter Island' is going to be a tale about some evil psychiatrists (aided and abetted by a corrupt staff) who are conducting secret experiments on a hapless population of psychiatric patients. Dr. Cawley (perfectly played by Ben Kingsley) does everything he can to stymie Federal Marshall Teddy Daniel's investigation including his refusal to hand over staff personnel folders. Before you know it, there are rumors that lobotomies are being performed at the lighthouse, on a different part of the island.<br /><br />I became quite confused after the hurricane when Teddy and his partner Chuck (later revealed to be psychiatrist, Dr. Sheehan) are so easily able to walk into Ward C, where the most dangerous patients are housed. After all, if this was where all the really bad things were happening, wouldn't Cawley and his guards make it a point to prevent Teddy from learning Ward C's dark secrets? My best reasoning held that the marshals were able to slip into the off-limits area due to the confusion in the aftermath of the storm. But it didn't look right; the guards supposedly knew who Teddy was and they were simply letting him casually walk into the house of horrors where he does in fact learn that patients are being mistreated (i.e. lobotomized).<br /><br />Was this simply an example of poor screen writing or was something more sinister afoot? As it turns out, Teddy's beliefs that everyone was out to get him on Shutter Island, was simply a paranoid fantasy. In fact, Teddy's 'investigation' was simply an elaborate role-play set up by Dr. Cawley, designed to break down Teddy's defenses. The ubiquitous Rachel Solando, who supposedly murdered her three children, was one of Dr. Cawley's staff members, pretending that she was a murderer in order to help Teddy realize that it was actually he who had murdered his wife after discovering that she had murdered their three children.<br /><br />Because all of this calls for a great suspension of disbelief, Shutter Island ranks up there as a solid piece of film entertainment but holds it back from being considered a true 'artistic masterpiece' (as some have argued it is). There are three big problems with the film's narrative.<br /><br />Firstly, there's a big assumption here that such role-playing could ever lead to such a huge improvement in a paranoid schizophrenic's psyche. Cawley and Sheehan concede that the role-playing can lead to a regression (as it did with Teddy nine months earlier, as they candidly admit). They call it a new "experimental therapy" but role-playing has been around for centuries. It looks awful nice how they get Teddy to confront his demons, but I would think that role-playing (as it's shown here) would tend to aggravate the patient, much more than it would lead to any kind of meaningful revelations.<br /><br />That leads to the second problem: why would the Board of Overseers countenance such a therapy? After all, those are the guys who approve the lobotomies at the slightest hint of violence amongst the mentally ill population. Back in 1954, lobotomies were actually believed to be helpful for patients. Why would such do-gooders, such as Cawley and Sheehan, be given the chance to turn Teddy around? Not only don't I believe such people would be in charge of a Federal lock-up for the criminally insane but even if they were, they would not be allowed to conduct such a role-play experiment.<br /><br />In reality such an experiment would place both the staff and the prison population in jeopardy. In a ridiculous scene, after Teddy bursts into the lighthouse, Cawley asks him, 'did you hurt the guard very badly?' In real life, he would never have been allowed to put any of the guards in jeopardy. Just imagine if Teddy actually had killed the guard by slugging him over the head with the rifle? And would Dr. Cawley allow his expensive European convertible to go up in smoke just to help the most dangerous patient on Stutter Island--simply out of the goodness of his heart?. I know he's a liberal but no one's that liberal when it comes to their own property that's worth so much money.<br /><br />So without the role-play taking place, there's no twist ending and no accolades for Dennis Lehane, the author of the novel along with Director Martin Scorsese. Nonetheless, there's much to admire about this picture. Scorsese has a terrific way with camera angles. I love all the subtle closeups such as when the Dachau Commandant reaches for his gun, as he lays wounded in his office along with the old Victrola, with the record playing over and over. Scorsese sometimes overdoes things, especially with those scenes involving the murdered children at the end of the film (just a little too much blood for my tastes). All the performances are quite good here including Kingsley (as noted earlier) along with a very cool Max Von Sydow (who at first glance is supposed to be the bad guy but on second viewing, is quite benign).<br /><br />Scorsese also smartly added the ambiguous line at the end suggesting that Teddy is cured but pretends to be insane since he can no longer live with the guilt of failing to save his children at the hands of his murderous wife.<br /><br />This is the type of picture worth watching twice. The first time around you'll be in the dark; the second time you'll watch it for all the clues missed. But after that, there are no profound ideas here to sift through. In other words, an Ingmar Bergman film it ain't! But as a solid entertainment--it hits the mark!</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>The plot is interesting at first and the first one hour fifteen will have you hooked. Di Caprio is good at first but soon you will find the movie goes into a very sketchy study of schizophrenia, war, guns, dark walls, island, revenge and disappearing acts in 1954.<br /><br />Let's talk about the director. Having done just about every sort of classic, Martin Scorsese seems to have made Shutter Island as a homage to Kubrick and Hitchcock. I read somewhere that this is a bit like a modern day shining. I beg to differ, The Shining had a good story while Shutter Island tries very hard to confuse and make sense at the same time. Some people might have even guessed the mystery, some people like me would have waited till the last scene only to be told something that would make sense but still seem a little lofty.<br /><br />Leonardo is Martin's favourite actor without a doubt. They have always made a great team but with Shutter Island, I found myself a little disappointed because it left me feeling a little robbed of a worthy end. The climax leaves too many things unanswered. I fear this movie is terribly slow and difficult to be watched at home so I'm glad I went to the movies. BEWARE of the loud pangs of horns and music that will hit you time and again, every time an ocean shot is shown.<br /><br />Gandhi, I'm sorry, Sir Ben Kingseley was a relief with a very clean little important role. The names will confuse you no end. Mark Ruffalo has done better films but I found his character quite meak though he gave it his best shot. From start to finish, the film centers around Di Caprio. He's in every single scene.<br /><br />What I liked about this film is how despite being slow it holds you by the end of your brain's wits. You will forget your life for that 2 hours and 30 minutes, you will switch your blackberry off and not want to speak a word to anyone. That disconnect truly highlights Scorsese's great potential for drama.<br /><br />This film is definitely beyond the attention span of my generation.</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>SHUTTER ISLAND, the Martin Scorsese film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, is one picture I really wanted to like but didn't. I just couldn't.  SHUTTER ISLAND is slow, pretentious, stilted, and clich&eacute;. The ending is worthy of M. Night Shamylan on a very bad day (which is saying a lot considering his many failures.) But maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me start at the beginning.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio plays a US Marshall who is headed to SHUTTER ISLAND to find out what happened to an escaped mental patient. There he meets Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow who are the scientists in charge of the place. After several CGI flashbacks, we learn that DiCaprio's character was a witness to the infamous "Dachau Massacre." You'll realize, after the movie is over, that this has no bearing whatsoever on the movie, despite a good amount of time being spent on it. (The film's account of the incident also seems to be at odds with the contemporary history.) We also learn, through flashback and clumsy exposition, that he is on SHUTTER ISLAND for a very personal reason - to find the man that killed his wife, whom he still sees in visions. So we have maximum security mental hospital on a secluded island with only one way off. Did I mention they are in the middle of a hurricane? And all their electricity goes out? And the crazies escape? And there's a horde of rats? And... And none of that even matters to the movie, but it's all in there. There are secret messages, warnings, crazies who seem sane, the obligatory shock therapy and frontal lobotomies, and an ending that for the life of me I believe was tacked on at the last minute just because. It's as though they took elements from several movies and soldered them together. It just doesn't work.<br /><br />All-in-all, I cannot recommend SHUTTER ISLAND.  There are many better movies for each of the genres that this film tries to represent. Here's a sample:<br /><br />-  Mental Health: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest<br />-  1950's Crime Drama: L.A. Confidential<br />-  Stuck on an Island: And Then There Were None<br />-  I See Dead People: Sixth Sense<br />-  Escaping from a Prison on an Island: Escape From Alcatraz<br /><br />For a much more entertaining evening, watch one of these instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A1845IJB63D5H7.html">A1845IJB63D5H7</a><br/><p>The narration of "Shutter Island" avoided the pitfall of the style of News-telling, such as the movie "Brothers".  Both movies shared the same theme of post-traumatic stress syndrome overlapping psychosis. The affected person could not suppress his grossly traumatized mind. His reality is distorted with persisting illusion and delusions. In Brothers, the viewer was told the News simultaneously from both sides of two diverse worlds, with nothing left for the viewer to predict or ponder.  As such, Brothers portrayed unreal, sanitized, and shallow scenarios.<br /><br /> In Shutter Island, the viewer lives with the mind of the inflicted person whose delusions led him to distort persons, time, and space, as his mind overwhelmed with unbearable trauma. The health-care taker is perceived by the traumatized patient as a fellow employee form the past work, as Federal Marshal. His incarceration in the mental asylum is perceived as mission to free the oppressed. His reality is a twilight saga occupied by his belated wife and children who were killed in mysterious circumstances. The traumatized patient is haunted by the people he killed or lost, both in his dreams and wakefulness. Once, he perceives those as being burnt in accidental fire, where his role was to pursue the culprit. Another, he sees his wife drowning his children and accidentally had to shot her out of his shock and loss. As his mind fragments, his health-care takers could not make as sense of any scenario he was telling.<br /><br /> The greatest strength of the movie was conveying the real experience of dealing with psychotic patients.  The patient is sharp and defensive in some brief moments and quickly relapses into delusional thoughts as his fragmented mind is flooded with painful imagery and emotions. Due to the patient's dismal hopelessness, suspicion and mistrust dominate his relationships with others.<br /><br /> Despite the fact that the movie was devoid from sex, violence, or comedy, the public showed great appreciation of the narration of the tragedy of post-traumatic syndrome.  Not only the Saturday's evening show was fully packed, but also did many people reserved the seats for their fellows long time before the movie started.<br /><br /> The only disappointing side of the movie was its abrupt ending without any meaningful outcome.  After an hour and half, the viewer has already assimilated the delusional twilight reality of the traumatized patient into the reality of caring for a mentally ill patient.  With the 1950's mental care, one would think that electric shock therapy could have brought such condition into some sort of normalcy.  However, the narrative of the movie was conveyed mostly as the ill patient perceived his own reality.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>The film's visuals, dialogue, music and sound were stunning yet are characterized by offsetting subtleties that the overall effect is rather numbing yet thoroughly thought provoking. It has been several months since I saw this film in the theater but it still lingers with me. A very subtle yet powerful masterpiece from Martin Scorsese.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>...doesn't mean they aren't after you!<br /><br />Do we really need to state Martin Scorcese's brilliant craftsmanship and talent at this late date?  It is all on display here, in his latest collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio.  Moody and dark and imbued with an atmosphere of paranoia and dread, of deep mystery and conspiracy, I was completely caught up in this effort to take genre material and find new energy and inventiveness within it.<br /><br />The early scenes were so overlain with sombre music and portents I was afraid it was going to be too much, but quickly was mesmerized by the tension Scorcese creates and the imagery he creates to bring the movie down into the realm of conscious and unconscious fear and nightmare, of reality and memory. And it is great imagery and flawless technique that continues to spin the tale as it pitches through raging storms without and within toward a conclusion that I was afraid might be a let down, but I found, while not unexpected, surprisingly workable and satisfying.  And, there is even a final kicker that really makes it all worthwhile!<br /><br />I have to admit I find some critics mystifying.  I think the two doofuses on TV said to Skip It.  Really? Compared to what?  I have to wonder why some people go to the movies.  Is it an intellectual exercise?  Sure, there's that sometimes, but can't they ever allow themselves to be seduced by the sheer ebullience of people working at the top of their game with familiar yet re-imagined material?  To suspend belief just for fun? Shutter Island didn't spring from a world where themes of insanity and conspiracy have never been dealt with before, but it does so with originality and force!<br /><br />I confess there is still a kid in me that can put aside pre-conceived notions and intellectual pretenses and simply be swept up in the vision of master craftsmen working with good writing and interesting material. It worked for me here.  I can understand if it doesn't for you, but anyone saying the movie doesn't have punch and interest, well....aw, whatever.</p></br><a href="../users/AH1OH4PWR7NV6.html">AH1OH4PWR7NV6</a><br/><p>This is not what I expected.  This movie could have gone in so many directions, and I liked trying to predict it.  I was wrong every time.  PTSD, Delusions, paranoia, and hallucinations...  Good job!  The complicated ending was also done well and a WOW for me.  The main characters choice at the end, made me wonder what I would chose.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>(I am not a verified customer because I bought Shutter Island BD at Walmart) Shutter Island is set up by Martin Scorsese as a spooky detective story, but think Scorsese, and ponder the possibilities. Leonardo DiCaprio playing Teddy Daniels, is one of our most recognizable living actors at the moment. And perhaps you are accustomed to his characters with Boston accents, who are rough around the edges and know how to use a gun and carries a badge. But Teddy Daniels is hiding a lie from you, and not until the end will you discover the painful truth.<br /><br />Shutter Island isn't a film with WETA-like effects, instead, it's a film in the hands of a true cinema master relying on story telling. You travel through a physchotic setting into delirium. I was very confused through the movie and that is the point. I questioned everything and sought clairvoyance with insanity in my vision. Teddy Daniels will rock your sane world and perhaps you will have doubts about your own reality after watching this amazing film.<br /><br />(spoilers) As described by many of the reviewers of movies the true qualities of Shutter Island comes with repeated views. You see the effort in telling a story from the perspective of a damaged human mind. You realize that the true characters are representations and that key settings and events are tragedies of Teddy Daniels. The effort and attention to detail requires that you give special praise to Martin Scorsese, yes, but also the hard working film editor Thelma Schoonmaker. These peole never get enough credit in my opinion. Many directors owe their careers to Stuart Baird, who edited the wreck that was their films. Richard Donner gives unending praise to Stuart Baird for many of his movies.<br /><br />As far as the BD as a product, I can't say Shutter Island BD's quality stands out more than say the Avatar BD. Once you've seen and heard Blue-ray you really know what to expect. The special contents are bare on the single BD.

Here's the major problem though, after screening the film, for the second time, it starts to fall apart about halfway through the film.

Teddy is now a U.S. Marshal that investigates the disappearance of a patient from a strange prison-like mental hospital on the rocky formidable East Coast Shutter Island.  The hospital is for the criminally insane.  Teddy is shown traveling on a boat to Shutter Island with his Deputy (Mark Ruffallo).  The waves and wind make him sick and he has to sit down when he reaches the office of the head of the institution. Ben Kingsley plays the man in charge and explains the radical treatments they perform here.  While Teddy is trying to get his "land legs" he is given a pill for headaches.<br /><br />Teddy has strange dreams, flashbacks, visions during his investigation and paranoia sets in that he is being drugged or poisoned.  Teddy quizzes the head of the institution along with most of the staff on the disappearance of Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), a patient admitted after she murdered her three children.<br /><br />The movie is filled with flashbacks, as you wonder why a U.S. Marshall was sent to such a place.  More and more psychological issues arise and Teddy suspects the authorities in charge are not telling him the truth.  The remote Ward C looms large in his mind, he thinks they are holding the arsonist who murdered his wife.<br /><br />Secrets are unraveled that Teddy fights hard not to believe.<br /><br />"Shutter Island" is not that engaging and the abundance of eerie visions end up being more of a sideshow.  It is a hard-to-believe premise for a story, but they try to give it weight by quoting German Concentration Camp and North Korean experiments with prisoners.

But he learns that the prison facility is as escape-proof as can be.

Staff psychiatrists played by Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow add to the gloomy nature of the film.  Kingsley is a great Gandhi, but he can be spooky.  Max von Sydow is usually spooky.<br /><br /> Then the tale takes a turn.<br /><br />Without giving anything away, I just have to admit that  any potential "staging" in the plot was probably impossible, as were the conditions in Cell Block C.<br /><br />I was hoping for more.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>Shutter Island (2009) with Leonardo DiCaprio was a tremendous dissapointment to me. For its nice cinematic and fine camera work I rate it at 4 stars, very good acting 5 stars, and basic story only 2 stars.  I guess it was because of the many TV spots and DVD commercials promoting this film and the fact that it starred Leonardo DiCaprio that I was especially dissapointed, as I expected something much better.  This movie substituted mental illness for a good mystery, as have so many films going back to the late 50's, but especially since the mid 90's which have all made mental illness a fairly common theme or sub-theme. I did not like or enjoy this plot and I actually felt cheated when everything was explained, once again, by a simple case of insanity. It is just not fair to build up what the viewer believes to be true and then switch all the ground rules. I guess I should have rented it before buying it.<br /><br />I love surprise endings which are earned by the story, as in Vertigo, Sixth Sense, and Unbreakable, but this film just cheated.</p></br><a href="../users/AU25GMX57XBVO.html">AU25GMX57XBVO</a><br/><p>I did find Shutter Island to be a little entertaining but just really could not get into it.  The ending was really strange I thought and could have been better.  It is set like in old times 1950's, 60's etc and has that type of feel to it.  The movie almost reminded me of titanic a little, maybe because of it's that same older times feel or because L. DiCaprio was in it as well.  There is a lot of suspense, mystery and really never got board watching it yet for some reason just did not find it very interesting.  A better ending could have changed my opinion for sure.<br /><br />Peter J.

A ship sails in the fog. A passenger is seasick. They both smoke. [No FDA warnings?] The island is a prison for the criminally insane. There was a fort from the Civil War time, now used for the most dangerous prisoners. The two Federal Marshals are there to search for a fugitive. Dr. Cauley made this a unique institution. Rachel Salender escaped last night. She is a war widow who murdered her three children but believes they are still alive. How did she escape from a locked room? The guards are questioned as a group about Rachel. Her primary doctor left the island in the morning. The talk in Dr. Cauley's apartment drags. No cooperation? Teddy Daniels has dreams of the past (a nightmare?). Should patients get lobotomies [never proven to work] or doses of thorazine to make them tranquil?<br /><br />Patients are interviewed. [Is this believable?] Is this for comedy or satire? What kind of glass does Mrs. Kearns drink from? We learn why Teddy Daniels chose this case. Where did Andrew Laytes disappear to? The storm blows down trees. Daniels recalls his past in the war at Dachau. [Were those guards really shot after they surrendered?] Daniels tells about George Noyce and how he was put in Ashcliff. Can he be believed? [Daniels trusts his co-worker.] Is there a ruse to put them there? Rachel was found. They talk to her, she acts crazy. Teddy has a migraine, and more dreams. [The film begins to drag again.] A scream starts a new dream. "See!" Teddy dreams of his wife again. Then they visit Ward C, the oldest and most dangerous ward.<br /><br />Andrew pops up for a dramatic surprise. There is a fight. A guard shows up. Teddy wanders off, and finds George Noyce. "They knew." [The film starts to drag again.] Is the story credible? What is happening on this island? Teddy wants to see the lighthouse. [Wouldn't a lighthouse be located on the top of that island? Would Teddy climb down those slippery rocks? The real Rachel Salender is hiding in a cave. [Food and water?] She asked about sodium amytal shipments and lobotomies. Could patients be brainwashed into automatons? "Any funny dreams or trouble sleeping?" [Is this the message of this movie?] "You'll never leave here" says Rachel. The guard says "God loves violence". Teddy was wandering.<br /><br />Dr. Cauley tells Teddy he had no partner. A doctor meets Teddy. "Don't go, Teddy." Hallucinations? [Swimming in ice cold water?] Guards with rifles? Teddy climbs the stairs to the top of the lighthouse. Chloropromazine for the past 24 months? [Can you believe the ending? Isn't it too incredible?] "We're telling you the truth." There is another flashback to years earlier that explains it all. Or does it? [Unbelievable?] Just when you think this film can't get any worse a shot is fired. Then we are back to the present to hear the confession. "We're too smart for them." So Teddy goes for a walk.<br /><br />This movie didn't fool the people, audiences stayed away from it after the first week. Was this the worst film since "The Runaway Jury" or "The Blair Witch Project"? This is a first rate production of a third-rate story. Should the director retire already?</p></br><a href="../users/A31JRSZQ76YA1N.html">A31JRSZQ76YA1N</a><br/><p>let's not waste one drop!  Must have been hell for the actors - wet most of the movie - and even more of a nightmare for the costume department ...... somewhat a total wast eof time - nicely atmospheric, but the performances are blah - very blah.<br /><br />Mr. Scorsese - stick to what you know best - Hitchcock is sorely missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>3.5 stars<br /><br />Scorsese had all the right ideas here, but at 140 minutes this was 30 too long for my taste, and didn't leave me feeling anything but somewhat disappointed, despite fine performances and a good story.<br /><br />DiCaprio is excellent as usual, as is Kingsley, but the script takes too long to unfold, and after a while I began to smell the coming twist {spoilers on the way}. The bummer for me is that this film flirts with the incredible cinematic potential of the MK Ultra project, but backs off just when it could truly have broken new ground. Jacob's Ladder addresses many of the themes here much more convincingly, and if you liked this make sure to see that one. Both JL and Fight Club came to mind while watching this, but both of those brought it all home with much more weight.<br /><br />This film looks very fine on blu-ray, and the subtle CGI adds to the paranoid feel. The music is rather too obvious and telegraphic, but clearly that was the idea. MS sure knows how to move a camera and compose a shot, truly a master. But this one needed way more editing to have the impact it wanted, and it all drags long enough that the ending is more a relief than a surprise.<br /><br />Back to the MK Ultra theme, and the brief nod to Operation Paperclip (look them up if you don't know of them, and prepare to learn some incredible American history they left out of your schoolbooks): these are topics that are DYING to be turned into a truly classic film, and Scorsese is a perfect candidate. For a while here I was thrilled to think that these vital missing links in our post-war history would finally be looked at in depth, but they're merely passing fragments. Come on, Marty! You or Francis could make a movie about those topics that would change the way we see ourselves as a country, and maybe even influence present political culture for the better...so please do!<br /><br />But in the meantime we get a very good-looking gothic throwaway, based on Lehane's novel but with little of his special touch. The Aviator and The Departed both blow this one out of the water, and while Scorsese and DiCaprio still make a fine team, I'm looking forward to another outing from them of higher quality once again, with more incision and less scattershot intensity.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Too rarely are we offered films that are so well written (Laeta Kalogidis does a marvelous adaptation of Dennis Lahane's mesmerizing novel) that after viewing the audience is almost afraid to leave the theater or home screen for fear they may have missed some important information that will help them figure out why the story is so successfully enigmatic.  Such is the case for Martin Scorsese's brilliant film, SHUTTER ISLAND. It is only in retrospect, after the shock of the film is over, that the magic of quality cinematic achievement can be appreciated.  Then in rethinking the events the film portrays so well the story is as straightforward as Scorsese's vision.<br /><br />The film opens in 1954  nothingness - from out of the fog slowly appears a ship headed toward Shutter Island, a terrifying prison for the criminally insane, and almost incidentally we meet US Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) emetically cloistered in a ship's lavatory while his newly assigned partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) awkwardly waits for him on deck.  The two are on a mission to investigate the escape of a female prisoner.  They are greeted by curious wardens who escort them onto the terrifyingly ugly and ominous island to meet with the famous psychiatrist Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow).  Curious restrictions are placed on the Marshals who decide to return to Boston because of lack of cooperation from the psychiatrists.  A hurricane prevents their exit and slowly the story unwinds: Daniels is haunted by memories of his war experience in viewing the concentration camps in Dachau and delusion of his wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) in nightmares he cannot explain.  The various aspects of the Marshals' investigation lead them to all of the compounds where prisoners are kept and treated and surgically altered and the terror mounts.  To tell more of the story of one man's descent in to madness would distract from the viewer's own grappling with the conundrum of this tale.  It must be seen to appreciate the brilliance of the story.<br /><br />In addition to superb performances by DiCaprio, Ruffalo, Kingsley, von Sydow, and Williams there are astonishing well crafted cameos by Patricia Clarkson, Elias Koteas, Emily Mortimer, John Carroll Lynch and a very large cast of bit players. The cinematography is superbly crafted by Robert Richardson.  The music score for this moody piece is a montage of works by such brilliant composers as Gy&ouml;rgy Ligeti, Krzystof Penderecki, John Cage, Morton Feldman, Schnittke, Lou Harrison, John Adams and even Gustav Mahler whose rarely heard 'Quartet for Piano and Strings in A minor' plays a significant role in the film.  On all accounts this is a superb film. Why it did not do well in the theatrical run is puzzling: perhaps it is a long film that is way ahead of its time.  Watch it on DVD and become absorbed by all the bizarre mysteries it captures.

I wasn't scared, although I was completely compelled from top to bottom. Thank the lord that great Directors like Martin Scorsese are still around who prove that you don't have to do 'popcorn movie' stuff to keep audiences rivoted. You can capture an audience with perfectly timed scenes and haunting sounds of a lonely and secluded Shutter Island, home for hundreds of the criminally insane... or just with a great and subtle performance from a really good actor.<br /><br />When you think of Martin Scorsese, you think of Goodfellas, Casino, Taxi Driver & Raging Bull. With SHUTTER ISLAND, you forget about who made the movie, and that's a good thing. You get sucked in, you don't have expectations. From the quiet opening scene where you hear the horn of the fishing boat approaching the Island as the waves hit the side of the boat to the crippling finale, Scorsese paints a beautiful picture.<br /><br />SHUTTER ISLAND isn't gonna get the accolades that some of Scorsese's film have, but to be perfectly honest, it should have been nominated for best picture this year. DiCaprio should have been nominated. Scorsese, in my mind, proved this year that he's above and beyond the working directors today. He's still an artist. While everybody else is answering to their studios to apease the BLOW IT UP & NOBODY CARES ABOUT EMOTIONS crowd, Scorsese is still the great artist that he's always been.<br /><br />SHUTTER ISLAND is another great addition to Scorsese's long list of brilliant films.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FY3H6F4249E0.html">A3FY3H6F4249E0</a><br/><p>WOW!--in caps!<br />This was an excellent movie--a Martin Scorsese picture.  I call it a psychological thriller because it really messes with your head.  Through the whole movie, I didn't know what was real and what was imaginatory.  It had me hooked. I was engrossed in the story from the very beginning right through to the end, and the time passed so fast.<br /><br />Our story begins in Boston Harbor Islands, 1954.  Ted/Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a U.S. Federal Marshall traveling on a small boat with his head in the commode, barfing away from motion sickness.  (Don't worry.  You don't see anything.)  Charlie/Chuck is another Marshall traveling with him--calls Ted "Boss".  They are enroute to Shutter Island, a one-of-a kind Federal psychiatric treatment and housing facility for the severely criminally insane.  Of course, this is a high-security facility, surrounded by an electric perimeter and police or guards (not sure which, but will call them "guards" here), and is on an island with high, rocky cliffs.  The only way in or out is via ferry, and the ferry is controlled by the federal facility.<br /><br />As Teddy and Chuck's ferry docks at the Shutter Island pier, they are met by guards and transported to and inside the facility perimeter.  The outside grounds are beautiful!--pretty as an English mansion.  Some of the "guests" are manning the grounds as the guards explain to Teddy and Chuck that buildings A and B house the better adjusted guests while building C is for the most dangerous ones.  These are the incurables.  Building C is an old fort.<br /><br />We soon meet the primary doctor, played by Ben Kingsley.  He explains basically that the concept of the hospital is to provide treatment for the severely criminally insane who are beyond help at other facilities.  If the hospital cannot help the guests, they claim to at least try to provide a means of comfort for the guests to live in.  We also soon meet Max VonSydow (Needful Things, Buck Rogers, Three Days of the Condor, and many other movies) as another doctor and primary member of the hospital staff.<br /><br />Teddy and Chuck were sent to investigate the disappearance of a guest, Rachel Solondo.  Rachel drowned her three children in the lake but believes they are still alive.  She also believes the facility is actually her home in the Berkshires and the others are all attendants, so it is unlikely that she would try to leave, besides--there is no way to get out and no where to go if she did.<br /><br />Teddy also has his own demons to deal with.  He was one of the WWII soldiers who got to bust up the Krakow concentration camp at the end of the war.  Seeing the piles of dead bodies (men, women, and children) and the living victims of the camp left him with nightmares and flashbacks.  In addition, he is tormented by the memories of his pretty wife dying in a fire caused by an arsonist.  In the midst of his investigation and a raging hurricane, he becomes convinced that this facility is a house of medical experimentation in the use of psychotropic drugs, brain surgery, and barbaric torture.  Although he is told to "RUN," he is determined to find out the truth.<br /><br />As I said before, this is a "WOW" movie.  It kept my mind completely engaged throughout the entire movie.  DiCaprio did a fantastic job in his role and you really could not second guess what would happen next.  Even though I know what happens, I would watch it again in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Note that I do NOT suggest this movie for your children.  ADULTS ONLY is my strong recommendation--as in age 18 or older.  I believe the concepts are too harsh for a developing mind. So please, watch it first by yourself--then decide.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Shutter Island" is excellent!

However, since it was made by Martin Scorsese, I expect a lot more. When you are among the best directors, you have high expectations...which I felt that this movie did not fullfill. This movie looks a lot better in the trailer than it did played out over it's full length.<br /><br />Most of "Shutter Island"is pretty good, as far as the casting (Leonardo DiCaprio and Ben Kingsley are great), the scenery is effective, and the sound lends to the atmosphere.<br /><br />I just thought that the story was lame (NOTE, I am purposely not going into the plot since it will impact/reveal the mystery). When the film is all done, you feel as though you watched a "Scooby Doo" ending.<br /><br />This atmospheric movie is a weak Scorsese film. It would best be compared to "Cape Fear" whic was far more effective.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`Shutter Island' is a thriller set in the fifties which follows two US Marshals who are investigating an escape at an institute for the criminally insane. The asylum is on an island and they get stranded there after a big storm sweeps in after their arrival. They have to work out how the patient escaped and what other sinister things have been occurring on the island before it is all too late. Di Caprio plays Edward Daniels, one of the Marshals, who is also traumatised by his past during and after the war and he relives some of this history via flashbacks throughout the film.<br /><br />This had a dark, sinister feel to it from the word go and you are very quickly drawn into the intrigue and mystery on the island. You are unsure whether the head doctor is trustworthy or not and the other patients also add a surreal element to the proceedings. Everyone plays their roles very well and Kingsley is especially noteworthy as the head doctor. This is excellently directed by Scorsese and the soundtrack also adds to the tension, as any good score should.<br /><br />This has a twist in the end, that although fairly predictable, still ties things up neatly and gives you food for thought long after you've finished watching. More and more scenes become clearer as you think back and characters motivations make more sense.

But as I started to reach the end, it seemed that the plot was reaching a conclusion which made the whole movie rather pointless, if not depressing.<br /><br />Then the ending of the movie turned me upside down and gave me a serious case of vertigo.  I was being told that most of what I had come to believe and become attached to during the movie was flat out wrong.  In fact, the shock to my beliefs regarding the characters and plot was so profound that I had to watch the bonus materials on the DVD to finally believe and accept what I was now being told.  Never before have I had an experience like this with a movie, and the movie is thus uniquely brilliant and certainly worth watching more than once.<br /><br />The general lesson which is illustrated with tremendous power is that, even among those of us who actively try to be objective and critical thinkers guided by evidence, we're still very prone to developing false beliefs and then bending over backwards to resist evidence which contradicts those beliefs.

DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, a U.S. Marshal who, along with his partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) come to the island to investigate the disappearance of an inmate of the island's hospital for the criminally insane.  What begins as a "whodunit with everyone hiding something" develops into something else entirely, with a twist that you will more than likely see coming almost a mile away.  That aside though, Shutter Island as a whole is a more than competantly made thriller.  DiCaprio is quite good, as are Ruffalo and Ben Kingsley as the facility's head doctor, with smaller roles from Michelle Williams, Max Von Sydow, Patricia Clarkson, Jackie Earle Haley, Emily Mortimer, and Ted Levine; while the film boasts some wonderful cinematography and film editing.  With a fairly unsettling conclusion, Shutter Island may not be the kind of film that one would expect from Martin Scorsese, but if there's anything that the legendary director may be familiar with, it's with providing audiences with the unexpected, and that in itself makes the film so worthwhile in the first place.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>Martin Scorsese has given us a film depiction of the inglorious book written by Dennis Lehane.

The book was a best seller and this film should be right there up with the novel.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio delivers an exquisite performance as the Federal Marshall who comes to Shutter Island to solve the mystery of a lost woman patient. Shutter Island is an Insane Asylum for the Criminally Insane, and quite an island it is. Off the coast of Boston Harbor this island is one of your worst nightmares. Marshall Teddy Daniels and his new partner, played by Mark Ruffalo, team up together to solve the mystery. But, what they find is a series of mysteries upon mysteries, and the more they<br />look, the more bizarre the situation becomes. Bit by bit Teddy becomes more involved and caught up in the nightmare of the treatments that are occurring on this island. The anxiety that becomes Teddy becomes our anxiety and the old Nazi captains and the stories of children drowning become more real. Take a ride with Teddy in this insane, mad world. What you will discover is so antithetical to anything you ever believed possible. This is a glorious tale, told with the majesty of Martin Scorsese. The  soundtrack from Robbie Robertson is ominous and stunning.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  prisrob 06-15-10<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001N44BVQ">Body of Lies (Widescreen Edition)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305941122">A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies</a></p></br><a href="../users/ARYSE5JQ3AG7L.html">ARYSE5JQ3AG7L</a><br/><p>I thought Shutter Island was going to be an action horror movie.

Not content to rest on his laurels after wresting the elusive Oscar (if he ever pursued it in the first place) Scorsese pushes and challenges himself and creates a work unlike anything in his canon.  Though the influence of Kubrick and Hitchcock are apparent "Shutter Island" is unique and original and totally Marty.  I could also see the influence of Shyamalan before he fell out of favor.  It would behoove Shyamalan to view this film so he can get his career back on track.  "Shutter Island" is a complex film that demands close attention sort of like a jigsaw puzzle where the true picture isn't apparent until all the interlocking pieces are connected.  I may have to qualify that because the ending does contain a certain level of ambiguity.  Along with "Inception", which coincidentally stars Leonardo DiCaprio as well, this may be the best picture so far this year.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EUSH8DPW75LR.html">A3EUSH8DPW75LR</a><br/><p>I love this film.

But this film is one where when they say it must be viewed twice they mean it.  Knowing the ending actually made a repeat viewing even better than the first.  I must note that after the first viewing I did enjoy it enough to purchase it.  I have now viewed it three times.  Of course we have two masters here - Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio.  In less talented hands than Scorsese this film could have turned into a regular B horror film.  But Scorsese treats the slightly flawed script with respect and the directing, music, photography, editing and most of all acting make this a grade A film all the way.  Leonardo DiCaprio is now proving film after film just what a skilled actor he is.  For me this was the best performance of his career and shows him to be one of the best actors of this deacade.  And perfect performances are elicited from Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsley as well.  Actually this film was made with such precise decisions that even all the supporting roles down to the smallest ones are pitch perfect.  Of most note are Michelle Williams and Patricia Clarkson.<br /><br />The film begins with Leonardo DiCaprio as U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels going with his new partner played by Ruffalo to Shutter Island which is an asylum for the criminally insane to investigate the disappearance of a female inmate.  But no one is actually as they seem and truths about the island start to appear to Teddy and he realizes that things are sinister and there are many secrets here.  Then we get twists and turns galore that build to a very dramatic ending.  This is a film that must be viewed for it is cinema at its best.  We have the master director Scorsese turning an ok script into a suspense masterpiece.  From the beginning boat ride with the spooky atmospheric music you can sit back knowing you are going to have a super suspenseful ride.  Let the grade A directing and flawless acting bring you to another world.  I can't give this film 5 stars for the script is slightly flawed but I will view it over and over for the superb piece of film making it is.  And it makes a brilliant showing on blu ray.  The picture is very crisp and clarity superb.  Colors are brilliant and the whole experience will make you feel as if you are there.  Good film making still exists and here is a perfect example.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>By and large, I am a huge fan of films in the same genre of Shutter Island (thriller; big surprise at the end).  A few of my favorites that come to mind are The Sixth Sense, The Others, and Identity.  Shutter Island should, by all means, have had the same effect on me, but one key detail got in the way: the way the film was advertised.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, this film opens with a missing-persons investigation on Shutter Island, which houses the most dangerous mental asylum in the world.  Detective Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) leads the investigation, and begins to discover that there is a lot more to Shutter Island than what meets the eye.  I can't tell you any more out of fear of loosing major spoilers.<br /><br />In terms of overall plot and acting, this film is excellent in nearly every sense.  The mood is creepy, the acting is competent, and the plot throws you for multiple loops along the way before going for the KO in the final minutes.  It is also one of those movies where it takes a little bit of time for all the themes to sink in.  About an hour after viewing (or once my mind had finished sifting through things), I actually appreciated it more than while the credits were rolling.<br /><br />However, the major problem with this film lies (sadly) in the way it was advertised.  While watching those thriller classics I listed in the opening, I had absolutely no idea they would end with a huge twist, thus giving it all the more punch when it did occur.  Shutter Island, though, was advertised as having "the biggest mind-blowing ending ever" (or something to that extent), and thus during the entire viewing I was guessing at what could REALLY be going on.  Thus, while the ending was still shocking, it was already one of the many possible conclusions running through my head while the DVD was spinning, leading to less of a surprise.  Perhaps I was just smart enough to figure things out, but I doubt it (!).  I'm guessing that many attentive viewers went in with the same thought-processes as me, and maybe found themselves a bit underwhelmed by the ending for the same reason.<br /><br />Thus, while Shutter Island is still an excellent addition to the "Thriller" genre, I would have appreciated it if they would have advertised it as a straight-forward cop drama, THEN thrown in the twist.  Of course, the marketing crew likely played up the surprise ending to get butts in the seats, but for those thinking-viewers among us, it kind of cheapens the experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CL82UITQJLWS.html">A3CL82UITQJLWS</a><br/><p>One of the best films I've seen lately. I didn't know what to expect from this movie I thought it was a horror film, but its not. Great acting and story. I rented this, but will buy once the price comes down. I'd recommend it</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>Shutter Island is an exquisitely crafted horror film noir that garbs your attention by the throat and never lets go until the very final frame of the picture. The acting is very convincing; Leonardo DiCaprio in particular gives one of his very best performances. The casting was thoughtfully done and this makes the film even more powerful; and the cinematography combined with the choreography pack quite a punch. The script was well written, too.<br /><br />When the film starts we meet US federal marshals Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) who are on their way by ferry to an eerie island off the Massachusetts coast where Ashcliff hospital for the dangerously criminally insane is located. One of the patients has escaped from her locked room; and the staff, including Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow) simply have no clue as to how she escaped and where she could be on this remote and foreboding island with its rocky cliffs--and no transportation to and from the mainland except for a single, highly guarded ferry boat. Unfortunately, however, Teddy and his partner Chuck are thwarted by Dr. Cawley, who refuses to make staff records available to them.<br /><br />There's so much more that I can tell you without giving too much away. Right from the very beginning we can see how Teddy can't handle the water; his seasickness on the ferry boat to Shutter Island is just the beginning of what will prove to be a series of unpleasant and even horrifying things that happen to him. Moreover, Teddy's new partner doesn't know the real reason Teddy wanted this assignment. Teddy found out that the man who started a fire that killed his wife and daughter, Laeddis (Elias Koteas), is in the hospital there and Teddy wants revenge. Teddy also wants to "blow the lid off" what he thinks is the hospital's ability to secretly experiment on the mind using lobotomies and other questionable surgical procedures. In addition, slowly but surely we begin to see how Shutter Island resembles a concentration camp from World War Two that Teddy helped to liberate.<br /><br />There's still so much more, but suffice it to say that gradually Teddy's flashbacks and other visions become more and more frequent and unsettling. His partner Chuck goes missing; will Teddy be able to find him? How does Teddy's World War Two experience factor into this? Will Teddy and his partner ever find the missing patient; or will they have to retreat and experience the embarrassment that they failed in their mission to locate the missing patient and, for Teddy, to get even with Laeddis?<br /><br />It may well appear that I've given it all away; but there are still so many surprises and unexpected plot twists that I assure you I haven't. Indeed, the final fifteen to twenty minutes of the film provide such a, unexpected, shocking conclusion that it will haunt you for quite some while to come. Look also for good performances by Jackie Earle Haley as George Noyce and Patricia Clarkson as "Rachel 2." Michelle Williams is exceptionally good at playing Teddy's late wife, Dolores.<br /><br />The DVD doesn't come with any extras; I would have loved a commentary with Scorsese, DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo or even all three; but we just don't get it.<br /><br />Shutter Island may not be for the faint of heart; but for those of us who choose to watch and own this movie on DVD will not be disappointed. There's so much suspense in this psychological thriller that it's truly remarkable; this will have a lasting impact on you. I highly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>PROS:<br />*Beautifully filmed<br />*A strong performance from Leonardo DiCaprio<br />*Excellent support from Ben Kingsley, Ted Levine, Patricia Clarkson and Max von Sydow<br />*Good direction from Mr. Scorsese<br />*Some real haunting imagery<br />CONS:<br />*Disappointing ending<br />*Disappointing turns from Mark Ruffalo, Michelle Williams and Emily Mortimer<br />*Sometimes music score too bombastic<br />SUMMARY:  Competent and disturbing thriller that keeps you involved.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TKM36EYEQNSM.html">A1TKM36EYEQNSM</a><br/><p>This film may only be a one time view for some.  There are so many questions that you have throughout the movie and it seems they are answered at the end.  However, the last shot creates a question, so, is what you have at the end the reality or not?<br /><br />Similar in ways to movies like 'The Green Mile' in its depiction of the death of three children or like the surprise you may remember at the end of 'The Sixth Sense.'  This movie is sometimes very riveting and you are wondering if he is getting deeper into problems as the movie progresses.<br /><br />To me, there may have been a better viewership of this one if the trailers did not make it look like a horror movie.  At least to me, seeing what they portrayed made it look like that more than a suspense thriller.<br /><br />Dicaprio does a great job in his intensity and his confusion in dealing with his days attempting to solve a puzzle at the institution.  Is he going after someone, trying to expose a conspiracy, or what?  Ruffalo, Kingsley and von Sydow are just excellent in their delivery.  Kingsley comes across as compassionate, then he is adversarial, then down right confusion.  Since the movie takes place just a decade after WWII, you don't know if von Sydow's character is a former Nazi or not.  This all adds to the issues that Dicaprio is attempting to uncover.<br /><br />I would have viewed this earlier if not for thinking it was more of a horror film.  Overall, the plot is engaging and you are wondering when the next 'big thing' is going to happen.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>Something has happened on Shutter Island and it is up to two law enforcement officals to figure out what. One is a seasons veteran and the other is his new partner, and they both find themselves pulled into something that seems much more difficult than a case of a missing woman. This leads the lead detective to question what is going on, and before long he finds himself wondering what secrets lie in this place that holds so many secrets about everything - including himself.<br /><br />On many levels, I thought this film was a great piece of work. It had all the elements one would want from a movie develing into a place that treats the worst types of criminal minds, with it looking at everything through the eyes of both patients and detectives. It has secret plots and twists, a lot of things you can't trust, and a plot that leaves you wondering what Leo really knows as he walks through his investigation.<br /><br />There were a few times in the movie I found myself able to predict what was going on, and some of that really hurt the ending. I think that is because movies have to have some catch these days, but this catch is one that is both interesting and hard to talk about without saying too much. If, for instance, you review for content, you will say too much. Even discussing characters says some things that possibly shouldn't be said. So, instead of going that route, I will simply say that the plot is great, the effects have an impact, and the end is one that completes a puzzle and makes you feel sorrow at the same time.<br /><br />Would I say buy this film? I'm torn on that one. I would say that you would like to watch it more than once, and that it would be something that makes more sense as you catch all the little pieces. Still, I didn't benifit from the buy itself because I watched all these parts all at once, but cannot find a reason that a person would not want to buy it simply because it has so much to offer.<br /><br />Read reviews on it, be really careful if a person says anything about spoilers, and enjoy your film. You will enjoy it, too, because it is hard not to. Its like a puzzle you have to put together and, when you do, you find yourself rewarded.<br />Personally, I liked what Leo did here, and the way his character brings everything to light.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>This is an above average thriller that takes place on a forbidding, windswept island facility for  the insane, including criminals, and it is set in the 1950s.  DiCaprio is a federal marshal who comes to the island to help find a supposedly escaped prisoner.  I can't say much more without spoiling it, but suffice to say that he gives a great performance, as do Ben Kingsley and Mark Ruffalo, as he continues his investigation and uncovers many secrets<br />--some of which he had hidden away in his own mind, regarding his tragic past and the life he used to have with his family.<br /><br />There are some very disturbing images throughout the films:  dead, frozen bodies in a concentration camp; other dead people; horrible conditions in the ward for the most dangerous prisoners, etc.  Be warned. This might not be for you if you are easily upset or prone to nightmares.<br /><br />Otherwise, enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>I have said this before and I will say it again. If it wasn't for Kevin Costner, 'Goodfellas' would have recieved the best picture honor in 1990. Martin Scorcese for the past 20 years has given us some of the most meorable movies of our generation. They have a very similar theme and tend to use the same actors as well. Now, we are given 'Shutter Island', which is a step away from the usual and giving us something fresh.<br /><br />I had no idea that this film was based on a comic book, but seeing the trailers and knowing how well DiCaprio works with Scorcese I was very eagar to see how this movie turned out. The movie was a good watch, but there were a few flaws to it. Still, I don't want to rip this film because this was a brave move by Scorcese. He decided to break the usual mafia mold and give us a psychological thriller. We do have the Scorcese elements such as the large amount of 'F' bombs and the whole 1950s/1960s gangster/detective vibe which he loves to do. Still, The acting was great, especially in the every end when the truth about Shutter Island was revield. DiCaprio's performace throughout the movie was good, but bland at times until the very end. His character took a huge twist and the dramatic turn her took was just incredible it made up for the last hour and a half. The movie I felt was too predictable. I pretty much figured out what was going on about half way into the movie. As a whole package it was definitely something new from a director who's work I enjoy.<br /><br />My thoughts on 'Shutter Island', take the time to see it. It was a new step in Martin Scorcese's career I would love to see if he intends to continue trying new genres of film. While predictable it is still enjoyable.</p></br></body></html>

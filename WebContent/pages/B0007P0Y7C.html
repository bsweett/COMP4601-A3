In this movie we find elektra alive and well after dying in Daredevil.  But she is going through a rough time in which she doesn't see the HUMAN inside herself.  AS an assassian she is given the job to kill a man and his daughter only to find out that she is the next generation of people who will save the world.  SO Elektra can not kill her because of that.  During the rest of the film we find that ELektra has indeed found her Humanity and self-respect again.  She now is able to live life as she was meant to.  With dazzling special effects and decent acting this movie is a more than entertaining film about self discovery.  However, it is choppy at points and never truely pushs its ideals onto the audience in which it is trying to please.  A movie that is good for fans of Comic books and an average entertaining movie for everyone else.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I49HL6XR62DI.html">A3I49HL6XR62DI</a><br/><p>This is the worst superhero film I have ever seen. Remember how promising the character Elektra seemed in Daredevil? Well, forget it. Jennifer Garner is lucky to have survived this boring, illogical mess.  Can someone tell me how Elektra manages to set off a natural gas explosion inside a house without burning the entire house down? And then there is the climactic battle between Elektra and the evil ninja in a room full of flapping sheets to disguise the action or lack thereof. Forget this one. It makes Halle Berry's Catwoman look like Citizen Kane.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>When theatrical releases fail to find an audience, and the first DVD editions don't catch fire, one rule of thumb is to bring out a "special edition." Even better, call it a "director's cut" and then add the magic word "unrated." In the case of ELEKTRA Unrated Director's Cut, the tweaked new version is actually more entertaining than previous incarnations. It's tighter (four minutes shorter), there's new action, effects, flashbacks, sound mix and commentary.<br /><br />The second disc includes a two hour and 20 minute, two part making-of feature, deleted, alternate/extended scenes, new opening, storyboards and more.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>I'm not a big comic book fan, but I was really looking forward to seeing Jennifer Garner in 'Elektra.'  Spin-off or not, it doesn't matter, for if you have seen 'Alias' series, you know Ms. Garner has star quality, and that she can not only act, but do great action stunts herself.<br /><br />But ... oh dear, what happened?  Though Jennifer Garner's Elektra in sexy tight red costume is brought to life (thanks to her sensei Terence Stamp), the actions are not exciting as they should be, so-so at best, and the script is simply awful.  Tedious flashbacks showing Elektra's trauma as little girl?  Ninja-like villains whose mannerism is based psuedo-Japanese culture, and masterminds played by typecast Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and Will Yun Lee?  I thought ninja characters are dead in Hollywood back in the 80s.<br /><br />Besides the lifeless characters surrounding Elektra, the martial arts action scenes are heavily cut and edited, so all you see in action parts is a series of short bits (like 2-5 seconds), or creepy animals created with CGIs.  It's the worst type of editing, too fast, too MTV-like.<br /><br />I find the unique team of the assassins -- Stone, Tattoo, Kinkou, Typhoid -- are very interesting (more so than Goran Visnjic and his daughter), and surely they could have provided exciting fight scenes, if pitted against Elektra effectively.  Well, they fight each other, Elektra and killers, but the fact is Rob Bowman fails to make good use of the assassins' abilities, and they vanish from the screen too quickly.  The only original thing about thrie fight is the deadly kiss -- of Elektra and Typhoid -- a sort of guilty pleasure.<br /><br />Maybe there is a director's cut somewhere in the vault of the studio.  If so, we want to see it right now, for the present film desperately needs less talks and more actions, and better editing.</p></br><a href="../users/ATU6AN7OFVO0M.html">ATU6AN7OFVO0M</a><br/><p>I'd never seen this movie in big screen, but one of my friends told me it was an average movie. when the dvd released, I Bought to put it near my daredevil DVDs (special 2 discs edition & directors cut), oh my... when i watched it... it was not an average movie but one of the worst superhero movies i've ever seen. too much lies! terrible actings and a boring story! not comperable with daredevil in any way, daredevil was a five star movie but this can hardly get one star! its just like one of jackie chan recent and cheap movies with a TV Worthy picture and special effects. it's not even worth to rent. don't be fool by the beautiful and kind of sexy photo on the cover of dvd! don't buy it even you are a super hero DVD Collector</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Admittedly not a fan of Marvel comic hero stories or films, this viewer reluctantly watched the DVD of ELEKTRA as a trade-off for lack of other available films to rent. That being said, this vehicle for Jennifer Garner as the title comic book heroine is full of surprises.  Certainly none of the surprises are associated with the formulaic plot, a plot made worse with some mediocre script writing.  The pleasures are in the cinematography which detail elegant views of what appears to be the Pacific Northwest, in the presence of some very fine actors chronically underused (Terence Stamp, Colin Cunningham,  Goran Visnjic so memorable from THE DEEP END, and American Korean Will Yun Lee voted one of the world's most beautiful people in 2002), and in the nicely choreographed martial arts sequences which unfortunately are marred by victims swirling into sulfurous dust in demise.<br /><br />The story is simply Good versus Evil, the Good being Jennifer Garner's pouty-lipped Elektra, Terence Stamp's dignified mentor Stick, and father daughter team of Visnjic and Kirsten Prout and the Bad being the Hand of Asian guys headed by Roshi (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), Kirigi (the dashing Will Yun Lee), and some truly obnoxious creatures such as Tattoo (Chris Ackerman) whose body art comes to vivid life as various demons, and the well-named Typhoid (a truly awful Natassia Malthe) who is a parody of the entire comic genre.<br /><br />The thing that makes ELEKTRA work is the grounding of the film in natural settings instead of the usual hokey castles and dungeons replete with flying monsters and disintegrating planets. Though it will not make a believer out of those who have a low tolerance for the Marvel folk, it has its moments that satisfy the eye.  Grady Harp, May 2005</p></br><a href="../users/A1HX00DL0SZM1G.html">A1HX00DL0SZM1G</a><br/><p>I was sitting with a female friend of mine looking over a selection of DVDs to check out and we came across the latest martial arts superhero flick "ELEKTRA." Turning to me and pointing at the cover shot of Jennifer Garner she said to me "Now, I'm not into girls - but she is HOT!"<br />And that is a major draw for this movie - that and the impressive action scenes in which Garner puts her ALIAS tv show fighting chops to practice once more in a heart pounding series of set pieces.<br />But the main attraction (acknowledged reluctantly by Garner herself in pre-release publicity) is Garners super-sexy physique, nicely accented by the skin-tight red outfit she wears in the movie.<br />Serious and thought-provoking drama this is not - but to its credit it doesn't pretend to be. Sure there is character angst on the part of Elektra dealing with the death of her mother and the inner turmoil over being assigned to kill a young girl and her father. There is a lesbian subtext most visibly illustrated by the main female villainess giving Elektra (quite literally) the kiss of death and some character struggles on the part of the father and daughter. But for the most part the entire cast realize that this is pure popcorn fodder and act accordingly.<br />The plot (for what it is) revolves around the title character. An assassin for hire, she is a seemingly ghost-like figure who can evade high-tech security systems to get to her prey. Then while waiting for her next assignment she befriends a precocious young girl Abby (Kirsten Prout) and her protective father (played by Goran Visnjic). Eventually the orders arrive - the targets are the two. Feeling a connection with the young girl Elektra decides to protect them and the race is on as she attempts to keep one step ahead of the mystical criminal organization known only as The Hand.<br />Not surprisingly the actor who impressed me the most is the venerable Terence Stamp who plays Elektra's mentor Stick, also turning in a wonderful performance is the young Prout, who steals almost every scene in which she appears.<br />Directed by Rob Bowman, who proved he could direct action well in the excellent modern-day dragon picture REIGN OF FIRE, this movie moves along at a fair clip and does not outstay its welcome. Its not high drama or a romantic comedy - it's a no nonsense action flick that will appeal to ALIAS fans and most alpha-males who appreciate suspenseful, tension filled action scenes and shots of Garner in navel-revealing outfits.<br />The DVD includes three deleted scenes that  were "deleted" for good reason, a rather EPK fluff making-of documentary that includes both interviews with Bowman and Garner, a piece on Garner's time at the Comic Convention a rather nifty editing-room feature and the trailer. Hopefully one day when this movie has passed into cult-favorite status (as it is bound to become) they will get Bowman and Garner together for an audio commentary.<br />Until that day, sit back and enjoy some straightforward, good natured Jennifer Garner fun.<br /><br />Blu-ray update:<br />The video quality of the high definition Blu-ray is quite good and not surprisingly easily bests its standard def DVD counterpart, even if its blacks are little too dark at times. The Elektra costume is a nice cherry red while the foliage is a rich green, and the detail is extremely textured. The audio presentation on the Blu-ray is also simply excellent, with a rocking DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround track that will put your sound system to the test. There are a number of cross-channel effects and the LFE channel positively throbs with energy. All around, an extremely effective audio presentation that is definitely better than its DVD counterpart.<br />The supplements are headlined by "Reign of Fire" director Rob Bowman and an interestingly making of documentary that is significantly longer than the film it covers. In two parts, the "Relentless: Making of Elektra" clocks in at 2 hours 20 minutes. But, there's more, we are also treated to a 52 minute "Elektra: Incarnations" documentary that examines Elektra in the comic books. There's also a 15-minute "Elektra in Greek Mythology" which details, variations of the Elektra story in mythology. Rounding out the supplements is over 13 minutes of alternate or extended scenes, 5 minutes of deleted scenes, 2 trailers and a 2-minute + multi-angle feature of the fight scene at the well.<br />So, the verdict. If you are an Elektra fan, or a fan of Jennifer Garner at her sexiest, this Blu-ray as a purchase is a no brainer. The movie itself is popcorn fun, if terribly written, and the supplements are probably the most extensive you are likely to ever see. If the price point is right you should add this Blu-ray to your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>Note: I just saw the theatrical cut of this film with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.<br /><br />Elektra, the sequel to Daredevil, has a very good trailer, a great opening action sequence and of course, Jennifer Garner, but that was basically it. There's a scene in the trailer which is not in the movie for some reason, and the plot is basically chopped up, like an appetizing Big-N'-Toasty that looks great when advertised on television, but the actual meal is a let-down. The actual storyline was good, but it could have been much better. Barely a reference to Daredevil and some fleeting glimpses of the death of Elektra's mother, the latter of which barely has any significance to the plot, beyond explaining why Elektra wants to protect Abby. More plot was needed, and what is it with almost every movie made these days in which the Lord's Name is taken in vain? "Thou shalt not take the Name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain." Hence the three stars.<br /><br />See it once.<br /><br />Rated PG-13 (intense action sequences, a strong religious profanity & some brief moderate language).</p></br><a href="../users/A2AK7ZFKW08HID.html">A2AK7ZFKW08HID</a><br/><p>I didnt think this movie was so bad. Yes the story is kind of slow but you can't deny that it picks up towards the end and I think it was well worth the wait. Take it for what it is and don't expect perfection and you will be surprised by the outcome.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>Being an Elektra fan, I was eager to seer this film. However, I must say that I am disappointed. This movie is not as faithful to its source material as it should be. Now of course, I know that movies are never exactly the same, and found myself satisfied with such films as Dune and The Color Purple, but this movie just didn't cut it.<br /><br />Nothing personal against Jennifer Garner, but I did not feel her appropriate for this role. She is not a bad actress per se, but this role was very unsuited for her, and the story itself isn't as much about Elektra as one would think. Overall, I can only give it 3/5 stars at best.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST.html">A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST</a><br/><p>Jennifer Garner reprises a major character in the Daredevil movie for this comic book-styled romp in the martial arts. Elektra (Garner) is a hired assassin who refuses to go forward with an assigned hit, which doesn't sit well with an evil organization.<br /><br />The shadows that twists and turns the soul of Elektra are not heavily delved into, as the focus is on action. Garner has a striking presence, but is underutilized due to the character never fully stepping away from the comics.<br /><br />The bonus material is outstanding, with a documentary on the character - which includes an interview with Frank Miller - and an in-depth "making of" documentary and film commentary by director Rob Bowman and editor Kevin Stitt.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, there was potential missed to turn Elektra into a solid movie franchise.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>I have to say that I am not familiar with any Daredevil or Elektra comics, games or had had any other contact with the characters apart from the two movies so I cannot compare the characters to other sources, nor can I take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have.  Therefore, coming from someone that did not "know" Elektra prior to the film I have to say that the movie was pretty good.<br />Jennifer Garner (who is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!!!) and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well, allowing for an entertaining movie.  On the negative side, there were several parts that were too predictable/obvious taking away from the overall enjoyment of the movie.<br />In short, the plot, the setting, the special effects, and the music are all good.<br />Overall, though not a masterpiece, it is definitely a movie worth watching, as it will provide for an evening's entertainment! 3.5 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A259F4J3QOBIUH.html">A259F4J3QOBIUH</a><br/><p>Ok, although I worked in a movie store, and I am usually a good judge of films (thus no need to review movies less than 3 stars, generally)...I bought it for the cover and a few previews.<br /><br />I thought that this movie would be an intense, butt kicking, action packed film with a hot chic superhero cutting her way through obstacles.  This movie has not left as strong of an impression in my mind, as most films do.  I only vaguely recall the plot and some rather boring scenes.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the actress is hot, and she does a little butt kicking, but if you want action I'd recommend movies with Milla Jovovich, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGGE68">Ultraviolet (Unrated, Extended Cut)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YPUFAQ">Resident Evil - The High-Definition Trilogy (Resident Evil/ Resident Evil: Apocalypse/ Resident Evil: Extinction) [Blu-ray</a>], etc., or Kate Beckinsale; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TGJ80I">Underworld (Unrated) [Blu-ray</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F6IOC0">Underworld - Evolution (Widescreen Special Edition)</a>, and obscure flicks such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EQ5V8G">Bloodrayne (Unrated Director's Cut)(DVD ROM game is included)</a>.<br /><br />Elektra was not very electrifying. I give it a "watch it once" rating, but I was not very impressed with the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>Hardly an entertaining sequel to Daredevil, this comix adventure focuses more on stunts than a coherent plotline or the execution of such plot. Welcomingly, the stunt sequences and the special effects are much more developed than in Daredevil, yet, it's not enough to save this movie. Jennifer Garner reprises all her mimics as Alias' Sydney Bristow, without the crucial vulnerability of that character. Goran Visinjic's acting talent is underused and he isn't on screen long enough to serve as eye candy.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Spin-offs are something of a rarity in Hollywood. Well, let me clarify that statement for a moment, spin-offs occur frequently in television, but with feature films they are far less common. When they have occurred in the movies they tend to not be as successful as the film or film series that inspired them. A few examples of spin-off feature films that had varying degrees of success or lack there of, are as follows: "The Scorpion King" (moderately successful), "Supergirl" (massive flop), and "Catwoman" (even worse than "Supergirl"). So, with only a couple of decent successes with spin-offs ("U.S. Marshals" would be another one), it strikes me as odd that 20th Century Fox would choose to make one based on their 2002 smash hit "Daredevil", instead of going with a direct sequel. Whatever the motivation, the decision was made to move forward with "Elektra", and the final product we were given was an average action movie, mixed with elements of other assassin-themed films, and almost no connection to the original film that introduced the titular character.<br /><br />"Elektra" picks up essentially where Elektra's story ended in "Daredevil", with her death at the hands of Bullseye. When all hope seemed lost, along comes a mysterious man named Stick (Terrence Stamp), a blind martial arts instructor that hopes to train and recruit Elektra to join him in an ongoing war against the evil organization known as The Hand. The Hand is also aware of Elektra and her abilities, and is just as interested in her joining their side as Stick is for his. However, Elektra's death and resurrection has left her cold, and she now uses the training she received from Stick as a means to become a world-renowned assassin. It's only a matter of time before Elektra's destiny catches up with her, and she will be forced to choose which side she will stand with.<br /><br />As I said before, I doubt I'll ever understand the reasoning behind going with a spin-off such as "Elektra" over making another "Daredevil" film. I know that Jennifer Garner's character of Elektra was popular, especially amongst male audience members; however, I have a hard time believing that the response to her character was so overwhelming to inspire the suits at Fox to believe in moving forward with a movie focused solely on her. I know that critics were unkind to "Daredevil", although movie audiences were much more in favor of the film; but based on box office returns and an almost universal panning by critics, I don't believe "Elektra" faired nearly as well as a "Daredevil 2" would have among moviegoers. So, I wonder now, can anyone at 20th Century Fox say the words "Colossal faux pas"?<br /><br />The problem with "Elektra" isn't only the fact that it didn't make all that much money, but that it just wasn't on the same level as "Daredevil" or anything else that Marvel was placing in theaters at the time, or since then for that matter. The storyline was very simplistic for the most part, and truthfully, when the story stayed simple, that's when it entertained the best. When the story broke away from the simple plot and tried to get too complicated, that's when things first began to suffer. This was caused by the writers attempt at including a paper-thin psychological sub-plot for Elektra to deal with. Another set of problems for "Elektra" were caused by the lack of originality, brought on by borrowing heavily from other assassin-themed movies such as "The Replacement Killers"; and lastly, all but severing all possible ties to the original film "Daredevil" that allowed this movie to happen in the first place. Now, the first two problems were troublesome enough to cause "Elektra" to lose points in my opinion; however, the almost complete omission of all things "Daredevil" bothers me the most. I know that many times spin-offs will not really do much to reference the original film(s) that created them, but most of those do not pick up part of their storyline wherever the original film left off. For that reason, I believe "Elektra" should have contained more than just a fleeting reference to the events of "Daredevil", and had they done so, I probably would have enjoyed this movie a lot more than I did.<br /><br />I'm sure after reading that previous paragraph that you are probably thinking that I barely enjoyed "Elektra". Well, for some unexplained reason (and that's the God's honest truth, I have no logical explanation for why), I actually did moderately enjoy "Elektra". It doesn't make sense to me at all, but there's just something about it that still appeals to me, regardless of all the problems I have with it, several of which I listed above. I'm sure the appeal of this movie has something to do with the fact that Jennifer Garner ("13 Going on 30") stars in it, but I know that can't be the only reason, because if that were the case, I'd enjoy "Catwoman" due to Halle Berry ("X-Men: The Last Stand"), and believe me there is no enjoying that movie at all. The only thing I can come up with is that "Elektra" is simply one of my "Guilty Pleasure" movies and nothing more.<br /><br />Speaking of Jennifer Garner, she is one of the few bright spots for this movie, and I appreciated that she chose to reprise her role. Not to mention donning the bright red, skin tight leather costume this time around. I'm sure that the writers of the film, and probably even director Rob Bowman ("Reign of Fire"), had good intentions of giving Jennifer more to do than just appear somber and angry throughout the movie, in her defense she did always look great while acting as if she could kill you at any second, and no doubt the inclusion of the muddled psychological story for her character was an attempt to challenge Jennifer. However, even the best intentions can't always make things right, because aside from receiving a paycheck and having fun kicking butt onscreen again, based on what little else she had to do in the movie, I can't see any reason Jennifer would have for returning to this role.<br /><br />Alongside Jennifer Garner, the rest of the performances in the film were a mixture in quality, with very few worthy of note; and almost all across the board everyone appeared somewhat disconnected from the material. I don't know if a majority of the cast was given instructions to be flat when giving their line readings or what, but something definitely did not feel right much of the time. The only other cast member, besides Jennifer Garner, that I enjoyed having in the movie was Terrence Stamp ("Superman 2") as Elektra's mysterious mentor, Stick. For some reason, I enjoyed watching him, and it wasn't that he did a whole heck of a lot; it's just the way in which he carries himself, just seems to command attention.<br /><br />One thing is for certain though; "Elektra" is by no means a great movie, in fact there were moments when I watched it that I found myself wondering if it's just barely above average. But, in the end I do feel that the movie does a decent job of entertaining me, and for that reason, as I said earlier, it warrant's itself a place in my favor as a guilty pleasure and not much more.<br /><br />On a side note, 20th Century Fox did give "Elektra" the same treatment they gave to "Daredevil" by releasing a Director's Cut of the film on DVD. Truthfully, I don't know how much was added or was different from the theatrical release, but it does seem like there is slightly more story included, and the movie seemed to work just a little bit better.<br /><br />"Elektra" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.<br />"Elektra: The Director's Cut" is unrated and contains violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>If there was an award handed out to the film with the most wasted potential, there would be several winners this year, but one of the runners up would be the film Elektra.  While there were some decent action sequences coupled with some very impressive villains, it was ultimately the unrealistic story and constantly changing characters that will leave your head lost in the clouds.  Throughout the film, Garner's character of Elektra is never defined.  As often as the scenery changes in this film, as does Garner's portrayal of Elektra.  One moment she is this heartless killer, and within a few short minutes, she is the most compassionate creature to be released by the comics.  It literally made no sense.  Who was she?  What was her true purpose?  Why (this is always a good question)?  Was she looking for compassion and love?  I have no clue, and this film took no effort to disclose the truth.  Instead, we are forced to jump back and forth trying to decipher these basic elements that were never covered in this film.  Couple with this some evil villains that were aesthetically pleasing to the eye, but that is all and you have the butchered comic release of Elektra.<br /><br />My initial thought about this film was that director Rob Bowman didn't do enough research on this character to correctly bring her to life.  I have personally never read any of the comics, but I did see the film Daredevil, and I must admit Garner did provide the perfect opportunity to avoid looking at Ben Affleck, and I must say that I was interested in seeing how she was going to expand her character.  Let me tell you how she did it ... she took away any boundaries and borders.  Garner created this character that floated through each scene without creating any substance.  At one point she would be ruthless, then mere seconds later, Garner would show some sympathy towards one of the characters that would surpassingly seem out of character, because instantly she would transform back.  There was no definition with her Elektra, which allowed for confusion and miscommunication to those involved in watching this film.  Perhaps Garner wasn't quite comfortable in this role, or maybe the writing just didn't allow her to fully define herself.  Whatever it was it transformed Garner from this encrypted character to just a fumbled mess of thoughts.<br /><br />With this said, one can also complain that this problem also occurred with the villains of this film.  I was so excited to finally see colorful and purely evil villains, that my excitement slowly died upon witnessing nothing happening with them.  There was no story, there was no moment of evil, there was nothing except a short glance of their faces followed by no lines coupled with impending death.  These guys were tough, and they had some superhero powers that Garner didn't even acknowledge.  It was yet again another glowing example of Rob Bowman not following through with the image of the comics and giving us "dead" characters.  After witnessing the "flip-floppery" of Elektra, I wasn't expecting it from the villains, but somehow they just appeared.  It then became apparent what Bowman had done wrong.  His focus was not on Elektra or her arch-nemesis, but instead of the graphics that were being created.  The story was weak, and I think Bowman knew that, so he spent a majority of his money on the CGI aspects of the film.  Which, strangely, worked.<br /><br />I must give this film some credit, and that would be solely to the special effects crew.  I thought visually this film was entertainment, but when you opened your ears, the remaining element just forced this film to crash and burn.  Bowman knew how to make a visually appealing film, and he succeeded, but if he could have continued to add a very exciting and unfaltering story line, then he would have had a masterpiece.  Instead, we are left with a horrible portrayal of Elektra by Garner, coupled with the cheesy Terrence Stamp moments that seem to all-so-well accompany the weakest, yet visually stunning, baddies this world has ever seen.  It was just a hodge-podge of troubles, and at the helm was director Rob Bowman.<br /><br />Overall, I wasn't impressed at all.  There were moments during this film where I thought it was going to go to a whole new level, but instead it just created a double negative effect.  In essence, the "fun" scenes were cancelled out by less important, nearly muted scenes.  Garner tried, but ultimately failed as this superhero.  She had the potential to really take this character to new levels, but thanks to the backward mind of Rob Bowman, she was unsuccessful.  I truly believe that the focus in this feature was pointed in the wrong direction, do not give us the best camera shot known to man, but instead powerful characters and a believable (and less Hollywood) plot.  This will give us a stronger character in the long run.  The largest disappointment to this film was the characters that felt as if they were forgotten about.  While I will never say that Daredevil was a better picture, but there are plenty of comic book films that do a better job of bringing their images to life.  Skip this one and go see Sin City.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A13H7Q4JVK6DTV.html">A13H7Q4JVK6DTV</a><br/><p>When this movie starts it starts out slow because of elektra going through some kind of mental disorder, but you shouldn't blame her she is an Assassin which makes her interesting.As the movie gets going so does the action which is pretty good.Is this movie worth buying yeah it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2.html">A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2</a><br/><p>I thought this movie was okay, but it seemed to be missing something.

Also starring Terence Stamp (The Limey, Poor Cow), Gorn Visnjic (E.R., Close Your Eyes) and Jason Isaacs (The Patriot, Event Horizon). For diehard Garner fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3SXHT6RBV81.html">A2F3SXHT6RBV81</a><br/><p>This is a spin-off from 'Daredevil' as a combination of fantasy and science fiction, with a female "urban legend" of comics who is a lost soul with no place to go, nowhere to turn. That's as close as this movie gets to real life.  As I recall, 'Daredevil' in his red leather outfit donned his disguise to help mankind in his mission to avenge his father's death. In this production of Regency Pictures using Marvel Comics, the female protagonist in her skimpy red outfit is a high paid killer with an analytical mind who seeks to avenge the murder of her mother. Thus, the tables are turned.<br /><br />In this allegory of the ancient war between good and evil, he chose the good, she the evil. She was told by her teacher, a member of the group HAND, that some lessons can't be taught; you must live them to be understood. He is convinced that she is poisoned by hate but has a 'pure' heart.  Terence Stamp made a good leader named aptly 'Stick' who is a holdover from "Daredevil' where he taught the hero how to fight. Here, he does the same for Elektra and later young Abby Miller.  Mark Miller was played by Goran Visnjic of ER fame, a dead-ringer for the young, handsome Robert Downey, Jr., whose star has faded. He was the only character seemingly human. His daugher, 13-yr-old Abby, has a criminal mind and believes the adage that nobody tells the truth about themselves.<br /><br />All humans make mistakes, but these demonic comic-book characters were not human. I have the theory that this movie is not totally fantasy: there are such demons among us in plain sight.  Apparently raised from the dead in 'Daredevil,' she does the same for Abby. She had become emotionally involved with Mark and saw in rebellious Abby the 'young girl she once was.' She knew firsthand that life was not always going to be a bowl of cherries, nor would it turn out to be a bowl of sour grapes either.<br /><br />There are some unusual special effects, and the machinegun violence and weird confrontations were a little much. Tatoo was all snakes, just one of the demonic assassins sent by the Council of the HAND to finish the job Elekta chose not to do and find the 'treasure.' He almost demolished what he was sent to do.  Location shots at a monastery (indoor and outdoors) were lavish. Everything was foreign to me, since I've never read this genre of comic books (I debate the connotation 'comic' in this type of violent illustrated media.) and I was shaken to the core. The director did his job well, as did the actors, but I doubt I will attend this type of production again. To me, comic means something to make you laugh and feel good. This film had the opposite effect.</p></br><a href="../users/A30LMTLC9XVWKJ.html">A30LMTLC9XVWKJ</a><br/><p>Although forewarned, I was not totally prepared for just how staggeringly bad this thing actually was. But in fairness I had to actually see it to believe it, because the suck level is beyond anything I could have imagined. Think about the producers of the second "Charlie's Angels" movie doing a remake of "Enter the Dragon" (with the Angels cast) and you get some idea of "Elektra". Wherever the $40 plus million budget ended up, it was not on the screen.<br /><br />Even from its inception the idea was suspect. Since "Daredevil" occupies pretty much the lowest rung on the superhero ladder, that makes "Electra's" status subterranean; they truly were scraping the bottom of the barrel. Add to this a really lame script (most cartoons have more subtle story lines and better dialog), uninteresting production design, poor lighting, and really bad direction and you can at least figure out why it is so bad.<br /><br />But that leaves the mystery of why a studio, whose goal is to make (not lose) money, ever gave a green-light to the project. In may be that since comic titles like "Elektra" are basically sexploitation, the money people looked at the casting of Jennifer Garner and Natassia Malthe and saw huge sexploitation potential. Unfortunately someone forgot to tell this to the director and the DP because the filming of the two actresses is totally sterile (and they wonder why this thing lost money).<br /><br />The movie's fight scenes suffer from ADD; each shot is a nanosecond long which negates any need for stunt work. choreography, or effects. There's even a showdown sequence where a bunch of laundry fights with the actors. At least this is original although it might have been used once in a "Charlie Chan" movie.<br /><br />Jennifer Garner looks confused most of the time. Like they did a lot of tight shots on her face in the studio and then cut them randomly into action footage produced by the second unit. These reaction shots just make her look totally clueless. I was  surprised by how old she looks, hard to believe she is only 33. She has clearly outgrown this type of role and I felt embarrassed for her.<br /><br />It seems inconceivable that "anyone" would find this entertaining although apparently a few people actually liked it.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VLX5Z090RQ0V.html">A3VLX5Z090RQ0V</a><br/><p>I was watching the director's cut of the film and thinking, "Wow, this is violent".  People were getting pierced through the chest, blood was seeping in the weapons, and there was a brief decapitation, yet why were the bad guys turn into green smoke when they're killed?  The movie never explained why they evaporate into green gas, so there's no point for the violent director's cut to not just leave them as corpses.  It's about as pointless as the making of this movie.<br /><br />"Elektra" is an underwhelming, unnecessary spinoff to a below-par superhero movie.  There isn't much to tell about Elektra that I should care about, it's just another boring revenge/redemption tale that's already been told in "Daredevil".  It started off with a pointless entry scene when she assassinated some guy, and then she was tasked to kill a family of two but then she suddenly had a change of heart due to mommy issues and thus she's defending them while fighting against the one that killed her family (or at least her mother, it never showed what happened to her pappy).  I never really liked the daughter and father of the targeted family, the daughter comes off as selfish, even after the revelation about her was given, while the father is for the most part irrelevant.  These two are mostly there to intrude Elektra's actions, and characters who interfere are never likable.  As for the villains, members of The Hand, it's amazing how they're initially portrayed as a powerful force and the organization became less relevant as the plot goes on, leading to only a few baddies taking action.  The supervillains actually look cool in design (except for that Poison Ivy rip-off), that Tattoo guy given special notice, but how they're defeated was very anti-climatic.<br /><br />The plot is secondary to special effects, and even then, the special effects were poorly done.  They tried too hard to show off, and a couple of effects were blatantly obviously like the bracelet attack by a certain character.  Most of the effects are even impractical, like how that main villain can quick-dash which leaves a trail and yet why doesn't he used that technique AND attack his foe at the same time.  A lot of characters used that quick move to appear and reappear on screen, yet I find that to be a lazy effect.  As lousily-written and below-par "Elektra" is, it does have one incredible moment worth mentioning: an evil ninja breaking his own neck without using his limbs; that was the best part of the whole movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>'Elektra' is a throughly enjoyable comic book style action/adventure. Jennifer Garner is terrific as Elektra, a ninja assassin turned protector of a single father (Goran Visnijic) and his daughter (Kristen Prout), a martial arts prodigy known as "the Treasure".<br /><br />'Elektra' boasts a strong storyline, excellent cast and enough martial arts, mysticism and occultic themes to keep most fans of this genre of film satisfied.<br /><br />Also starring Terence Stamp and Cary Hiroyuki Taqawa.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>I admit that the special effects were great. But the story needs a lot of work. And I kind of doubt that after this whole big war that the bad guys could be finished off that easily. But, at least the dialogue was fluid and the fights were well-choreograpghed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I didn't think this movie was horrible but the one thing that stands out for somebody who read the graphic novel Elektra Lives, and Elktra Assassin and followed the character in the comic books is the total miscasting of Jennifer Garner as Elektra. The girl is physically fit and has the body and the moves but she is just a poor actress and does not fit the part of the Greek assassin. That said, Terrance Stamp is good as Stick her mentor but they do not portray him anything like the character in the comics. The character of Stick was a foul mouthed mentor who would as soon cuss Elektra or anybody out as look at them. They add Typhoid Mary, a really cool character and played by a beautiful actress, that wasn't even in the Elektra comics but in Daredevil. They also don't portray the character as she was written, a homocidal schizophrenic who is a mousey Mary and then turns into a crazy serial killer Typhoid who hates men. Stone, is portrayed as an indestructable hulk of a man but again they go against the comic by making him part of The Hand, the evil Ninja clan, when in the comic he was with Stick and The Chaste. Garner is just not right for the part. She doesn't have the look and the costume is weak.<br /><br />All that said, if you didn't read the comic you probably will at least find it an entertaining action flick on some level. Its worth seeing just a complete let down to this Elektra fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>"Elektra" is one of the weakest entries into Marvel's recent string of films based on their comics.  I'm basing that statement on the fact that I've seen all of these films (from "Blade" to "Fantastic Four" and all of the adaptations and sequels in between, including both "Punisher" flicks).  Although it is a step above "Hulk" and miles above Dolph Lundgren's version of "Punisher," this film isn't quite as good as the film that it was born from, "Daredevil."  Granted, "Daredevil" wasn't a real gem compared to its peers, but the character did have a lot more development than found in this film.<br /><br />"Elektra" starts off fine enough, with a high body count that is sure to get any action fan a little giddy.  However, after this initial look at Jennifer Garner's title character at work, we are dumped into a long, drawn out and quite dull series of flashbacks and a sad attempt at the development of a plot.  When the action is on, this film is at its best, although some of the kung-foolery gets a little silly at times (especially the fight involving way too many bedsheets).  There are plenty of villains, but no one ultimate baddie.  Collectively, the villains are known as the Hand.  I'd love to have seen Elektra go at it with Cary Hiroyuki-Tagawa's character, who really seems to be a bad guy in the wings.  Instead, Garner tackles a motley crew of a tattooed warrior, a chick with really strong breath, and a murdering ninja with lightning-fast moves, as well as a number of other, lesser villains.<br /><br />In the end, the viewer is left wondering just exactly what happened.  Why was Elektra so quick to protect the young girl and her father?  She had no clue why the Hand were after them initially.  Why couldn't she finish off some of the Hand while they were tracking their target?  She finished many of them off quite quickly when she put her mind to it.  There are a few other questions I could mention, but they may reveal too much.<br /><br />In closing, this is a ho-hum flick that tries too hard to be both an intellectual film with all of the flashbacks and an action flick.  What you end up with is a fluffy action flick with almost no plot development and zero character development.  In fact, this film had an advantage over other first films for comic characters:  no need to develop the main character.  That was done in "Daredevil," which I have to give credit for building up two superheroes in one film.  That's the one thing that all comic flicks have to fight with initially.  "Elektra" didn't even use that to its advantage.  Instead, it played out as if it was looking for a plot, or at least a good reason, for our heroine to do what she did during the film.<br /><br />I only recommend this flick as a purchase to hardcore "Elektra" fans.  You may want to buy it if you, like me, are a completionist and just have to have every Marvel flick on DVD.  Otherwise I'd rent this film before laying any cash money down for it.  It's okay, but there are plenty of better comic flicks out there to purchase.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Elektra brings the audience down the beaten path of the fight between good and evil.  The struggle between good and evil is an infamous theme in storytelling, as it teaches moral values that emphasize kindness, forgiveness, and compassion.  Despite being a frequently recurring theme, it has a solid value to its audience, as it provides new perspectives of the wolf in sheep's clothing and continues to foster goodness in people.  Elektra tries to offer such a lesson through a troubled woman, who still lives in the past, as anger clouds her thoughts.<br /><br />The good are represented by an organization led by the blind martial arts master Stick (Terence Stamp) who once taught the main character, Elektra (Jennifer Garner), to become a lethal killer that she is.  This might sound counter-productive, but the good side once tried to turn Elektra to one of their leading fighters against the ancient battle against evil.  This evil is led by Roshi (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) who is the leader of the feared organization called the Order of the Hand.  Yet, they are not as fearsome as one wishes in order to generate a suspenseful atmosphere.<br /><br />Once the audience settles down with the main theme, the film introduces a myriad of side plots.  For example, Elektra has a troubled past, her obsessive-compulsive disorder seems like a way of survival, her job is as a hired assassin, and other character's have secrets.  There is also the Hands' pursuit for warriors to tip the balance in their favor such as Elektra while puzzlement surrounds Stick's relationship to Elektra.  These are many of the plots provided in the film, which reminds the audience of a crossroads with several directions to choose.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the director does not develop these side plots or the characters. Instead, the filmmaker brings the audience through a rapid succession of images that are supposed to suggest ideas, thoughts, or something.  It feels as if much of the potpourri of thoughts diverges into a messy conundrum where much makes sense, but does not finish or offer any kind of message regarding how Elektra reaches her final solutions.  Much of it feels as if it is grabbed straight out of the air leaving the audience with a hollow and fabricated idea.  In addition, Elektra's choices occasionally seem to go against her character, and she does not seem to be the strong person that she is supposed to be.  This truly hurts the cinematic experience, as it does not provide a vision or meaning behind Elektra, the Hand, or others in the film.<br /><br />The films is nicely shot with some intriguing cinematography, yet some of it will remind the audience about films such as Hero (2002) and House of Flying Daggers (2004) by Yimou Zhang.  There is also a little of Matrix (1999) slow motion in the film, which does not provide any real unique experience.  Ultimately, Elektra will make the audience experience a trivial super hero film while the character Elektra deserves a much better developed story that does not feel cluttered, or borrowed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I was looking forward to see "Elektra" on DVD since I missed it in theaters, so I rented it today and I am glad I resisted purchasing this one. Jennifer Garner looks good and all (hence the 2 stars instead of 1), but even that can't save the lame story, dialogue, and special effects. This is truly one of the worst comic book adaptations ever and shares that spot with Halle Berry's "Catwoman". If you want to see an extremely great comic book film, go out and witness the masterpiece "Sin City" which I have already seen twice. That film is worth your time and money, so pass on Elektra. You have been warned!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>First off the fact that this movie got made before an Iron-Man, Thor,Captain American and The Avengers, and the list goes on movies is ridiculous!I thought Daredevil was good, it could have been better,but I was fairly happy with the end result. I bought the director's cut ,but have not gotten around to watching it yet.I have heard it is much better than the original. OK now back to Electra. This movie is boring, stupid, poorly acted and.....do I need to continue? They should have worked on Daredevil 2 instead of this piece of garbage! Unless your a completest Marvel movie nut,avoid this one at all cost!</p></br><a href="../users/A37PV5GMP2ILJC.html">A37PV5GMP2ILJC</a><br/><p>For pure entertainment value, I thought this was a great movie.  Good vs. Evil, female superhero with hot red costume, villains with magical powers, martial arts action, dreamy fight scenes a la "Hero" and a valuable treasure to be protected.<br /><br />On the surface, this movie swept me away with its action sequences and special effects, but then I got to thinking, and that kind of spoiled it for me.<br /><br />Elektra (Jennifer Garner) at the beginning of the movie was the coolest thing in red ever.  She was like Trinity (Carrie Ann Moss) from the first Matrix movie, unstoppable, inhuman, focused and deadly, plus she looked darned good in that outfit with her hair swinging around.<br /><br />As the story goes, suffering from a bit of burnout, she accepts one more assignment, and then suddenly has a change of heart when she receives her hit list.  From here on, the writers strip away her intrigue and mystique, and it was disappointing to see a superhero suffer from OCD and insomnia, depend on an agent instead of a trusty butler, and generally get less and less super and more and more vulnerable.  She doesn't even don the red body hugger again until the end of the movie.<br /><br />The bad guys then begin pursuing her new acquaintances, and she assumes a bodyguard role without even asking why one man and his daughter would be worth the effort.  After a lot of ta-da, she ends up back at the training camp of her sensei, who although blind like all good mentors, is not an inscrutable Asian with a long moustache, but a cranky white dude named Stick (Terrence Stamp).<br /><br />This brings us to the best part of the movie, with a group of villains with real superpowers, who of course choose to attack one by one so that the good guys can save the day. Kirigi (Will Yun Lee) is a real martial artist, and two-sworded leader of the bunch; Typhoid (Natassia Malthe) can kill with a touch, and she almost sucks the life out of Elektra with a lingering kiss; Stone (Bob Sapp) is like The Thing, skin like armor and built like a barn; Kinkou (Edson Ribeiro) comes and goes quickly, and Tattoo (Chris Ackerman) is by far the most magical, with body tattoos with lives of their own.  These guys make the movie worth watching, and it's really sad to see them go.<br /><br />Kirsten Prout handles herself very well as Abby Miller, the young girl that looks up to Elektra, and has a secret of her own, but Goran Visnjic doesn't have the satisfaction of a solid role to stand on.<br /><br />Enjoy this one for the action, but don't pause to think about the plot.<br /><br />On the side of good<br /><br />Elektra wields a mean sai<br /><br />To save the treasure<br /><br />Amanda Richards, July 24, 2005</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I loved Daredevil, so much so that I have both the original release, and the director's cut on DVD. Hopefully, there will be a director's cut of this too, as many other reviewers have mentioned, there's a lot of stuff where it appears that scenes have been taken out.<br /><br />Elektra is a stand alone film, and you don't need to have seen Daredevil first before seeing this. There are flashbacks in this, but not to Daredevil, it references Elektra's mum dying when she was young, which wasn't mentioned in Daredevil. The only real reference to Daredevil is seeing Elektra's character coming back to life after being killed by Bullseye. Many people have said there should have been a reference to Daredevil, or a cameo by Ben Affleck. But the good thing about this movie is it stands alone. It would have changed the entire movie if Daredevil had been referenced. And as for a Ben Affleck cameo - hello people, can I mention that there are deleted scenes on the DVD?! Yes, Ben Affleck DOES have a cameo in the movie as Matt Murdoch, but it was quite rightly cut from the movie, as it probably would have ruined it, and puzzled viewers who hadn't seen Daredevil. It also hints that Elektra may return to Matt, which was also hinted at, at the end of Daredevil anyway. I hope she does. (And here was me getting worried, as while they were filming, Ben was on set, but spent a lot of time with Jennifer in her trailer, while he was still with Jennifer Lopez, the naughty boy - but they're now together!)<br /><br />Jennifer Garner is gorgeous, and even more so in this, than in some of her other movies. Of course, in this, she's wearing (for her assassin scenes anyway) a bright red, and very tight outfit. She's a guy's wet dream in this movie - and admitting in interviews that she couldn't wear any underwear sent the male viewers heads spinning! She is incredibly fit to have taken part in this movie, as she does a lot more fight scenes than she did for Daredevil. Yet her hair never moves while she's fighting, and it's very obviously extensions. Her makeup is perfect too, giving her the sculpted cheekbones look - you didn't really think that was real did you guys?! It takes work to get cheekbones like that! (Says she who doesn't have any!) I'm surprised there's not been rumours about Jen's lips, as they're very full lips, but they're all real, although at some points during her movies, they do come across as looking very fake. But look at Angelina Jolie, Steve Tyler, and that old guy from Rolling Stones, they're famous for their lips. Jennifer also has a great on-screen prescene, and she commands your attention from the first moment she appears. She's got something a lot of her peers don't.<br /><br />The cast are brilliant in this, with Goran Visnjic and Kirsten Prout performing well. Kirsten performs extremely well, even looking like Jennifer at some points, plus she's a "prodigy" as described during the movie. Look at this girl go! I found the bad guys extremely one-dimensional, and they could have done with some fleshing out. And for lethal assassins, Elektra has a pretty easy time killing them off. There's four of them in total: Tattoo (a guy who's tattoos quite literally come to life - I hope mine doesn't!), Stone (another guy who bears a striking resemblence to Michael Clarke Duncan, and the name says it all), Typhoid (who can kill with a single touch), and some other martial arts guy, who Elektra's met before, but doesn't really have any special abilities apart from being lightning fast. Especially for the guys there's a girl-on-girl between Elektra & Typhoid, when she tries to kill her. This was completely unnecessary, as it was shown earlier in the movie that Typhoid can kill with just her fingers, so why on earth did she kiss Jennifer (for ages might I add) to kill her?! I'm sorry, it wouldn't be a turn on to see two guys kiss, so why is it for two girls?!<br /><br />Due to the low level response from the previous film Daredevil, promotion for this movie claimed ties to the movie X-Men instead, which had a much higher popularity response. The first promotional mention of ties to the Daredevil movie only took place one week before the Elektra movie was to be released. There's a lot of X-Men in this movie actually, from kids trying to hide their special powers, to the special effects, and the bad guys, with their special powers. It all screams X-Men, which isn't such a bad thing, but it's missing a hunk like Wolverine! :)<br /><br />The film seems cut down a lot, which in an interview with UK's Empire Online, director Rob Bowman stated that the original director's cut was a R-rated film and he had to tone the film down (due to contractual obligations). So personally, I'm crossing my fingers for a director's cut of this. I feel, much like the director's cut of Daredevil, while adding to the film (although it took away the love scene between Jen & Ben), it slowed it down a lot, and the same for this as well. There's a lot of unnecessary scenes, and not enough time devoted to the bad guys. The 'romance' (and by romance, I mean a chaste peck) between Goran & Jennifer seems awkward almost, and you can't help but think of Matt. The OCD thing is also brilliant, organising everything, and counting while she walks.<br /><br />The extras are quite good and include: deleted scenes; a making-of; comic-con presentation; trailers, and inside the editing room, with Rob Bowman. There's also an inside look at Fox's next movies, Fantastic Four and Mr & Mrs Smith, both of which look excellent!<br /><br />I definitely think this film should be seen at least once, if not for the story (if you hated Daredevil, you'll love this or hate it) then for Jennifer herself. I'm sure there's plenty of guys tongues hanging out everywhere while watching this.<br /><br />Sweet dreams boys.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>I thought Daredevil was an absolutely pointless film with anonymous direction and an unappealing, non-unapalling lead actor. Thankfully, Elektra has a prettier lead and stronger direction from Rob Bowman, who seems to have ditched the slimy creature effects he seemed so fond of in X-Files and Reign of Fire.<br /><br />Daredevil is nowhere near as popular in the collective public conscience as Spiderman or even the Hulk. So imagine why Elektra failed at the Box Office. The whole world saw the poster and thought 'Who is she supposed to be?'. Either that or they saw the horrible, highly cliched trailer that totally misrepresented the film.<br /><br />The resulting critical mauling by just about everyone wasn't completely fair nor was it completely unexpected. The film reeks of deleted scenes and subplots that have been completely cut out. It fades out at the 90-minute mark, leaving us wondering why they even bothered.<br /><br />However, what we do get is a mild, but nonetheless entertaining action movie with an almost constant spooky atmosphere. The plot is meagre and many of the subs and tangents are never explained or developed. Or they were then got cut out in the editing room (along with Ben Affleck, thankfully)? If they got Frank Miller (he did create the character after all!) to write the script instead of 3 nobodies then it could have been something special.<br /><br />The DVD is in crisp 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with loud, sometimes dynamic Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound. Besides a trailer for the new Family Guy series the extras are of the usual 'whogivesadamn' lot.<br /><br />Perhaps a future directors cut will improve the film, but as it is Elektra is hardly brilliant, but definitely an above average brainless movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A38I00SO3D9ZSM.html">A38I00SO3D9ZSM</a><br/><p>I put off seeing this movie for over two years because it had been so widely panned by both critics and moviegoers.  But, I  rented it as part of a two-for-one deal at my local videostore and was glad I did.<br /><br />Is Elektra a great movie?  No.  But it's good.  Make no mistake, Batman Begins was a better film all the way around, but Elektra had similar elements, particularly in the back stories (both heroes lost parents when they were young, both were trained in ninjitsu and other martial arts.)  Elektra was a bit darker, for lack of a better term, than other Marvel comics-turned films such as The Hulk, X-Men or The Fantastic Four.<br /><br />In essence, Elektra is a martial arts film.  It has many asian elements and themes.  While many comic book superheroes acquire their powers by mutation, radiation or some other technological disaster or circumstance, Elektra's powers are mystical and learned, giving the story an eastern, not western, flavor.<br /><br />The action sequences are well done.  The scenes are nicely shot.  Very little of what takes place is so unbelievable as to be silly or ridiculous.  Jennifer Garner brings much of Alias to this role but it works.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would buy this movie but it's worth a rental, especially if you like action/adventure films.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ.html">A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ</a><br/><p>This movie is terrible. It is all about this girl Elektra who keeps on getting into fights. Maybe if she lost a few she would enrol in some much needed Anger Management Classes. It is interesting to note that according to Psychiatric Terminology an "Elektra Complex" is when a father wants to have sexual relations with his daughter which is pretty sick and so is this movie. I just read that Jennifer Garner has been voted for an Emmy which was a big surprise to me because I personally don't think she could emote  even after falling off a cliff. I guess some guys just can't see further than a pretty face and a good body.I give this movie 5 stars because thankfully it only ran for 1 1/2 hours.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>The inevitable spin-off of Daredevil, Elektra had gone through so many script re-writes that the final version hardly has any resemblance to Frank Miller's cold blooded assassin for hire, and instead we get a jumbled, fantasy-esque, predictable actioner with Alias star Jennifer Garner returning as Elektra.  There's really not much to say about the story, because there really isn't much of one, other than Elektra is resurrected and is soon protecting a man (Goran Visnjic) and his teen daughter from the Hand.  Fans who are familiar with Frank Miller's monumental Daredevil stories, in which he created and introduced Elektra, will be familiar with many of the characters; including Stick (Terrance Stamp), Typhoid Mary (Natissia Malthe), and Kirigi (Will Yun Lee), but those same fans will no doubt be wondering what those Daredevil characters are doing in Elektra.  I expected better from director Rob Bowman (Reign of Fire, the X-Files movie), but he probably didn't have much say in the matter.  All in all, Elektra is worth a look for comic fans, but don't expect anything good from it.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>Man, Jennifer garner comes back to us In "Elektra," this bad ass chick has another chance at life to do what she wants and she does.

I'm pretty sure they were mostly damning with faint praise. After all Jennifer, while certainly an attractive female, came across as a sorority pledge playing dress-up on S and M rush night.<br /><br />In Elektra she looks even more ridiculous. There have been plenty of great female assassins over the years from the camp of a Bond villain, to the seductiveness of Linda Fiorentino, even the girl next-door deadliness of Bridget Fonda in Point of No Return. Female assassins are a wonderful staple of filmdom, seductive yet deadly. Garner is neither. "She looks like she is thinking of puppies," claimed one reviewer I read and I concur. If the Smurfs were X-rated ninja's, then Garner would still be miscast in Smurfette: Deadly Blue.<br /><br />Her costumes certainly don't help her cause. You almost have the urge to tell her to put some clothes on and bright red Victoria Secret lingerie just doesn't scream stealth or deadly. Lord knows the rest of this mess doesn't help Garner either.<br /><br />While Terrance Stamp can do no wrong every else seems either miscast or afraid of stealing Garner's thunder. Add on poor special effects, villains that turn into family friendly yellow smoke when killed, ninjas that crash through windows like Army rangers, gas stoves that explode like nuclear weapons, laundry fu, Japanese villains out of a World War 2 propaganda film and my personal favorite the warmest Christmas in Canadian history.<br /><br />The movie clearly takes place in the northwest United States or Vancouver. The days are long, everyone is in short sleeves, and Garner takes recreational swims in the lake. (Canadian Lakes are notoriously cold even in August mind you) So when a cherub faced character asks Garner over for Christmas dinner Elektra isn't the only one surprised.<br /><br />Garner is sexy but when it's time to kill she should either get dressed or let the grown-ups take care of things.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PMQH87R1H3QU.html">A2PMQH87R1H3QU</a><br/><p>This movie is another movie, just like "CAT WOMAN" with halle berry and was sucked..<br />Now this one is call "Elektra" is same lame movie just like cat women with deferent name. Just put that way  " both sucked", even in box office, So go figure!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGB4HN3QCGAL.html">A3DGB4HN3QCGAL</a><br/><p>Not having seen this movie in the theatre I bought a copy mainly because the TV spots looked good.<br /><br />Somehow the story seemed slow moving and not a lot to it. I don't know how closely the plot might follow the comic books (apparently even they have changed over time)but I found that watching Jennifer Garner was the best part of it, she did very well as her character. The action scenes were interesting but there was a lot of talk and flashback stuff that just dragged it down for me.<br /><br />Elektra's abandoned childhood home, I noticed that it still had electricity and the gas was on in the kitchen, that looked like a flaw to me. The furniture sheets battle in that big room looked a little bit computer generated but interesting. I did like the extras included, seeing how some of the movie was made helped out a little.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>Even though Elektra had died in Daredevil already, but here she is revived by the wise and powerful Stick, a martial arts specialist played by Terance Stamp. He also trained her to become a more powerful fighter, and she was stronger and better by the time she headed out on her own again. Jennifer Gardner is impressive, and it's obvious that she's done a lot of training for the title role this time.<br /><br />Elecktra is haunted by traumatic past events and she's depressed and isolated. She came across a Abby, a teenaged girl and her dad in an remote island where she lived. Abby is the "treasure" meaning she's a martial arts protegee, and is being pursued by The Hand, a group of powerful evil people with special black-magics. Stick and his team is also secretly trying to protect and take the girl in for training. While protecting the girl, Elecktra had no idea of her identity until much later when the girl started to fight the villians.<br /><br />The first half of this film is rather slow, and had very little fight scenes. The good battles are concentrated in the second  half, which had some good special effects. The villians all took their even share of screentime and fight scenes, and Elektra took on them on a at time. Terance Stamp is vastly underused in this movie, he didn't even have to do any fight scenes. Goran Visnjic(The Deep End) played Abby's father, and had love scenes with Elektra. His role was unfortunately underwritten and irrelevant to the story that he's best effort was not even working here.<br /><br />Even though Ben Affleck didn't make an appearance in the film, but he did have a deleted scene in the special feature.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T2MYZEB81NOQ.html">A2T2MYZEB81NOQ</a><br/><p>I saw this movie with one of my friends. We'd both give it a nice, juicy 10 out of 10. It had terrific fight scenes, a cool plot, grand villains, and Elektra herself was so beautiful it's not even funny! There was quite a lot of humor in it, as well. One of the best. See it and you'll have done yourself the greatest favor this side of female movies!</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>One of the best, most exhilirating and purely Enjoyable movies around.  Admittedly it's not as plausible as some of the other comic book adaptations have managed to be (the "X-Men" movies and especially "Batman Begins", for example), requiring a couple of suspensions of disbelief here and there (though I'd contend that it comes off as more believable than, say, the James Bond or Rambo series).  That's not a putdown on those movies but they're not trying to be ultra-realistic, and neither is this.  What it is going for, and succeeds at much better than most action movies in my opinion, is to be a rocket ride with a plot and engaging characters.  It's sexy, it's intense at the right times, sweet and tender at the right times, mysterious at the right times, and explosive allout action at the right times, with a welcome romantic angle and with good humor without becoming an unfortunate self-parody.<br /><br />To be honset, it's not really accurate to the comic book version of Elektra (neither was her portrayal in "Daredevil") but that wasn't a fatal flaw with me like it would be with some other comic adaptations - the first four live-action "Batman"s for example - five if you count the 60s one - were technically well done (uh, 3 of them were anyway.  The other 2 I felt missed the mark even on a technical level) but were disappointing because I wanted something far closer to the comics (and finally got it this summer!)  Elektra, on the other hand, I've read some of the books she's in and want to read more (I really must get around to the run of the series Greg Rucka wrote) but she's never been a personal favorite, and in fact I like this movie version of her quite a bit better.  Those who are really into the Elektra mythos from the comics the way I am with Batman or the Hulk or The Spectre or certain others may be disappointed by the differences.<br /><br />I knew next to nothing of the plot of this going into this and liked it this way, as almost everything was unexpected that way.  People have complained that it was a slow starter; I prefer that it took the time to build itself up.  I'm going to opt not to say too much about the storyline - the box description is deliberately vague and I think it was intentional that people not know where this was going to take them when they watch it (too many movies today, including some of the greatest, give away far too much in their previews) although that may have cost it at the box office.  Personally, I'm inclined to wonder if it's part of a trend where action movies with female protagonists aren't taken seriously.  Not many seem to do the same mega-business as the big budget action movies with bigname male stars.  It doesn't seem to be like that with other fields of movies - horror, comedy, drama, etc. - but action with a female on the marquee seems to be a bit of a hard sell lately.  I thought it was a very good change of pace to have the female be the central figure this time around, instead of the backup.  If I, for one, was in death-defying danger, personally I think Jennifer Garner in tight red leather would be a fine individual to come to the rescue.<br /><br />But as for who rescues who and who endangers who and what the sides are, not everything's immediately clear in this one.  There are some unexpected turns, and some great characters to take the those turns.  Speaking of characters, some of them I did recognize from the books, others I'm not sure if they were created for the movie or not.  Either way, there are some compelling players in this show.<br /><br />I loved this, hope it does enough on DVD to warrant a sequel, and whole-heartily recommend it.  As noted, it's not the most true-to-the-book adaptations of late, but it's one of the best, and that's saying quite a lot considering the bumper crop of comic-derived movies over the last few years.  Excellent.</p></br><a href="../users/A24KZBAAUTC83R.html">A24KZBAAUTC83R</a><br/><p>I liked this movie. Being a 43-year-old male, looking at Jennifer Garner in red leather was a treat.<br /><br />But also, I thought she lent a solid, mysterious presense to the film. Rob Bowman directs another electrifying action movie. But like Reign of Fire, though cool and neat with solid special effects and actors, it comes somewhat short in some ways.<br /><br />But at least I wasn't bored. The look of the movie is very uncomicbook-like in the beautiful woods of British Columbia. I would purchase the DVD. A fun and different approach to a comic book adaptation.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>Elektra' really surprised me with how well the film was made. Jennifer Garner has perfected her role that she has reprised once again since her last film `Daredevil'. I couldn't picture anyone else as this character after watching this movie, she truly is amazing. This has it all action with cool special effects and a good story. From the animals coming off of Tattoo to just the martial arts battles, this really did impress me. Like everyone has said, you shouldn't judge this movie until you see it. It is very underrated and also very good.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>*****This comment may contain a spoilers*****<br /><br />I loved the look of Elektra; the dark, grisly feel is such homage to the comic. I recommend me so much of favorite panels from the comics. I love how the film depicted Elektra and how she was in conflict with herself. I thought their was a lot of depth in Garner's portrayal. She even surprised me. There are exceptional martial arts sequences in "Elektra", including spectacular kali and escrima stick moves. Key scenes include the first conflict at the cabin and the final showdown with the main villain. Overall, nice movie, I just wish they had went to the "R" rating and traded in some of the dopey green fog for blood.</p></br><a href="../users/AS28WVBBZ3G99.html">AS28WVBBZ3G99</a><br/><p>I liked Elektra for its intrigue, action, martial-arts motif, and, yes, the acting. Maybe I'm just soft on Jennifer Garner. She portrays her characters so well and with such a great heart, she elicits sympathy and support. You really, really want her to win every fight. And she does!<br /><br />In comparison with recent comic book films, Elektra is not quite as good as Spidey 2 but much better than Daredevil. I didn't miss Ben Affleck a bit. The film is on par with Xmen 2. In fact, the viewer will recognize very similar handling of both special effects and special "super" powers of the villains: Stone, Typhoid Mary, and Tattoo, courtesy, I suppose, of the same director for both films.<br /><br />Jennifer Garner is a heart-winner. She is beautiful, talented, and winsome. And so sweet. I must admit, playing a cold-blooded assasin like Elektra is a bit of a stretch for her- even her solid acting skills can't cover up that great heart and sweet spirit.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>It's got pretty much everything I'd want in a comic adaptation - some fair fight/action sequences, over-the-top characters and effects, and Jennifer Garner's babe appeal. It's all safe stuff. The "action violence" is quite bloodless, since vanquished bad guys vanish in a puff of smoke instead of bleeding all over the place. Garner's "Elektra" costume does good things for her figure and for 14-year-old boys, but still covers better than what you see at the beach.<br /><br />The plot moves along well. Elektra is hired to kill a man and his teen daughter. After meeting them, she decides not to finish the contract but to save them instead. Then the chase is on - and it turns out that Daddy and daughter are a bit more than Elektra signed up for. The whole assassination contract was a bit more than she signed up for, but you'll have to see that for yourself.<br /><br />The bad guys are OK, but sometimes uninspired. Typhoid, for example, has the super-power of fatally bad breath. Tattoo has (you guessed it) tattoos - but his tend to wander away. Then there's a guy whose evil super power seems to be in being big. Not super big, just big. Also, there's a lot of detail, but not all of it seems to serve the plot. The OCD thing - how does that explain anything we need to know? The flashbacks were generally good, but a few failed to move the plot forward.<br /><br />It's a good comic book movie, no matter what the critics said. If there had been fewer stray strands and bit stronger action, it might have been great. Still, it was good.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>I saw this at the theater and just watched it on DVD.  Very good movie, I am a fan of Jen Garner, she really worked hard to do this movie, and her fight scenes were incredible.  Recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>There is more emotion and drama in this film than one would expect from the type of movie this is represented to be. I can see why those who are dedicated to unstopping carnage would find this one too introspective and reflective on the emotions and much too short on action. At the beginning the viewer is advised of the ongoing battle between the forces of good and evil and then the movie proceeds to explore its manifestation in the lives of a small group of people on both sides of the conflict.<br /><br />There are a lot of flashbacks that show the circumstances surrounding the development of Elektra's personality and priorities and show the internal battles she is waging between anger and love. The horrible circumstances surrounding her discovery of her mother's body when she was a child continues to haunt her and serve as a catalyst for her anger. The movie is primarily about Elektra's development as a fighter for good as she discovers her true nature is more inclined toward good than toward evil. In the course of this discovery she places herself in great danger protecting two people who will have more significance in her life than she ever expects.<br /><br />If one can accept the required assumptions the movie can be entertaining. It is something of a departure from the norm but may be acceptable to some. I rate it not too bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>This movie was good. Jennifer Garner is one of the reasons why this movie is good. She does a great job of presenting a cold, darker version of Elektra . Her performance to me was not flawed in any manner. In fact the cast overall was decent. The story was very oringinal, and did keep my attention.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Marvel's super hero's.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>The beautiful Jennifer Garner is back as Elektra! After being reborn from DareDevil, Elektra assassinates the bad guys. During Christmas time, Elektra moves to a cottage and meets Mark Miller and his 13-year old girl, Abby. She find out that her next mission is to assassinate them both. After having Christmas dinner, she doesn't want to and all three of them are being hunted down by an organization known as The Hand. There are a lot of special effects and action sequences. If you love action, and sexy Jennifer Garner, you'll love ELEKTRA!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>Before watching this movie I did not know much about this character from the Marvel comics. Elektra died in "Daredevil", but she was brought back from the dead by the Masters. The problem is that now both sides, good and evil, seek her out. She is currently working as a gun-for-hire and is asked to go to an island and wait for instructions regarding her next mission. While she is waiting, she meets a father and daughter living in isolation and trying home-schooling. As soon as Elektra starts to get close to this people, she finds out that they are her target!<br /><br />Compared to "Daredevil", I would say that "Elektra" walks more into the fantastic side, with elements of future seeing, the use of animals to see distant events and other supernatural powers. In this sense, it is more in line with other Marvel comics, like X-Men. The action scenes are not at the level  of "Daredevil" though, which is a shame, since Jennifer Garner is the perfect choice for this type of scenes.<br /><br />Elektra has flashbacks from her childhood and we also get to see some of the events that developed between the time she was brought back from the dead and the current moment. This gives us some information that is helpful for understanding this character, but the development stops there. I would say that overall the film is OK, and allows us to spend some time entertained; but that is all there is to this production. If you are a fan of Marvel, then you definitely have to see it, but for the rest of you I would say do not bother.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F2JUHM6C9RZ9.html">A3F2JUHM6C9RZ9</a><br/><p>Frank Miller's legendary heroine explodes onto the screen with spectacular action and a surprising pathos.  Sexy Jennifer Garner impresses as the martial artist with a vengeful chip on her shoulder, and Terence Stamp proves once again that he's simply one of the finest character actors working today.  Forget FANTASTIC 4 -- ELEKTRA is the must-see comic book movie of the year!</p></br><a href="../users/A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ.html">A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ</a><br/><p>O.K....so the movie starts off pretty good, but about 30-40 minutes into it, Elektra takes a wrong turn and becomes some sort of teenage girl super hero fantasy.<br /><br />Elektra (Jennifer Garner) was killed in the movie "Daredevil", but apparently was brought back to life by some kind of Zen master using a mystical force called "Kimagure", which allows her to see in the future for a limited amount of time. She works as an assassin, going from one mission to another.<br /><br />She is sent to a lake house to kill father/daughter Mark (Goran Visnjic) and Abby (Kirsten Prout) Miller. Not knowing they are her victims at first, the young Abby begins to bond with Elektra. After a Christmas dinner against her will with both father and daughter, Elektra begins to come out of her shell. She learns that Mark is a widower, and that his wife was previously killed by a drunk driver. Of course she relates to Abby, after losing her mother at an early age also.<br /><br />Afterwards, Elektra finds out that Mark and Abby are her next assignment, and that a group of highly skilled and mystical vigilantes called "The Order of the Hand" are the ones who put the hit on the Millers. Elektra tries to kill the Millers, but alas, she just can't seem to do it.<br /><br />So she does the next best thing: she joins forces with them and decides to fight against the "Hand", whose members all have special abilities of there own (which for the most part are pretty cool)<br /><br />Along the way "Elektra" realizes that the Millers' aren't exactly who they claim to be. This reviewer won't disclose who the Millers' are but will say that once they are revealed, that is when the movie "Elektra" really becomes some sort of Spy Kids/Wonder Woman/Wonder Girl kind of soap opera.<br /><br />All in all Elektra isn't a horrible movie; it's just not a great one either. It suffers from some pretty long stretches throughout. It also fluctuates on being a film made for adults and then for kids; but never really finds it's footing with either audience. Essentially, the film ends up feeling as though it was made for teenage girls.<br /><br />Having never read the Elektra comic book character, I am not sure how closely the comic interpretation of Elektra matches the film. The one thing I am positive of is that Jennifer Garner looks better than ever in the red costume she wears, and she can definitely hold a film together; especially when there's not much of anything else to grab on to.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>Elektra was darn near perfect and definitly better than DareDevil but not every one of Marvels releases can be perfect now can they. Right about towards the end of this movie you start feeling like did I miss a scene because I just went to the bathroom for a second and boom elektra's fighting the last battle to save the treasure, for example in the beginning elektra is very tense and unable to show any type of emotion and then about 15 maybe  20 minutes into the movie without showing any interest or feelings she's kissing Goran Visnjic. I really think that elektra was put together a bit sloppy because it seems like the cast was willing to give everything they had and the crew just wanted to get everything done before lunch. The acting in this movie wasn't great it was like they were shooting elektra the tv series episode 15 not the movie and it seemed rushed. I gave elektra 4 stars because besides the ok acting and the rushed scenes the fight scenes and camera work was amazing if it diddn't have that this movie hits a rock above rock bottom.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>This movie wasn't bad, though I didn't feel the need afterward to kick myself for skipping it in theaters and waiting for the DVD.  I'll say one thing, "Elektra" is a busy little movie.  While entertaining you with the immediate (and fast-paced) story at hand, it also finds time to explain and update us on many aspects of Elektra's past, including how she acquired all those amazing fighting skills she displayed in "Daredevil", how she came back from the dead after the end of said film, how and why she eventually had a falling out with her life-saving benefactors and became the assassin for hire she is at the beginning of this film, etc., etc.  So, the movie does all that AND relates her big battle with the evil, mystical group known only as The Hand (the movie's main story), thus paving the road to her redemption.  And it does all this in a shade over 90 minutes.  Whew!<br /><br />A longer, more epic-like movie- with a little more breathing space- might have been better, but who knows for sure?  It's important to remember, after all, that many comics fans weren't all that keen on Elektra's return from the dead in the comics, either (after her memorable death in Daredevil #181), and that some comics readers enjoyed her post-resurrection stories and some didn't.  So it feels kind of appropriate that the movie also generates ambivelent feelings along the lines of "yeah, it's a good enough movie, but did they really need to bring her back from the dead?"<br /><br />The often-talked-about ("it's in the movie... no, wait, they changed their mind and took it out!") cameo appearance by Ben Affleck's Matt Murdock / Daredevil character is finally available for your viewing pleasure in the deleted scenes section, and it's very brief.  Essentially it's Elektra seeing Matt in a dream where he says "Come back to me" and she replies "When I'm ready."  That it's, fifteen seconds tops.  It was so brief that it was silly that they cut it.  It would have provided a nice bit of continuity while also demonstrating that Elektra hadn't completely forgotten or blown off her previous experiences with Matt Murdock.  Oh, well... at least the moment can been seen in some fashion now.<br /><br />The amount of DVD extras are pretty much just right for an entertaining but ultimately- let's be honest- marginal film like this one... you get a few deleted scenes, a couple of featurettes, and a commentary (which I haven't checked out yet).  This may sound like a weird complaint, but I think that too often DVDs give you way too much in the "extras" department, more than most films actually warrant.  To me, that's almost as bad as DVD's that give you little or no extras.  The extras offered here, which are interesting and to the point, feel just right.<br /><br />So, in the end, if you keep your expectations in check, I think you'll generally enjoy watching Jennifer Garner take on a variety of colorful villains for an hour and a half.  So go ahead, give this a whirl.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>It can't be pretended that "Elektra" is anything but a cash-in on "Daredevil" and star Jennifer Garner's popularity as an action star. And the spinoff film as as soulless as that would suggest -- it has some pretty special effects, but is brought down by a half-hearted script that aspires to be a mix of Chinese wire-fu and "Kill Bill."<br /><br />Elektra (Jennifer Garner) died at the end of "Daredevil." But in the comic book world, death is less restricting than a sprained knee: Elektra is resurrected by the magical mystical powers of Terence Stamp (okay, his character is ungracefully called Stick). She is now a contract killer, and is sent to off a father and daughter in some remote place.<br /><br />It turns out that there is a Chosen One (hello, fantasy cliches!) who will be a pivot in the battle between good and evil. And the girl Abby (Kirsten Prout) is that Chosen One. Beset by childhood traumas, Elektra decides to protect the two of them from the Hand, a magical bunch of Japanese evildoers who have decided to kill Abby.<br /><br />When a movie is a cash-in spinoff of a cinematic disaster like "Daredevil," you can't expect it to be good. Especially if the lead heroine -- as in the howlingly bad "Catwoman" -- wears silly leather bondage gear and utters moronic quips. Can't there be a heroine who wears something that would stay on during kung-fu ation scenes?<br /><br />Rob Bowman better stick to sci-fi suspense, because he can't do action. It feels as if he wanted to make a cross between "Kill Bill" and "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon," with a bit of "Zatoichi" (the blind master) thrown in. The script teems with cliches -- the tortured tough gal! The sensitive love interest! The precocious, poorly-acted kiddie! The wise Yoda clone! Throw in a few high-kicks and you have "Elektra."<br /><br />It's impossible to really gauge Garner's acting, because the character is as deep as a hamster's footbath -- okay, her mum died when she was little. Very sad, but it doesn't give her character depth, and Elektra Natchios shows no real personality except a few strained quips. Her love interest barely registers, and the villains are just there to do special effects and inconsistent stunts. (One minute you can stab them, the next they're invincible. Huh?)<br /><br />"Elektra" is a heartless, dull mess of flips and quips -- and that's just the character. The movie is even worse, second only to "Catwoman" for comic book badness.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Ah yes, super heroes, those eccentric, maladjusted, social pariahs, forever troubled by their pasts.  Ben Affleck was effectively blind and dysfunctional as Daredevil; Christian Bale much less appealing (in my humble opine) as a wimpy Batman.  But when it comes to a super hero who can simultaneously kick arse and hold a guilt-ridden pity party, no one can hold a candle to sleek bombshell Jennifer Garner; not only that, she wears a red outfit that makes Viagra a mere breath mint, and she moves and grooves in ways that make ELEKTRA serve its very own call of the wild.<br /><br />The plot is campy and goofy, but name me a super hero plot that isn't.  Garner's Elektra is a professional assasin (what a way to go), only she's taken a gig she can't complete; meanwhile, she's pitted against some supernatural ninja-types (talk to the Hand) who share a commonality with her high-drama past.  She fights, she pouts, she swims to relieve her guilt, then--like all action heroes--she comes back from near-death to become an invincible villain mauler.<br /><br />Garner makes this film so much fun to watch; she's beautiful, graceful, exotic, and deadly, and I want to take my next vacation in her dimple.  Heck, in that outfit she could just stand in front of a camera and read the phone book; I would not be entertained any less.  Jennifer, sweetheart, you are my alltime favorite super hero as ELEKTRA.  And you've got the costume to prove it.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, Walk-On</p></br></body></html>

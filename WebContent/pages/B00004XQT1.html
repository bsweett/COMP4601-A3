Christian Bale drew me in when I first saw this movie. Every movie he is in, he always seems to be on top of his game. Sure some of his movie havent been all too great, yet he still puts on a hell of a show. I love the book as well, which is more explict then this. Its a great move.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>I confess I didn't care about this seemingly pretentious movie the first time I saw it. But it  is a daring movie, and its sordid potrayal of a whacko's life is certainly not recommended for the faint of heart. If you look beyond the gore (which is perhaps incidental to the plot) it's actually quite a piquant satirical take on a superficial, greed orientated society. <p>The violence here is not gratuitous, at least to me it did not seem to be a convenient vehicle to make a voyeuristic film and shock audiences.  It surely is not a movie that investigates the innards of a psychotic killer's mind as some reviewers lament. <p>Ostentatiously, the plot is about an eccentric Wall Street yuppie Patrick Bateman (played brilliantly by Christian Bale) whose life revolves around the superficial trappings of materialism -- parties at swank bars, 1500 dollar Valentino suits, threesomes with professional women etc etc.  At first you are struck with the utter weirdness of this guy's mannerisms, no one would associate with this wacko in real life.  Bateman's attempts to out-do his peers and be noticed and accepted get more and more pathologically brutal and heinous as the story progresses. But, despite his insanity, he's desperate to be caught. The confession at the end which draws total dismissal from his peers, just reiterates the kind of society we're in. <p>We have a smattering of super-sardonic moments, the crescendo reached when we witness a business card comparison match between corporate peers. Or hotel reservations, the ultimate badge of Who's Who. <p>The film has very subtle undertones if you are willing to read between the lines. For a genre that is too often too campy, too violent without cause, and too brainless, American Psycho is a breath of fresh air. It appears campy at first. It is violent, especially towards women. But it is not brainless. I'd say it is even well written. <p>Take the time to actually watch this movie and think about it. You'll see there's much more than meets the eye.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>what a wild in your face dark comedy about the excess of the 80's lifestyle.  Bale is excellent at depicting a character who has become so shallow and empty that he rebels in his American Psycho way.  Scenes like Bateman in the shower and his morning prep routine and the business card comparisons are hysterical in the way the point out some of the absurdities and foolishness of this era.  Bale is so slick and so wired in his extremes in behaviour and his voice over dialogues are performed to perfection. It is so subversively witty - that the social aspects of this time come across as almost more scary than the violence.  Were we that bad?  Other performances are great here too: dafoe, mathis, leto, and Chloe Sevigny who is the only one who can actually steal her scenes away from Bale.  I used to work with a bunch of Patrick Batemans who had too much too early and too easy - I wonder what happened to them.</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>The film changes plenty of Bret Easton Ellis's wonderful novel, but thankfully it retains the all-important ambiguity: does Patrick Bateman really engage in acts of unspeakable brutality, or are these merely the fantasies of a mind increasingly unhinged by the excesses of high-rent American hedonism?  A brave Christian Bale is unforgettable as the tragi-comic Bateman, and will have you thanking the fatally cautious Leonardo DiCaprio for passing on the role.  Writer/director Mary Harron perfectly captures the ambience of the novel, and the design by Gideon Ponte and Andrew M. Stearn goes a long way to making low-budget look high class.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>American Psycho is the long delayed film version of the novel by Bret Easton Ellis. When it was published nearly ten years ago, it was met with a storm of controversy. Its quite graphic violence caused critics to overlook the book's central theme, which is that a society awash in materialism will lose its collective soul. As the main character puts it, "The only true emotions I feel are disgust and greed." Originally, Oliver Stone wanted to film it using Leonardo DiCaprio as the protagonist, Patrick Bateman. I can see Leo D. in the part, but I imagine Stone would have made a very violent and very loud mess of it. Finally, the project was placed in the hands of director Mary Harron, and she wisely chose to emphasis the book's satirical and comedic elements over its violence. The result is a movie that is about as good a filming of the novel as one could hope for. Whether or not it is also entertainment depends on each viewer's tastes. <p>Christian Bale gives the performance of his life as Patrick Bateman. Patrick is a young man who is the epitome of a soulless success. Wickedly bright and utterly ruthless, he makes big bucks working at a high powered finanical concern in New York. He works out religiously. He is fanatical about his appearance, and his morning routine of getting himself cleaned up, made up and dressed for work would put any movie star to shame. His wardrobe is impeccable. His haircut is perfect. Even his business cards are designed to be the best. Any coworker who dresses better or looks better than Patrick is considered to be competition and, thus, one of the enemy. His carefully contrived personal appearance goes far beyond the masks we knew in the past. It is more of a tool than his words or his actions. It is also a trap and a weapon. Yet most of the people Patrick knows seem to be using the same weapon, while Patrick is the only one who knows that behind the facade there is usually only emptiness. In this pursuit of meaningless physical and material perfection, he has also gone stark raving mad. He finally snaps. One evening he takes Paul Allen [Jared Leto], his fiercest competitor, out to dinner and then to his apartment, where he coldly and calculatedly kills him with an ax. When the police question him about the missing Allen, he coolly throws them off the track. At the same time, as his madness takes complete control, he goes on a murderous rampage. <p>American Psycho is not a slasher flick nor is a thriller. It is a satirical black comedy that makes a valid attempt to show the ultimate futility of a relatively small but influential segment of American society. It does not always succeed, especially towards the end, because the violence ultimately becomes too numbing. This fact does not prevent it from being one of 2000's more original movies, and it does nothing to overshadow the enormous talents of its star and its director.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>Now that I am over the shock of this films ending, I guess that I will write my review.<p>This film was one of the most complicated films that I have ever seen. The whole thing was just bizarre. It was totally and utterly violent and disturbing. On the other hand, certain scenes were hilarious. Christian Bale gives a great portrayal of Patrick Bateman, a self absorbed nut who ticks off about the littlest things. He targets women when he gets really angry about things, and sometimes takes his anger on certain gentleman in his office. When things don't go his way or situations get too stressful for him, something inside him sparks, and he has to kill. Meanwhile, his relationship with his ditzy girlfriend is on the rocks, and her airhead friends constantly surround him. Life sucks for this doofus.<p>The other performances were equally effective. Reese Witherspoon plays Patrick's girlfriend, and she is perfect for the role. The musical score has hints of Bernard Herrmann's &quot;Psycho&quot; score, which fits in this film perfectly.<p>However, this film is very graphic and unnerving, and I don't know if I would recommend it or not; also, the ending was... well...never mind. <p>This one is definitely not for kids.</p></br><a href="../users/A18CRS4FLVH5YW.html">A18CRS4FLVH5YW</a><br/><p>I was quite impressed with this film.  Namely with the fact Christian Bale conveys such a visciousness that if you were ever to encounter him in person you would never look at rich, wealthy, yuppie types the same way  again.  The thing that makes this film so much fun to watch is the fusion  of 80's nostalgia and raw carnage being displayed with such creativity.  I  imagine the forthcoming DVD will have deleted scenes that weren't used in  the initial film making the experience even more surreal.  What is so  impressive is how the director makes the mood so pasty and drab looking.  Every scene has this dark sensibility but most of the time you are  presented with daytime overcast skies, white walls and classic 80's  artwork. The sets make Batemans character seem so friendly but so  incredibly frightening too.  You leave the film thinking about all the  people you know in your life that could possibly have similar defects.  This film is definately a winner and sure to be the Christian Bale breakout  performance people will remember him for.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>While I believe that the book is masterfully written, I kept asking myself when I was reading it whether Ellis had a deal with the Devil - who dictated to him the confessions of the worst serial killer ever.<br /><br />It is a brilliant description of the 80s - you can hear them, see them, almost touch them, they practically scream at you from the pages; and dark portrait of the 80-th golden boy who went on the rampage.<br /><br />I did not think that there were one woman in the world who would enjoy that book; To admire it, to respect it - yes but to enjoy it...<br /><br />Well, there was one woman, Mary Harron, who liked and respected AP so much that she decided to transform it to the screen - and it worked. She cut down on the gore and sex and concentrated on the satire. I liked the film when I saw it first time; I love it now after the second viewing. Surprisingly restrained and funny - it has one of the best scenes I've seen in the films lately - the war of credit cards.<br /><br />The show belongs to Christian Bale - and he delivers as Patrick Bateman, the rich and beautiful 26 year old Wall Street banker with the secrets so dark that he makes Dr. Lector look like a Sesame Street character. Bale's cold, charismatic, misogynist turn is riveting. His James Bondian-esque face changes to the devilish mask with the reptilian eyes so rapidly, that your blood would freeze.</p></br><a href="../users/A228JH8V9Y700G.html">A228JH8V9Y700G</a><br/><p>There has been a great debate over this movie's being classified as horror or comedy.  It is grusome, horrible and gory, but at the same time oddly cute at times.  It portrays a period in time and a certain mentality, but at the same time transcends to present day.<br /><br />Patrick Bateman is the yuppie scum we grew to hate: arrogant, materialistic, and self serving.  Yet, at the same time while being psychotic, he longs for substance.  He seeks it out in friends, job and social life, and finds nothing.  Instead he becomes obsessed with the most trivial of insignifigant things (ex. designer clothes), going so far as to obsess over the subtle watermarks on a business card.  His friends and aquaintance are so shallow they confuse him with someone else and he's happy to play into it.  Why shouldn't he?  No one knows the difference or takes the time out to realize it.  Maybe this is more a comment on our culture despite the yuppie / 80s backdrop.  People really are not all that concerned with more than themselves.  Perhaps none of us have true friends, it's all an illusion.  I believe that, I believe a lot of that to be true.<br /><br />One of the oddest things I found about this movie was Patrick's relationship with his girlfriend.  While she is just as shallow and rude as the others, she has an odd hold over him that no one else seems to.  He doesn't exactly follow her orders, but she seems to have almost a mothering effect on him.  Patrick seems almost afraid of her, and when he finally ends the relationship he almost apologizes when he takes joy in hurting others.<br /><br />Many people were angry about the sex scenes.  If anything they were just ridiculous (how about that scene of him flexing and posturing before the mirror with those two hookers while playing Phil Collins songs?!).  Want a real horror story, read the book.  It's disturbing, but then again that's the point of the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>Hey! I haven't seen you in here before, but I *have* seen you, right---didn't we meet at Dorsia? Yeah, I know it's tough to get reservations there, but trust me---I can get them anytime. I'm connected with the Maitre D'. Dinner, say Friday, say eight? Where do you work out, anyway?<br /><br />Since we're talking Movers and Shakers, let me introduce you to my homeskillet Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale, who completely owns the film)---he's the go-to guy in Mergers & Acquisitions at Pierce & Pierce, Wall Street investment banking hotshot, hooking up with Upper East Side fashion maven and society diva Evelyn Williams (Reese Witherspoon, compulsively consuming)---the lucky dog!---and frankly, between the two of us, the guy you want to talk to to cuff your links, tie your knots, and give you the low-down on the best shoes to accent your Hugo Boss or Armani. PC before PC was cool. Big on the enviroment, nuclear freeze, health care, education, helping out the poor and downtrodden, stamping out genocide in Sri Lanka. Boy Next Door.<br /><br />Monster and Serial Killer.<br /><br />Yep, Patrick is big on buying industrial nail guns, stapling witless prostitutes to the floor, touching them up with a little acid facial, topping that off with some mace, and storing their heads in his Sub-Zero high-end refrigerator/freezer unit. He wants to fit in, our Patrick, but you know, a man's got to have hobbies. Norman Bates said it perfectly when he noted "we all go a little crazy sometimes".<br /><br />OK, granted, bad example. But Jesus, a man's got to---you know---*vent* sometimes.<br /><br />When I heard they were making Bret Easton Ellis's study in psychosis and carnal yuppiedom "American Pyscho" into a movie, I thought it couldn't be done. Then I heard Mary Harron was helming it, and I sighed with bliss: Harron's "I Shot Andy Warhol" was a kind of cinematic kindred spirit to American Psycho, both delving into the mental states of complete gibbering lunatics no one took seriously.<br /><br />I see you're staring at my shoes---they're Allen-Edmonds wingtips (USD 795). Oh, you're not? Where was I? Is that Donald Trump?<br /><br />Anyway, the flick chronicles our man Bateman---a practical GQ fashion & hygiene expert, I might add!---in his days as Wall Street guru, his nights as impromptu surgeon. He's a great authority on Huey Lewis & the News, which you can hear on his state-of-the-art B&O surround sound system (USD 25,000), accompanied by Bateman's ever-astute commentary---that is, if you can hear it over the screams.<br /><br />He exults in six-pack abs. He keeps his skin nice and taut and rosy with all sorts of unguents and admixtures. He has a great tan, compliments of his little tanning sarcophagus. He hits the club scene and comes home with dinner, dinner that talks and thinks and hopes. He keeps those abs bristling with daily workouts, accompanied to porn tapes and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. He'd better damn sure have a better business card than you.<br /><br />Harron takes liberties with Ellis's material, but captures the essentials like a champ. This isn't a gory flick---not by a longshot, given that the literary Bateman liked introducing a starving wharf rat into the nether regions of his victims---but it gets the point across.<br /><br />Bateman tearing through a high end West Side penthouse with a chainsaw (my God, the boy has good aim!). Bateman administering the coup de grace to a bum, then stomping the bum's cowering doggy to death. Bateman feeding a kitten to the friendly neighborhood ATM (it says FEED ME A KITTEN---honestly, could you resist? Not I!). Bateman despairing at being outdone by his wretched rival Paul Allen (the incomparable Jared Leto, smirking and smarmy to the exceptionally bitter end).<br /><br />From what's for dinner on the menu at New York's high end eateries (might I recommend the Dauphin Gratinois with the Lobster frappe?), to the existential agonies of getting a good table at Dorsia, to the shame of living in even a good Upper West Side apartment (with doorman), Harron nails the raw bloody guts of the No-Exit damnation lurking at the black, fetid, festering, maggot-ridden heart of High Society---or any society, for that matter. Cinematographer Andrzej Sekula gives Harron full air support---and he should, since he did the camera-work for Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Four Rooms. Stuff looks good here.<br /><br />Bale put me off on my first viewing---his campy smile, his goofy voice, his off-kilter mannerisms---but he's perfect. Bateman isn't in control, after all: he thinks his mask is slipping, when it's already on the floor and shunting down the drain.<br /><br />Frankly, all the acting is first-rate: Samantha Mathis Xanax'd to perfection as Bateman's mistress and free-range society delectation Courtney, Matt Ross as the hideous Luis Carruthers, Justin Theroux owning yet another bit part as Bryce, Josh Lucas note-perfect as McDermott, Chloe Sevigny is at her cringing, cloying best---my god, it's hard not to adore her---and Willem Dafoe as the police detective, looming like a stormcloud about to break that never really does, and proving---with his face alone---that Sam Raimi was off his rocker to even *think* about putting Dafoe in a mask as the Green Goblin. Fool.<br /><br />Some call this satire. Ignore them. This is pure, unadulterated horror; Pat Bateman's midnight outtings are consequence and causality of our wearing one too many masks to placate society: the Beast must get out! It must eat!<br /><br />Why are you staring at my tie (Forzieri, USD 275.00)? Nah, that's not blood---it's spaghetti sauce from lunch, silly. Anyway, I gotta hop---time is money, and I've got to return some videotapes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>Who is Patrick Bateman?<br /><br />A valid question for those reading this review.  One must wonder if he is the socially elite of the New York business world, the prime example of an obsessive compulsive, or the face of evil itself with an endless expense account and an unquenched need to kill - kill - and kill again.  Just like the illusive Tootsie-Roll Pop, the world may never know.  Bret Easton Ellis penned him, director Mary Harron gave him the paved road, while Christian Bale gave us the face, the mannerisms, and the world of the unknown Bateman.  For those unfamiliar, Bateman is a new sort of serial killer.  Not quite the BTK or Bundy, but the terror certainly ranges from within.  Living in a posh apartment, eating at the fanciest of restaurants, and enjoying all the pleasures of 1980s New York, Bateman struggles with himself and the need to kill time and time again.  His victims, mostly prostitutes and business cohorts, suffer the worst (far worse in the book) punishments alive either from ax, nail gun, hanger, or the ever popular chainsaw.  Pulling from pop culture, dark obsessions, and eerily our own desires, Bateman shows no conscious, no compassion, no rational thought for these crimes, he just kills and kills and kills.<br /><br />Where this film takes a different element than you a-typical slasher film or horror genre is that midway through you begin to question the sanity of our anti-hero.  Events transpire that catch both Bateman as well as the viewers off-guard.  The biggest question is Paul Allen.  The phenomenally understated Jared Leto delivers a mirror performance to Bale's as another suit in the business world.  Due to accounts and business cards, Bateman dissolves the friendship - yet, everyone continues to see Allen walking the streets and having lunch with him.  Even the detective hired for the case, one Donald Kimball (played by Willem Dafoe) seems to prove otherwise.  Yet, something nags at our belief.  This is only confirmed with an ending that will make you stop, rewind, and watch again.  Questing everything from the mouth of Bateman, as well as his surroundings.  Slasher film?  Um, this reviewer would rather place it into the genre of self-discovery.  There was a film entitled "What the Bleep Do We Know" that attempts to understand the meaning of life, but for me, "American Psycho" can do it like no other.<br /><br />For anyone looking for that film that contains an amazing score, an ensemble of known actors giving us performances of a lifetime, and direction that both mimics and mocks the lifestyle in New York during the 80s - than "American Psycho" is the film for you.  For me, I don't understand why it isn't further a staple of the film community.  Christian Bale could not have been a better choice for the face of Bateman, his ability to transform himself into the character was outstanding.  His character wasn't over the top, nor was it Bale being a character - he was Patrick Bateman.  What is it with Bale - there hasn't been one underscored performance yet.  "Batman Begins", "The Prestige", "Velvet Goldmine", and the "Machinist" are all within my top films of all time.  "American Psycho" ranks above them all.  Scenes, for me, that stand out are (2) major ones.  The first, which proves that Mary Harron was the perfect choice to direct and that her decision to cast Jared Leto was directly on target is the scene with Leto and Bale as he prepares the ax and explains the lyrical juxtaposition of Huey Lewis.  The language, the motions, and the choreography of the scene remains in my eyes, one of the strongest in cinema history.  The second scene, while less cinematically inclined, is that of Bale running naked through the halls of his apartment, dawning only his tennis shoes (naked to the bone), with chain a-blazin' as he chases one of the escaping prostitutes.  Again, maybe not the best in history, but a scene that constantly makes me laugh, shiver in terror, and remain in awe of the skill  known as Christian Bale.<br /><br />I would go so far as to say that this is a flawless film.  As I watch this film for the dozenth time, I cannot find errors in the filmmaking.  Perhaps there errors with continuity, but I don't pay attention.  I look at the overall value of the film, and this is a cult film, hands down.  I must admit, the only issue that I have trouble with is the ever lacking bonus features on this disc.  I have the original version released and it only has a handful of extras which are not anything to overly write about, but what ergs me is the ever lacking audio commentary that would have been great to hear about this story.  Perhaps it would have included a bit more about the ending, less fog surrounding it, but not to worry - there is a newer version, the "Uncut Killer's Collector's Edition" that should remedy all of these missing elements.<br /><br />Overall, "American Psycho" ranks among one of my favorite films of all time.  While my list constantly grows, this remain a constant.  I cannot speak any higher of Bale, or of Harron's direction which continues to impress me during each viewing.  The music is what stood out in my eyes.  There is a scene where someone laughs half-heartedly at a comment made by Bateman about liking Whitney Houston.  I loved his interpretation of a Phil Collins song.  It was these small elements that all came together perfectly for this film.  "American Psycho" is a look within the business soul.  As I watched this film, I thought of it as an extension to the "Wall Street" arm, could  Gordon Gekko be Patrick's father?  The insanity of New York, the pressures of working in a constantly obliterating corporate world, the standards of humanity - all blend together just far enough to make you question the existence of the man sitting next to you.  For anyone who has ever worked for Corporate America - this is the film for you.<br /><br />Now, I gotta go return some videos.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Mary Harron<br /><br />Cast:  Christian Bale, Justin Theroux, John Lucas, Bill Sage, Chloe Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, Samantha Mathis, Matt Ross, Jared Leto, Willem Dafoe.<br /><br />Running Time:  101 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for strong violence, sexuality, drug use and language.<br /><br />"American Psycho" is a disturbing movie filled with the brutal murders and executions of various people (mostly of the female persuasion). What's really scary is that through much of the movie, our funny bone is being tickled. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale, in a star-making turn) is a shallow Wall Street banker who lives an empty life. He lives and dies by a soda pop advertising slogan: Image Is Everything.  Set in the late 1980s, he is of a time when style reigns supreme over substance, obsessed with his physical beauty, getting into the trendiest restaurants, and nitpicking with his coworkers about who has the best business cards. Said co-workers (Jared Leto, Matt Ross, Justin Theroux, and Josh Lucas), all have the same haircut and business suits, and for all intents and purposes are interchangeable. Bateman's sex life isn't exactly lacking, by any means. He's engaged to the shallow Evelyn Williams (Reese Witherspoon), but cheats on her with her best friend Courtney (Samantha Mathis). He picks up a hooker off the street (Cara Seymour) and gets her in a threesome with another one of his friends, Elizabeth (Guinevere Turner, who co wrote the script).  His secretary Jean (Chloe Sevigny) also secretly lusts after him. Little does she know that he seems to have knocked off his best friend Paul Allen (Leto), a nameless homeless man, and countless members of the fairer sex, all by increasingly imaginative killing methods (staple gun, chainsaw, ATM machine; he tries it all). Eventually he finds he's being trailed by detective Kimball (Willem Dafoe), who's investing Allen's disappearance but also seems to know a bit more about Patrick than he should.  From this moment on Bateman's inner demons are unleashed as he descends into an unending frenzy of paranoia and murder.<br /><br />Directed by Mary Harron ("I Shot Andy Warhol", "The Notorious Betty Page") made a clever social satire film mixed brilliantly with horror. This film is loaded with dark humor, while Bale gives a dynamic performance. This independent film has high production values, a fine music score by John Cale and good looking cinematography by Andrzej Sekula ("Pulp Fiction").  The film adaptation shows the depths of the novel refraining from its cruelty. Even though it boasts some shocking scenes (i.e. the chainsaw) the nature of the impact is mainly psychological and relies very much on the impressive performance by Christian Bale, once again proving the wonderful actor he is. Rather than being dark and ambiguous with respect to the main character, Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner have chosen to look at him from outside thus exposing his pantheism and twisted sense of reality, therefore avoiding any chance of glamorization of the character, and the film is constantly mocking his yuppie macho conceit, something the novel left the reader to do him/herself. Also, it deserves to be noted that the film is much more woman-friendly than the novel could possibly ever be, most female characters (including the melancholy Courtney) being sympathetic. There is no scope for misogyny here.  American Psycho" is a movie that pushes the limits of the audience's ability to cope for a number of reasons. A film told from the point of view of a psychotic is harsh enough, but the film also beckons the audience to question their own sanity. You're forced to look at your own sensibilities and morals and put them to the test...can you condone Bateman's actions and thoughts? Do you agree with them? Sometimes you find yourself saying yes to these questions, and for this some people may call it a travesty. By the same token, it pushes the envelope, thus it could even be called a triumph. Be warned:  this is not a film for all tastes, but one thing is certain, it is one of a kind.</p></br><a href="../users/A331OF34UX4Y1K.html">A331OF34UX4Y1K</a><br/><p>Well, if the yuppies who are making thousand or millions of dollars are so stupid and so empty of character as the ones portrayed in this movie, uau, they must be geniuses for being so silly and still marking lots of money.... Anyway, Bale's acting is great, the editing is good, direction is good, but the story sucks.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>AMERICAN PSYCHO, 12 years after its release as a film, retains its power as a very dark human comedy. Based on the popular Bret Easton Ellis  novel and adapted for the screen by Guinevere Turner and director Mary Harron it has the effect on the surface of being a brutally disgusting horror story but if the viewer stops there the point of the tale is missed. This is a parody on human behavior pushed to extremes and one of the main reason if works so immensely well is the fine performance by Christian Bale as the title character.<br /><br />Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is an obsessive compulsive, style driven, ego maniacal successful wealthy Wall Street figure, working for this father's company.  The film wisely dwells on the manner in which Patrick starts every day - doing abdominal crunches and weight lifting (the resulting body Bale built is stunning eye candy!), every lotion and potion he puts on his face to keep his youthful appearance, dressing in the most expensive clothes and concentrating on reservations in the most expensive and exclusive restaurants for lunches and dinners with his associates (Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas, Bill Sage).  Critical of even the appearance of the outfits and shoes of his secretary (Chlo? Sevigny) and polished like a gleaming Tiffany diamond, he is as shallow as those around him in the `look at me' 1980s. He is dating a would-be fianc&eacute;e (Reese Witherspoon) but pays little attention to her.  Instead, at night Patrick murders people: he picks up hookers, kills them and mutilates them, hiding them in plastic bags like so much discarded clothing. He also murders street people for no reason and then begins a killing spree that reveals how completely psychotic he is, pretending to be a person he has already killed (Josh Lucas). The only law enforcement person on the scene (Willem Dafoe) but so little that he can be overlooked.<br /><br />AMERICAN PSYCHO is a film that packs a wallop and Christian Bale gives a bravura performance. It is becoming a cult classic and that designator is well deserved.

Good thing they didn't get Leonardo Dicaprio to play Bateman. As much as a good actor Dicaprio is, he doesn't fit into Bateman's shoes.<br /><br />This movie isn't as gory as the book, but the performances by everyone in this film makes this film a killer. Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a New York City yuppy who has money, hangs out with his friends at clubs and dinner, has a sweet girlfriend {Witherspoon}, and has a nice apt. But, there's something about him his friends don't know, he's a murderer.<br /><br />But, things don't go too well after he kills Paul Allen {Leto}, a detective Kimble {Dafoe} is now questioning him on Allen's disappearance.<br /><br />This uncut version doesn't have extra gore, just a longer scene of him having sex with 2 lovely ladies. This DVD does have cool features, but I wish a new interview with Christian Bale was on it. I guess he was too busy filming Batman Begins.<br /><br />American Psycho is a must-have for all fans of the book and film fans all around.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AXHNRDJEQ0B.html">A1AXHNRDJEQ0B</a><br/><p>While I never read the book the movie is based on, I've repeatedly heard the book's hard core fans declare the movie 'not violent enough'. The movie itself shows less graphic violence than 'Fight Club', and I would say the movie's rating has a lot more to do with the sex scenes than the violence.<p>The movie itself is a combination of a few genres. On one hand, there are many elements of a 'slasher flick'- serial killer, bloody killings, etc. There arew also elements of a black comedy, and a 'psychological' element - we do get into Patrick Bateman's psyche, especially towards the end of the movie.<p>But even with all these elements, I felt that most of all, this was a period piece - about the &uacute;pper class Manhatten social group, where getting a good table at the 'best'restaurant becomes an almost life or death issue, and surface and first impressions meant everything. Success was decided based on a person's platinum credit card, his business card, the blondness (and dumness) of his girlfriend, but most of all - on his ability to get a 'res'at the best restaurants.<p>There were very few special features on this DVD, mostly the standard (cast & crew, trailer, behind the scenes featurette, etc.). The interview with Christian Bale was enlightning, but is no substitute for a commentary.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>No doubt about it, Mary Harrion's "American Psycho" is definitely not for every taste and audience demographic.  The good news is, perhaps, that the film is nowhere near as gruesome and gory as both its subject matter and its controversial nature would lead one to believe.  In fact, its tone of ironic comic detachment helps to de-emphasize the more sordid aspects of the material and to instead highlight the film's bitingly satiric message.  <p>Set in the mid-1980's, "American Psycho" casts a scathing eye on the then-brand new, up-and-coming group of 20-something executives known as "yuppies."  Patrick Bateman, the psycho of the title, is a man who literally seems to have everything - stunning good looks, a fantastic physique, a beautiful fianc&eacute;, a diploma from Harvard and a successful career as a Wall Street executive.  Yet, alone of the young men with whom he consorts, Patrick flatly admits to us in voice-over narration that he is literally an empty-suit - that his perfectly maintained outer appearance, seemingly well-ordered social routine and empty, superficial personal relationships merely mask the moral emptiness that lurks at the core of his soul.  Much of the complexity of Patrick's character comes from the fact that he seems, paradoxically, to be both obsessed with the idea of conforming to the values of the world he lives in, and, at the same time, being strangely conscious of their unreality and meaninglessness.  Thus, we see him becoming almost emotionally unglued because he fears he will not be able to reserve the proper table at a posh upscale restaurant or because he feels that one of his corporate buddies has a more impressive looking business card than he does.  Much of Patrick's madness has its roots in the kind of obsessive-compulsive paranoia that arises from the modern insistence that life should and, indeed, can be converted into a perfect, problem-free existence if one just has enough money and a sufficient amount of the right "stuff" to make it that way.  Frankly admitting that he feels no emotional attachment to any other human beings, Patrick is thereby free to channel his madness into its ultimate anti-social, taboo-shattering shape and form: serial killing.  Thus, as days turn to nights, Patrick begins to rack up his victims and potential victims - a homeless man, assorted prostitutes, an ex-girlfriend, an unctuous business associate, even some policemen who get wise to his activities later in the film.  <p>Luckily for the squeamish among us, far more of the film's running time is devoted to a comic rather than thriller mode.  The brittle, dryly humorous Mary Harrion/Guinevere Turner screenplay mines the corporate world milieu and the twisted rantings of a values-free mind for all their black comedy potential.  Christian Bale brings a remarkable subtlety to a touchy role, managing to seem coolly alluring, chillingly detached, touchingly pathetic and wryly amusing all at the same time.  Special credit should go to the stark, almost antiseptic look the filmmakers achieve through the art direction and set design, a look that matches in visual terms the moral and emotional emptiness of the characters and their world.  <p>Much was made of the anti-woman tone of the novel at the time of its initial release. Perhaps because the writers and the director are themselves women, the movie seems to have toned down that aspect quite a bit.  Indeed, as in a movie like "In the Company of Men," we find ourselves not so much appalled as sadly bemused by the vehemently anti-women comments uttered by Patrick and his cronies because we see what shallow losers these men really are.  Harrion and Turner obviously know whereof they speak.<p>To reiterate, "American Psycho" may not be everyone's cup of cinematic tea, but those looking for a sharp little satire of modern American life will find some definite rewards.</p></br><a href="../users/A38U2M9OAEJAXJ.html">A38U2M9OAEJAXJ</a><br/><p>Whether we know it or not, many of us have co-workers who are just like Patrick Bateman.  On the outside they exude confidence, style, and success, and they know exactly what to say and when to say it.  But on the inside lurks a fragmented soul ready to snap at any given moment.  Welsh actor Christian Bale, in one of the best performances you will ever see, brings to life Patrick Bateman, the Wall Street yuppie who works at Pierce & Pierce by day and is a serial killer by night.  In adapting the controversial and unpleasant book by Bret Easton Ellis, director Mary Harron purges much of the violence and misogyny that made the novel one of the most despised and misunderstood pieces of literature in the last 20 years.  What remains is the book's twisted sense of humor.  This isn't a slasher film but rather a clever satire on the yuppie lifestyle of the late 1980s.  Speaking in a pitch-perfect American accent that recalls a game-show host, Bale perfectly embodies his character physically and emotionally.  His performance makes you simultaneously laugh at, pity, and fear Bateman.  Jared Leto is also good in his brief role as Paul Allen (in the book it's Paul Owen; why his name is changed in the film, I don't know); Chlo? Sevigny also stands out as Patrick's timid assistant, and Reese Witherspoon shines as his clueless and self-absorbed fiancee.  This is the unedited version, which has a few additional flashes of nudity in one of the sex scenes.  The difference is so minimal, you'd hardly notice it, showing how uptight the MPAA can get when it comes to editing films.  Nonetheless, "American Psycho" is a disturbing but clever film that was one of the best of 2000.  It comes highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>After watching this film twice, I am of the opinion that it really is a satire rather than a horror film. I say this because the majority of the film is really about Patrick Bateman's pitiful attempt to define himself through his obsession with his model-like appearance, his outlandish purchases (such as two Robert Longo drawings in his living room), music selections, and his choices in nightclubs and restaurants. The man is adrift with no real meaning in his life, and thus this is why he is "psycho".<br /><br />He demeans women, seeing them as little more than sex objects or status symbols. He is engaged to a woman (played by Reese Witherspoon) who sees men in the same way he sees women, which is convenient for a while but eventually results in a rupture of the relationship.<br /><br />He is hyper competitive and overly sensitive to the trappings of success. He becomes especially competitive with a colleague Paul Allen (played by Jared Leto) who has gained recognition that Patrick lacks and seeks.<br /><br />Early in the film Patrick lapses into psychotic halucinatory behavior, thinking that he is killing the women he picks up and the collegues who out shine him at work. We are given considerable hints throughout the film that his murders are figments of his imagination. I realize that some viewers will not interpret the film in this manner at all, but I suggest they carefully watch the film and seek the clues that Patrick is hallucinating and thus imaging that his desire to kill is in fact overt behaviors rather than impulsive thoughts.<br /><br />So why is he an American Psycho? Because he is a terrible empty shell of a person, driven to self definition by the American marketplace. The poor fellow had no original opinions. He actually memorizes CD covers as substitutes for developing an original opinion of the pop music that is integrated throughout the film.<br /><br />And yet, in some ways this really is a horror film, for what could be more horrible that a meaningless existance? The author of the book, Bret Easton Ellis, would let us know that many people experience this horror every day.<br /><br />The film is actually very good and unfortunately misunderstood and underestimated by most viewers.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>When I first saw this in the cinema in April 2000 I hated it. But I watched it with the wrong attitude. I was judging American Psycho as a horror film. Which it certainly is NOT. It's about (as the film constantly says) a complete [loser]. He's no friends. Unable to communicate on any level with anyone of his superficial, yuppie colleagues (some of which don't even know his name), takes far, far too much pride in his appearance and has way, way to much love for his material possessions. He is Patrick Bateman. And fitting in/looking normal/being just like everyone else is the toughest thing in his life. But murder, misogyny, degradation and mutilation is what he secretly longs for. It's really only Huey Lewis and the News that prevents him from doing so. <p>American Psycho is full scenes that are tough to watch. You'll be watching them through the gaps between your fingers. How can you not squirm as Patrick Bateman looks in the mirror smiling, flexing his muscles, while having sex with a call girl? Or taking the whole business card thing WAY too seriously? Other times the film is just laugh out loud hilarious. Bateman tells Willem Dafoe's detective he would love to help him with his case but he has a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable. Come on! Cliff Huxtable??? Or how about the scene in the Men's Room when Patrick attempts to strangle the gay guy? <p>Don't watch this as a horror film. It's a comic, drama-tragedy. Patrick Bateman is a disaster waiting to happen. And his inability to stay connected to the world around him is a wicked delight. Though his world of slick, cocaine-snorting, superficial, Wall Street yuppies of 80s credibility is not really the thing anyone would want to be connected to. Maybe he's better off as a psycho with no pals.<p>The DVD has a great looking 2.35:1 anamorphic picture and a loud, well produced Dolby 5.1 soundtrack. The extras (apart from the deleted scenes), unfortunately, are pathetic.e movie with a scene of  Bateman discussing his morning facial cream routine) that the point of the  satire is nearly lost: Without the fickle trends of society, Bateman is an  empty shell. Save his greed and bloodlust, he is a robot.<p>Harron tones  down the violence to a lesser degree - although it is no less gruesome; the  scene where Bateman, nude and bloody, chases a hooker with a chainsaw is an  edge-of-the-seater - and emphasizes the story's taking place in the "Me  Decade" with appropriate song and fashion that add to one's enjoyment of  the film.<p>Despite a lame "Is Patrick really nutso?" twist that hurts the  movie, the point is not lost here, and Harron has a solid sophomore hit on  her hands.<p>Bale shines as Bateman, making us thank God the powers that be  did not go with Leonardo DiCaprio as they at one point hoped to. Whether  he's stiff, menacing, dryly sarcastic, tortured or over the edge psychotic,  Bale is mesmerizing. If there's any justice in the world, Patrick Bateman  will be a career maker.<p>Too bad the supporting actors don't fare as well.  With the exception of Matt Ross, who steals his scenes as a homosexual  co-worker of Bateman's in a memorable bathroom confrontation, all other  actors are window dressing. Witherspoon's role is written so blandly  anybody could have played it, while Sevigny is incredible annoying as her  characer moons over Patrick. Willem Dafoe is amiable enough as a detective  investigating one of Bateman's crimes, but ... this is Bale's movie.<p>It's  a wild ride that gets a little hazy in parts, but is certainly enjoyable in  most places.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>"American Psycho" (2000) didn't look like a promising film. On the surface, the plot is essentially the reverse of "Deathwish." In "Deathwish" a respectable citizen in New York City forsakes the law to secretly kill criminal scumbags in the name of justice; in "American Psycho" a scumbag in New York City masquerades as a respectable citizen while secretly murdering innocent people.<br /><br />I didn't think I'd like this film because the main character is, well, an American psycho (Christian Bale), which means it's impossible to care about him or root for him. In fact, pretty much the only people in the film that you might care about or root for are the psycho's secretary, Jean, and the detective (Willem Dafoe).<br /><br />So the film starts off with a strike against it, but then I found myself getting into the story, meaning I was entertained, and that's the name of the game in cinema.<br /><br />I also got the joke. "American Psycho" is not a serious horror movie or drama; it's a black comedy or satire. As such, it's impossible to take seriously and be scared; and there are quite a few amusing or laugh-out-loud scenes (like the head in the fridge).<br /><br />Thankfully, "American Psycho" has meaning beyond the surface. It's a commentary on the emptiness of America's materialistic, irreligious modern culture. Our innate moral compass has been lost with the passing of spiritual faith as we desperately search for meaning in secularism, materialism, pompous titles and the outward images of success, which generally leaves us looking good, but spiritually bereft. Life becomes virtually meaningless beyond the mechanics of the grind and everything that goes into it. People become mere objects to compete with or fulfill selfish desires. Etcetera.<br /><br />I don't know if it's because of Bale's subsequent fame as the Batman or what, but "American Psycho" has become a popular cult film since its poor performance at the box office in 2000.<br /><br />This is a hard R-rated film, so stay away if you're not in the mood for heaps of violence, gore, nudity, sex and cussing.<br /><br />GRADE: B-</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Christian Bale and Chloe Sevigny star in this 2000 thriller<br />based on the novel.

The movie satirizes the yuppie culture of materialism, using a modern day "Ted Bundy" serial killer.  American Psycho is set in the 1980's and Patrick Bateman is a broker in New York.  His colleagues are young men his age, who vie for the best business cards, restaurant reservations, ties, and suits.  It all seems so meaningless and sterile as they arrogantly discuss what trendy restaurant to eat dinner at each night at a local club.<br /><br />Patrick Batemen lives in a expensive New York apartment and starts each morning with a shower and narcissistic regimen of skin care.  He is misogynistic, and self centered, spending time with same-aged colleagues sharing a obsession over classy business cards, designer glasses, ties and suits.  His public personality hides a murderous rage at small frustrations.  When his anger mounts then it is taken out on anyone, including his do-worker, prostitutes, homeless men and models.  During the murders he plays music and critiques the songs of Huey Lewis and Phil Collins.  Chloe Sevigny plays Patrick's secretary and Reese Witherspoon plays his fiance.  Both are wonderful actresses and give the movie some depth.  Although there are many murders in the movie, the actual killing scenes are not graphic, although plenty of blood and bodies are seen throughout.  Patrick gets away with everything with his public persona - clean cut professional - just like Ted Bundy.  Even as Patrick is loading a full body bag in the car a friend comes up and comments what a gorgeous bag - is it Armani?  Patrick grunts and groans as he puts the body in the trunk and responds the correct designer.  There is no one who really suspects him, and he has a lawyer who covers his trial when an outside detective starts asking questions.  He is highly protected  in a world of money and style.<br /><br />American Psycho is a great satire on Yuppie culture.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>Christan Bale is one of my favorite actors and even though many conisder his work in Empire Of The Sun to be his breakthrough performance for me it's all about American Psycho. American Psycho was clearly one of the best movies released in the year 2000. The film is a thinking person horror movie and has humor and one of the best portyals of a serial killer in recent years.

On the one hand we have a social satire, that takes a comic look back at successful young Wall Street types of the 80's. This story focuses on a group of friends who are always trying to one up each other with their lavish lifestyles. The over personification of these guys is totally laughable as they are so highly competetive that even the look of their business cards becomes an obsession with them.<br /><br />On the other hand we have, Patrick Bateman, the most obsessive of them all. Patrick's problems go much deeper than his need to compete. His appetite for the best things in life, takes us into the deep dark world of a serial killer. Patrick goes on chilling murder spree that rivals 'Freddy" and "Jason' and will have you on the edge of your seat. Even with a detective questioning his every move, his urge to kill is uncontrollable.<br /><br />These two storylines constantly intertwining, made this a tough one for me to reconcile. Adjusting to the change of mood in every other scene made it hard to enjoy this otherwise well made film.<br /><br />The cast including Christian Bale as the psychotic Bateman,Willem Dafoe(who didn't get nearly enough screen time), as the persistent detective, Reese Witherspoon as the immaculate fiancee,Chloe Sevigny,Jared Leto, Josh Lucas and Samantha Mathis are all impeccable in their performances. Wonderful camera work by Andrzej Sekula and the music of John Cale help make this film worth the view. It is also a film that will leave you wanting to talk about it afterwards, as there may be different interpretations on the final outcome(this is something I always enjoy). And all those things together are definately worth at least 3 stars in my book.<br /><br />The DVD is excellent. The surround sound is fabulous in DD5.1. The picture is beautifully presented in anamorphic widescreen. There are captions in English and may also be viewed in French(also 5.1). There are several special feautres including an interview with Christian Bale, a making of featurette(these were a big help in understanding this film), some production notes and a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />Worth checking out for those that have a taste for something different.

Perhaps I'm being premature in arguing that this graphic novel about a rich but soulless young man in the throes of materialistic excess ranks alongside such monumental novels as Sinclair Lewis's "Main Street" or Theodore Dreiser's "An American Tragedy," but that's exactly what I am saying. I predict that the coming decades will see Ellis's novel elevated to the pantheon of great American literature, a novel so indicative of its time and place that future generations will read it in order to gain insight into certain segments of our culture. Like other great novels about the American experience, "American Psycho" doesn't cover all the bases--America is too diverse for a single author to capture its total essence in a single novel. But what it does touch upon strikes at a central tenet of our society, namely our greed for things and our inability to strike a balance between laissez-faire capitalism and regulated market systems. We learned in the 1980s that "Greed is good." Ellis's novel shows us how that greed taken to its farthest extension is anything but good.<br /><br />Predictably, someone made a film based on the book--a director named Mary Harron to be exact--starring Christian Bale as the titular psycho Patrick Bateman. Pat seems to have everything the American dream promises: good looks, money, a good lineage, an ivy league education, beautiful women, nice digs, all the accoutrements that come with being a member of the American social elite. He is also, according to his own observations, a raving lunatic prone to outbursts of horrific violence. The smallest incidents cause our anti-hero to embark on epic excursions of bloody mayhem, from a colleague producing a better business card than the ones Patrick carries to a homeless man on the street who has the temerity to ask for money. He has a propensity to blurt out the most outrageous statements to his equally slick pals and numerous girlfriends, statements about heads on sticks and how he works in "murders and executions," but no one seems to notice or care that much. Even more amazing, no one seems to notice Patrick Bateman lapsing into murderous insanity. But why would they? He's one of them, one of the cream of the crop, and is certainly not the sort of scoundrel who would murder and maim harridans, business associates, or anyone else who happens to cross his path.<br /><br />In fact, we can never be entirely sure the murders and tortures are reality or just figments of Bateman's fragmented and vacuous personality. More likely these egregious acts, acts which include chasing a woman around an apartment building with a chainsaw or burying an axe in the noggin of an associate named Paul Allen (Jared Leto), represent attempts to feel something beyond the mere superficiality provided by material goods. Then again, maybe not. A cop named Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe) does turn up at Bateman's office from time to time to inquire about the whereabouts of the aforementioned Allen. It's to the film's credit that we can never quite say for sure if Bateman is responsible for all of these atrocities, but that is also the conclusion we reach with the book. What we know for certain is how useless this guy's life really is. All he does is show up for work so he can goof off, listen to music, try and obtain reservations at the latest hip restaurants, and exercise. He's really nothing and he knows it. Watching these yuppies preen and prance through expensive set pieces evokes an equally useless class of do-nothings, i.e. the European nobility of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Come to think of it, some of those barons, dukes, and earls engaged in mass murder as well.<br /><br />The only problem I had with the film version of "American Psycho" isn't really a major problem at all. In order to get a rating that would allow theaters to show the picture, Harron had to tone down the gore considerably. The book is loaded with stomach churning descriptions of Bateman's atrocities that only get worse as his insanity increases. Even an unrated version of the film couldn't begin to bring to the screen many of these nightmares, but that's o.k. What we do get is highly disturbing thanks largely to the marvelous skills of actor Christian Bale in the lead role. In a film loaded with talent--including Chloe Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, Jared Leto, Josh Lucas, and Willem Dafoe--Bale easily holds his own and then some as the savage psychotic. His voiceovers describing his inner sensations send chills down the spine yet he's equally at ease with the book's black humor. It's amazing there are times you won't know whether you should laugh or shriek in terror at Bateman's latest escapade. If you haven't read the book, which I recommend before watching the film, you might need to view the picture several times to absorb the bleak social commentary.<br /><br />Extras on the disc include production notes, cast biographies, a trailer, an interview with Bale, and a making of featurette. I'll leave you with a typical Bateman statement: "There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed. My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone, in fact I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no one to escape, but even after admitting this there is no catharsis, my punishment continues to elude me, and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself. No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling. This confession has meant nothing." Enough said, eh?</p></br><a href="../users/A6DOCZ10B7JAJ.html">A6DOCZ10B7JAJ</a><br/><p>What's for dinner tonight?  Squid ravioli or a swordfish meatloaf w/ onion marmalade?  Or what 5 star restaurant has the best bathroom to do some coke in?  These are the type of questions Patrick Bateman (Bale) and his co-workers face in American Psycho.<br />This movie is a satirical look at yuppie Wall Street America.  Bateman does have an unsquenchable bloodlust lingering beneath his pristine corporate image.  But there are some surreal aspects to the fatal crimes that makes you wonder what's factual and what's merely a product of his imagination.<br />The 80's setting is really captured through the music that Patrick Bateman listens to and adores.  And yes, there is a strong hint that if you love Huey Lewis, Phil Collins, Robert Palmer, and Whitney Houston, you're crazy too.<br />Plus you're probably a little psycho if you use six different facial & body cleansers, along with your daily mudd mask, anti-aging eye balm, and after-shave lotion with little or no alcohol (because alcohol dries the skin).<br />There are many other instances where this movie pokes fun at vain and shallow people.  It also leaves unanswered questions that are fun to contemplate.  I give it a big thumbs up.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Mary Harron's film is a depiction of the Bret Easton Ellis (Rules of Attraction, Less Than Zero) controversial novel of the same name.  It's only significant difference is that it leaves out some of the more gruesome scenarios in Ellis's book.  I'm not sure whether that's a drawback or not but there was some rage missing in our killer's actions.  The film operates as a first person narrative and contains the same kind of oddball combinations of extreme violence and dark humor.  This kind of humor is exactly my kind of humor, so I laughed at American Psycho throughout.  Mary Harron also seemed to recognize that the novel was old enough that she should approach the film as a period piece and she executes this well.  Everything about this movie feels like the late 1980s.  She creates a virtual remake of the novel as I pictured it in my head years ago.  From what I understand Harron also fought hard to keep the role of Patrick Bateman (the title character and the story's protagonist) in the capable hands of Christian Bale.  Bale is outstanding here and Harron really seems to be a directorial force with her actors.<br /><br />Patrick Bateman is a 27 year-old wealthy and successful investor.  He is clearly a product of a privileged and ultra-competitive background.  We follow him around and listen to all of his observations of the world he lives in.  This is of course the yuppie culture of the 1980s. Perhaps Bateman is the extreme yuppie and a harbinger to the ills of this socially produced subgroup and the culture they exist in.  As it turns out his world features the substantiality that he is indeed a murderer.  Unfortunately no one seems to notice this, despite his blatant and at times hilariously dry claims that he is a psycho.  Evidence of his murders also seemed to disappear quite easily.  American Psycho, like the novel, is a great satire that might leave viewers with some frustrating questions in the end.  What was real and what was imaginary?<br /><br />The rest of the cast includes Wilem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Chlo? Sevigny, and Reese Witherspoon.  All are fairly effective within their roles but the film weighed heavily on Bale's performance.  He understands Patrick Bateman and makes the character the mind-blowingly shallow and overly competitive monster he is.<br /><br />The thing that surprises most is that a great female director like Harron decided to take on a story so pervasively accused of misogyny.  Harron's other films are about a radical feminist (Valerie Salanas in I Shot Andy Warhol) and an icon of women's liberation (Bettie Page in The Notorious Bettie Page).  I almost think she intentionally went against the grain here to break out of the mold Hollywood can often create for women and minority directors.  Good for her.  Her movies are interesting and American Psycho is a stand-out.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>In all honesty, the first three quarters of `American Psycho' is flawless.  I have made my distain for this film obvious to many people but upon reflection even I must admit that the majority of its parts are pure brilliance.  And then the fourth quarter comes along and then entire film falls to pieces.  Honestly I don't think that Mary Harron understood Bret Easton Ellis' novel.  I am a huge fan of the book (I have it listed as one of the top five books everyone should own) and have learnt to embrace its controversial and disturbing overtones because underneath it all `American Psycho' (the novel) is a masterful depiction of humanity at its realist.  I know that it has been noted that Ellis' enjoyed this movie adaptation, and maybe that should mean something for me, but I still can't help but gawk at its overly comical ending.<br /><br />When you read `American Psycho' it gets under your skin; first because of the gross and graphic depictions of murder and mayhem, but ultimately it crawls beneath you because you begin to rationalize with inhumanity.  You begin to realize that this man is trapped, as are you and I, in a world that places so much value on the clothes we wear and the toys we own that the value of another's life is tragically degraded.  What garners more attention; the murder of a homeless man or a blowout sale at JCPenney?  The answer is as obvious as it is heartbreaking.<br /><br />Mary Harron's adaptation loses that for me.  In the end Patrick Bateman is degraded to the depiction of a crazed lunatic as apposed to the ultimate portrayal of a society lost.  He's made fun of as apposed to being made fear-inspiring.  I vividly remember an image of a crouched over Christian Bale feasting on human flesh and I remember shaking my head in disgust for what Ellis' brilliant work of modern literature had been reduced to.<br /><br />This has nothing to do with the fantastic acting within this film, which I feel compelled to point out.  Christian Bale serves up one of the greatest performances of his career and certainly one of the best of that given year (can you say Oscar snub).  He truly gets inside Patrick Bateman, residing within his delusions and creating a truly terrifying as well as understandable character.  Chloe Sevigny also delivers as Bateman's secretary Jean.  Her scene within his apartment, the scene with the nail gun, is my favorite scene in the film.  Reese Witherspoon is great here, if not underused, and Jared Leto has one of the most memorable scenes here (the one scene in the film that really crawled beneath my skin).<br /><br />You know, while I'm on that subject I might as well stay on that subject.  Jared Leto plays Paul Allen, one of Bateman's `victims'.  The murder scene is graphic yet done in a mesmerizing satirical way that truly captures what Ellis' novel was all about.  Why oh why could the climax of this film have been done in the same splendid manner?  I'm baffled because one scene is pure brilliance while the other is C-Grade cheesiness.<br /><br />I just want to throw my hands up in dire frustration.<br /><br />In the end I guess I'm forced to give this the thumbs down.  It could have been such a fantastic film; maybe even the best of the year.  The source material, while completely and understandably controversial and offensive, is one of the greatest and most influential novels to have ever been penned.  Mary Harron had a major opportunity here to build on greatness and deliver something the world has never seen.  A lot of critics praised this movie; which goes to show that I will never understand this society's idea of a critic.  It begins with such masterful potential and it builds on it with such fire only to freefall into stupidity and destroys everything it worked so hard to accomplish.  I give it three stars, nothing more and nothing less; which is sad because during its first three quarters I was so sure it would receive nothing but praise from me.  Bale is genius, I will give this movie that, but even his brilliance could not save this film from itself.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O5T5VAQ3TD17.html">A3O5T5VAQ3TD17</a><br/><p>I love this film, It's one of those I watch over and over again. I find myself still laughing at some scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U5JCXIXTGSLN.html">A3U5JCXIXTGSLN</a><br/><p>I read "American Psycho" before I saw the movie and I'm very glad I did. My reading the book prepared me for the disturbing images I would ultimately see on the screen. Christian Bale did an excellent job of portraying the monstrous yet calm Patrick Bateman in a story that takes place in the 1980s.<p>The story mainly revolves around a man in his twenties who is very successful on Wall Street in New York City. He seems very charming and normal to just about all who meet him - he even has a fiance played very well by Reese Witherspoon. However, what these people don't know is that under that charming exterior lies a vicious killer who must satisfy his need to kill whenever the mood strikes. Even though he does possess the traits of a killer, there are also some lighter scenes in the movie. The scene where Patrick and his co-workers discuss their business cards will bring a smile to your face. It's amazing how the type of paper or ink used on a card can be so important and almost seem life-threatening to these men. Their entire level of status rested upon a small card.<p>You will probably find yourself in shock throughout most of the film, but sometimes that can be a good thing. This is not a regular film that one goes to see for enjoyment. This film was made to make you feel uncomfortable and make you take a serious look at the sort of things that go on in the world everyday. The ending will have you second-guessing yourself and make you think, "How did that happen?" This movie is not for the faint of heart, but if you think you are up to challenge of watching this film, I'd recommend it!</p></br><a href="../users/A363QRXP83K8ZE.html">A363QRXP83K8ZE</a><br/><p>American Psycho, the book, seems like an easy fit to the screen in terms of visuals.  But what's difficult to transfer to the film is the actual excess of style.  For instance, in the book you can note the actual style in which the book is structured.  There are entire chapters that, by the style they're done in and the placement they're given, tell the reader that they are non-essential.  The rants on Phil Collins, Huey Lewis and the News--these run 5-6 pages in the book and are best skipped.  (Though if you go through them you find some great lines.)  In a film it's difficult to do that because they would equate to 5 more minutes on the running time and a bored audience.  <p>Anyway, onto the film.  I thought American Psycho was as good an adaptation as anyone could hope for if they're a fan of the book.  Mary Harron (a female director making the ultimate movie about "men behaving badly" as she puts it in the featurette) does two things: she makes the film a real treat for those who read the book, and she makes the film funny and witty enough for those just wondering what the fuss is.  Plenty of people will figure out what the book must have been like once they see the movie.<p>I don't where to start except to say you owe it yourself to see this excellent independent film.  ...  Christian Bale is amazing as Patrick Bateman.  The accent is great, the facial expressions priceless (that look he gets when examining a rival's business card), the whole play he does on the character.  It looks like everyone gets what Ellis was doing with the book.  Everyone may hear about the notoriety of the book, but in the end American Psycho was the blackest of comedies, forcing the reader to try and laugh at moments that are interspersed with some of the most disturbing passages I've read in a long time.  <p>The filmmakers do an incredible and difficult job of cutting the book down to filmable size.  It's a great job of picking scenes from the book for the screen, meanwhile leaving out entire sections and characters (Bethanie, his ex-girlfriend) but not compromising the whole thing.  This could be a 3 hour movie, instead it's under 100 minutes and feels just right.  <p>Christian Bale is so commanding as Bateman that he gives a real face to the narrator of the book.  The film even keeps some of the violence, but watching those scenes from the book played off they take on a humerous tone that the black and white page was hiding well.  For instance, the murder of Al, the bum, becomes funny when Bateman starts saying those lines.  The film is not a comedy, it's a not horror movie, it's not a drama.  It's a very vicious satire that combines all of those elements and stays smart.  <p>I don't see a more famous Hollywood or not-Hollywood director making this without compromising more of the book in favor of personal style.  <p>Interesting to note: For some reason the UK region DVD (which you can't play over here) has 6 deleted scenes!  The American DVD has a number of nice extras, but why would they leave off the deleted scenes?  Sure, they're cutting room floor, but at least 2 of the scenes would have fit nicely into the film, and the other bits are funny as well.  ... <p>This is a highly recommended film for anyone with a little dark side, no matter how little.  It's funny and visually provoking enough for many people to fall in love with this small production and appreciate cruel satire and the blackest humor.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>Possessed by the American Dream described to denizens of the 1980s, Patrick Bateman looks and acts the potentially powerful part that everyone seems to want. Showcasing himself as an almost perfect member of the human species possessed by intellect and a higher class superiority, he lives the part of the showman and many a person seems to buy into this presentation. Simply ask his secretary or the droves of females that flock about him, or the ones he approaches and finds thrown aback by the presentation of sophistication and charm within his demeanor. And what's not to like, really, about a member of the upper echelon of society with power, prowess, money, and a keen understanding of how the inner workings of the fraternally upper-class pecking order at his disposal? Besides, he is predisposed when it comes to echoing the sentimentality of success; owning the perfect ensemble, working out to fine-tune the garb underneath those wrappings, and taking great care to ward off blemishes that would others attempt to assail his skin and hair. On top of that he owns a seemingly grandiose apartment, a vast array of electronics that would cost a small fortune, and is fully equipped to feast on the entertainment of the time - especially in the realm of music. Going further, he also understands the ins and outs of wining and dining, partying and the prospective drug use that seems to follow closely in suit, and how to use the vacancies existing within others to benefit himself and further his own needs, and how to starkly mark his territory in the heat of the moment. And then there's his other hobbies...<p>Based loosely on the trails and tribulations echoed throughout Bret Easton Ellis's book, American Psycho - and then only in the fact that some scenes are mimicked in an out-of-order fashion and that disfunctionalities of our main character, Mr. Bateman, are reproduced with stunning beauty -- this movie offers something different to people looking for more than mundaneness housed within murder. While its true that the level of violence that feeds Bateman between the books edges isn't showcased here and is instead left in commentary and implied snippets that sometime explode into the occasional outburst that tries to coat the screen, there are still windows looking into the beast inflicting Patrick's mentality. In fact, American Psycho is, in many ways, a breath of fresh air in a genre that otherwise suffers the platitudes of many and many a directorial mind, feeding its viewer images of a numbing world in which Bateman compares the quality of business cards, the needs to maintain his body, and indulges the monster within the illusion maintained by the man. <p>Readers that approved of the character and his barbed wit will no doubt enjoy Bale's portrayal of the malicious mindset inflicting our upper-class killer, and might actually be surprised at the number of scenes they recognize from the book's pages. Even those who found the book disturbing should enjoy this softer, less graphic portrayal of Bateman's candor, seeing only bits and pieces of the man that is destined to be remembered as a social stamp dictating the excesses of the 80s for generations that weren't privy its influence firsthand.</p></br><a href="../users/AS7B4W4KOPQNV.html">AS7B4W4KOPQNV</a><br/><p>This movie was about a total psycho, Patrick (Christian Bale), who has a lust for killing people.  Patrick is very vain and kills people very casually, it's humorous how bazaar he is.  I thought it was pretty funny, but a little too weird at times.  I wouldn't reccomend it to just anyone, not all people are able to find humor in a crazy businessman that goes around on killing sprees.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6KZT0QG6UKB.html">A3D6KZT0QG6UKB</a><br/><p>This was the book that I avoided because it was politically correct to avoid it and as much as I tried to avoid that whole mindset, I was a college student. I also was left unimpressed with Ellis' second &quot;die yuppie scum&quot; novel Rules of Attraction.<p>But after this movie, I gotta go and read it. It's such an evil parody of the vacant yuppie moron, that I couldn't help but love the movie. Work for a Web design startup company with a CFO, CEO, COO or whatever who doesn't know anything and jsut thought that Web design would be a great way to supplement some of the losses from his telemarketing businesses, and you too will love the nastiness heaped upon yuppies by Brett Easton Ellis.<p>A time capsule to when yuppies were considered cool, this young Republican does the things that yuppies do -- obsess over clothing, business cards, restaurant reservations while killing off homeless people and women on a weekly basis. And while Ivan Boesky and Milliken killed people by screwing up their paychecks or funding Contra rebels, Patrick Bateman takes a more hands-on approach.<p>The funniest part of the movie is the music. Huey Lewis, Whitney Houston and the rest of the superficial music is used for maximum effect with Bale giving long lectures on the importance of this music as if it really has any depth. The kill scene to the tune of Seu-seu-sudio cracks me up every time I think of it.<p>At times the movie gets a little too long and repeats the same jokes (how many people have to be killed due to nicer business cards) but it moves along and you forgive it even if it might be about 20 minutes too long.<p>Funny movie, violence is not too terrible, and it's a great way to laugh at yuppies. What's not to recommend?</p></br><a href="../users/AK2AQIULQDFS5.html">AK2AQIULQDFS5</a><br/><p>Why do you think movies like this rarely cross the 10 million box office mark, while &quot;Big Daddy&quot; and &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; easily cross the 100 million mark... One might answer this question like this... &quot;People are Stupid&quot;.. but that's not the answer, it's because people (unlike critics) go to the movies for Entertainment.. If all the critics that raved about &quot;American Psycho&quot; had used the word Entertaining, it would have made about 60-80 million, and if it had Leonardo De Caprio like the producers wanted, it would be up with &quot;Titanic&quot;. <p>&quot;American Psycho&quot; is highly entertaining the whole way through, hysterically funny most of the way through and Ultra-violent for about 10 seconds, you average freddy 27 and Jason 49 have double the blood, triple the body-count and a &quot;Video Premiere&quot; sticker on there video cover. It really is not very violent at all. (am I just getting sicker, or is the world over-populated by cry-babies) If the film had been released in the time it was set, (the 80's) it would be slapped with a PG 13, released alongside &quot;Commando&quot;, &quot;Running Man&quot; and &quot;Cobra&quot;, it would become a cult favourite with pre-teens, and would be lost among the sea of violent 80's videos at your local Blockbuster.<p>As your probably well aware, this film features &quot;SOCIAL COMMENTARY&quot; and &quot;SATIRE&quot;, these three words are scarier to the general public than &quot;PAULY SHORE&quot; and &quot;CHUCK NORRIS&quot;. The Second Roger Ebert and his peers utter those three words the box office drops 85%.

However, my film group assured me that the movie version was an utter transformation of the novel and Christian Bale, as the lead, a major acting discovery.  The group was right. Rewritten with black humor at its core, this tale of the consummate yuppie of the 1980s, who is also a serial killer, held me spellbound, when I wasn't LOL.  Bale is also interviewed on the DVD version and you can barely tell he is the same person as the character he plays, Patrick Bateman.  This is not a mad-slasher film like &quot;Nightmare On Elm Street&quot;.  So if you are looking for that kind of film, this will not fit the bill.  This is an exploration of the dark underside of a Harvard educated, privileged young CEO and his cohorts on Wall Street and the &quot;horror&quot; is how right the film feels. There is the issue raised of how real Bateman's murders are versus a complete breakdown of his psyche taking place instead.  However, this becomes one of the interesting points to debate after seeing this film and is not easily answered.  I'm keeping my eye peeled for the next film Christian Bale makes as he is an actor who could do marvelous work in the years ahead.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>Relatively speaking, that is.<br /><br />This is an interesting, if a bit over the top, portrait of a psychopath gone bananas.  Presented in white, white, and more white so that the red, red, red of the blood will be all the more contrasting, this approach coincides with the ultra, ultra sophistication of the Harvard and Yale grads working on Wall Street who are so, so very venal and superficial.  This is a slasher film that will appeal equally to heartlanders on a date night, and to those blue coasters who need a little titillation.<br /><br />[And then suddenly Bateman takes over my review]:<br /><br />Yeah, RIGHT.  Who cares.<br /><br />Personally, I don't usually watch slasher films, being above that kind of stuff, but this is stylishly done--and I do like style in my blood splattering.  Where director Mary Herron screws up is in not realizing that only an idiot sociopath would be so stupid and self-destructive as to so carelessly kill so many people.  If there is one thing a sociopath never wants to do is to bring pain upon himself.  Don't you think, considering the ending, that Bateman is going to be caught?  Huh?<br /><br />[Resuming control of my review and droning on]:<br /><br />...although the terms "sociopath" and "psychopath" are often used interchangeably, there is a clear tendency for "psychopath" to be reserved for violent sociopaths.  Another reason "psychopath" is correct is because this is a postmodern update of the classic Hitchcock slasher movie Psycho (1960) starring...<br /><br />[Again taking over]:<br /><br />Shut up. Who cares who it starred?  The point here is that this film--we're talking about MY film-- is a TOTALLY INACCURATE portrait of a true psycho--I mean sociopath.  We don't make ourselves so vulnerable to the Criminal Justice System.  We are NOT intent on self-destruction.  Believe me if I ever decide to get my jollies by slashing someone up, I will make absolutely sure I can get away with it.  Only low IQ psychos like Scott Peterson get caught.  And, by the way, what is with this chainsaw business?  I mean he tosses it down the stairwell so that it crashes on the floor from how many stories above, and it still works so he can use it on "Christie"?  Give me a break.<br /><br />Oh.  You think that it hit her while still running, huh?  Ha, ha, ha!  Nice shot, dude.<br /><br />[Again resuming control]:<br /><br />..notice too that the ending allows for a sequel, yet has all the trappings of an ending.  We know that he is going to be caught and yet...<br /><br />[Coming back out of the screen...]:<br /><br />We know nothing.  The cops are stupid.  Nobody will believe...<br /><br />[Shoving him back in...]:<br /><br />...the emphasis on the conspicuous consumption of expensive food and wine, drugs, cigars, the indulgence of any kind of animal pleasure is, on one level a statement about our society--well, Wall Street society--but on another level is part of the usual Hollywood seduction of the audience.  This is the fast lane.  Wouldn't you like to live in the fast lane for a bit, but of course come back (after they run the credits) to your own way of life?  Isn't this the essence of escape?  Go to the movies, rent a DVD, kick up your feet and escape for awhile, and maybe there will be a catharsis, as the Greek tragedians intended.  And when you turn off the set and go to bed you realize that nothing in your life is so extreme and nothing in your life is really that far gone, and yet you have experienced vicariously an extreme emotion, and as a bonus you can feel superior to those Ivy League sickos.<br /><br />In truth this is a slightly tongue in cheek slasher/serial killer flick.  It's a satire of sorts.  It is as slick as slick can be, thoroughly engrossing with fine acting from especially Christian Bale who plays Bateman.  The direction is as tight as a well-strung banjo, the script nearly hypnotic in its seductive power, the New York ultra hip sets eye-widening as seeing the Taj Mahal while the sidebar-like satirical commentary, which (on a third level) parodies the genre, is very funny.  Best joke: they're in the restroom of a fancy eating establishment and doing some lines and the guy in the next stall gets a little uptight because they're loud and screams out, "Will you keep it down. I'm trying to do drugs!"<br /><br />Also funny is how Bateman says what he really thinks and nobody takes him seriously, and how he slips up from time to time and nobody notices.<br /><br />Incidentally, Reese Witherspoon has a minor part as exactly the kind of clueless woman who might very well marry a psychopath.  I liked this touch because I have known a few non-violent sociopaths and I often wondered if their spouses had a clue.  Clearly Reese's character did not.<br /><br />Also excellent in support was Chloe Sevigny as Jean, Bateman's adoring (but also clueless) secretary.  The idea here is that women are so bowled over by Bateman's alpha male credentials that they can't see the real person.  The only character to really realize who Bateman was (and she ended up listening to that knowledge a little late) was the streetwalker.  Well, Jean gets the picture finally as she peruses Bateman's graphic notebook.  (By the way, somebody got paid to draw all the stuff in it.  I wonder who that was.  Was there a mention in the credits, something like, sick psycho doodlings by...?)<br /><br />Finally: real life irony.  The character that Bale played in a movie immediately before this one was Jesus of Nazareth in a TV drama called Mary, Mother of Jesus (1999).  As Casey Stengel used to say, you could look it up.</p></br><a href="../users/ATE5SA1VTJNP8.html">ATE5SA1VTJNP8</a><br/><p>Bale shines in this here doozy of a cinematic tresure. One of the better black comedies with brutal horrific elements, American Psycho should strike a chord in many.<br /><br />Though it pokes fun at the 2nd greatest US president (Reagan), I couldn't help but nod my head in approval as the director brilliantly expressed her erroneuous views through this artful unfolding of a plastic man.<br /><br />Haven't read the book, but will certainly pick it up sometime soon as this film which should appeal to horror fans as well as indy film lovers and anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humor, is a memorable one for sure.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>This movie adaptation of the classic Bret Easton Ellis book is a very cool take on American culter in the 80's, and on serial killers.

If you liked "Less Than Zero" and "Rules Of Attraction" (all Ellis books/films), you will like this movie.  Who knew that the awful fashions of the 80's and the arrogance of wall street could bring so much dark humor.  Worth any price you pay to see this.<br /><br />P.S.

This film wants to give the gist of the book and it is a real success. The hero is a golden boy among other golden boys, but he knows this world is a total illusion, maybe even a lie. The lie of money, easy money and the illusion of the power of this money. His extreme personality makes him look for the most extreme sensations and these can only come from the physical suffering he can impose onto people, either by torturing them or by killing them. This is nothing but a metaphor of the vain and aimless chase for money. Money, the blood of society, is translated into the real blood of other people, and this blood has to run on his hands and face to be really felt, just like money has to run from his hands in the face of other people to express its power. He is a killer because he is unable to limit his power to the sole flow of money which is only a simulacra of the flow of life, and first of all the flow of blood. Hence the character is psychotic. But the metaphor works also the other way and society is psychotic, money is criminal, money making is an uncontroled permanent assassination of the richness of a culture that is always present in his personality. He engulfs himself in music and long dissertations on music when he starts stepping beyond the limit of sanity. So his criminal activities become the realisation of the flow of music, the linguistic flow of his highly intellectual and elaborate commentary on the music. And here is the third metaphorical level : the flow of music and his flow of commentary on the music go along with the flow of blood he criminally causes as a trespassing action beyond the sole flow of money. His wealth of intellectual dissertation on music is the cultural side of his wealth in money and this otherland leads him to bathe in a wealth of blood. Even if the film is not a masterpiece it is a thought raking and prompting adventure, and it is an adventure to enter such a film, because you feel concerned at once by this post-modern psychosis, a psychosis many of us live and try to dominate, even if unaware of it because of our good training and our desire to integrate in society.

When the film was released, the critics quickly came to the same conclusion about it. After a few months, however, better reviews of the film began to surface fromindependent critics and the like, calling it a<p>brilliant satire, wickedly funny, you know, that sort of thing. So I had to rent it. My constant repeating thought was &quot;it can't be as bad as the book.&quot;<p><p>I was right. That's not saying much.<p><p>Christian Bale (who's going to be typecast as a sleazebag if he doesn't watch out) plays Patrick Bateman, a man whose obsession with fitting in to the fast-moving upperclass Wall Street society of his father manifests itself both as an obsession with the brand names of the things he utilizes in his daily routine and as an unstoppable compulsion to murder. <p><p>Herron, who's certainly no stranger to ultraviolence (she's directed episodes of Homicide and Oz, as well as the cult hit I Shot Andy Warhol), does manage to capture a certain beauty to Bateman's homicidal rage; there's a particular scene where Bateman is chasing a prostitute (Cara Seymour) down a hallway with a chainsaw that's almost hypnotic. Where the movie fails is in the spaces between. It's almost as if Ellis wrote the novel on a bet-- &quot;can you take a perfectly shallow character and center a whole book around him?&quot; The result, in both book and film, is painfully obvious; it can be done, but it's not that much fun to experience.<p><p>This makes it all the more painful that so many wonderful roles surface in this film, not least up-and-comer Chloe Sevigny as Bateman's secretary, a woman who stands out as the true beauty in a shallow world of glamour; Jared Leto (Requiem for a Dream) as Paul Allen, a business partner of Bateman's; Reese Witherspoon as Bateman's oblivious, apoiled fiancee; and Willem Dafoe, as usual, taking a minor role (a homicide detective) and turning it into something palpably creepy.<p><p>When all is said and done, there's just not enough good here to counteract the horrid. * 1/2</p></br><a href="../users/A2NX99GVAX4TRP.html">A2NX99GVAX4TRP</a><br/><p>Imagine a combination of  Bonfire of the Vanities, Fight Club and Theatre of Death and you'll get an idea of what the film American Psycho is like-- Yuppies, testosterone, and high camp.  It zeroes in on the easiest of targets, and delights in skewering the yuppie life-style in sick and sadistic fashion.  Well that's not exactly true --  in Bret Easton Ellis' 1991 best-seller the victims were mostly  mercilessly tortured before they were brutally killed and every detail was grimly described.  It was a very disturbing book.  It almost wasn't published.<p>The film however, barely touches on the sadism and misogyny of the book.  It's a poseur film, skimming the surfaces of already overly- skimmed surfaces, making very easily made points, and getting very obvious and easy laughs.  <p>This compromise is significant when compared to the book, the book took the plunge and never came up for air.  That's why the book just won't go completely away, it might not have a lot on its mind, but it sure cuts right to the bone.  Forget about the book, though, few have actually read it.  Quite a few bought it and started to read it, but most didn't finish it.  It's too gross, too bloody, too bleak, too sick, and too repetitious.  <p>I was surprised at how much fun I had while watching the film, knowing what a watered down compromise it is.  Perhaps  watching the yuppies of the 80's getting their deserved bashing is the updated equivalent of snobby rich folks who wind up getting hit with pies in Three Stooges shorts.  It's quite fun.  <p>Another big reason for enjoying  it all so much is Christian Bale.  He plays the part with the kind of put on airs the reminded  me of some not quite human mix of Vincent Price and James Mason trapped inside a California type male model.  And though the performance is mannered, it doesn't feel forced.  It's not a performance coming from a stage actor ,who would be too keenly aware of when an audience might be reacting or laughing.  It's the type of performance a film actor like DeNiro, would have delivered to us when he was younger.  Now Bale hardly looks like an average  New Yorker as Patrick Bateman but I found the performance very entertaining. It carries the film. <p>Patrick Bateman is an extremely successful business man, his dad is a major stockholder so he's got job security and so is bored and easily distracted.  Patrick plays the competitive game with his co-workers, making sure he has the latest gadgets, the right shoes, the expensive tailored suits.  He must keep fit and look good and employs an exacting ritual involving soaps, creams, facial masks and herbal lotions to make sure he looks his best every day.  He works out obsessively, sometimes while watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  However, he barely has his own identity.  A running joke in the film has him being mistaken for one of his co-workers.  A key scene in the film involves an in-depth analysis and discussion about Business Cards.  Low key, but specially designed business cards that the young Yuppie's talk about and become envious of.  <p>Eventually we realize that Patrick Bateman (reminiscent of the similarly named Norman Bates) has a strange hobby.  He likes to kill.  We first see his dark side when a street person begs him for money.  Suddenly, Bateman savagely stabs the pitiful beggar.  Afterward he straightens his clothing, sighs, and goes about his business.  Just a way to relieve some stress, a way to cope with the pressure.<p>In other words, here's a Yuppie who has completely twisted any sense of morals to believe someone else's life is as insignificant as a two year old BMW.  Can he really get away with this? We find out he sure can.  He seems unstoppable.<p>The film could have wound up being flat and stale.  But it never is.  It's a film about style, made with some flair and it feels fresher than it has any right to.  This is because there is a  feminist viewpoint brought to the film by  Mary Harron who directed and co-wrote the film with Guinevere Turner.  The film's Patrick Bateman is a selfish, self obsessed, type A driven male.  A fragile, preening creature that is not an atypical Hollywood movie serial killer nor a killer who murders when in a  homicidal rage.  In fact this killer prefers to control the stage he kills in, often able to provide his own background music, maybe something by Huey Lewis, or  maybe something by Phil Collins. Patrick Bateman is a big fan of songs like It's Hip to Be Square and SuSudio.  To Patrick Bateman, killing is his true orgasm.  He can  control himself for short periods of time, but he's  weak, he's male and he's gonna blow sooner or later.  He's going to kill and kill again.  Maybe all this killing is even all in his mind -- nothing more than a twisted yuppie fantasy. Then again, perhaps it's not.  Whatever he can't completely control --he kills.  If something gets through to him, touches him, or exposes something vulnerable,-- he kills.  <p>Willem Dafoe playing a detective on Bateman's trail was a great idea, but nothing is done with it, and Reese Witherspoon seems the kind of future trophy wife a guy like Bateman would have.  Jared Leto  plays  the kind of Yuppie scum everyone hates.  In fact we hate this guy so much he makes Bateman palatable.  His character is named Paul Allen which is funnier now, (particularly to someone in the NorthWest) than it was when the book was written. <p>Chloe (Boys Don't Cry) Sevigny as a secretary who has a crush on Bateman makes a real impression.  She finds a sweetness within her character that humanizes and warms every scene she's in.  Without her performance the film would be a completely cold exercise in style. Cara Seymour plays a prostitute Bateman picks up to play games.  She finds a fascinating balance of fear, vulnerability, need and self-loathing in her portrayal and makes a lasting impression though her screen time is short. <p>It's a sick black comedy with some truly twisted ideas. The gore in the film however is not as plentiful as you might think and none of it feels real enough to be disturbing.<p></p></br><a href="../users/A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI.html">A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI</a><br/><p>4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiece<br /><br />Superior black comedy on the serial killer genre!<br /><br />Christian Bale is superbly, darkly comedic, as the narcissistic corporate ladder climbing executive, moonlighting as a serial killer by night.

He's a hollow shell among other hollow shells. His life consists of meaningless ritual and routine. Patrick has no sense of who he is or what he is doing. He is only aware of his own greed and inner hatred for all around him. He's a perfect physical specimen, perfectly wrapped in designer suits. His self-pampering shower regimen is a wonder to behold! When Patrick has sex with two women at once, he only notices his own reflection in the mirror. Patrick is a narcissist with no discernable personality. On the exterior, he is handsome, well groomed, and "together", while his interior is a frenzy of violence and death. Patrick is coming apart. He is no longer able to keep his inner deadness at bay. His friends are as unaware of his problems as they are of their own, living only to burn up the vast amounts of money they make in the most impressive ways possible. Patrick finally snaps, releasing his inner beast to murder those who he sees as unlike himself, which turns out to be anyone / everyone who comes in contact with him. To add to this insanity, things happen to make it unclear whether Patrick has actually killed anyone at all. Is he a prolific serial-killer or does he just have an over active and demented fantasy life? He's confused and so are we. He watches porno and slasher flicks which mysteriously look like events in his life. He carries one victim right out the front door of his penthouse apartment building, and loads it into the trunk of a cab. This leaves a long, wide trail of blood right in plain sight of many passers-by. Did this even happen? No one is certain. I loved this movie's view of the 1980s, especially the ridiculous nightlife and empty headed music. Patrick and his fellow business sharks are more plastic than flesh and blood with no concern for anyone but themselves. Patrick wants to fit in with them, but his own lack of a soul causes him nothing but misery. He is truly a repulsive creature, a living falsehood, a homicidal maniac with no real reason to kill. Patrick is the good-looking bottle of poison. Do not touch, unless you want to die! I found Patrick's utter void to be far more disturbing than the violence he perpetrates. He is totally lost, without hope or any idea of how to live. His misogeny is just a symptom of his own terminal condition. Patrick is a walking corpse. AMERICAN PSYCHO is a great character study of a man bereft of character. Bale plays his role with ease and confidence. Highly recommended...</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I've finally caught a full viewing of the "American Psycho" because every time it came on TV I would usually catch it towards the end then turn it off. First I must say I found the title somewhat misleading as I fully expected it to be another slasher flick, but it's actually a psychological thriller with a dash of satire.<br /><br />Christian Bale, as Patrick Bateman, gives a striking performance as a young, wealthy Wall Street yuppie, representing corporate America in the 1980's, where he and his peers are obsessed with getting into the trendiest restaurants and which of them possess the finest business cards. They all have the same haircut and wear the same business suits, rendering them nearly interchangeable and making for frequent cases of mistaken identity.<br /><br />Bateman, whose idea of foreplay is pontificating on the merits of his favorite 1980's songs, is disgusted with his fellow man's lust for material status and conformity. Lacking emotion, he acts on impulse and murders co-workers and clueless prostitutes while maintaining the facade of shallow, materialistic conformity. Unfortunately, the shallow lifestyle is the very thing that leaves him feeling empty inside and provokes the killings.<br /><br />The conclusion of the film leaves it to the audience to determine whether Bateman actually murdered anyone or if he merely fantasized the killings. Perhaps it was yet another case of mistaken identity, one which allowed Bateman to get away with murder. Of course American Psycho II (which I saw before part one) answers the question of whether or not he was a murderer. The movie was violent, but not as much of the book. However, I think blood and gore would have taken away from the overall satire of the film by turning it into a campy horror movie. The film had a not-so-clear subtext: The absurdity of the killer's actions and motives equal that of the rich, corporate, snob's. Directed by a woman, American Psycho is a thought-provoking study of the inner workings of a dark and twisted mind. It's a good one to watch especially for the price that Amazon is placing it for.</p></br><a href="../users/A31D8QKJXU93BT.html">A31D8QKJXU93BT</a><br/><p>Usually it's the other way around. To say that the movie is better than the book isn't saying much. Although its gruesome murders drew feminist fire and made headlines and best-seller lists, "American Psycho" isn't literature and isn't read today. But this film version is assured DVD shelf life because it largely replaces the gore with the satire that might have improved the book. It may have surprised author Bret Easton Ellis more than audiences that the movie emerged from all the controversy as a chilling, amusing examination of urban alienation. It's not the bloodbath that fans of Quentin Tarentino or George Romero might have expected.<br /><br />The movie does pay its thriller dues (and paid dearly for its NC-17 rating.) But the filmmakers have more than thrills in mind. They tip their hand with a credit sequence that draws us into a high rise world of sleek bodies and correct addresses. We see drops of blood splashing onto a white surface, then streams of blood, then - - - but wait, it's not blood at all but red syrup and rasberries garnishing plates in a Manhattan restaurant. They're being served to jaded young Wall Streeters who like to trade business cards, wisecracks and insider gossip.<br /><br />Suddenly, "American Psycho" is off and running in another direction, away from our expectations.<br /><br />Stay with it, even after I tell you that our young financier takes an axe to a colleague, has a fridge full of heads and a closet full of bodies, tapes his sexual threesomes, and that at one point he chases a blonde through his apartment building brandishing a chainsaw, naked and covered in blood. Repellent? Yes, but this is a serious movie with serious themes and a serious actor, Christian Bale, wielding the weapons. Reese Witherspoon and Willem Dafoe make appearances but Bale is the whole show. His telephone confession near the end is a sensational piece of film acting.<br /><br />Nonetheless, you may want to deprive your children and elderly parents of this cinematic experience at this particular time in their lives.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>With its extra five minutes, the film gets a completely different meaning. From a simple vision of the yuppy who is psychotic and kills to get his kicks in the financial world and goes through with it because he is a yuppy, it becomes the description of his psychosis and we do not know at the end if he has really killed or only imagined the killings. We are a lot more led into thinking that it is all a bad dream, a nightmare, a psychotic hallucination. It thus becomes the third panel of a tryptic. The American Dream first, which has to do with the dream of people arriving in the US and succeeding in making fortunes, or at least enough money to become the middle or upper middle class : the opera of American success and capitalism in its positive understanding. The American Nightmare then, which shows how those who do not succeed in making that first trip into wealth, fame and power, are led into killing, crime, at times sordid crime. These are the losers and they can only survive in this wolfish society as wolves and criminals. Capitalism leads to crime, either petty crime for the poor losers or organized crime for the more ambitious. The American psychosis is the third element, with crime developing in the mind of a successful subject in order to fuel his success. It is the story of the Golden Boys, of the Yuppies who have to be so ruthless with others in order to dominate and have the upper hand in the financial field that they develop, inside themselves, a completely murderous psychology. The only missing element is the urban paranoia that Stephen King explores in, his books, i.e. the fear of standard average Americans that their neighbors be enemies of the system, hence of them, and try to take over the system and make them slaves to their outlandish, extraterrestrial, revolutionary, dictatorial, funtamentalistic, dogmatic or sectarian objectives aiming at seizing power and then retaining it.<p>This American Psycho is absolutely essential to understand modern America. It is very well connected with the period (the 80s) and President Ronald Reagan, with his speech on the Irangate were he explains that this crime of money, warfare, power and politics is a good thing after all because it reassesses and reasserts the power of America within and without the US. Crime leads to power, and power requires crime, even if it does not justify it, and even if it does not have to be justified, except with the positive result of making America stronger in the world.<p>A great film for advanced viewers who are able to go beyond the surface of things.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/A1YC9XEDFKXPLK.html">A1YC9XEDFKXPLK</a><br/><p>American Psycho left the same impression on me that The Talented Mr. Ripley did; An unsatisfying or unfulfilled ending. It is not necessarily that I expected for Bateman to get his upcommance.Maybe I just missed the powerful subtlety of the climax of the film itself. Christian Bale is an excellent actor who must have had some kind of personal chuckle imitating an uptight, arrogant, wall-street American yuppie. Even his &quot;American&quot; accent was flawless !He played a character that you really not only hated for his literal cutthroat antics but for his annoying behavior and obessession as a neat freak !Yet, there appeared to be times in the story where his &quot;sickness&quot; was also a cry for help...like a rabid or diseased dog waiting to be caught and put out of it's misery. Bale gets 5 stars for his stellar performance.<p>My understanding of the film was that it was a twisted/dark satirical comedy coinciding with a slasher/thriller movie (sort of like a recording artist ala Sarah Brightman singing opera while on the next track singing a pop ballad all on the same album); Different genres within the same context or realm. It was not just about a nutcase hacking people, but it was also a social commentary about commercialism, consumerism, and capitalism (the &quot;holy trintiy&quot; of Wall Street and upper class America)!<p>This film falls under the category of &quot;eclectic and off-beat&quot;. While it sports all the glamor and typical nuance of a Hollywood big budget film it also serves well as an art house independent film for the Cannes Film Festival !</p></br><a href="../users/A84UFSF2SZS2W.html">A84UFSF2SZS2W</a><br/><p>Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman is vile and disgusting... just like he is supposed to be. In a tale based on a best-selling novel, this disturbing film showcases the excesses and disposability of American life in the 1980s. Bateman is a successful and financially well off New York corporate suit and tie who hangs around with other shallow and plastic carbon copies of himself. They compare business cards and become excited by the lettering and exact colours of the cards. It is quite stunning in its brutal shallowness. But when it comes to brutal, there is nothing quite so brutal as Bateman's disposable attitude toward people. About one quarter of the way into the movie, you realise that Bateman, while plastic and passionless in most ways, cannot get his aggressions and feelings out through any means of expression but violent and heinous murder. He murders prostitutes, strangers, co workers. You name it. The graphic depictions of these murders are unbelievable and caused controversy when the film was released. Strangely enough, though, all the violence and blood and gore makes it onto the screen but a sex scene between Bateman and two prostitutes was censored. The funny thing about this film is that while there are a few notable actors in it (Chloe Sevigny as Bateman's secretary, Reese Witherspoon as Bateman's fianc&eacute;e, Jared Leto as Bateman's office nemesis Paul Allen, and Samantha Mathis as Bateman's sometime sex partner) none of them is more than one dimensional, except maybe the secretary simply because she is not caught up in the plastic world which all these others occupy.  I suppose this is the point and all the actors have done their jobs well as a result. Is this a good movie worth your time? Not so sure. I went to see it at the cinema when it was first released, and I had to get up and leave halfway through because there were people all around me eating and making too much noise. The movie was good enough to sit through, but it was not gripping enough for me to regret getting up and leaving in the middle.</p></br><a href="../users/A16IXZW2A0NFR6.html">A16IXZW2A0NFR6</a><br/><p>Christian Bale turns in a great performance in this disturbing yet darkly comic tale of an 80's yuppie with a bloodlust as strong as his self obsession.

I thought it would be part of the "I Still Know What Mrs. Tingle Did With You Idle Hands Last Friday the 13th" routine, but this individual and occasionally stunning feature is a real horror film for a real adult audience.<p>Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a respected Wall Street businessman by day. Outside of work, though, he is an accomplished serial killer. After the murder of a rival, Paul Allen (Jared Leto), a private investigator (Willem Dafoe) starts to pick up his trail as Bateman starts to go mental in covering his tracks.<p>The plot is fairly thin on the ground, and the film has a poor shoot-out finale, but this is still an imaginable, carefully crafted film that is highly controversial because of it's continuous violence and rather odd sexual themes, but Christian Bale and Mary Harron work excellently and co-operate well together to make this film hugely successful with both critics and our friends at the box office. The film has a lot of laugh-out-loud funny moments, but if you're expecting a horror-thriller type, you won't be disappointed. There is no shortage of shocks; one immediately scary part is where Bateman chases his regular prostitute around a hotel room with a terrifying chainsaw sound. Christian Bale's performance is another great thing about this great movie; he perfectly catches Bateman's rise and fall with excellent acting skills and awesome narration.<p>Both hip and cool, American Psycho is an underrated little movie that deserves praise.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>The argument was that &quot;American Psycho&quot; was not really a look at a serial killer but rather a satirical expose on yuppie executives circa the mid-1980s. However, as far as I am concerned this 2000 film fails on both scores. There is a lot of blood but neither a sense of horror nor suspense, which is usually what you want to find in a thriller. As for the social satire, the problem is that the character of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) and the rest of his wall street execu-yuppies are all so fake, more reminiscent of a comedy sketch on &quot;Mad TV&quot; than anything else, and I would think the point would be to capture more of the real essence of such a life (e.g., &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; or &quot;The Boiler Room&quot;).<br /><br /> The film was directed by Mary Harron (&quot;I Shot Andy Warhol&quot;), who also did the screenplay, which probably explains why the Bret Easton Ellis novel has been toned down for the silver screen. The point being made, as near as I can tell, is that Patrick Bateman kills people, not because he is so very different from everyone else around him, but essentially because he is just like the rest of his cohorts, only more so. Some of the murders appear to be random and others the result of jealousy, but sometimes the best answer is that the death speaks to Bateman's vanity. The whole opening of &quot;American Psycho&quot; is an introduction to his narcissism, which means it provides the prime motivation for not only his murderous outbursts but also everything else in his life.<br /><br /> Because everything fits the pattern I have to work from the premise that the film is what the director intended, but it just does not achieve the desired result. My prediction is that if you bother to watch this film, then at some point you are going to burst out laughing and dollars to donuts it will be for some unintentional reason. Furthermore, as you watch the film you will find yourself thinking of a whole lot of films that suddenly look a lot better when compared to &quot;American Psycho&quot; (&quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; and &quot;Showgirls&quot; were just the first two that came to mind). I am willing to grant that Harron was trying to do something to redeem the original novel, but this film just fails across the board, whether we are talking the sex and the violence or the psychological insights and social satire.</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>In this film version of Brett Easton Ellis' often misunderstood satiric novel, the question of Bateman's real versus imaginary deeds is answered more firmly than Ellis allowed to happen in the book. Here, seemingly, at least some if not all of Patrick Bateman's violence apparently came to pass only in the space between the sick (though impeccably fashionable) Yuppie's ears. In this flashy, stylish and yet somehow still laudably low-key adaptation of a novel once thought unfilmable, Christian Bale does  a superb job of embodying a self-loving, celebrity-obsessed, brand name worshipping billionaire playboy, who tells us in lingering detail how he just happens to slay random people in his spare time. Bale trades his native Welsh accent for a polished snooty high society American one, and his comedic narcissism is refreshing in comparison with how so many other actors would have played this daunting role. The extended "cut" of American Psycho restores some of the nudity and a little of the violence left out in the theatrical release six years ago. What has never been removed is the dark humor and blistering satire that skewers the late 1980's love of excess. Fine performances abound in American Psycho, from the always magnificent Willem Dafoe, to Reese Witherspoon as Patrick's bubble-brained fianc&eacute;e, to a downtrodden Chloe Sevigny as Bateman's loyal secretary, to Samantha Mathis as a pill popping "hotbod" whose dead-end drug addiction amuses the sadistic Bateman. Filmmaker Mary Harron, who also gave us the bleak nineties art-flick, I Shot Andy Warhol, packs a lot into the relatively short run time of this movie, and in my opinion, she did a pretty fine job with some difficult material.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>I remember when "American Psycho" came out on DVD.  I was in fourth grade, and not a huge fan of horror movies.  I instantly decided that I would never watch the film, because it looked like a stupid slasher flick.  Then, a few months ago, I saw Christian Bale in "Batman Begins" and thought he was fantastic.  I looked up "American Psycho" on the IMDb and it was rated pretty high.  So I thought, what the hey, I'll give it a try.<br /><br />I'm mighty glad that I did.<br /><br />"American Psycho" is set in New York in 1987.  It revolves around Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale), a very successful lawyer who may be getting married to Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon), is having an affair with Courtney (Samantha Mathis), and is the object of his secretary's (Chloe Sevigny) affections.  But unbeknownst to his so-called "friends" and co-workers, Patrick is a killer who strikes almost at random.  And now a clever detective (Willem Dafoe) is investigating the murder of one of Patrick's victims.  Will Patrick get caught?<br /><br />The film is adapted from Bret Easton Ellis' bestselling novel, which caused quite a controversy when it was first released.  "American Psycho" the film, like the book, is about two things: one, Patrick Bateman and the murders; and two, the self-absorbed society of the 80's.  Because it's set in the 80's, it has a great soundtrack, and it makes the movie much more fun.<br /><br />Mary Harron's directing is wonderful.  During daytime scenes, the film seems bright and shiny, almost as though it were an adaptation of a Jane Austen novel.  Then there's the nighttime scenes - dark, grim, with a texture like charcoal.  Harron enhances the film immensely.<br /><br />Without a doubt, the highlight of the film is Christian Bale.  Bale's performance in this film is one of the greatest I have ever seen in my life.  He BECOMES the character.  It blew me away.  He can be mean, angry, suave, and damn funny.  The rest of the cast is good, but Bale is absolutely spectacular.<br /><br />While I can't recommend this film to everybody, I would suggest that if you don't mind the occasional blood and are looking for a humorous film, pick this one up.  Entertaining, dramatic, absorbing, funny, well-made, and with a terrific ending.  "American Psycho" is without a doubt one of the year's best.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>I'm frustrated about giving this movie 4 stars and not 5 stars but because of the random and disgusting sex scenes, it got punched down to 4. Besides that, the movie is great. I was expecting a solid movie and it blew away my expectations. Oh, and by the way, I didn't see the unrated version but saw the original theatrical version. After watching the theatrical trailer, I thought that it would be very horrifying and disturbing. But, on the contrary, my friend! The movie is absolutely hilarious! The way that it is made makes it such that you'll laugh instead of being horrified. The gruesome deaths are made in a way that they're actually really funny. Here are some funn moments:<br /><br />1. Patrick Bateman goes to get his sheets washed at a company but gets mad when they say that they can't get out the red stain on them. He claims that it's juice, cran apple. But, of course it isn't.<br /><br />2. Patrick puts newspaper all around a place where a guy's sitting at his house. And then puts on a rain coat. I wonder why.<br /><br />The movie is about Patrick Bateman, a rich Wall Street man who's obsessed with killing people. From bums to friends that he doesn't like to random women.<br /><br />The movie isn't disturbing because the violence is made in such a comic matter that you laugh out loud, and then maybe feel guilty. But, boy, it's funny. The movie is very exciting and interesting and keeps you into it until its great ending. I loved the ending and found it to be very unpredictable but makes sense. And the comic violence made sense to me now. I recommend this awesome movie and Christian Bale's perfromance is stunning. No one else could have done. Call me crazy, but I would have given him an oscar. He deserved it.<br /><br />And for parents nervous for their children that want to see it, I feel that 13 years + are good ages or mature children. The movie doesn't have a lot of cuss words but has some and the violence isn't really shown. You see the blood on Bateman's face and a body in the background but it's made comically. But, the random sex scenes are perverted so I recommend just closing your eyes. That's what I did.<br /><br />This is a worthy rent and even a worthy buy. Too bad for the sex scenes, or else it definitely deserved 5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Whatever happen to movies without a message?

He works for his fathers company, even though he doesn't really have to. He compares business cards with fellow friends and makes reservations at the newest and hottest restaurants... just because. He has a body every man wants and every girl wants to touch. He's meticulous and anal in everything he does. He's also a homicidal maniac. He kills for fun and he kills for release and he kills for hatred. After one of his murders though, a homicide cop begins too get a little too close for comfort of figuring out that Patrick could be the killer and Patrick begins to unravel from his calm demeanor.<br /><br />Never having read the book the movie is based on; I went into this movie blind. And loved it. It was a lot of fun to listen to his Patrick's narration of who he is and what he is. Like when he's talking about his facial mask. As he begins to peel it off after 10 minutes of having it on, you really just cant help see him telling us that what is on his outside is not who he is on the inside. He's not your friend. Not your coworker. Not your lover. He's a friggin soulless killer. It is crazy to think that someone could be so cold and emotionless, but yet there are people out there that are like that. I don't believe for a second that he got 100% pleasure out of all of his kills. Some seemed like he just couldn't help it. Like we might go get a massage, have sex, or just sit on the beach for some relaxation. He would kill.<br /><br />Not only is the movie just crazy good, it's also pretty funny. Dark funny though. Seeing him get massively pissed off over someone's business cards is too funny. And not in the ha-ha kind of funny way, but in the `holy crap he's getting pissed over nothing' kind of way. And flexing in the mirror while having sex with two girls? Legendary. And chasing someone down a hallway, butt nekid except for high tops, and a chainsaw? Once again... Legendary. And when he says things out loud such as "I'm into murders and executions" and someone doesn't really hear him and thinks he says `mergers and acquisitions'...that's just funny. There are just a lot of funny lines in this movie, but dark funny guys. I love how he tells people he will kill them, but you know he means it...lol.<br /><br />Christian Bale is a pretty good actor for sure. I love how he seems different in all his parts he plays. Not a lot different, but he just is. It's almost subtle, but he's not really ever the same. But one thing for sure is that good gracious God blessed that man with a crazy metabolism or something. I'm not gay, but the man has a great body. And to do what he does with it is crazy. I'll never forget the way he looked like a dang holocaust victim in The Mechanist and then like a few months later he was Batman or something. Crazy.<br /><br />P.S. - So I'm not afraid to say I don't understand the ending. I can't tell what was going on at the end. Is he a killer for real...or is it in his head? For instance...he blew up a cop car with a pistol. Even he looked at his gun like `wtf?' And then after his confession, even his lawyer said he was kidding around. Was he? Or was the lawyer covering for him? I was confused. Anyone want to help me out? I tried not to say much, so spoilers ahead if there needs to be in the comments!</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a very successful NYC Wall-Street yuppie in the 80's, he's got a wealthy lifestyle, a great apartment, nice taste in music and a beautiful fiancee named Evelyn (Reese Weitherspoon). He seems like a perfect man for any woman but underneath that skin he is a vicious coldblooded murderer that loves taunting, raping and mutilating his victims especially keeping their bodies in the closet but how long can he bring back his sanity?<br /><br />A chilling and ultraviolent horror thriller based on a novel is quite an interesting and gory satire on yuppies in the 80's, there's quite a bit of sex such as the gorgeous Reese Weitherspoon half naked in one scene and of course graphic violence like nailgun massacres, chainsaw murders and that kind of thing. The film co-stars Jared Leto, Josh Lucas and William Defoe in fine acting roles in this picture, it's one of the best horror-thrillers of the 2000's and shouldn't be missed by any fan of the genre plus the soundtrack is great.<br /><br />This special edition DVD contains the unrated uncut version and remastered picture and sound with nifty extras like audio commentary, deleted scenes, "American Psycho: From Book to Screen" three part featurette, an Essay on the pornography of killing, TV Spots and Trailers, and "The 80's: Downtown" featurette about the 80's.<br /><br />Also recommended: "High Tension", "Maniac (1980)", "Driller Killer", "Saw Quadrilogy", "Psycho (1960)", "Psycho II", "Psycho III", "Psycho IV: The Beginning", "Hostel 1 & 2", "House of 1000 Corpses", "The Devil's Rejects", "Scarface (1983)", "The Burning", "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer", "The Untold Story", "Misery", "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series plus 2003 remake and The Beginning", "Office Space", "Vertigo", "Funny Games", "Black Christmas (1974)", "Silent Night Deadly Night", "The Shining", "Nightmare (a.k.a.

It created a sensation, and although most editorialists got it completely wrong, I do applaud them for creating a buzz around this outstanding film.  Director Mary Harron transports the viewer to Manhattan in the 1980's, impeccably re-creating the outfits, interior d&eacute;cor, snotty theme restaurants, and modern art of the time.  The main characters consist of Patrick Bateman and his fellow Wal Street merger and acquisition Vice Presidents, all of whom sit in their offices looking important and dreaming up ways to one-up the other with new business card fonts or current event tid-bits.  They date socialites who are either zonked out on drugs or working hard climbing the right social ladders.<br /><br />Patrick is, of course, an American Psycho.  He's a fastidious, narcissistic serial killer.  He doesn't limit himself to just women, but the most fantastic scenes in the movie occur when he kills beautiful model-types.  The movie has a very simple and very powerful message:  Patrick is deranged, but so is everyone around him.  Everyone is as soul-less as Patrick, and when he tries to confess his crimes, the vacuous nature of his world renders his confession unbelievable to all his friends and associates.  There is a Realtor, in fact, who proves herself to be far more deranged than Patrick, and she commits no outright crime.<br /><br />This movie is a brilliant satire of a period piece.  The gore is mainly off-screen and subtle, and the murders are almost campy (Patrick running around condo hallways naked save for sneakers and a bloody chainsaw, anyone?).</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Before he was Batman, Christian Bale turned the film world on it's ear with his incredible performance in this adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' controversial novel.  Bale stars as Wall Street yuppie Patrick Bateman, who is living the good life in the indulgent 80's.  By night, Bateman is a psychotic serial killer whose masterful routine is coming apart at the seams.  While it has uneven moments, Bale's star making performance is worth seeing American Psycho for alone.  No one else could have brought the character of Patrick Bateman to life better than Bale, and the rest of the cast, including Reese Witherspoon, Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas, Jared Leto, Willem Dafoe, Chloe Sevigny, and Samantha Mathis; are great as well as supporting characters too obsessed with themselves to realize or care as to what Patrick is doing.  A spectacular satire and a showcase for Bale's talents; American Psycho isn't quite a classic, but it's pretty close regardless.</p></br><a href="../users/A2L7WYA5OENV03.html">A2L7WYA5OENV03</a><br/><p>Unlike a lot of adaptations of novels I've seen, I have no desire to read the book.  This film's amazing.  I have no interest in influencing my views of it.  On the topic of "editions", the rated version is the one to buy.  I have the unrated one and the extra footage adds nothing.  The sex scene actually flows into the surrounding film better in the cut version.  The print they telecined to DVD also doesn't look as early a generation as the rated one, which is a little more crisp, clean, and vibrant than this one.  I remember the rated rental having very pure whites in the opening scene, and the lunch scene with Willem Defoe was more vibrant and rich looking.  There seems to be generation loss with the unrated version, or I could just be remembering it wrong. I have not seen the new Killer's collector edition, though.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S.html">A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S</a><br/><p>A lot of people didn't really know what to think about this title. The  name American Psycho made it look rather like a  slasher flick which is  what many people expected it to be. I live in Australia and the original  novel is rated R in Australia which means that anyone under 18 can't buy  the book. When I first heard that it had been made into a movie I was a bit  shocked. If a book was bad enough to earn an R rating then I was wondering  how could they go about screening it. But it turns out that they did a  rather good job. The movie still has the same story and a lot of the  bizarre sex and voilence, but it is not nearly as graphic as the book is.  This does not, however let the movie down in any way. Definatelly a worth  see and a fan of the book may be disappointed because of the lack of gore  but will still probably like it. As a DVD, it was given a fairly ordinary  treatment. Although it has stuning picture and sound quality, the extras a  fairly limited. It has the usual theatrical trailer, a five minute  interview with Christian Bale where he tells us how he became involved  in  the film and how he personally feels about the film, a very short making of  documentary that doesn't really reveal all that much, productions notes and  biographies of the cast and crew. It would have been better if it contained  a commentary track by director Mary Harron and Christian Bale, a longer  documentary and also have a section that tells us how Bret Easton Ellis  feels about the movie. Above all, it is a terrific movie that as an ok DVD  release but it required more extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CWH6VKCTJAD.html">A3CWH6VKCTJAD</a><br/><p>Not having read the book, I will take this film on its own merits.  "American Psycho" is a satirical horror film that had greater potential  than was realized.  Mary Harron's adaptation and direction seems to be the  problem.  Part of the story was a lampoon of the excessive materialism of  the 1980's, focusing particularly on the yuppie lifestyle.  That should  have served as the background for the character study.  However, Harron  pushed it to the foreground and exaggerated the portrayals of yuppie  superficiality and arrogance to the point where it became sophomoric.  She  then pounded on the point until it was threadbare.<p>The film would have  benefited from more development of Bateman's tortured inner self rather  than this obsession with his and his friends' way of life.  The story  presented an opportunity for a fresh approach to the horror genre.  Most  horror films are presented from the perspective of the victims, whereas  this story was from the killer's perspective.  In addition, since it was a  first person narrative, we had an opportunity to look inside the killer's  head.  Though some of that was done, too much of the introspection focused  on his thoughts about his lifestyle and not enough on his feelings about  the people he was killing or the acts themselves.<p>The acting by Bale was  excellent.  Though I didn't agree with Harron's vision of Bateman as the  poster child for yuppie conceit and tawdriness, Christian Bale played the  caricature to the hilt.  He was more pompous, supercilious and decadent  than your typical Roman Emperor.  The scene depicting his emotional  disintegration was terrifically done and very intense.<p>Overall, the way  the story was presented created an air of incredulity about all the  characters and their behavior which took the effectiveness out of the  psychological angle.  That left us with a mindless horror flick with only  mediocre effects.  Despite some excellent acting, I rated this film a 4/10.  A directorial hack job marred a good story concept.  Since it failed  miserably at the box office, the film's best hope is that it becomes a cult  classic in rental.  It is kitsch enough for that to be a distinct  possibility.</p></br></body></html>

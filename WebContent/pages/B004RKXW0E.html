There was no doubt whatsoever that this film would be a success as the franchise had built up quite a following. Every adults inner child would have been screaming incessantly as soon as it heard the announcement that there would be a third Toy Story. I know I was excited from the moment I saw the teaser for the film and wanted to know more and more every day as to where they would take the story next.<br /><br />Andy (John Morris) is now 17 years old and preparing to go to college. Almost all Andy's old toys have already been either thrown away in the trash or donated, all the toys that are left are Buzz (Tim Allen), Woody (Tom Hanks), Jessie (Joan Cusack), Bullseye, Slinky Dog (Blake Clark), Mr & Mrs. Potato Head (Don Rickles & Estelle Harris), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Rex (Wallace Shawn) and the Green Aliens (Jeff Pidgeon). They are worried about what will happen to them when Andy goes to college, will they be thrown in the trash, left in the attic or will Andy take them with him. The third option being the most unlikely. When Andy is packing his stuff, the toys find themselves ending up in Sunnyside day care centre, which seems like heaven to them all. Run by Lotso (Ned Beaty), what seems to be a heaven for toys turns out to be somewhat of a hell for the old gang and they have to find a way back home before Andy goes to college.<br /><br />I'm a massive fan of the original movies as these are something I've literally grown up with. The bits of adult type humour I didn't really get when I watched the films when I was younger, I enjoy watching again and getting new and more fruitful laughs. Toy Story 2 was shown on TV a few weeks ago and it was a genuine pleasure to watch something I had not watched for a number of years and still managing to be able to enjoy the humour and the message to pass onto the kids about friendship and loyalty. The message was strong then, and it's good to know that the message hasn't been lost in the 11 year gap leading to Toy Story 3, and is actually even stronger. The characters that were left are tied together, stronger than ever by the fact that it's only them left and they do not want to be split up, but in fact if they can't stay with Andy, they want a new home where they will be played with every day.<br /><br />The animation has seen a significant upgrade in almost every department. Lee Unkrich has commented that when approaching the animation for this movie, the makers have not approached it in the mind that it must look the same as the last two instalments. They animators approached it with the mind of making Toy Story 3 look how they would have wanted the originals to look, had the technology been as advanced as it is now. There's definitely an upgrade in look and feel of the characters and the atmosphere of the whole thing, especially with the human characters as it makes their story a lot more believable, and allows the viewer to invest more emotion into the story.<br /><br />The characters both new and old are excellent and create some hilarious moments. Possibly the best addition to the Toy Story cast was Barbie's male counterpart, Ken who's as camp and image obsessed as you would possibly imagine him to be. Lotso, the villain of the film was quite the typical villain you would expect. A mob boss of sorts in the setting of the day care centre, he's a toy that was lost and replaced as a youngster who feels bitter and angry towards the humans and the toys that play with them. Although I understood why Lotso was the character he was, I never really understood why he was so hell bent on keeping the toys locked up in the day care centre. Perhaps that was just a negative symptom of me not paying much attention to that part of the story.<br /><br />Overall, however, the film was truly splendid from start to finish. The characters were both as enjoyable and lovable as I remember them and it contained some truly hearty laughs, my personal favourite was the Spanish Buzz Lightyear trying to win Jessie's heart. I would highly recommend this to anyone still in touch with their inner child, or someone looking to introduce these characters to a new generation as it's promising entertainment for the entire family.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>So, I probably know this movie better than the people there at Pixar (the curse of having a `Toy Story' obsessed 3-Year-Old) and I still think it's one of the best films of the year, easy (the BEST next to `The Social Network').  Why?  Well, for one it is beautifully constructed to excite and entertain.  It is a lovable piece of animated heaven.  On top of the obvious though, there is warmth presented within the films surprisingly deep themes that make this stand out as heartfelt and honest.  When you watch this beautiful movie you cannot help but become a part of the story.<br /><br />It's hard to come off of the success of films as wildly lauded as the first two installments in the pitch perfect trilogy, but somehow the folks there at Pixar made good on their promise and saved the best for last.<br /><br />Seriously, it's THAT good.<br /><br />The film follows the adventures of your favorite toys, Woody the Cowboy, Buzz Lightyear, Jessie the Cowgirl, Bullseye, Slinky-Dog, Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Rex and the rest of their friends (which has been dwindled down to a select few over the years.  Years have passed since we last saw them and Andy, their owner, is now full grown and on his way to college.  The toys are devastated at the prospect of being thrown away, never to be played with again.  When an unfortunate accident lands the toys on the curb they take immediate action and donate themselves to Sunnyside Daycare, a seemingly magical place where toys can enjoy love and affection from kids forever and ever.<br /><br />Nothing is as it seems though.<br /><br />Yes, this film is funny, but it doesn't end there.  This film is also devastatingly sincere.  While no one watching this film is a `toy' the feelings and emotions presented by the toys themselves is so earnest and believable that one cannot help but find a piece of themselves within these lost souls.  The foreknowledge that you have been outgrown is a powerful message about growing up and moving on, about losing the ones we love whether it is by our own hands or by events out of our control.  Relationships in general are outgrown, and this film tackles that understanding with a depth not often attributed to animated films (I love Pixar for making SMART animated films).  What is even more powerful is the loss of innocence that is broached in the final frames, with Andy and his toys and their eventuality.  It is a beautiful and moving statement about leaving childish things behind but never forgetting the beauty that abounds within them.<br /><br />Yes, I was bawling at the end of this film.<br /><br />I will throw a mild disclaimer out there in regards to your kids and this movie.  The film is a tad scarier than the other two in the trilogy.  In fact, my daughter was petrified of Lotso-Huggin'-Bear the first time she saw this film.  He is VERY mean hearted and the way that the film is shot and his sequences done (with dramatic lighting and music) can be overwhelming for some children (there were multiple screams in the theaters).  That said, when all was said and done my daughter loved the film and actually saw it three times in the theater and we have it on pre-order, so you be the judge.  I just thought I should put that out there.<br /><br />In the end, this was one of the more rewarding experiences I had in the theater this year, maybe even this decade.  It was everything I wanted it to be and more; much, much more!</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>"Toy Story", the film that would earn animation company Pixar Animation Studios the reputation of being the finest animation studio in the world and would literally bring Walt Disney Studios to enter new generation of animated films created entirely in CGI but also would earn the love and praise not only from the critics but the fans who wanted more and more.<br /><br />Released in 1995 and budgeted at $30 million, the first film would go on to make $351 million worldwide (and still making money with the recent Blu-ray release).<br /><br />In November 1999, the sequel "Toy Story 2" was released in theaters and the $90 million dollar film like its predecessor did extremely well in the domestic and worldwide box office making over $485 million.<br /><br />But it has been more than a decade since the release of a "Toy Story" film and 15 years since the first film, fans have been clamoring for a new "Toy Story" film and sure enough, Disney/Pixar released the third and final film of the trilogy, "Toy Story 3" in June 2010 and not only did it surpass the box office returns of the first two films combined, earning over 1 billion dollars, the second Disney film to earn over a billion after "Alice in Wonderland" (also released in 2010).<br /><br />"Toy Story 3" literally shattered box office records and became the 5th highest grossing film of all time worldwide and the 9th highest grossing film in the US (and obviously the highest grossing film of 2010) and is an ultimate success for Disney/Pixar.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />When I watched "Toy Story 1" and "Toy Story 2", I easily noticed how CGI had improved between 1995 and 1999, especially with how fabric started to show more detail and we started to see more of a surface to Mr. Potato Head and T-Rex.<br /><br />But "Toy Story 3", eleven years later, you would expect CGI to take a dramatic leap forward and needless to say, "Toy Story 3" is visually impressive.<br /><br />Presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio), the first thing you notice with "Toy Story 3" are the vibrant colors and then overall detail.  Everything shows detail and as we learn from this Blu-ray release, the animators wanted to make sure that the characters themselves do not look like toys, that they wanted to make sure the characters and toys are distinguished and the animators succeeded in every way possible.<br /><br />Mr. Potato Head, you literally see the surface like the actual toy, down to its seams.  Look at the hardwood floors in Andy's room, so much detail on the floor that it looks realistic, even some outdoor scenes look photorealistic (especially the animation and CG shown during Lotso's past, wow!).  And the fabric of the clothing, you can see the threading, the weaves and how much detail went into the clothing. One scene with the monkey, it looks like a stuffed monkey with its detail, the detail of it's clothing and scary eyes, these models look fantastic!  Also, see the dirt and grime on the animals, that was awesome how they captured that in the film.<br /><br />The hair even was well-done, the wear and tear that the toys go through at Sunnyside Daycare is evident through the nicks and scratches and also looking at Andy's trunk and seeing the little chips on the trunk to the paint and we can see the brush strokes on the walls, "Toy Story 3" just looks magnificent on Blu-ray and I don't see how any videophile can say anything negative about how this film looks on Blu-ray.<br /><br />And facial expressions of the human characters such as Andy, his sister, his mother to Bonnie, these were well-animated and rendered.<br /><br />I did notice some banding but times I did see it were short.  For example, when Woody is back at Sunnyside, he is holding the red phone receiver and the banding is evident in that one scene but again, the scenes you do see it are seconds long and does not distract you from how fantastic this film looks.<br /><br />This is the best looking Disney/Pixar film to date!  Vibrant, detailed and everything about the picture quality is going to make videophiles swoon!  It's that impressive and easily a reference quality Blu-ray release for picture quality!<br /><br />As for the accompanying DVD, the DVD is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1).<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />"Toy Story 3 " is presented in English 7.1 DTS Master Audio and English 5.1 DTS Master Audio.  Also, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital EX is included as well as English 2.0 DVS.<br /><br />All I can say is that "Toy Story 3' sounds magnificent.  The first action scenes that startoff the film will show you how awesome this film sounds in lossless.  From Mrs. Potato Head's voice coming from the surround channels, sounds coming from the rear surround channels, LFE being utilized for the evil Dr. Porkchop's laser beam or when Mr. Potato Head has Slinky Dog turn on its force field and Jesse calling on T-Rex, this is just impressive to hear the sound coming from all channels.<br /><br />Dialogue is crystal clear and music is just as clear!  And you then hear how the sound is utilized during the children's rush to get the toys as they slam them all over the place, the garbage dump as everything is being compacted and you can hear flames pattering, the garbage truck coming from the distance, tiny footstep sounds throughout the room... really, there are so many sounds that are well-utilized throughout this film, it's very impressive!  Sure, the film is not 100% action-based but action and non-action scenes, the film sounds fantastic on Blu-ray and I didn't even notice a lot of these sounds at the theater when I watched this film this past summer.<br /><br />So, you really experience a  great, immersive soundscape with "Toy Story 3' from all channels, especially via LFE. Not only is picture quality hitting the high marks for reference quality, the lossless audio is just as magnificent and audiophiles should be happy with this Blu-ray release as well!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.  For the special features, some extras have other subtitles included.<br /><br />As for the accompanying DVD, the DVD is presented in English 5.1 Dolby Digital EX and 2.0 DVS.

The digital copy of the feature film works with iTunes and Windows Media Player.  Also, a slip over cover comes with this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I'm sure that "Toy Story 3" hit people a lot harder emotionally than some viewers.  Some look at it as the next level of wonderful CGI graphics for Disney/Pixar animated films, others look at the film as another successful film for the studio but I'm going to go even farther and say that this film caught my attention, not because I grew up with the previous two films but the fact is that like the character of Andy, during my late teens, it was time to say goodbye to all the toys that I once owned.<br /><br />Memories of having friends overnight to play with these toys, memories of opening the old department store catalogs and hoping my grandparents would get me the latest toy that I picked out and then to open it in Christmas morning.  Suffice to say, when it came to my toys... I was very fortunate to have such a memorable time playing with them and having caring family to help support that habit.  But unlike Andy, I did not have the moment to say goodbye, it was more like, turn 16 and my parents made the conscious decision to throw out all my toys and force me to sell all my comic books and prepare for graduation and SAT tests and so forth.<br /><br />Needless to say, it was not necessarily a traumatic moment but it was a defining moment...OK, who am I kidding, it was one of the saddest moments in my life.<br /><br />So, "Toy Story 3" for me, was just a magnificent film that took me back to those old days of playing in my room and like Andy, having these wild adventures that I could conjure in my head and sooner or later, we grow older, become interested in different things and sooner or later, we say goodbye and prepare for our next stage in our lives as young adults.<br /><br />I watched this film knowing that it was going to be successful and along with my wife, my son and my nephew, watched it in 3D the first day it came to theater.  But watching it on Blu-ray, without the usual audience distractions, my experience this time around was heightened.  Watching "Toy Story 3" in 1080p, I was amazed by how vibrant the film looked, how much detail was showcased.  From the little tears in Andy's toy chest, the clothing of the characters, the dirt and grime on the toys, the wonderful lossless audio and then for me to watch the special features in three days because there are a good number of them included, I can't help but feel that this is truly a perfect release.<br /><br />Yes, I am sure the videophiles will say there was banding on the picture quality but those banding moments were few and were short.  Really, everything you love about the film, you get that and more in the "Toy Story 3: 4-Disc Combo Pack". It's important for people to know that if you don't need the accompanying DVD or the digital copy, you can also purchase the Blu-ray two-disc version as well.<br /><br />Personally, I can't find one significant flaw with this Blu-ray release.  There is something for everyone in this release, may you be a fan of the film, a person wanting to learn about the animation business and learn from the awesome team at Pixar, there is just so much to love about this release that it's definitely one of the top 10 Blu-ray releases of 2010 and that is pretty tough as this year alone had many significant releases, especially coming from Disney.  If anything, Walt Disney continues to raise the bar for its Blu-ray releases and I suppose since this is finale farewell for the "Toy Story" series (which I would imagine is not set in stone because "Toy Story" made an insane amount of money for Disney and "Toy Story 3" made over a billion dollars worldwide, I just can't see this being a 100% final farewell), they had to go out with a bang for this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Overall, "Toy Story 3" is a film in which Pixar continues to their reign of innovation, their mark on quality of beautifully animated films and a well-written storyline that just pulls you in.  The Blu-ray release is not just for those who love "Toy Story 3" but for those who loved the "Toy Story" trilogy.  If you loved the first two films, then this is a no-brainer, this is a must-buy release.<br /><br />"Toy Story 3: 4-Disc Combo Pack" is magnificent and is a true 5-star release!  Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>TOY STORY 3 is the perfect bow completing the Toy Story package.  My mother, 13 year old daughter, 5 year old daughter and I all loved every minute of it.  TOY STORY 3 made all three generations of my family laugh, cry, and cheer.  Yes, the story is basically the same story told in the other two movies - the toys have to get back to Andy - but we certainly didn't care.  Disney has pulled off a perfect hat trick, a golden triple crown with the Toy Story trio, and they are all endearing family movies.  And it is possible that TOY STORY 3 is the best of them all.<br /><br />TOY STORY 3 is clearly meant to be the end of the Toy Story saga:  Andy is going off to college (really?  It seems that just yesterday he was 6 years old and getting a Buzz Lightyear doll...where does the time go???).  Andy must decide what to do with his favorite toys; he hasn't played with them in years, but they are still his favorites and have sentimental value.  What should he do with them?  Through an unfortunate but completely plausible mistake, the toys end up donated to a preschool.  Although most of the toys believe Andy sent them there on purpose, Woody is ever loyal, and knows that this is not the case.  He finally convinces the others of their error, and now, of course, the toys must get back to Andy before he leaves for college.  Will they ever get home?  Will they get there safely?  Will they make it before Andy leaves?  What will become of them?<br /><br />TOY STORY 3 is delightful entertainment for the entire family.  Disney does many things right, but their stories with the message of being true to yourself and true to your friends are always outstanding.  These messages are so important for young kids, and Disney tells them well and memorably, in many forms.  And TOY STORY 3 is one of their best.<br /><br />With outstanding vocal talent, including the return of Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, young and old alike will are sure to enjoy this adorable, sentimental, and funny flim.  The story is typical happy ending Disney, the animation is excellent, the 3-D effects are great, and the messages are perfect.  Added to that are some wonderful gags that will leave you laughing until you cry.  Look for guest appearances from many toys from your childhood; they will bring back many happy memories and lots of giggles.  Especially endearing was the return of Barbie, who at long last met her Ken.  Their interaction, as well as Barbie's stunning declaration that "Authority should derive from the consent of the governed, not from the threat of force!" (she really has brains under all that blond hair!), is hysterical and memorable.<br /><br />Take lots of tissues to TOY STORY 3, especially if you have a child who has left for college.  Andy makes a beautiful decision in the end, and clearly, all the toys we have come to love will live happily ever after.  Well done, Disney.  The entire TOY STORY trilogy is a true classic, one that will be loved by generations to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I know that title will stir up some controversy, but I can not think of a more consistent trilogy that has gotten better with each installment with the third film being the best of all! Pixar has done it again and is really starting to show up the competition with their latest classic animated tale Toy Story 3. What a track record!, Have these guys ever bombed? .....OK Andrew let's just leave Cars out of this! ;-D ....it's not that bad, just not as good as their greatest works.<br /><br />Pixar's Toy Story 3 is really a beautiful film to behold, both visually and metaphorically. I've shed more tears watching their animated films than most live action films combined in recent years. I guess the original Toy Story being somewhat crude by today's animation standards only had one way to go, up! That doesn't mean it was an easy task, but it is the one that started it all and put Pixar on the map. To improve on the original in the sequels, things like expectations and topping what they did last time have to be carefully balanced and of course the story must include a believable growth of the characters.<br /><br />It is all these areas that Toy Story 3 succeeds with flying colors! It's an incredible film that is both funny and heartfelt. One of the great things about this series is the nostalgic aspect, remembering all those cool toys and the in jokes that only adults will get. I do think this film is rather intense for younger kids at times, but most of the great one are. These films are really made with adults in mind which in nothing new to animation. Disney classic and Bugs Bunny cartoons where always constructed for adults as most kids wouldn't get half the jokes in them anyway.<br /><br />This is something for parents to consider before they let their kids see this or any other film like it. I know I grew up watching Pinocchio and Bambi and I never felt traumatized by them and they are some of the most frightening animated films out there....the same could be said about Finding Nemo which has some very scary scenes in it.<br /><br />Since parents tend to shield children from this stuff nowadays, well........ the choice it yours, but I don't think shielding them from this stuff is protecting them....that doesn't mean any of this stuff is meant for 3 year olds. The same case can be made for PC versions of these and other cartoons. I think having open discussions with children rather than hiding life's negatives is a much better solution.<br /><br />The four disc edition is loaded with interesting goodies and of course the film is included  in formats Blu Ray, DVD and Digital copy, which all look exceptional.</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>As usual the quality of production is outstanding; the audio and video is completely satisfying.<br /><br />The story continues as Andy gets ready to leave for college; the big question for the toys is what will happen to them. The development of this theme provides the story line for the movie.<br /><br />There are many adventures and misadventures as the future for Andy's toys is played out; new characters are introduced along with some seriously threatening situations for the toys. The drama of some of these threats can produce concern for some children; this has a number of sections that place the toys in great peril.<br /><br />The intensity of these threats may be upsetting to some children; it may be well to rent this one before you buy if your main audience is children.<br /><br />From a collectors viewpoint, this is a must have film; this appears to wrap up this phase of the toys lives leaving the toys in a peaceful, happy situation. So the end does bring resolution for the toys but only after some fairly big time adventures.<br /><br />I'm delighted to have it as an addition to my collection!</p></br><a href="../users/A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7.html">A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7</a><br/><p>Anyone except a flexible rubber, hard plastic or plush toy without a heart should find themselves in tears more than once in this movie about just those kinds of toys who, after being outgrown for years by their owner, now face the prospect of that boy, Andy, going off to college and leaving them behind forever. As usual the Pixar animation is fabulous, the voice talent -- Tom Hanks, Wallace Shawn and others -- capture the, yes, hearts of the toys brilliantly, and there is at least as much fun for adults as for children.  In fact, for kids younger than five or so, some of the scenes will be very, very intense.  There are many wonderful lines, including "we do a lot of improv around here," and Ken telling the other toys at the pre-school that "I am not a girl's toy."  His fashion show for Barbie is a highlight.  Life for the toys in the Caterpillar Room of the pre-school captures exactly how it is to live with a two year old and the final scene does the same with the bittersweet moments of moving on.</p></br><a href="../users/ASEBX8TBYWQWA.html">ASEBX8TBYWQWA</a><br/><p>Okay, so there are well over 150 reviews of the film posted already, so I don't need to go into details of the plot again. I was probably one of the few who did not see the film when it was released in theaters and so the DVD (not the Blu-ray) was my first chance to see it.<br /><br />While the name Disney is synonymous with  "Kid's movie", this one - like Up really hits the mark with adults - especially "baby boomers". Why? For a few reasons:<br /><br />1. The toys themselves are "baby boomer" icons: Mr. (and Mrs.) Potato Head, Slinky, Barbie and Ken and the very sly - and somewhat crude - reference to Lincoln Logs)<br /><br />2. There are way too many scary scenes - the final incinerator one, most of all - that look too realistic and will certainly scare children under 6 or 7.<br /><br />3. The script is written so to not bore the older viewers, but there are sections which little ones will find boring. And the viewer has to really understand the relationship of Barbie and Ken to get the many scenes they have. (And they are fun!)<br /><br />4. The Pixar detail is so wonderful and detailed - again the detail in the incinerator belt - that adults will be more impressed than children.<br /><br />5. Finally it'll be the adults who will relate to Andy having to leave his "pals" and will shed a tear at the end. (I certainly did).<br /><br />The bonus features on the DVD will also appeal to adults more than kids. The making of film, the short Pixar films and the brief "Buzz Lightyear" short made for NASA will be lost on any kids under 10.<br /><br />So, I'm here to rave about the film and encourage adults to buy this for themselves - even if they don't have children. Many of us grew up with these toys and they were our "friends". There's some nostalgia here as well as a great script, superb graphics (I watched on a standard def TV and it was still very sharp) and even some REALLY thrilling moments. Like Up, this will certainly make my Top Ten list this year!<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />"Anything Phonographic"</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>I must be getting more emotional as I slowly close-in on forty. It used to be that I never cried at movies or books. I still remember the first book I cried at the end of (Magic's Price by Mercedes Lackey, the book series that also helped me come out), and that was when I was 19. I was twenty-five before I cried at my first movie (Titanic). It wasn't until three years later when I saw A.I. - Artificial Intelligence that I did it again. So I'm not overly sentimental, as you may have gathered from this and most of my blog.<br /><br />But lately I've been crying like a baby at a bunch of different movies. Everything from The Red Balloon, to Up, to Where the Wild Things Are, getting me to cry at a movie is getting easier and easier. Maybe they're just shamelessly manipulative, or maybe I'm starting menopause.<br /><br />To that list of films that had me all weepy we can now add Toy Story 3. I'm not a long-term fan of the Toy Story franchise. I only saw the first and second one a few weeks ago when Amazon had blu-ray versions on sale for $30 if you bought both. I saw them and liked them, so I was looking forward to this newest version.<br /><br />Our film opens with Andy, the boy who owns the toys, getting ready to head to college. He's seventeen and hasn't played with his toys in years. These days Woody, Buzz and the rest spend most of their time sitting around in the toy box inventing new ways to get Andy to come open it and peer inside. This does not make for a happy set of toys.<br /><br />Eventually the day comes when Andy is packing up to go. He plans to take Woody with him to school and put the other toys in the attic, but due to some confusion on his mother's part all the toys end up out on the curb ready to get picked up by the garbage men. Woody, seeing this, rushes down to help and through a series of unfortunate incidents the toys then end up at a daycare center.<br /><br />Life there seems to be ideal, especially for Barbie once she meets Ken, but Woody's main concern is getting back home to Andy. He tries to rally the other toys, but no one wants to come along. Eventually he leaves as the toys that remain learn that paradise isn't what it seems to be.<br /><br />There's plenty of action and peril in this movie, a bit more so than in the others. In addition to a menacing purple teddy-bear and his creepy baby-doll henchman, there's also many sharp blades, a grinder, flames, and, perhaps most dangerous of all, toddlers. The resolutions to the various bits of peril were entertaining and satisfying, including one resolution that I'll describe as machina ex machina.<br /><br />The film isn't perfect (I could really do without Randy Newman's music. Ever), but I really enjoyed it, and the final scene is fitting, moving and deeply wonderful. This is one of the few movies I've seen this year that I actively look forward to seeing again, and while that's not saying much given that this summer has included films like Grown Ups, it is nevertheless a great recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/AHBNPMHDWZ7SB.html">AHBNPMHDWZ7SB</a><br/><p>The absolute best animation I have ever seen. How fitting, considering Toy Story was the pioneer of digital animation. I was four when the first Toy Story came out, and eight when the second one did. I pretty much grew up on Disney movies, Toy Story and Lion King being the two I watched most. Probably a few hundred times between the two of them (no exaggeration). I literally grew up with Woody, Buzz and the gang. Coincidentally, I started my first year of college last year, so Andy and I share a connection that is very personal to me. The people over at Pixar have done what has only happened a few times in history. Let's hope they take home the Oscar for Best Picture like the Lord of the Rings did, although I wouldn't get my hopes up. Those Academy douche bags... But back to Pixar. They created a damn near perfect trilogy. I loved this movie. This may be blasphemy to some of you, but I have to admit that Shrek 2 still holds the crown as my all time favorite animated film. After that is How To Train Your Dragon, then probably Toy Story 3 and Toy Story 2 tied at third. Ratatouille is tied with Monster's Inc. for a very close fourth. As you can see, Pixar dominates my list, that does go on, by the way. Anyway, I think this was a perfect way to close the trilogy. The last fifteen minutes or so were very heartfelt and touching. I was on the verge of tears. When Woody said goodbye to Andy in the closing moments, I felt as if he was talking directly to me. The movie is altogether excellent.<br /><br />I have to admit that I was a bit nervous that it wouldn't impress me as much as everyone said it would. After reading over a dozen reviews with perfect scores, I had expectations that almost always lead to disappoint. I'm happy to say I was not. Not even close. The script is very well done. The music is just as great. The voice acting never felt insincere. And most importantly, I never got the feeling that some studio executive told the geniuses at Pixar to make this movie because it would clean out the pockets of millions of moviegoers I'm talking to you DreamWorks. I almost hated Shrek after the third movie, then they did a fourth?! No, I never got that feeling from this movie at all. It was a rejuvenation to a property that was already loved by almost everyone. The graphical detail in the picture was incredible. It saddens me to know that their adventures are over, but I'm glad it ended the way it did. Waiting eleven years to do the final entry was probably not intentional, but it worked out for the best. At least for me because of my age corresponding to Andy's. I'm really going to miss those toys. "How is the BD transfer," one might ask. Simply put, it's "Pixar Perfect". Toy Story 3 comes with one of the best Disney/Pixar slipcovers available. Beautiful embossing, and the color scheme fits the film perfectly. As for the extra content, there is plenty. There is an audio commentary, and a Picture-in-Picture commentary, an abundance of featurettes, and the short that played prior to the film when it was in theatres ("Day & Night"). There are also your standard Pixar extras, like the the self-calibration and other publicity featurettes. All around, the extras are very good.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>Pixar which raised the bar for animation in 1995 with the original "Toy Story", closes the chapter (I think) with this even better 3rd film.  Andy, now 17 and headed to college, must decide what to do with all his toys.  Through human error, most end up on the curb, rescued and sent to day care.  Unfortunately, they are placed with toddlers who are not "age appropriate" playmates for our guys.  Woody, who had been chosen to go with Andy to college, must make numerous moral choices beginning with rescuing his friends.  The Pixar team as you might expect deliver a technological achievement, but pack the film with action, thrills and humor as well.  Expect to swallow hard and whisk away a tear or two as Andy says his final goodbyes to Woody, Buzz and the rest of the gang...and to us as well I guess.</p></br><a href="../users/A25KKXUQQ0OLWB.html">A25KKXUQQ0OLWB</a><br/><p>I had never seen any of the Toy Story movies when I was asked to go to this one.  The kids were really young in that movie theatre but they barely made a movie and were quiet all the way through.  So was I!  Toy Story 3 was far better than most movies in 2010 and I suspect the best one.  Woody, Buzz and the friends are left in a toy chest now and with Andy going to college, mom is all gung ho in cleaning out his room before he goes.  The toys have to be carted up to the attic or thrown out.  That's it.  Andy puts the toys in a garbage bag and leaves it to go up into the attic but mom thinks they are meant for the junkyard and puts them out for the trash!  The toys manage to get themselves to a daycare center but it turns out to be a living hell.  A stuffed bear named Lots-O rules the roost with cruelty and the toys need to get out before they are broken by unruly young children.  Woody has been chosen to go to college with Andy but tries to save his friends.  Adventure ensues.  What is so impressive is how complex the story is and how well developed the movie is made.  Adult movies are usually more childish these days and contain less complex dialog.  Toy Story 3 doesn't insult children or adults and entertains all.  This movie is truly for all ages and meant for enjoyment of all.  Wonderful film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>Toy Story 3 (Four-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy) is the third movie in the Toy Story series and an amazing sequel. Andy is going to college and the toys (except Woody) are supposed to be put in the attic. But a mix up ensues and the adventure begins. The animation is superb and I love the music in the movie. At the end of the movie you can not wait till the next Toy Story movie comes out. I am very much hoping for a fourth, and a fifth movie. I loved it.

Toy Story has been with us for 15 years now (20, in terms of actual development) and I had a sinking feeling that maybe all the character potential had been used in the first two and this was some shameless plot by Disney to exploit the franchise ("Little Mermaid 3", anyone?). Well, shame on me for underestimating the capabilities of Pixar, who once again have shown how a small studio in Emeryville is a storytelling powerhouse that leaves the rest of the industry in the dust.<br /><br />Toy Story 3 is the tale of Andy, the toys' owner, going to college and their quest to determine their future - headed between the attic or a daycare center. If you've enjoyed the way the first two films blend character drama with innovative action and humor, this cocktail hits its stride in the third film, which draws on everything we already know about the characters and then adds two new entire sets of toys to the plot. There's a new villain, two very amusing romance sub-plots and a litany of visual gags that push the envelope even further. I'm not allowed to go into any details but the second half of the film is a familiar set piece performed in a completely new way that will forever change your view of certain toys and day care centers.<br /><br />Apart from a level of animation that sets the bar in the industry and an attention to detail that makes you wonder what most "real" films actually do in pre-production, the real genius of the third film is to provide a satisfying conclusion that gives every character a completed character arc. About 20 minutes before the end, I was wondering how they would do this since there were some fairly dark moments (similar to those in Wall-E and Up), but naturally they manage to pull it together. There's literally not a single wasted shot, let alone a wasted scene, and the pace quickens throughout to keep the tension mounting.<br /><br />Overall, this is another Pixar classic that easily has enough for both kids and adults (and movie aficionados). It's not difficult to see why each of their movies takes five years to complete - yet despite the technical wizardry, the success of their movies is fundamentally routed in their stories, a fact which most other studios seem to forget these days. As to whether the stage is set for Toy Story 4, I suppose they could always pull it off given the creativity at work here, but I think there was a deliberate attempt to make this the last in the series.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>"Toy Story" was about sibling rivalry. "Toy Story 2" was about loving others, even if it means you might get hurt someday.<br /><br />So what is "Toy Story 3" about? It takes the whole "kids + loyal toys" theme to its natural conclusion, by showing us what happens when the kids grow up and leave. While the first two-thirds of the movie are fairly pedestrian (for a Pixar movie!), the last part is both action-packed and emotionally wrenching.<br /><br />Ten years have passed, and Andy is now a college-bound teenager. His toys are anxious about what's going to happen, so Woody keeps assuring them that they'll be put safely in the attic. But a misunderstanding leads to a date with the garbage truck. Since the toys believe they have been abandoned, they jump into the box of donated toys bound for Sunnyside Daycare.<br /><br />They're greeted by the genial Lots-o'-Hugging Bear (aka Lotso) and the friendly daycare toys, and all seems to be well. But Andy's toys soon discover that Sunnyside is a nighmare -- they've been assigned the "Caterpillar Room" for wild abusive toddlers, and Lotso is the Godfatheresque overlord of the daycare. Once Woody learns the true horrors of Sunnyside, he must infiltrate the daycare and somehow get his friends out.<br /><br />You know that the movie industry is officially in a slump when the cleverest, funniest and most touching movie of the summer... is a CGI sequel about toys. "Toy Story 3" starts off rather lightweight at first, with the toys being brought into Sunnyside and Woody setting off in another direction.<br /><br />But once Lotso is revealed as the villain, the movie takes a sharp turn -- it becomes a clever, complex "Great Escape"-style caper, with some moments of G-rated horror (THE MONKEY!) and hilarity (resetting Buzz ends up turning him into a flamenco-dancing suave Spaniard). And while the toys' attempted escape from Sunnyside is taut and genuinely thrilling, it's only the START of the climax -- a harrowing, genuinely scary chase scene that brings the toys together.<br /><br />And there's a bittersweet core to "Toy Story 3": kids grow up, leave home and the people/toys they leave behind are both proud and sad. In the final scenes of the movie,we're quietly ushered through the emotional goodbyes and hellos of growing up.<br /><br />And the adorable little cast of toys still remind us that what matters most is love and loyalty, particularly during a deadly crisis where they all fearfully join hands (it sounds sappy, but it isn't). There's also some endearing additions to the cast -- the foppish clotheshorse Ken, Big Baby, a Totoro, a giggly tricerotops, and the Shakespearean stuffed hedgehog Mr. Pricklepants.<br /><br />Anyway, this blu-ray/DVD combo has a wealth of extras -- trailers teasers, theatrical shorts (oh look, Night and Day are scuffling!), "Cine-emplore," commentary, lots of making-ofs, behind the scenes stuff like "A Toy's Eye View: Creating A Whole New Land," a music video, and just lots of endearing odds and ends like Ken's dating tips. Er...<br /><br />It hurts to say goodbye to Woody, Buzz and their friends, but "Toy Story 3" is a fitting farewell that brings the trilogy full circle. Best movie of the summer, hands down.</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>I tried to convince my wife to be the one to take my kids to Toy Story 3.  My youngest son, especially, was begging to go, but while I was impressed by the first two, a long ways back, and saw them as showcases for the increasingly sophisticated animation techniques at Pixar, I didn't really love either one of them as much as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007LVCM">A Bug's Life</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JN4W">The Incredibles</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EOQWEO">Wall-E</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VBJEEG">Ratatouille</a>.  Perhaps it's just the devoted toy concept that didn't quite move me.  I'm not quite sure why, but for whatever reason, I went into this unenthusiastic and only doing it for the kids.<br /><br />As it turns out, I really liked it.  As far as I'm concerned right now it's the best of the series - of course, now I'd actually be willing to go back and sit through the others and maybe find I liked them too.  It's clever and inventive, with sight gags and visual puns that are underplayed, almost in passing. Its big, blockbuster animation, but the humor manages to be subtle, rather than in your face like so much popular animation these days.  While, like the other films and like everything Pixar, it's not afraid to wear its heart on its sleeve it's never sappy, and the storytelling earns its sentimental payoff rather than wrenching it from you.  I never felt manipulated.  The look is nothing short of astonishing.  The visuals are intricate and full of rich details, but it never feels busy or crowded.  I'd like to see it again just so now I can pay more attention to the details now I know what's happening.  The opening reminded me a bit of the surreal and (even more) hilarious stop motion toy fantasy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003H0ZHGM">A Town Called Panic</a> (also highly recommended), but the rest fit nicely into the general pattern of the series without feeling like one of the generic and uninspiring sequels that are so common these days.<br /><br />The basic story should be familiar: Woody and Buzz and their buddies are facing a new abandonment crisis.  This time, it's because Andy is going to college, and they fear he will leave them behind in storage, or worse, throw them away.  What is surprising is how fresh they manage to make it all feel.  Nothing was predictable or generic, and I was sad to see it end.  Perhaps best of all, though, was the amazing short film "Night and Day" with which it began.  It's better not to say anything about that, since it's best just to see it unawares.  Still it's a magical film, one of the most exciting and intriguing animated shorts I'd ever seen.  A perfect beginning for an inventive and moving film.  Not to be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A27P0MW8TE1JQP.html">A27P0MW8TE1JQP</a><br/><p>First let me say: Toy Story 3 is another Pixar masterpiece and the perfect way to close a franchise started in 1995. Randy Newman's "You've got a friend in me" warms the heart today as it first did 15 years ago.<br /><br />Now with that out of the way let me call attention to the films lead-in...<br /><br /> Pixar continues another tradition here with is the animated short that precedes the feature (like Luxo Jr. where the Studio's logo comes from). Toy Story 3's short is called "Day & Night" and raises the bar for future Pixar shorts and will likely get many Academy nomination for it's efforts.  I think the 3-D may work more effectively with the short than the sequel itself. "Day & Night" is more complicated a concept than you'd expect considering it involves two mute characters struggling to coexist. One character consists, literally of daytime images while his counterpart is made of night images.  Although the two characters are little more than retro-cartoon silhouettes, they are filled with complex animated scenes within their own animation. They shift positions and move around one another creating some fascinating visuals for us. Equally simple is it's message for  folks to overcome their fear of the  differences in others and the unknown. Day & Night is simply the best short I've seen from Pixar to date<br /><br />Now with that out of the way, Toy Story 3 reunites us with old friends: Woody, Buzz, Jesse, Hamm, Rex, Mr. & Mrs. Potato Head, each voiced by their original actors (except the late Jim Varney). Surprisingly, the Toys owner Andy, now grown up and ready to start college is still voiced by the same actor John Morris (who started at around 11 in the first film).  It seems the concept of toys coming to life when people aren't look would become tired after 2 films, but I have to say that is not the case here. After a super opening sequence, an homage to Woody's opening adventure in the original film, the toys end up at Daycare run like a prison by a naughty Teddy Bear (voiced by Ned Beatty). Naturally the Toys want to escape; the break-out plan doesn't go quite as planned by makes for some funny tributes to the prison movie genre (including a harmonica playin' Hamm). More classic toys turn up like the old Fisher-Price rolling phone and cymbal-monkey as an ever watchful prison guard. Barbie's Ken even turns up voiced gloriously campy by Michael Keaton, definitely emerging as the film's breakout toy characterization. The visuals are more amazing than ever, the humans look so much better than the original, it may become difficult to watch those older sequences after seeing "3."  Lot's of details sweep across the screen with everything from the Pizza Planet " Yo" truck, to all the texture of Ken's extensively stocked accessory  collection (Groovy).  But technical strides aside, on an emotional level the movie, like those before it, generate plenty of concern for the wellbeing of these CGI toys, again. I would go as far to say if you are not touched by the final moments of the film and Andy's goodbye, then you may want to get to a cardiologist and get yourself checked out!</p></br><a href="../users/A24IJY3V0804WJ.html">A24IJY3V0804WJ</a><br/><p>Extremely well made, that is the least I can say.

They end up dumped unceremoniously at a daycare center for kids whom the toys think will appreciate and play with them just as Andy did--with tender, loving care.<br /><br />As they discover on their first day in the playroom, these kids are a nightmare with toys. Woody resolves to return to his owner's attic while the others stay behind until they must plan their great escape. What happens next is unpredictable from start to finish, the only certainty being that there will be a happy ending--which gives the story a final tug on the heartstrings with a poignant and tender conclusion.<br /><br />This is animation that is beyond clever, as imaginative as a film of this kind can get, masterfully staged and brilliantly animated. It's also a bit scary at times since all of the characters almost meet their final destiny a number of times, long before the story is over, thanks to a villainous plush toy bear called Lotso, wonderfully voiced by Ned Beatty, hug-gable on the surface but a scoundrel at the core.<br /><br />Since all the technical stuff is beyond reproach, there's no reason why TOY STORY 3 shouldn't please fans of the first two in this series. It even exceeds expectations with a story of depth, compassion and humor that gets better as it goes along.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>In Toy Story 3 (2010) Andy, the toys' owner, has grown-up and is going off to college. His mother tells him to decide what he wants to do with his toys, whether they should be donated, put up in the attic, or tossed out. What will become of the toys who need affection, but who never age but can get broken or worn out? The only one he has decided to take with him to college is Woody, the cowboy, who is a replica of a television puppet series character. Through a mix-up, the mother puts out with the rubbish a bag of toys meant for the attic. Luckily the toys escape from the jaws of the trash truck, but they blame Andy for throwing them out. They climb into a box meant for donation to a pre-school nursery.<br />The toys are donated to Sunnyside Daycare. The boss of the toys there (a villain) is teddy-bear Lotso (voice of Ned Beatty). He makes sure that Andy's toys go in the room where a bunch of unruly kids are very rough on the toys and hurl them around. Woody helps to rescue them from this place of horrors. Buzz Lightyear is a featured toy. A new toy is introduced, Ken (voice of Michael Keaton), of the Barbie family, and he and Barbie click. Later there are some heart-stopping moments in the dump when you fear that the toys are going to end up in the jaws of the trash crusher.<br />The tradition of high quality in this series is maintained in this which may be the last in the series. It is one of the best of the animated series ever made. It makes this gang of toys almost into real people with each of the toy characters having an individualized personality. Audiences get emotionally involved; they care about these toys as they would about people. The toys become a family and are interdependent. That is the magic of the films' creators. The voices of Tom Hanks and of the other major stars help to delineate these toy characters. And let's remember there's a lot of comedy in this enterprise.<br />It's a highly imaginative, funny, and emotionally gripping story for adults as well as kids. It's an interesting ironic situation: the human beings are robotic and stagy: the toys are more human than the human beings. These movie are high points in the evolution of animated films.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>I saw this movie for the first time a few hours ago, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Disney & Pixar have crafted another wonderful movie with positive messages, and this one is a fitting conclusion to the Toy Story saga.<br /><br />Biblically speaking, there is nothing offensive. There are a few scenes that may be intense for those under eight years of age, but nothing over the top ("The Wizard Of Oz" and other G-rated films contain scary scenes, but nothing worthy of a higher rating). It earned the G rating, and deserves the Oscars for Best Animated Film and Best Picture that it's been nominated for (the Academy Awards will be in February). I caught myself about to cry during one scene (for fear of revealing a major plot point, I can't and won't say which scene it was). Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and the rest of the cast (minus Jim Varney) return, along with all-new voice casting, which includes the original Batman (Michael Keaton) and my favourite James Bond (Timothy Dalton). I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. Have some tissues handy, because you'll need them. (I do wish Mr. Pricklepants' role had been bigger, though). Keep watching through the credits.<br /><br />Though the end of the film subtly implies that this is the final installment in the Toy Story franchise, I sincerely hope it isn't. For all three motion pictures, the writing, voice casting, animation and all the other production values have been top-notch, as you would expect from Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar.<br /><br />Now that I think of it, there are parallels between this film and the Christian life. SPOILER ALERT. For instance, a toy echoes a non-biblical worldview (something like "We can become the masters of our own destiny"), but it's clearly shown where that train of thought leads them.

The hilarious voice-over talents are prevalent throughout and that special brand of humour unique to Toy Story films is still there. This has a great storyline to keep kids interested and the numerous smaller touches adults will notice to keep things feeling fresh and which Pixar have become renowned for. The animation is as superb as always and I really noticed how well the trees were rendered and the use of light, these may have stood our more on Blu-ray, but they are impressive regardless.<br /><br />All in all this is a worthy successor to the other films and if you enjoyed the previous films (and to be honest didn't we all!) then you should find this enjoyable too. They left things nicely tied up and hopefully Pixar won't feel the urge to rehash this particular franchise as it still has a warm place in many hearts and this film only adds to that. Well worth a viewing at some point.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>Your favorite toys are back in toy story three. toy story three is about what happens when andy goes to collage. I think this movie is great. The original cast is back except Jim Varney(Who Plays Slinky Dog In The first two) R.I.P., and some new cast like the legendary whoopie Goldberg and Michael Keaton who plays Ken. This movie is well made. It is true that it is kind of a sad movie. but i think it needed to be told to conclud the toy story movies. Is this the last? Probably so. well all in all eveybody had a good ride and people will mess these characters. I think alot of people can relate to this movie. Even The villians story was sad, you probably would turn sour if someone left you behind and then you found out that they replaced you. The movie had a great ending even though it was a tearjearker. All in all this movie was awesome and it will be a Disney Classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>"Toy Story" was about sibling rivalry. "Toy Story 2" was about loving others, even if it means you might get hurt someday.<br /><br />So what is "Toy Story 3" about? It takes the whole "kids + loyal toys" theme to its natural conclusion, by showing us what happens when the kids grow up and leave. While the first two-thirds of the movie are fairly pedestrian (for a Pixar movie!), the last part is both action-packed and emotionally wrenching.<br /><br />Ten years have passed, and Andy is now a college-bound teenager.  His toys are anxious about what's going to happen, so Woody keeps assuring them that they'll be put safely in the attic. But a misunderstanding leads to a date with the garbage truck. Since the toys believe they have been abandoned, they jump into the box of donated toys bound for Sunnyside Daycare.<br /><br />They're greeted by the genial Lots-o'-Hugging Bear (aka Lotso) and the friendly daycare toys, and all seems to be well. But Andy's toys soon discover that Sunnyside is a nighmare -- they've been assigned the "Caterpillar Room" for wild abusive toddlers, and Lotso is the Godfatheresque overlord of the daycare. Once Woody learns the true horrors of Sunnyside, he must infiltrate the daycare and somehow get his friends out.<br /><br />You know that the movie industry is officially in a slump when the cleverest, funniest and most touching movie of the summer... is a CGI sequel about toys. "Toy Story 3" starts off rather lightweight at first, with the toys being brought into Sunnyside and Woody setting off in another direction.<br /><br />But once Lotso is revealed as the villain, the movie takes a sharp turn -- it becomes a clever, complex "Great Escape"-style caper, with some moments of G-rated horror (THE MONKEY!) and hilarity (resetting Buzz ends up turning him into a flamenco-dancing suave Spaniard). And while the toys' attempted escape from Sunnyside is taut and genuinely thrilling, it's only the START of the climax -- a harrowing, genuinely scary chase scene that brings the toys together.<br /><br />And there's a bittersweet core to "Toy Story 3": kids grow up, leave home and the people/toys they leave behind are both proud and sad. In the final scenes of the movie,we're quietly ushered through the emotional goodbyes and hellos of growing up.<br /><br />And the adorable little cast of toys still remind us that what matters most is love and loyalty, particularly during a deadly crisis where they all fearfully join hands (it sounds sappy, but it isn't). There's also some endearing additions to the cast -- the foppish clotheshorse Ken, Big Baby, a Totoro, a giggly tricerotops, and the Shakespearean stuffed hedgehog Mr. Pricklepants.<br /><br />It hurts to say goodbye to Woody, Buzz and their friends, but "Toy Story 3" is a fitting farewell that brings the trilogy full circle. Best movie of the summer, hands down.</p></br><a href="../users/A24F1UX8ZT5IXY.html">A24F1UX8ZT5IXY</a><br/><p>I thought Pixar might softball this last installment in the Toy Story series but thankfully that is not the case. This is one diabolical plot and as usual the characters are very clever, the set-ups inventive, and the animation jaw-dropping.<br /><br />The Toy Story series, like most animation these days (Dreamworks, Blue Sky, Sony), highly references classic movies and pop culture. The difference with these three films is that it all supports strong characters who earn their keep. This third film expands upon the same type of mawkishness from the "Jessie" elements in the second installment, deepening its premise with an utterly sinister, fascinating villain who should be the envy of screenwriters everywhere. I was pretty amazed at the undiluted portrayal of evil, so much that I would really hesitate showing this to any kid under seven or eight years old. It was a bit extreme.<br /><br />The creative team also relies way too much on slathering on the emotion with a spatula -- something that I think was done with much more sophistication and delicacy in most of the classic Disney films. However, the issues and emotions they are dealing with do run very deep in all of us, and they tap into a huge reservoir of childhood memories and (somewhat shamelessly) run with it.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>Overall, this movie was a surprisingly decent close to the Toy Story Trilogy. I hope there's no more movies after this, because while this movie was good, the ending was bittersweet and somewhat dissatisfying and there were a couple of rather dark moments (the previous two movies would be appropriate for little kids, but this one is definitely for kids who are a bit older, or for those of us old enough to have seen Toy Story 1 when it first premiered over ten years ago.<br /><br />There were a lot of great characters, lines, and action sequences. There's a lot of funny stuff going on - Andy's imaginative opening scene where the toys were portrayed in a real Wild West atmosphere, various day care scenes, and the escape scene, along with Barbie and Ken getting together.<br /><br />This movie would have been five stars if not for the message conveyed at the ending. Yes, I'm all for donating unwanted toys or passing them down to a younger generation, but I still have a couple of toys from my childhood though most have been given away to younger cousins or donated. For Andy to do what he did to Woody somehow cheapened the times he shared with Woody.  Sure, Woody would probably be lonely at college, but the message conveyed by the ending of the film is that we have to like, give it all away. Sometimes having something from one's childhood - or young adulthood - is a comfort and a treasure for people who have gotten older and passed various phases in life.<br /><br />If the ending had been less bittersweet, then I would give 5 stars. Nonetheless, this is still a very good movie at 4 stars and definitely worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>I finished watching Toy Story 3 and although I still have not seen the first two Toy Story films, I felt that the action and lessons learned were powerfully portrayed, but missing the adult themes and nostalgia that I enjoyed with Wall-E and Up.<br /><br />The film starts out with a short, "Day & Night" which I thought was fun.  Both Day and Night have their pros and cons which we see.  Ah the nightlife of Vegas!  Ah, the beach girls in summer!<br /><br />Many years ago, most films had a cartoon and a newsreel before starting the main picture.  In fact, there were these things called "double features" which you don't see too much of, which had two films playing for a single admission price.  Good old days.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the main event:  Andy's toys are being boxed up and he's on his way to college.  Through an accident, most of Andy's toys almost get trashed (to a toy, being trashed is the same as hell!).  Thanks to some of Woody's (cowboy toy) actions they escape only to end up in Sunnydale, a preschool that has the apparency of lots of kids playing with toys, to being beaten up and busted apart by little children!<br /><br />The toys are not happy with being treated like hammers and paint brushes and want to be played with.  Too bad says "Lotso", a large, toy bear who is literally a dictator running the toy show at the preschool.<br /><br />I came away from the movie with the idea that there are several ways to handle rejection.  Some of the toys, like Lotso, handled rejection by becoming bitter and treating others badly.  He came up with the false idea that "everyone" treats toys like hand-me-downs, that they can easily be replaced, and that they are not appreciated and will eventually be trashed.<br /><br />Andy's toys however deal with rejection in a different way.  They too feel that they are being rejected and trashed.  But they also understand that Andy is growing up and no longer has a need for toys.  They're not too keen with ending up in the attic storage but at least they won't be trashed.  But these toys are flexible:  All they want is to be played with.<br /><br />Finally, Woody is not too keen on being trashed either.  But he wants to maintain status quo.  He feels that they all belong to Andy and should be loyal to him.<br /><br />All three groups have an epiphany of sorts.  Some adapt and well, some just don't change and end up on the wrong side of (something) (no spoilers, sorry!).<br /><br />There are some scenes that might be a bit intense for smaller kids, but I think Pixar earned its five stars because of what it created here has a story lesson, is not knocking you upside the head with its moral lessons, has some conflict and resolution and is fun to watch.<br /><br />For me, not as charming and fun as Wall-E or Up, but still highly recommended for the kids in your life.</p></br><a href="../users/A17BT73RVRQYSP.html">A17BT73RVRQYSP</a><br/><p>Toy story 3 is a fine finish to the franchise a movie that tugs at every possible heartstring that exists, and adds just enough drama to make it unforgettable.<br /><br />Andy is going off to college and it becomes D-Day for the toys, who will end up in the attic, who will be donated, who will be trashed and what lucky few will come with him?<br /><br />There are several excellent scenes, and a few adult gags involving fashion.  The initial pre-school & "Latin lover" scenes are priceless.<br /><br />My only complaint is this.  It was established in Toy Story 2 that Buzz is a very valuable toy.  I think that should have been a factor in what was going on.<br /><br />On and the featurette Night and Day was absolutely fabulous.  It was in the best traditions of the cartoons of the 40's and 50's.  More of those please.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>The moving tale of the toys we love being abandoned by their owner and then realizing they were wrong and trying to escape from a Stalag 17 style prison.  Themes of abandonment, growing up and moving on are rampant.  The secondary characters are particularly good and the voices remain the same (mostly) which I appreciate.  No, I didn't cry at the end, you wusses, and, even if I did, you have no evidence!  Heh.  MY GRADE: A minus.</p></br><a href="../users/A11C43I615R52G.html">A11C43I615R52G</a><br/><p>Watching TS3 the day it premiered, I realized that Pixar has become the greatest movie studio of all time. Don't get me wrong, I always considered it one of the best but I want it to see how they will manage a second sequel of a beloved franchise? Well, they manage it brilliantly and TS3 has become a crowning achievement in Pixar's great catalogue. So far has been 11/11. Perfect in every way.<br /><br />TS3 reunites us with our favorites toys and they haven't age one day. But in reality Andy has and now they face a grim prospect of being neglected or worse, destroyed. I won't give any plot detalis but let me tell you that this movie make me cry. And I never cry in a picture. Never!! Not even in Up in that wonderful beginning, but TS3 did it. The ending is bittersweet and beautiful at the same time. Needless to say the animation is superb, the cast is awesome and the story is excellent. I feel sorry for How to Train Your Dragon because it is a terrific film but can't compare to TS3. It's 2010 best film . Thank you Pixar and thank you Woody, Buzz and the others for once again making us live a wonderful experience. Congratulations.<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br /><br />Now released on Blu-Ray, TS3 is nothing short of fantastic in this set. Picture is completely demo-quality with vibrant colors, sharo detail and lush animation. An amazing transfer.<br /><br />Likewise, the 7.1 DTS-HD MA will rock your house. It envelops you and completely blows you away with the level of clarity that it has.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />This is a 2-Disc BD set that is choked full of bonus material. First you got the delightful theatrical short "Day & Night", you got a PIP commenatry with the director and the producer, a trivia game, a Paths to Pixar featurette that this time feature Editors, a cast reunion, a how to write a screenplay with Michael Arndt, Studio stories, Trailers and much much more. All the features are excellent and will leave you completely satisfied.<br /><br />This set also contains a DVD and a Digital Copy.<br /><br />Closing Thoughts:<br /><br />TS3 is a crowning achievement for Pixar. Where more franchises will fail, Pixar has succeeded triumphantly and this third entry in the TS series is an instant classic. This set is a must own. Completely recommended!!</p></br><a href="../users/AE9V37MS6QY8D.html">AE9V37MS6QY8D</a><br/><p>I've found that Pixar films are often like The Beatles' songs: they first premiered for kids but everyone can enjoy them - and after time and closer examination, you find that they're actually geared more toward adults; they get better as the years progress; and those who don't like them, you seriously question their taste. Sure, there's maybe one or two that aren't too favorable (for me, I compare <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V1Y43W">Cars [Blu-ray</a>], the only Pixar film I'm not too crazy about, to "Revolution 9"), but, mostly, they're all pretty much genius. I realize there are anti-Beatles fans out there who are cursing my words. To them, I say, "Sorry, but I hope you know that whatever musician/band you really love, it's most likely they were influenced by The Beatles. You can't deny that The Beatles are a paramount in the music industry." Anyway, let's move on ...<br /><br />The franchise that built Pixar returns to the masses for a third installment. I remember the first <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030IIYWA">Toy Story (Two-Disc Special Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo w/ Blu-ray Packaging)</a> being really good but I wasn't as crazy for it as most everyone else. Then, the sequel came out and I absolutely loved it. Over the years, I re-watched the first film a few times, and each time I watched it (like the first <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009ZYC1">Shrek (Full Screen Single Disc Edition)</a>), I enjoyed and appreciated it more and more. Like any third film in a trilogy, as a fan or someone who merely enjoyed the first two films, you hope that the last film is just as good, if not better, than the first two. Unfortunately, you're often disappointed. Even the sacred trilogies of the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EN71DG">Star Wars Trilogy</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NTPDSW">The Godfather - The Coppola Restoration Giftset (The Godfather / The Godfather Part II / The Godfather Part III) [Blu-ray</a>] films had fell victim to a bad/subpar final third act. But for those young and old fans of Woody and Buzz and all of Andy's toys, "Toy Story 3" will not disappoint you in the least!<br /><br />The brilliance of the "Toy Story" films is that it's not just a story about talking toys for kids to go ga-ga over. It's also a story about getting older and what that means to you and to those you care about, concern over growing out of relationships, building new relationships, accepting yourself for who you are and being OK with it, and moving on to what's next in life ... even though it can be excruciatingly scary. In this installment, we find the toys looking to find a place for themselves - and overcoming their own insecurities - now that their owner Andy is grown up and moving to college. Now here's where "Toy Story 3" shows its genius. In a trilogy where the human characters, although central to the storyline, haven't had much screen time, this film wraps up Andy's childhood in his home with his mom all in front of our eyes. And for any parent, whether you've had to see your kid(s) off away from home already or still have yet to experience it, it's understandably a bittersweet moment. It's that moment that will have moms weeping like babies, dads struggling to choke back the tears (even for me, who watched this scene with my daughter next to me), and those who don't even have kids appreciating the raw emotion and impact of such an inevitable moment in life.<br /><br />But let's not overlook the extremely clever humor that also goes with the trilogy and especially "Toy Story 3." Not only are talents like Tom Hanks (Woody), Tim Allen (Buzz Lightyear), Don Rickles (Mr. Potato Head?), John Ratzenberger (Hamm the Piggy Bank), Joan Cusack (Jesse), Wallace Shawn (Rex), Blake Clark (filling in for Jim Varney as Slinky Dog), Estelle Harris (Mrs. Potato Head?), and Jodi Benson (Barbie?) effortlessly bringing great laughs, but also newcomers Michael Keaton (Ken?), Whoopi Goldberg (Stretch), Jeff Garlin (Buttercup the Unicorn), Kristen Schaal (Trixie), Bonnie Hunt (Dolly), Timothy Dalton (Mr. Pricklepants), and even baddie Ned Beatty (Lotso) add more humor that is subtle but hilarious without being too goofy or over-the-top - like most kids' movies nowadays. "Toy Story 3" has the entire package: drama, comedy, action, and even romance. But most importantly, it's got heart! This may sound hokey, and any film that tried to capture all of these different genres might come off as such. However, Disney Pixar has mastered their storytelling, and they have an uncanny way of tying all of these perfectly together to churn out some of the best movies (animated or not) today. Their animation has also emphatically improved with this latest release. In the scene where Buzz Lightyear's back panel is being opened and the tiny screws are taken out, when the camera closes up on them, the screws look like actual live-action, non-animated screws. There are several instances where the animation doesn't look like animation at all!<br /><br />One of my absolute favorite films last year was Pixar's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KVZ6G6">Up (Four-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + BD Live) [Blu-ray</a>]. In fact, it's one of my favorite films of all time. With every feature that Pixar has released, I keep wondering when their streak of great films will end. I'm happy that they have yet to release a bad film. Even their animated shorts at the beginning of their feature films are great. This time, their short feature, "Day & Night," is the best they've ever done - in animation and in story. It's my new favorite, taking the place of "For the Birds" which preceded <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00168OIOE">Monsters, Inc. (Four-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy) [Blu-ray</a>], and it should win awards. Overall, I would take movies like "Toy Story 3" over supposed hits like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VPE1B6">Avatar (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo) [Blu-ray</a>] any day! I've seen James Cameron's blockbuster and even though his filmmaking techniques were groundbreaking, the story was extremely predictable just from watching the trailer, uninspiring and trite (the story being a recycled product of several films, most notably "Dances with Wolves," "Pocahontas," and even Cameron's own earlier, better release <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009V7OL">The Abyss (Special Edition)</a>, which focused more on emotion rather than special effects).<br /><br />Sure enough, Pixar has done it again! Their latest is sure to win an Oscar and I'd be surprised if it didn't. "Toy Story 3" is an enjoyable moviegoing experience, regardless of whether you have kids or not. It's a fun ride for all and not to be missed; this should be one of the films you definitely see in the theaters this summer!</p></br><a href="../users/ARFCORBCTKX1J.html">ARFCORBCTKX1J</a><br/><p>If "Toy Story 3" does not have as much free-wheeling humor as the first two films, it more than makes up for it in the overall /darkness/ of the story. This is a tale of having to let go of something you dearly love, and Pixar pulls out all the emotional stops, without getting the least bit syrupy or sappy. Kids /will/ enjoy the film, but many adults will find themselves crying. This isn't to say there's no humor (Buzz's switch to Spanish-language mode is particularly amusing, and Ken takes a lot of poking), but "Toy Story 3" is fundamentally serious. I was worried that it would be a mediocre "tie up the franchise with a third film simply to make a buck", but it is a solid, involving, /genuinely moving/ film.<br /><br />I saw the 3D version, and the thrilling opening sequence shows just how effective 3D can be when properly used.<br /><br />Though a bit disappointing (the overall plot is too much like #2), it is a worthy conclusion to the trilogy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>Emotional and imaginative -that's how the final entry in the enormously popular Toys  trilogy is described in Netflix, and I can't agree more. Who would have thought that one of the very best and most exciting films of the 2010 in the genres action adventure / thriller perfectly and brilliantly mixed with the comedy and touching drama would unfold in the playroom of the regular Anywhere, US suburban kindergarten. Who would have imagined that the bravest, most resourceful, loving, loyal, and lovable  heroes of this adventure will be plastic and metal toys?<br /><br />How often does it happen that not even the first but the second sequel in the popular series will surpass two excellent predecessors on all counts and become a rare film, that would make  even the most ironic and sarcastic male critics who could tear any movie to pieces with their harsh criticism  shed a tear and not be shy to admit it?<br /><br />A very smart person said once: "You need to write for  children like you would for adults,  but even better." Toy Story, Part 3 is  Toy Story, Part 3 is drawn,  programmed, staged, CGIed  and acted  with such brilliance, talent and joy that every viewer, regardless of age becomes a child and is immersed in an extraordinary world of adventure, where one for all and all for one.  By the end of this adventure, the viewers are  left with very special and touching emotions, and realize that they experienced one of the most beautiful and realistic movies about growing up, moving on, and saying goodbye.<br /><br />Bravo Disney, bravo Pixar, bravo American cinema!</p></br><a href="../users/A356HRZZFCEGL1.html">A356HRZZFCEGL1</a><br/><p>***This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />Let me establish at the outset that I have savored and appreciated all three "Toy Story 3" movies for their charm, latent sly satire, cliffhanging adventure, and vivid characters.  At the same time, however, the trilogy continues two dark, harsh themes - abandonment/death and set-in-stone villainy - without really addressing either one squarely.  As the trilogy progressed, first Woody, then Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl, then eventually ALL of the toys confronted abandonment, obsolesence, and even destruction.  The flaming inferno of the garbage incinerator at "Toy Story 3"'s (hereafter TS3's) climax was an indelible symbol of toy oblivion.  But because TS3 is of course a Disney/Pixar movie, no toy buys the farm, not even the suavely ruthless Lotso Hugging Bear.  This is understandable; TS3 would have taken a dive profit-wise even if a minor toy character had been destroyed.  However, TS3 kicks the abandonment can down the road toward the movie's end, where young adult Andy bequeaths all his toys, even Woody whom he improbably wanted to take to college with him, to the little girl who was his neighbor.  Many viewers hail this as an intensely emotional scene, but I think the scene is somewhat overrated because we never knew enough about Andy to be emotionally invested in his sacrifice, and anyway the toys didn't really care about who played with them (as long as they were gentle, of course).  Furthermore, the abandonment issue is not resolved because someday the little girl will become a big girl, and the toys will have to face their abandonment/mortality all over again.  Perhaps that is TS3's morbid point.<br /><br />More distressing is the theme that permeates almost any Disney or Pixar animated feature - once a villain always a villain.  As far as I am aware, the only Disney animated villain, major or minor, who ever repented of his wickedness (at least kinda) was Iago the parrot in the Aladdin movies.  But in the Toy Story trilogy, neither Sid, nor Stinky Pete, nor Lotso rise above bitter evil vindictiveness.  In TS3, Lotso seemed to have a shot at redemption.  We learn of his and his giant baby doll henchman's abandonment by the side of a road by his thoughless female owner.  Woody saves Lotso's life from the conveyor belt leading to the incinerator.  But in the final analysis, the evil force is too strong with Lotso. He forsakes all the toys, compatriots and non-compatriots, to their fiery fate as he attempts to escape. Yet poetic justice intervenes; for his misdeeds, Lotso suffers, not fiery death, but perhaps a worse fate, being pinned to a bug-infested garbage truck grill with other unlucky stuffed animals.  I don't think irredeemable evil is a theme you should sell to impressionable young minds.  It would be nice to demonstrate that, yes, sometimes an evil character can atone for his misdeeds.<br /><br />I don't mean to make TS3 sound so sinister.  For the most part, it is light, cheery, upbeat, and howlingly funny (especially Mr. Potato Head's turn as Tortilla Man).  But it does have a dark underbelly, which in and of itself is not bad, and is actually commendable, but it does not directly deal with that underbelly, and that is not so commendable.<br /><br />3.5 stars out of five.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Well, this lived up to the hype, which wasn't an easy accomplishment. Toy Story 1 & 2 set the bar high so, frankly, I was expecting a disappointment. Thankfully, it didn't happen. In fact, it looks like they saved the best for last.<br /><br />With a bunch of reviews already here, there is no sense going into the story. For those who haven't seen it yet, three surprises stood out for me: (1) the high number of new characters introduced; (2) the darkness of some of them; this is not always a fun story; (3) the incredibly-touching last 15-or-so minutes.<br /><br /> Also, the artwork is at the usual high standard, especially some scenes in the last half hour at the dump yard, of all places. This is a "must" for Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Finally, what's really cool, too, is that the people who voice the main characters are still the same men and women who did the first two films, with the exception of Jim Varney ("Slinky Dog"), who died in 2000. It's great to still hear familiar and distinctive voices, such as those of Wallace Shawn ("Rex"), John Ratenzenber ("Hamm"), Don Rickles and Estelle Harris ("Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, respectively).<br /><br />Kudos to all those involved in making this film. They nailed the essence of "Toy Story" and how much loyalty can mean.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>Yeah, Thumbs-up. The sensitivity required of the writer when scripting a film for a young audience requires particular subtlety in dealing with darker and more adult themes. Add to this the factor that adults are more likely to take their children to see films that they themselves will find entertaining, the writer's task becomes dual in nature. How to make a film satisfy the simplistic narrative requirements of a child, while also satisfying the complex narrative requirements of the adult? Pixar has somehow been able to consistently answer this challenge while putting to shame the quality of writing for strictly adult oriented movies.<br /><br />Highlights included for me:<br /><br />Programmable military jarhead Buzz Lightyear having stick removed from his proverbial blackhole when on "Spanish mode" was funny.<br />The evil bear NOT being redeemed because some people are just bad and that's life.<br />The moment when they're like all going to die and they hold hands and accept their fate was touching. Ken...haaahaaa. Barbie's boyfriend(?) Ken voiced by -I didn't know it while watching- Micheal Keaton. I saw Ken described as a "dandified twit". Hopefully for Barbie he likes girls because it isn't clear that he isn't, ya know. Well I guess that doesn't matter too much since he doesn't have.... and oh yeah their freakin' toys. I almost forgot because the writing is THAT good. You believe in the characters like they're "real".<br />Anyway, Jim Varney is dead and so couldn't voice the Slinky Dog I noticed.<br /><br />The ending of the film did elicit an emotional response from me and that also had to do with the fact that I recall when the first Toy Story came out and I was working at a Burger King and they were selling Buzz Lightyears, Woodys, etc. and that was a longtime ago. The kid in the movie was just a little kid then and now he's off to college like cousins of mine and I feel old. Life is short.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>Wow.<br /><br />This film has some serious BALLS.<br /><br />That's right. This kids film is some ballsy stuff. Ballsier than Apocalypse Now. OK, you may eviscerate me now!!<br /><br />Being a fan of Toy Story 1 and 2 when I was a kid, I knew I was in for a serious ride when I went to the 4 PM IMAX screening on opening day. As I walked into the the theater, I had to tell myself that this is it, this is the last Toy Story movie ever, that I will never see another Toy Story movie again. So as the movie began playing, I prepared myself to say goodbye to my favorite walking talking toys.<br /><br />This movie is simply a gem. I had anticipated it all the way back when I saw the trailer with Up. The whole theatre went "Oh COME ON!!!!" when they found out they had to wait a year to see it.<br /><br />Toy Story shows that Andy has grown up now, is going to college. The toys have been donated to a local daycare, which may seem like a happy place to all the other toys, but Woody can't shake the fact that the person he grew up with, Andy, is away from him now. Sunnyside Daycare has rowdy kids though, who do nothing but destroy the toys. Even worse, Lotso Huggin Bear, Ken, all the others seem nice, but are evil and cruel bastards. Furthermore, Buzz has been reprogrammed to be on Lotso's side. Oh no! The toys must reprogram him, and furthermore, get the HELL out of Sunnyside!!!<br /><br />The film is, in a word, spectacular. I was expecting it to suck, but surprise surprise!!! I loved this film. Great voice acting, great direction, animation is spectacular, and the best thing of the film? The darkness. One incredible scene is where the toys face death as they find themselves in the furnace near the end of the film. That scene had me on the edge of my seat, and hit me like a big bag of bricks. Just powerful, incredible stuff. And BOY did I cry like a baby at the end!!!<br /><br />Overall, it's time to say goodbye to Woody and Co, and TS3 is the perfect opportunity to do so.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Making a sequel is a tricky business, especially when it is a hugely successful series. When it is a second sequel, stakes get higher. Look what happened after the great one-two punch of "Godfather" and "Godfather II," or "Alien" and "Aliens"? So when I heard Pixar was making "Toy Story 3," I was naturally skeptical. After 11 years since "Toy Story 2"?<br /><br />OK, I admit. I was wrong. As many people say, "Pixar can do no wrong." I am not actually sure about that (as the last year's "Up" was something of a disappointment), but as far as the "Toy Story" franchise is concerned, it is true. People at Pixar will not be likely to fail in living up with our expectations.<br /><br />Andy has grown up. As he is leaving home for college, and his sister is moving into his room, there is no reason for his toys to remain there. After some misunderstandings and confusions, Woody, Buzz, Jessie and other lovable toys find themselves in Sunnyside Daycare center, where Lotso, the bear with a strawberry scent politely welcome them. Maybe too politely.<br /><br />"Toy Story 3" is a rip-roaring "Great Escape"-type adventure film with lots of funny moments, providing many rousing action sequences interspersed with comic relief, but there is also a darker aspect to the deceptively simple story, which will make you think, for instance: What happened to Wheezy the Penguin and Andy's other toys? What happened to yours? Where are they now? We are touched by the characters and their struggle to survive because we know exactly that in reality most of them cannot escape the inevitable (an attic or a garbage truck, as the film suggests).<br /><br />That's why the ending is very important. Some viewers may be surprised at the finale which I am sure will make you cry, but this is also a clever way to conclude the story that started 15 years ago. See it for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>First and foremost if you are actually reading this and you haven't seen it, get up off your ass and go to the theater right now! I know it is still playing in a theater somewhere!<br /><br />It has been 11 years since we have seen these characters and I will say when I heard about a script in the works for the third chapter I was a bit skeptical for many reasons. Apparently this movie started out as a direct to DVD release when first conceptualized about...4/5 years ago. It was not going to be in CGI and the plot was about Woody and the gang rescuing Buzz from Japan after he and other first edition Buzz Lightyear figures were recalled to the manufacture. Yea, that could have worked, but this is Toy Story! I mean when we all went to see this movie about 15 years ago we were just awestruck by these unbelievable characters. The movie was full of such magic and the story was so original that is just made you think about your own Toys and how great they felt when you played with them. I know I am going on and on, but that just shows you how meaningful Toy Story is to me and film as a whole.<br /><br />Toy Story 3, does not meet up to the grandeur of its predecessors. Toy Story 3 goes above and beyond anything that this story has given us so far. Toy Story 3 turns this simple little world into a massive epic, and the story itself while it may be so simple and easy to follow, there are just so many different emotional levels seen throughout. There are points in the movie where you will laugh so hard and then in the following scene you will be trying so hard to hold back tears. In the theater I was in, I saw grown men cry. For that to happen because of a movie, it just shows you there is something truly special here. The Pixar animation has come so far since Toy Story, that the textures and scenery that you see in this installment are so believable and lifelike you can almost touch them yourself. The voice acting is fantastic as well. Along with the story, the cast returns and steps up their game as well. Each character is given so much more depth and the funnier members of the bunch get even funnier. On top of that we are introduced a whole new batch of toys. Each one is unique in its own way and the new actors that lent their voices did a wonderful job, it was as almost as if there were there from the start. There are not many jokes that play on satire or pop culture like Shrek, but the humor that is used just works. The movie is great for all ages, but I believe it was really made for those that have been there from the beginning. You can tell by some of the scenes that it is not only because you have known these characters growing up, but it is the fact that you are now seeing these characters as a grown up and how you must have felt when you realized it was time to stop playing with your own toys and if they were like these characters what they must be feeling. On that note, probably the best part of this film would have to be the ending. I don't think I have seen a story end on such a high note since 'Return of the King' It just makes you feel so many different kinds of wonderful emotions. The feelings that you leave with towards these characters, in fact the entire legacy that Toy Story has become, you could not have asked for a more proper send off.<br /><br />Now, after reading this I sure hope that if you haven't seen Toy Story 3 that you will. Brush up on your Toy Story and Toy Story 2, because when you see Toy Story 3 you will be very glad you did. Pixar really has outdone them selves with this film. As a person who has seen almost every Disney animated film and who owns every Pixar film, Toy Story 3 could arguably be the greatest Disney animated film ever made! This movie has been praised by fans and critics everywhere since its theatrical release. It makes me wonder where the Pixar gang will go with future projects, some of which will be sequels to other Pixar classics. In fact I don't think 2010 can possibly give us anything better in film! I have already seen Inception and I have to say that Toy Story just adds that little bit of extra magic. Toy Story 3 to me at this point is the best film of 2010, it has surpassed The Incredibles as my all time favorite Pixar film. I sure hope that this film wins the Oscar for Best Picture of the year, yea I am going to stick to that last statment because a film like Toy Story 3 is why we go to see movies and purchase them in the first place. Not only do we want to be entertained, or just escape the hardships of every day life, in the end what we truly want from the films is that sense of perfection that goes deep within our souls. While that feeling maybe different for everyone if you find that feeling it just sets everything right in the world. Like Peter Jackson, John Lassater deserves his credit that has been due to him ever since he created Toy Story. To get an award as prestigious as the Oscar for best film will show the world that animation can be just as real as live action and if you just have the desire and the passion to create something special that is not depicted by something that is entirely real, you can sure as hell do the best that you can to make it real.<br /><br />BUY THIS MOVIE!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>I'm a huge fan of Pixar, but who isn't? Not many people can claim that there isn't at least one Pixar film in their delightful repertoire that they don't feel strongly about or hasn't moved them in the slightest. But as much as I adore Pixar and as admirable and enjoyable as Toy Story is for introducing the world to a wonderful animation studio, I didn't love the first two films quite as much as most do. I was under the impression I'd feel the same way about Toy Story 3, but luckily I was wrong.<br /><br />Something has to be said about the "Day & Night" short that played before Toy Story 3. It was spectacular. Pixar has always been fantastically imaginative anyway, but "Day & Night" is one of the most original animated shorts I've ever had the pleasure of sitting though. A truly brilliant piece of animation.<br /><br />My mom used to make a career out of making and selling teddy bears, so toys, action figures, and stuffed animals have pretty much always been a part of my life in some capacity. It seemed like we'd always find her bears in spots where we didn't leave them and in positions we didn't remember leaving them in, so we came up with this story that they were alive and would throw parties when we weren't in the room. Everybody played with toys growing up and that's one of the reasons why the Toy Story films are so easy to relate to. Toy Story 3 makes you realize how much you love these characters you've been spending the better part of 15 years getting to know. You don't want to see their adventures end. The fact that Pixar is capable of making its audience care so much about CG animated characters that are made of plastic or whose insides are nothing more than stuffing is extraordinary in itself.<br /><br />Toy Story 3 not only lives up to the first two films, but surpasses them entirely. The third film throws you into this ingenious world where you're just immersed in originality and creativity. Not that the first two films didn't already establish that, but you lose yourself and get sucked in much quicker this time around.<br /><br />Toy Story 3 may not just be a movie of the year candidate, but it might be the most satisfying third film in a franchise ever. It manages to introduce new characters that you grow to care about by the end of the film while effectively ending the story between Andy and his toys. The sequel lives up to Pixar's reputation for being incredibly moving and heartfelt. Toy Story 3 has everything and appeals to all ages. I'm going to go on record as saying that Toy Story 3 is the best Toy Story film to date and easily the best film of the first six months of 2010.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>"Toy Story 3" has the familiar voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and most of the regular all star cast.  This third tale continues about the toys, Woody, Buzz and Jessie, plus all their pals is touching and emotional.  Seeing Andy, their owner, grown up and leaving for college, no longer needing them is sad.  His childhood has past, there are pictures in his room of former play-times with the toys, but the toys are now packed away to be stored in the attic.  The toys strike out on their own and end up at a Day Care Center with rough play times and the tough Teddy Bear boss, makes sure they stay.<br /><br />What happens when boys grow up and toys are no longer needed?  The answer is sweet, surprising and satisfying for all the "Toy Story" fans.<br /><br />The movie is perfection in the Pixar animation, beautiful colors and cinematography, plus adventure and smart doses of comedy.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Toy Story 3" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Woody and Buzz had accepted that their owner Andy would grow up someday, but what happens when that day arrives? In the third installment, Andy is preparing to depart for college, leaving his loyal toys troubled about their uncertain future.<br /><br />The voice cast led by Tom Hanks (as Woody) & Tim Allen (as Buzz) is brilliant! The directing by Lee Unkrich (who also co-wrote the screenplay) (who co-directed and edited "Toy Story 2" (1999), he also edited "Toy Story" (1995), and co-directed "Monsters, Inc." (2001) & "Finding Nemo" (2003) is brilliant! The screenplay by Unkrich, Michael Arndt (who also wrote the story & screenplay to "Little Miss Sunshine" (2006, for which he won an Oscar for his work), John Lassetter (who also executive produced) (who also directed "Toy Story 1 & 2" (also wrote the story), "A Bug's Life" (1998, also wrote the story), "Cars" (2006, also wrote the story & screenplay), he also executive produced "Monsters, Inc.", "Finding Nemo", "The Incredibles" (2004), "Ratatouille" (2007), "Wall-E" (2008), "Bolt" (2008) & "Up" (2009) & Andrew Stanton (who also directed "Finding Nemo" (also wrote the story & screenplay), "Wall-E" (also wrote the story & screenplay) & co-directed "A Bug's Life", he is also directing the upcoming "John Carter Of Mars" (2012, also writing the screenplay), he also executive produced "Monsters, Inc." (also wrote the screenplay), "Ratatouille" & "Up", he also wrote the story & screenplay to "Toy Story 1 & 2" & "A Bug's Life") is brilliant! The music by Randy Newman (who also did the music to "Toy Story 1 & 2", "A Bug's Life", "Monsters, Inc." & "Cars") is brilliant!<br /><br />This is a brilliant, heartwarming (and at some times for a interesting reason, sad) film that will stay with you even after it's done and it also makes you think about certain things in life, especially childhood memories. This is a impressive-looking film, especially in 3D. Disney & Pixar have done it again, brilliantly, with this film. This is just as brilliant as the first two "Toy Story" films. This is the best movie of the summer and of the year, so far, by far. An Oscar winner for Best Animated Feature & Best Original Song.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>After Mickey Mouse and Yo Gabba Gabba, Toy Story is the only other franchise my three-year-old son is familiar with. We reluctantly let him watch Toy Story and Toy Story 2.  It's interesting when you watch a G-rated movie before you have kids and compare it to your experience after you have kids.  The Toy Story series has a lot of things toddlers are taught not to do - calling each other idiots, punching each other in the face, and otherwise using "not nice words" that is an integral part of any comedy act. It's funny, but it ain't for kids.<br /><br />That's the brilliance of the Toy Story series.  It's about childish things but not about children.  The first Toy Story movie was as much about being a parent as it was about being a toy.  In Toy Story the parent (Woody) was replaced by the boy's new stepdad (Buzz).  Woody, old-fashioned and stubborn, had to blend the new and old families in a way that respected everyone involved.  And they did, unified by the love of their "son" Andy.<br /><br />Toy Story 2 was about putting the parent's needs above the child.  An injury reminded Woody of his mortality. He had an opportunity to forge his own path, independent of Andy.  Instead he chose to stay with the boy, forgoing fame for the love of his child.<br /><br />Toy Story 3 reaches the logical outcome that loomed in Toy Story 2.  Andy grew up. He's moving on to college and his "parents" are left behind. What's to become of them? Will they be stored away in some old attic, forgotten?  Or will they find a new life in retirement?<br /><br />Toy Story 3 is all about family.  What's more important is that they stick together, a point repeated by Buzz and Woody. They may lose their child, but at least they have each other.<br /><br />Toy Story 3 is also a prison caper, complete with seemingly pleasant wardens, a prison gang, and escape attempts. And yet Toy Story 3 is far more entertaining than most live action prison escape movies. Packed with action, filled with poignant moments, and featuring all the characters we've come to know over a decade, Toy Story 3 is a love note to the toys - and people - we've left behind.  More Escape from Preschoolcatraz than a comedy, Toy Story 3 is an adult take on an adult problem.  It just happens to use toys to tell the tale.<br /><br />My son won't be watching Toy Story 3 until he's a lot older.</p></br><a href="../users/A15U64VGUV6RBF.html">A15U64VGUV6RBF</a><br/><p>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, as will you. It's another great story from the Pixar team, and a worthy sequel in the Toy Story saga.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C9GCHR99WX3F.html">A1C9GCHR99WX3F</a><br/><p>The toys finally return after 1999's Toy Story 2 movie, but which is rare for 3 movies to have good reviews animated or not. It is rare for 3 films to be this strong, even without running out of gas at some point, how many can say that? There are a of returning toys, and then some new toys including Barbie getting her Ken. Or does she I am going to leave it up to you to find out. And seeing this being a Disney-PIXAR film, I was expecting this to get and win for best animated feature film, these films seem to be a lock for it. While I am lost to tell you what I liked best about this film, I can tell you do things that I didn't lkike the film, there are a couple. One I didn't like and that I was hoping that it wasn't going to, but did anyways the words idiot and moron are used in the film. But I realized that they used in the first 2 movies they had either one or both the words in the movies. The movie opens with the toys in a western opening scene with some of them good guys and others like Hamm on the bad guys. Then they have a montage of Andy growing up. Then we get to really the present of the movie where Andy ( voiced by John Morris) is now 17 years old, and now is getting set to leave home for college. And he stills lives with his mom and kid sister, Molly that we also get to see more grown up. The toys are now bound for his toy chest, or the ones that are left over, including Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), Jessie the Cowgirl (Joan Cusack), Slinky Dog (Blake Clark replacing the late Jim Varney), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), and the Potato Heads Mr. and Mrs. (Don Rickles and Estelle Harris). The toy soliders are still around, lead by Sarge (R. Lee Ermey)  decide their time is up, and time to leave, before they end up in garbage bags. All the rest of the toys are not in the film, but the film does mention 2 of the toys tat are gone, but never really explains what happened to them, other then they had gone missing. Or even gone on to better owners. So while the toys place a phone call on a phone to Andy, whose cell phone is in with the toys, just hoping to be played with again. But Andy has pretty much grown up, and he believes and warns his baby sister Molly (Beatrice Miller), about staying out of his room. Then his Mom (Laurie Metcalf) tells Andy that it is time to clean his room, which includes packing up for garbage, throwing trash out. And which includes his toys, that they either have to be packed away for college, or put in the attic or they will be thrown away. And he does it, he places all but Woody in Trash bags, meaning to take them up to the attic. Woody is packed in the box for college, but gets out, and Andy is about to put the bag of toys in the attic, when he leaves them on the floor, and the doors closes itself for the attic, to help Molly out, and his Mom finds the bag and assumes it is garbage. The big problem, the only toy that really saw what happened is Woody, and when he finds the rest of the toys, once they have been taken to the garbage. But they mange to sneak into her car, and along with Molly's old toys, they are donated to a daycare named Sunnyside. Where they are welcomed by Lots-O'Huggin' Bear (Ned Beatty ) who turns out to be the movie, and we also meet Ken (Ned Beatty).  They are assigned to a room with the toddlers, which leads to playtime that they didn't expect or want. The rest of the movie I am going to leave up to you. One other problem I do have with the movie, there is not a whole lot of new music in this movie, there is only one new song that plays during the end credits, and I really don't think that it is memorable enough, or good enough for Best Original Song, which it got nominated for and one, the only other song that plays during the movie is You've got a Friend in Me once again sung by Randy Newman.</p></br><a href="../users/AOYTQFRLD8VLP.html">AOYTQFRLD8VLP</a><br/><p>Well, I thought they could go no further with this tale after "Toys Story 2", but the imaginators at Pixar weren't quite done with this one yet.<br /> 15 years after the world first met Woody(Tom Hanks), Buzz(Tim Allen), and the gang, we find out what will subsequently happen when Andy(John Morris) does go to college and decide the fate of his beloved childhood playthings.<br /> Andy's Mom(Laurie Metcalfe) and sister, Molly(Beatrice Miller) are dealing with this rite of passage, helping him decide what to take, and what to leave behind.<br /> In the meantime, Andy's toys, which have been neglected for a considerable amount of time, are desperately stooping to subterfuge just to get Andy to pay attention  to them and even to just hold them again after so many years.<br /> We learn that some of the family have departed--the penguin, Wheezy and Woody's beloved Bo Peep having been lost to new owners in yard sales.The precious play things have been forced to regroup, and have adapted sufficently to the situation by now, but are still confined to a box. Woody, however, may be slated to go to college with his owner.Anticipating  that they will be discarded rather than given away, the little green soldiers(with R. Lee Ermey as their sergeant) depart.<br /> But soon the group, including Jessie( Joan Cusack), Mr. Potato Head(Don Rickles), Mrs. Potato Head( Estelle Harris)Slinky, (Blake Clark, replacing the late Jim Varney), the three Aliens( Jeff Pidgeon),Bullseye(Frank Welker), Hamm(John Ratzenberger), and Rex(Wallace Shawn) mistakenly end up at a daycare center, where they encounter Stretch the Octopus(Whoopi Goldberg), Molly's former Barbie doll(Jodi Benson) who was intended for the nursery school, Barbie's dim-witted clothing fanatic counterpart, Ken(Michael Keaton),Big Baby,Chuckles the Clown(Bud Luckey) and last but not least, the intially friendly but eventually sinister Lots-O-Huggin' Bear(Ned Beatty).<br /> The new arrivals are overwhelmed by the onslaught of small children, and ask to be placed in the room with the slightly older charges. But the menacing Lotso refuses and through means of intimidation plans to keep them in their place.<br /> Having left one eye behind at Andy's house. Mrs. Potato head discovers that their arrival at the nursery school was  a mistake, and eventually, after some misgivings, conspire to return home. A temporary separation from the gang results in Woody's encounter with a young charge named Bonnie, (Emily Hahn) who takes him home, and places him in her room with Trixie, the toy Triceratops(Kristen Schaal),the porcupine Mr. Pricklepants(Timothy Dalton) and the purple-haired Dolly(Bonnie Hunt).<br /> Chuckles explains how and why Lotso came to be the twisted character that he became, and despite having the toys under marshall law in the afterhours , and some potentially harrowing experiences, we know Andy's toys will always find a way back to their owner, and that anyone who stands in their way will end up where they do not want to be.<br /> In watching this, I have recalled how a girl I once babysat thought her Ken Doll was stupid, and I wonder if my now-grown former charge had a hand in making this film. But Ken's shortcomings, and support from allies such as the Chatter Telephone(Teddy Newton)--a toy I had when I was young,  combine to tip the balance in the toys' favor. We even learn along they way, that Buzz has a Spanish mode(Javier Fernandez Pena)!<br /> If Andy only knew what his toys went through to stay with him over the years!<br /> Well, all good things must come to and end, and this tale  deals with the realities of growing up, and moving on, with one last fling with friends for old time's sake. As the trilogy gently reaches its poignant conclusion which can make grown men mist over, we leave this beloved ensemble in very good hands.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>Pixar doesn't seem capable of falling into the cute-zone that Disney ( and, yes, I do realize Pixar is partnered with Disney... ), and a good many other studios that produce animation movies do, and as with WALL-E, TOY STORY 3 strikes no false notes. I was almost wishing for my childhood again, after seeing this eye-popping pic ( it might be a bit scary for 5-year olds, however ), and it's not just because of the amazing voices behind the iconic characters, or the incredible animation, but the story is way beyond the merely adequate. TOY STORY 3 simply has great humor, wonderful characters, and an amazing amount of heart. I rate it 'G' for genius.</p></br><a href="../users/AMP7TQRWAIE84.html">AMP7TQRWAIE84</a><br/><p>The title says it all. It leads me to believe that this movie might be more geared to a broader audience as opposed to mainly children. There are bright, funny and just darn cute sequences to be seen here but even more parts that will make you think, feel bad (yet invested) and just plain wanna see Andy's old chums make it through their stay at Sunnyside Daycare. In fact, I never expected this movie to take such a route.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I highly and thoroughly enjoyed this endeavor. Never have I seen a Pixar movie this great! This special! This elite! Some of the onlookers may be quite disappointed because the story gets dark. And when it's dark, it can seem grim. There are plenty times when it feels like there is no hope in sight. Just keep watching and stick it out. I got super-invested and you just might too.

The latest iteration of the Toy Story series milks the generational span of the fans that were kids for the first in the series.  In the film, the toys are packed up and stored or discarded when their master, Andy, leaves for college.<br /><br />The journey the toys must take is a metaphor for the perils and spiritual fears many of us experience in real life.  The toys take a journey that literally leads to the gates of hell -- a yawning, gaping, molten fire-pit at a mammoth recycling center.  Not sure what the lesson is here, or how Jung might explain the symbolic meaning of the events and the identity of the toys themselves.  I always thought it was interesting that the two leads were called Buzz and Woody.  Drugs and sex seemed to more than an accidental inference.  There are other subversive moments disguised as a kid's movie.<br /><br />This is a reverse coming of age movie in which a human character comes to terms with his childhood and the non-human characters continue with their imagined lives.  But in whose head are they dwelling.  We all know they are merely inanimate, non-sentient toys.  Don't we?<br /><br />All the original voice talent are back including Tom Hanks and Tim Allen plus Michael Keaton as Ken and Ned Beatty as Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear.<br />The Blu-ray transfer, both image and sound, is simply breathtaking, certainly cutting edge.  There's something hypnotic about the world of the story and the incredible attention to detail -- especially the physics of the movement, the texture and lighting.  The generous extras will fascinate for hours and hours.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>After the imaginative brilliance of "Up" (2009), Pixar concludes the "Toy Story" trilogy in equally memorable fashion.

Terrific family entertainment and a refreshing alternative to Hollywood's junk-food cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>After watching this film I have to admit that the Toys are my favorite Disney characters ever! In this one, Andy has grown up and is preparing for college. The toys are worried that they will be thrown away as Andy is no longer interested in them. Only Woody is sure that Andy would never do that. In fact Andy packs Woody to take to college with him and sets the other toys aside to put in the attic.<br /><br />Andy's mother accidentally thinks the toys are meant for the garbage and puts them out. Only some last minute action by Woody and TRex save the toys from being garbage fodder (this is an omen of a larger danger later in the film).<br /><br />Andy's mother than thinks the toys were meant to be donated and she then takes them to a day care center. The toys at first thinks they have arrived in Heaven because they meet a whole bunch of new toys led by a big pink teddy bear who tells them they will be played with all day.<br /><br />Unfortunately, things are not as good as they seem as the daycare starts looking like a prison and dangers abound. There are a lot of touching moments in this film and don't be surprised to shed a tear or two.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film as much as the other two. The authors have made another fun and original story and all the toys still have the same voices, except Slinky Dog whose orignal actor passed away. On the DVD extras, the new voice of slinky dog is the original actor's friend and he tells how he imitated the original actor's voice. Also, on the extras we get to meet the voice of Andy who is the same actor (now in his 20's) who needed to be tracked down and luckily was delighted to do the voice again. Ned Beatty is the pink teddy bear, Michael Keaton plays a "sleazy" Ken doll and Whoopie Goldberg even has a character.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>To wish that a movie is the last in the franchise sounds somewhat negative.  However, the story arc and resolution of Toy Story 3 is so poignant and effective that it can't be followed by a new story.  In short, the plot centres around a college-bound Andy who has outgrown his toys - Woody, Buzz, Rex, Ham, etc.  In a series of misunderstandings, they all end up at a daycare centre.  This is all pretty lightweight stuff so far, and not very interesting.  When they get to the daycare, however, the plot thickens as they discover it is run by a big Strawberry-scented bear named Lotso who runs the place like a banana-republic dictatorship.  Andy's toys are banished to the room with the youngest children who proceed to misuse them dreadfully (e.g. using Jesse's hair as a paintbrush).<br /><br />Many people have compared the film to the Great Escape, and indeed the best part of the movie involves the elaborate plan to break out of Sunnyside Daycare.  It also borrows somewhat from Bridge on the River Kwai, with Buzz collaborating (after being factory-reset) with Lotso's crew, and Woody, having escaped, returning to help his friends' cause.  This is the point where the screenwriters show their cleverness - Pixar films always work best when the stories don't simply set a human story being played by toys (or animals or cars) but where the solutions grow organically from the properties of the toys themselves.  Hence, Mr. Potato Head uses the fact that his parts still work when detached from the potato to great effect.  Barbie uses Ken's metrosexuality as a weapon against him to extract vital information from him.  And when Buzz is re-reset and ends up in Spanish mode.... well, that is sheer brilliance.  Their Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Story is well-earned.<br /><br />This is clearly the most emotionally loaded Toy Story, and is very intense at the end.  Certainly, my 5-year old was okay watching it, but my 3-year old was scared and refuses to watch the end parts.  That gives you an indication of the level of intensity if you plan to but this for younger children.  I don't think it's giving anything away to say there is a happy ending, but perhaps not the one you'd expect (yes, Andy goes to college and the toys do not accompany him).  Luckily, the end credits provide a very important (and funny) wrapup to let you end on a smile.  (In fact, I can't think of a more effective use of a song at the end of a film, except possibly "Always Look On the Bright Side of Life" at the end of Monty Python's Life of Brian.)<br /><br />Ultimately, this film may endear itself to me as my favourite Toy Story.  I'm not ready to make that decision yet (having only watched it 4 or 5 times), but it's certainly the equal of the first two films in the franchise.  I bought the DVD version (because Disney Blu-rays drive me nuts!), and there are some neat extras, certainly enough for me without an entire 2nd disc of extras like in the 3-disc Blu-ray set.</p></br><a href="../users/A2INL3AYAT6325.html">A2INL3AYAT6325</a><br/><p>As of my posting this this is the biggest film of 2010 and the biggest animated film of all time.<br /><br />A good film.  NOT perfect.<br /><br />You do get the point of the film pushed at you enough about Andy grown up & the toys ending up at Sunnyside.<br /><br />They could NOT come up with new music.  We get AGAIN "You Got A Friend In Me" by Randy Newman.  We know Randy does the Pixar film music, BUT THE SAME SONG FROM THE 1ST FILM?<br /><br />We get introduced to a bunch new toy characters, only a hand full do we really get to see/know.  Quick line near the beginning of the film as to why some characters from the first two films did not return.  An easy bail.<br /><br />You may have heard you will tear up at the end.  Yes, you may.  They did carry the ending out a bit too long & as I said above you get the point all the toys have too much.  WE GET THE POINT, DO NOT NEED TO HEAR IT EVERY OTHER LINE.<br /><br />The Buzz reprogrammed old story line from the 2cd film.<br /><br />The beginning bit with the toys when Andy is still a kid was good.  One can always use a pink Vette.<br /><br />Normal extras on this 1 disc DVD, but nothing special.  NO CHAPTER SEARCH LIST.<br /><br />It is a good sequel, better than MOST 3rd films.  If you liked the first two films you will like this 1.<br /><br />And, when Batman gets to be Ken  & a James Bond in the film as well, worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />  I was looking forward to seeing Toy Story 3 since I enjoyed Toy Story 1 & 2 so much. The question remains whether Toy Story 3 measures up to its predecessors. All the main characters are back including Woody and Buzz Lightyear and the Pixar animation, with its attention to extreme detail, is even better. It was a good idea not to bring back all the toys from the previous features and dispensing with the toy soldiers (for example), by having them 'bail out', was quite clever.<br /><br />  The plot begins in the present, with the toy's owner, Andy, now about to go away to college. He packs up his toys (excluding Woody who he intends to take with him to college) and puts them in a bag, about to bring them upstairs to the attic for storage. Somehow he gets distracted and his mother mistakenly throws the bag with the toys out in the trash. The toys manage to escape from the bag but jump into a box marked for the Sunnyside Day Care Center. Woody manages to follow the toys to the day care center and insists they should all return to Andy before he goes away to college. The toys, however, don't relish the idea of being no use up in the attic and stage a mutiny. Woody leaves his colleagues, only to end up in the home of Bonnie, a young child, who has some neat, new toys including a Shakespearean hedgehog, Mr. Pricklepants, and a scatterbrained triceratops, Trixie.<br /><br />  Unlike Toy Story 1 & 2, which featured human antagonists (the vicious child 'Sid' in "1" and Al McWhiggin, the conniving toy store owner in "2"), Toy Story 3's antagonist is Lotso, a bear with a chip on his shoulder. It seems that Lotso was lost by his previous owner, a child named Daisy, who replaced him with a similar looking model. Somehow the idea that the innocent toy world can be corrupted by an evil seed within its own ranks isn't as effective as having human antagonists. That's because I think it's better to depict the toys as essentially representing the innocent and positive world of childhood with the negative force derived from the worst aspects of adulthood. In Toy Story 1, Sid is a child, obviously conditioned to be a 'monster' by his parents; and in Toy Story 2, Al the toy store owner, embodies the sin of avarice, which must be opposed through the 'goodness' of Andy's toys. In a sense, 'toydom' is diminished by pitting toy against toy and the point that adults are responsible for causing the problems of childhood, is lost.<br /><br />  The other problem I found with the plot is that Andys' toys' reaction to Lotso's directives was unfounded. You'll recall that Andys' toys claim that being placed with the 'younger children' is inappropriate; but as toys, they should expect to be thrown around by younger children (isn't that what younger children do with toys?). And was Lotso being so unfair when he demands that the new toys be placed with the younger one's first, since they're "first in line"? Notice at the end of the film, when 'fairness' is supposedly restored, Ken and Barbie are now running the day care center, now allowing all the toys to take turns, interacting with the younger and more disruptive children. Note that the toys will still be subjected to being thrown around by the younger children--simply less often.<br /><br />  Still, Toy Story 3 is filled with thrilling scenes, reminiscent of its predecessors. After Andy's toys attempt to escape from the day care center, we're taken on a wild ride inside a trash compactor. The toys face their 'dark moment of the soul' as they're about to be burnt alive in an incinerator; after Lotso fails to save them by pushing the compactor's stop button, they're miraculously saved by squeeze toy aliens who somehow manage to stop all power by operating the controls in the control room.<br /><br />  There are other neat scenes in Toy Story 3 including Buzz turning into a Lothario after accidentally being set on 'Spanish mode', Barbie and Ken falling in, then out of love and back in love again, Ken's hilarious wardrobe display and the fantastic introductory sequence featuring a wild chase involving both a train and a spaceship.<br /><br />  For those who haven't seen Toy Story 1 & 2, Toy Story 3 might seem like a masterpiece. But for those who have seen the two earlier incarnations, one can only conclude that "3" just isn't quite as good. "3" does get marks for trying however. The theme that one cannot hold on to the past is ably embodied in Woody's resistance to leaving Andy and finally accepting, along with the rest of Andy's toys, the idea that it's time to move on. On the other hand, it's sad to see Lotso, pinned to the front of a garbage truck, with the implication that he may be the victim of his new owner, who might be some kind of sadist or pervert. The image of an innocent child's toy, made to represent some demonic force, is all wrong and sadly makes Story 3 inappropriate for younger viewers.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Lee Unkrich's "Toy Story 3" plays a little like an expanded version of "Puff the Magic Dragon" crossed with Rankin/Bass' "Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer"  - with a bit of "Stalag 17" and "The Great Escape" thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />It's eleven years since we last checked in on Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Jessie and all the other occupants of little Andy's toy box.  Only little Andy ain't so little anymore, and as he embarks on a new life in college, his once-beloved companions fret over what is to become of them now that they'll no longer be getting the kind of attention and affection all toys need to be happy (actually they haven`t been getting much play time at all for the past few years of Andy`s adolescence).  Woody insists that they must stay loyal to Andy, but the others fear it may be time to move on to friendlier, more kid-centric territory or face an ignominious end, thrown to the curb so some giant garbage truck can scoop them up and mash them into plastic pulp.  Instead, through a series of crazy misunderstandings, they all wind up in the local daycare-center-from-hell (sort of a more sinister version of the Island of Misfit Toys), where they are placed at the mercy of both a band of overexcited toddlers and a bunch of sadistic playthings who rule the place with an iron fist.  Only Woody manages to escape their evil clutches and, like the true cowboy hero of old, he comes up with a plan to rescue his desperate compadres from this virtual armed camp, ironically named Sunnyside.<br /><br />It seems redundant at this point to keep heaping praise on these Pixar productions, so let me just say that "Toy Story 3" is a true crowd-pleasing delight, a witty, endlessly inventive, and visually stunning animated movie that works equally well for youngsters who are still playing with their toys and old folks who might well become inspired to head up to that old attic and dust off some long-forgotten buddies of their own.  The voice work by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Ned Beatty, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, Estelle Harris, et.al., brings each and every one of these charmingly diverse and beautifully differentiated characters to vivid life.  We're so familiar with them ourselves at this point that they almost feel like they came out of OUR toy boxes.  It's also fun watching the movie make villains out of some seemingly innocuous, even cuddly, toys like the embittered, strawberry-scented teddy bear who runs the joint and a diaper-clad baby doll that serves as his loyal henchman.<br /><br />In addition to high comedy, Michael Arndt`s script provides a careful balance of breath-bating suspense and heartbreaking sentiment (believe me, there won't be a dry eye in the house at the end), as it explores the universal themes of camaraderie, friendship and the importance of working together in a common cause.<br /><br />Whether young or old, 2-D or 3-D, at "Toy Story 3," everyone can be a kid again.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>I grew up with the characters of Toy Story; the first film being released when I was 3, the second when I was 7, and the third months after I turned 18. With that in mind, it's worth noting that there's an added pathos to the proceedings in that regard. Toy Story 3 is Pixar's conclusion to their Toy Story films and while many studios could have just made a cash-grab based on an established name, Pixar has produced one of the best "threequels" you could hope to find. The film is the highest grossing movie of 2010 and it's been established by audiences and critics that saying a negative word about it is hearsay; but, luckily, that's not necessary here.<br /><br />Andy is now all grown up and off to college, while his favorite toys have been cast off into the toybox hoping for the off-chance that Andy will play with them again. Planning to take his favorite toy Woody (Tom Hanks) to college with him and putting the rest of the gang in the attic, a mistake leads all the toys to end up at Sunnyside Daycare. A new villain emerges as the soft-spoken, purple teddy bear Lotso (voiced by Ned Beatty) along with his henchmen Big Baby and Ken (Michael Keaton).<br /><br />All of the main characters and voice cast from the previous two films return (with the exception of the late Jim Varney) and none of the charm of the original films has been lost. The toys really take center stage in this film, with very little human involvement this time around. In terms of storytelling quality and execution, Toy Story 3 is exactly what you'd come to expect from Pixar studios. Endlessly creative in their endeavors, I found the new toy additions brilliantly used (my favorites being Chuckles the Clown and the "eye in the sky" Monkey).<br /><br />It's a wonderfully creative film that I enjoyed even more the second time around. It's got a witty, poignant script by Oscar-winning screenwriter Michael Arndt ('Little Miss Sunshine'), sight gags that are as amusing as ever, and voice work by actors who haved stayed with these characters for over 15 years yet never lose their energy and flair. The latest voice actors to join are particularly good, notably Ned Beatty, alternating between comforting and sinister and Michael Keaton, a total scene-stealer.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, growing up with these films in the way I have has added a significant amount of pathos. This is not more apparent than it is at the film's conclusion. The conclusion of Toy Story 3 is one of the most heartwrenching scenes I've ever encountered in an animated film. It may be because it seems symbolic of my own childhood ending or that it's just a really well-executed conclusion, but whatever the case...I can't help but be impressed by an animated film that nearly moves me to tears.<br /><br />Toy Story 3 is not my favorite film of 2010 or even my favorite animated film of 2010, but I have to agree with the general consensus that it's one of the best films of 2010. An entertaining, amusing, exciting, crowd-pleasing close to an iconic trilogy of films that will appeal to both adults and children alike. There really isn't a negative thing to say about it.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI.html">A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI</a><br/><p>All Things Must Change. That seems to be the main message to the third & final Toy Story movie. As fans have waited eleven years for the next sequel, the sequel itself has noted the passage of time...Andy is now a young man & ready to go off to college. His toys--whom he has outgrown--are despondent that Andy no longer plays with them. So it's up to the attic as storage for the toys; except a terrible mistake sends the gang to a pre-school called Sunnyside. Thinking the place is a new life for them, they soon learn they've been duped: The place is a prison, a living nightmare as they are caged at night & put at the mercy of ruthless toddlers during the day. This is where the storyline becomes surprisingly dark as Woody returns to rescue his friends & hatch sort of a "Mission Impossible": Get everyone past security, "all-seeing monkeys", and all kinds of obstacles so they can be reunited with their owner.<br />Disney-Pixar just never ceases to amaze me. The first two films were oh-so-imaginative & clever--with the trademark Disney "heart"--but this one pulls out all the stops. It's full of thrilling, almost suspenseful twists & turns, humor & powerfully emotional moments. And what can I say about the animation that hasn't been said? It's simply wonderful. The voice talent, as usual, is superb. Veteran actor Ned Beatty turns in a good performance as Lotso, the bear that's cuddly & sweet-smelling on the outside, but hides a dark heart of cruel villainy inside. Michael Keaton also has some wonderfully hammy moments as Ken.<br />There's the usual satiric toy humor here, but what will probably get to you are the heart-wrenching moments. Namely, when the gang finds themselves hopelessly staring death in the face, and touchingly holding hands as the end draws near; and the finale, as Andy donates his toys to a sweet little girl down the street, allowing himself one last play with his "old pals" before heading to college. It's a fitting ending to a charming trilogy.<br />Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A2II09GQGWOMTQ.html">A2II09GQGWOMTQ</a><br/><p>I'm still waiting for Pixar to make a bad movie.<br />It hasn't happened yet.<br /><br />Toy Story 3?<br />Excellent animation, pacing, acting, score, voice acting etc...<br />A great way to wrap up the trilogy.<br /><br />The bad?<br />It does seem to drag a little in the middle and the human characters still grate on my nerves.<br />Yes, like everyone else I shed a tiny tear at the end.<br />Not nearly as adult oriented and tear jerky as "UP" but still a great film and a great ending to the franchise.<br /><br />Toy Story comes...highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>TOY STORY 3 is an awesome movie!  Hilarious & heartbreaking.  Witty & wise.  A must-see.<br /><br />That opening paragraph ought to be enough, but in case you need more, I'll try.  Honestly, though, it is a bit tough, because this movie delighted me on a much more personal and visceral level than most.  If you were a fan of the first two films (and I am HUGE fan), then TOY STORY 3 is a near perfect culmination and summation of both the surface stories of these beloved characters and the deeper themes of friendship, responsibility, aging, learning  & growing that the first films were.<br /><br />The toys of TOY STORY and TOY STORY 2 are much older now.  Of course, they haven't really changed...they are always toys.  But their owner, Andy, is now just days from leaving for college, and he's packing up his room.  The toys are understandably very concerned:  will they go with Andy to college (highly unlikely), will they be consigned to the attic (not great, but there's always the hope that one day Andy will share his toys with his own children) or will they be consigned to the curbside garbage?  Through a series of misunderstandings, most of the toys end up being donated to a nearby Daycare Center, where they join a motley crew of other donated toys.  (And in the film's most inspired addition, they meet Ken...who is perfectly conceived.  He's a man, but he's meant to be a girl's toy, so his attitude is decidedly "clothing/fashion friendly".)  And all is not as it seems at this daycare center, from evil toys who run the nights like a less-than-benevolent dictatorship to the very young kids whose enjoyment of toys consist of bashing them on the floor.  Our poor friends are subjected to horrific abuse...and it's up to Woody, the original hero, voiced by Tom Hanks, to save them.<br /><br />(You'll notice I'm not spending a lot of time describing the toys.  Honestly, if you don't know them already, don't see TOY STORY 3 until you've enjoyed the other two.  It is absolutely essential that you know these characters already, because the filmmakers sure assume that you do.)<br /><br />The film is packed full of hilarious scenes (the "escape from prison" scene has the best Mr. Potato Head gag possible) and witty conceits (the aforementioned Ken, a dinosaur with a Facebook account, etc.)  As with the prior films, it has delightfully clever "jokes only adults will get" but as opposed to the SHREK movies, for example, it's tone is always one of childlike wonder.  TOY STORY 3 plays to an audience of kids...and yes, it's a total clich&eacute;...it plays to the kid in all of us.  In fact, to get the full emotional resonance of these films, you MUST be an adult.<br /><br />Once all the action and plot is nearly resolved, the film circles back to the issue that's been roiling underneath since the beginning of the film (and possibly even since the beginning of the series)...what happens to the devoted toys when their master outgrows them.  The final 10 minutes or so of the film will devastate you.  In a good way...but nonetheless, be prepared with extra tissue.  You get a good, old-fashioned wallow in tear-jerking...and even though a nitpicker could argue that no college bound student could possibly act in quite the way Andy does, you just embrace it anyway and let the feelings wash over you.<br /><br />It's hard for me to imagine being more satisfied with the conclusion of such a beloved series.  To say "Pixar has done it again" is yet another clich&eacute;.  But it's more true than ever.</p></br><a href="../users/AFV2584U13XP3.html">AFV2584U13XP3</a><br/><p>After so many years they've finally released the third and final Toy Story movie and like many others have said probably the best of the three and the most tear jerking emotional of them all.  AS you see that Andy has finally grown up and now starts his life going to college the toys wonder what's going to happen to them and as you see the situations and shenanigans they get into we make you laugh as you see the incredible CGI animation that is this movie,  but also they have a wonderful moral built into the movie as well that make it a wonderful movie for both kids and adults to watch.  All the characters and voice cast are back for this final movie which was great as they sometimes have to get new voices because of previous commitments that the actors and actresses have made with prior deals an the like but luckily this wasn't the case.  All I can say is if you've seen the other two movies this is a must see and while you get the laughter you'll also have some tear jerking scenes too though the ending while somewhat sad is also heart warming as you see what happens and the choice one former boy now a young man makes.  Also hopefully they end this trilogy here as they don't try and make it a cash cow like they've done with the Shrek franchise...</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>When the original TOY STORY debuted in theatres in 1995, I sat awe struck at the brilliance of the opening scene and how they did the lighting from the bedroom window and the shine of the wood floors. The shadows and the colors were unbelievable. Then, the toys came to life when the people weren't looking and I knew I was watching a gem of long lasting origin.<br /><br />It didn't take long for the brilliance of the animators and the writers to bring 'toys' to life, not only on screen, but in our minds and hearts. We could feel their plite. They had a seemingly simple life: be toys, love their owners and do whatever it took to continue to be Andy's toys. We can all relate. We've all had to get rid of toys, or replaced toys with new ones, or watched Mom put our favorite toys in a garage sale, or inevitably outgrew toys to the point that if we were still playing with them... we'd be made fun of.<br /><br />Toy Story 3 comes full circle and brings out emotions that I challenge any film out there with human actors to top. The toys are plain and simple... LOVE. That's their sole purpose in life. To Love and to be loved. A valuable lesson to all of us. So, as they once again try to find out a way to continue to be Andy's toys, Pixar not only duplicates the heart and soul of the first 2 movies, but surpasses. Somewhere along the line, the characters of Toy Story became real to us.<br /><br />As we all relate to reaching out for someone to love and to be loved in return, it's the toys soul purpose and that makes Toy Story 3 all the more poigniant. 5 stars doesn't give Toy Story 3 justice. It has it all. Where most movies are trying not to be a waste of time, TOY STORY 3 and its predecessor's will be timeless. Toy Story 3 will be nominated for best picture this year and it may even be the first animated film to win. It's that good.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>Toy Story 3 seems to spell the final chapter in the saga of Andy's toy chest. Andy is now 17 and heading off the college. His Mom wants him to clear out his room before he goes -- anything that does not go with him or into the attic will keep trucked to the curb and out of his life forever. Obviously, this causes distress in his toy chest, whose denizens, while wildly loyal to Andy, have not been played with in years, and worry about what will happen to them. The movie spins out this drama believably and touchingly. The standard menagerie of Toy Story toys -- Woody, Buzz Lightyear, the slinky dog, Pig, and Dinosaur are all on hard. Along with a whole crew of nice and not-very-nice toys from a local daycare and at a local girl's house. And let's not forget to mention scene-stealing Barbie and Ken, with his enormous...wardrobe.<br /><br />Pixar has to be commended or taking an  old franchise and keeping it fresh.  There's enough danger, humor, genre allusions and prankishness for everyone to enjoy, old and young. The animation is firt rate. The work that went into Woody's loose-limbed gait was phenomenal. And some scenes that take place by the light of a glow-in-the-dark toy are breathtaking. The voicing was pitch-perfect, with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen reprising their old roles without irony or fatigue. Some of the film is dark and scary, with its overtones of prison movies, which might frighten the really little kids who won't understand what is going on. And the numerous "gay Ken" allusions were tiresome. I saw the film in 3D which did little to enhance the jaw-dropping animation, great voicing, terrific characters and superb plot.<br /><br />A brilliant film, entertaining, affecting, gorgeously crafted and respectful of itself and its audience.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I grew up with the original Toy Story movies, and now that I'm older, they still hold a special place in my heart. The 11 years was definitely worth the wait. This was an epic, and a great way to end the final story. Andy is going to college, and hasn't played with his toys in years. He plans on taking Woody, but leaving Buzz, Jessie, Hamm, Rex, Slinky, the aliens, & Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head in the attic. When the toys are accidentally thrown in the trash, they decide to go to Sunnyside Daycare. They are greeted by Lots-o-Huggin' Bear, aka Lotso. When Woody escapes the daycare, he is found by Bonnie and taken to her house. When Woody learns of Lotso's past, he decides to go back, and help his friends break out and get back to Andy before he goes away. It becomes very emotional toward the end, that I cried. It all comes down to this. I highly recommend TOY STORY 3!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A77184QJM3PM.html">A77184QJM3PM</a><br/><p>I have been looking forward to a third installment in the Toy Story series ever since the second film came out. The first two films were funny, endearing, and original masterpieces, and I could only hope and pray that A. they would make a third, and that B. it would be at least half as good as the first two. Well bless those geniuses at Pixar, they went for a third movie with our favs from the toy box, and they gave us a film that can proudly stand alongside the first two. Some of the original toys are missing in this one, and a moment near the beginning settles the fate of those missing toys, but the main characters are here, and most of them are freaking now that Andy is about to start college. Gloom, doom and despair, they're headed for the attic, or worse, the land-fill. Due to a mix-up, the toys find themsleves donated to a day-care, which is what you would think that toys would consider heaven. It turns out to be just the opposite, and that's when the interesting stuff really starts. The pace is kept tight, with only a slight drag here and there, with lots of adult nods and winks, and laughs galore. The animation is superb, as is usual with Pixar. I am of the very firm opinion that Pixar is the real and true home of the computer animated film, and all others are just wanna-bees ( yes, even the Shrek series). How Pixar continues to turn out quality film after quality film each and every time is amazing. As I said, the pace is good, and gets more intense towards the end. Actually, I noted several people squirmed a bit in a key part in the land-fill, so the intensity was a bit surprising. However, the ending was pure magic. There is a fine line between heavy-handed sentimentality and pulling the heart strings enough to get a reaction, and Pixar has it down pat. The ending is just right, and leaves the door open for a possible fourth film (which would be GREAT). All in all, this movie kind of surprised me. I knew I'd like it, but it was better than it had to be. That's another thing Pixar is good at.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>I am your twenty something viewer who grew up with Toy Story loving it. I was the one, among many, who felt, "finally, a movie that captures the wonder of a child!" The creativity was miraculous, and over the years we have had the sequel to relish in, as it was a true sequel, not a dissapointment. And, perhaps, we would allow Pixar room to make one "average" movie, but no, they create the masterpiece simply called Toy Story 3. Nothing fancy, that's it, and I can't think of any better way. The business side is done, here's all the hard work in the movie.<br /><br />And Toy Story 3 has some enviable characters once again. Andy has not suddenly become the monster that he had feared, or the spoiled brat of a teenager that does not grasp the humanity within. No, Andy has grown up to become Jesus in my eyes. I'll try not to give spoilers, He must be somehow aware that Woody and the gang have feelings, or else he has such a heart, that even toys, without soul, without life, he humanizes and treats with dignity. Imagine the good deads this young man will do that are left to our imaginations. I think people register this well and the altruism is felt.<br /><br />I would not rate this movie higher than Toy Story as it is more sentimental for me. I grew up with that film and Toy Story 3 is new. This is a kids movie and kids do seem to love Toy Story 3. But saying that, Kids like me have grown up since the first and are coming to see this and are also enjoying it. Toy Story 3 doesn't seem to have better graphics than the second, and I'm sure that's the point. It retains the style that we identify with.<br /><br />This is a movie, that so many will enjoy with flawless happiness and without fault. Not everyone will approach it as the innocent movie for a younger audience, and might hold it in an inappropriate light. Some might spite all the reasons that have been unanimous, because of the seemingly unreproachable Pixar having so little resistance to criticism. No matter though, I am confident that all will find this movie to be enjoyable on some level.<br /><br />Pixar can't be touched, not even by a few reviwers on Rotten Tomatoes with seeming vendettas. Awards are something special for the fans and for the talented cast and crew and I'm sure Toy Story 3 will reap in its harvast of gold statuettes. But I can't help but think now, that there was much more they could have done. I thought if would have been artistically rewarding to push the limits a little harder. I know they are being true to the spirit of Toy Story-with its simpleness, but I put forth that maybe a little experimentation such as a dream scene of the toys in which the creators could have had freedom to make something artistic.<br /><br />Note: I saw this on premier weekend at the theater of my town.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Toy Story 3 has Andy's toys trying to find a new place where they belong after Andy gets ready to go away to college. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), however hasn't given up on Andy and plans on going away with him. But Woody's toy friends need his help because their stay at a daycare center isn't the paradise they thought it would be. Can Woody help them escape and make it home in time to go with Andy ?<br /><br />  The movie is a very satisfying end, for the movies that is, there's going to be a short before Cars 2 I heard. So we'll still get to see the characters that we love. But Toy Story 3 still feels like farewell and it has a very emotional ending that's bound to make you cry happy tears. Pixar has done it again because so far Toy Story 3 is the best movie that I've seen this year. Just see it, but bring tissues!</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>What has always appealed to me about the "Toy Story" films, aside from the fantasy that toys are secretly able to speak, is that they add genuine emotion to scenarios real toys find themselves in. In the first movie, Woody the Cowboy was threatened by the arrival of Buzz Lightyear, a new, high tech toy that upstaged Woody's nostalgic charm. In the second movie, Woody faced the possibility of becoming a displayed collectable, to be gawked at instead of played with. Now we have "Toy Story 3," and it follows its predecessors by introducing another unfortunate reality: That of a child outgrowing his or her toys. What's to become of them then? Sometimes, they're stowed away in the attic for sentimental reasons. Sometimes, they're donated to charities or daycare centers. Sometimes, they're thrown away. In any case, it always seems to end badly for the toys.<br /><br />This is the situation that Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), Buzz (voiced by Tim Allen), and their toy pals find themselves in when their long-time owner, Andy (voiced by John Morris), prepares to move away from home, ready to start college. After a series of missteps and daring rescues, the toys wind up at a local daycare facility, which by all accounts seems like an ideal place. Plenty of children. No emotional attachment. Lots of other toys to befriend. But appearances can be deceiving; Woody's friends end up in the hands of aggressive toddlers, who are clearly too young to appreciate the value and delicacy of the toys they're given. Worse still is a tyrannical prison system overseen by the cuddly but heartless Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear (voiced by Ned Beatty). It's up to Woody, who was supposed to move to college with Andy, to rescue his friends before it's too late.<br /><br />While not quite at the level of their previous masterpieces "WALL-E" and "Up," "Toy Story 3" still proves that the folks at Pixar are the real deal, masters not only of computer animation but also of story, characterization, writing, and directing. It's not merely a bright and colorful series of images for kids to stare at in amazement; it's an emotional journey for people of all ages, correctly founded on the assumption that even adults remember what it was like to be young, carefree, and devoted to their toys. It's incredibly funny, but it's also incredibly exciting, and there are moments of such wonderful sweetness that they bypassed my brain and found their way directly to my heart. It doesn't play down to its audience - it's sincere in its efforts to be both entertaining and heartfelt. It's also in 3-D, although I must admit, I'm finding the process less and less necessary with every new release.<br /><br />Along with Lots-O', a number of other memorable characters are introduced. One of the best is Ken (voiced by Michael Keaton), both a direct reference to and a parody of the famous Mattel Ken doll. His footsteps are wooden and jerky, his joints limited in their flexibility. He lives in a spacious Dream House, and he flaunts a wardrobe-stuffed closet that even Carrie Bradshaw would be jealous of. He, of course, immediately falls for the newly-arrived Barbie (voiced by Jodie Benson), who's cute femininity belies a toughness that Ken would be hard pressed to outdo.<br /><br />And then there are the toys owned by the loveable Bonnie (voiced by Emily Hahn), who Woody meets entirely by accident. Mr. Pricklepants (voiced by Timothy Dalton) is a stuffed hedgehog who fancies himself a master thespian. Trixie (voiced by Kristen Schaal) is a blue triceratops who seems to be somewhat of a computer nerd. Buttercup (voiced by Jeff Garlin), a plush unicorn, finds Mr. Pricklepants annoying. Dolly (voiced by Bonnie Hunt), levelheaded and calm, is a ragdoll whose look must have been inspired by Raggedy Ann.<br /><br />Most of the characters we've come to love are part of this new story, including Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head (voiced by Don Rickles and Estelle Harris), Jessie (voiced by Joan Cusack), Hamm (voiced by John Ratzenberger), Rex (voiced by Wallace Shawn), and Slinky Dog (voiced by Blake Clark, replacing the late Jim Varney). Even after fifteen years of friendship, it's interesting to see the ways in which their camaraderie is tested. Take Buzz; when a switch on his back is tampered with, he reverts to his old self, once again believing he's an actual space pilot defending the galaxy from the evil Emperor Zurg. Attempts to fix him result in a hilarious language-setting malfunction, changing his voice - and his dancing moves - from English to Spanish.<br /><br />"Toy Story 3" could have easily gone wrong; sequels, especially those beyond the second chapter, are generally inferior, serving mostly as a way to continue marketing a franchise. Despite being the third in the series, this movie just as fun, just as charming, just as good-looking, and just as fresh as the original 1995 film. Should I have expected a different outcome? At this point, it's becoming less and less likely that Pixar will ever go wrong. The people there know how to make movies. More to the point, they know how to tell a story. They understand that even animated films deserve mature themes that adults can appreciate. They're technical wizards. Their creativity is second to none. What will they think of next? Something great, no doubt.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>My first son was just 2 1/2 years old when I got him the Toy Story / Toy Story 2 combo pack. I know this for sure because at the top of the Amazon Toy Story / Toy Story 2 combo pack product page it says, "You purchased this item on November 28, 2001." Wow...how time flies.<br /><br />So it was to my surprise that when my son, now 11, stayed home from school with a cold earlier this year, I found him watching Toy Story. He had just put the DVD in the player, so I sat with him for a second before I headed off to work. Then the second turned into a few minutes; then a few minutes turned into a nostalgic hour; which of course turned into, "What a great, classic movie, Dad; Let's watch Toy Story 2!" So I obliged. (I hope my boss isn't reading this.)<br /><br />I'd forgotten what classics Toy Story and Toy Story 2 are. And it turns out that Toy Story 3 is just as classic as the first two. Not only do these movies deserve just a viewing, they deserve to be added to your movie collection. Watched the Blu Ray version last night with the entire family, and had to buy the standard DVD today, because my 7 year old daughter insisted that she needs to be able to watch the movie several times...but "upstairs" where i don't have a Blu Ray player set up. No problem. I may be biased because of the strong emotional attachment that I found that I had and have renewed with these movies, but I say that all three Toy Story movies truly are collectors' items.<br /><br />While watching Toy Story 3 last night, just as when I watched the first two again earlier this year, I was laughing out loud, holding in the sobs and just plain enjoying perhaps the best animated movies ever to come out of Disney.<br /><br />The first is about Andy's (6 - 8 years old?) toys and what happens when Andy introduces his new Buzz Lightyear to the group of toys that he grew up with. But the toys better be sure to stay out of the hands of Andy's next door neighbor Sid, because Sid's idea of fun is toy torture! Then in Toy Story 2 it's spring cleanup time, and the toys better hide if they don't want to end up in the yard sale; especially if you're a rare toy and there are greedy toy collectors that would just love to have...er..I mean...sell you. Finally in Toy Story 3 Andy is all grown up and the Toys have to deal with wondering if Andy will take them to college (a bad bet), keep them in his room (probably not or....Donate them or....Throw them out in the trash?!?<br /><br />Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are once again magic together in Toy Story 3 and they are joined by a cast of many many A-list voice talents...Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head is my favorite (ya hockey puck!).<br /><br />And one more note, if you've ever seen the Buzz Lightyear <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004T2SJ">Disney Channel spinoff</a> but not the movies, don't be dissuaded by the spinoff because it was silly in comparison; the movies are head and shoulders above the spinoff in acting, animation and storywise.<br /><br />I'd grab the whole collection and see Toy Story 1 & 2 before 3 if you haven't already...it really puts things in perspective to watch it chronologically. Either way, get it into your cart then enjoy...with or without some kids!</p></br><a href="../users/ALLIGF5OZM1I6.html">ALLIGF5OZM1I6</a><br/><p>TOY STORY 3<br /><br />STARRING: The voices of: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Michael Keaton, Joan Cusack, Ned Beatty, Wallace Shawn, Don Rickles, Jodi Benson, Blake Clarke, John Ratzenberger, Estelle Harris and Laurie Metcalf<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: John Lasseter, Lee Unkrich, Andrew Stanton and Michael Arndt<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Lee Unkrich<br /><br />Rated: G<br />Genre: Animation / Comedy<br />Release Date: 18 June 2010<br />Review Date: 21 September 2010<br /><br />I was only 11-years-old when Toy Story hit theaters back in 1995, and to this day it remains my all-time favorite animated film. It changed the face of animation forever and graced us with some of the warmest characters we've ever known. Toy Story 3 brings all those fond memories and adventures back home for us, once more.<br /><br />Woody (Tom Hanks) and Buzz (Time Allen) are still the personal toys of their beloved child, Andy. But Andy is all grown up, and off to college. Whatever is to happen to Woody and the gang? Only a select group of the toys we met in the original film remain in Andy's long forgotten toy box, which is brilliantly realistic, and they are all begging to be played with.<br /><br />When a final excruciatingly, disappointing attempt to gain Andy's attention and affection fails them; the toys begin to accept that they are no longer needed, and this crushes their spirits. It soon becomes blindingly obvious that their near future will be coursed down one of only three lonely and unfamiliar roads: leading them either to the attic, the garbage, or as donations to a daycare.<br /><br />Much to everyone's surprise, including Woody's - Woody finds himself the only toy in which Andy has chosen to take to college. The rest of them wind up by mistake, in a box designated the `daycare' box, by Andy's mom. Woody adds himself to this donation parcel, in hopes of springing everyone free from the no doubt horrible daycare, first chance he gets.<br /><br />Everyone but Woody seems pretty fond of the idea of daycare. And why shouldn't they? None of them were selected to go to college with Andy. The idea of new children in tempered with their youth wanting to play with all of them, is as good as paradise. So Woody leaves them behind to go with Andy.<br /><br />Ned Beatty joins the franchise as the voice of Lotso; a bright pink Teddy Bear at the day care, who's child abandoned him. Lotso is head of a gang of toys new to us, to include a Ken doll voiced by none other, than Michael Keaton!<br /><br />Somehow, Disney and Pixar have taken their divine talents in animation to yet another level here, and Toy Story 3 is neck and neck with Despicable Me for my pick for best animated feature of the year. I was expecting to have fun this time around, but feared the formula would become tiresome and the jokes would be recycled from the first two installments. This is not the case. From the hilarious action-packed opening, to the tear jerking finale, Toy Story 3 was one of the best cinematic adventures of the year!<br /><br />At one point Buzz has his voice-pack changed to a Spanish setting and at another Mrs. Potato-Head is able to see with her missing eye left while it's left back in Andy's room. Oh, and Mr. Potato Head has to improvise by using leftover lunch items to substitute for his plastic body when it's otherwise indisposed! These are just a few of the many hilarious moments the movie offers.<br /><br />Toy Story 3 is a treat for kids, no doubt. But it will offer them some insight on their feelings about life, and their relationships with the people in their lives, in addition to just entertaining them. It's a cartoon, sure - but it's written very well and it's gushing with moral substance; enough for kids and adults to both indulge in. You won't find that in too many children's films. And let's not forget the amazingly talented cast this franchise has in tow.<br /><br />What I appreciated most about Toy Story 3, that the first two lacked, was the amount of emotion we spill for these characters. We were getting to know them the first two times around, but as I mentioned early on; now - much like Andy, we've grown up with them.  Seeing them left behind by Andy, and the brilliant ending - ripped me apart. We really care about these characters by the end of the film, and we've enjoyed the hours we've shared with them over the years. But in due time, I suppose we all have to put away childish things. It's a shame, though.</p></br><a href="../users/A239PPUVV8O0U0.html">A239PPUVV8O0U0</a><br/><p>Hard to believe a movie about toys made me feel emotional but that's the strength of the story this movie has! And I haven't felt that way for a long time when I've seen a new film. I may have felt sad or felt an connection to a character before but I've never actually cried (except in Titanic but that's because it was a bad movie, not because it was emotional). Most of the main cast returns except for the late Jim Varney (Slinky) and Joe Ranft (Lenny and Wheezy). While Wheezy, Bo Peep, RC and most of the other toys are gone, Blake Clark takes over as the voice of Slinky, which works just fine for me. If I hadn't known about Varney's death, I never would've caught the difference. New actors include Ned Beatty, Michael Keaton, Timothy Dalton, Whoopi Goldberg and Bonnie Hunt. The animation is brilliant, consistent with the two other films. The story is actually well put together, as I mentioned. The toys (what ones are left), having had the benefit of two films to be developed, are a close-knit family who don't want to be thrown away now that Andy is on his way to college. The toys wind up at a daycare where they are practically torn up. I won't go into too many details but the film has a "Great Escape" feel and near the climax is where I started to get teary eyed. One of the few films to be a "3" and still be consistent in the story and development of what previous films had. A far better "3" movie than Spider-Man, Batman (Forever), Superman, Shrek, Star Trek, Pirates of the Carribean (I can't think of anymore). Go see it, its a perfect end to a good trilogy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I have seen 22 movies in theaters so far this year, but out of that bunch, only Toy Story 3 deserves a 5 star rating. Yeah, it's really been a lackluster year.<br /><br />The animation and voice acting are top notch as always, but Pixar never fails in the most important part of a movie, the script. Sure a movie can look pretty and all, but it's the writing that has always elevated Pixar above other animation studios. How to Train Your Dragon was a very good effort from Dreamworks this year, but watching Toy Story 3 today just confirmed how far they still have to go.<br /><br />I will agree with the claim that most critics are making by saying that this is one of the best movie trilogies of all time. Other than the first three films of Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Lord of the Rings, I can't think of any others more consistently great. Toy Story 3 is just as good as 1 and 2, but it goes into some darker territory than the previous two, so much so, I would say this is geared more for adults than kids. Don't let that fool you, there are more than enough clever lines and visual gags to keep you laughting, as well as, some great action sequences. I loved the whole prison break out of the daycare part, and the last five minutes or so couldn't have been any more perfect, leaving you wiping away happy and sad tears at the same time.<br /><br />In the end, we are left with a beautifully wrapped up conclusion to a series of movies that will be treasured for infinity and beyond.<br /><br />I didn't see the movie in 3-D since I heard it wasn't worth the extra money. Judging from the trailers I saw before the movie started, everyone is rushing to tack on 3-D at the last minute. Only Avatar and How to Train Your Dragon had the impact of actually being filmed that way to begin with.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ICW5OUWX2A2V.html">A2ICW5OUWX2A2V</a><br/><p>In the film world, a trilogy can be a good thing, a chance to tell a long story over three parts, enabling us to become emotionally attached to the characters and the world they live in. Unfortunately however, many times the third film in the series can be tired and worn out, the result of the creativity and spark dying out long before the cameras roll.<br /><br />Thankfully however, that's not the case with Toy Story 3, which is the perfect ending to the series, and a moving and emotional one at that.<br /><br />Picking up several years after the end of its predecessor, Toy Story 3 finds Andy, now 18, packing up and heading off to college. Woody, Buzz, and all his old toys now spend their time in a toy box, essentially forgotten. When told that he either has to store them in the attic, throw them out, or donate them to a daycare center, Andy sets events in motion that will lead to what is essentially judgment day for Woody and the gang...the fact that Andy has outgrown them, and that they are essentially, in Andy's words, junk, facing an uncertain future.<br /><br />Of all of Pixar's movies, it's my opinion that Toy Story 3 is by far the most emotional. While a simple story about the toys we all know so well, it tackles the issue of mortality. Unlike what Randy Newman's famous, "You've Got A Friend in Me" song says, friendships do die. Relationships drift apart, and life changes, and not always for the better. And it's here that Toy Story 3 shines. It may not have the most action of the series (Film 2 holds that honor), but it does have the most heart, as it follows the toys we all know and love as they struggle to find their place in a frightening world where they could be thrown out, discarded, and destroyed at any time. This is a film about loss, the ending of relationships, and the fact that nothing lasts forever.  Nowhere is this more apparent then the film's final act, which is the most dramatic of the entire series (and without question, Pixar's greatest drama scenes), and concludes with an ending that had me in tears, and at some points, sobbing.<br /><br />It's always hard to see great things coming to an end. I've grown up with these characters, having seen the first film in grade school, and now seeing the gang's final adventure shortly after graduating from college. But, as cheesy at it sounds, it's a relationship I'll always treasure, and will be grateful for enjoying. As Buzz says early in the film, it's best to go out on a high note, and Toy Story 3 accomplishes it with ease. In my opinion, it's Pixar's most emotional film, and their most bittersweet...but even through the tears, you'll walk out with a smile.</p></br></body></html>

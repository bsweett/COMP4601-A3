Lots of crap blows up, plenty of rah-rah guy patriotism, new oddball sidekick, oily villain, and plenty of corny wisecracks from the mouth of John McClane. It's amazingly fast paced and a few of the stunts were wildly inventive (although the main ones are in the trailer). There's even a scene stealing cameo from Kevin Smith, playing the King Warlock of All Hackers.<br /><br />The plot: Timothy Olyphant as a disgruntled ex-Fed out for revenge (and cash) against an inept Homeland Security that threw him out in disgrace after he kept insisting their computer system could be easily compromised. He secretly recruits a bunch of Uber-Nerds to crack - one by one - different security codes and then eliminates the hackers. Olyphant's Thomas Gabriel then sets about gleefully causing anarchy as the Government is exposed as inept and unprepared. It's up to McClane and Matt, the last surviving Super Nerd (Justin Long), to outwit, outlast and outhack Olyphant and his evil-doers.<br /><br />That's the good. The bad is the usual hokiness (Olyphant's villain is totally without depth) and the overall implausibility of things (a stealth fighter plane being repeatedly unable to hit its target?). After three movies of not having children, John McClane suddenly has a daughter, Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). She finds herself in the kind of ridiculous sub-plot peril that Elisha Cuthbert would stink up episodes of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008YGRU">'24'</a> with. There are a few nit-picky factual errors (there are no Yellow Cabs in DC, for instance), but that is something you'd only know if you were from there.<br /><br />Overall, "Live Free Or Die Hard" runs its course with more flair than most, due primarily to Willis' memorable go at McClane. To the filmakers' credit, they didn't try to make him young again, which would have been a mistake. Other than the Lucy Subplot, everything stays on course, delivered with just enough suspense and humor to make it an enjoyable, better than average actioner.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>Bruce Willis returns as Detective John McClane in "Live Free or Die Hard," the fourth film in the "Die Hard" film franchise! In this film, McClane faces his toughest challenge yet when he takes on a group of cyber-terrorists hell-bent on shutting down the American infrastructure. But 21st Century villains are about to get a taste of 20th Century justice! The film features some fantastic action sequences, and the plot is great, if a tad predictable.<br />As far as acting goes, it's good overall. Willis, as usual, is great as McClane. He maybe a few years older, but he can still unload a can of whoop-#*$ on the bad guys, and is still good with the wise-cracks. Justin Long is also good as Matt Farrell, a computer hacker, and McClane's side-kick in the film. Sadly, Timothy Olyphant and Maggie Q, two respectable actors, are given one-dimensional villains to play, though they do the best with what they got to work with. And Kevin Smith makes a memorable, if frustratingly short, appearance as one of Farrell's fellow hackers.<br />This is definitely one of the best films in the series. Despite some flaws, this is a terrific film that "Die Hard" fans will surely enjoy!<br />Movie/DVD Grade: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>The original Diehard was a groundbreaking movie. It featured an breakout performance by Bruce Willis, it had great action, a fun plot, and a romantic twist. Diehard had two unique characteristics that I believe made the first two films so successful, and hindered the third in the series. First, there was a problem only John McClain could solve. In the skyscraper, and then in the airport, the police, FBI and military were on the scene, but for whatever reason, only John McClain could be the hero. If it wasn't for McClain, the bad guys would win. Second, McClain was motivated by love. In the first film, his wife was being held hostage, in the second, she was in a jet that was about to run out of fuel. McClain acted not only to save others, but to save his wife. The third Die Hard abandoned both of those plot points and wasn't as good because of it.<br /><br />Live Free or Die Hard is out some 13 years after the third movie. Willis still looks great. The action is great. The dialogue (in the unrated version) is what you'd expect. The movie opens with McClain being asked to escort a computer hacker to the FBI for questioning. McClain shows up and must immediately fight off heavily armed thugs. From there on, its action scene after action scene as McClain and the hacker (played by Justin Long) must avoid the bad guys. The bad guys, led by Timothy Oliphant have shut down the entire East Coast. They've disrupted traffic lights, trains, Wall Street, and power grids. No one knows what is going on. Except perhaps John McCain, who is sitll escorting the hacker that just might have a clue as to what is going on, and how to stop it. This movie succeeds because McClain is once again forced to be the hero.<br /><br />While the FBI and Homeland Security have to deal with the larger problems of the entire computer systems of the country being disrupted, McClain has the advantage of being with a guy that might just know what was going on. McClain charges on, never one to stop and wait for help. The movie sets up action scenes after action scenes, and after awhile they become repetitive. Even so, they do actually get better and better. McClain's daughter Lucy, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, substitutes for the wife as the damsel in distress McClain must save. Having to save his daughter adds just enough of emotion and depth to counter all of the non-stop testosterone.<br /><br />This movie won't go down as one of the best ever. How can it when it is the fourth in the series? But it features one of the best action heroes of the last twenty years showing that he is still on top of his games. Justin Long is solid as the wise cracking computer hacker that is with Willis for the ENTIRE movie. Oliphant is menancing as a bad guy even if his motivation isn't clear until the end. The rest of the cast doesn't make an impression. Fans of Die Hard and Willis should enjoy this movie. It is fun, fast-paced and violent.</p></br><a href="../users/AY46DEOJJYFTW.html">AY46DEOJJYFTW</a><br/><p>I will never forget the experience of sitting in the movies and seeing "DIE HARD" , the original, for the first time. It was unlike anything I had seen before as far as non-stop action, great characters and an explosive story. The hero, Bruce Willis, was a wise-cracking, NYPD officer with more guts then brains and the villain, Alan Rickman, was the greatest villain since Jesse James. Well, the years passed on, other films took on the non-stop action sequences rarely as exciting or as well-done as DIE HARD. All the heroes took on the wise-cracking, lovable, tough guy hero. But rarely did any of them approach the fun or intent of DIE HARD. So I took a passing interest in the DIE HARD sequels and recently watched LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD. Well, the beginning was very promising, a story that pulled me in and kept me on the edge of my seat but somewhere about 2/3rds of way through the film it started to lose me. I know it's a DIE HARD film franchise and a DIE HARD film must<br />always try to outdo itself with the explosions and killing and making Bruce Willis look invincible but c'mon they had a really good film going here and it just peters out. The action became too unbelievable, the explosions too unnecessary and the whole story line seemed to fall apart so as we can have one more chase or one more explosion. Hey, you know what you're getting when you watch anything in the DIE HARD series but since when does making a good film take a back seat to entertainment, I though a good film would be more entertaining then mindless action. Also John McClain has gone from regular Joe to some kind of superhero. Maybe, it's just been too long and my tastes have changed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>12 Years after Die Hard with a Vengeance McClane is back and he has a teenage daughter who calls him John and simply doesn't want to know. John hasn't seen any action since him and his old partner Zeus took down the New York bomber Simon Gruber. Now seems like the right time to get back in action and kick some major terrorist booty, only this time he needs the help of a computer geek. Ex-government official turned cyber terrorist aims to get revenge on the government that refused to listen to him and bring them to their knees. He employs a group of hackers to build a program for him which will help him take down the entire US networks, including Utilities, Traffic & defence. Once the program is built, the terrorist and his small team have no need for these small time hackers so by turning their hard drives into bombs he goes about executing every one of them. Unfortunately for him one of the hackers is being brought in by John McClane for suspicion of breaking into the FBI networks. The bomb goes off with McClane and the hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long) inside, they don't die but now John is in the action and from that minute you know the big guy is back. He fires off a quick one liner after the explosion which makes you tingle with excitement as you remember the good old' days. "I hope that didn't wake the neighbours."<br />After the gun toting battle McClane and Farrell get out of the apartment building and proceed to go on the run, but although McClane has the intention of just dropping off Farrell at the station he is now pulled into this world of cyber terror.<br /><br />Bruce Willis has always been perfect for this role, and although people had their doubts about whether he could pull off the McClane character 12 years after the last film, he surely put their doubts to rest.<br />When we first meet Justin Long as the Cyber Hacker (Matt Farrell) it seems from the very first scene that you know he's going to be perfect for the role. He gives off this aura that he's someone who's not familiar with the world outside of his apartment, and becomes completely on edge when he first meets McClane. The relationship between both McClane and Farrell starts off the way it was meant to be is that Farrell is the criminal being brought in by the cop. This relationship develops through each scene and you see quite a clich&eacute; image of the technically wise kid teaching the slow old man about computers. It's not a bad thing, as the chemistry between the two really works and develops into what can only be described as a father/son relationship. Between the two characters a subtle side plot begins to develop as it gives us a clash of cultures story. Farrell teaches McClane about the world of computers and how they play a major part in the lives of everyone, and McClane teaches Farrell of the importance of putting his life on the line for his country and his family.<br />Justin Long and Timothy Olyphant are two very small time actors but acting alongside Willis in this film series can really put their names up in lights and build their careers. The character of Thomas Gabriel is a man who loved his country and after 9/11 he tried to warn the government how vulnerable their defence networks were. The government dismissed the claims and this effectively destroyed his career. He became angry and vengeful and decided to instil upon the U.S. government what's known as a fire sail which is a 3 stage program that can destroy the United States networks.<br /><br />The action is very much non-stop and quite reminiscent; more of the 3rd Die Hard movie rather than the first two. It's over the top and it's very much on a larger scale when compared to the other films in the series. An example of this is the scene in the tunnel when Gabriel directs all traffic towards McClane and Farrell under the tunnel. The number of cars that are smashed up and flung towards the two in an over the top fashion is insane. The CGI although used quite minimally is used in an intelligent manner and only used for when a live action sequence is simply impossible. Dare I say that this film brinks of the level of possibly being better than the first Die Hard film. The action is superb, the acting and chemistry amongst the actors is something special and something that a fan of cinema can truly appreciate.<br />Although this was a film based entirely on fiction, one has to wonder about the true possibilities of such events that took place in this film. Our governments will have us reassured that our networks are secure and impenetrable, yet time and time again we hear stories of how teenagers hack into what we're told as the most secure systems in the world. The possibility of a fire sail which is talked about in the movie is something which is possible in reality and that is something which I think gives the bigger impact in our minds and makes this all the more believable.<br /><br />Willis brings us the nostalgia effect in this film as we remember the man who had what we could call at least a marginal head of hair and he brings back the enthusiasm that he has for his country no matter how bad the pay is.<br /><br />Justin Long brings us the typical image of how we see today's young adult.  He has this disrespectful immaturity, yet this childish vulnerability that we come to adore with this character as he demands the constant protection of McClane but builds his self confidence after he is faced with difficult situation after difficult situation.<br /><br />Timothy Olyphant I feel is the star of this show as he creates a believable character who is as patriotic as McClane yet wants revenge against a government that betrayed him. He gives off this disgruntled insecure individual who started off simply wanting to prove a point but dug himself into a hole he can't get out of.<br /><br />This is easily one of the best films I've seen in a long time and I'm glad it's a Die Hard sequel as I would hate to be giving it a 1 star and telling everyone how terrible I thought this film was. The action was full on and non-stop and this was mixed with believable characters and a storyline that matches with today's fears of terrorism.<br /><br />I truly loved this film and have loved the past films in the series and this is the reason why this has been my longest review to date.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LSDDSM4PGOU5.html">A1LSDDSM4PGOU5</a><br/><p>this ,the 4th installment of the Die hard franchise is easily the most<br />thrilling and action packed.however,logic and reality are thrown out<br />the window for the action scenes.if you like your action with a little<br />bit of realty and logic,you won't like this movie.but for me,the movie<br />was so fun,i didn't care.but beyond being just a slam bang action<br />thrill ride it's also very relevant and thought provoking.if the<br />technology that society almost totally depend on were to completely<br />crash,how would you react,and hoe would the general public react.this<br />movie gives one hypothetical example of the answer to that<br />question.it's great to see this installment is geared more towards our<br />techno savvy contemporary audience.but it's also still great for<br />audiences that grew up with the franchise. not only is this a thrilling<br />and thought provoking movie,but it's also very funny,possibly the<br />funniest of all four movies.for me,Live Free or Die Hard is a perfect<br />5/5 for sheer excitement alone.the rest is just gravy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>You would need a pretty good team in place to justify a fourth film in a franchise that hasn't had a new entry in 13 years, and boy, do they ever have one here with director Len Wiseman at the helm.  There's nothing groundbreaking about it; rather, it's a throwback to the action films of the 80's.  Once again, Bruce Willis as John McClane pulls off stunts that would do Captain America proud but with plenty of bruises and blood stains to show for it.  The plot concerns a computer terrorist who has seized control of the United States infrastructure and once it gets going, it's non-stop action from start to finish.  I'm not sure what sets this film apart from so many other action films that just become tiresome before the final explosions detonate, but I found it to be a hugely entertaining adrenaline rush and a more fitting send-off to this character than the tepid "Die Hard with a Vengeance."</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This was a good installment in the series.  Willis is getting a bit old for the action star, but he carries himself well in the picture.  Justin Long does well as a comedic side kick.  The story is tailored for modern times by having cyber criminals being the baddies.  The main criminal is a little one dimensional and bland, but the action of the film more than makes up for it.  The unrated version is the way to go with ramped up swearing and action.  If they could make another the quality of this picture, I would certainly go see a part 5.  This is a worthy film to add to your other 3.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYRTQ04LYI55.html">A1CYRTQ04LYI55</a><br/><p>The most over the top of the Die Hard movies - this contains the most unrealistic stunts, the most convoluted plot, and the least believable turns of events - basically everything we've come to see in a Die Hard movie.<br /><br />The plot (terrorists taking about the electric, electronic and transportation infrastucture, at first appearing idealistice but ultimately in it for the money) doesn't really hold to logic, but it isn't meant to be.  For a movie like this, it's just an excuse to link chase scenes and gunfights together.<br /><br />Bruce Willis sometimes comes off as "the guy from Shield" in this movie - though it's arguable which was the chicken and which the egg.  The supporting cast had some interesting choices:  "The Apple Guy" makes an appearance as a hacker, Kevin Smith plays a very convincing uber-hacker and Maggie Q leverages her HK action credentials as a Kung Fu fighting computer hacker.  (Apologies for the repeated use of "Hacker" but this is the most technophobic flick since War Games!)<br /><br />Not a "Must See" movie by any event, but if you liked the style of the first three Die Hard films, this is certainly up that alley.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Here's some cool trivia:<br /><br />The original 1988 Die Hard is based on a 1979 novel by Roderick Thorp titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345287819">Nothing Lasts Forever</a>, which was a sequel to Thorp's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385294697">The Detective</a> that was made into the movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007PALXE">The Detective</a> starring Frank Sinatra in 1968. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000244EMO">Predator</a> Director John McTiernan directed Die Hard.<br /><br />In Die Hard, Hans Gruber is played by Alan Rickman, now more famous for his role as Servious Snape in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W4B8NC">Harry Potter series</a>. Rickman and Jeremy Irons, in my opinion, could easily be confused with each other...especially when they're heavily costumed.<br /><br />Die Hard 2 was based on the book titled 58 Minutes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812510038">58 Minutes</a> by Walter Wager. The plane crash at the beginning of the movie is consisdered one of the most horrific ever filmed (according to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000T8XYOW">Maxim</a>).<br /><br />Die Hard 3 has John McTiernan back in the director's seat, and DH3 is the only one of the four to have been written by a screenwriter. It stars Alan-Rickman-act-alike Jeremy Irons as 'the bad guy'.<br /><br />Die Hard 4 is based on a May 1997 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005N7TL">Wired</a> article by John Carlin. DH4 is directed by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TGJ80I">Underworld</a> series master Len Wiseman and stars that dude (Justin Long) who's more popular from his stint in the recent Apple Computer commercials than his past acting roles.<br /><br />The Blu Ray compilation of all four films is a great package. Chances are that you're here (like I was) because you've already seen the first three, and you're wondering if it's worth it to buy the entire collection in order to get the 4th? I'll say this: the fourth (Live Free or Die Hard) stands out as one of the best, if not the best, of the series. So if you've always wanted the Die Hard series in your collection, go with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W4HIY0">Die Hard Collection</a>.<br /><br />Like the previous 3 movies, in Live Free or Die Hard John McClane (Bruce Willis) is seemingly indestructable, surviving death defying feat after death defying feat. Willis' banter with costar Long is witty and funnier than anything from the first three movies combined. The action is non-stop, and the supporting cast is fabulous (especially <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O5B4BU">Deadwood's</a> Timothy Olyphant).<br /><br />Add the collection to your cart or Die Hard.</p></br><a href="../users/A22VNXHU6IZ5MT.html">A22VNXHU6IZ5MT</a><br/><p>This is one great Blue Ray title,yes it's the original PG-13 Version that was originally shown at theaters,but it's a great film with action-a-plenty,great acting and a great storyline!!!

Almost twenty years after he single handedly (and barefooted) stood up against the group of ruthless international terrorists that held hostages, including John McClane's wife, Holly, in a Los Angeles skyscraper on one Christmas night, New York cop, tough guy John McClane is back. In the fourth "Die Hard" movie, McClane faces the biggest challenge of his career and the stakes are unbelievably high. In the first "Die Hard", the bad guys took over the building, in the second film, McClane was against a team of terrorists, led by Col. Stuart (Sadler) who was holding the entire airport hostage. In the third one a man calling himself "Simon" (Jeremy Irons) threatened to detonate bombs around New York City unless Detective John McClane cooperated in a game of "Simon Says". In the latest "Die Hard" installment,  low-tech McClane("You're a Timex watch in a digital age", he's been told) is up against a ring of highly intelligent and dangerous Internet techno-terrorists who are very close to taking control of America's computer infrastructure, breaking in and shutting down all the networks, creating havoc and panic around the country in "fire sale". As the young hacker who happened to be on of the terrorists targets, explains, "It's a three-step... it's a three-step systematic attack on the entire national infrastructure. Okay, step one: take out all the transportation. Step two: the financial base and telecoms. Step three: You get rid of all the utilities. Gas, water, electric, nuclear. Pretty much anything that's run by computers which... which today is almost everything. So that's why they call it a fire sale, because everything must go."<br /><br />Technical terrorists-geniuses thoroughly thought through every possible small detail of the vicious fire sale attack but they did not include in their plan one variable,  sarcastic, cynical, disappointed and wise cracking Detective John McClane who now works for Homeland Security. I loved the movie. It is a very decent entry in the "Die Hard" series. It is creative, the fights and explosions are spectacular, and the action sequences are full of adrenalin. John McClane is older, that's true but nothing can slow him down, and certainly not his age. When he is on the screen saving the day, his daughter, and  his  country, I know he would get every one of the bad guys, and I hope that he will be back - for another "Die Hard"  movie.<br /><br />"Live Free or Die Hard" is the first movie I've seen on Blue-Ray disk and I was very impressed by the quality of the picture and the sound. Since I have not seen it in the theater, it is the next best thing. :)</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGB4HN3QCGAL.html">A3DGB4HN3QCGAL</a><br/><p>As round four in the Die Hard Series Live Free or Die Hard has the same general mix of bad guys with their evil plot never quite what it seems (and it's really always about money), the outlandish action scenes and super cop (McClane) who never seems to stop going no matter how much he gets hurt. I actually think the plots are fairly plausible, however unlikely, and pretty well thought out- the movies have all been fun to watch, this one is no different.<br /><br />I watched the unrated version and had no complaints except to say that I never found the music video and commentary that are listed as being on the DVD, where are they? One commentary that I didn't try out- no other extras at all, not even a chapter list or behind the scenes mini feature. Just a little more stuff would have helped make the movie an even better value.</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>Every week i read that other countries are always trying to hack in our<br />systems...why not...by electronically controlling a country you can bring<br />it down to its knees pretty fast..

Closest in spirit to the previous three films, the unrated version is more cohesive, funnier, and less PC than the 'cleaned-up' theatrical edition...but if you prefer PC, this edition offers the option of BOTH versions to choose from!<br /><br />Willis' 'John McClane' is the most likable of the action heroes introduced during the testosterone-driven 1980s, an honest cop unwillingly caught in the middle of brilliantly-conceived schemes of criminal masterminds, defeating them by outlasting them, physically, while tossing off some of the funniest one-liners you'll ever hear on screen. It's a formula ideally suited to Willis, and the latest installment, created by filmmakers who grew up on the original trilogy, succeeds in keeping things 'fresh' by raising the stakes, and playing up McClane as a 'dinosaur' in a high-tech world.<br /><br />The plot involves the shutting down of not a building, airport, or city, but the entire country (to steal billions of dollars...as McClane quips, "It's always about money"), and, aided by a pacifist computer geek (Justin Long), and his uber-hacker buddy (a very funny Kevin Smith, in a welcome cameo), Willis is ready to abuse his body again, to save the day!<br /><br />While the film's villain (Timothy Olyphant) lacks the urbane villainy of Alan Rickman or sophisticated panache of Jeremy Irons, his second-in-command (Maggie Q), is the sexiest opponent Willis has faced, yet, and the action sequences (done mostly 'live' rather than by CGI), are truly astonishing (particularly Willis 'taking on' a fighter jet in an 18-wheeler...you have to see it to believe it!)<br /><br />The 'Special Features' ARE special, as well; my favorite is an interview between Willis and unabashed "Die Hard" fan Kevin Smith, which manages to be both insightful and funny.<br /><br />Yippee-ki-ay INDEED!</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>'Live Free or Die Hard', number IV in the 'Die Hard' series revisits the basic outline of the first film only in a much more grandiose stlye expanding beyond the confines of one high rise building to encompass the entire eastern seaboard. Bruce Willis reprises his signature role as police detective John McClane and does a fantastic job breathing new life into this now iconic character.<br /><br />Following in the footsteps of another iconic prototype established in the first film, Timothy Olyphant does a superior job as the Alan Rickman-ish, highly intelligent villian as does Justin Long as computer hacker/sidekick to Detective McClane.. Then of course lets not forget the enchanting Maggie Q, sigh...<br /><br />The action is fast and furious, the cast excellent and the dialogue witty especially Justin Longs lines). The only thing keeping this film from a five star rating is the sequence with the jet fighter which was a little too unbelievable for me.<br /><br />My Rating: -4 1/2 Stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NYQCLFQRTI74.html">A2NYQCLFQRTI74</a><br/><p>John McClane (Bruce Willis) is back.

The Die Hard saga really hasn't had a bad movie yet, unless you don't like the second very much. In any case, it even seems that the future may be brighter than ever. Especially with big production companies more willing than ever to finance remakes, and continuing franchise movies, like Die Hard. They hit gold by casting the face of Apple, Justin Long, who has the keys to our generations humor. He is the embodiment of sarcasm that typifies the younger generation. And seeing him with old timer Bruce Willis, really makes some relieving humor to go along with the trademark, impossible action sequences.<br /><br />When watching a Die Hard movie, you overlook, otherwise serious movie action goofs, such as taking out a helicopter with a car, because that's the ticket you bought. It worked in every Die Hard, and you would be someone who just doesn't get it if you started picking out all the head scratchers in this movie.<br /><br />I like two summer movies (so far) and the other is the Simpsons. And if you look at the date I review each, they're both on the same date. What an awesome day it was too! I really like the non computer graphics. It makes me feel like they put alot of hard physical work into, no offence to those hard working computer programers though. The four people I saw this with all commented on how good this cast was together. Me personally, I agree, but Bruce Willis is so awesome that I wouldn't care if they casted Ben Afflick in this! i'd still really be cheering the whole way. Is there anyone else in Hollywood today who can deliver corny one,two liners and get away with it like Bruce Willis?

Willis back and tougher than ever.<br /><br />And the action is practically non-stop, with one big stunt sequence after another. Midway through the film I was wondering how they would top the last big explosion, but the screenwriter never ran out of even more dangerous stunts to come. This has got to be one of the most physically demanding roles Willis (and his stuntman) ever played.<br /><br />Amid all the tension there's a nice sense of humor going on between Willis and his young Hacker friend (JUSTIN LONG), with the banter never missing a clever exchange of lines as they join forces to fight the villain out to destroy America. At the end, of course, there's plenty of guts and glory for both of them who manage to survive all the attempts to destroy them at terrific odds.<br /><br />While preposterous, the screenplay does make you think twice about what might happen if our dependence on computers went totally haywire. It's this aspect of the story that gives it that much needed adrenalin rush for today's movie fans.<br /><br />Summing up: The franchise is alive and kicking with some astonishing action stunts and some really better than average work from Willis and his sidekick Long. A welcome summer blockbuster.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>What a great treat!  I always loved those Die Hard movies (in fact, it's dangerous for me to channel surf if one of them is on TV) and was thrilled when Live Free actually happened.  The story, action, fx, acting, attitude are all there in spades.  Some things are worth revisting when they're done well.  This does not dissapoint.  A reason to actually drag your tired [...] to the movies and pay to watch commercials!!  Can't wait for the dvd.</p></br><a href="../users/APIW11UEPKIC2.html">APIW11UEPKIC2</a><br/><p>Bruce Willis is back as John McClane and ready to battle it out with more terrorists. Hackers plan to shut off the country's power supply so they can get into everyones bank accounts. Timothy Olyphant is good as the main villain, but by the end I was a little tired of him. He is sort of weak, but luckily his henchwoman played by Maggie Q isn't. She is not a martial arts actress whatsoever, but still looks great throwing Bruce Willis around. Cyril Raffaelli is Olyphant's other main henchman, and he gets to show off his amazing athletic skills in a good short fight with Willis. Willis does fine in the fight scenes. Not pretty, but he gets the job done.<br /><br />The comedy is good for the most part, and the whole movie is enjoyable. Halfway through I started wondering if the action was gonna pick up a little bit, and I ended up getting more than I asked for. The action gets so crazy that I had to sneak back in and watch it all again.<br /><br />4/5</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>Despite the fact that Bruce Willis is the same character is ALL his film-we return to the main one that made him infamous in the late 80's and the same formula still works.  When we first meet John having an argument with his daughter, I'm instantly reminded of the similuarity of the scene of that of The Last Boy Scout.  How McClaine is still just some cop and not the mayor or some high ranking politician with his record of heroics is amazing within itself or heck, let's send him to the middle east and let him win the war for us.  The man should be able to win the thing within 24 hours.  My point is NOTHING is believable in this and at least 3 of the films in this franchise-BUT damn if you can turn away from it.  There is something about Bruce that speaks to the hero in all of us.  We want to be that bad MF who has a sarcastic quip for every and all situations. McClaine is like Cher and cockroaches, you can't get rid of him and he damn sure won't go away.  Overall, this series still has what it takes to thrill you.  Come on movie number 5.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Live Free Or Die Hard" is excellent! The cast led by Bruce Willis (returning to the role that made him famous, John McClane) is excellent. The directing by Len Wiseman (who also directed "Underworld" (2003) & its sequel, "Underworld: Evolution" (2006) is excellent. The story by Mark Bomback (who wrote the story and screenplay to "Godsend" (2004) & David Marconi (who also wrote the story to "Enemy Of The State" (1998) and the screenplay by Bomback is excellent. The music by Marco Beltrami (who also did the music to "Underworld: Evolution" and the upcoming "3:10 To Yuma" (2007) is excellent. The cinematography by Simon Duggan (who also did the cinematography to "Underworld: Evolution" & the upcoming "The Mummy 3" (2008) is excellent. The film editing by Nicolas De Toth (who also did the film editing to "Underworld: Evolution") is excellent. The casting by Deborah Aquila & Mary Tricia Wood (both who also did the casting to "Underworld: Evolution" & most recently, "Evan Almighty" (2007) is excellent. The production design by Patrick Tatopoulos (who also did the production design to "Underworld: Evolution") is excellent. The art direction by Beat Frutiger (who also did the art direction to "Transformers" (2007) & James Hegedus is excellent. The set decoration by Robert Gould is excellent. The costume design by Denise Wingate is excellent. Just like "Rocky Balboa" last year (2006), this one is the best in its series since the original. This is an action-packed, stunt-filled feast and one of the better action films of recently.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>"Live Free or Die Hard" is a great film.  Even if you had been on Planet Zircon & hadn't seen the first three films, this would still put a smile on your face.  Bruce Willis surpasses recent action efforts such as "16 Blocks" & <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FKO5QK">Lucky Number Slevin (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  Len Wiseman's third film after two "Underworld" vampire pictures puts the audience on a roller coaster that leaves us breathless at the final frame.  Justin Long who may not be all that famous anymore for kissing Britney Spears in "Crossroads" does a great job as computer hacker Matt Farrell.  The opening sequence, where Willis goes to his apartment only to survive barrage after barrage, sets a pace that does not slow.  Timothy Olyphant who to me looks like he should film the Ryan Seacrest bio pic, may make you forget that he played a gay photographer in "The Broken Hearts Club."  He also did good work in "Gone in Sixty Seconds" & "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMX6">The Girl Next Door (Unrated Version)</a>."  As Thomas Gabriel, he smirks, he stews until we're glad he won't be around for DH5.  Maggie Q as his evil girlfriend trumps her job in "Mission Impossible 3" and plays Mai Linh somewhere between an iceberg and a blizzard.  "She likes to kick people," Willis comments.  Mary Elizabeth Winstead from "Grind House" & "The Ring Two" plays Lucy McClane.  She puts a smile on our face as she seems to be a chip off the old block.  "What'd he say about me?" is the perfect ending for the character as she obsesses on her hormonal level.  Kevin Smith who wrote and directed "Clerks" & "Dogma" and is in the upcoming "Catch & Release" does a great job in the cameo role as the computer hacker Warlock.  Bruce Willis infuses McClane with humor that lets us laugh between thrills.  This is a perfect summer film to turn off our brains and cheer getting the bad guy.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>Just because a film is filled to the brim with awesome action sequences does not excuse it from having an actual plot. Live Free or Die Hard, the 4th kinda sorta but not really sequel is all action and no plausable story line. Though far better than the 2nd sequel, it doesn't even begin to compare to the first movie, or even the surprisingly cool Die Hard With a Vengeance. Those had an actual plot that you can follow even though they were a tad on the far-fetched side.<br /><br />For this movie, you pretty much have to suspend all belief and sort of go with the flow, if you like that kind of thing. There is nothing wrong with mindless violence in films; we see it all the time. But it's hard to enjoy a film if you are scratching your head over the ridiculous story line.<br /><br />The one good thing about this film is Justin Long. He's a funny nerdy type of character and it completely works. Bruce Willis is laid back and fits into his role nicely, but it really is the same old thing over again. Also, the whole subplot with his daughter is pointless AND when exactly did he have a kid? No mention of it was ever made in the third one and she seems to be at least seventeen. It's been only thirteen years since the last one came out, and he wasn't that young back then. It just seemed sort of weird watching it.<br /><br />Though the plot is ridiculous and confusing, it is also very predictable. There is nothing new or exciting; it really is the same old thing you've probably seen a million times over. I would definetely skip this one and check out D H 1& 3 instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A37OOQQLMMKYR8.html">A37OOQQLMMKYR8</a><br/><p>Upon the release of Live Free or Die Hard I refused to see it. I have no problem with movies being PG-13. A great movie is a great movie regardless of the rating. But the previous 3 Die Hard movies were R-rated and when FOX decided to have the latest Die Hard movie PG-13 I refused to see it. My $10 didn't mean anything; with or without my money the movie would be a hit or flop, but for me it was just the point. The DVD release, which is Unrated is the R-rated cut.<br /><br />It's been 12-years since Die Hard: With a Vengeance and I was a little worried how Live Free or Die Hard would come out, whenever a franchise is resurrected after a long period of time it doesn't always seem to work. Of course there are always gonna be exceptions, but I can't help, but get that feeling of unease. With Live Free or Die Hard I personally found it to be a mixed bag. The biggest problem for me is it feels like every other action movie out there since the Michael Bay era started.<br /><br />Ever action scene has to be bigger and better and storytelling seems to take a backseat to the action sequences and CGI. The first 3 Die Hard movies were very well done. That was back when Hollywood was still able to produce great action movies. At the end of the day the Die Hard movies are mindless fun, but they actually have a plot to go with the action scenes.<br /><br />The screenplay by Mark Bomback was alright, but it lacked the creativity and originality of the previous 3. The script feels like the typical Hollywood blockbuster and the Die Hard movies were more than that. The first half of the movie actually doesn't really feel like Die Hard. It seems like the script was written as another action movie and the executives at FOX decided to make it Die Hard 4. Just change the name of the lead character to John McClane and there you go. The 2nd half though the screenplay improves a bit and starts to feel like a Die Hard movie. But the wisecracks McClane says in my opinion seemed a bit forced, Bruce Willis sells them, but they just seemed a bit forced from a writing stand-point.<br /><br />Director Len Wiseman seems to be hit or miss with the audience, a lot of people say how bad of a filmmaker he is. I have to disagree; filmmaking is more than just storytelling. Obviously, that is the most important part of being a director, but a lot more goes into it. Len Wiseman is the perfect Hollywood filmmaker. He knows how to craft a movie for the mass audience. Live Free or Die Hard might lack in storytelling, but the movie is well made. What he lacks in storytelling skills he makes up for in being able to craft a well made movie.<br /><br />The action scenes are a mixed bag. They don't come out nearly as well as the previous 3 and at times a little too over the top. Now I know you're probably thinking I must be an idiot for saying that since the previous 3 weren't exactly realistic. That is true if you want realism the Die Hard series aren't the movies to watch. But the job of the filmmakers is to make us believe the unbelievable. And to be honest I just couldn't buy into some of the action scenes. They were over the top like the previous 3, but I just couldn't buy into it like I did with the other Die Hard movies.<br /><br />That's not to say the action scenes were bad, by no means were they at all, but I just felt they didn't work as well and maybe a little clich&eacute;d. The action is mostly good and they are fun to watch, but I just feel as if they didn't work nearly as well as they could have.<br /><br />The acting was quite solid and honestly that is what elevates Live Free or Die Hard. Timothy Olyphant makes for a good villain. His performance was solid even if his character was lacking a little bit. And Maggie Q also does a solid job. Her fight scene with McClane was classic. The villains were good, but not as interesting as the previous 3.<br /><br />Mary Elizabeth Winstead was excellent in a small, but vital role. Her character of McClane's daughter Lucy appears early than is MIA until the final act. Originally Britney Spears was a possible choice and Jessica Simpson had an audition. Thankfully neither of them got it. I would have liked to have seen Winstead in a bigger role, but regardless I greatly enjoyed her performance. Cult filmmaker Kevin Smith has a small role and nearly steals the show.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is still giving it his all as John McClane. His performance was excellent and Justin Long steals the show as Matthew Farrell. The reason this movie worked so well was due to Willis and Long. The two really worked well together and give a lot of life to their characters. Willis and Long are a bit clich&eacute;d, even though Justin Long isn't a cop in the movie it does sort have that buddy cop vibe going for it. But the two really do great together.<br /><br />The main reason I'm giving Live Free or Die Hard 4-stars is simple; there are flaws and I personally think it's the weakest of the series. But the movie is entertaining. There is enough action and wisecracks to keep the viewer entertained. Live Free is never boring something is always happening to keep the viewer interested. Even though I feel Len Wiseman may not be the best storyteller out there his scenes do run at a good pace. The pacing never lags and the plot always moves forward. Another reason for the 4-stars is also due to Willis and Long who really do elevate the movie.<br /><br />In closing, while Live Free or Die Hard might lack in overall storytelling compared to the previous 3 and while the action scenes are good they do lack compared to the others, Live Free or Die Hard is still a well made and entertaining movie that moves at a good pace. While as a fan of the series I have to say it was a major letdown, but there is enough going on to keep the viewer entertained.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>Live Free, Die Hard had me grinning from ear to ear.  Because of the overblown trailers, I feared the movie would contain only explosions and car crashes, with no plot.  Thankfully, this movie is well done, with a good story, good enough acting, fantastic lighting, and good sets.  And how refreshing to see a movie not reliant on computer-generated special effects.  This film is a testosterone feast a la 300.  Highly recommended for old school action movie buffs.  This is a classic.<br /><br />Through the whole movie, one thing drove me crazy.  For the life of me, I could not recall where I had seen the actor who played the young hacker.  He looked so familiar.  My husband came down to watch the last part with me.  He pointed the actor out as the Mac in the Mac & PC ads!</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>After having a vicious assault be temporarily staved off , Justin Long's character shakily asks his savior if he's done stuff like that before - and if he's killed someone before - to which John McClane's laconic response is "Not for a long time." And, indeed, it's been 12 long years since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O78KW4">Die Hard with a Vengeance (Widescreen Edition)</a>. John McClane is now older, balder, grumpier, and, being saddled with a PG-13 rating, not as profane, but he still cannot stay out of trouble. This time he's assigned the seemingly mundane task of escorting in young hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long), who's wanted for questioning. But the situation quickly sours as, within moments of meeting Farrell, McClane begins to hear that oh-so-familiar melody of automatic gunfire directed at their noggins.<br /><br />Both McClane and the frail but side-of-the-mouth funny computer geek speedily realize that Farrell's fringe involvement is merely the very tip of the iceberg, and that the stakes are much, much higher. Turns out that the contractor who'd hired Farrell to do a simple, innocuous code work is scheming to hold the entire nation hostage with his own paralyzing brand of cyber terrorism. Soon, the systematical shutdown of the American infrastructure is underway as, basically, all things computerized become compromised. This includes the targeting and usurping of key establishments such as the FAA, Amtrak, the stock market, and our satellite communications system. But, for Los Angelinos like myself, the most insidious act committed may have been the subversing of *gasp* the street traffic lights.<br /><br />For the now grizzled John McClane, nothing much has changed. He's a Lieutenant Detective now, so he's kind of moved up in the world. And he still has those perpetually pursed lips. But his personal life is predictably very much in shambles. He's alone again, divorced (with his ex-wife Holly gone back to using her Gennero surname) and estranged from his children. The start of the film has McClane pathetically attempting to keep tabs on his sullen and willful daughter, Lucy Gennero (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). But she wants none of his reconciliatory gestures. Not to mention, McClane's an anachronistic type who clings to classic rock music and who is computer unsavvy. Good thing he's got a hacker in his custody.<br /><br />It's such a treat to watch Bruce Willis again be in his element and playing this iconic role. Not that Entertainment Weekly has the final say, but I do agree with the magazine's listed assessment of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O77SRC">Die Hard (Widescreen Edition)</a> as being the top action film ever (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012FXAE">Aliens (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a> was number 2, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was number 3). Nowadays, Willis, at 52 years old, is not as spry or free with the smirks. But his physicality, even at this stage, can't be questioned as he suffered bruises and scars in the making of this film. As McClane, he still trounces bad guys with the best of 'em. But, more so than McClane's penchant for arse whoopin', what draws the audience to him is that aura of reluctance, world weariness, and doggedness which he exudes so naturally. We relate to this ordinary, blue collar cat who, time and again, becomes stuck in the wrong place at the wrong time and is forced to angrily muddle thru because there's no one else to do the job. Although LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD portrays McClane as more of a supercop this time, who can go one on one with an F-35 fighter jet and murder an assault chopper with a car, I still fondly remember the first film, in which McClane passed muster as a very likable everyday guy barely keeping it together in Nakatomi Plaza. John McClane has built up so much good will that I'm able to easily forgive - and even celebrate - the high octane and wildly improbable excesses here.<br /><br />Justin Long, dubiously best known as the Mac guy in the Apple computer ad campaigns, gets his number called for sidekick duties, and he does a good job, although there were times where his trembly act got to be too much. His Matt Farrell may be a borderline computer felon but his heart's in the right place. Long gets to make the brunt of the wisecracks while McClane tersely motors along (he says to some fellow geeks who'd just blown his cover, "Good luck at the Bad Timing Awards."). One failing of the film is the lack of a charismatic villain. Timothy Olyphant is unmemorable as former Homeland Security computer whiz Thomas Gabriel, whose mission is to digitally teach the nation and his ex-bosses a lesson while garnering sinful financial amounts. There's nothing fresh or arresting about Olyphant's acting performance, which basically consists of a whole lot of staring really hard. But, admittedly, it's fun to witness Gabriel's ever growing exasperation as McClane persists in surviving. Maggie Q does better as the evil hot Asian babe who's also a formidable martial artist. Her character Mai proves to be pretty resilient (but, ultimately, not resilient enough). Writer and maverick director Kevin Smith gets a chance to mug for the camera as the Warlock (or Freddy, to his mom), a jedi hacker whose base of operations is in his mother's basement. Bonnie Bedelia, by the way, is sorely missed, and the film would've benefited with more scenes between McClain and his surly daughter.<br /><br />LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD was primed to be a colossal summer blockbuster, and, as such, it had certain criteria it had to meet. Director Len Wiseman (the UNDERWORLD films) comes strong and full bore with great visuals, a relentless pace, implausible action sequences, and crazy pyrotechnics. And all this performed at raucous, senses shattering decibels. The stunts are mindblowing, keeping in mind that CG effects were kept to a minimum. These are flesh and bone stunts being done here. But, still, at the heart of the loud thrill-a-minutes, there is Bruce Willis keeping it all together with his signature McClane-isms. I still get a vast kick out of his un-PC chortling whenever he causes yet another bad guy's demise (oh, that poor, agile-as-a-monkey French dude). As always, to me, his mockery of death, in a way, adds a layer of realism as this has become McClane's way of ackowledging his vulnerability and celebrating his surviving yet another harrowing scrape. LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is PG-13, but the film finds ways to circumvent the rating as the ever resourceful McClane continues to cuss (but minus the "F" word) and ad-lib his way to amassing an impressive body count. Yippee-ki-yay, emmer-effer.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>The FBI is working on tracking down cyber terrorists all the time.

The FBI asks John Mc Clane (Bruce Willis) to pick up Matt Farrell (Justin Long) and as John arrives he is just in time to save Matt's life from hired assassins.

The government is trying to get ahead of the problem but John Mc Clane is one of the key answers to help solve the problem with Matt Farrell, a genius computer hacker.<br /><br />I love this series of movies with Bruce Willis and this is one of the best ones made.

I really enjoyed this movie and I recommend it to you!</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>Die Hard is considered by many film buffs as the greatest action movie ever made. There is just something about the character of John McClane that attracts movie goers. Is it his spunky attitude or is it the fact that he is known for having really bad days? It's both. There have been action franchises that have run out of steam in the past, but all three Die Hard films were great fun. Usually I'm not a fan of dipping into the well one too many times, but if Batman Begins and Casino Royale were able to re-spark the magic then why not give Die Hard another go?<br /><br />Live Free Or Die Hard takes an old fashioned cop and throws him out of his element, which leaves room for a supporting character. Justin Long steps in as McClane's frazzled and tech wizard sidekick. Timothy Olyphant plays a cyber terrorist who decides to shutdown the entire nation in order to systematically collect hundreds of millions of bank account numbers in order to show the government that the system can in fact be broken. Now it's up to John McClane and his sidekick Matthew Farrell to save the day.<br /><br />What follows is high octane action that one expects from a Die Hard movie. An important thing to point out is how director Len Wiseman stayed true to the Die Hard style and kept CGI to a minimum. Die Hard movies were great because they did action using real stunts and real explosions. The one thing I was afraid of was that this new Die Hard would go with the trend and use CGI as a crutch when in fact it used it as a tool. There are plenty of stunts that are real sets and real explosions. A few scenes fallback on CGI, but only because doing them for real just wouldn't work. Bruce Willis also keeps the spunk that is John McClane. You'll laugh at the one-liners and the witty remarks that Willis adds in the tensest situations and of course Justin Long is just great with sarcasm. They make a great on-screen duo. I also think that the humor in the Die Hard series is what makes it such a great action series. It's the fact that the filmmakers realize they are making an action movie; a movie in which nothing could ever happen in real life. Lots of action movies take themselves too seriously and they become laughably bad, but Live Free Or Die Hard keeps that spunk that makes it laughably enjoyable. Don't get me wrong though; there are some amazing action scenes that will make you tense up. This is by no means a comedy. The elevator shaft scene was one that stood out and reminded me of the trailer hanging off the cliff in Spielberg's The Lost World.<br /><br />Moving onto the score this brings up Marco Beltrami. I can state here that I am not a Marco Beltrami fan. The only score of his that I liked was his score to The Three Burials Of Melquiades Estrada. I always feel like he never does anything thematic at all and which is why I was worried when he was selected to fill Michael Kamen's shoes. Michael Kamen was the composer of the first three Die Hard films, but sadly he passed away in 2003. He was a greatly respected composer and his work on the first three Die Hards were iconic. Thankfully Marco Beltrami rose to the occasion and did a wonderful tribute with his score to Live Free Or Die Hard. He touches on some themes that Kamen wrote and gives it that Die Hard feel and atmosphere.<br /><br />Overall this movie was great. I had a great time watching it and felt like it was better than most of the high budget stuff I've seen this summer so far. Sometimes we need to go back to the basics to remind us why we love what we love. The reason why we love action movies is because of Die Hard and it was great fun seeing McClane back in action.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U360OMVQRPUB.html">A1U360OMVQRPUB</a><br/><p>The DIE HARD franchise isn't a thinking man's dream.  It belongs to the wannabe action hero inside every red-blooded American male.  And to the women who love them.  Any misapprehension that these films are going to take themselves realistically or seriously should be checked at the door.<br /><br />LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD opened Wednesday of this week just in time for the Fourth of July celebration, and to take advantage of the extra-long weekend at the box office. It's the fourth film in the franchise about New York Police Department Detective John McClane, absolutely the toughest cop Hollywood has ever created. In my opinion. Nobody bleeds like McClane bleeds. Or limps. Or talks to himself, delivering a humorous, self-deprecating monologue on how he got into the whole mess he is in.<br /><br />There was some hesitation about whether or not Bruce Willis could pull off the franchise character again. There was no hesitation about the fact that if Bruce Willis could not play McClane, no one else could. Willis the actor and McClane the character are too tightly-knit to allow to anyone else to intrude into the franchise. Maybe other actors can play James Bond and win over a whole new audience, but I can't see that happening with this one. Not as long as Bruce Willis can still walk and talk.<br /><br />After seeing the movie, there's no doubt that Willis - and McClane -are back in a big way. For a while, Willis swore he'd never play the character again. He wanted more serious roles and a chance to stretch as an actor. He's made some good films, and some not so good films, since DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE with Samuel L. Jackson. And while the McClane role is somewhat limiting Willis pulls it off with zest. Maybe he was born to do other things as well, but he was definitely born to be John McClane.<br /><br />Now all the fans are going to be waiting for the next Die Hard movie, although there hasn't been any talk of such. We can only hope.<br /><br />The movie starts out with a bang, the way these things always do. A group of cyber-criminals utilize code and algorithms written by blackboard computer hackers to get into key Federal government installations, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation. They're operating under a man named Thomas Gabriel, who has used enough players in his operation that none of the computer hackers know who they are working for or what they are truly doing.<br /><br />As soon as Gabriel is certain that he's into the computer networks he wants to be into, he gives orders to start the elimination process of all the computer hackers involved. The action turns violent and bloody. Matt Farrell (played brilliantly by Justin Long) is the only one who escapes his fate, and that's only through the direct intervention of McClane.<br /><br />It's been twelve years since the last DIE HARD movie. Those twelve years are reflected in the latest release. McClane has gotten older and his life has moved on. His wife finally left him for good and he's estranged from his son and daughter. He's introduced breaking up his daughter's latest date in a fairly humorous scene.<br /><br />One of the things that was awkwardly handled in the movie was Lucy's - McClane's daughter -sudden change in feelings about her father. Viewers knew it was coming, but it came without true motivation from within. That part felt particularly scripted.<br /><br />When McClane gets the call to go pick up a known computer hacker, the tension immediately ratchets up. In a move that was also very scripted, McClane arrives at Matt's house just in time to keep him from being blown to smithereens. (And you have to wonder why the bad guys simply didn't walk into each of the hackers' houses/apartments and simply shoot them when they were done with them.  The explosions were just to give the special effects crew a warm-up for the action that was coming.)<br /><br />The cat and mouse game begins, with McClane alternately fighting to stay alive and chasing the bad guys. The action sequences are pure dynamite, fueled by adrenaline and testosterone - on part of the characters and the audience. Viewers that are totally into the McClane experience are hard pressed not to hoot and holler in support of their hero's actions and one-liners.<br /><br />Those fans understand that there are glaring plot holes and things that make no sense and in the real world things wouldn't function the way they do in the movie. For instance, the cell phone systems would go down almost immediately as emergency services took them over to use for their own operations. McClane uses a cell phone a lot in the beginning of the movie, as do the terrorists. Those would be the first things shut down. Security on major important network sites, like the eastern seaboard utility control area, would be immediately entrenched in military personnel if the United States government believed it was under attack.<br /><br />But that's beside the point. This film is about action, not about reality. Reality would be much slower paced.<br /><br />As always, McClane ends up being the guy involved in the investigation who gets all the key pieces as to what's really going on. It wouldn't be a DIE HARD movie if he didn't.<br /><br />The concept of the "fire sale" in the realms of cyber-terrorism is a real thing. There are a lot of checks and balances to keep it at bay, but it is one of the things the United States government constantly guards against. The movie sells the idea very well.<br /><br />Also, though the franchise isn't known for being cutting-edge or high-tech, there's a lot of the emerging computer technology and integrated systems that are nationwide and international in the film. Justin Long's character introduces all that technology and the concepts behind it in bite-sized chunks that the audience can keep track of in the midst of car chases, gunfights, and serious explosions.<br /><br />I found myself as enthralled by the computer attacks as I was by McClane's usual physical action and banter. There was something so inherently cool about watching the terror-geeks and Matt Ferrell at work on computer systems even though much of it was fake. The idea that it was all possible and would be done in such a way was amazing.<br /><br />But the action - that's the key to every Die Hard film. There's plenty of it in this movie. Is it over the top? No doubt about it! No one - but no one - could walk away from all the damage that McClane takes while doggedly pursuing the bad guys. I lost count of the number of bodies left behind, the number of vehicles that were destroyed in wrecks and explosions, the number of buildings that were leveled, and would have to guess that the number of bullets fired must be in the millions.<br /><br />The most over-the-top sequence in the film is the scene where McClane is driving an eighteen-wheeler through a system of elevated highways while being pursued and fired upon by a military attack jet with hover capability. There is simply no way this could ever happen, or that a truck could suffer that much damage and still keep going. Much less without the driver getting killed.<br /><br />If they do a video game on this movie as they have some of the movies in the past, you can see this sequence being part of the game. It's ludicrous.  It's impossible.  And yet, it's so McClane. And that's what puts the butts in the seats, folks.<br /><br />Maggie Q plays possibly the most lethal lady McClane has ever had the misfortune of crossing paths with. She absolutely tears him apart for a while. And that leads to possibly the second-most over-the-top sequence in the film when the action spreads the elevator shaft. Still, if anybody was gonna do it like this, it has to be rogue cop John McClane.<br /><br />Make no mistake. This film isn't for posterity. This film isn't even close to Academy Award material - except maybe for special effects.<br /><br />What this film is, and where it succeeds so admirably, is an action film starring one of the best action heroes ever invented or portrayed, and played once more by the only actor that could do that character justice. This is superhero action without the cape and the mutant abilities. And this is a hero who's fallible yet impossible to beat.<br /><br />Treat yourself to a summer delight over the holidays. Buy a ticket. Invest heavily in a willing suspension of disbelief at the door. Find a good seat. And prepare to cheer on John McClane one more time as he goes up against impossible - and, admittedly, wildly improbable - odds.</p></br><a href="../users/A109LWN9DUGPDP.html">A109LWN9DUGPDP</a><br/><p>The three stars is for the PG-13 version thats on this blu ray.Live free or Die Hard I think is the best one yet.As for the PG-13 version first its more than just a couple curse words Its more like 25 curse words.Second if your a fan of Die Hard you know that profanity is part of what John McClane is,I think the movie loses a little bit of that raw edge without it,come on this is DIE HARD.I first bought the blu ray version at midnight at wal-mart,I thought oh well so its not the unrated version.I thought the unrated version was probly just a curse word or two maybe some extra violence.After watching the blu ray two things hit me the first was that the blu ray does look really good and sounds great but I also thought it may have lost a little bit of that rawness from the previous films becouse of the PG-13.So today I bought the unrated DVD version<br />and yes it makes a big diffrence on the movie it has the crazy,raw John McClane like we are use to.Just get the unated version now they'll release an unrated blu ray soon enough.I guess the studio thought they would lose some money if teenagers with Playstation 3 couldn't buy this so they left the blu ray PG-13.Thats to bad</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>In 1988 a little movie came out which would change the course of how movies were made. Actually, it wasn't any kind of movie, but action movies to be exact. It also introduced a new character to the movie landscape. The character was NYPD detective John McClane and the movie he was part of was Die Hard. This movie redefined the action movie and the action movie hero for a whole generation of film fans with it's tense and nonstop action in conjunction with an everyman hero-type who wasn't indestructible and who showed every cut, gash, bruise and damage he went through to try and save the day. The movie became a sensation and launched the career of one Mr. Bruce Willis. It was followed up by two more sequels (one great and the other one not-so great) over the years with the last one coming out in 1995. It is now 2007 and a dozen years has passed. 20th Century Fox has gone back to the well and came out with a third sequel titled Live Free or Die Hard (to be called Die Hard 4.0 overseas). This third sequel has a new director in Len Wiseman (of Underworld and Underworld: Evolution fame) with Bruce Willis reprising his role as the wisecracking NYPD detective John McClane. This third sequel has turned out better than I expected and I can honestly say it's way better than Die Hard with a Vengeance and on equal footing with the first two in the series.<br /><br />The movie begins with the premise of cyber-terrorists with the help of a group of unsuspecting hackers beginning the early stages of an attack on the U.S. National infrastructure. Using a script based on the Wired magazine article, A Farewell to Arms, Len Wiseman and crew do a great job of quickly establishing the main danger that's to face John McClane and the young hacker Matthew Farrell (played by Justin Long in the comedic sidekick role) throughout the length of the movie. The bad guys this time around revolve around one Thomas Gabriel (played by Deadwood's Timothy Olyphant) and his gang of hired mercenaries and cyber-terrorists. He plans to shutdown the entire United States through its infracstructure, financial centers, utilities and pretty much everything that's tied into the millions upon millions of computer systems which now run the entirety of the nation. Gabriel's motives looks to be one born out of revenge and the need to show that he was right, but this being a Die Hard movie there's always a hidden agenda that would be brought to light to signal the final reel of the film. Accompanying Gabriel is one Mai Lihn (played by the very sexy Maggie Q) who ends up giving John McClane more than he can handle in one of the many action sequences throughout the movie.<br /><br />The way Gabriel and his men attacks the national computer systems running everything in the United States looked very convincing. Whether it was gaining access and disrupting the traffic controls for both roads and airspace to systematically amping up the level of attacks both real and fake was enough to convince this viewer that this so-called virtual "firesale" on a nation's computer infrastructure is definitely plausible. And throughout all the many catastrophes caused by Gabriel and his men John McClane with hacker Farrell in tow must navigate through not just the hired mercenaries hired to be the muscle of the operation, but through the chaos created by Gabriel's cyber-attacks.<br /><br />John McClane has aged quite a bit since we last saw him trying to stop another group of "terrorists" from blowing up half of New York a little over a dozen years past. He has more than a little bit less hair and looks quite worn out and old. But for some reason he's once again in the wrong place at the wrong time and with no one else there to help him stop what's going on other than a geeky and unathletic hacker at his side, McClane really had to raise the heroism to levels not really seen in the previous three installments in the franchise. He gets more than his fair share of being shot at, blown up and beat to an inch of his life by acrobatic French assassins and martial-arts expert femme fatales. McClane gets bounced around and it shows, but he's like the Energizer Bunny who keeps on ticking no matter whats thrown at him. This time around what he's lost through the march of time and the creeping of old age he has gained through hard-fought knowledge. He's been around this block more than a few times and he seems to have learned enough to keep him and his charge alive.<br /><br />The work by Len Wiseman really shows that he knows how to shoot action scenes. He's no John McTiernan, but Wiseman seem to have seen enough of the movies in the franchise to know that Michael Bay-style direction is not what needed, but a throwback to how action movies were made using real stuntmen and vehicles was what would make this movie fun and exciting. For successfully pulling this project off I will admit that Wiseman may have been the best choice to make this movie. There wasn't much complexity in the script for Wiseman to work with but he got enough out of it to fill up two full hours of movie running time without boring the audience. That's quite an accomplishment compared to some of the more bloated films this summer, though quite enjoyable and fun on their own right, were still quite too long.<br /><br />In the end, Live Free or Die Hard is a step back in time to the golden age of action movies where what we saw on the screen was nonstop action done in pre-CGI ways with real non-CGI people. Bruce Willis brings back his John McClane and he comes back with a vengeance to wreak havoc once more on the bad guys attempts to get rich. For a summer blockbuster season of 2007 which has seen one blockbuster fail audience expectations in one way or another, Live Free or Die Hard lives up to all its expectations and actually turned out to be one of the movies of this summer. All it took was for an old action hero to make a comeback.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>After having temporarily staved off a vicious assault, Justin Long's character shakily asks his savior if he's done stuff like that before and if he's killed someone before, to which John McClane's laconic response is "Not for a long time." And, indeed, it's been 12 long years since DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE. John McClane is now older, balder, grumpier, and, saddled with a PG-13 rating, not as profane, but he still cannot stay out of trouble. This time, he's assigned the seemingly mundane task of escorting in young hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long), who's wanted for questioning. But the situation quickly sours as, within moments of meeting Farrell, McClane begins to hear that oh-so-familiar melody of automatic gunfire directed at their noggins.<br /><br />Both McClane and the frail but side-of-the-mouth funny computer geek speedily realize that Farrell's fringe involvement is merely the very tip of the iceberg, and that the stakes are much, much higher. Turns out that the contractor who'd hired Farrell to do a simple, innocuous code work is scheming to hold the entire nation hostage with his own paralyzing brand of cyber terrorism. Soon, the systematical shutdown of the American infrastructure is underway as, basically, all things computerized become compromised. This includes the targeting and usurping of key establishments such as the FAA, Amtrak, the stock market, and our satellite communications system. But, for Los Angelinos like myself, the most insiduous act commited may have been the subversing of *gasp* the street traffic lights.<br /><br />For the now grizzled John McClane, nothing much has changed. He's a Lieutenant Detective now, so he's kind of moved up in the world. And he still has those perpetually pursed lips. But his personal life is predictably very much of a mess. He's alone again, divorced (with his ex-wife Holly gone back to using her Gennero surname) and estranged from his children. The start of the film has McClane pathetically attempting to keep tabs on his wilful and sullen daughter, Lucy Gennero (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). But she wants none of his reconciliatory gestures. Not to mention, McClane's an anachronistic type who clings to classic rock music and who is computer unsavvy. Good thing he's got a hacker in his custody.<br /><br />It's such a treat to watch Bruce Willis again be in his element and playing this iconic role. Not that Entertainment Weekly has the final say, but I do agree with the magazine's listed assessment of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002B15WE">Die Hard (Widescreen Edition)</a> as being the top action film ever (ALIENS was number 2, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was number 3). Nowadays, Willis, at 52 years old, is not as spry or free with the smirks. But his physicality, even at this stage, can't be questioned as he suffered bruises and scars in the making of this film. As McClane, he still trounces bad guys with the best of 'em. But, more so than McClane's penchant for arse whoopin', what draws the audience to him is that aura of reluctance, world weariness, and doggedness which he exudes so naturally. We relate to this ordinary, blue collar cat who, time and again, becomes stuck in the wrong place at the wrong time and is forced to angrily muddle thru because there's no one else to do the job. Although LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD portrays McClane as more of a supercop this time, who can go one on one with an F-35 fighter jet and murder an assault chopper with a car, I still fondly remember the first film, in which McClane passed muster as a very likable everyday guy barely keeping it together in Nakatomi Plaza. John McClane has built up so much good will that I'm able to easily forgive - and even celebrate - the high octane and wildly improbable excesses here.<br /><br />Justin Long, dubiously best known as the Mac guy in the Apple computer ad campaigns, gets his number called for sidekick duties, and he does a good job, although there were times where his trembly act got to be too much. His Matt Farrell may be a borderline computer felon but his heart's in the right place. Long gets to make the brunt of the wisecracks while McClane tersely motors along (he says to some fellow geeks who'd just blown his cover, "Good luck at the Bad Timing Awards."). One failing of the film is the lack of a charismatic villain. Timothy Olyphant is unmemorable as former Homeland Security computer whiz Thomas Gabriel, whose mission is to digitally teach the nation and his ex-bosses a lesson while garnering sinful financial amounts. There's nothing fresh or arresting about Olyphant's acting performance, which basically consists of a whole lot of staring really hard. But, admittedly, it's fun to witness Gabriel's ever growing exasperation as McClane persists in surviving. Maggie Q does better as the evil hot Asian babe who's also a formidable martial artist. Her character Mai proves to be pretty resilient (but, ultimately, not resilient enough). Writer and maverick director Kevin Smith gets a chance to mug for the camera as the Warlock (or Freddy, to his mom), a jedi hacker whose base of operations is in his mother's basement. Bonnie Bedelia, by the way, is sorely missed, and the film would've benefited with more scenes between McClain and his surly daughter.<br /><br />LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is primed to be a colossal summer blockbuster, and, as such, it has certain criteria it has to meet. Director Len Wiseman (the UNDERWORLD films) comes strong and full bore with great visuals, a relentless pace, implausible action sequences, and crazy pyrotechnics. And all this performed at raucous, senses shattering decibels. The stunts are mindblowing, keeping in mind that CG effects were kept to a minimum. These are flesh and bone stunts being done here. But, still, at the heart of the loud thrill-a-minutes, there is Bruce Willis keeping it all together with his signature McClane-isms. I still get a vast kick out of his un-PC chortling whenever he causes yet another bad guy's demise (oh, that poor, agile-as-a-monkey French dude). As always, to me, his mockery of death, in a way, adds a layer of realism as this has become McClane's way of ackowledging his vulnerability and celebrating his surviving yet another harrowing scrape. LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is PG-13, but the film finds ways to circumvent the rating as the ever resourceful McClane continues to cuss (but minus the "F" word) and ad-lib his way to amassing an impressive body count. Yippee-ki-yay, futhermucker.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>This movie was ridiculous. Willis' character is more like Superman, Batman, Wolverine and The Hulk all rolled into one. He is inhuman and more like his character in Unbreakable than the origional character in Die Hard.<br /><br />The movie is so full of unbelievable action and stunts that it just seems like the director and writer were trying to take you on a roller coaster ride just for the the hell of it. The story is stupid and the dialogue is horrible.<br /><br />The could have called this Die Hard 4 Cannot Die So What Is The Point.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>After a 12-year absence, Bruce Willis returns as New York detective John McClane in this disappointing "Die Hard" sequel. Willis delivers the "yippee ki yay" goods, but the film lacks a strong cast, coherent scripting and the firm hand of director John McTiernan. The cyber-terrorist plot is a letdown after McClane's cat-and-mouse games with the Gruber brothers - further hindered by cartoonish action sequences and a ludicrous climax. Though slightly better than "Die Hard 2," this fourth installment doesn't measure up to the Willis-McTiernan collaborations.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>The FBI is working on tracking down cyber terrorists all the time.

The FBI asks John Mc Clane (Bruce Willis) to pick up Matt Farrell (Justin Long) and as John arrives he is just in time to save Matt's life from hired assassins.

While all those series got re-booted in the 2000s, they also contained a heavy dose of nostalgia for the past.  In "Live Free or Die Hard", however, it is "full steam ahead" with little time for remembrance.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Live Free" sees John McClane (Willis) pulled into another tense criminal situation when villain Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Oliphant) executes an event of cyber-terrorism severe enough to bring Washington to its knees.  Along with "hack-boy" Matt Farrell (Justin Long), McClane sets out to find the perpetrators and bring them some 1980s-style justice.<br /><br />This film really works primarily due to airtight direction & pacing.  Director Len Wiseman never lets the pace flag whatsoever.  When the action dies down, the wisecracks & humor ramps up.  Suffice it to say that there is never a boring moment what with all the action, chases, explosions, technology, & typical Willis humor.<br /><br />The main plot ("cyber-terrorism") also serves to usher McClane into the 21st century.  McClane's old-school justice provides a nice counterpoint to the tech-nerd played by Long (who is actually, on a rare occasion, watchable in this effort).<br /><br />Actually, the only negative thing I can say about this movie is that I almost wished it would have harkened back to the themes of the original even perhaps a bit more.  There is a subplot involving the daughter of McClane, but little more is mentioned (besides a few "easter egg moments") regarding the original Die Hard trilogy.<br /><br />Overall, though, "Live Free" is a great addition to the Die Hard cannon (already better than parts two & three).  For an action-oriented film, it really holds its weight.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>Now I'm reviewing Live Free Or Die Hard the last installment of the Die Hard series until they do Die Hard 5. Live Free or Die Hard is just a fun ride with Bruce Wills reprising his McClane role also starring Timothy Olyphant as Thomas Gaberial Justin Long as Matt Ferrell & Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Lucy Genaro McClane. Your plot is the most straight forward of any of the Die Hard movies basically this guy Thomas Gaberial once worked for the Government & was fired for some s**t he shouldn't of done & him & his team are going to shut the entire country down by cyber terrorism. John McClane has to protect this kid Matt Ferrell from these terrorist's also his daughter is kidnapped. I know this wasn't the best explaination of the plot but it's straight forward. My only complaints were PG 13 & Timothy Olyphant was 1 dimensional & looked like he was talking through his teeth a lot. I mean didn't Olyphant watch Alan Rickman or Jermy Irons or even William Sadler. He wasn't terrible but Colonel Stuart had more personality. The action was very good the effects were top notch I'm sure that CGI was used but as long as it's good CGI I have no problem with it. So I like this but not as much as 1-3 becuse of PG 13 rating. I haven't seen the unrated version I would like to. Some weird things was 1 of the original titles was Die Hard Tears Of The Sun Justin Timberlake was in talks to play Jack McClane John's son. In fact the original plot had Jack McClane as the hacker. Brad Renfro auditioned for the Matt role. Ben Afleck was 1 choice to play Jack when McClane's son was involved in the original script. Jessica Simpson auditioned for the role of Lucy McClane. It took 4 months to edit the video package that was used as Thomas Gaberial's warning. This was originally not written as a Die Hard sequel. This was the only Die Hard sequel not mentioning the events of the Nakatomi towers. Ok something that makes me say what? Is oh it's unrealistic. DID YOU SEE ANY OF THE 1ST 3 MOVIES! Cause this is a Die Hard movie not a safe watered down Matt Damon action movie. I just wish we could've had a more charismatic villain. Justin Long was no Reginald Vel Johnson or Samuel L Jackson but I liked him & Lucy in this movie So they gave good performances. . Other than PG 13 I'm  cool with this movie it's a good sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>An eternity ago, Bruce Willis was the wisecracking David Addison on a TV show called Moonlighting.  Few could have imagined that Die Hard (1988), would propel Willis to megastardom, and launch a new genre of action/adventure imitators.  The sequels, Die Hard 2 (1990), and Die Hard With A Vengeance (1995) followed, but as Willis continued a colorful film career, the prospects for a fourth John McClane adventure seemed slim.  Fortunately, Live Free or Die Hard (2007) happened.  The 52 year old Willis, defies time, with an impressive, kickbutt performance, that leaves you wondering why it took so long, for something this good to happen.<br /><br />Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), a disgruntled computer security expert, is engaged in compromising key computer networks, and killing the hackers that have unknowingly been helping him.  McClane is still a NYC cop, but time has brought changes, including divorce, and a daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who is too angry to have a conversation with him.  McClane is sent to bring in Matt Farrell (Justin Long), one of geeks on Gabriel's payroll, preventing him from becoming a fatality.<br /><br />Gabriel continues his attack on various key systems, and looks to close a loose end, targeting Farrell with a helicopter strike.  The action sequence in a tunnel is impressive, although a police car taking down the chopper is too much.  Gabriel's girlfriend Mai Linh (Maggie Q), a computer tech and martial arts expert, is sent to manage the takeover of a power plant, and has a spectacular tussle with McClane in an elevator shaft.  Things get personal between McClane and Gabriel, as the terrorist grabs his daughter Lucy.  FBI deputy director Miguel Bowman (Cliff Curtis), provides law enforcement support, that is always a few steps behind.<br /><br />Directed by Ted Wiseman (Underworld), Live Free or Die Hard does a pretty good job of capturing the spirit of the Die Hard series, over the top adventures, with a larger than life hero, where realism is not that big a deal, as long as a certain level of credibility is maintained.  McClane is older, wiser, and as irreverent as ever, although with his advanced age and lack of technical savvy, the emphasis on youth is clear.  "That guy" Matt Farrell, makes a quirky, atypical sidekick.  Thomas Gabriel, doesn't have the gravitas of a Hans Gruber, but he makes a pretty formidable baddie, despite his youth.  And daughter Lucy is quite the spitfire.  The stunts, action sequences, and special effects, are up to par, with just the right touch of excess.  Fans of the franchise, should not be disappointed.<br /><br />The two disc version has a nice set of extras, including a commentary with Bruce Willis, Len Wiseman, and editor Nicholas de Toth, and a nice assortment of making of featurettes.  What happens next with the venerable John McClane, remains to be seen, but let's just hope that he has not yippee ki-yayed for the last time.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>When someone hacks into the computers at the FBI's Cyber Crime Division; the Director decides to round up all the hackers who could have done this. When he's told that because it's the 4th of July most of their agents are not around so they might have trouble getting people to get the hackers. So he instructs them to get local PD'S to take care of it. And one of the cops they ask is John McClane who is tasked with bringing a hacker named Farrell to the FBI. But as soon as he gets there someone starts shooting at them. McClane manages to get them out but they're still being pursued. And it's just when McClane arrives in Washington that the whole system breaks down and chaos ensues. Willis is in his element. Olyphant is perfectly ice cold. Some great action sequences, including a fight to the death in an elevator shaft. This movie takes a classic climactic situation and resolves it in the coolest, most unexpected and most low-tech way imaginable, and in a way that reinforces everything you've ever liked about the "Die Hard" movies and McClane as a character. It's just terrific.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VJ80PM1G00QV.html">A2VJ80PM1G00QV</a><br/><p>Nothing much to add to the trunk-full  of  reviews except that the stunts alone are worth the price of admission.

Why? Because the last 2 sequels were pale repeats of the original premise with slight modifications in the plot like the hi-jacking of a plane or the threat of bombs blowing up in NYC.  The franchise seemed burned out and of course Willis himself was getting long in the tooth for these shenanigans!!  But lo and behold we get a re-boot in a plausible story line of how a disavowed  or disgrunted government worker creates a "fire sale" by hacking in on the main computers in the nation.  How's that for originality which was lacking in the sequels?  Also for once Willis is not such a super-hero like he was in the sequels and gets help from computer hacker Justin Long (that "Apple guy" in the commercials)--they are a perfect pair.  Though the villain, Timothy Olliyphant isn't engaging as Alan Rickman was in the original, there's plenty of knock-out action to compensate.  Also the Blu-ray transfer is excellent so definitely get this one for sure.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VMT89TCSF105.html">A2VMT89TCSF105</a><br/><p>Now, this is a *very* unrealistic movie, don't you think?<br /><br />Bruce Willis is back (fully clothed this time), and yes, he is impossible to kill. Neither choppers nor fighter planes can take him out. As usual, his adversaries are some kind of German-Russian terrorists. Naturally, a stereotyped nerdie hacker is part of the show, too.<br /><br />The top bandits lack personality, however. No scarred faces, no foreign accents, very little sociopathology, etc. The Asiatic woman looks like a stale computer animation. A hacker job, perhaps?<br /><br />This is a fan movie. If you actually liked "Die Hard", where Bruce was running around half-naked in a skyscraper for most of the time, or "Die Hard 2", with that fabulous plane crash, or "Die Hard and Zeus meets Simon Says" when you were 14 years old, you will *love* this one.<br /><br />If not, you will just say what me and my father said when we watched it the other day on Swedish cabel: "Now, this is a *very* unrealistic movie, don't you think?".<br /><br />:D<br /><br />Where's that fire sale, by the way?</p></br><a href="../users/A16QJ649N8PRV.html">A16QJ649N8PRV</a><br/><p>It would really be tough to top the previous movies in this series, but LFODH may have done it.<br /><br />This one involves a group of cyber terrorists who inflict widespread chaos on the nation in numerous ways.  The mayhem unleashed is mindboggling.<br /><br />In this installment, John McClane (Bruce Willis) teams up with young hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long) to try to stop the widespread damage being inflicted by Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) and his group of evil computer gurus.  Gabriel and his band are great villains and McClane is his usual top notch self in fighting the bad guys.<br /><br />Action fans will love this one.  Although the action is completely farfetched at times, it is still a fun time.  It may be necessary to suspend one's sense of reality for this show, but it is worth it.  This is really a great show.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Decent summer action flick; not quite as good as part one (a classic), better than part three, about the same as part two (which I enjoyed).

This time the bad guys are a collection of international criminals led by an ex-fed genius.  The good guys are led by John McClane of the NYPD, his whiz-kid sidekick, and various feds.  Like previous die-hard movies, we have lots of shooting, a gorgeous bad babe, some fistfights, and of course several helicopters, instead of just one as in the previous Die Hard movies.  The evil chic is played by Maggie Q, though this time we have a lady on the good side, McClane's daughter.  Much of the action takes place at night or in dark confines, so watch carefully or you will miss a lot of details.  Still, worth the 2 hours to watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Live Free or Die Hard starring Bruce Willis is the 4th installment in the Die Hard franchise. The last film was 15 years ago and John is still a tough as nails cop. Justin Long is pretty good as well, nice comic relief, always liked him on the t.v. show Ed. The stunts are pretty outrageous (that's a good thing), and the plot is intense, great music as well. I am not a huge fan of action flicks but this one is pretty entertaining, Die Hard 2 is the best in the series but Live Free or Die Hard shall make your aderaline pump profusely, enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I've never been a big Bruce Willis fan, but my goodness, does he ever deliver in this one.<br /><br />From beginning to end, you get the right amount of suspense, action, and nonstop excitement.  Lots of creative ways the bad guys die too, such as Bruce driving a truck through an elevator and watching them fall from way up high.  You get plenty of action scenes like those throughout the film.<br /><br />The shooting segments were very well done, and the helicopter scenes involving even MORE guns shooting were done spectacularly.  Great job.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>I miss the good old days of action flicks when they were helmed by great directors like McTiernan, Cameron, and Harlan and you had average Joes like Bruce, Arnold, and Sly saving the world.  Everything today is so CGI.  About the only actor today that meets the standards of yesteryear is Jason Statham.  The latest installment of "Die Hard" has it's cake and eats it too.  For sure there's alot of CGI but Willis makes you believe that he's getting his butt kicked by a Harrier.  The story combines post-911 paranoia, cyber-warfare, and old fashioned shoot-em-up in comvincing fashion.  The action in this flick never lets up.  In the center is Willis returning to the John McClane character like a favorite old shirt not unlike Harrison Ford in the recent Indiana Jones film.  So have your soda and popcorn or as McClane would have it a beer and hot dog and enjoy the fireworks.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>This "Unrated Version" offers the "Theatrical Version" as well.<br /> Running time: 2:08.<br />Yippee-Ki-Yay!

Behind-the-Scenes and music video.<br /><br />  This film is the best "Die Hard" film we have seen in a long time, although some of the special effects stretch the reality realm abit, but all this makes a great "Die Hard" movie we would watch again.<br /><br /> Update: A Good Day To Die Hard will be released February 14, 2013.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I'll start by saying this:<br /><br />If you are a fan of the `Die Hard' franchise and are afraid that the PG-13 movie is going to take away from the violence and realistic action that permeated the previous three films then place all hesitation aside and rent this movie anyways.  The violence here is so above any PG-13 I've seen as of late, realistic and non-stop.  In fact, the action sequences are more realistic and look better then anything seen in the mess that was `Spider-Man 3'.  Now, if you are a fan of the `Die Hard' franchise and are afraid that the PG-13 rating is going to take away from the many expletives that littered the first three films, again, have no fear for there is an unrated version that also accompanies this disk.  I personally don't care to listen to the F-Bomb dropped over and over so the theatrical version worked beautifully for me, but either way you have your pick and both are very pleasing.<br /><br />So, now we'll move onto the movie itself.<br /><br />Bruce Willis, now in his fifties, reprises his role as John McClane and once again proves that no one can do action like Bruce Willis.  The man is god, I mean at fifty he can still hold his own against just about anyone.  In this installment John is up against his toughest villain yet, a computer.  While the plot is underdeveloped a bit (does it really matter as long as enough stuff blows up) it still poses a situation we all can get scared over.  With the whole world pretty much dependant on computers what if someone decided to take complete control over them.  In essence they would control our lives.  So this is what McClane is up against.<br /><br />The film opens with McClane being asked to pick up a hacker named Matt Farrell and bring him in for some questioning.  Picking him up proves to be a little more difficult than expected and after narrowly escaping an assassination attempt on the kid he comes to find out that this hacker may be the only person who can help him through this mess.  At the other end of the attacks is disgruntled terrorist Thomas Gabriel (played by a very one-dimensional Timothy Olyphant) and his beautiful assistant Mai.  McClane's determination to take him down (and out for the count) ends up putting him in a a tight spot when Gabriel kidnaps McClane's daughter Lucy.  Now McClane has even more motivation to kick some tail.<br /><br />`Live Free or Die Hard' is very heavy on the action.  There are some breathtaking sequences and Bruce Willis' fight sequence with Maggie Q is the best `guy on girl' fight scene I've seen since Wolverine squared off with Lady Deathstrike in `X2'.  If you are in need for an action fix then this movie will do it for you. Tag this to the back of `Transformers' and you have one awesome action-packed weekend.  The whole `18-wheeler/jet fighter' scene alone is brilliantly shot and surprisingly realistic.<br /><br />Willis is great again here.  I don't know why people don't realize he is one of our finest working actors by now.  I mean, `drama' is not the only genre that demands you command your character and Willis' portrayal of McClane (especially in the first `Die Hard' film) is award worthy.  Justin Long is funny as Matt Farrell but I've seen him do better.  Maggie Q is awesome here, better than she was in last years `MI:3' and speaking of `MI:3', how come they get the greatness that is Philip Seymour Hoffman and we are stuck with Timothy Olyphant, who is never `great' but has been much better than he is here.  I was actually very impressed with Mary Elizabeth Winstead who plays Lucy, McClane's daughter.  She really got a handle on her character despite lack of lengthy screen time.<br /><br />In the end `Live Free or Die Hard' is much better than expected for despite it's PG-13 rating it still manages to deliver in just about every way the previous films had.  Sure, there is no comparison to the original `Die Hard' but this installment fits nicely with the rest and proves to be, not a disappointment, but a worthwhile adventure that is a sure fire crowd pleaser.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>but I watched the edited version on an airplane flight.

Set. Action!<br /><br />Action being the key word here. LIVE FREE OF DIE HARD (aka Die Hard 4) is an action-fest filled with wonderfully similar themes we've all seen in the first DIE HARD film. Bruce Willis (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFL2G6">16 Blocks</a>), of course, returns as officer-cum-detective John McClane.<br /><br />He's beat. He's tired. He's beat tired. But family always comes first, and McClane is first seen spying on his college daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MEYJI8">Bobby</a>), trying to protect for the wiles of the world. Naturally Lucy despises his attempts to protect her and storms off. Later, she will come to respect her father and proudly announce that her last name isn't Genero, but McClane.<br /><br />John then gets an assignment as a taxi. He's told to pick up a computer hotshot named Matthew Farrell (Justin Long, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HCPS94">The Break-Up</a>) and bring him to a special FBI task force that's tracking a string of computer crimes targeted at the American infrastructure. Once McClane and Matthew meet, it rapidly becomes apparent that somebody wants Matthew dead. Bullets fly. Bombs go off. McClane, again, is in way over his head ...exactly where Die Hard fans want him.<br /><br />A computer heist known as a "fire sale" is taking place in which everything vital to U.S. survival gets shut down. Traffic. Television and radio. Electricity. Everything that is currently run by high-tech computers is going off-line. Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) is the bad-guy who is initially seen as a terrorist but is later found to have financial aspirations (sound familiar?). When McClane becomes a pest, Gabriel soon turns to kidnaping someone close to the detective's heart.<br /><br />McClane and Matthew race to save America (and a family member) from a devastating computer meltdown. Car and helicopter chases, semi-truck and harrier jet encounters, all build upon the other until the final, fateful end.<br /><br />The dialogue between the computer illiterate McClane and the gurus of the internet are hilariously pulled off. The geeks can't get to where they need to be unless McClane blasts their way through, and McClane doesn't know what to do unless he's told by the geeks.<br /><br />A great fight sequence between Bruce Willis and Maggie Q (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XPU66U">Balls of Fury</a>) is something to watch for, especially since Willis' character ends up back in an elevator shaft (homage to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O77SRC">Die Hard 1</a>). It's also entertaining to see Willis' McClane get his butt stomped by the sexy Asian woman ...for a while.<br /><br />And let's not forget one of the coolest stunts seen on celluloid in some time: a car launch and crashing into a helicopter. Although completely unrealistic, it was amazingly awesome to watch.<br /><br />This is something Die Hard fans have been waiting for; another film that is overly-audacious and loaded with nonstop action scenes. It's flat-out fun!</p></br><a href="../users/A18OUQEK7IZ2F2.html">A18OUQEK7IZ2F2</a><br/><p>I watched this recently on cable, and while that fact led me to initially (and erroneously) excuse the otherwise unforgivable truncation of the trademark Yippie-Kai-Yay exclamation, I still enjoyed this fourth entry in the vaunted Die Hard franchise.<br /><br />Bruce Willis as John McClane is back and believable as a senior detective more concerned with his college-aged daughter's boyfriend trouble. But what makes this movie in my opinion is Justin Long (from "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNS4">Ed</a>," and the nerd from those Apple ads) completing the unlikely buddy duo. Timothy Olyphant is a little weak as the big boss, but Maggie Q picks up the slack and is BADA$$.<br /><br />So why only 3 stars? Well, as hinted at above, the language in this one is a little too clean. While I initially attributed this to a broadcast edit, the truth is even worse. All of the previous Die Hard films were rated R. In what I must assume was a misplaced effort to broaden the film's reach--as if people follow the guidelines, anyway!--this last entry was rated PG-13. The filmmakers reduced profanity, in some cases even muting dialogue post-production. As a result, McClane's climactic "Yippie-Kai-Yay, [f]other-[m]ucker!" packs less punch than the fat old guy from those Apple commercials.<br /><br />So DH4 loses a star there, and another for the truly unbelievable CGI toward the end of the film. (Especially the highway scene with the dueling semi and the F-35B. C'mon!) Let good actors act. Don't turn it into a cartoon! That scene almost killed the entire movie for me. You can get the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VNMMR0">Unrated</a> version, which will remedy the first issue, but sadly you cannot excise the CGI stupidity.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>The first three Die Hard films were thrilling,. This one isn't really in the same league, but it's not as awful as it seems. First off, I will say that it's really nice to see Bruce Willis return as John McClane. He's still awesome here as he was in the first three. Plus, the action is still exciting the fourth time around: lots of explosions and gunfights and car chases. Unfortunately, this film probably the most flawed in the entire series. One of the problems is the presence of Justin Long. Now, I don't have anything against this guy, but he doesn't seem to fit in the movie. He's more of a distraction rather than an ordinary supporting character. Secondly, the climax is very weak: compared to the climaxes in the first three Die Hard films, this one fails miserably. And finally, Kevin Smith's cameo was more aggravating than amusing. Even the joke about Boba Fett didn't hit the right notes. Basically, Live Free or Die Hard isn't as good as the first three, but it still has enough action and humor to hold your interest. It's still very fun.<br /><br />Grade: C+<br /><br />P.S., let's not forget about the first three Die Hard films.<br />Die Hard: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O77SRC">Die Hard</a><br /><br />Die Hard 2: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O77SRM">Die Hard 2 - Die Harder</a><br /><br />Die Hard with a Vengeance: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O78KW4">Die Hard with a Vengeance</a></p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>Live Free or Die Hard is a RELENTLESS action film, with killer stunts, wonderful special effects and a great plot.

And yet here I sit typing about the latest thrill ride featuring the character portrayed excellently by Bruce Willis as he battles the newest form of terrorism, cyber terrorists.<br /><br />Computer whiz Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Oliphant) has assembled pieces of a master planned puzzle by putting to use information garnered via internet and computer hacker geniuses. Unbeknownst to each, they are a giving him the tools needed to take down the country and increase his bank account at the same time. The best way to cover his tracks is to eliminate each one, which he does.<br /><br />Enter McClane who has been asked to pick up one of these hackers, Matthew Farrell (Justin Long), for the FBI for questioning when a hack on their systems is discovered. A normal pick up turns ugly when mercenaries show to make sure that Farrell never gets a chance to talk to the Feds. One raging gun battle later and McClane and Farrell are on the road and looking for help.<br /><br />Gabriel launches his attack in the midst of Farrell's being taken into custody, cutting into the traffic control system of Washington, D.C. and then into the entire broadcasting network system to create hysteria across the country. Locating McClane and Farrell, he dispatches a helicopter as well as rerouting traffic while the pair is in a tunnel. What follows is one fantastic assemblage of stunt coordination and special effects to make your adrenaline pump faster than a tossed car.<br /><br />As the movie progresses, the duo attempt to find out exactly what it was that Farrell helped assemble with his one small part. Attacks on the power system that controls the entire east coast, a computer area that holds more knowledge than it should and the kidnapping of McClane's college aged daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) turn things personal. Is there any doubt that a final face off between McClane and Gabriel will take place?<br /><br />This movie is not to be believed. No one could take the physical punishment that McClane does. No one can jump from an out of control jet onto a crumbling bridge and expect to survive. No one could dodge a car rolling through the air. And yet the answer is in front of you all the time...WHO CARES? This movie is not about actual physics or honest solutions to national problems. This movie is a roller coaster ride that gets the blood pumping, that makes you root for the good guy and that is nothing more than pure fun filled entertainment.<br /><br />The actors do their best between performing and being replaced by stuntmen when the danger ensues. Along with these stunt men and special effects people, they make this one fun flick to watch. Probably not suited for the youngest members of your house, but for everyone else, this movie is a blast and one worth adding to your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>This movie has non-stop action and big explosions. Yet it's so outrageously illogical that it's funny in many scenes. For example the scene on the brigde where Bruce did a lot of dangerous jumping and fighting. However, he got no serious injuries! No broken bones! There's no suspense at all.<br /><br />I found the first installment is more suspenseful.<br /><br />It's still worth renting.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>The stunts are amazing. Destruction and mayhem are in the extreme. The bad guys are intelligent and tough. The relationship between Willis and the young hacker played by Olyphant is entertaining. Using the daughter as the damsel in distress is a good idea. The original Die Hard is better, but this one is good and very exciting. I found myself saying aloud, "Wow!" at some of the stunts.<br /><br />The bad aspects are pretty minor for a movie like this. Multiple systems are hacked with less keystrokes than it would take to log onto most systems. There are highly improbably incidents that defy the imagination. Willis intentionally hits a flying helicopter with a car. No ramp or incline visible. A toy falls off a shelf and hits the delete key on a computer that is rigged to detonate a bomb at a very good moment for the good guys. I could go on, but I'll stop.<br /><br />The movie overwhelming strengths make up for the weaknesses. The Die Hard series have been remarkably consistent and "Live Free" is a good addition.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Fans of the Die Hard franchise were upset when it was announced that this film would be the first one in the series to be rated PG-13, an obvious bid to attract a younger audience. Thankfully, the more violent, profanity-laden unrated version is included on this DVD so that we can watch the film the way it was meant to be seen.<br /><br />The first disc includes an audio commentary by director Len Wiseman, actor Bruce Willis and editor Nicolas De Toth. Right from the get-go, all three men address the studio-imposed PG-13 rating thing and how they went ahead and shot an R rated version anyway. There are quite a few lulls as the three men tend to get caught up watching the film but manage to deliver a fairly decent track.<br /><br />The second starts off with "Analog Hero in a Digital World: Making Live Free or Die Hard," a feature-length documentary that can also be viewed as 10 separate featurettes. Wiseman admits to being a big fan of the series, especially the first one, and this motivated his decision to accept the gig. Various other aspects of the production are covered in detail, including casting the main roles, set design, stunts, editing, visual effects, and sound. This is done in an accessible way that is entertaining and informative.<br /><br />"Yippee Ki Yay Motherf*****!" Filmmaker Kevin Smith interviews Bruce Willis in this fun, entertaining extra. Smith flat out asks Willis why he decided to do yet another Die Hard sequel. He admits that mistakes were made on the second and third films and with this new one he was more conscious about not repeating those mistakes. Smith asks good questions which Willis answers them honestly.<br /><br />There is a music video for "Die Hard" by Guyz Nite, a pop punk band. The song pays tribute to the Die Hard films with a montage of clips from all four films.<br /><br />"Behind the Scenes with Guyz Nite" is forgettable look at this rock band as they talk about themselves and their music.<br /><br />"Fox Movie Channel Presents Fox Legacy" takes a brief look at the Die Hard franchise, giving a little backstory.<br /><br />Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F7CCPK4QL359.html">A2F7CCPK4QL359</a><br/><p>You know what you get for being a hero?

The action and the stunts are on the screen. However most of this we seen before.<br /><br />Willis is like a 1-900-be a hero when it comes to Die Hard movies. He is trying to stop  a computer mastermind who is  systematically shutting down the United States computer infrastructure. They crash the stock market, crippling America's economy. The plot seems intriguing but too out reaching for my tastes. Then on top of that, the mastermind kidnaps John's daughter Lucy, now its personal for McClane. Willis can wise crack at the most stressful times and makes it work.<br /><br />my favorite line from the movie is (after his car hit a helicopter in the air)<br />Matt Farrell: You just killed a helicopter with a car!<br />John McClane: I was out of bullets.<br /><br /> A hacker named Matt Farrell (Justin Long) (a throwback to Willis's  16 blocks)is saddled with McClane for this wild ride and it works in spots.<br />However Clerks and Dogma's director Kevin Smith plays Warlock and tends to steal every scene he is in. When he is off the screen, you wish he would come back<br /><br />This is standard Willis hero stuff.  There is a few nifty stunts, but the dialog is similar to the other 3 Die Hards.<br /><br />So this one is for Die Hard fans only<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD</p></br><a href="../users/AUSATFDSU2INS.html">AUSATFDSU2INS</a><br/><p>It's been twelve years since Bruce Willis yelled "yippeee-ki-yay" before dispatching the villain on turn in Die Hard With a Vengeance. After bringing his most famous character back to life, I'm happy to say that he's made a good decision and long time fans won't be disappointed with the new film: Live Free or Die Hard.<br /><br />The movie is a runaway success: the notable lack of CGI and very high stunt factor give the film a satisfying old-fashioned feel. There's also a lot of fun to be had in Die Hard 4.0 and that fun starts with Bruce Willis himself. His McClane is still pounding the streets but his hair has all gone. The script makes plenty of fun at McClane advancing years.<br /><br />The plot, of course, is overblown and predictable and I won't even dwell in an explanation that will leave us with more questions than answers. In short: A new villain is threatening to shut down America's power supplies. Only one man can stop him (we know who), and McClane is helped by a young computer hacker (Justin Long) to stop the potential armaggedon.<br /><br />What follows is one fantastically realized chase sequence or fight sequence or both after another, as McClane battles the baddies and gets progressively more torn up with each passing minute. But this is John McClane, so we know he ain't dying anytime soon.<br /><br />Each stunt outdoes the next, and the filmmakers don't waste a lot of time on little things like dialogue. Any talking is short and sweetened with one-liners. Director Len Wiseman keeps the action and humour coming thick and fast, but this is Bruce's show - and he doesn't disappoint.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>At first glance, the pieces don't look like much. We've see John McClane (Willis) before, so we know we can count on him for a testosterone-fueled rampage against the master terrorist. Then there's the master terrorist, with the requisite delusions of grandeur, threating all of Americas and John's personal life, as usual. There's a daughter to save, a nerd to protect, and - well, nothing really new here.<br /><br />So let's just get to the good stuff. The chases are great, which helps because most of the movie seems to be chases. Lots of stuff blows up and burns. Lots of cars go flying through the air, landing in ways sure to void the warrantee. There are lots of great fights, and some pretty spectacular set-pieces - that car in the elevator shaft comes to mind. And, when you want a really manly way to shoot the bad guy, wait for the end and see how McClane does it.<br /><br />It's a guy flick, with all the macho, witty quips, and damage to persons and property you could hope for. No grand themes or sensitive moments, but why would a real man want that kind of stuff anyway?<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release</p></br><a href="../users/A192KEPM0HW6AC.html">A192KEPM0HW6AC</a><br/><p>It's hard to believe that Bruce Willis's wisecracking NYPD detective John McClane has been absent from the big screen for a dozen years. With this blistering fourth installment of the Die Hard series, Willis seems to be laying claim to the "last man standing" title in the action movie genre. Which is appropriate, because almost twenty years ago, Willis and director John McTiernan (who returns as producer on this one) practically invented the smartass tough-guy action flick with their spectacular Die Hard, a film that promised--and delivered--"Forty stories of sheer adventure!"<br /><br />In the original, ruthless villain Hans Gruber (played by a suave, menacing Alan Rickman) and his Eurotrash henchmen took over and terrorized an L.A. high-rise to loot the Nakatomi Corporation's heavily guarded vaults. Like clockwork, everything went according to plan--except for one thing they didn't plan on: Hard-boiled New York police sergeant John McClane was in the building. McClane was visiting the City of Angels on Christmas Eve to salvage his marriage to wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), who had accepted an executive position on the West Coast to advance in the corporate world. When the goons started taking hostages, McClane started taking back the building, playing a bloody game of cat-and-mouse with Gruber and his gang.<br /><br />What made Die Hard an unexpected smash hit was McClane's sheer style. The sardonic cop hunted down the criminals and picked them off one by one, tossing off sarcastic one-liners and four-letter words while laying waste to the building. Audiences thrilled to this rollercoaster ride of a movie, not only for its spectacular action scenes, but also because it didn't star a muscle-bound hero like Stallone or Schwarzenegger. Willis's McClane was a regular working stiff, a guy who made up for his lack of brawn with quick-witted common sense and uncommon resourcefulness, persevering when all options for survival seemed exhausted.<br /><br />As he raced against the clock to rescue the skyscraper's occupants, the no-nonsense McClane didn't have time to go by the book. Half his battles were against LAPD and federal bureaucrats who did little except to dither and throw procedural roadblocks in his path. His combination of decisive action and impudence resurrected a distinctively American hero type--a throwback to Humphrey Bogart's wisecracking detective Sam Spade from The Maltese Falcon and Clint Eastwood's supremely insubordinate San Francisco cop, "Dirty Harry" Callahan. By movie's end, McClane had destroyed half the Nakatomi Tower, killed all the bad guys, saved the day, and won back the girl. What more could we have asked for?<br /><br />Die Hard's premise--"the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time"--has been copied numerous times since, in such movies as Speed and Passenger 57. It's become so formulaic, in fact, that when the third installment in the franchise, Die Hard: With a Vengeance, was released in 1995, the pairing of Willis with Samuel L. Jackson came off more like Lethal Weapon 3-1/2 than a sequel. The fine line between action and comedy, navigated so deftly in the first two films, veered too much into silliness in the third, with the racial-tension subplot between the two leads undermining whatever suspense the movie aspired to build. That, plus Jeremy Irons's hammy performance as Hans Gruber's vindictive brother Simon, made for an anticlimactic motion picture.<br /><br />Thankfully, with Live Free or Die Hard, director Len Wiseman delivers a genuine edge-of-your-seat action movie of the kind that's been missing from the big screen since Willis still had a head full of hair.<br /><br /> This go-around, John McClane is back and badder than ever. He's still a formidable S.O.B., still serving On The Job in New York, still barely staying on the wagon, still divorced, and still estranged from the kids. That estrangement doesn't stop him from tailing daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) at her Rutgers campus in the dead of night and forcibly removing her boyfriend from her parked car when the fellow gropes too far below her neckline. (Not that McClane really needed to--Lucy's tough enough to enforce her own borders.)<br /><br />He gets a call to drive down to nearby Camden and serve a warrant on suspected computer hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long) and bring him to FBI headquarters in Washington. Just as he's about to pick up his man, McClane gets pinned down in a hail of machine-gun fire from unknown assassins and barely manages to extricate Farrell.<br /><br />So the action begins. And the action doesn't let up for almost two solid hours. By the time the two get to D.C., we learn that Matt is one of eight hackers who had been recruited to write code for a mysterious employer with (unbeknownst to them) nefarious aims. Once they served their purpose, everyone was slain--except Farrell.<br /><br />As the sun rises, it's the Fourth of July--and all hell breaks loose. The nation's transportation infrastructure goes haywire as all traffic signals turn green, causing cars, trucks, buses, and trains to collide. When McClane arrives to transfer his prisoner to FBI computer-security agents, he realizes that Farrell is the only one who grasps the method behind the madness grinding every metropolitan area to a standstill.<br /><br />"It's a fire sale," Farrell explains to McClane and FBI agent Bowman (Cliff Curtis). "Everything must go." He means an Information Age equivalent of 9/11, with cyberterrorists taking over government computer networks and crippling America's transportation, financial, and public-utility infrastructures.<br /><br />In time, the pair discovers that the meltdown is the megalomaniacal revenge plot of &uuml;bergeek Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), who used to occupy a spot high up the Department of Defense food chain. For years, Gabriel had warned DoD officials that America's computer-network security was vulnerable. To prove his point, he had used a laptop to shut down NORAD. Rather than being given a commendation, though, Gabriel got the pink slip.<br /><br />Left to his own devices, technological dinosaur McClane wouldn't have had the savvy even to begin to hunt down the elusive Gabriel. And left to his own devices, wan hacker Farrell probably couldn't have beaten one of his own collectible action figures in a fair fight. But, thanks to the division of labor and the time-tested sidekick plot device, this temperamentally mismatched team is unstoppable.<br /><br />Charging through a rapid-fire series of action scenes, McClane is a human battering ram, taking out the bad guys and giving techno-wizard Farrell time to hack into the system and try to undo the damage. What a stroke of casting genius to pair the cantankerous McClane with the Mac Guy from Apple's TV commercials, in order to figure out the cyber pirates' next moves and head them off at the pass!<br /><br />This is a nearly perfect action picture, and just in time, too: I thought they forgot how to make 'em like this. For a movie so preoccupied with computer Armageddon, it eschews over-reliance on CGI special effects, opting instead for a stylized, yet gritty, look that never overwhelms the real with the virtual. Simon Duggan's adroit camerawork and Nicholas De Toth's editing hit all the marks, reasserting the brutal aesthetic of the original as the visual standard for action films.<br /><br />Like Bruce Willis's forthright portrayal of John McClane, Live Free or Die Hard is refreshingly Old School. McClane is a situational hero, not the mythological "One." There are no Matrix-style shots of him plinking bullets out of mid-air as he suspends time through Zen-like mental focus. In many ways, this is the anti-Matrix. When Asian siren Mai Linh (Maggie Q) puts her kung fu moves on McClane, the camera doesn't pan 360? as the two fighters go into Praying Mantis poses. Our hero just dusts himself off, gets behind the wheel of a Ford Explorer, revs it up, and slams her across the room and down an elevator shaft.<br /><br />Shortly after he launches a police squad car airborne in order to take out a helicopter, he and Farrell find themselves back on the road. Still shaken after being fired upon by Gabriel's henchmen, Farrell asks the seemingly detached cop what it's like being "a hero."<br /><br />"You know what you get for being a hero?" McClane fires back. "Nothing. You get shot at. Get divorced. Eat a lot of meals alone. Your kids won't talk to you. Nobody wants to be that guy."<br /><br />"Then why do you do it?"<br /><br />"Because there's nobody else to do it, that's why," he replies.<br /><br /> That's a real man's answer. Only a na?ve boy would set out to do heroic deeds; a man has the wisdom to know that true heroism is revealed when trying circumstances put character to the test. To a cop, being a hero means more than just showing up for work; it means seeing the job through. In the tradition of the best action heroes, John McClane does the dirty work most people can't or won't do.<br /><br />Like last year's Rocky Balboa, Live Free or Die Hard bookends admirably with its original. More than the previous two sequels, it captures the timeless spirit of the lone "cowboy" with a score to settle.<br /><br />At one point, Gabriel smugly mocks McClane: "You're a Timex watch in a digital age." But when he takes McClane's daughter Lucy hostage, he learns the hard way that McClane is also a ticking bomb.<br /><br />Yippie ki-yay, Mo' Fo's!</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>Live Free or Die Hard (aka Die Hard 4) is the perfect summer blockbuster - a smart popcorn fare with incredible action-packed sequences, outstanding special effects, smart dialogue, and a well-executed plot. It's the kind of movie Spiderman 3 wanted to be. It's the kind of movie that Pirates of the Caribbean 3 should've been. Instead, this summer, all the action/adventure belongs to a 52-year-old Bruce Willis Die Hard Collection (Die Hard / Die Hard 2 - Die Harder / Die Hard with a Vengeance), Perfect Stranger) reprising his role as the wisecracking New York cop John McClane.<br /><br />In 2001, Willis proclaimed that he would no longer do violent action or "save-the-world" movies. Had he stayed true to his statement, we would've missed out on one of the best movies of 2007.<br /><br />Live Free or Die Hard is the first respectable sequel in the summer of sequels. It is a great film not just for the Die Hard or action/adventure lover, but a great movie in general.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I did and I extend my full recommendation for it. It's truly a perfect Fourth of July movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X7FS1H4R02W1.html">A1X7FS1H4R02W1</a><br/><p>The is a great movie, Bruce Willis doing a bang up job that he always does.

I actually liked the movie more as it approached an hour or so into the mayhem. Bruce Willis did seem to be just going through the motions, especially early on, but he still had some clever lines and action scenes later in the film. Justin Long, as the helpless computer nerd, was much funnier than I thought he would be and really got the most laughs out of my packed theater.<br /><br />All in all, the PG-13 rating didn't hurt the violence one bit, but having John McClane not throw aroung the F word every few lines really felt out of place in a Die Hard movie. Even his famous line is muffled by a gunshot.<br /><br />Still worth seeing if you like mindless action, with a little humor thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Like most men, I have placed the original Die Hard movie at the pinnacle of macho-action films.  What made Die Hard so great wasn't just that it was an action movie, but that it was an old-fashioned tale of cops-and-robbers juiced with testosterone and lots of explosions.  John McClane (Bruce Willis) was an ordinary cop thrust into an extraordinary situation, an American-grown defender of justice given the opportunity to strike back against international invaders.  Or so it seemed; the joke was on us.  The original villain was actually just a petty thief, using the tactics of terrorists to cover his operations.  It was a stroke of genius and prescient insight into how the world really works.<br /><br />Part and parcel of McClane's "normal guy"-ness was his ability to withstand pain and keep functioning.  And for that to happen, McClane had to get beat up, stabbed, burned, and otherwise bloodied. McClane was cool in an old-school way; with his stubble, his mumbled asides, and his often-bewildered expressions, he was a fantasized version of every teenage boy (and adult) who didn't have leading man good looks or huge muscles. And he always had a personal stake; McClane was our National Guardsman, protecting his family from crime.<br /><br />As they say, the more things change, the more they stay the same, and so we're back to Die Hard once more.  This has to be the first action movie explicitly based on an article, John Carlin's 1997 "A Farewell to Arms" for Wired magazine.  Basically, the article details a "fire sale" - an attack that postulates the next major terrorist attack on America will include an electronic element, combining an electronic attack on the nation's infrastructure with a brute force physical attack.<br /><br />Into this mix is our pal John, escorting Matt Farrell (Justin Long, AKA the "Mac Guy") to a government safe house.  It turns out all the hackers who helped develop the codes to infiltrate the U.S. infrastructure are being eliminated, and Farrell is the only one to have escaped.  Thus ensues a new breed of buddy movie, "Boomer Meets Gen Y," and all the hilarity that entails.<br /><br />Live Free or Die Hard is as much about the consequences of cybeterrorism as it is about the differences in generations.  The dialogue between Farrell and McClane centers around these differences in understanding and accepting technology, and what it means to be a hero.  In the end, they discover they have a lot to learn from each other (awwww).<br /><br />The movie is not without its flaws.  The PG-13 editing is very noticeable; Willis resorts to grunting and groaning instead of swearing like he did in the earlier films.  He moans and groans so loudly that it starts to get comical.  There is not one but two unbelievable battles with aircraft that strain credulity, even for a Die Hard movie; I was willing to forgive Car vs. Helicopter, but Eighteen-Wheeler vs. VTOL Jet was just ludicrous.  VTOL jets are for taking off and landing, not having old-fashioned showdowns on bridges.  And yet, the special effects are so amazing that it's hard to nitpick.<br /><br />The other problem is the villain, Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant).  His disturbing actions are far more cutthroat and scary than his physical presence on screen.  As an actor, Olyphant just can't pull it off.  By the time McClane reaches him, you just want him to slap the kid upside the head and pull the plug on his computer. And of course, Gabriel's motives are no more noble than the villain from the first movie.<br /><br />In theory, there's a subplot about McClane's daughter, Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), but she doesn't have much to do here other than be a hostage.  On the other hand, there's the addition of Kevin Smith as Warlock, a superhacker, that's just hilarious.  To people who care about Star Wars and Kevin Smith, anyway.<br /><br />Live Free or Die Hard tries to have it both ways, appealing to the younger (PG-13 movie release) and older generations (unrated DVD version) and engaging them in a debate about what it is to be a hero. As a believable tale of one man saving the nation, it's often overshadowed by its big-budget special effects. As an action movie, it's a worthy entry in the Die Hard franchise.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Live Free or Die Hard a.k.a. Die Hard 4 brings to the screen another John McClane adventure.  This time terrorists have hacked into everything that is "hackable" and threaten to bring the United States to its knees.<br />Bruce Willis, Justin Long, Maggie Q (!) and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.  Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills.<br />The only major setback (as in the case of Next, The Legend of Zorro and other movies) is in relation to those "geniuses" that came up with the French-speaking Europeans as villains and with no explanation whatsoever as to their motive!  It's not as if there aren't enough prospective terrorists out there, they're lining up for crying out loud, so why go with some of the most unlikely candidates?<br />What European would even bother???<br />Nevertheless, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the special effects are all very good.<br />In conclusion, Die Hard 4 is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection, especially if you are a Bruce Willis fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A3B87UZLPCF0HW.html">A3B87UZLPCF0HW</a><br/><p>Die Hard 4.0 with Bruce Willis's teenage daughter becomes an unwilling bargaining chip to save the world. Her kidnapper is an insane state-of-the-computer-art terrorist. They have the computer codes to bring America to its knees. But you don't mess with the daughter of John McClane you are screwed big time. Non stop action, pissing people off, car chases, train wrecks, 18 wheeler wrecks--what fun on a huge, huge budget that can bring a hollywood movie, and CGI of course, all the way up to an A+.

I never tire of movies that are generated from plots about computers, so in the software and the hardware, the movie gets it right.  This time a terrorist is targeting hackers around the country, planting viruses in computers that detonate.  His motives are revealed later in the movie, but his maneuvering at his underground headquarters spread to sabotaging communications, energy, and traffic.  One of the most innovative scenes is when chief terrorist, Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) accompanied by cat-like siren sidekick (Maggie Q),creates chaos in an underground tunnel with traffic sorting out with the lights out.  (Often the whole affair comes off like a high-tech update of children's story `Gus the Firefly'.)<br /><br />Enter John McClane (Willis) who makes harrowing a weasel word for his escape with targeted hacker, (Justin Long) a startled petty criminal who becomes McClane's sidekick to restore order to the Y2K-like deliberations.  On the sidelines is McClane's daughter who is predictable bait and McClane's best motivation in a way reminiscent of 'Armageddon' (another Willis' movie).<br /><br />The mayhem keeps the adrenaline rushing, and, although Willis's smirks and funny lines are fewer and farther between, 'Live Free or Die Hard' shows there's still some new memory in the series' hard drive.</p></br><a href="../users/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K.html">A1S8AJIUIO6M9K</a><br/><p>This is not just a 5-star entertainment movie, it is a 5-star civic education movie.

When I first sought to turn the secret world toward open sources in 1988, getting the Commandant of the Marine Corps to sign off on an article "Intelligence Challenges of the 1990's," the USG would not listen to the Commandant.

This is Political Science 101, Economics 101, Ethics 101, Sociology 101.<br /><br />I especially liked the inclusion of ham radio in the movie.  Not only is the movie, the acting, everything superior, but someone really did do good homework here.  Ham Radio Operators were the first hackers, and the US Government, military, and law enforcement first attempted to drive them out of existence.  As the movie character says, "ham radio is end of the world insurance."  It will work when everything else fails.<br /><br />See also, in addition to the two above:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305047456">Hackers</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009RS0EM">Hackers - Wizards of the Electronic Age</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800141768">The Net</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K19E">The Matrix</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F7CMRW">Syriana (Full Screen Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471782661">The Art of Intrusion: The Real Stories Behind the Exploits of Hackers, Intruders & Deceivers</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0141000511">Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0962870005">Terminal Compromise</a></p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>When I first saw this flick, I knew it would be coming out unrated because I knew some fans werent happy with the writing and probably shyed away from this film. The PG-13 version was a pretty good action flick, one of the best of the summer. This is the age of the "unrated" dvds. Unrated dvds never really live up to the hype all it is usually contains nudity, a little more violence, and alot more swearing. Watching the unrated film felt like watching a kung fu movie. Watch carefully when Bruce drops an F bomb. His face is always covered, the camera is looking away, or his lips dont match the line. While some people might like the unrated version, it was laughable. Its like they knew some fans hated the PG-13 version so they went into the studio and overdubbed a few f-bombs for the unrated edition.

Right from the get-go, all three men address the studio-imposed PG-13 rating thing and how they went ahead and shot an R rated version anyway. There are quite a few lulls as the three men tend to get caught up watching the film but manage to deliver a fairly decent track.<br /><br />The second starts off with "Analog Hero in a Digital World: Making Live Free or Die Hard," a feature-length documentary that can also be viewed as 10 separate featurettes. Wiseman admits to being a big fan of the series, especially the first one, and this motivated his decision to accept the gig. Various other aspects of the production are covered in detail, including casting the main roles, set design, stunts, editing, visual effects, and sound. This is done in an accessible way that is entertaining and informative.<br /><br />"Yippee Ki Yay Motherf*****!" Filmmaker Kevin Smith interviews Bruce Willis in this fun, entertaining extra. Smith flat out asks Willis why he decided to do yet another Die Hard sequel. He admits that mistakes were made on the second and third films and with this new one he was more conscious about not repeating those mistakes. Smith asks good questions which Willis answers them honestly.<br /><br />There is a music video for "Die Hard" by Guyz Nite, a pop punk band.

Overall, it's a decent action flick, but it pales in comparison to the other three films. Yes, the PG-13 rating contributes to this sequel's downfall. While the other "Die Hard" flicks were edgy, violent, and full of swearing, "Live Free or Die Hard" is like the airline version of those three movies. The story is relatively to post 9/11 action films or TV series like 24. It's all about terrorism and villain Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) being the best computer programmer of all time hacks into every system that depends on the US government. This cause chaos and havoc in Washington DC meaning people are running around in misery and wondering what is happening and means attempting to kill a few hackers to stop them from stopping the cyber-terrorism such as Matt Ferrell (Justin Long.) Except he fails to kill Matt as John McClane saves his life. This gives us a good partnership for the rest of the film creating wit during the non-action scenes for example Matt taking the Mickey of McClane's lack of technological knowledge and good teamwork with McClane taking the Mickey of Matt's lack of knowledge on how to handle himself in a gun fight. With Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Lucy McClane being as mentally strong as her dad these three good guys make a very good team.<br /><br />Unfortunately the bad guys are less impressive as Maggie Q's Mai seemed stronger than the main bad guy that I nearly thought she was a character cross-breed from House of Flying Daggers and The Matrix which for a full throttle no holds barred film such as Die Hard 4.0 it is a tad bit silly. Timothy Olyphant did act his role well but he wasn't sinister enough or scary enough to be a memorable bad guy unlike Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber in the original Die Hard or else wouldn't the character of Lucy McClane be scared of him. MPAA has wrongfully put "Die Hard" under PG-13 where as apposed to it's predecessors had the wonderful R rating. You would think this would be outrageous which at times it is, there's no cursing and McClane's quote is nearly spoken in a whisper along with his legendary quote, "yippee-ki-yay motherf****r" is cut off by a gunshot.<br /><br />To sum up, I don't acknowledge this as a Die Hard film and don't consider it in the same canon with the previous films. To use the term from the movie, it's a firesale and one of the biggest sellouts in movie history. A PG-13 Die Hard? Please. Same goes for Bruce. He was my idol before he did this movie. Now, he's a sellout who claims that this is the best of the series. Not only that, he constantly bashes the 2nd and the 3rd films which is an insult to all 'Die Hard' fans, just like Live Free or Die Hard is.</p></br><a href="../users/A5AIEA4LXWJH3.html">A5AIEA4LXWJH3</a><br/><p>Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.<br /><br />The video quality of this Blu-Ray is great.

With this blistering fourth installment of the Die Hard series, Willis seems to be laying claim to the "last man standing" title in the action movie genre. Which is appropriate, because almost twenty years ago, Willis and director John McTiernan (who returns as producer on this one) practically invented the smartass tough-guy action flick with their spectacular Die Hard, a film that promised--and delivered--"Forty stories of sheer adventure!"<br /><br />In the original, ruthless villain Hans Gruber (played by a suave, menacing Alan Rickman) and his Eurotrash henchmen took over and terrorized an L.A. high-rise to loot the Nakatomi Corporation's heavily guarded vaults. Like clockwork, everything went according to plan--except for one thing they didn't plan on: Hard-boiled New York police sergeant John McClane was in the building. McClane was visiting the City of Angels on Christmas Eve to salvage his marriage to wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), who had accepted an executive position on the West Coast to advance in the corporate world. When the goons started taking hostages, McClane started taking back the building, playing a bloody game of cat-and-mouse with Gruber and his gang.<br /><br />What made Die Hard an unexpected smash hit was McClane's sheer style. The sardonic cop hunted down the criminals and picked them off one by one, tossing off sarcastic one-liners and four-letter words while laying waste to the building. Audiences thrilled to this rollercoaster ride of a movie, not only for its spectacular action scenes, but also because it didn't star a muscle-bound hero like Stallone or Schwarzenegger. Willis's McClane was a regular working stiff, a guy who made up for his lack of brawn with quick-witted common sense and uncommon resourcefulness, persevering when all options for survival seemed exhausted.<br /><br />As he raced against the clock to rescue the skyscraper's occupants, the no-nonsense McClane didn't have time to go by the book. Half his battles were against LAPD and federal bureaucrats who did little except to dither and throw procedural roadblocks in his path. His combination of decisive action and impudence resurrected a distinctively American hero type--a throwback to Humphrey Bogart's wisecracking detective Sam Spade from The Maltese Falcon and Clint Eastwood's supremely insubordinate San Francisco cop, "Dirty Harry" Callahan. By movie's end, McClane had destroyed half the Nakatomi Tower, killed all the bad guys, saved the day, and won back the girl. What more could we have asked for?<br /><br />Die Hard's premise--"the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time"--has been copied numerous times since, in such movies as Speed and Passenger 57. It's become so formulaic, in fact, that when the third installment in the franchise, Die Hard: With a Vengeance, was released in 1995, the pairing of Willis with Samuel L. Jackson came off more like Lethal Weapon 3-1/2 than a sequel. The fine line between action and comedy, navigated so deftly in the first two films, veered too much into silliness in the third, with the racial-tension subplot between the two leads undermining whatever suspense the movie aspired to build. That, plus Jeremy Irons's hammy performance as Hans Gruber's vindictive brother Simon, made for an anticlimactic motion picture.<br /><br />Thankfully, with Live Free or Die Hard, director Len Wiseman delivers a genuine edge-of-your-seat action movie of the kind that's been missing from the big screen since Willis still had a head full of hair.<br /><br /> This go-around, John McClane is back and badder than ever. He's still a formidable S.O.B., still serving On The Job in New York, still barely staying on the wagon, still divorced, and still estranged from the kids. That estrangement doesn't stop him from tailing daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) at her Rutgers campus in the dead of night and forcibly removing her boyfriend from her parked car when the fellow gropes too far below her neckline. (Not that McClane really needed to--Lucy's tough enough to enforce her own borders.)<br /><br />He gets a call to drive down to nearby Camden and serve a warrant on suspected computer hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long) and bring him to FBI headquarters in Washington. Just as he's about to pick up his man, McClane gets pinned down in a hail of machine-gun fire from unknown assassins and barely manages to extricate Farrell.<br /><br />So the action begins. And the action doesn't let up for almost two solid hours. By the time the two get to D.C., we learn that Matt is one of eight hackers who had been recruited to write code for a mysterious employer with (unbeknownst to them) nefarious aims. Once they served their purpose, everyone was slain--except Farrell.<br /><br />As the sun rises, it's the Fourth of July--and all hell breaks loose. The nation's transportation infrastructure goes haywire as all traffic signals turn green, causing cars, trucks, buses, and trains to collide. When McClane arrives to transfer his prisoner to FBI computer-security agents, he realizes that Farrell is the only one who grasps the method behind the madness grinding every metropolitan area to a standstill.<br /><br />"It's a fire sale," Farrell explains to McClane and FBI agent Bowman (Cliff Curtis). "Everything must go." He means an Information Age equivalent of 9/11, with cyberterrorists taking over government computer networks and crippling America's transportation, financial, and public-utility infrastructures.<br /><br />In time, the pair discovers that the meltdown is the megalomaniacal revenge plot of &uuml;bergeek Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), who used to occupy a spot high up the Department of Defense food chain. For years, Gabriel had warned DoD officials that America's computer-network security was vulnerable. To prove his point, he had used a laptop to shut down NORAD. Rather than being given a commendation, though, Gabriel got the pink slip.<br /><br />Left to his own devices, technological dinosaur McClane wouldn't have had the savvy even to begin to hunt down the elusive Gabriel. And left to his own devices, wan hacker Farrell probably couldn't have beaten one of his own collectible action figures in a fair fight. But, thanks to the division of labor and the time-tested sidekick plot device, this temperamentally mismatched team is unstoppable.<br /><br />Charging through a rapid-fire series of action scenes, McClane is a human battering ram, taking out the bad guys and giving techno-wizard Farrell time to hack into the system and try to undo the damage. What a stroke of casting genius to pair the cantankerous McClane with the Mac Guy from Apple's TV commercials, in order to figure out the cyber pirates' next moves and head them off at the pass!<br /><br />This is a nearly perfect action picture, and just in time, too: I thought they forgot how to make 'em like this. For a movie so preoccupied with computer Armageddon, it eschews over-reliance on CGI special effects, opting instead for a stylized, yet gritty, look that never overwhelms the real with the virtual. Simon Duggan's adroit camerawork and Nicholas De Toth's editing hit all the marks, reasserting the brutal aesthetic of the original as the visual standard for action films.<br /><br />Like Bruce Willis's forthright portrayal of John McClane, Live Free or Die Hard is refreshingly Old School. McClane is a situational hero, not the mythological "One." There are no Matrix-style shots of him plinking bullets out of mid-air as he suspends time through Zen-like mental focus. In many ways, this is the anti-Matrix. When Asian siren Mai Linh (Maggie Q) puts her kung fu moves on McClane, the camera doesn't pan 360? as the two fighters go into Praying Mantis poses. Our hero just dusts himself off, gets behind the wheel of a Ford Explorer, revs it up, and slams her across the room and down an elevator shaft.<br /><br />Shortly after he launches a police squad car airborne in order to take out a helicopter, he and Farrell find themselves back on the road. Still shaken after being fired upon by Gabriel's henchmen, Farrell asks the seemingly detached cop what it's like being "a hero."<br /><br />"You know what you get for being a hero?" McClane fires back. "Nothing. You get shot at. Get divorced. Eat a lot of meals alone. Your kids won't talk to you. Nobody wants to be that guy."<br /><br />"Then why do you do it?"<br /><br />"Because there's nobody else to do it, that's why," he replies.<br /><br /> That's a real man's answer. Only a na?ve boy would set out to do heroic deeds; a man has the wisdom to know that true heroism is revealed when trying circumstances put character to the test. To a cop, being a hero means more than just showing up for work; it means seeing the job through. In the tradition of the best action heroes, John McClane does the dirty work most people can't or won't do.<br /><br />Like last year's Rocky Balboa, Live Free or Die Hard bookends admirably with its original. More than the previous two sequels, it captures the timeless spirit of the lone "cowboy" with a score to settle.<br /><br />At one point, Gabriel smugly mocks McClane: "You're a Timex watch in a digital age." But when he takes McClane's daughter Lucy hostage, he learns the hard way that McClane is also a ticking bomb.<br /><br />Yippie ki-yay, Mo' Fo's!</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>John McClane was out pretty late<br />Watching Daughter Lucy on her date<br /><br />The guy's feeling frisky wants to give her a go<br />But good girl Lucy is saying, no, no, no<br /><br />He says, "Leave her alone, `cause I'm John McClane"<br />She says, "Leave me alone, John, cause that's no longer my name."<br /><br />Then things go from worse to dread<br />Just as Dear John is heading for bed<br /><br />He gets a call he should have been a slacker<br />The Feddies want him to pick up a hacker<br /><br />You see, hackers have broken in to the FBI<br />And they need someone to tell them why<br /><br />All he's got to do is pick up a Jersey kid and take him to DC<br />--well for John, how hard could that be?<br /><br />It was a simple job in the middle of the night<br />But, of course, the bad guys wouldn't let that work right<br /><br />They want the kid dead and they're not stopping at one<br />If they've got to, they're gonna kill John<br /><br />First, it's guns through the windows--and I'm not talking the OS<br />Then, the kid's computer explodes making his apartment a mess<br /><br />But, next the beginning starts seeming real slow<br />All the DC traffic lights have switched to GO<br /><br />All systems are starting to fail<br />The kid Matt says someone wants a Fire Sale<br /><br />What is that, the Feddies must know<br />The government, the money market, the utilities all blow<br /><br />But who'd do this dastardy deed?<br />A former employee, who's thoroughly teed!<br /><br />Gabriel told the Feds their system was flawed<br />And hacked into the Joint Chiefs thinking they'd applaud<br /><br />Instead of giving his genius the floor---<br />They kicked poor Gabriel out the door<br /><br />So to save this country he claims he loves<br />Gabriel's staging a fire sale without the kid gloves<br /><br />Now it's up to John and the hacker Matt<br />To see that Gabriel's plans fall flat<br /><br />They're faced with every kind of foe<br />When Death calls them, neither man will go<br /><br />When the bullets in his gun wouldn't last that far<br />John killed a helo with his car<br /><br />At last, they've taken Dear Lucy and that makes John mad<br />Not the best idea to p-off dear Dad<br /><br />But the girl's no slouch and she proves her worth<br />Makes those bad guys regret their birth<br /><br />Then after John delivers his trademark line<br />Matt the Geek tells John that Lucy looks mighty fine<br /><br />Now please excuse my humble verse<br />The movie wasn't the best, but it could have been worse!</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>"Live Free or Die Hard" sounds like a recipe for disaster.  It's directed by Len Wiseman, whose only previous credit worth mentioning is that he directed the "Underworld" movies.  It co-stars Justin Long, the obnoxious star of films like "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IZJZIU">Accepted</a>."  The plotline involves John McClane taking on computer hackers.  And the kicker?  It's rated PG-13.<br /><br />So imagine fans' surprise when the film begins receiving rave reviews, many calling it the best "Die Hard" since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O76T90">the original film</a>.  It enters the Internet Movie Database's Top 250 list.  It begins raking in the cash.  It's a hit.  Knowing all this, I went into "Live Free or Die Hard" with reasonable expectations and high hopes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I came out disappointed.  It's not that four "Die Hard" films is too many, nor that Bruce Willis has lost his touch.  A fourth "Die Hard" film could easily be stellar with a good writer and a talented director, and despite his age, Willis is just as cool as ever.  The first problem, and perhaps the most important one, is the rating.  For a PG-13 rating, the movie packs quite a punch, but the preceding films were known for their violence and profanity.  Willis' constant dropping of "F-bombs" was a big part of what made John McClane so appealing, because it emphasized that he was just an ordinary guy thrown into extraodinary situations.  As for the violence, it was part of what made the series so rough n' tough.  The worst part of it all is that it's clear executives pushed for a PG-13 to make more money, much like what they did with Paul W.S. Anderson's foolish "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AP04P6">AVP: Alien vs. Predator</a>."<br /><br />Now, without the ability to curse freely, John McClane seems a lot more quiet, a lot less ordinary, and more of a typical action hero.  He recalls Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name with his reserved cool and unflinching ability to kill.  Sure, McClane has his more down-to-earth moments, like talking to himself as he drives a car off a ramp and into a helicopter, and these are his best.  Fortunately, Willis has enough starpower to keep the character interesting, and make what we get of his trademark phrase, totaling "Yippi-ki-yay, mo--," hit home.<br /><br />The next problem: Len Wiseman.  Wiseman gives the film an honest effort, but he just doesn't quite fit.  He has style, but it's not the right style.  Wiseman's approach is slick and refined, unlike the gritty, tough, no-holds-barred style of previous directors John McTiernan and Renny Harlin.  Wiseman can't effectively handle tension, though he proves he's adept at effects-spectacular action sequences.  For the most part, though, they're just popcorn stuff.  There's no build-up, no surprise, no real structure to it: it's just smooth, effects-laden visuals.<br /><br />From Wiseman, all the other problems just sort of fold out.  The cast is young, fresh, and attractive, fitting Wiseman's general-audience approach.  Timothy Olyphant is a remarkably unmenacing villain when compared to Alan Rickman, Jeremy Irons, or William Sadler.  As predicted, Justin Long certainly has moments of obnoxiousness, but not unbearably so; still, a different actor could have done better in the role.  On the upside, Maggie Q adds some spark to her role, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead's zesty turn as McClane's daughter is fun.<br /><br />Mark Bomback's script is a big problem - it's dull, predictable, and by-the-books.  It lacks the originality of "Die Hard," the hopelessness of "Die Hard 2," the tension of "Die Hard: With a Vengeance."  The plot is thin and the scenes feel like they're just there to set up the action sequences.  To give some credit to Wiseman, he has enough skill to take the audience's mind off the lackluster plot line and keep them involved in the action.<br /><br />As a big fan of the previous entries, I really wanted to like "Live Free or Die Hard."  The cast and crew do put in honest efforts, but it just doesn't fit.  It feels like what it is, essentially: a PG-13 action sequel for the summer blockbuster season.  As your everyday action film, it delivers, but as a "Die Hard" film, it falls flat.  If there is one thing to praise the film for, it's the message that an old-fashioned hero like John McClane can still make a difference in our technology-ruled modern world.  But "Live Free or Die Hard," perhaps more fittingly titled "Die Hardly," will make a difference only to the most die-hard of "Die Hard" fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A37PV5GMP2ILJC.html">A37PV5GMP2ILJC</a><br/><p>Techies prove a point in this national security nightmare action drama, when a home grown terrorist masterminds a plan to shut down the entire country, one network at a time.<br /><br />Of course you can figure out that the one thing he forgot to factor into his programme was Detective John McClane, who is still around, albeit a little older, but still an ornery, stubborn, annoying pain in the rear, and as it turns out, still a force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />An analog guy in a high tech world, McClane is sent to pick up and deliver a computer hacker named Matt Farrell to the FBI, but as was the case in 16 Blocks, the delivery isn't as simple as it sounds.

The appeal toward the original Die Hard was that it did seem more real than your typical action flick but at this point in the series, a third sequel has no business being anything other than a $100 million quasi-self-parody. The film doesn't hide this and it really struggles to pull off even a partially real moment. However, holding it up to serious movies is not giving Live Free or Die Hard a fair shake, but then again its intentions do weigh in on my less then perfect rating.<br /><br />As a pure action movie and nothing more, Live Free or Die Hard is nearly perfect. My only complaint is it tried a little too hard to convince me on the computer hacking technology. Given the scene where Bruce Willis surfs on top of an F-35 Lightning II, it didn't need to dig too deeply into the technology jargon or convince me what was happening was real in any way. Too much time was spent on that stuff. I knew after about two minutes into the movie exactly what I wanted out of it; and that was some kung-fu, shooting, crashing cars and explosions. I just so happen to get some Jet surfing, collapsing bridges, elevators falling and utter urban chaos to spice things up even further.<br /><br />Anyway, the federal government is in big trouble as the FBI systems are breached by computer hackers who are basically contracted to do this from a terrorist group lead by a former federal big wig out for revenge after some political embarrassment (Timothy Olyphant in a very effective villain performance). The hackers are not really going to get paid though as they are systematically assassinated by these terrorists one by one after they've served their purposes. Enter Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis), who is told by a superior to pick up a hacker suspect (Justin Long). Great action scene as John rescues this guy from his assassination. John has to get this hacker to DC for questioning. Meanwhile, the traffic systems are collapsing and the stock market crashes. What is happening is an all out systems attack on vital networks of the government and the economy. Records are destroyed, transportation is ruined, utilities like water and gas are being manipulated, the media is taken over and fear propaganda is spread etc. You get the picture; the country is being driven into anarchy. That really just sets the stage. As things unfold the action just gets more and more exciting and ridiculous.<br /><br />I guess it is easier to do a pure action like this when we are already sold on the hero. If you've seen the prior films then character development for you is just not a necessity, at least for the protagonist. But Live Free or Die Hard does effectively present new characters for the most part. Maggie Q as a little kung-fu using sidekick and love interest to Olyphant's primary villain character is great, but on the other hand Mary Elizabeth Winstead is kind of annoying as Lucy McClane, John's teenage daughter. It is hit more than miss as far as that goes but that really shouldn't be the lens in which you approach a film like this anyway. Just sit back and enjoy. If you find yourself laughing and throwing up your arms at the level to which Live Free or Die Hard expects you to suspend disbelief, you are certainly not alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A3572FTYUQQW3P.html">A3572FTYUQQW3P</a><br/><p>Bruce Willis is my hero!!  He survives the most implausible and impossible situations and comes back to defend America and kill the bad guys.  He is a GOD!!  There are enough car crashes, car chases, explosions, bombs, bad guys, bullets, and dead bodies to satisfy the demands of at least a half dozen action movies.  I LOVED IT.  This movie shows John Maclane hasn't lost any of his moxie as he thwarts the bad guys who have launched a cyber attack on the US.  However, in a salute to political correctness the producers elected to make the bad guys disgruntled Americans intent on stealing money rather than the more plausible Muslims, who have actually sworn to destroy America.  But then by making the bad guys Americans the producers do get to show the world what a bunch of dumbbells the US government employs.  Still this is a small virturally irrelevant criticism because this movie is great.  It is guaranteed to get your adrenalin flowing and your testosterone to reach new highs.  John MacClane is a real super hero and a combination of John Wayne and Dirty Harry all roled into one.  Willis gets off some good wise cracks and his little nerdy friend also provides some good commentary.  This is a great film and I highly recommend it.  I wouldn't recommend it as a date film, but for guys it is a five star film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>It is too bad that Bruce Willis can't crank out this films more often.  John McClain is probably the greatest action hero in all film history and this installment packs a wallop with a slew of action and humor.<br /><br />McClain is asked to bring a suspected computer hacker to be interviewed by the FBI.  The actor playing this hacker is the guy who does the Apple McIntosh comercials.  It is interesting to note that he seem to prefer a Mac in this one.  Anyway, McClain shows up just as the hacker is about to be hit by the bad guys.  Were it any other movie it would be a guy with a magnum or piano wire, but being a Die Hard movie the bad guys come with ultra modern machine guns.  Of course McClain is able to take some of them out and temporarily get away with the hacker.  Thus we have the makings of a great partnership as good as any to the Lethal Weapons movies.<br /><br />The movie has you cheering throughout, especially when McClain taunts the head bad guy about offing one of his key henchpersons and then telling him I'm coming to get you.<br /><br />Kevin Smith has a larger cameo as Warlock, a live at home with his mother computer hacker.

The repeating of the same actions and expecting different results in the end.  We have the stereotypical Lucy Lui type asain karate spy champion attached to her white master.  A souless portrayal now that's entertainment.  Bruce Willis at least had some snappy dialogue, the only good part of the movie for me.  I wonder what kind of people find these type of movies enjoyable.  The masses seem to love this stuff.

He means an Information Age equivalent of 9/11, with cyberterrorists taking over government computer networks and crippling America's transportation, financial, and public-utility infrastructures.<br /><br />In time, the pair discovers that the meltdown is the megalomaniacal revenge plot of &uuml;bergeek Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), who used to occupy a spot high up the Department of Defense food chain. For years, Gabriel had warned DoD officials that America's computer-network security was vulnerable. To prove his point, he had used a laptop to shut down NORAD. Rather than being given a commendation, though, Gabriel got the pink slip.<br /><br />Left to his own devices, technological dinosaur McClane wouldn't have had the savvy even to begin to hunt down the elusive Gabriel. And left to his own devices, wan hacker Farrell probably couldn't have beaten one of his own collectible action figures in a fair fight. But, thanks to the division of labor and the time-tested sidekick plot device, this temperamentally mismatched team is unstoppable.<br /><br />Charging through a rapid-fire series of action scenes, McClane is a human battering ram, taking out the bad guys and giving techno-wizard Farrell time to hack into the system and try to undo the damage. What a stroke of casting genius to pair the cantankerous McClane with the Mac Guy from Apple's TV commercials, in order to figure out the cyber pirates' next moves and head them off at the pass!<br /><br />This is a nearly perfect action picture, and just in time, too: I thought they forgot how to make 'em like this. For a movie so preoccupied with computer Armageddon, it eschews over-reliance on CGI special effects, opting instead for a stylized, yet gritty, look that never overwhelms the real with the virtual. Simon Duggan's adroit camerawork and Nicholas De Toth's editing hit all the marks, reasserting the brutal aesthetic of the original as the visual standard for action films.<br /><br />Like Bruce Willis's forthright portrayal of John McClane, Live Free or Die Hard is refreshingly Old School. McClane is a situational hero, not the mythological "One." There are no Matrix-style shots of him plinking bullets out of mid-air as he suspends time through Zen-like mental focus. In many ways, this is the anti-Matrix. When Asian siren Mai Linh (Maggie Q) puts her kung fu moves on McClane, the camera doesn't pan 360? as the two fighters go into Praying Mantis poses. Our hero just dusts himself off, gets behind the wheel of a Ford Explorer, revs it up, and slams her across the room and down an elevator shaft.<br /><br />Shortly after he launches a police squad car airborne in order to take out a helicopter, he and Farrell find themselves back on the road. Still shaken after being fired upon by Gabriel's henchmen, Farrell asks the seemingly detached cop what it's like being "a hero."<br /><br />"You know what you get for being a hero?" McClane fires back. "Nothing. You get shot at. Get divorced. Eat a lot of meals alone. Your kids won't talk to you. Nobody wants to be that guy."<br /><br />"Then why do you do it?"<br /><br />"Because there's nobody else to do it, that's why," he replies.<br /><br /> That's a real man's answer. Only a na?ve boy would set out to do heroic deeds; a man has the wisdom to know that true heroism is revealed when trying circumstances put character to the test. To a cop, being a hero means more than just showing up for work; it means seeing the job through. In the tradition of the best action heroes, John McClane does the dirty work most people can't or won't do.<br /><br />Like last year's Rocky Balboa, Live Free or Die Hard bookends admirably with its original. More than the previous two sequels, it captures the timeless spirit of the lone "cowboy" with a score to settle.<br /><br />At one point, Gabriel smugly mocks McClane: "You're a Timex watch in a digital age." But when he takes McClane's daughter Lucy hostage, he learns the hard way that McClane is also a ticking bomb.<br /><br />Yippie ki-yay, Mo' Fo's!</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>I am a big fan of both Bruce Willis, who seems to move so easily from one genre to another, and the Die Hard films.  I was looking very forward to this film and happy to see the PG-13 rating which meant the extreme foul language and vivid violence of the previous films was now toned down to have wider audience appeal.  Some may feel this was a serious flaw with this entry, but I'm okay with this change.  However, I am not okay with the general storyline and this entry's villain as it is written and acted.<br /><br />While Justin Long makes a great sidekick for Willis and is very believable in his role, Timothy Olyphant is never believable as the villian and the plot's mix of his reasons for crippling the nation's technological infrastructure is completely silly.  First, he claims he's doing this to "save America" from "real" terrorists since he was fired and discredited when he demonstrated our nation's vulnerability.  Then he claims he should be paid for enlightening America and attempts a grand robbery.  Whether its Olyphant's inability to demonstrate any believable emotion or because the script is ludicrious, I just can't feel anything about the villain which was a major point with the prior films as they had very different, but interesting and engaging bad guys.<br /><br />The action and stunt work is awesome, but less believable than the prior films.  It all has that "we've got $100 million to blow and here it is" feel to it.  They really don't propel the story very much and while impressive, they really don't mean so much which, again, is contrary to the other films.  It's action for action's sake, thus, it feels rather empty.<br /><br />Inspite of my negative comments here, I did enjoy this film.  I just don't think it can hold a candle to the first three in which I gave four stars to each of them for originality, believable (most of the time) action, consistently good villains, and great casting.  This film just has too many faults in the areas that made the others so enjoyable and memorable.  I saw this film two weeks ago in the theatres and except for one or two scenes, I've just about forgotten the whole film already and that is not true of the first three which I still recall vividly.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>Could have been as good as the first two except for the presence of a very bland villain, easily surpassed by his beautiful and mean sidekick (Maggie Q). Two months after seeing this film I don't even remmember how the guy met his end.<br />The action scenes are as good as any in the first 3 films but unlike #1 & #2 the action is not limited to one specific place which somehow dilutes the excitment.<br />All in all, a superior action movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>I suppose in a world where everything is enhanced CGI or Virtual Reality the Die Hard franchise ought to take its already over-the-top formula to new levels of technological "try to top this."  Thus the stage is set for the fourth installment, cleverly entitled LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD.  Here we find a very middle-aged John McClane (yet the years have been kind to Bruce Willis) on his way to serve a routine warrant on a cyber hacker (Justin Long, who needs to calm down) wanted by the FBI for questioning.  Yet after three Die Hard death match marathons the viewer knows all too well there is never anything "routine" in McClane's shoot-'em-up life, and soon the two characters embark on a perilous adventure that makes suspension of disbelief the next special on Comedy Central.<br /><br />I know this is a Die Hard movie; I know this is Detective John McClane.  But. . .come on.  Plunging down a shaft, jumping from a semi on a crumbling freeway, clutching the wing of a spinning military jet--all while dodging semi-automatic gunfire or torched tons of TNT--is, perhaps, just a tad too much.  But again, this is the age of mind-boggling special effects, so there's no end to the death-defying predicaments the filmmakers gleefully subject their protagonist to.  Not even Superman would survive this kind of punishment.<br /><br />Willis is delightfully cranky, cantankerous, and curmudgeonly; Long needs to calm down (I think I have mentioned this); and cyber villain Timothy Olyphant definitely lacks the cold, calculated evil of his villainous predecessors.  LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD deserves three stars just because of all the eye-popping visuals, which are impressive, but really:  this franchise should have ended after Detective McClane rode off into the sunset after saving the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O77SRC">Nakatomi Tower</a>.<br />--D.

When the plane hovers over the interchange, and John leaps around like Mario crazed, it was over for me. Then, please explain how an individual is shot, remains standing, the bullet passes thru and knocks another across the room.????. This one killed the series, I hope all were well paid.</p></br><a href="../users/AVQJD41PLPOOQ.html">AVQJD41PLPOOQ</a><br/><p>First, let me say that LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is not only the worst film in the DIE HARD series, but one of the saddest, most desperate attempts to revive the popular franchise and make it "accessible" to today's younger audiences.<br /><br />The story centers on a group of computer terrorists led by a very, very young and angry man who is also a former member of our governement.  To prove a very radical point, he takes control of the United States by systematically shutting down our computer infrastructure.  And of course, being in the wrong place at the wrong time, it's up to John McClane to save the day.<br /><br />It seems that since the horrific events of September 11, 2001, we, as a country have learned nothing!  Not only did we go to war with the wrong enemy, but Hollywood film makers continue to get their kicks by seeing how much they can destroy our cities and people on screen.  In my opinion, a story about an American choosing to willfully cripple his own country in such a manner is nothing short of IRRESPONSIBLE!  Our foreign enemies need only watch a movie like LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD to be further inspired on how to attack our country again!<br /><br />I knew that I would not like this movie even before it started.  I mean, really, how much can you expect from any Part IV sequel??  I never expected to walk away feeling angry, though.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>For a long time fan of DIE HARD, I was pumped for this movie more than any movie that came out last summer, and I'll be watching this movie over and over and over again.<br /><br />Thankfully, with LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD, we don't get a group of terrorists peeling out of doors and walking in formation, or anything ripped from the previous films. The best thing though, is that it creates its own little twist on the 'wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time' theme, instead of copying the original like DIE HARD 2 did.<br /><br />Ultimately, LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is a typical summer blockbuster. In a majority of ways it's a cut above the rest, and in other ways, it's as ridiculous and unrealistic as a Devlin, Emmerich or Bay movie.<br /><br />The best thing about the Die Hard movies is that in keeping with the ordinary guy in an extraordinary situation, they've always kept the action scenes SOMEWHAT realistic. I mean, sure, McClaine has done some pretty crazy stunts, but they were always done realistically. Even the leap from the top of the building in the original was pheasible. If he hadn't jumped he would have died. In the third, the subway explosion was a little over the top, and more so, the explosion on the barge. I mean, they've always portrayed McClaine as overly brave, but ultimately vulnerable and most importantly realistic...<br /><br />...until the F35 scene.<br /><br />For that 10 minutes... I thought I was watching a lousy Michael Bay movie as the plane lowers itself perfectly, despite the overpass crumbling all around him and no fighter pilot would fly there in their right mind, except this one, just in the perfect location for McClaine to fall from the truck onto the wing and then miraculously cling to the wing as the plane hovers and dips, as if he had spider skills. (Maybe they knew that Spiderman 3 was their competition)<br /><br />I could go on and on about the ridiculousness of that unnecessary scene. Gotta please the popcorn poppers out there I guess. I mean... he's firing into OVERPASSES at a truck!! First of all... WHY? Second of all... HE'S MISSING!!!<br /><br />With the exception of that scene, LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD was outstanding. Thankfully, LIVE FREE has something that most action movies forget about. You can blow up everything in the world and have the coolest over the top action scenes on the planet, but until you have a sympathetic character that the audience can relate to and get behind... you have nothing.<br /><br />With DIE HARD you have it all.</p></br><a href="../users/A192KEPM0HW6AC.html">A192KEPM0HW6AC</a><br/><p>It's hard to believe that Bruce Willis's wisecracking NYPD detective John McClane has been absent from the big screen for a dozen years. With this blistering fourth installment of the Die Hard series, Willis seems to be laying claim to the "last man standing" title in the action movie genre. Which is appropriate, because almost twenty years ago, Willis and director John McTiernan (who returns as producer on this one) practically invented the smartass tough-guy action flick with their spectacular Die Hard, a film that promised--and delivered--"Forty stories of sheer adventure!"<br /><br />In the original, ruthless villain Hans Gruber (played by a suave, menacing Alan Rickman) and his Eurotrash henchmen took over and terrorized an L.A. high-rise to loot the Nakatomi Corporation's heavily guarded vaults. Like clockwork, everything went according to plan--except for one thing they didn't plan on: Hard-boiled New York police sergeant John McClane was in the building. McClane was visiting the City of Angels on Christmas Eve to salvage his marriage to wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), who had accepted an executive position on the West Coast to advance in the corporate world. When the goons started taking hostages, McClane started taking back the building, playing a bloody game of cat-and-mouse with Gruber and his gang.<br /><br />What made Die Hard an unexpected smash hit was McClane's sheer style. The sardonic cop hunted down the criminals and picked them off one by one, tossing off sarcastic one-liners and four-letter words while laying waste to the building. Audiences thrilled to this rollercoaster ride of a movie, not only for its spectacular action scenes, but also because it didn't star a muscle-bound hero like Stallone or Schwarzenegger. Willis's McClane was a regular working stiff, a guy who made up for his lack of brawn with quick-witted common sense and uncommon resourcefulness, persevering when all options for survival seemed exhausted.<br /><br />As he raced against the clock to rescue the skyscraper's occupants, the no-nonsense McClane didn't have time to go by the book. Half his battles were against LAPD and federal bureaucrats who did little except to dither and throw procedural roadblocks in his path. His combination of decisive action and impudence resurrected a distinctively American hero type--a throwback to Humphrey Bogart's wisecracking detective Sam Spade from The Maltese Falcon and Clint Eastwood's supremely insubordinate San Francisco cop, "Dirty Harry" Callahan. By movie's end, McClane had destroyed half the Nakatomi Tower, killed all the bad guys, saved the day, and won back the girl. What more could we have asked for?<br /><br />Die Hard's premise--"the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time"--has been copied numerous times since, in such movies as Speed and Passenger 57. It's become so formulaic, in fact, that when the third installment in the franchise, Die Hard: With a Vengeance, was released in 1995, the pairing of Willis with Samuel L. Jackson came off more like Lethal Weapon 3-1/2 than a sequel. The fine line between action and comedy, navigated so deftly in the first two films, veered too much into silliness in the third, with the racial-tension subplot between the two leads undermining whatever suspense the movie aspired to build. That, plus Jeremy Irons's hammy performance as Hans Gruber's vindictive brother Simon, made for an anticlimactic motion picture.<br /><br />Thankfully, with Live Free or Die Hard, director Len Wiseman delivers a genuine edge-of-your-seat action movie of the kind that's been missing from the big screen since Willis still had a head full of hair.<br /><br /> This go-around, John McClane is back and badder than ever. He's still a formidable S.O.B., still serving On The Job in New York, still barely staying on the wagon, still divorced, and still estranged from the kids. That estrangement doesn't stop him from tailing daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) at her Rutgers campus in the dead of night and forcibly removing her boyfriend from her parked car when the fellow gropes too far below her neckline. (Not that McClane really needed to--Lucy's tough enough to enforce her own borders.)<br /><br />He gets a call to drive down to nearby Camden and serve a warrant on suspected computer hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long) and bring him to FBI headquarters in Washington. Just as he's about to pick up his man, McClane gets pinned down in a hail of machine-gun fire from unknown assassins and barely manages to extricate Farrell.<br /><br />So the action begins. And the action doesn't let up for almost two solid hours. By the time the two get to D.C., we learn that Matt is one of eight hackers who had been recruited to write code for a mysterious employer with (unbeknownst to them) nefarious aims. Once they served their purpose, everyone was slain--except Farrell.<br /><br />As the sun rises, it's the Fourth of July--and all hell breaks loose. The nation's transportation infrastructure goes haywire as all traffic signals turn green, causing cars, trucks, buses, and trains to collide. When McClane arrives to transfer his prisoner to FBI computer-security agents, he realizes that Farrell is the only one who grasps the method behind the madness grinding every metropolitan area to a standstill.<br /><br />"It's a fire sale," Farrell explains to McClane and FBI agent Bowman (Cliff Curtis). "Everything must go." He means an Information Age equivalent of 9/11, with cyberterrorists taking over government computer networks and crippling America's transportation, financial, and public-utility infrastructures.<br /><br />In time, the pair discovers that the meltdown is the megalomaniacal revenge plot of &uuml;bergeek Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), who used to occupy a spot high up the Department of Defense food chain. For years, Gabriel had warned DoD officials that America's computer-network security was vulnerable. To prove his point, he had used a laptop to shut down NORAD. Rather than being given a commendation, though, Gabriel got the pink slip.<br /><br />Left to his own devices, technological dinosaur McClane wouldn't have had the savvy even to begin to hunt down the elusive Gabriel. And left to his own devices, wan hacker Farrell probably couldn't have beaten one of his own collectible action figures in a fair fight. But, thanks to the division of labor and the time-tested sidekick plot device, this temperamentally mismatched team is unstoppable.<br /><br />Charging through a rapid-fire series of action scenes, McClane is a human battering ram, taking out the bad guys and giving techno-wizard Farrell time to hack into the system and try to undo the damage.

Much-awaited, action-packed "Live Free or Die Hard" (also known as "Die Hard 4.0") lives up to our expectation with non-stop action sequences and snappy dialogues. But the most impressive is of course Bruce Willis and his character, NYPD detective John McClane, whose latest job "to just pick up a kid in New Jersey and drive him down to D.C." turns out a much more difficult one than he thinks.<br /><br />The film's nice idea is to pit a veteran NYPD cop against a group of cyber terrorists. Maybe I should not reveal too much here, but the fourth "Die Hard" film has something to do with the worst scenario of cyber terrorism in USA. If one man can stop that, it must be McClane, whose job is to save the good and kill the bad. The tough cop has to survive the attacks not only from a helicopter but from a military jet fighter and high-kicking kung-fu fighter. This sounds like a bad joke, but it really works.<br /><br />In fact, I was pleasantly surprised to see the great action sequences by director Len Wiseman, who avoids his MTV-like, heavily stylistic photography he used for "Underworld," but he instead shows more orthodox action storytelling that reminds us of John McTiernan who helmed the first and third "Die Hard" films. Moreover, those actins come with a healthy dose of humor, the same kind that made his character very popular and likable in the previous films.<br /><br />Bruce Willis may not be the most skillful or versatile actor in Hollywood, but he surely has charisma, and his commanding presence as John McClane, a nice, tough guy,  makes up for the numerous plot holes and preposterous episodes. Also impressive is the supporting cast, which includes Justin Long, Timothy Oliphant, Cliff Curtis, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Maggie Q, who is much better than in "MI3" with her martial arts skills. Kevin Smith appears as "Warlock" with several amusing references to "Star Wars."<br /><br />In short John McClane comes back. Slick and fast-paced "Live Free or Die Hard" is a thrilling and exciting action film, great 130 minute roller coaster ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A24KZBAAUTC83R.html">A24KZBAAUTC83R</a><br/><p>Underworld Director Len Wiseman does a fantastic job of giving us a new Die Hard movie.

Action films are usually my least favorite genre. Who cares! This was one edge-of-your-seat,formulaic,tense and funny film for pure entertainment. I didn't think about the plot or character angst for one minute. I was entertained and had fun. What I did enjoy was the seamless editing and Michael Kamen soundtrack for this film.This film was shot in my neighborhoods of Baltimore and D.C. and it was great fun watching the two cities shot and pieced together to make Washington. For those wondering about Woodlawn in the film, it is a Baltimore suburb where the Social Security Administration is located. The only thing that goes on there is the highest murder- rated neighborhood in the city!The packed theatre where I saw this film howled when we saw that!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Wow! I feel like such a man. After "Live Free or Die Hard", the 4th installment in the "Die Hard" franchise, my testosterone is at an all time high after watching John McClane (Bruce Willis) do battle with another group of bad guys. He kicks some butt and I feel all the more manly because of it.<br /><br />John McClane is asked by his supervisor to pick up a known hacker, Matt Farrell (Justin Long, the Apple commercials, "Accepted"), and transport him to Washington to be questioned by the NSA. The NSA has just had a major security breech in their system and they want to question all hackers who could have participated in such an event. As McClane arrives at Farrell's apartment to take him in, a group of hired thugs working for Gabriel Chase (Timothy Olyphant) arrive to kill Farrell; he is the last hacker who helped them with various pieces of the puzzle for their plan. Now he is expendable, so he must die. The bullets fly and McClane does everything he can to protect Farrell. As soon as they are in the car, the truth sinks in for Farrell and he can't come up with any reason why someone would want to kill him. They arrive in Washington, DC, just as the 4th of July Festivities are set to begin and things start to go wrong; the traffic lights go out, computers crash and a cryptic message plays on every television station. McClane knows they are in for trouble. Chase's men are still after Farrell, so McClane has to protect him and find out what connection he is. Then Farrell realizes what is happening; it's a "Fire Sale". Someone is attempting to shut down every computer system in the United States. In other words, they are trying to shut down everything. Will McClane be able to save Farrell, the United States and his daughter while uttering memorable catch phrases?<br /><br />Testosterone. This is the real reason I enjoy going to these films. As I have mentioned a few times, I love these Joel Silver-type action films, in which a hero has to fight against insurmountable odds to win the day (the girl, his family, his freedom, etc.). And there isn't a better example of this genre than the original "Die Hard" directed by John McTiernan and starring Bruce Willis. "Die Hard" is the story of an everyday guy, a cop from New York in Los Angeles to reconcile with his wife on Christmas Eve. Unfortunately, a group of terrorists, led by Alan Rickman, take the company hostage and McClane finds himself in the middle of a deadly situation. Great action, crisp dialogue, a fantastic villain and a likeable hero all help to make "Die Hard" one of the best action films ever made, and the template for many copies, some of which weren't bad either. With the inevitable sequel, director Renny Harlin placed McClane in the middle of an airport during a hostage crisis. Building, airport, both are enclosed environments, sort of. In "Die Hard with a Vengeance", Willis' McClane has to travel all over New York to outrun villain Jeremy Irons, while trying to keep his sidekick, Samuel L. Jackson safe. The sequels were fun, but they seemed to be pale retreads.<br /><br />With "Live Free and Die Hard", director Len Wiseman ("Underworld") places McClane in the middle of a cyber terrorist attack led by villain Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant, "Catch and Release", HBO's "Deadwood") and his crew of cyber hackers. Ooooooh, cyber - hackers. Scary.<br /><br />Olyphant is an interesting choice to play an uber-villain like Gabriel. He glowers and shows his thin smile on more than one occasion and these two elements help him look menacing, to a certain degree. Soft spoken, much like his character Seth Bullock on "Deadwood", he isn't a man you want to cross. And the fact Gabriel surrounds himself with so many guns and European goons make him even scarier. This is also a villain with a good, interesting plan to extract terror. As the film progresses, we learn he may have a closer connection to the rest of the plot than we initially thought, tying in his motive more concretely. I don't think anyone could ever top Alan Rickman in the first "Die Hard", but Olyphant does a nice job of creating his own persona.<br /><br />The addition of Maggie Q as Gabriel's girlfriend helps to amp up the danger quotient for McClane and Farrell. Maggie Q's character is completely devoted to Gabriel and his cause, and he is completely devoted to her, so she will do anything to help him. When she comes into contact with McClane and Farrell, she isn't going to give up easily and starts kicking and hitting, using every karate and martial arts move in her repertoire.<br /><br />Cyril Raffaelli, a French stuntman plays one of Chase's goons. After the attack in Farrell's apartment, as McClane and Farrell head for the cop's car, Raffaelli's character spots them and starts to bounce down the sides of the building, seemingly using exposed nails for his feet, to the alley below. I first saw Raffaelli in the Luc Besson produced "District 13", a French film with a lot of amazing stunt work, much of which is know as `Free running' or `Parkour', when the character seems to literally bounce from one spot to the next, moving at incredible speeds. Then in last year's "Casino Royale", Bond chased another practitioner of this kind of stunt work. Every time Raffaelli appears in "Live Free", the stunts take on a faster pace, making the action move at a breakneck speed. This helps to make the film all the more thrilling.<br /><br />"Live Free" has some amazing stunts, most of which were done with real stunt men and not CGI. The clip with McClane taking out an airborne helicopter with a car has been seen many times, but this happens in the first act. When I watched the film and realized this was happening early, I was a little disappointed. I was afraid they wouldn't be able to top it. But there are two more elaborate stunt sequences, one of which is so over the top; it is a lot of fun to watch. And naturally, there are a couple of good, old-fashioned hand-to-hand combat scenes "Die Hard" style. When McClane engages one or more of the bad guys, they are always willing to fight to the death, so McClane gets beaten up, bruised and bloodied.<br /><br />Both McClane and Farrell have a number of one-liners, which help to elicit laughter. But they don't seem to be added merely to make people laugh, they generally occur at tense moments, to help the audience relax a little. When Farrell manages to utter an amusing quip, it helps to show how scared he is. McClane is just a smart aleck and uses these lines to elevate his tense mood.<br /><br />In the best examples of these action films, the hero has to have a personal stake in the action, to make him continue to fight and battle with the villains. In fact, this has become a clich&eacute;. In some, the young hero meets a girl just as bullets start flying. He tries to protect her by dragging her out of harm's way and she becomes a part of the story because the villains mistake them for lovers. Of course, they will become lovers. This is an over-used and weak method of giving the hero a personal stake in the outcome. Just as naturally, this same girl will fall into the victim's hands before the end of the film. In "Live Free", McClane's daughter (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is added to the mix and it shouldn't come as any surprise that she will end up in Chase's hands, the formula can't deviate from that, but she proves to be a feisty young woman, very feisty indeed. Every time she exhibits this, she further proves how much like her father she actually is.<br /><br />"Live Free or Die Hard" is one of the better action films I have seen in the last few years, and a fitting sequel to one of the best action films ever. It is nice to see Bruce Willis in a role that we enjoy, welcome and embrace.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2<br /><br />After a twelve-year-long hiatus in which he was off doing other things, Bruce Willis finally returns to his signature role of NYPD detective John McClane in "Live Free or Die Hard," a pulse-pounding action film guaranteed to confirm every paranoid suspicion you've ever had that humans are indeed at the mercy of technology.<br /><br />In this installment, McClane has gone far beyond rescuing people trapped in a burning building; he's moved into saving-the-world territory as he takes on a disgruntled security expert who, after his warnings about massive system failure are ignored by the United States government, devises a plan to bring society to its knees through a mind-boggling display of techno terrorism.<br /><br />Director Len Wiseman doesn't fool around when it comes to giving the action audience what it's paid good money to see; from the very first scene, he shifts into full-throttle mode and never once lets up throughout the course of the movie.  In fact, so skillful is he at staging the elaborate action scenes that one barely notices that a mere human being like McClane winds up withstanding a tougher pounding than any genuine super-powered superhero ever have had to put up with even on his worst day.  Indeed, McClane engineers so many hairbreadth escapes and arises unscathed from so many predicaments that would have killed a lesser man ten times over that we begin to think he should be given a comic book of his own for all his efforts.<br /><br />Clearly, credibility is never a very high priority for any action movie, and "Live Free or Die Hard" compensates for its weakness in that area by being fast-paced, seamlessly stitched together and surprisingly good-natured despite the rather alarming body count it manages to pile up in time for the closing credits.  Nobody embodies the sardonic, wisecracking, stoic hero better than Willis, and even in his early 50`s, he displays an agility and athleticism that would turn many younger action stars green with envy.  Willis receives fine support from Justin Long, Timothy Olyphant, Cliff Curtis and the beautiful Maggie Q.  Although easily nine-tenths of the movie is straight-on action, writer Mark Bomback still manages to sprinkle in the requisite one-liners all such protagonists need if they are to be taken seriously as action figures, and he has fun with the irony that the bad guys with all their cybernetic gizmos and technological thingamabobs are no match for McClane's good old-fashioned ingenuity and brainpower.<br /><br />What would the world do without John McClane?</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Bruce Willis returns after 12 yrs as John McClane and he's in top form once again. Hackers are murdered and McClane is asked to bring a hacker named Matt Farrell (Justin Long) into custody. Right away McClane finds himself facing bad guys yet again. But that's not the half of it since they can hack into what ever they want and they use that technology to cause havoc in Washington D.C. They also use it to track McClane and control traffic so he has cars coming at him in all directions on top of bad guys shooting at him. So yet again, John McClane is in for one hell of a day.<br /><br />  Despite the plot being a bit silly the film still manages to work on a lot of levels. The action is fantastic even if it can be overly cartoonish and it helps that the effects are excellent as well. Most of all though it's easy to forget how silly the plot is when Bruce Willis is in top form. It also helps that Timothy Olyphant is in good form as the main villian. He's one of my most favorite under-rated actors and he is good here but still I have to say I liked all the main villians in the other films more. He's a cool actor and he trys hard but I still think Alan Rickam, William Sadler and Jeromy Irons were more menacing in the other films. Olyphant still is a worthy addition to that list even if he does come in last.<br /><br />  Justin Long trys hard too but he's no Samuel L. Jackson or Reginald VelJohnson (Family Matters) even. Still though, I admit he gives his best performance since.....playing a Mac. I think if they make a part 5, I'd like to see Taye Diggs play VelJohnson's son who McClane gets stuck teaming up with. This way we could get a cameo from VelJohnson since I actually think his performance was one of the best things about the original film. It's sad that now most people just know of him as the fat guy who Steve Urcle always pissed off lol. So anway I'd like one more film with appearances by Reginald VelJohnson, Bonnie Bedelia and William Atherton but as a retired newsreporter who's now married to McClane's ex wife Holly lol. Anyway from the first trailer I didn't expect much from this film but it delivers more than a lot of the sequels that were released this summer.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Live Free or Die Hard" is the 4th movie in the 19-year-old "Die Hard" franchise, and NYPD cop John McClane is looking a little elderly. After the FBI's computers are breached by hackers, Deputy Director Bowman (Cliff Curtis) of the agency's Cyber-Security Division wants every computer geek with the skills to have done the job brought in for questioning. NYPD officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) is asked to escort a young hacker named Matthew Farrell (Justin Long) from New Jersey to FBI headquarters in Washington, DC. But someone is out to kill Farrell, and the nation's transportation systems, financial infrastructure, and power supplies are being thrown into chaos by an unknown cyber-terrorist.<br /><br />The action is generally satisfying. The car stunts are not CGI. A confrontation between an 18-wheeler and a fighter jet is creative, if improbable. The script deflects some of the incredulity at seeing a 52-year-old Bruce Willis survive these stunts by poking fun at his old bones and low-tech approach. The plot and dialogue are silly even by action movie standards, however. The film simply alternates between action and geeks tapping on keyboards. Farrell's greasy-haired, socially inept computer geek stereotype is a couple decades out of date. Geeks are yuppies now. We see too little of villains Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) and Mai Lihn (Maggie Q), who seem more interesting than the people we do see. Good action, but "Live Free or Die Hard" has trouble maintaining interest and credibility between action sequences.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2007 Unrated single disc): There are 2 versions of the movie on the same disc, the theatrical PG-13 version and an unrated version with a little more gore and stronger language. The sole bonus feature is an audio commentary by director Len Wiseman, actor Bruce Willis, and editor Nicolas De Toth. Willis and Wiseman talk about the evolution of the characters and story, to which they contributed. Other topics of discussion include edits, the differences between a PG-13 and R rating, the creative crew, and filming the action. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish. Dubbing available in French and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>A mysterious figure named Thomas Gabriel in charge of a team of paramilitary cybercriminals finds a way to entice the world's best hackers to invoke a Fire Sale - an attack on the country's transportation, finance, then public works (what I like to call the Monopoly strategy) - in order to unleash his insidious master plan.  It's up to John McClane (Bruce Willis) to save the country, drop F-bombs, take a beating, and pick up Jedi hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long), the primary person responsible for making the Fire Sale possible.<br /><br />The flaws for this film are similar to Eagle Eye; there just happens to be too much nick-of-time, skin-of-the-teeth, missed by an inch fortune.  It's completely unfathomable, entirely impossible - regardless of how much background information is given on the genius and employment history of the primary antagonist - for a hacker, or team of hackers, to take over the entire Internet, telecommunication, DHS, NSA, FBI, CIA, and major power grids - evidently controlled by a Commodore 64 and administered by Windows ME - and even imagine the type of scheme attempted by Gabriel and his team, one of whom is the world's only Asian model/ninja/stunt-woman/computer hacker and another left Cirque De Soliel for a life of crime.  Despite the plot which left me incredulous, I thoroughly enjoyed Die Hard 4 because it's about action, not mundane reality.<br /><br />The acting from all three leads is top notch, as expected.  And why wouldn't it be?  Bruce Willis actually looks like a tough guy; Justin Long whines like a Jolt Cola drinking, World of Warcraft playing, basement dweller; and Timothy Olyphant cuts his eyes as a criminal mastermind like with the best of'em.<br /><br />The stunts are amazing.  Jets, trucks, and helicopters; mutilations, boxing, beatings, martial arts, and stair-diving; dorm room explosions, tunnel explosions, overpass explosions; it's the kitchen sink approach to action.<br /><br />If you need to be sold on this, you're probably in the wrong area.  Break out the popcorn and your suspension of disbelief, because Willis makes a triumphant return as McClane.  Yippee-ki-yay!!</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>Bruce Willis makes an awesome hero comeback as John McClane who tries to stop Internet terrorists who are shutting down the United States on the 4th of July weekend!

The first two sequels are very entertaining, but couldn't possibly live up to the original. 'Live Free or Die Hard' is a worthy entry in the series and the best since the original. Willis is in fine form and Justin Long proves he can hold his own. Fantastic action sequences and a tight story line will keep you on edge from beginning to end. The single disc unrated release has the theatrical release included as well as the unrated version. There is enough extra stuff on this one to keep me happy, but a two disc is available for "DIE HARD" super-fans. ;-b</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>"Realistic" is not a word that springs to mind in connection with the "Die Hard" films and "Die Hard 4.0" is no exception. Over the top action sequences, people who refuse simply refuse to die, and of course criminal masterminds who don't kill the "good guys" when they are given the chance - they're all here.<br /><br />For the most part it is unexceptional although it does contains one good over-the-top action sequence which - if it actually occured - would have resulted in many hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage!<br /><br />Bruce Willis's wisecracks and charm keep this one afloat.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>I and maybe a few other fans of the original Die Hard films were probably a bit worried about an addition to the series after all these years (and thank God it was an addition and not a remake which seems to be the Hollywood trend these days).  Die Hard is just impossible to beat, the very first one.  It is arguably the #1 action movie of all time.  Indeed, Live Free or Die Hard can't beat the classic, but I'd have to say it surpasses the others.<br /><br />The best thing about this film is the visuals and the sound.  I was blown away in the theatre, and just as blown away at home.  Visually, the effects are tremendous, accompanying several new and creative action scenes.  The sound is littered with gun fire, hard puches and kicks, and explosions througout the film.  You feel right in the middle of the action.<br /><br />The story is your basic Die Hard terrorist plot, but has been upgraded to the 21st century, focusing on computers and networking.  The terrorists take down networks causing mass panic begining on the eastern seabord.  John McClane once again finds himself in the middle of the action, and protecting a young man who had been targeted for execution after his services had been accomplished.  The lead villain, played by Timothy Olyphant, was as sinister as they come.  I enjoyed his character, but the actor could have been a bit sharper in the role.  His girlfriend, played by Maggie Q, seems to do most of his dirty work, and is skilled in martial arts, giving McClane one heck of an action fight mid-way throught the film.<br /><br />Though the story is intriguing because it ivolves all the high tech stuff this time, the real fun of the movie always comes back to the action - and there is more than plenty throughout the film.  The film begins with some great gun fire scenes - which carry the feel of a video game.  Oddly enough, there are multiple scenes of "Gears of War" on people's computers in the film.  There are some great car chase scenes, especially one where McClane takes out a flying helicopter with a car - huh? - its a must see to believe.  Then there's the finale with McClane in a big rig dodging heavy gunfire from a fighter jet between highway bridges.  Those are just some of the bigger action scenes, the list goes on and on.<br /><br />Overall, this is a must own action pleaser.  CGI has taken over in this Die Hard, but it is used to the fullest.  The characters do their jobs fine, and there is even plenty of humor to keep you laughing in and between all the action.  It is a perfect blend of serious action, fun charcaters, and good humor.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 5<br />Characters - 4<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4.5</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW.html">A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW</a><br/><p>I must say that although there were some incredible stunts and unrealistic scenes in the movie, I still thrilled in the fact that this was a well thought out, action, adventure story with a hero that I could believe. I love Bruce Willis and that crooked smile (I definately see what would attract Demi Moore) and his sense of taking a beating and keep on coming. Although John McClane was older and grumpier, he can take a punch or kick with the best of them. This installment in the Die Hard series finds John struggling to maintain his relationship with his college aged daughter. He has moved from being his daughter's hero, to being a disappointment. As he attempts to mend their relationship, he is also thrust into a situation where he has to save the life of a hacker. This story is filled with situations, that some would say are unrealistic, but that I say should give us food for thought. What would happen if there is a cyberattack and every industry that means something is effected? Finance, transportation, communications, and utilities. What if there were a firesale? Are we as Americans really ready? When John unravels the mystery of who is behind this mess, we find a bad guy and a bad, but beautiful girl. I really enjoyed this story and found it to be extremely entertaining. I even bought it to watch over and over on lazy Sunday afternoons.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>This film is a great addition to the line of die hard movies.  Bruce Willis brings back his classic NYPD police officer character John Mclain, who has a hero chip on his shoulder.  His family is in shatters, he's all alone, and low and behold, he gets the off duty call that he can't say no to, and is drug into a non-stop rollercoaster from there.  The action is non-stop, solid storyline, bit streached for how much damage one human body can take without dying.  Excellent film to pass time with.  Must see for any Bruce Willis, Die Hard fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>Or so I think Bruce Says.<br />Anyways, the unrated version is, as I have said about other movies which have been chopped to PG-13, the de-facto gold/good version. In this case, its more John McClane, More action than I could have thought possible, and they top themselves in so many ways in all the cool stunts.This is really a ride  and a half in the un-rated version.John is all analogue age action hero, and the "side-kick", is a very unlikely Black Hat Hacker, with an ultra Cool appearance by Kevin Smith, this all combines for a total blast.The Fight Sequences around the Elevator shaft and IN the shaft are very nail-biting. This is a must see in 5.1<br />The Commentary is just on the PG13 Version but explains a lot and adds a lot to the movie experience, a very nice extra.<br /><br />DVD Versions:<br />Careful what version you buy. It seems that the labelling on the first few US  batches has been messed up.The Single disc version clearly states that a Music Video and a Behind the Scenes is added, where-as the Double disc has this added feature on disc two. So, whats the story ? Hopefully someone will either sort the discs or proof the DVD covers. But, a minor<br />flaw.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Q6R4481YFFG.html">A14Q6R4481YFFG</a><br/><p>After all, don't we watch the Die Hard movies for Willis' laconic, ironic, iconic and insouciant style?  Sure, the plot is a shotgun marriage of "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory" and "Enemy of the State" but it doesn't really matter because Willis is there taking on the bad guys, giving us his deadpan, his sneers, his wisecracks, and great action as he once again saves the day.  New York, L.A. and New Jersey are lucky to have him as a cop!</p></br><a href="../users/A139ZF7CJVVTJU.html">A139ZF7CJVVTJU</a><br/><p>The original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SZK41M">Die Hard</a> was a cheesy masterpiece, a shot in the arm for the genre.  Watching it now, one is amazed at the number of cliches that the makers managed to cram into every crevice of the plot; they only seem like cliches now, though, because so many other action films have incorporated them so shamelessly in the interim.  Aside from the tired second installment (the working title was "Die Hard: In An Airport This Time!"), the franchise, even at this late date, shows considerable steam.  That is to say, if you like action movies, you should LOVE this thing.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is back, balder than ever, as John McClane, a New York cop who can never catch a break.  This time around, not only are homegrown terrorists sticking their fingers into every digital device in the country, but his daughter has also pretty much disowned him.  Timothy Olyphant (I will always know him as the stubbornly practical drug dealer from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767835093">Go</a>) is our Main Bad Guy, a national securities expert who was dismissed and disgraced by our country's leaders for daring to suggest that our computers needed a few more firewalls.  He returns with a giant truck full of fancy electronics and less-fancy hackers in an attempt to wreck havoc and steal money (or digital files that represent money these days).<br /><br />The start-up work for his Terrorist Inc. was done by a group of clueless computer nerds who have since been dispassionately dispatched of by a team of big-jawed foreign men with oversized guns (natch).  All of them, that is, except one: Matt Farrell, played by Justin "almost, but not quite, Tom Hanks, Jr." Long.  When the nation's head servers experience a troubling blip, every techno-geek in the country is summoned, and McClane is sent to grab Farrell.  Just in time to stop him from being ventilated and charred by the Vanload Of Henchmen.<br /><br />With America experiencing the national equivalent of a seizure (traffic systems down! phones no longer work! power goes out everywhere! walkie talkies hish annoyingly! the only thing on TV are old State of the Union speeches! Noooooooo!), it's up to the blunt force of McClane and the wire-wise smarts of Farrell to take down the almost-omniscient cyber-villains.<br /><br />Willis, as gruffly charming as ever, is starting to show his age here, but the movie actually capitalizes on that.  It means that he doesn't crack wise as often as you'd might expect, but it does give us a chance to watch him fuss over his grumpy daughter when she gets felt up by a lascivious (non)boyfriend.  It also makes a perfect counter-point to Long's stumbling sensibleness, an act he's perfected since his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IZJZIU">Accepted</a> days.  After a perfectly choreographed disaster sequence involving a dark tunnel, several dozen collisions, and a helicopter, McClane is noticeably hurt.  As the two limp away from the wreckage, Farrell says, "Hey, this is no joke.  You should go to the hospital.  I'm not a doctor, but it looks like you're hurt."  McClane grimaces and says, "Sexy, isn't it?"<br /><br />Even when McClane isn't wrily thumbing his nose at these ridiculous action movie conventions ("Where do you get all your henchman?" he asks Olyphant.  "Is there an 800 number you can call?"), he's waxing prosaic about the more human impact of being a hero.  In some movies, this would be the lag where you run to get a refill on your soda, but Willis and Long pull off the moment without resorting to overfed emotion.  It shows McClane at his most vulnerable, which makes the ensuing theatrics all the more exciting.<br /><br />For what it wants to be, "Live Free or Die Hard" is a rousing success.  In fact, I'm hard-pressed to think of anything that's wrong with the film.  It shows strides beyond the days of its granddaddy, and even if there is still a little cheese left in the series, it's served up glowing red and bubbling hot.  The lactose-intolerant should stay away.  The rest of you should have a seat, grab a snack, and say, "Yippie-kay-yay."</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>When cyberterrorist Thomas Gabriel (Olyphant) begins to take down America's computer systems, John McClane (Willis) gets the call from his superiors to pick up programmer Matt Farrell (Long).  Farrell has some idea of what Gabriel has done, and all of Farrell's colleagues have been killed.  Farrell is the last hope to stop Gabriel.  Of course, McClane is not the only one out to find him.  Gabriel's goons are looking to finish him off before he can be of any help to the authorities.  McClane foils their plans repeatedly, and as Farrell gets closer to shutting Gabriel down, Gabriel kidnaps McClane's daughter Lucy (Winstead) to use as leverage.  Of course, putting McClane's family members in danger has never really worked well for terrorists before.<br /><br />After twelve years, John McClane is back.  He is a older and a bit more hardened, but it is good to see him again.  I forgot how much I liked the "Die Hard" movies, and seeing McClane again was like seeing an old friend.  Bruce Willis still seems at home playing him, and I have a feeling that this movie will breathe new life into the franchise.  Olyphant is good as the bad guy, and Long gets the job done as the sidekick, although he may have a hard time living down those Mac commercials.  The story is scary enough to make you worry it could happen, but over the top enough to just be a bit too ridiculous.  All in all it is good fun though.  Those worring about the PG-13 rating watering down this R-rated franchise should not worry.  Nothing is lost.  I highly recommend this film as one of the best action movies of the summer.</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>This movie was everything I hoped it would be. Some movies I see the trailer and thats all that was good about the movie, but not this film. Hell, I saw it twice. The PG-13 rating kind of made me rethink seeing it but I did anyways.  There was a couple behind me who wouldnt shut up all the way thru it, but I still enjoyed it. A few parts didnt really fit with the story, but im not a nerd who picks at those kinds of things. Its a great addition to the series. John may be older and swear less, but the action is really heavy and there are a few good laughs thrown in. The best action movie of the year so far and probably all year.<br /><br />I also want to predict something. When this movie comes out on dvd, it will probably be given the unrated edition. I honestly dont know what they could add to the movie, it was perfect the way it was.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>Eclipsing the first "Die Hard" and easily breezing past its first two, good-but-not-spectacular, follow-ups, "Live Free Or Die Hard" is one of the most exciting, most fun, and overall best action films to come down the pike in a long time.  This one takes quite a different tract than the first two, which confined their action to a skyscaper and an airport, respectively, and shoots, chases and slams its way over much of the northeastern U.S. seaboard.  When a series of precisely co-ordinated computer attacks start bringing down systems and power grids all over the country, Bruce Willis (returning as John McClane once again) finds himself drawn into the thick of it - largely by coincidence as usual - and in his best race-against-the-clock yet.  Sidekick role this time goes to Justin Long, a small-time hacker initially arrested by McClane and subsequently helping to piece together all the clues as to the villains's identities and ultimate intentions, Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays McClane's daughter Lucy and is as great as always, and Kevin Smith has a couple of brief but scene-stealing appearances as cyber-wizard 'Warlock'.  The whole cast does great in this and makes a few scenes that might have otherwise been just Too unbelievable manage to work.<br /><br />Speaking of brushes with the unbelievable though, those who like their action movies as realistic as possible might find that the forth Die Hard goes overboard a couple of times.  There are some darn close calls even for McClane in this one, and probably nearly as many as in all three previous Die Hards put together!  Most times, this kind of thing, with disaster constantly being averted by uncanny combinations of sheer coincidence and plain luck, will send an action movie skidding right off the tracks.  Live Free Or Die Hard was one of the few where it didn't, and may have actually turned out to be a boon, adding to the fun and larger-than-life feel of the movie.  At times it's reminiscent of the 2003 Denzel Washington movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VJG72">Out of Time</a>, although that one is more dark and intense, and Live Free Or Die Hard more of a grand rollercoaster ride.<br /><br />Overall, unless you just dislike action/adventure movies altogether, Live Free Or Die Hard is one of the safest bets out there.  Those who find it a bit too over the top are still likely to enjoy it for the most parts, while those who don't think it went too far will just be blown away.  Before they did this one I thought it would be a bad idea to do another Die Hard.  After this I hope they go ahead and do a fifth.  When you can deliver this kind of a winner nineteen years after the first one you've got something really good going.  Scores around 9 or 9.5 on a ten point scale.</p></br><a href="../users/A3BJDFGSLXFB36.html">A3BJDFGSLXFB36</a><br/><p>I was a little skeptical before watching this film. Bruce has gotten much older since the original "Die Hard" and the world, as well as movies in general, have changed a lot. I was wondering if the latest outing in the Die Hard franchise was going to be a cheesy, tiresome, re-hash of what we've seen before.<br /><br />I'm happy to say that I was proven wrong. "Live Free" starts off with a bang and doesn't let up until the very end. Not only does Bruce pull off the role of a much older and much more cynical John McClane, he does it with style and believability.<br /><br />The stunts and action scenes are some of the best I've seen in a long time. The pace of the film only slows down long enough to fill the viewer in on some important details and plot devices and then gets right back to it. There was one stunt, however, that did seem a little too unrealistic to me (just watch for yourself and see if you can pick it out), which, for me, took away from the movie's credibility causing me to dedcut 1/2 of a star from the rating.<br /><br />The other half star was deducted from my review because of the strange coloration of the film. Everything seemed to be either black, dark blue, grey, or olive which gave the film an overall dark tone which, I guess, was done to match its doomsday theme. To me, though, it was a distraction. The other films in the franchise were colored normally, so why should this one be any different? Oh well. A little detail like this probably won't bother anyone else.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this one much more than "Die Hard 2" and "Die Hard: With a Vengeance", but not as much as the first "Die Hard". It's a great action film with an interesting premise, some terrific stunts, and amazing special effects and action sequences. This movie should be enough to satisfy any action film junkie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>No, this movie does not compare to the original DIE HARD.  Let's just get that out of the way right off the top, shall we?  I frankly can't imagine any movie comparing.  It was one of those rare movies that turns an entire genre on its head...or even invents a new genre.  How many DIE HARD rip-offs have there been?  Many of them awful...and many of them pretty good...but still, they are knock-offs.  SPEED?  DIE HARD on a bus.  Still a great movie...but it didn't feel 100% original.  DIE HARD did.  Simple as that.  I still watch that film and thrill to it...I may know everything that's coming...but it is so well-crafted and structured...so well edited and acted...you just see over and over why it is unmatched.<br /><br />LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is still a damn fun movie!!!  So what if it isn't DIE HARD...it's still one of the most exciting and outrageous films in a long time.  A formula flick that delights, surprises and satisfies on a gut level.  It promises a thrill-ride and it delivers.  It does not promise intellectual insight (and delivers none), great political commentary (arguably there is a little bit snuck in) nor would it ever claim to be a Best Picture Oscar contender.  And that's a GOOD thing.  It is fun!  And the kind of fun that only a movie can deliver.<br /><br />Willis is John McClain again...many years older.  His wisecracks are a little dispirited (at least at the beginning), not because the movie is unoriginal...but because McClain is a little burnt out himself.  We first see him spying on his teenage daughter to make sure the guy she's making out with is okay.  It's a funny situation, but it's a little sad too.  Here's this guy who has basically saved thousands of people from obliteration...and he still can't get his personal life together.<br /><br />He is quickly thrust into saving the life of a computer nerd (Justin Long), and wouldn't you know it...this is no ordinary case.  This is another world-shaking, cataclysmic terrorist event in the making...and only McClain can save the day!  Yep, you just want to roll your eyes...but 99% of you just smiles, kicks back and relaxes.  You know you're in good hands.<br /><br />Willis really delivers.  He knows how to play this part with his eyes closed...but the great thing is, he doesn't coast.  (He has coasted in the past...but to his credit, Willis is one of the most physically committed actors around...he seldom just phones in his work.)  And he is well-matched with Justin Long.  Talk about an odd-couple!  Naturally, as the movie progresses, and Willis saves Long's life for about the 100th time, Long grows to respect this artifact of a by-gone era.  And Willis grows fond of this nerdy kid.  Nothing earth-shattering there...but their by-play is so well-done that it feels, if not fresh, at least well-thought out.<br /><br />Maggie Q is in the Alexander Gudonov role...you know, the henchman to the main bad guy...the one who almost never talks but can sure kick some serious butt.  She is extremely physically in her role, and she and Willis have a brutal and brilliantly stage (and super exciting) fight scene.  This alone almost makes the entire movie worth seeing.  It's one of the best fight scenes in a long time.  Outrageously unlikely...but only made more enjoyable for that fact.<br /><br />Speaking of bad guys...Timothy Olyphant plays the master criminal, and it's an odd casting choice.  He's supposed to be one of these mild-mannered, soft-spoken but oh-so-dangerous psychos.  Sadly, he mostly comes across as mild-mannered and maybe a little peeved.  The plan he's executing is a lot of fun (I won't spoil it...but suffice it to say that he wants the world to go REALLY low-tech), and the details of it are enjoyable to follow...but Olyphant is only really weak link in the acting chain here.<br /><br />The stunts in this movie are among the most jaw-dropping I've ever seen.  Apparently, the more ridiculous the better...and again, it's that sense of glee, that sense that the filmmakers know perfectly well that what they've constructed is entirely without credibility...that makes it WORK!  I've never laughed more at stunt work...but in a good way.  I was almost like a little kid, ready to just clap my hands and stamp my feet in delight.<br /><br />LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is a totally "big-studio, money-grabbing, escapist summer movie."  But it shows that sometimes, that kind of film, well-done, is exactly what the doctor ordered.  If you enjoyed DIE HARD...you should love this film too.  It doesn't reinvent the wheel...but it sure makes the biggest, loudest, most awesome wheel you've seen in a long time!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3F9VH8916IA40.html">A3F9VH8916IA40</a><br/><p>this is quite simply the best Die Hard movie there is, nay, the best action film of the summer (I didn't' see the third Borne movie so I can't compare it to that). sure the action is over the top, sure the story may be a bit of a stretch (I hope) and sure the whole daughter thing may have been a bit cheesy, but it's all worth it to see McLane shoot himself though the shoulder to hit the bad guy behind him. Classic.<br /><br />What's not to love about this movie? Unless of course you want realism in which case you may be out of luck. McLane blows up a Copter with his car, some Asian chick keeps fighting after being rammed against a wall with an SUV, our hero takes a ride on the outside of a flying fighter jet, but hey, it's all in good fun. As long as you don't think about it too hard, this movie will definitely make you sit on the edge of your seat. Enjoy. if you read this review, please leave a comment.<br /><br />Replay value; Very high.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>"Live Free or Die Hard" exists entirely within its own universe, one ruled by nonstop action sequences that are anything but realistic. I guarantee that anyone who sees this film will not in the least be interested in the plot, nor will they invest in any of the characters. They will see this film only to watch Bruce Willis engage in combat, dodge explosions, and perform daredevil stunts. This film accomplishes exactly what it set out to accomplish, and for that, I suppose a four-star rating is appropriate. But keep in mind that not everyone will appreciate this kind of filmmaking; it may be an escapist movie, but goodness gracious, how many action sequences can an audience handle in one sitting?<br /><br />In all fairness, I appreciated that this film wasn't bogged down with details from the first three "Die Hard" films. Anyone who hasn't seen them will have nothing to worry about; the character development in this new film remains exactly the same, and there are no continuing plotlines. In other words, anyone new to this series doesn't have to bother with renting the first three films. What a relief; you pretty much get three films worth of action in this one, anyway. I can't recall a recent film that was so aggressive, so overloaded with eye candy that it overwhelms everything else. Maybe that's why, on some strange level, it works; it never stops to take a breath, and thus doesn't allow the audience to move back from the seat's edge.<br /><br />But there's absolutely nothing to get out of the story, something so implausible and ambiguous it begs the question of why the filmmakers even bothered with a screenplay. The plot can basically be described in one sentence: NYPD officer John McClane (Willis) and computer hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long) go after cyber-terrorist Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), a man systematically gaining control of the country's power supplies. There's really nothing more about the story that needs to be explained. For that matter, there's nothing about the story to understand; Gabriel's motives are a complete mystery throughout most of the film, and by the time they are revealed, we really don't care anymore. It all boils down to the fact that he's the bad guy, and the good guy is trying to stop him. It doesn't get any more basic than that.<br /><br />The progression of scenes is essentially guided by the potential for action; most scenes featuring McClane begin normally before turning into frenetic battles. In one scene, he's assigned to find Farrell and bring him in for questioning. As soon as Farrell is found, the scene becomes engulfed in gunfire; someone has sent assassins to kill Ferrell. Later on, they drive on a road in Washington, D.C. The traffic lights are eventually taken over by Gabriel, resulting in numerous car accidents, ugly pileups, and more shooting. And then they find themselves in a long tunnel. Gabriel attempts to kill them by allowing cars to enter from both ends. For extra fun, the tunnel lights are shut down. I can't begin to explain the significance of any of this. Then again, I suppose an explanation isn't necessary.<br /><br />Thrown into the mix is McClane's daughter, Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a character who adds nothing to the film other than an excuse to create extra conflict. She only uses about twenty minutes of screen time, the first five of which establishes that she and her father aren't getting along (she hates using his last name). The other fifteen minutes sees her in Gabriel's evil clutches, and of course, McClane has to save her. When compared to the film's entire length of 130 minutes, I think it's easy to understand why her character is insignificant. This isn't to say that her character hurts the film; the action is far too abundant for any of the characters to be troublesome. Quite simply, this is not a character-driven film. Even the inclusion of Kevin Smith as a caricature hacker doesn't change things too much.<br /><br />So then what is this film driven by? That's easy. It's driven by cars that fly upwards and ram operating helicopters. By semi trucks that zoom across collapsing freeway overpasses. By shootouts, explosions, fighting, and characters hanging from perilous heights. By Willis having yet another opportunity to say, "Yippie ki yay [expletive deleted]." Everything is quick, loud, and in your face. Whether or not it's actually entertaining is open for debate; some will be thoroughly entertained while others will be begging for aspirin when the end credits start to roll. I don't dare reveal which category I fall into; believe me, it's enough that I'm actually giving this film four stars.<br /><br />But I'd be lying if I said that I took this film seriously. There's nothing about it that indicates seriousness, which I'm sure is exactly what the filmmakers wanted. "Live Free or Die Hard" is definitely a mindless film, but at the very least, it's a mindless film that knows what it's doing. Therefore, it delivers exactly as it promises. No attention was given to anything other than the entertainment factor; audiences sure like to see things blowing up and people flying through the air. If this is what you crave from a movie going experience, then by all means, go see this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB.html">A3M6RVUVZOQZLB</a><br/><p>When I clicked on the movie and scrolled down to the reviews, I fully expected reviewers to bust "Live Free or Die Hard" for its exaggerated action showing McClane coming out of each sequence with minimal injuries. However, I was pleasantly surprised to discover how much praise the movie had received, not only for the action, but for an aging McClane/Willis. As I continued to read the reviews, the idea of hero archetype began to unfold in my mind.<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW<br />If you have seen the movie, please follow the flow of action: Archetypal hero is given a quest (task--Police Chief: Pick up a hacker), overcome all sorts of obstacles (action scenes are plentiful and incredible), rescue the kingdom (United States), kill the villain (hacker supreme), and rescue the princess (daughter, check) and marry her. No, but the subordinate Matt (hacker frontline) is becoming "that man" and a declaration of interest is made. "That man" is in reference to Matt's questioning McClane: Why do you do it? Answer: Because I am the only one.<br /><br />With McClane as archetypal hero (think Luke Skywalker and Hans Solo; Viggo Mortensen in LOTR), he must have a specific quest. In this case, Save America from the Fire Sale: Everything must go." Since the beginning, Americans have sought to conquer a frontier. We sailed across the seas in ships. We traveled by wagon over the land until we reached another ocean. We made airships and traveled into space. Americans--always restless, always moving, always seeking. Now cyberspace and virtual reality have become the new frontier.<br /><br />That takes us to the kingdom: cyberspace, specifically America's cyberspace. This film serves as sirens, clanging bells, bullhorns--as warnings that America is under imminent attack from cyberspace terrorists. We had best prepare ourselves. Matt's line: I thought it would be cool to see if it (Fire sale) could be done. McClane: We're not talking about computers here, we're talking about people. This is about people. "Fire Sale" in cyberspace/hacker terms refers to the destruction of the infrastructure: transportation, utilities, financial institutions, all run by computer.<br /><br />Thomas Gabriel is the Dark Side (Darth Vader), both originally on the kingdom's side, each turning for individual reasons. Gabriel becomes the catalyst for McClane's actions in saving the kingdom. Gabriel explains that it is better for one of "us" to bring down the kingdom than an outsider. Really? Destruction is destruction is evil.<br /><br />In another point, McClane not only represents the archetypal hero, but portrays some elements of the Wise Old Man, another obvious archetype (Obi Wan Kenobi, Gandalf, Merlin). The very mention of McClane's age invokes this vital archetype--hero into Wise Old Man. If there is a sequel, will John McClane become New York's Chief of Police? No, I see Chief of Homeland Security ahead with Justin Long's Matt as his second in command. What will John do in this position? Is he up to it? I think so. By then he WILL be the Wise Old Man.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>It has been awhile since the last "Die Hard" movie, but this enjoyable summer thriller shows the franchise still has life.  Bruce Willis is surpisingly effective in reprising his role as John McClane, now a lieutenant of detectives in the NYPD, divorced, and trying to run herd on a stubborn teenage daughter.<br /><br />McClane is still a blunt instrument-style cop with a bad habit of turning up at the wrong place at the wrong time. In this case, a cyber attack on computer networks in D.C. prompts a request from the FBI, a quick pickup of a geek computer hacker named Ferrell that turns into a fire fight in a quiet neighborhood in Camden, New Jersey. McClane and Ferrell surive the firefight to discover they are caught up in a cyber "firesale", designed by disguntled former DoD cyber security genius Thomas Gabriel (played with youthful menace by Timothy Olyphant) to shut down critical infrastructure all along the Eastern Seaboard.  McClane and Ferrell (appealingly played by Justin Long) humorously work through a generational cultural gap while figuring out Gabriel's plan.<br /><br />The movie is a series of spectacular and increasingly improbable action sequences stitched together by McClane and Ferrell's pursuit of the bad guys from New Jersey to Washington, D.C. to the Maryland countryside and finally to the Baltimore waterfront.  Along the way, McClane's daughter and Ferrell are taken hostage.  The final showdown between McClane and Gabriel is in keeping with the traditions of the franchise.<br /><br />The producers were wise to honor the backstory of John McClane; his characteristic mutterings to himself while about to perform some dangerous act will draw knowing laughs from fans of the franchise.  The basic storyline is ripped from today's headlines, but the solution in this case is a dinosaur, die-hard cop.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as summer entertainment to fans of "Die Hard".</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002B15WE">Die Hard</a>" was ranked as the greatest action movie ever made by "Entertainment Weekly" last week and the 1988 film remains an important touchstone for a lot of what has followed in its wake (e.g., "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GANOQ">Speed</a>" was sold as "'Die Hard' on a bus").  It has been a dozen years since the third time Bruce Willis has played John McClane, mainly because it took a decade to come up with a story and script that would justify the return.  I expected the wait would be worth it because Willis obviously has been holding out for something worthwhile, just like Spielberg, Lucas, Harrison et al. have been taking their time getting around to a fourth Indiana Jones movie.  So, here I am back from the theater where my wife informed me during the end credits, "This was a good movie."<br /><br />I would say it was a very good movie.  Not as great as the original, but according to "EW" no action movie is, so that is hardly a damning comment.  John McClane is still a detective with the NYPD and still divorced, whose current personal headache is that his daughter, Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is not speaking to him, or calling him dad for that matter.  Then the FBI cyber-crime department gets hacked and McClane gets a call to pick up a local hacker and brining him to Washington, D.C. for questioning.  The only problem is that McClane arrives at the apartment of Matt Farrell (Justin Long) just ahead of a bunch of guys with big guns.  Somebody wants Farrell dead and it clearly has something to do with the cyber-terrorists who are starting to take down the nation's infrastructure one computer controlled support at a time.  Farrell knows about "mutating algorithmic security codes," "fire sales," and how to use a laptop to control down the world.  McClane knows how to take down a helicopter without bullets.<br /><br />Len Wiseman, director of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001WTUH6">Underworld</a>" and "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F6IOC0">Underworld - Evolution</a>," directs the fun that came from merging Roderick Thorp "certain original characters," namely John McClane and his grown up daughter Lucy, with John Carlin's article "A Farewell to Arms" (you can find it on the Internet).  Carlin wrote all about the "soft-destruction" that can result from an "I-war," a term that refers not to an Internet War but rather an Infrastructure War.  But this is a "Die Hard" movie and that means whatever people might be thinking or saying about what is going on, it always comes down to the same thing in the end. That, of course, is but one of the key elements in a "Die Hard" movie, the others being that the situation ends up being personal, improvising ways of getting out of sticky situations alive, receiving help from unlikely stories, and having to save the day because nobody else is in a position to do it.  All that plus bleeding a lot.<br /><br />There are all sort of little in-jokes with regards to the previous files (take a wild guess what it the name of the FBI agent McClane runs into) and well as obvious homages (e.g., fireballs in the elevator), and even if you have not see any of the previous three films recently you will still recall enough to get a lot of the self-reflexive moments.  I am surprised that Timothy Olyphant is not quite as intense as he was on "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006FO5LO">Deadwood</a>" as the villain, and Kevin Smith actually shows up without his glasses in an interesting role, but it is Long whose character is smart enough to do the right think sooner rather than later and Winstead who proves she is daddy's little girl who stand out in support of Willis.<br /><br />However, we all know that ultimate an action movie comes down to the stunts, especially now that CGI is available to up the ante.  The gold standard is from the original movie when the roof is about to explode at Nakatomi Plaza and McClane wraps a firehose around his waist and jumps off.  This was pretty damn exciting in 1988 and as I recall the scene was THE clip they showed from the movie (stopping when McClane landed in the room and before the wheel at the other end stared dragging him down).  But today, such a simple but powerful scene does not cut it.  So there are cars spinning through the air or flying up to take down helicopters and fighter jets shooting missiles.<br /><br />However, I think the best stuff in this movie are moments other than what stands out in the trailer.  The initial shoot out at Matt's apartment is probably my favorite sequence from the film and all of that computer movie magic is not as cool as when Wiseman gets the camera to swing around one of the cars that McClane is driving like a maniac.  So every time they ratchet up the special effects I found myself taking a step back from the movie instead of being drawn in.  After all, the point of using Carlin's article as a springboard is because something this horrible could really happen, which creates some dissonance when contrasted with McClane rolling around on top of a fighter jet.  Consequently, for me the decision to round up or down was going to come to the climax and what happens when our hero finally gets around to saying his "Yippee Ki Yay" line once again.  Would then go "old school" or "high tech"?  The rating above should give you a clue and "Live Free or Die Hard" should be the biggest blockbuster this summer because to date it is far and away the best.  However, I did not recognize the piece of classical music they play in the second half of the end credits, and that is going to bug me to no end for the foreseeable future.</p></br></body></html>

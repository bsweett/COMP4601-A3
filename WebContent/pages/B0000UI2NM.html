It is a battle between Lycans and Vampires.<br /><br />From the music to the dark set.  This movie is awesome!  You get pulled into the movie at the opening when you see Vampires watching the city and then they go in for the hunt because they see Lycans are in the city and following someone.  It starts out with action as they start a whole scene fighting one another.  It is not your typical love story it is more based on Vampires vs. Lycans but you get a sense of love with Kate and Scott.  But it in now way takes away from the action you feel in this movie.  You will not be displeased with this movie it has a lot of cool special effects and the blood going into Viktor  was neat.  I love when they also walk into the house and the cool techno music was playing and the Vampires were just all sitting around while they crew walked through.  It is a great movie with great heart.  I read some reviews and not sure why so bad I usually hate movies like this but I love this one!</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>Underworld starts out with a long action sequence. Things do slow down enough for us to learn that our hero is a vampire by the name of Selene, played by Kate Beckinsale, who has devoted her unlife to destroying lycanthropes. Selene stumbles upon a conspiracy between the vampire leader, Kraven, and the werewolf leader, Lucian, which involves a human named Michael, who is a host to a strain of some strain of plague that is never explained. Fearing that Kraven's actions may place the vampires in jeopardy, Selene does the unthinkable; she awakens the ancient vampire noble, Viktor so he can stop Kraven.<br /><br />In the middle of the movie we move away from some of the action and we get our characters doing a lot of talking, plotting, and running through dark wet streets. We get all of our back-story of how the vampire/werewolf war got started in the first place via flashbacks. And there's a forbidden romance budding between Selene and Michael.<br /><br />The movie looks sufficiently offbeat to be interesting, although the muted colors and lack of anything resembling bright light becomes does get a little old. Be nice to see what the vampires did when the sun was up. Kate Beckinsale does look dangerous and sexy in a skintight leather suit, but there is not much acting for her to do in this film. Scott Speedman doesn't need to do anything more than exude a primal wildness, which he succeeds at. And everyone else has to appear sinister.<br /><br />Even though, I found Underworld be an entertaining view. The big battle at the end is fun, although the final scene seems to be an introduction for a sequel. So get your popcorn, and watch the movie. You will not be sorry...though it is no one I will be watching multiple times.</p></br><a href="../users/A20ZFWGBY4REFX.html">A20ZFWGBY4REFX</a><br/><p>About a day ago, I managed to see "Underworld" at the theater, and this is what I think about the film...OUTSTANDING!! "Underworld" has so much action, unrelenting suspense, and mind-blowing special effects that make "Blade" seem like a walk to grandma's house! With intense direction by first-time director Len Wiseman, "Underworld" has an excellent cast led by the lovely Kate Beckinsale ("Cold Comfort Farm", "Pearl Harbor") in what is sure to be one of the best performances ever in her career. Joining Kate are Scott Speedman ("Dark Blue", "Duets"), Michael Sheen ("The Four Feathers"), Shane Brolly ("Impostor"), and Bill Nighy ("Love Actually") in which they, too, gave outstanding performances.<p>"Underworld" focuses on a thousand-year war between vampires and werewolves. Centered in the middle of the war is Selene (Beckinsale), a beautiful vampire warrior, or "Death Dealer" as she calls herself. She exists solely to slaughter a band of werewolves known as "Lycans" that her clan has been battling for centuries. Although she is aligned with the vampires, Selene falls for a human turned werewolf named Michael Corvin (Speedman) after she discovers a Lycan plot to kidnap him. When the Lycans try to make their next move on Michael, Selene is there to fend off their vicious assault. As Selene races to save Michael and unravel the Lycan plot, Selene then discovers a secret that has terrifying repercussions for both tribes -- a secret which threatens to tip the balance of power in favor of the werewolves who have been on the losing of the struggle for centuries. And as far as Selene goes, she must decide if her future with Michael is worth betraying her own people.<p>In conclusion, "Underworld" has it all! Great action, a powerful storyline, and a pulsating soundtrack that is sure to please just about anyone looking for a spectacular action film. And I especially can't wait for the sequel, especially since the end of "Underworld" was left wide open for one! "Underworld" is, without a doubt, a DVD must-have to my Kate Beckinsale collection! And all I have to say is "Look out, Angelina Jolie! There's a new girl in town, and her name is Kate Beckinsale!"</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>UNDERWORLD, a faced-paced, in your face, kick-a** monster movie, tries to answer that age old question.  Vampires and Lycans (werewolves) have been at war for untold centuries.  Very few even remember how the blood feud started.  But the crossing of a Vamp with a Lycan has always been forbidden.  Or has it?<br /><br />UNDERWORLD is action-packed from the get go; you jump right in and it never lets up.  Epic battles, high-speed chases, gun fights, impossible stunts, blood and gore (although less than you would think), and fantastic transformations keep you on the edge of your seat.  The directing/cinematography/editing are excellent, cutting away from anything truly disgusting before you really see it; leaving the rest to your vivid imagination.  The acting is impressive, with Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, and Michael Sheen all giving scene-stealing performances.  The rest of the cast, including Bill Nighy, are equally good in there respective roles.  And let me just say, the costuming for UNDERWORLD is marvelous:  gorgeous dresses, fabulous leathers, skin-tight cat suits.  I'd like to go shopping were the Vamps do!<br /><br />UNDERWORLD includes all the universal Vampire and Werewolf lore - sunlight kills Vamps, silver kills Lycans, you become a Vampire or a Werewolf from a bite.  Not too many surprises in this area (although these precepts are taken to new heights), making it easier to keep up with the plot.  But added to the standard lore is the theory that there is a line of humans who carry a gene that enables them to survive a bite from BOTH a Vampire and a Lycanthrope.  And this is what the Lycans are looking for.<br /><br />Even if you aren't a fan of monster flicks, you will enjoy UNDERWORLD.  It makes for a great popcorn evening at home.  It is clearly too intense for the youngest members of the family, but tweens and up should be just fine.<br /><br />So, what DO you get, when you cross a Vampire with a Lycanthrope?  Apparently, something the Lycans want and the Vampires don't.  And something bigger and badder than both...</p></br><a href="../users/A331OF34UX4Y1K.html">A331OF34UX4Y1K</a><br/><p>Man, this woman is simply gorgeous!!! And gorgeous in a natural, simple way, and not a silicon-Botox-fake blond way. But that would be useless if she could not act. But she can, and Underworld was the perfect example to demonstrate it (unlike that awful thing called "Pearl Harbor"). She took a simple but complex role, and made the best of it, not overacting, not becoming a cliche, but giving the character a lot of "fuel" (Carrie Ann-Moss should have learned from her when she played "TRINITY" in both sequences of MATRIX...)<br /><br />And, sometimes, I just don't understand critics. This movie received a lot of backlash. Sue, it's far away from perfect, but critics are always complaining of brainless action flicks, with no substance (Bruckheimer-kind of movies)... UNERWORLD is nothing liek that. It constructs its history slowly and carefully, until reaching its climax.</p></br><a href="../users/A38N7SFDOB3MR3.html">A38N7SFDOB3MR3</a><br/><p>Underworld is the story of the war between the Vampires and the Lycans (werewolves); a war that has been raging for over a thousand years. One of the great things about Underworld is that it takes  Vampire and Werewolf lore and fleshes it out, avoiding tired cliches, leaving us with a very fresh story.<br /><br />One could call this movie an action movie, but even though there is quite a bit of good action, it is at its heart a great story. There are unexpected twists and turns, and the writers go out of their way to avoid many of the pitfalls of using tired Hollywood cliches. For example, there is an attraction between a Vampire character and a Werewolf, but it never deteriorates into cheesiness. We are left wondering what happens after the movie ends as opposed to being tortured with loves scenes that would have been out of place in a flick such as this.<br /><br />Those who don't have much of a taste for action movies and monsters might hate Underworld, and those who think Anne Rice's universe is the only one that matters might hate it as well (because it breaks tired vampire cliches), but those looking for a fresh monster story will love it. If you liked Van Helsing, this movie is right up your alley.<br /><br />Understand that Underworld is not perfect, but it entertains. The story does drag at times when the action sequences seem to go on forever. The fight scenes start to blur into one big fight. But I was left wanting more. The worldbuilding was great. Anytime I walk away from a movie wanting to know more about the world, I give kudos to the writers. Underworld did this for me.<br /><br />A side note: some compare this to the Matrix? Other than a few minor fight scenes where the action flipping is similiar, this comparison is unfounded and unfair to both films. Underworld never comes off as trying to be Matrix-y. It is a modern action trend to have Matrix-like fighting scenes, but a good thing about Underworld is that they did not turn every fight scene into a fight scene from the Matrix. The use of modern fight cliches was limited.<br /><br />Underworld is worth seeing, and those who love it and get it will really love it. Those who want cliches or the Matrix part 4 will hate it.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 65<br /><br />27 (out of 50). Enjoyment.

The biggest action scene is at the very beginning, and then we've gotta whole lot of plot for a very long time.  The action scenes are, of course, your standard John Woo knockoff, particularly this opening one.  This isn't really a criticism on my part-- If you're gonna knock of a particular action director, Woo is the way to go.  It's also hurt by the fact that the opening action scene is by far the best one in the film.  Ya gotta pace yourself, Underworld!  Still, their just isn't enough killing.  The story elements are amusing in their way, but the balance is way off.<br /><br />Almost equally important, 'Underworld' could really use a sense of humor.  This movie is so silly and yet it takes itself completely seriously which makes it all the more ridiculous.  If it had a bit of intentional, perhaps self-parodic humor I think I could take the whole thing quite a bit more straight-facedly.<br /><br />The best thing about `Underwold' is the way it looks.  The thing only cost like 23 million, and it looks completely gorgeous and totally creates the alternate, neo-gothic world that is 'Underworld'.  This film is a classic indictment of the excessive use of CGI in Hollywood, particularly for sets-- Not only does this film cost a fraction of what something like 'Revenge of the Sith' costs, it also looks WAY better.  It actually looks *real*, cause it mostly is.  It has some CGI stuff, but it holds well to my personal rule that you should always use practical, real world effects when they can do the job.  The werewolves themselves don't look so hot, but they're the only really disappointment, and the whole thing is really quite stunning considering the cost.  It's an intensely blue colored affair, but it fits the film and feels appropriate, so that's fine.  Another minor visual concern is that the film fails to differentiate between the visual nature of the vampires and the werewolves sufficiently.  More specifically, the human form werewolves lack any real particular style; they just kinda wear ratty old coats, for the most part.  The vampires are, of course, your Blade/Matrix style black leather neo-gothic night club vampires, the variant which has become utterly dominant in modern vampire cinema.  It disturbs me to think that there are probably a lot of people my age and younger who just think that this is the way vampires are, period.  Not that I particularly care for classically styled vampires or anything, I just fear they lack any perspective.  Anyway...<br /><br />Performances tend to be wildly over the top, as is de rigeur for modern vampire films.  Bill Nighy is especially fun as the head vampire.  Everyone is pretty hammy, but he really takes it to another level.  Kate Beckinsale is fairly bland, formless protagonist, but, on the other hand, she does spend most of the film in a leather body suit. (This fact which I believe has been mentioned in every review of 'Underworld' yet written, so far be it for me to break tradition.)  I should note that the music is generally overwrought and often irritating.  They used that glass harp or maybe just distant, squealing string sound like a trillion times here and it really gets on my nerves.<br /><br />I found the plot to be vaguely incomprehensible for most of the film, but it all came together eventually, so perhaps this was intentional.  Frankly, I wasn't terribly concerned with the plot.  This is a film you mostly just stare at, impressed half the time, snickering the other half.  The former impression is superior, obviously, but they both work, so it's not a total loss.<br /><br />Grade: C+</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>A semi-stylish, only-okay action/monster movie with a muddled plot about werewolves-vs.-vampires and stuff.  It's okay, though: the film moves fairly fast, and Kate Beckinsale looks great in all those tight leather/vinyl jumpsuits.  It's no &quot;Buffy The Vampire Slayer,&quot; but it was okay for a no-brainer rental.  It was lame, though, that so much of the action was just people -- um, I mean, monsters -- standing around shooting a bunch of automatic rifles and pistols... We already see plenty of that in all the non-monster movies; didn't need it here so much.</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>Hey, this is eye candy, pure dark fiction. If I expected deep drama, I would have rented Hamlet instead of seeing Underworld. A few reviewers were dissing it so far, but I happened to enjoy it.<br />It was dark, rainy, fast paced, interesting story line that really makes you want to get to the core of it, thight leather clothes, flying, shooting, running, picturesque fighting sequences.<br />I'm glad i saw it, dont let them tell you otherwise.<br />Also the lycans (werewolves) looked really cool, big raw cats, and the transformatin you got to watch was really some oscar worty special effects.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>Underworld is a great movie.

I can't wait to watch the second movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AHBNPMHDWZ7SB.html">AHBNPMHDWZ7SB</a><br/><p>I don't know about you guys, but I love the Underworld series. This series, along with Blade is what made me a fan of vampires films. Before then, I wrote them off because most of them are love stories. What I failed to realize it that they should be love stories, and I had a misconception of what vampires were all about. Abraham ("Bram") Stroker's original Dracula novel from 1897 was a love story through and through. Even Underworld is a love story at heart. The same argument could be made for Blade, since his love for his mother, and hatred for the monsters that stole her from him is what drove his quest for vengeance. Underworld is more like a Gothic Romeo and Juliet. The difference, and it's a big one, is that the second sexiest actress in the world stars as Selene. The first being Scarlett Johansson. And not only is the lead sexy, but the co-stars are two of my favorite British actors. I love Michael Sheen, and Bill Nighy is amazing. If Simon Pegg and Ian McKellen were in this, I don't know what I would do will all of that British awesomeness. Yes, I love the cast, but the action is pretty good in this movie as well. Comparisons to The Matrix have been made countless times. I don't blame anyone for doing so. Over the course of the franchise, Underworld has found its niche, and moved away from such comparisons.<br /><br />The finale  in the first Underworld is quite well done, in my opinion. I do happen to love werewolves as well. They are only my favorite movie monsters in cinema history. In fact, I just recently watched An American Werewolf In London because I did not feel right calling myself a fan of the beast, not having seen "The Best Werewolf Movie Of All-Time". That said, I don't think they were at their best in this one. They moved too slow to me. I appreciate prostetics over CGI, but make it more believable at least. There is no way a real werewolf would walk straight at someone that slowly if they were shooting at, or whipping it. I can't hold that against the film too much though, because that's only of sign of Underworld's lower budget, especially compared to its sequels. Van Helsing, while it isn't the best film, has some of my personal favorite werewolves. That said, I still enjoyed the R&J-esque story, and how it combined the already connected lores.<br /><br />The story is aided wonderfully by the dark tone and visuals. The gothic look was used perfectly. The vampires' home was a particularly well done set piece. As was the final set where the last fight took place. Speaking of that particular fight, I think it was a tad too short, but the choreography was nicely paced. It allowed you to see every detail, but it didn't move too slowly. I can say that for the entire film actually. The pacing is great, and the lack of quick-cuts allow to to become immersed in the Underworld universe. As a fan of the entire series, I may be biased. I can admit that I see the films' flaws, but still find much more to love in them. I don't blame anyone for not liking these movies, but I don't get the hate. I think it's a lot better than the reception it has received, and certainly worth a watch for anyone who likes vampires or werewolves. Also, you see how easy it is to write a review for vampire/werewolf love stories without bashing Twilight? Yes, it's very easy indeed. I think Twilight is just a female's version of this story. Even though the lead is a female, it is still a movie, or series that caters to a large male audience. And there isn't much that needs to be said for the picture and audio quality of the Blu-rays. Each film in the series is pretty much reference quality. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI.html">A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI</a><br/><p>I could not wait to get in to the theater to see this film, as I'm a huge horror fan, but more specifically, a huge Werewolf fan & running a close second, Vampires. So a movie pitting the two against each other was just to much for me to resist! Was I disappointed?<br /><br />Hell, no!<br /><br />Despite all the bad rap this movie got as a horror clone to "The Matrix," fighting sequences, guns, the Vampire's black dress, especially, Selene's, this movie is it's own film. Filled with action, great effects, good story line, & fast paced, "Underworld" put a stake right through my heart! Especially good was Michael Sheen's character, "Lucian," feral, but sophisticated, he stole the show as the leader of the Lycans. Also particularly good was Bill Nighy's, "Viktor," one of the three leaders of the Vampire clan. His character was at once commanding, intelligent, & sublimely evil, all that you could want from a Vampire!<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale's main character, "Selene," was very well done in portraying hard determination of hunting Lycan's without mercy, digging out Kraven's plans to take over the Vampire clan using Lycans, but also an undeniable vulnerability toward Scott Speedman's other main character, "Michael Corvin." Michael Corvin was descended from the original immortal, Alexander Corvinus, who the Lycans feel will end the long war between them & the Vampires, by combing the cells of the two species into a super hybrid.<br /><br />Also in this Blu-ray version there is about an extra five minutes of footage that really helps flesh things out.<br /><br />I do have some complaints though. Scott Speedman's, "Michael Corvin" character was the weakest link in the chain acting wise, but I suppose in retrospect this was intended, for he had not a clue what was happing to him. Shane Brolly's character, "Kraven" was shrill & shallow, one wonders how he could orchestrate a coup over the Vampire clan, but also in retrospect, his character seems to fit in with the movie the more times it's viewed. I was disappointed in the lack of tooth & fang Vampire, Lycan confrontation, opting instead for guns & technology, but then again, retrospect wise, we don't fight our wars with sticks & stones anymore, so why should the Vampires & Lycans? One more thing, where are the female Lycans? Not nary a one to be seen in this film? With all this hairy tooth & fang machismo "Rin Tin Tin" going on, I think these male werewolves would enjoy a little soft furry support from a hot Lassie???<br /><br />All in all though, this movie satisfies the horror fan in me, there is some flaws, but only enough for me to fault this movie very little. If you want hot Vampire vs. Werewolf action, this is the place to start!<br /><br />4 stars out of 5 = Classic</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Six years before "Underworld: Rise of the Lycans" fully revealed the origins of a war between vampires and lycans, we were flung head-long into the fray with 2003's surprise hit "Underworld".<br /><br />"Underworld" follows Selene (Kate Beckinsale), a vampire who is a member of an elite group of lycan hunters known as "Death Dealers". As the centuries-old blood feud between the two races rages on, Selene and her fellow vampires believe that the lycans' days are numbered. However, when an unsuspecting human (Scott Speedman) becomes the focal point of the conflict; everything Selene believes about the war, her heritage, and her mission may change forever.<br /><br />Upon its release "Underworld" presented audiences with a new take on vampires and lycans (typically known as werewolves). Long gone are the days of Bela Lugosi's undeniably iconic "Dracula" or Lon Chaney, Jr's "The Wolf Man". Now, we are presented with vampires decked out in sleek, leather outfits, packing modern-day weaponry and martial arts influenced fighting styles. Plus, lycans that have never looked as menacing or believable as they do in this film.<br /><br />Not to mention, the lycans' transformations (a nearly seamless blend of CGI and practical effects) are some of the best committed to film to this day. One thing is for sure, these are supernatural beings and monsters for the new, post-"Matrix" generation of moviegoers.<br /><br />Written by Danny McBride ("Underworld: Rise of the Lycan") the film wastes little time jumping into both the main crux of the story (i.e. the specifics of the two races, the war, and so on) and the fast-paced, hard-hitting action sequences. For the most part the story does a terrific job in balancing the plot with the action, interspersed with brief tidbits of the history between the two races. However, at times the plot feels a little too rushed in order to keep the momentum going, resulting in some uneven, almost jumbled aspects to the story.<br /><br />That being said, in the end those moments are overshadowed by the fact that Danny McBride did an excellent job of crafting a story that introduced us to a complicated war between supernatural beings. While the director, Len Wiseman ("Live Free or Die Hard") skillfully guided the story to cinematic life complete with style, an eerie atmosphere that blended the familiar with the supernatural, and a terrifically cast group of actors and actresses.<br /><br />Speaking of the cast, let's begin with actress Kate Beckinsale ("Pearl Harbor") as the leather-clad vampire Selene. Kate's performance was generally stoic and emotionless, which makes sense given she is portraying a member of the so-called undead. However, there were some brief glimpses of newfound emotions boiling to the surface and Kate's handling of Selene's bewilderment to the aforementioned was completely natural and effortless.<br /><br />Also, seeing a female vampire doing a majority of the action was an interesting change of pace for this type of film, but a welcome one at that. Kate handled herself in the action sequences in such a strong, confident manner that she quickly solidified her character as one not to be messed with.<br /><br />Actor Scott Speedman ("Dark Blue") was good in the role of Michael, the human that the lycans are focused upon. However, I did find that occasionally his acting felt a little forced. Perhaps he was over-rehearsed so that the scenes couldn't flow naturally for him. Even so, acting wise I don't believe he is up to par with some of the other, more accomplished cast members.<br /><br />Of course, the fact that a vampire/werewolf movie actually has acting that was good enough to set standards for the entire cast is surprising in itself (at least in my estimation). That alone should indicate that this film is not just another one of your typical, run-of-the-mill monster films where the acting is the last thing on anyone's mind. This film's cast actually seemed to take pride in getting their characters right and making them interesting to the audience, while still holding true to the archetypes being portrayed.<br /><br />Speaking of those cast members that set the aforementioned acting bar; aside from Kate Beckinsale, we have the two talented actors chosen to play the respective leaders of the two races, actors Bill Nighy and Michael Sheen.<br /><br />As the vampire king, Viktor, veteran actor Bill Nighy ("Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest") commands both respect and fear with his portrayal that was at times endearing, but could then be utterly cold, calculating and undeniably evil. His layered performance elevated the character of Viktor from being just another one-dimensional despot to a complicated being that was very real despite his supernatural disposition.<br /><br />The ever-reliable actor Michael Sheen ("Frost/Nixon") as Lucian, leader of the lycans, brought a quiet strength to the role that belied the ferocity lurking just beneath the surface. His performance was laced with such subtle malevolence, so that whenever his character would snap and unleash the inner beast it was almost startling; despite the fact you knew it had to happen at some point.<br /><br />With such generally strong performances, fast-paced action and stunts, and solid storytelling, "Underworld" is without a doubt an excellent monster movie in every sense. The film successfully brings a centuries-old war between supernatural beings to life in a way that is interesting and above all, entertaining.<br /><br />"Underworld" is rated R for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ54MITON1NO.html">ASJ54MITON1NO</a><br/><p>The Underworld film series explores new heights with the vampire film genre, by adding dazzling visual effects and action, done in the style of The Matrix films.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>I loved it!.

I've seen this movie several times and continue to be amazed and the plot and visual look of the movie. Wow. I keep finding new subtle things in the movie overlooked in my first viewing. This movie is the starter for a 3 movie collection. Telling some of the history and moving forward with this story. Underworld and Underworld Evolution move the story further in time while the third movie tells the history of how we got here.<br /><br />The story is about two races of beings, the upper class Vampires and the worker class Werewolves. In the old times, the races lived together in harmony, now they are at war. This story focuses on "a human" who we later learn has characteristics of both races and his blood is valuable to both races. Of course, our lead character (Kate Beckinsale) needs the help of a sleeping vampire lord. A very impressive movie with stunning visual look. Once you finish Underworld, keep on going with Evolution and Rise of the Lycans. Highly recommended and added to my list of favorite movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>This is an interesting film which maintains a fine dark gothic feel, blended with elements of the modern thrown in for good measure as well. They could have just called it "Vampires vs Werewolfs", because essentially this just takes the idea from Aliens vs Predators and transposes it for use with two of the best known gothic horror icons.<br /><br />Where it lets itself down is the lack of character development. Yes it has plenty of action. You certainly won't be dissapointed on that front. After a while though you know when you see a lot of people walking purposefully, that they are going to end up in one hell of a fight with or without guns and it happens over and over. In the end I really didn't what happened to any of the characters...<br /><br />One clear influence is The Matrix. The start of the film is almost a direct copy of a famous scene from that film. Many of the characters walk around in long black leather coats which is also a Matrix influence. That said this does have a considerable amount of style and I will be quite happy to watch this again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EZMV5DSWU8TU.html">A1EZMV5DSWU8TU</a><br/><p>In this thriller, Vampires are at war with the Lycans {werewolves}, who were kept as slaves until in a very Romeo and Julet scenario, Elder Vampire "Viktor" slays his own daughter in front of her werewolf lover who goes on to wage a battle to avenge her death.  Here, The Vampires are aristocratic libertines presiding in opulent lairs while the Lycans are more or less street thugs residing under the city.<br /><br />Subsequently, the Lycans formulate a plan to mix vampire and werewolf DNA to create a master warrior who would destroy the vampires once and for all. Lucian, the leader of the Lycans, sets his sights on a mortal named 'Michael' to be transformed into this champion for them. It is seen that this warrior represents the "son" "Lucian" never had, who himself falls in love with 'Selene', an attractive lycan-hunter, which stirs contention with Kraven, lord of the Vampire castle who stands as vampire ruler, whose reign is less than acceptable to Emperor Viktor, once he is awakened by Selene and becomes aware of the potentially dangerous situation brewing with the Lycans, which can effectively end their existence.<br /><br />Armed with silver nitrate bullets, Selene and a handful of vampires go forth to decimate these werewolves, before they reach them and tear them to pieces. One of the more gorey scenes involves a massacre within a train.<br /><br />Confused by the changes he is experiencing and impelled by his growing fascination with this shadowy underworld as well as an infatuation for Selene, Michael returns to the castle where he was kept prisoner after being kidnapped by Selene, and eventually is captured by Lucian, wherein his resident geneticist "Singe" begins experimenting to complete the matamorphosis into the Vampire-Werewolf synthesis.<br /><br />Viktor wages elegantly with the furious amalgamated warrior, and in an unexpected twist, Selene goes sword to sword with Viktor, ending with a most interesting strike.<br /><br />The film is repleat with enjoyable dark environments, leather-clad accoutrement, impressive transmogrifications, an original and compelling plot, with constant action-adventure {not horror}, in a general "Buffy"/VanHelsing-like vain, although the premise is superior to those presentations. Feral monsters versus regal creatures, preserving the story within the shadows, devoid of any pretentiously daylighty "heroic" characters, which is appreciated.</p></br><a href="../users/A32B206L2SEXRA.html">A32B206L2SEXRA</a><br/><p>Underworld is the first vampire film that really caught my attention.I was immediatly drawn to the fact that it was a war between the vampires and the werewolves,called Lycans in the film.I loved the roles played by Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman as Selene and Michael.This film is a must-see for all horror film fanatics.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Why can't they all just get along? The Vampires and Werewolves "at each others necks" for so many generations instead of letting bygones be bygones, teaming up and feeding on us mere mortals...I mean...how silly.<br /><br />Well I guess it's a good thing for us though, no? And without the war there would have been no action-packed thriller about this war called Underworld.<br /><br />The effects are great in this flick. There's suspense. The DVD comes in a brilliant HD transfer with terrific 5.1 sound. What more could one ask for? How about a sequel/prequel?...Due out about a week from this writing....Hence, my decision to do this belated review.<br /><br />This DVD documents a war that has been raging between the Vampires and Lycans for years all because one of the Vampire leaders didn't want his Vampire daughter marrying a Wolfman several centuries back. Flash back to the present and Kate Beckinsale is a death dealer/Vampire that hunts the last of the Lycan. Scott Speedman is a mortal (for now) that holds the key to end the war, and he takes some licks (and a couple bites...key words: a couple) protecting that key.<br /><br />All in all a very well done story that will likely spawn many more modern day Vampire versus Werewolf movies to come...like Van Helsing, and, oh, the sequel!...Underworld: Evolution!<br /><br />The sequel holds much promise actually. All of the key characters are back played by the same actors...with the same director. That's the first ingredient to a successful sequel (looks like kind of a prequel too).<br /><br />Underworld: Evolution apparently continues the story of the war between the Death Dealing Vampires and The Howling, and also traces the beginnings of the fight between the two mythical, legendary monsters. But that'll have to be another review entirely.<br /><br />So if you've not already, get Underworld into your collection, or at least view it before seeing the next installment. It's definitely a keeper for those into the genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L.html">A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L</a><br/><p>One, I enjoyed the movie.  Gun battles, great special effects, and the lovely Kate Beckinsale.  I liked how the movie makers tried to keep humans in all the scenes and didn't use computer graphics for everything.  Being a fan of Whitewolf I enjoyed parts of the movie and can understand why they sued Sony.<br />But I think they failed in some parts - I would have liked to see vampires fighting fang and claw against the weres a couple of times.  Also, Kate's beauty was under used - she only wore two outfits during the whole movie.  While Sophia Myles, who was Erika, got to show off her beauty with multi-outfits and even got to show off her pretty fangs while on a ceiling.<br />We never learned much about the history of either sides, only in where it was needed to support the plot.  Frankly, while I like Goth, and found many of the backgrounds interesting, I think some vampires would be more colorful.  You're dead - you might as well enjoy it.  What about body art, nose rings and clown outfits?  And why are weres always in sewers or run-down ruins?  They seem to live just as long - don't they have bank accounts?<br />The commentary was perfect and the extras were great, but I fear the movie missed the true greatness it could have reached.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>Other than a loud and annoying soundtrack, I truely enjoy this film.  I thought the story managed a unique twist on an old theme.  Sure there are shots that look as though it belonged in the Matrix but all in all it works. I'm not saying that there aren't a few plot holes or that the movie isn't riddled with coincidences--it is.  I mean the finally fight between Victor and Michael was as anticlimatic as one could get.  We finally get this vampire/werewolf hybrid and Victor kicks his butt.  Selene turns out to be all anyone needs.  But hey, all the fighting poses were sleek and elegant.  More like dancing than fighting.  If you enjoy vampire stories--this film should still make your must see list.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>The film brings to the screen the story of a centuries old blood feud between vampires and werewolves (Lycans).  Things get more complicated when a human doctor is caught up in the conflict, as he becomes the means for creating a vampire-werewolf hybrid, something that could tip the balance between the combatants.<br /><br />Underworld is a highly entertaining, action packed adventure/thriller with significant elements of horror.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale (who is GORGEOUS!!!), Bill Nighy, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!<br /><br />The plot, the setting, the special effects, the MUSIC, and the swordfights are all EXCELLENT!  Underworld is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!<br /><br />In conclusion, the film establishes a GREAT cliffhanger for a sequel, which I would definitely line up to watch!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>"Underworld" is fun to watch, but it's really nothing more than an average sci-fi/action flick.  One thing is for sure, this movie is in no way a horror film.  Take any standard action yarn, replace the good guys with vampires and the bad guys with werewolves.  Next, throw in a twist that bonds one of the goodies and baddies together.  Finally, blend in a betrayal and a cover-up and you basically have the storyline.  There's nothing new here.<br /><br />The two supernatural enemies really don't even use their powers against each other that much.  The "death dealer" vampires have more guns than a cult in Waco.  They don't even get close to ripping open the necks of their enemies. The werewolves, for the most part, are happy reliving scenes from "Fight Club" in the city's subway tunnels.<br /><br />Don't think that this flick isn't enjoyable, though.  It is visually fun to watch and the action is pretty good.  I just wish that the vamps and wolves could have used their powers a little more than their guns.  The betrayal and cover-up mentioned earlier does actually make you pull for one side of the conflict a little more than the other, but in the end, you just want to see these folks beat the heck out of each other until someone yells, "Uncle!"<br /><br />If you want real vampire or werewolf action, check out a movie like "Interview With The Vampire"(better yet, read the book), or "Silver Bullet"(again, the book is better).  If you just want a little brainless action, "Underworld" will suffice.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ATTCCO32ZXET.html">A3ATTCCO32ZXET</a><br/><p>...I learned from Underworld.<br />It has been a most educational experience, watching Underworld.  Until now I was walking around with some very laughable ideas about the Creatures of the Night that we all so take for granted as the pedestrian kind of beings that populate folklore.  From here on out I am enlightened; no longer a gullible moviegoer, or naive reader.  I can rely on the sophistication I have gleaned from this movie to move forward with confidence among the Undead.  Underworld set me straight.<p>For example, not just anybody has what it takes to become a vampire.  The first requirement for immortality is a European accent.  In fact, British and French accented vampires seem to be the most prolific, regardless of residence.  It would be considered extremely gauche for, say, a Texan accent to show up at one of the black tie coven soirees even if he sported the hippest Versace lace cravat.  Next, one must be a model.  This means high cheekbones, gauntly thin, and with a nose constantly in the air as one's lips form a slight pout in resting state.  Only the alpha females are allowed to have larger bustlines; this is so that those black leather designer fashions will drape nicely.  But above all, a vampire must have that cultivated air of aloof that can be obtained by constantly imagining an offensive odor.<p>Now werewolves have to be selected from an entirely different lot.  The master werewolf of Underworld must have scoured every biker bar in LA for swarthy males that with the proper ear hair.  Sideburns and a pointy unibrow will gain you extra points for consideration as well.  Blondes need not apply, as the lupine fashion seems to favor the swarthy look.  Fortunately for Americans, there is less discrimination here with regards to accent.  But make no mistake, the world of werewolves is a male dominated culture - women are for snacking only.  <p>If your taste runs to the slaying side of things you should know that wooden stakes are pass&eacute;.  Please.  Nowadays you will need automatic weaponry and explosive munitions.  Also, be aware that vampires and werewolves alike must have kept up on action flicks because now they have advanced martial art skills upon conversion and can unload seven clips worth of ammo into their foes without reloading.  And did you think vamps were the only ones who could run on walls and ceilings?  It's not just for Eurofrogs anymore.  <p>Some further rules to keep in mind when cavorting with Underworld denizens are:<br />No athletic shoes.  No pastel or white clothing.<br />When in doubt, leather<br />Waterford crystal is the vessel of choice for blood-tasting parties.<br />Bottom line, this is an entertaining action flick that should appeal to those who like movies like Blade.  You can enjoy it if you keep that in mind.<br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle</p></br><a href="../users/A3GQKB1KF0CRPE.html">A3GQKB1KF0CRPE</a><br/><p>Blade was interesting, but to me it failed emotionally.  You just do not connect with the film on the personal level.  The effects were super, but that was the main impact..."wow what amazing effects".  You feel like breaking out in a chorus of Peggy Lee's Is That All There Is.  Special effects alone cannot make a movie great.<p>Underworld makes that jump, great FX work, but also gives you characters you really care about, ones that you really love to hate.  A strong plot line designed to hook you and keep you, just does that.  With the emotional involvement, there is a greater impact, a movie that will demand repeat viewing.  Instant Cult Status.  <p>The movie grabs you from the opening and never lets up with the pace.  Firm direction and with a driving score, the movie reaches for perfection.  You have a 1000-year-old war between Lycons and Vampires, and it's all coming to a head.  It's a well thought out and executed premise and Kate Beckinsale shines!  She is an amazing talent.  I first adored her work in Cold Comfort Farm as Robert Post's child Flora.  When you compare that gentle, deft bit of humor with this kick a*** vampire hunter, it proves what an overlooked talent she is.  With Van Helsing out now (and I am sure this movie led to her landing the role), she is finally getting a spotlight she so well deserves.<p>A gloomy, atmospheric ambiance to the whole movie is maintained all the way through, adding a strong foundation for the otherworld premise.  I am sure some will nitpick things, as all vampire film faces, but kudos for the vibrant energy and sheer edgy feel to the film. <p>It leaves you hanging, clearly open for a sequel...one can but hope it maintains this high quality.<p>Kate rocks...you don't need to know anymore!</p></br><a href="../users/AIBRTGBN07D6A.html">AIBRTGBN07D6A</a><br/><p>I saw the previews for this film and it looked awesome. I couldn't wait to see it, but could never find anyone interested enough to go with me. I finally rented it and was fairly disappointed.<p>The storyline sounds incredible. Werewolves (called "Lycans" in the film to make them sound cooler) vs Vampires? How much cooler can you get? Unfortunately, the coolness factor doesn't expand beyond the concept. Yes, the film does feature Lycans battling Vampires. Unfortunately, the only way you'd know this is by the occasional glimpse of teeth and shot of a full moon. They fight the entire movie with guns. I felt like I was watching a bad splice of The Matrix and Blade. What is the purpose of showing these two historical enemies fighting if they're going to be running behind each other with Uzis? <p>Almost no typical vamp/wolf lore was explored. The ONLY thing the vampires do to show they're vampires if bare their fanged teeth and can jump from big heights. They don't shy away from the sun, turn into bats, suck blood, or anything else which makes vampires cool. The film even refers to them at one point as "bats" yet you never see it. <p>Scott Speedman provides a forgettable performance for all of his 15-20 lines in the movie. The ending is VERY anticlimactic and is just a very watered down gun fight that would have been too boring to make it's way into The Matrix. I had to watch this film over 4 days because I kept falling asleep. What's more, the lycans looked absolutely ridiculous when they changed. The werewolves from "The Howling" 20 years ago had better make up. <p>In regards to the DVD, I had a few problems with it.  The film is very dark, mostly shot at night, in tunnels, or in the rain.  The sound was also poorly reproduced on the DVD.  I was constantly having to change the volume.  I would raise it for speech, and as soon as the action started, the sound would jump and I would have to lower it.  I realize something blowing up should sound louder, but not this loud, and the differences shouldn't be so high where I have to keep my finger on the volume button the whole film.  <p>The extras on the DVD were fairly boring.  Some throwaways like trailers, teasers for other films, and a storyboard comparison, which no one ever cares about.  It also featured a montage of scenes from the movie set to music called "Sights and Sounds."  I don't know what this was or if it was supposed to be entertaining.<p>The featurettes contain a fairly poor "Making Of" special, a commentary with the director, and a special on the visual effects.  <p>Overall, Underworld is a great concept, but the addition of guns and high tech weapons, as well as the idea to turn this into an action film instead of horror, ultimately cause it to fail.  The relationship between Beckinsale and Speedman is never explored beyond a single kiss, even though the film leads you to believe this is another "Romeo and Juliet" story...</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I would certainly advise getting the extended unrated version of this film.  It fills in a little more of the story and helps flesh out the story more.  Filled with tons of extras at a reasonable price makes this worth the purchase.  The movie itself is good and the special effects are top notch.  It falls just a bit short of being a 5 star movie, but the disc itself is 5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>Vampires and werewolves, lycans for short (and it actually only means wolf), have been at war with one another for centuries.  The vampires think they have almost won the war completely.  Things have been going their way ever since they eliminated the lycan leader Lucien.  But a vampire Deathdealer (Kate Beckinsdale) discovers there may be more lycans than they thought and they may be better organized.  To make it worse, the lycans have also managed to get a hold of some nasty weaponry that is deadly to the vampires.  But none of the other vampires seems to believe the threat that Kate knows is out there so she disobeys orders and investigates on her own.<br /><br />She learns that the lycans were following a human for some reason.  Kate tries to figure out why and along the way she develops feelings for the human.  Things really heat up when one of the vampire elders is awakened and has to deal with the changing situations.  Plot and counter-plot abound and we learn more of the history of the two races and their feud.  In the end the whole movie seems more like the first part of a much larger story.  I have not yet seen the sequel so I don't know how well it continues the story.<br /><br />The effects for the movie were pretty good although there are few clear shots of the lycans.  Most of the film almost feels black and white as there is very little color.  There are also many references to the histories and the war and it seems like the numbers get a little confused.  But this is an action-thriller and details like that often suffer so one expects it.  The only real problem I had with the film was the way it felt like it was setting up a larger story.  With the success of the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings movies one can certainly believe that such an attempt could be possible.  We shall see.  One thing I really liked was they way the two societies were portrayed.  While equally intelligent the vampires acted like aristocrats while the werewolves were far more bestial.  Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>Underworld is a film that continues to water down vampires as most of us know them.  This process began with Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, but these stories still retained the horrific true nature of vampires even with a more relatable, human face.  Now we come to this day where between Buffy the Vampire Slayer (which I did enjoy) and Twilight (hate with burning passion) we have films in the middle of this watered down vampire genre that many have grown used to.  There's the good humanized vampires (Anne Rice), the bad (Twilight), and then there's the ones that just fall right dab in the middle and that would be where I'd place Underworld.<br /><br />The movie itself starts off with our heroine Selene doing her best to try and look like The Crow or an extra from The Matrix while she gives us a monologue on how the vampires and werewolves (which for some reason this movie has titled "Lycans").  She explains that she's a "Death Dealer" meaning that she hunts down the remaining Lycans.  Instantly we have her and another guy (we'll guess that in their exchange of head nodding he's also a Death Dealer) jumping down from the top of buildings and landing without harm on the concrete below...how convenient it is that no one saw them.<br /><br />We then somehow get this character of Michael Corvin involved as some...truly boring individual.  So when the vampires discover the Lycans have been following him so they soon send Selene to investigate it.  Selene and Corvin of course end up being together and escape the Lycans.  Does this mean we finally get a Vampire+Human buddy action film?  Of course not!  As awesome as that could have been Corvin has been bitten by a Lycan and monster 101 dictates he shall soon become one.  Now we realize the true plot intent of this movie is to be some strange, leather clad Romeo & Juliet.<br /><br />The rest of the plot...quite frankly bored me to tears.  Nothing in this movie ever paused itself to try and make sense!  They kept twisting subjects around and around, showed weird aspects of vampire society that may seem cool to eyes but they never really got any elaboration other than "here's this cool thing, now let's try for something completely different."  It just wasn't a coherent storyline.<br /><br />Vampirism just isn't shown well in this movie.  Remember the days of Dracula, or even the adaptation of Interview with the Vampire some years back?  That should remind you vampires, and their bite are more sexual than anything else.  In Underworld there is zero sensuality in this act and it pretty much is only shown for the blood.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale is really attractive, but looks just can't save this film.  There is no chemistry between the leads and most of the cast seems bored.  No one really gets my attention in this film because they are all so very bland.  When the plot gets chugging along it has far too many characters to keep track of and when we finally discover the true villain of the film we are greeted to the most anti-climactic final confrontation I have seen in recent cinema.<br /><br />Now I will grant it the film does have some really good sets that obviously had quality work put into them, but that can't save the fact that the plot is a mess and the characters are unremarkable.  The director is essentially trying to knock-off Blade, The Matrix, and The Crow off all while in the same movie and it clearly shows in his awkward style as he tries desperately to replicate techniques that worked well in previous films of the genre.  So if you want a somewhat fun action movie this show is for you, but don't be expecting anything new, or for that matter even anything all that entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Apart from the comic trip look and feel of this film, apart from the special effects both on the side of the vampires and on the side of the werewolves, apart from the impossible love affair between a vampire girl and a werewolf boy, at the beginning qt least, soon to become something else, this film is decadent in all possible ways and somewhere kind of paranoid. And yet there is something that floats over the whole thing, that survives the animal horror that animates these pictures and bleak places. Two species have been fighting for centuries and the salvation of both is in a new blood line that will cross the two different ones. Peace can only come from crossing the bloodlines of the two rivals, the two enemies, the two antagons. And that works, in the film of course, because in reality if it were that simple...! It has been noticed that when a civil war starts we never know when it will stop. It took some thirty years for the latest episode of the Irish civil war to come to maybe an end and that was only the last episode of a war that was started by the invasion and conquest of Ireland by the English three or four centuries ago. And I will not speak of the Bosnian or Kosovar conflicts, nor of the opposition between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq and in the world. But that's the optimistic final scene of a film that targets teenagers when war comes to an end because the two bloodlines have been mixed in the veins of a new leader. Yet I found the film a little bit long and repetitive as for the fighting scenes.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</p></br><a href="../users/APW72P4COWTBK.html">APW72P4COWTBK</a><br/><p>I don't care what people say! THIS MOVIE IS ANIME!!!<br /><br />If you saw animes like Battle Angel and Biohunter then you will realize where the "character's look or style", production, dark setting and most of all action scenes and fights came from.<br /><br />Some other animes that inspired this movie are: Escaflowne, Vampire Hunter D, Twilight of the Darkmaster, Blood the Last Vampire and more... but the main ones are Battle angel and Biohunter.<br /><br />Underworld also have a "goth" look and a horror-fantasy story, so NOT EVERYTHING is anime! But is more anime than a great dark action-packed movie since The Crow.<br /><br />Another american anime tributes are:<br /><br />* Kill Bill vol. 1<br /><br />* Guyver 2<br /><br />* Martix collection<br /><br />* Blade (some anime looks but not THAT much)<br /><br />* Treasure Planet (some anime looks but not much)<br /><br />* Atlantis (some anime looks but not much)<br /><br />* Power Rangers (worst tribute ever)<br /><br />Adios.</p></br><a href="../users/A15MLF38WROSWU.html">A15MLF38WROSWU</a><br/><p>This film is full of action, and I like it when a movie is full of action.  This is not your typical vampire versus werewolves movie.  This movie has a lot of the action.  So if you are expecting a horror or science fiction film, then you may be disappointed.  If you enjoy a good action movie, with some awesome special effects, then this is the movie for you.<br /><br />Selene is a beautiful vampire who has a major dislike for the Lycans (the werewolves).  She spends a great deal of time tracking and killing them.  Selene hatred of the Lycans stems from the fact they are responsible for killing her family, or so she thinks.  After an intense gun battle, Selene is trying to figure out why the Lycans are after a human named Michael.  The werewolves it turns out, have discovered a way to turn the war in their favor, by finding a human named Michael Corbin ( Scott Speadman). Michael has the genes necessary to survive a bite from both a werewolf and a vampire, which would help to create a species that would be deadly to the vampires.  She tracks this Micheal, but not before he is bitten by a Lycon.  Now he will become a Lycon, but Selene is drawn to him, and feels she must help Michael.<br /><br />What I enjoyed about this movie is the use of the advanced technology used to during the fights.  They use high tech firearms, computers, and fancy cars.  The vampires even come up with a special bullet to kill the Lycans.  Kate Beckinsale is GREAT as Selene.  Even though he was a bad guy I was loving Raze.  What can I say?  I have a weakness for handsome black men with bald heads, and deep voices.<br /><br />One of my favorite scenes is of Selene jumping off the building.  The way she jumps, lands, and then starts to walk without missing a step is just phenomenal!!!  I watch that scene about a 100 times because it's so amazing to me.  I enjoyed the movies plot twist, the dark themes, the action, this is a very stylish film.  The werewolves transforming and the way they run along the walls talk about WOW!!!  This is another movie where you find yourself actually rooting for the vampire instead of hating them.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie, and the ending certainly left room for a sequel.  Every time I watch this movie, I discover something I missed during prior viewings.  After watching the film, you have to watch the extras.  Normally I don't pay too much attention to the extras, but for this movie I had to see Featurettes.  The Making of Underworld, Creature effects, stunts, and Sights and Sounds.<br /><br />This is a movie you must have as part of your DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C27IQUH9N1Z.html">A2C27IQUH9N1Z</a><br/><p>This film had a great trailer, and I've enjoyed Kate Beckinsale in other films, so I thought I'd give this a try.  I was really disappointed.  First, it's difficult to know who to root for: the Lycans are brutish but the vampires are decadent and duplicitous but dress better, both are violent.  The film is gorgeous to look at, but by the end I really didn't care about any of these characters; there are elements from Matrix and Terminator and a dozen other thrillers here, but no one to care about -- sort of like a fantastic-looking Hammer film.<p>Extras include trailers and a tv spot, storyboard comparison and a music video.  the film can be heard in English or French with subtitles in English, French or Spanish.  (We found the subtitles useful since it was often difficult to figure out what characters were saying.)</p></br><a href="../users/A13RM1AWD1C5ZR.html">A13RM1AWD1C5ZR</a><br/><p>Underworld, an action flick starring Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman can be called diverting entertainment.  Though the plot of the film is rather incomprehensible, the film has enough style to be atleast watchable.  Director Len Wisemen who is recently engaged to Beckinsale) creates a nice setting to the film, with the appropriate tone.  The action scenes are pretty good, as well the visual effects which are passingly cool including the transformation of humans into werevolves.<br />  Kate Beckinsale plays Selene, a vampire.  The film takes place in London.  There are mainly two striving groups, the vampires and the lycans a.k.a. werewolves.  Scott Speedman plays a human who has been bitten and has transformed into a lycan.  Unfortunately Beckinsale and Speedman fall in love, which is intolerable since they are sworn enemies.<br />  Underworld is mild for the genre, since it isn't overly graphic, though there still is an abundant amount of violence.  Mainly including much gunplay, impalements, bitings (some of which are bloody), whippings and fights among vampries/lycans.  There isn't much profanity, just a few instances of the "f" and "s" word.  Underworld is rated R for Strong Violence/Gore and Some Language.  As for the acting, well it wasn't totally believe or convincing but then again you don't expect oscar-worthy acting in a film like this.  I saw it in theatres, sadly not during opening weekend.  This film is worth viewing in theatures, and possibly owning on Video or DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Upon watching UNDERWORLD for the first time, I wasn't expecting to be very interested. I had read so many negative reviews and heard so many people say that it was a rip-off of ROMEO AND JULIET, that I just wasn't expecting much. Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised when the final credits started to roll and I was left sitting in my seat thinking, "What? It's over already?".<p>As many have already stated, the film is about a vampire death-slayer (vampires who hunt wearwolves) who falls in love with a human who has been bitten by her most hated enemy, the werewolf overlord who was supposed to have been killed centuries before. The film starts off somewhat slow then rushes into a fighiting frenzy, then slows down, then rushes into a fighting frenzy, then slows down. The entire movie is paced this way. Some find it irritating. However, I felt that it added to the mood of the movie, the pace of the film accompaning the transformations that the characters undergo both physically and psychologically.<p>The lighting and costumes seemed to fit the dark underworld that is the setting for most of the film. The only time the tones lightened up were in flashbacks to centuries before when the wearwolves and vampires weren't at war, suggesting a more pleasant era.<p>The characters in the movie aren't allowed to develop much, except through narrative. However, I didn't find that this took anything away from the movie. Much like all franchises (as UNDERWORLD is sure to become), this film sets up everything that is to come in the next.  This isn't a thinking person's movie nor is it a full blown action piece; in the style and tone the movie has more of a literary feel than anything else. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough conflict between the wearwolves and the vampires; so much time is spent on setting the tone, mood, and narrative that there wasn't much time left for action. Nevertheless, I still found that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and look forward to seeing it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>This movie was made with a sequel in mind, just look at how it ended! But I did enjoy this film, I liked the atmosphere and the characters and the story is pretty interesting (hard to follow?? - no way.) Why such bad reviews? Who knows, maybe the critics are Lycans and the moon was full when they saw the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>"Underworld" has two great things in it; beautiful images and elegant Kate Beckinsale.  Period.  Except for them, you get nothing particularly special about it -- the actions are not new, the acting is not good, and most of all the story is very slow-moving and uninvolving.  <p>"Underworld" is, some say, the Romeo and Juliet story in vimpire/werewolf version.  This account is quite misleading.  It is about Ms Beckinsale's Selene, deadly assassin with guns among the vampire clan.  They are fighting the bloody war so long with the now-outnumbered werewolves (Lycans, they are called), so no one remembers the original cause of the war.  So, Selene is told to kill, and she kills.  So far so good.  <p>And the opening subway gun-shooting scenes are reasonably done.  And Scott Speedman's doctor named Michael enters as the possible target of the Lycans.  Selene only seems aware of the fact that Michael has some secret he doesn't know, but the leader of the Lycans (Michael Sheen) is desperately after.  Now the plot is going to thicken.<p>But it doesn't.  Soon we get confused because of the very clumsy storytelling, i.e. talk, talk, talk, which includes many monologues, intricate relations of characters, and some ritualsa and traditions about the dynasty of old, sleeping vampires.  Some are intrigued by these webs of facts, but I must say ... Isn't this supposed to be Romeo and Juliet?<p>The director Len Wiseman unaccountably doesn't show any interest in the relations between Beckinsale and Speedman.  This misguided choice kills any potential power they might have been given; instead, we start to lose interest in them.  How should we care these uninteresting characters?<p>If you have seen "Blade" "Blade 2" or the first "Crow", don't expect the actions, which lack originality.  Not that they are bad -- far from it.  But the fact remains that we have seen more exciting and unique ones in them, and to make matters worse, for all the inclusion of creature designer Patrick Tatopoulos, the werewolves are not convincing.<p>We got good production designs including the cobbled streets of Budapest; we got credible and often very sinister atomospher.  Still we need more power, or elegance, or humor, or anything here, which might heighten the tension between the two clans.  We need danger, and only in danger Beckinsale's death dealer starts to shine.</p></br><a href="../users/A169I83JL8QJGN.html">A169I83JL8QJGN</a><br/><p>Okay not really, but this movie comes so close to VTM that White Wolf Publishing, Inc sued the filmmakers. The funny thing is that it's the similarities to VTM that are this otherwise shallow and hokie movie's redeeming features. See this film is entertaining, it's not horrible, but it's not great either. It's certainly better than any other vampire movie I've seen of late, which is sad really... It's just disturbing to me that the only thing I really enjoyed about this movie was watching for subtle not-so-unintentional similarities to Vampire the Masquerade.<br /> The irony is that having been a rabid White Wolf addict-fan for the last thirteen years I have had my level of expectations for vampire movies and literature raised so high that even White Wolf themselves can't always meet the expectations because so much of their past work has been beyond excellent. Its difficult for anything to live up so such expectations without ripping off the World of Darkness completely, and while I don't think that was the intention of this film they did come pretty close to doing that, and I really hate to say it, but if they had just ripped off more elements of Vampire the Masquerade and Werewolf the Apocalypse the movie, including the brilliant narrative of the White Wolf writing staff, and we would have had a masterpiece of a vampire movie, up there with Interview with the Vampire. Instead all we have is a few (like 60 according to White Wolf's lawyers) points of similarities mixed in with Romeo and Juliet, minus the tragic ending, and without any real character development, or decent dialogue, plus characters who don't realize that when you're pumped full of silver nitrate you're supposed to be dead, as in no getting up... I think the lesson that needs to be learned from this movie isn't &quot;don't rip of Vampire The Masquerade&quot; it's &quot;For crying out loud you know you want to, just make Vampire: The Masquerade into a movie!&quot; There's more than enough material to go on there, you could even make a 13 volume movie series based off the clan novels, I mean really they're great! Let's stop making these cheesy wanna-be vampire movies and go for the real thing! Come-on Sony! You know you want to! Only be sure to get Justin Achili to write your screenplay.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2.html">A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2</a><br/><p>When I saw the cover of this in the video store, I thought to myself that this was going to be a great vampire movie.  I was very wrong.  This movie was a big disappointment to me.  Half of the movie was no talking and shooting..boring action at that.  The two stars are for Kate Beckinsale and the few gory parts of the movie that I enjoyed.  The extras are even poor on this DVD.  Nothing there except a few trailers and some other boring stuff.  This movie was so boring that I fell asleep every time I tried watching it all the way through.  I FINALLY managed after the fourth time of trying to watch it.  I would not recommend this.  A rental is about all it's good for.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q.html">A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q</a><br/><p>I can't help but think that the mixed reception this film has gotten has more to do with its pretensions than its reality.  It is a very competent, if stagecrafty, vampire film.  It features lots of atmosphere and dramatic, gothic filmogaphy.  It takes place in a setting that is half Prague and half London - underground scenes, castle scenes and even a chase or two.  Stunts and costumes are excellent - the film uses costumes and stunts rather than CGI for it's effects - for a result that is, as someone else remarked, half Dracula and half Matrix.<p>The premise isn't completely original, but is well worked out, making vampires and lycans (werewolves) a kind of medical accident arising in the depth of the plague years developing a complex hierarchical society with vampires at the to and the werewolves at the bottom.  This somehow impacted, and lycans and vampires are at war, with the werewolves at a disadvantage.<p>In the midst of a hunt Selene (Kate Beckensale) finds that a nest of werewolves is determined to capture a human - Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman).  Her investigation puts her at odds with her coven's leader, Kraven (Shane Brolly), and the ensuing events reveal something so menacing that vampire and lycan are threatened.<p>In essence this is a pure action film not a horror film.  There are gestures at romance and the politics of the night but the primary movement is set scene - chase scene - fight scene.  While the acting is generally competent - Beckensale is quite good, and Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy are excellent as lycan and vampire elders - it isn't spectacular.  Certainly not good enough to make what director Ken Wiseman thought might be 'the greatest vampire story ever told.'<p>Seen purely as what it is, 'Underworld' is an enjoyable, fast-paced film that presents in interesting vision of life in the darkness.  Held against an arbitrary standard of greatness or a belief that it is the deconstruction of the vampire mythos, it falls short.  The Dracula remake is still the pinnacle of this genre, and may be for some time to come.  One the other hand I could watch films like this one after another without a single qualm.<p>The extras, feature films on the making of , etc., and several commentaries are excellent, and throw some interesting light on the film and its characters.  If you like foreboding technogothic thrillers this is made for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TOH8S8I1VT9R.html">A1TOH8S8I1VT9R</a><br/><p>This movie is getting alot of critique here at amazon.  Another one of those fringe films everyone has an opinion on.  Some of the supporters are obvious gothic horror film freeks who like anything with wowzer special affects.  Some of the detracters just can't enjoy a film that is'nt "highly acclaimed".<br /><br />  Well, I fall between these two extremes.  Here's my take on this highly watchable "horror/action/gothic/Matrix" wanna-be;<br /><br />-Obviously "The Matrix" series (and it's financial success) had allot to do with this getting made.  I would call this the horror equivelent to "The Matrix" series.<br /><br />-Now some are crying fowel. But this film gets criticized for the exact thing that "The Matrix" does; THE STORY HAD INFINITE BUT FAILED POTENTIAL.<br /><br />-Actually, I think if "The Matrix" stopped at the first film, it would have been more impressive.  "Underworld" has a less flawed story than the 2 "Matrix" sequals.<br /><br />-Say what you will, the special affects are pretty cool.  This is how this film got most peoples attention in the first place.<br /><br />-Miss Beckinsale is quite fetching in her costume... hey, you can't argue!<br /><br />-The vampires (other than Kate) seemed a little too whimpy.  For the most part, they get trounced.<br /><br />-The stories biggest flaw: Using guns to do most of the fighting.  These are supernatural creatures,  LET THEM DUKE IT OUT!!<br /><br />-I did not know that vampires could act in a consious manner with their brains detached from their bodies.  Just nit-picky I guess.<br /><br />-I really enjoyed this film on a visual level.  They obviously were going for allot of "posed" imagry.<br /><br />-Most reviewers are correct when they say you don't care much for either side.  HOW COULD YOU!!  THEY ARE, BY DEFINITION, SCARY MONSTERS THAT EAT US!!<br /><br />-The DVD is adequate for the "not-the-directors-unrated-cut-super-special-edition".  For what I paid (NOT $15) I'm happy.<br /><br />The bottom line:  I actually was very afraid to buy this based on the mixed reviews.  So, I waited for a really good sale.  I'm happy with my purchase.  Not a great film but entertaining.  It will be fun to watch around Halloween.  Given the premise, most people with a fair imagination could have come up with much more dynamic and quality alternative story-line.  But I am much less disturbed by this than the "matrix" sequals (which I also enjoyed quite a bit).  If you can't get over that part of it, then I would'nt recommend it.  Borrow or rent first.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>Move over, Blade:  there's a new girl in town.  Kate Beckinsdale plays a vampire assassin who kills werewolves in an ongoing, ages-old feud between the two groups of nightime dwellers.  Although she is a member of a clan, she doesn't really feels she fits in, and spurns the affections of the young and handsome  next would-be leader of her clan.  The only one she has complete respect and adoration for is her ancient sire.  Things start to change when she finds out more about the true reason the two groups are fighting, and falls in love with a human caught in the crossfire.  This relationship lends a Romeo & Juliet aspect to the film.<p>Set in a modern Romanian city,  Underworld is an orgy of extremely violent action between the decadent vampires and the Spartan werewolves.  Supercool, with great acting, gorgeous sets, and KB in a skintight leather suit with kool boots, Underworld is a classic that I am proud to own.</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>This actually a great movie and it doesen't shy away from the gore and blood like i thought from the trailer.  But this is an origional great movie, im looking forward to the sequal!</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>Vampires fighting werewolves, and Kate Beckinsale in leather, are the twin promises of "Underworld", and you'll probably be happy if your expectations are no higher than that.  To be fair, the lavish digital imagery suggested by the trailer is deployed with impressive restraint, and the film is distinguished from most other effects-intensive offerings by its determination to tell a story.  The problem is that the story it chooses to tell is convoluted, unmotivated and, in the end, not a particularly thrilling one.  What starts as a promising detective-tale-with-love-interest collapses under the weight of its own backstory and the apparent need to lay the ground work for a sequel. A tale of night-stalking monsters, blood disorders and forbidden love is surely ripe for a psycho-sexual subtext, but Danny McBride's screenplay seems content to make a few passing references to black slavery and leave it at that.  He was clearly more concerned with writing chase sequences involving a variety of expensive vehicles and cramming in enough "acting" roles for all his old stuntman buddies.  As director, Len Wiseman's adman pedigree is far too obvious.  He delivers one or two interesting shots, but generally relies on an aesthetic owing too much to rock videos, computer games and "The Matrix" ever to be truly engaging in its own right.  Still, the whole package shows enough promise to keep me interested in what these guys do next.  On a budget of $23 million, they've delivered a lot of movie for the money.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N8K1X0OLLADY.html">A1N8K1X0OLLADY</a><br/><p>I thought this would be as good as the Blade movies, but it definitly is NOT.

I really like the Blade movies and the plot seemed realy cool. I was expecting a unique and god story and some awesome action and special effects. Well....<br /><br />The movie is about an ongoing battle between vampires and their arch enemies, werewolves. But, crossed between this fight is a vampire that falls for a werewolve. The movie has a neat and cool opening fight and then... Well, the movie's plot started to bore me and there was too much talking. It was a pretty boring movie and I found myself dozing off at times. Also, Kate Beckinsale fires her uzi guns like 5000000000000 times before finally reloading. How many bullets does it hold? And also, she seems to fire a lot but hits mostly the walls. Also, the fights weren't very exhilirating. And it would have been really cool if the vampires would have like jumped off walls to dodge the werewolves but no.. The final scene is fun and cool but I had to wait through a lot of boring stuff and just useless scenes. And the fights weren't cool like Blade's, they were just a little dissapointing.<br /><br />But, it's an ok rent with some good special effects, a couple good fights and a good conclusion.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>This film was fairly heavily panned by the critics when it opened in September 2003 and I feel undeservedly so, for it is a highly watchable, if uninventive piece of cinema.<br />Kate Beckinsale plays a Vampire whose job is to hunt and kill Lychens (Werewolves) the sworn enemy of her coven, and her kind. The film has a distinctly European feel, not only in the locations, but also direction but moves at a good pace, keeping the viewer awake and for the most part enthralled. A little heavy on the Matrix style fight sequences, with the usual ammunition flying in all directions, it is however, more than a reworked vampire tale of good vs evil, or eveil vs evil (whichever you take) - with a reasonably original storyline in what one has to say, is a highly competetive, and previously visited genre. Without giving too much away, the art direction is gothic but modern and the new Sfx meets old world macabre well, even if there aren't too many suprises along the way. A major plus is the non cliched and well defined beginning middle and end, and the very well handled &quot;human touch&quot; portrayed by the main characters in their fantasy roles. Highly enjoyable romp, with some nice extra's on the DVD, and certainly worth a second look.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>"But, soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.  Rise up, beautiful sun, and make the jealous moon invisible."<p>One of the most popular of Shakespeare's plays, Romeo and Juliet, has been transformed into many different feature films; some good (the 1968 version) and some bad (the 1996 version starring Leonardo DiCaprio). But the main point is that this enduring tale of two star-crossed lovers (which, in reality, Shakespeare ripped off) has been able to stand the test of time, be passed on to future generations and has been embraced as much as it has ever been. Now a more different (really different) version has emerged with werewolves and vampires taking the place of the feuding families the Montagues and the Capulets. But Screen Gem's gothic take on the famous tale is much more loosely based then previous versions. How loosely based? At press time there was already talk of a sequel. William Shakespeare must be rolling in his grave right now.<p>Underworld is loosely based on Romeo and Juliet with werewolves and vampires, two feuding clans, battling for supremacy. Selene, a vampire, is a "Death Dealer", an armed assassin who hunts down the Lycans, also known as werewolves. For centuries the war between the vampires and the Lycans has been raging on outside of the knowledge of the human race but that may all change with new rumblings in the underworld. Selene soon becomes infatuated with a human named Michael, who becomes the focus of a secret plot by the Lycans to resurrect their dying species. Why is this such a big deal? The integration of these two rivaling species is strictly forbidden but such an event could end the war. Why would anyone not want this? Selene believes that there are secrets within both clans that push the classic theme of appearance vs. reality. The story of Underworld is intriguing to say the least but gets too caught up in itself to make truly any sense. There are many surprising twists and turns in the plot but so many that the feature becomes bogged down and just plain confusing by the end of its two hour run. And talk about being "loosely" based! The filmmakers claim that Underworld is based on Romeo and Juliet with two members of feuding clans coming together in blissful love but outside of that, the similarities end pretty quickly. And even that similarity isn't well based with any romantic interests between the two main characters being pretty flat and disconnected.<p>The cast is full of wonderful actors and actresses but few famous faces to bring in even a built in audience. Kate Beckinsale, who saw her star power rise dramatically after her role in the 2001 hit Pearl Harbor, is obviously the main focus of the feature and does a wonderful job with her time in the spotlight or lack of light. Beckinsale gives an uber-sexy performance as Selene that may give another leather clad actress, Carrie-Ann Moss, a run for her money in that area. The only problem with her character is that little detail is given to her character's past and even when those details are available, they aren't explored in flashback sequences, which would have relieved some confusion in the plot. Scott Speedman, best known for performance on the late Felicity series on the WB television network, does a best a performance as he can give but as important as his character is to the plot of the film, he really isn't given anything to show off his true acting chops. Bill Nighy, who plays the ancient vampire leader Viktor, gives an entertaining performance that was still quite interesting despite the fact that he doesn't appear till relatively late in the film. The only upsetting fact of the character is the way he dies, which seemed like a slap in the face to the fine performer who worked so hard to set up an engaging character only to be kicked down so quickly.<p>Overall, Underworld is an insult to the famous play on which it is based, no matter how loosely it is. Poor William Shakespeare must be rolling in his grave! The idea seemed to an interesting one, so what went wrong? A lot of things. Despite having a decent two hour time length, Underworld becomes too bloated by the midway point that by the end, it just gives up and rolls downhill. The plot has too many twists and turns to get a clear understanding of what is going on and ends with more questions then answers. How did the vampires and werewolves start out? How were the werewolves able to evolve so that they could change at random? Why is it the werewolves and vampires seem to have this all out war against each other going on for centuries without the knowledge the human race? Some of those answers may be present in the feature but the main focus becomes so confusing that anything else is pushed out of your mind to even ponder. And even though this is a horror/monster film, Screen Gem could have taken the blood factor down a notch or two as there were too many unnecessary squeamish moments for some to take especially after gobbling down a full bucket of popcorn. The action sequences are well done, though the filmmakers seem to borrow too many elements from The Matrix series to make them even slightly original. So despite an excellent performance by Kate Beckinsale and well choreographed action sequences, Underworld comes off as being too long, grim and confusing to recommend above superior fall fare like Once Upon a Time in Mexico.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>A skin tight leather clad Kate Beckinsale stars in this derivative mess which tells the story of a thousand year plus war between vampires and werewolves. Beckinsale is a vampire, or a "death-dealer", who hunts werewolves down. One night she discovers a group of them chasing a seemingly normal young man (Scott Speedman), followed by a plethora of derivative action scenes, campy over-acting, and one too many loose ends and plot holes. On the outside, Underworld is a stylish thriller that boasts a very attractive female lead, although Beckinsale's true acting talents aren't entirely put to use. Speedman is wasted as the hapless sap who just happens to be the right guy at the wrong time. The special effects (especially the werewolf transformations) are phenominal; these effects have come a long way since The Howling. Other than that though, Underworld is just a mess. The action scenes seem to be derivative hybrids of The Matrix, Blade, Resident Evil, The Crow, and a mess of other action/sci-fi/horror films. Plus, by the time the credits start rolling, we are left with one too many loose ends and questions, plus an ending epilogue that automatically opens the door for an inevitable sequel. All in all, Underworld had a load of promise, but in the end it is just another derivative thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>There are two kinds of directorial debuts. There are the kinds that instantly establish directors as critically-acclaimed and immensely talented, and then there are movies like &quot;Underworld.&quot; Len Wiseman's vampires vs. werewolves flick had so much promise, and just about all of it is squandered.<p>The vampires and Lycans have been at war for centuries, for reasons that are revealed later in the movie. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is one of the vampires whose sole duty and purpose is to hunt down and kill the Lycans (a &quot;death dealer,&quot; har har) with guns that shoot silver bullets. The Lycans, in turn, fire ultraviolet bullets that can kill the vampires. Whatever.<p>Enter Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), a young human who is being followed by the Lycans. Selene is intrigued by why he's important to the Lycans, but unfortunately he's been bitten by one, and is now in danger of becoming one. To uncover the answers about why Corvin is important, Selene will uncover the truth about both the Lycan and vampire races -- and secrets about her own past.<p>There hasn't been a halfway decent vampire flick in uncounted years, or a decent werewolf flick in even longer. Looks like that  Taking &quot;Underworld&quot; even semi-seriously is hard to do; it's like the unwanted illegitimate child of &quot;Matrix&quot; and &quot;Blade,&quot; without the appeal of either. The special effects are okay, but the story and action (not to mention the near-nonexistant romance) are as cold and clammy as a vampire's kiss.<p>Wiseman's clumsiness is shown vividly in the action scenes, which are all cloned from &quot;Matrix&quot; -- lots of bullets, swirling leather and antigravity jumps. And some humor might have elevated this film to action camp, but heroes and villains alike are so earnest that they almost come across as goofy. There are plenty of gaping plot holes that could have been avoided (why do vampires spend all their time lounging around?), but Wiseman apparently doesn't bother to try spackling them shut.<p>Kate Beckinsale, a talented young actress, is horribly wasted here. Most of her time is spent pouting and wearing how-can-she-move leather. Her chemistry with Speedman is nil, which is good, since the romance between them is also virtually nonexistant. Speedman does what he can, but he doesn't have much to work with. Bill Nighy alone gets to chew the scenery as senior vamp Viktor.<p>Relentlessly hokey and humorless, &quot;Underworld&quot; is an effort to elevate style over substance. In the end, it doesn't have either. Watch it with some friends to mock it, but otherwise don't bother.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>This is a film that certainly should stand as an example of &quot;style over substance.&quot;  All the actors (except Scott Speedman)run around obviously feeling very cool and stylish in their dark costumes, but they forget to invest any real feeling into their performances.<p>But that isn't entirely their fault.  The idea of a whole separate &quot;underworld&quot; co-existing with ours, wherein vampires and lycans battle each other is pretty neat, but it's hard to imagine a movie doing LESS with the concept.  And Kate Beckinsale (a vampire and lycan-hunter extraordinare) and Scott Speedman (bitten by a lycan) are sort-of Romeo and Juliet types, except the actors and the script forgets to inject any actual heat (or hint of believability) into their &quot;romance.&quot;  We gather that for some reason Beckinsale cares for the milquetoast, slightly seedy looking Speedman, but can't begin to imagine WHY!<p>Beckinsale looks good in her costume.  She's got a lean body and the right features for the role. But she's really pretty light-weight...and I'm concered that she's becoming a movie action figure, what with a lead role in VAN HELSING (where the previews make it clear she's got a terrible accent!).  I've liked her in many things (LAUREL CANYON, for example) but this project lets her down...and she let's it down too.  Although it's unlikely she could carry it.<p>The film gets two stars (rather than one) for the costumes and for the great special effects when an ancient vampire (played by Bill Nighy) is brought prematurely back to life.  He puts on layers of himself and we get to see the gory transformation.  Someone put a lot of work into that...too bad the others involved in the film didn't try so hard.<p>Can't really recommend this one to anyone, but I don't think there are any materials that a kid over 13 can't see.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OMPSEVL59ZDK.html">A3OMPSEVL59ZDK</a><br/><p>The Trailer was inspired, the posters were eye candy, the concept was brilliant. The only strike against it's add campaign was the horrific title the movie chose as its monicker. So where did this little-movie-that-could go wrong? Lets investigate shall we.<p>Set Design: No problems from this angle. Besides being a bit cliched everything felt right at home.They were dark set pieces that helped set the mood for the battle of the century. Vampires Vs. Werewolves!! "Only in America".<p>Cinematography: Everything is pretty much soaked in this blue-gray color. It has been done many times before. I wish that just one of these movies would just show some color, it's dark, I get it. <p>Writing: Here, ladies and gentlemen, is the first strike. Many of the lines that these poor thespians must speak are, to say the least, atrocious. It was almost comedic how many cliched lines were just spewed forth. And their was no farce to support these lines, they are spoken with the most serious of tones it becomes almost like a running gag. Unfortunately this is not a comedy and the audience never "gets" the joke. Terrible job. <p>Acting: Strike two! You must care for all of these characters for one reason and for one reason alone: they look really cool in black. Kate runs around emotionless and dull, motivated but strangely lifeless. The rest of this cast just follows the acting 101 lesson of basic emotions. "Grrr I'm angry." "Sniffle I'm sad." They breathe no life into any part of this sad sad production. Not one vampire ever acts like a vampire. Not one werewolf ever acts  like a werewolf. This shoulda been "Humans in black leather Vs. Humans without shirts." Much like the Matrix Reloaded we are merely  teased with the prospect of a true supernatural war of  fantasies most inventive creations.<p>Direction: This movie had a director? Strike three. The plot goes into all the good cliches of having these creatures really interested in science and technology, yet never show some of the good old methods of killing. These scenes try to fill up the spaces between the times of talking and when things go boom. The action scenes never become exciting. While cloning the matrix it never tries to find its own voice, instead it becomes  the echo of the tried and true nature of todays action where wire-fu and guns equal big box office.  Even equilibrium created the "gun-kata" which made it very enjoyable to watch.<p>I have no vendetta against movies that take inspiration from alot of todays most popular films. But when it chooses never to break out  into an original creation is where I find it boring and a complete waste of time to watch. Their is no satisfying aspect to this movie besides the alluring idea of watching vamps and wolves duke it out. Instead we get boring gun fights that could have been just humans fighting it out in the subway.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>Underworld: A place hidden underneath normal eyes.<br /><br />Selene is a vampire. For centuries she, and her group, the deathdealers, have been riding the world from lycons, werewolves. The war has been raging since God knows when. Now, nobody can even remember when the war began or what caused it. But everyone has the same intentions: kill the other group. For years, lycons have been growing scarce, which means that the vampires are winning. But now, the lycons are resurfacing to track an unknown human. Michael Corvin, a hospital worker, is apparently their target--but not for food. From this storyline we can get a sense that both groups want to find out more about him. Along the way there are many cool stunts, excelent history, and even a connection to science. Each person bitten, the curse of either the vampire or the werewold would get passed on like a virus. But what if a human was bitten by a werewolf . . .and a vampire? What would happen then?

In short, the World of Darkness is like our world only, uh, darker. And grittier. And full of angst. <p>Vampires and werewolves dominate the WOD. There's changelings, wraiths, and demons too. Normal humans? They're pretty much cattle. <p>Vampires and werewolves don't get along. Vampires are city folk, werewolves are country folk. Vampires like to be clean cut, werewolves like long hair and scruffy beards. Vampires hang out in old mansions drinking blood out of champagne glasses, werewolves beat the crap out of each other for fun in subway tunnels. Get the idea? <p>Not surprisingly, vampires are "winning" the war. Three elders oversee the vampire race (at least, in Europe), and one is awakened every so many centuries to lead. The movie takes place in the interim between vampire elder shifts. Kraven, the intermin vampire leader, is a turncoat who makes a deal with Lucian, the werewolf leader. Collectively, they intend to create an "Abomination" -- a serum that will turn Lucian into a werewolf/vampire hybrid. All other attempts to create such a hybrid have failed, but since vampires and werewolves supposedly share a common ancestor, mixing the two lines shouldn't be impossible... <p>Enter Michael Corvin, who has the gene to transform into a vampire/werewolf hybrid. A Wampire? A Verwolf? A Vampwolf? Nobody knows, but he looks like Nightcrawler when the transformation is through. <p>But I'm skipping ahead. Somewhere in all this messy plot is Selene, a Death-Dealer. Death-Dealers deal death to werewolves (duh). Of all the stupid names, "Death Dealer" has to be the worst. That's right up there with calling your fighter a "Sword Wielder" or your cleric "Healing Guy." <p>Selene (played by Kate Beckinsale) has a few things going for her. For one, she's hot. For another, she wields two automatic pistols. And for a third, she's a vampire. This makes her the goddess of all geek fantasies. <p>Am I oversharing? Ahem. <p>Selene was turned into a vampire by Viktor, one of the three elders. She is loyal to him (like a daughter to a father, the movie's VERY clear that it's not sexual). Only, it turns out Viktor killed her parents before turning her. <p>So for the most part, this movie is about a big build up to a mano-a-mano battle between Viktor the Elder Vampire and Michael the Half-Vampire/Half-Werewolf. Follow so far? <p>There's a few problems with the movie, not the least of which is that the sound was cranked up to eardrum twanging levels. I spoke with my parents, who also saw this movie, and they had the same complaint. This probably has to do with the enormous amounts of gunfire that place throughout the film. <p>Despite the completely unrealistic combat scenes, the movie seems to take great pride in showing characters reload their weapons. This is a little odd, as the automatic pistols themselves are fantastic conventions. Why show this at all? <p>Because on some level, it's as much about Gun Fu as it is about vampires and werewolves. Selene runs around in PVC firing at werewolves. She does that for most of the movie. There's not a whole lot of room for pacing, but a good Gun Fu movie knows that it has to give the audience a break. What better way than to reload a weapon? <p>The reloading -- and the infatuation the director has with filming it -- made me think of Equilibrium, the greatest gun flick of all time. Just as people compared Equlibrium to the Matrix (an unfair comparison), Underworld is a lot like Equilibrium meets Dark City. There's unbelievable shootouts, the main character is a death dealing machine (sort of like Equilibrium's Grammaton Clerics), everybody dresses in black, it's flimed with a gray lense, and the movie is about bucking the rules for love -- of one's family and of one's self. <p>Underworld also takes for granted, probably due to time contraints, that we all know what vampires and werewolves are. Which is funny. While they are definitely recognizable characters, they are not necessarily recognized the same way by the same generation. <p>Take, for example, my mother's interpretation of the movie. She was shocked that 1) vampires could bear children, 2) Selene could see herself in her reflection, 3) vampires displayed no vulnerability to water. And yet, they can leap onto ceilings and cling to them like spiders. I took all of this in stride, because I'm accustomed to the "de-fanging" of Anne Rice's vampires. This is now the fourth generation vampire: Nosferatu -> Dracula -> Lestat -> Selene. What you end up with are pale, superstrong, pretty people with fangs. They don't even drink blood. The vampires figured out how to clone it. <p>Which really makes the vampires the good guys. In comparison, the werewolves are dirty, violent, and come off as more than a little churlish. They're the lower class to the vampire upper class, and indeed, werewolves were the servants of vampires. So everybody wants to be a vampire and nobody really wants to be a werewolf. <p>Just like the evolution of vampires, werewolves have evolved. They no longer need to change during a full moon. Not only that, their organs regenerate. And they can run along walls and ceilings (not sure where that came from). Lon Chaney, Jr., if you could only see your progeny now! <p>The movie drags in parts, but perks up near the end with the titanic battle between Viktor and Michael. Unfortunately, Michael isn't given much to do other than freak out. His character development is almost nil in comparison to say, Selene, who gets to cry and pout and the aforementioned blowing the crap out of werewolves. <p>I liked Underworld, but it's because I'm biased. I also like the idea of the World of Darkness that the creators no doubt abhor -- Gun Fu style, monsters using their superhuman abilities to blow each other up. I mean, who doesn't like that? <p>[...] This movie is violent and a little gory. Vampires and werewolves are not kiddie fare anymore!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTSOBAPOWT3.html">A1ZTSOBAPOWT3</a><br/><p>Wow, a Romeo and Juliet with vampires and werewolves... &quot;Underworld&quot; looked like it was going to be great, but it was a huge disappointment. The story has been overkilled so many times. The action lacks style. The special effects weren't very special. A kindergartner can draw better werewolves with his or her foot. I'm sorry, but do not watch this waste.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E11HKN4IRY09.html">A1E11HKN4IRY09</a><br/><p>There are so many things wrong with UNDERWORLD it's hard to summon the energy to get pedantic whilst reviewing it.  There are some worthwhile concepts present, but all are never developed in a good fashion.<br />  KATE BECKENSALE is horrible.  A badly written character played with a badly miscast actress makes for a hard time watching with any conviction.  She just looks uncomfortable.<br />  The werewolf effects are atrocious.  With a plot surrounding a vampire/werewolf war, you end up rooting for the wolves; that is until you witness their transformation.  Bad FX.<br />  The action scenes are stillborn.  The build up is as suspenseful as slumber and the delivery is rehash.  Without some fleeting half-creativity the entire film is an all out rip-off of the ultra-far superior BLADE (1&amp;2), and borrows some inspiration from THE MATRIXes.<br />  The direction is slipshod.  Obviously lensed by a first timer working with an amateur script.  I can't believe they are already filming not one but TWO sequels.  Totally unnessesary.<br />  Check out the flick DOG SOLDIERS instead.  That film has the action, horror, and werewolves, that works with the sense to not take itself seriously.<br />  Given the subject matter, UNDERWORLD should have been a lot better of a movie.  I love vampire and werewolf films, and there really aren't that many good ones.  UNDERWORLD has both aforementioned creatures, and still ranks at the botttom of both catagories.  So I'll have to say that it's definitely bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>Take Blade and add most of The Crow and The Matrix and you have this. The latter two I didn't particularly enjoy and Underworld was just as dull and messy as the trailer made it out to be. <p>Amidst a clutter of cliched sets, impossible to differentiate from each other, and heavily overused lightning and rain (I'm sure there are OTHER ways of creating a gothic atmosphere) an uninteresting and meandering plot slowly fizzles to life. Apparently Vampires and Werewolves have been fighting for years but a couple of them want the war to end. But with no indication of who is good and bad and the lack of a clearly defined hero there's no way to engage with the characters and no reason to care what happens to them. <p>The SFX are of the jumping thru the air in slow motion while spinning and shooting and doing the laundry variety. Nothing you haven't seen a zillion times before. It wasn't interesting the first hundred times I saw it and this movie is no exception. <p>As you might expect from a movie of this sort, the music is nothing but someone murdering a thrash metal guitar. It's just noise and chaos that matches the incoherent blur onscreen. Many elements of this film lead to exciting possibilities but they've all been thrown away in favor of easy trash. Technically efficient it may well be but Underworld is a failure on every other level.<p>And what's with the title. At no point in the entire movie is there interaction with the 'real' world. Just a load of running around in sewers and darkly lit mansion corridors. The sense of having an insight into a world that is not meant to be seen by human eyes is non-existent. Even the kidnapped human acts as if the discovery of Vampires and Werewolves is nothing to out of the ordinary.<p>Highlyclichedlookinggothicmovieworld would have been a more appropriate title.<p>The one star is purely for Kate Beckinsdale in a leather outfit.<p>I have the DTS Region 3 edition of this movie. It has a great DTS soundtrack (wow, now can really appreciate the mind-numbingly loud sound effects and awful music). And the 2.35:1 anamorphic picture is super. But no matter how good looking it is, Underworld is still terrible.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EKA9XSI641C9.html">A1EKA9XSI641C9</a><br/><p>I really wanted to see this in theatres and never got the chance, so I finally have seen the movie and am not sure what to think.  I was expecting something that was maybe a little Romeo & Juliet with the Vampire vs. Werewolf thing going on, but I don't know.  This movie really didn't pay any homage to old Vampire/Werewolf mythology, it didn't really have much action, and the Romeo & Juliet thing is not really expressed and there's only one kiss between the two main people.  Kate Beckinsale is alright as the main Vampire, but Scott Speedman (you may have seen him in Dark Blue, an excellent movie) really doesn't have much to add to the film, and was sort of a waste.  I thought the Vampire Werewolf hypbrid would be kind of cool, but the transformation was alot cooler than the end result which looked like a guy painted gray with sharp teeth and claws, very creative.  The end result of this movie was a boring anticlimactic piece that is something like The Matrix was, starting its own trilogy, which is what I think they're doing.  It really has nothing new to offer now that Blade has shown us another view of Vampires, and it sure as heck isn't funny.  I can't really say you won't like it, but I can't say you will either.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>In the hands of truly imaginative people, this concept could've been a lot more fun.  Think of it Vampires versus Werewolves.  However, the biggest problem is that the filmmakers cared more about the look of the film than the story.  Specifically, the only thing this film seems to want to do is imitate The Matrix: they copy the art direction, the wardrobe, the cinematography - there are some shots that are exact duplicates.  Of all the Famous Monsters of Filmland, the werewolf is perhaps the most terrifying, but they keep getting ruined on film.  These wolves are too CGI to be really scary - and why to they need to walk on walls?<br /><br />However, the movie is not a total train wreck.  There is enough non-stop action to pass a rainy afternoon in front of the TV.  It just could've been better.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WZ1B92F81LJJ.html">A2WZ1B92F81LJJ</a><br/><p>There's barely an original moment in Underworld, and sadly those parts that are derived from elsewhere in motion picture history (that is, all of it), are derived without wit or feeling for their antecedents or the genre. <p>I have a feeling this film would never have been made were it not for the Matrix. It basically is the Matrix, only with werewolves and vamps, and a blue wash over all the cinematography rather than a green one. So we have a hard-arsed chick in a tight patent-leather cat suit toting a sub-machine gun in each hand in a subway station, driving performance sports cars absurdly fast, performing aerial flips and other acrobatics. Only she's a vampire. With a laptop. We have perpetual rain: we have the trademark Wachowski straight-down shot of rain falling away from the camera onto parked cars in a narrow alley. There's a big final punch-up between two indestructible foes in a great big puddle. <p>But while it rips off the Matrix's visuals, Underworld has neither the wit - the tongue-in-cheek film noir; the fairly well spec'd cod philosophy - nor any of the style: Kate Beckinsale is no Carrie Anne Moss, having about as much sex appeal as a Tupperware lunchbox, and I'm afraid to say the all-important fight choreography *really* blows. <p>The bits that are original, sadly, tend to foul up the rest of the picture. To wit: pitting the "lycans" (nice try, by the way, to make werewolves sound hip. Didn't work) against vampires misses the fundamental point of both genres, which is the need-to-sleep-with-the-light-on-afterwards factor: they're supposed to GET US. And DRINK OUR BLOOD. In Underworld they're knocking six shades of hell out of each other (with guns... GUNS?? VAMPIRES WITH GUNS? What the hell is going on?), so rather than being terrifying, it plays out more like a moodily lit feature-length episode of the World Wrestling Federation. You don't really care who wins as long as there is damn good fight. But, as noted, the fight choreography is Woe Ful than Wo Ping. <p>There's zero chemistry between any of Michael Sheen, Bill Nighy or the other one and Kate - it's understandable, fellahs; it's hard to love an airtight plastic container. <p>Sophia Myles plays a decidedly plot-functional blonde vamp-girl who pops up at critical moments to push the narrative along, but doesn't end up having much to do with anything. I think she's rather petulantly sent to her room just before the climax, and you never see her again. Since she was about the most interesting part of the picture, that's a pity. For my money, Myles would have been a better female lead than Beckinsale.<p>A special "opportunity knocks" award should go to Bill Nighy, who's been underachieving in British TV dramas since 1979 or so, never showing up in anything of note, who finally snags a peach of a part in Love Actually, and now you can't get the old buzzard off your screen - a fading rock star there; a sleazy Tory MP in Auf Wiedersehen, Pet; a lecherous 19th Colonel in He Knew He Was Right and a now a thousand year old vampire uber-lord in Underworld, and ALL of them portrayed as exactly the same character! Even Kevin Costner would be impressed with that! <p>Not sure what he would have made of the rest of the film, however.<p>Olly Buxton</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>A skin tight leather clad Kate Beckinsale stars in this derivative mess which tells the story of a thousand year plus war between vampires and werewolves.  Beckinsale is a vampire, or a "death-dealer", who hunts werewolves down.  One night she discovers a group of them chasing a seemingly normal young man (Scott Speedman), followed by a plethora of derivative action scenes, campy over-acting, and one too many loose ends and plot holes.  On the outside, Underworld is a stylish thriller that boasts a very attractive female lead, although Beckinsale's true acting talents aren't entirely put to use.  Speedman is wasted as the hapless sap who just happens to be the right guy at the wrong time.  The special effects (especially the werewolf transformations) are phenominal; these effects have come a long way since The Howling.  Other than that though, Underworld is just a mess.  The action scenes seem to be derivative hybrids of The Matrix, Blade, Resident Evil, and a mess of other action/sci-fi/horror films.  Plus, by the time the credits start rolling, we are left with one too many loose ends and questions, plus an ending epilogue that automatically opens the door for an inevitable sequel.  All in all, Underworld had a load of promise, but in the end it is just another derivative thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY.html">A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY</a><br/><p>Have you ever read the appendix of an epic novel?  You know the pages near the back of a classic novel like DUNE or LORD OF THE RINGS where a lot of extra information lies.  It let's you in on a thing that happened before the story and tells of kings and queen who ruled the area before the action of the actual story take place.  The new film UNDERWORLD plays like the appendix of a novel.  There's lots of extra information and yet very little substance in and of itself.<p>UNDERWORLD tells the story of Selene (Kate Beckensale, Pearl Harbor), a vampire, and Michael (Scott Speedman, Duets) a human being chased by the vampire's sworn enemies, a band of Werewolves. Selene job in her vampire clan is to kill said Werewolves, she's known as a death eater.  You see there is a war brewing between the werewolves and the vampires.  It's kind of an undead Hatfield and McCoy story.  <p>Or is it? UNDERWORLD suffers from an intriguing concept and little substance.  There is this huge back-story, that finds its way into the movie and I bet it's figured out pretty concisely.  There talk of history, and legend, and generations of vampire's and werewolves.  But that's all.  Compelling characters take a back seat, to loud and almost obnoxious action sequences and subplots running left and right with nowhere to go.<p>In fact the only reason the film focuses on Beckensale is because she's the big name star.  She comes and goes at the whim of the screenplay.  In fact I think there was a 20-minute segment near the end that she isn't even in.  The major plot of this film plays like an overlong subplot in a much more epic film or maybe even a two-part episode of a fantasy television series.  <p>In fact that's the only way a film like Underworld can work.  The film is crying out for some focus.  There's a story dying to come out.  It's right there on the surface, and instead of focusing on Selene and her fight to save Michael.  It is bogged down by this silly and overdeveloped history of the war between vampire's and werewolves.  You know what.  This movie would make a great television or comic book series.  It just doesn't work as a stand-alone film.<p>And yet I can't say I hated UNDERWORLD.  It looks too good.  Its visual style lies somewhere between BATMAN and MINORITY REPORT.  It's set in one of those futuristic cities that are dirty and disgusting, and full of horror.  A city where the sun never shines and humans are food for the children of the night.  If you like really neat eye candy this is the film for you.<p>It seems like the filmmakers took the lets see how much cool stuff we can jam into the film approach, and most of it works on a purely surface level.  It's only after you realize that if you removed most of the cool scenes you'd have nothing worth watching and that's when the Action sequences begin to grate on you.<p>I longed for a much better, more fully realized picture than I got with UNDERWORLD.  I wanted cool action sequences, but I also wanted some compelling characters and interesting story developments.  All of which fall flat under the weight of an unfocused and overly melodramatic story.  Do yourself a favor and skip UNDERWORLD.  But as consolation may I suggest you give EQUILBRIUM a try?<p>**1/2 out of 5</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>UNDERWORLD is visually impressive, with its dark, dark underworld and the lack of real &quot;color&quot; in the film.  Blues, greys, blacks, and of course a little blood red(even it is dark) combine to create an atmospheric world of evil.  Lots of flashy special effects and imaginative camerawork.  The cast does some good work:  Kate Beckinsale, Shawn Brolly, Bill Nighy, and Michael Sheen in particular; Scott Speedman walks through his role as a zombie, which is not part of the horror menu here.  So what's wrong?  The movie has no real likeable characters, as if one should like a vampire or werewolf, and there is such disregard for human or other life that it left me feeling vacant and unaffected.  Nice to look at, but empty calories.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>What can I say...

And that is for Kate Beckinsale - dressed all in black with a black leather trench coat, she's so snazzy!  :)  In fact, if you get sick of the rambling story, the nonexistent acting, and the lame dialogue, I recommend you just turn off the sound and watch Kate in peace - running around and looking cool.

Same here with &quot;Underworld&quot;.  It looks good, but the script anchors it down to sub-par level.<p>A friend loaned me this DVD to watch, so at least I didn't have to shell out any $$ for this.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>I knew before even going into this movie that it would not be &quot;pure&quot; vampire type film. Still, to be disappointed on top of that was a big letdown. I love monsters. I love vampires. I love werewolves. I would have accepted this movie a bit more if they had left out the references to these classic fiends and created a whole different type of demonic bad guy that *should* use guns. <p>Insistance on using these two familiar and well loved creatures of the night was nothing more than a hook to draw in an audience; beyond that the people/creatures had no resemblnce whatsoever to the two legendary monsters. The mere idea of these supposedly vicious and blood/flesh hungry beasties running around shooting special guns at each other for no other reason than &quot;we are at war&quot; is as ludicrous as a starving man shooting a cow and not eating it. <p>Okay, the premise? Vampires and werewolves are at war, and we don't find out why until the end, which is nonclimatic and doesn't make any sense. There is one person on the earth that contains blood that the werewolves want, the vampires see the lycans chasing the human so they chase him down too. Yawn. That's it. <p>What I didn't like about the movie? Other than what I mentioned above, the plot was so thin you could read a newspaper through it. The script was horrible, and while the premise of a battle between vampires and werewolves would be very cool, you need to include some TEETH! It was as if the scriptwriters could not make up their minds whether to make anaction-shoot-em-up movie or a horror movie, and wound out with less than the sum of both.<br />In particular is a scene when Selena (Kate Beckinsale) drives her car into the water with Michael (Scott Speedman). He &quot;rescues&quot; her after she hits her head on the windshield and gets knocked out, pulls her from thewater, gives her CPR, after which she coughs out a little water and comes to. HELLO! Vampires are dead. They are not alive. They don't breathe. They don't have heartbeats. They can't be knocked out, and they can't drown. And after all this, Selena tells Kraven &quot;He saved my life.&quot; Riiiiiiiight. What life? You're undead!<p>Another problem with the vampires was that they seem to have forgotten they can change into bats and fly away. Instead, they just stand there and let the werewolves chew them.With the werewolves, only Michael changes with the full moon (of course) but the other werewolves are changing back and forth like a malfunctioning traffic light. The special effects were mediocre; the turning of the werewolves was really no better han &quot;American Werewolf In London&quot;, and all the fighting was so &quot;A-La-Matrix&quot; that for a moment I was confused as to which movie I was really watching. <p>Okay, so what DID I like about the movie? The acting was actually verye good. Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, Michael Sheen, Shane Brolly, and especially Bill Nighy played their roles very well. The acting alone is the only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1. It is a visually stylish movie as far as dress and scenery. I liked the idea of vampires and werewolves descending from one anscestor. I thought that Viktor's tomb was very cool, and the visual effects of the awakening of Viktor were pretty slick. I am glad that I rented before buying on this one. It just got scratched off my purchase list. After viewing it, I just wanted to run out and bite someone in order to fill the hunger left unsated.</p></br><a href="../users/A109LWN9DUGPDP.html">A109LWN9DUGPDP</a><br/><p>This movie is absolutlly great from the opening scene to the end, full of action and sci-fi/horror.Whats so great?

The script may not be supremely dreadful, but it tries.  Let's just say that Underworld gives Tim Burton's remake of  Planet of the Apes a run for its money in the "Just Plain Awful" department.<p>Where to begin?  The worst part of the movie is the acting.  With the exception of Kate Beckinsale, who makes the most of a character as thinly drawn as a Saran wrap, the acting is gag-out-loud atrocious.  Worst of the lot is the actor who portrayed Kraven (yes, that's really his name), a guy named Shane Brolly whose career, we can only hope, is over.  To say that he's the worst of this sad lot means he needs to be run out of the business with a pointed stick.<p>God, I don't want to waste anymore time writing a review of this trash.  The music is loud--and bad.  The writing is cliched--and bad.  The cinematography is dark blue--and bad.  And there are so many ripoffs from other films, including spare costumes from the Matrix, that you wish that audiences could file a class action lawsuit for paying good money for this cheap rip-off.<p>Don't go.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>I suppose the one-line review of Kate Beckinsale's pseudo-horror star vehicle, "Underworld," would be, "If you're going to see one movie this year about vampires fighting werewolves in a gothic metropolis, make it this one."  Which could reasonably be interpreted as damning with faint praise.<br /><br />Len Wiseman's first directorial effort results in a visually polished, darkly handsome film.  Set in the present day in an anoymous gothic city, peopled with beautiful-yet-dangerous creatures of the night who live in fantastic mansions and drive hot Europena cars, "Underworld" offers plenty of visual thrills.  The aforementioned Beckinsale, clad in a uniform of black leather that makes Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman suit look bulky, stalks the night as Selene, the top Death Dealer for the vampires.  What does it say about the 2001 monstrosity "Pearl Harbor" that Beckinsale gives a more convincing performance as a vampire than she did as a WWII nurse?<br /><br />Using a host of flashbacks, examinations of powerfully-illustrated history texts, and voice-over exposition, the film tells us that the vampires have been at war with the werewolves, or "Lycans," for centuries.  Apparently, the lycans used to be the vampires' servants, but then got uppity.  There's also a smidgen of a "Romeo and Juliet" romance that played a role, but that's not the focus of this story.  While the war is sometimes fought with fangs and claws, it's also fought with guns and high-tech ammunition.  They stop fighting long enough to mutter ominous portents about "returns," and "prophecies," and "the war."  Nobody is having much fun being a vampire or a werewolf.<br /><br />And that ultimately is what "Underworld" boils down to - not that much fun.  It looks great, but despite the special effects (which are very convincing), there's just not that much point to it all.  Allegedly, Selene has a "romance" with a human, Michael (Scott Speedman), who is fated to play an important role in the war.  And there's also Viktor, a "hibernating" elder vampire who gets brought back to life by Selene "a century ahead of schedule."  There are a few delicious moments as god-of-camp Bill Nighy ("Love Actually") sinks his teeth into the Viktor role, but there could have been so much more here.<br /><br />While ostensibly a movie in the "horror" genre, it's really more of an action film.  There are no moments of genuine terror, and most of the potentially scary moments dissolve into hastily-cut action scenes.  This isn't a criticism, just an observation about a movie that was hyped (at least to me) as a horror film.<br /><br />There's a bit much going on with the names in "Underworld."  When a sleazy vampire is named "Craven," you're crossing the line from "showing" to "telling."<br /><br />You do have to give the filmmakers credit for cojones, however.  The movie is an obvious set-up to a series, and it takes some serious confidence if you believe that you are guaranteed a series of big-budget films based on this visually-splendid trifle.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>I watched this movie on cable, and when I went to pro.imdb.com to see if it had been released to theaters or was a direct to DVD release, I was surprised to see that it had opened in the theaters with twenty million, made fifty million total in the U.S., and added another forty-five million in DVD/Video rentals! I honestly thought, given what I perceived to be some imperfections, that it may have been a direct to DVD release.<br /><br />While watching the film I was impressed by the lighting, the cinematography, costumes (although why Selene was often dressed like Catwoman didn't make much sense), artwork - in other words, the things that make a film look good. I was also intrigued by the concept of a vampire/werewolf hybrid.<br /><br />However, if I hadn't read in the movie guide that this was a film about hybrids, I would have been lost. Vampires and werewolves looked the same to me. Perhaps there was a bulging of teeth that the vampires had that the werewolves didn't - truthfully, I don't remember. What I do remember was Lucian - as a human - biting another human and turning him.<br /><br />There is an interesting twist in the storyline that I didn't see coming, and so I give praise to the writer(s) for that. However, the story sagged in many places.<br /><br />This is a story about werewolves and vampires. Why did it look like they were cowboys and Indians, having long drawn out shoot-outs? Vampires and werewolves have extraordinary powers: *use them*! I understand that the vampires were shooting with silver bullets, which are anathema to werewolves and perhaps their best weapon (in that movie) against them, and that the werewolves MAY have been shooting the bullets made of concentrated daylight (neat idea - but it wasn't developed at all), but still: battles between vampires and werewolves would have made for more exciting action. When a werewolf attacked Viktor, and he caught it by its throat, there was real tension. The first real tension I experienced, in fact, regarding the feud between werewolves and vampires. That tension came far too late in the film. During the gunfights, there was no tension. For me, gunfights lost their appeal somewhere after The Lone Ranger.<br /><br />Also, Selene goes to great risk to save Michael, whom she apparently loves, but aside from the fact that she's hot, and he's hot, I have no idea why they liked each other. Sure, this is a "monster movie", but if there's going to be a love interest that is *really* the center of the story (think about it - if Selene didn't have feelings for Michael, there wouldn't have been a story to tell), then we need to know more about it.<br /><br />All of my complaining aside, I did enjoy the film; especially the intriguing plot twist and the climax. Interestingly, there wasn't much of a d&eacute;nouement - just a climax. I guess the d&eacute;nouement was Selene's voice-over telling us that there would be a sequel although, of course, she didn't use those words. And there will be a sequel.<br /><br />The hybrid concept was terrific - and the result of that experiment was, for lack of better description, really cool. For that reason alone I'll see the sequel. I just hope it's not another round of cowboys and Indians.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>When White Wolf Game Systems sued the makers of "Underworld" for ripping off their world, with its highly social and politicized vampires who sleep for eons and their violent emnity with werewolves, it was assumed it was because they were trying to cash in on WWGS' World of Darkness.<br /><br />Yes and no.<br /><br />"Underworld" is theoretically about vampires and werewolves, but honestly, it mostly ends up being leather-clad people shooting fancy guns at other leather-clad people. In other words, it devolves into the worst sort of World of Darkness game, with angsty gun-toting idiots killing other angsty gun-toting idiots over something that probably made sense at the beginning of the evening, but eventually just becomes an excuse for posturing and gunplay.<br /><br />In the DVD extras, one of the creators of the film says "Underworld" might be one of the best vampire movies ever made. This might be true if no other vampire movies ever had been made. As it is, it's not the worst ever -- the "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" movie holds onto the left end of the bell curve with a death grip -- but this confused, muddled and ultimately pointless film isn't much better than mediocre, at the end of the day.<br /><br />Vampire fans are advised to check out "Near Dark," "Bram Stoker's Dracula," "From Dusk Til Dawn" or even "Fright Night" or "Lost Boys" for a better vampire experience.<br /><br />A rental at best. A recommended buy only for the most diehard World of Darkness fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>Len Wiseman's Underworld has to be taken for what it is: an action film dressed up in goth-couteur with vampires and werewolves. This film doesn't have the scares of other films that include either a vampire or a werewolf or both. It is without any kind of apology a dark, gothic action film.<br /><br />Underworld's story owes alot to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, and White Wolf Gaming's Werewolf: Rage and Vampire the Masquerade. Any fans of those two pen-and-paper urban gothic role-playing game would see alot of similarities in Wiseman's film. The film starts off pretty quickly and doesn't really let up until the final scene. There are a few scenes sprinkled throughout the film to let the viewer catch its breath. These scenes would be just as good as the action sequences if not for the scenery-chewing of Shane Brolly's Kraven. Looking like a stereotypical Euro-trash vampire, Brolly's Kraven doesn't know the meaning of understated acting. Some have mentioned that Bill Nighy's vampire elder Viktor does the same, but I thought Nighy's performance was very convincing and very in-character.<br /><br />The person who really holds the film together was Kate Beckinsale. Who knew that she could be convincing as an action-heroine. Her petite form and soft-spoken demeanor actually gives her ass-kicking character some sex-appeal and both fuses well together. It didn't hurt that she pretty much spent almost the entire lenght of the film in some outfit that was all black, and either leather or latex or a combination of both. Ms. Beckinsale is both hot and dangerous in this film.<br /><br />The action sequences owes alot of The Matrix and the other imitators that showed up after the release of that film. Unlike, most Matrix imitators, Underworld doesn't overuse the slo-mo, 360-degree shots that the Wachowski Brothers' film made popular. The FX work for the werewolf change is done well, but sometimes when the Were's arrive on the scene in large groups it still has a certain artificial look to them. But overall, the film's FX work was good enough to avoid scrutiny.<br /><br />Len Wiseman has already announced that Underworld 2 will be made once everyone involved in the first film get their schedules straightened out. The ending of this film really needs a sequel to continue the story that really just started with this film. Underworld is fun and a rollercoaster of a goth-action-thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OXHLG6DIBRW8.html">A3OXHLG6DIBRW8</a><br/><p>"Underworld" is one of those movies that I can watch just about any time. While some horror purists may take exception to the folklore surrounding the vampires and werewolves portrayed in the move, I think the minor changes are logical and work well, with the exception that the vampires are a lot weaker than they should be.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me; the movie centers on the centuries long struggle between vampires and werewolves. On the surface, the vampires appear to have the upper hand with squads of "Death Dealers" (including Kate Beckinsale)  hunting down the werewolves. The twist comes when the werewolves appear to become interested in human target, for purposes other than eating him.<br /><br />The movie has a great dark atmosphere that gives a gothic feel even though it is set in the current time (except for the flashbacks). The cinematography is very good and the special effects are generally well done and certainly not over used. The acting is fairly good and Kate Beckinsale is clearly the star of this movie.<br /><br />A very enjoyable movie! Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>When the people of today rave about cinematic failures like Twilight, you can't help but wonder, "What the hell is wrong with you people?" Why aren't you people watching 'real' vampire films that are actually entertaining, like the Underworld trilogy? You mean to tell me you'd trade awesome characters who are armed to teeth for emo pansies like the Twilight characters? Shame, shame. There were some people (Including moronic critics) who said that the Underworld series is boring, and yet they raved about Twilight. Here's my opinion for why I think the Underworld series is infinitely superior to Twilight in every way.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Centuries ago, a conflict began between aristocratic vampires called Death Dealers and Lycans (Werewolves who can become human again) which still continues into modern societies. We are then introduced to the sexy Death Dealer, Selene who centuries ago was turned into a vampire by the leader of the vampires; Viktor, who raised her like his daughter. And then after an intense gun battle scene, we are introduced to Michael Corvin, who is being hunted by the Lycans over the fact his bloodline goes back to the Corvinus (The father of both vampire and Lycan bloodlines) line, which means he is the only person in existence who can be both a vampire and a Lycan. So when Selene investigates why the Lycans are after Michael, both are pulled into a dangerous adventure full of hidden secrets, forbidden love, and a lot of intense, bloody action scenes. The plot for the most part is good, but it doesn't seem to go as far as it could have.<br />MUSIC: The music in this film is great, and never fails to set the mood and entertain. I have no gripes with this area.<br />ACTION: This film is loaded with many gun and sword fights, which come with many explosions and lots of blood and gore. Any action fan should have no problem enjoying this film because it rocks. You won't find this action in a pansy, emo, sappy, teen drama vampire tale like Twilight! A true splendor of awesome bloody violence.<br />ACTING: Some people said the acting and dialogue in this film is bad. What bad acting and dialogue? These actors are great, unlike the 1-dimensional, cardboard actors of Twilight. Kate Beckinsale is a great actress and pulls of her role as a vampire action heroine very well. I have no gripes with the other actors either, as they perform their roles superbly as well.<br />OVERALL: Forget cinematic monstrosities like Twilight which are an insult to vampire films, and watch Underworld instead! This is an awesome action epic that both girls and guys alike can get into. If you're an action fan or a fan of 'real' vampire films and you're tired of the stupid Twilight craze, pick this one (Along with the other two) up as well.<br />THE GOOD: Lots of bloody mayhem, great acting, great music, and a fairly good plot.<br />THE BAD: Plot doesn't go as far as it could have.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>The Underworld Series is on my list of favorite films. The acting is superb, along with the screenwriting, special fx and music. If you like films like "The Matrix" "Van Helsing" and "X-Men" you're going to love this film. The character interaction between Michael and Selene is simply beautiful, (and very well conceived.) If ever there were a time to like a film about vampires and werewolves, it's now. Buy all three of these films now!!</p></br><a href="../users/ARMVAHWQQ9S8A.html">ARMVAHWQQ9S8A</a><br/><p>Visually, this movie is perfection.  The crisp clearness of the movie is the high point of "Underworld", as well as Kate Beckinsale as vampire "death-dealer" Selene.  Dark, vivid, and brooding, the imagery in this film is top notch.  The story was good as well, though--unlike the imagery--was flawed.<br /><br />Selene is a believable character, and I rooted for her throughout the film.  The world she's thrown into is interesting, as well as intriguing.  Even the werewolf/vampire rivalry is riveting.  However, how is Master Vampire Victor allowed to be a Master Vampire is his powers hardly rival a more recently-sired Vampire?  I have to add though, that Bill Nighy did a stupendous job as Victor, using his menacing, calculated voice.<br /><br />Back to the grips: Why do some vampires/werewolves die by regular gunshots, but some just pull them out of their chest and get back up?  Why do some vampire need to be hit with ultra-violet bullets, but some just--again--die by regular gunshots?  A lot of plot devices thrown in the movie simply don't make sense with the world the writers and directors have established but it is an all in all enjoyable movie.<br /><br />Oh, and before I bow out.  One more problem.  In the beginning, this is said by Selene: "Our war has waged for centuries, unseen by human eyes. But all that is about to change."  Nothing to that effect happens.  A few humans are killed, but nothing out of the ordinary.  Just another inconsistency.<br /><br />8/10</p></br><a href="../users/ASIA7V7CBSKD3.html">ASIA7V7CBSKD3</a><br/><p>I'll be honest - when I first saw this moving was coming out at laughed thinking it was going to be terrible and had no desire to see it.  Then I caught it on TV one day when nothing else was on.  Boy was I surprised as "Underworld" turned out to be a really good movie.  So much so that I bought "Underworld: Evolution" sight unseen.<br /><br />Beckinsale is wonderful, not just another pretty face, she actually has talent.  The rest of the cast is well cast and believable.<br /><br />Sticking to the "Rules" governing Likens and Vampires, "Underworld" will pull you in for an exciting ride as these two sides race to end war that has been going on for centuries, but to what end?<br /><br />Definately worth seeing if not owning.</p></br></body></html>

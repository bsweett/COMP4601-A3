Still though I liked it for the performances by Ethan Hawke and Lawence Fishburne. Ethan Hawke plays a cop fighting inner-demons after a undercover drug bust went wrong. Lawence Fishburne plays a famous gang leader that is sent to Hawke's precent. Hawke is forced to  to team up with him when crooked cops attack the precent. They're after Fishburne because he has something on them and they don't want him to make it to trial. Other convicts played by John Leguizamo and Ja Rule are forced to team up as well. Their parts really don't matter much though and could've been played by anyone.<br /><br />  Also there are Drea de Matteo (Joey) as a secretary that dresses more like a hooker and acts more like one too. Maria Bello plays a police  psychologist that looks a little more classy. Her and Hawke have some chemestry but the movie never lets them act on it 100%. Instead through most their scenes together Hawke just accuses her to wanting to "F" him. Plus the death scenes  don't have much imagination. There's way too many scenes where people are shot in the head. Then we get a close-up of the wound with the victims eyes open. Mostly everyone that dies, dies with a gunshot to the head. Plus there's been better movies with people stuck in a building and fighting for their lives. Still though Hawke and Fishburne deliver and make it worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>Guns are a-blazin' in ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, remake of John Carpenter's 1976 film of the same name. Guns are blazing. And that's largely it. A broken-down undercover cop-turned-desk sergeant (Ethan Hawke) is spending a quiet New Year's Eve packing file boxes in his about-to-be-closed down precinct house when cop-killer Laurence Fishburne is brought in.<br /><br />Suddenly, Precinct 13 becomes a war zone as a mysterious group of men lay siege to the building. It soon becomes evident that these are Fishburne's criminal associates, bent on killing him before he can talk. They cut the power, kill the phone lines and jam the radios. Worse yet, Detroit is enveloped in a blizzard, making escape impossible. Hawke and Fishburne, along with Police Department staffers Drea deMatteo and Maria Bello, and a handful of miscreants from the downstairs lockup become a kind of modern-day Alamo, holding off the bad guys.<br /><br />It's an exercise in adrenaline as thousands of rounds are fired and the scene is punctuated by explosions and raging fires. Why the Detroit Fire Department and the National Guard never show up to investigate the noise and flame is a good question, but reality is not a major commodity in this picture. A trackless forest and hills magically appear in Motor City, providing a backdrop to the film's climactic scenes.<br /><br />This is a good purebred action story. There is some excellent character development in the script, more than enough to make you care who wins and loses. Fishburne and Hawke act beyond the limitations of their roles. An aging Brian Dennehy does a turn as the cranky Police Chief. Drea deMatteo is pretty, though seemingly typecast as the office strumpet.<br /><br />The fetching Maria Bello is, as always, better than expected. Given Ms. Bello's relatively limited exposure and the fact that she is of an age where Hollywood eats females, it is a pleasure to see that her star is rising.<br /><br />A fine distraction, ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 will keep you entertained.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G5LJ8T1IGYC5.html">A1G5LJ8T1IGYC5</a><br/><p>ON THE NIGHT OF NEW YEAR'S EVE, A PRECINCT THAT'S ON THE VERGE OF BEING CLOSED DOWN IS SUDDENLY UNDER ATTACK BY AN ARMY OF CORRUPT COPS [IN THE ORIGINAL, IT WAS A GANG].

Great action, comedy, and a great movie.  Lots of action and lots of comedy.  I was surprised that it was funny because the trailer doesnt make it look like a comedy its an action movie but its funny.  The only thing I did not like about it was the fact that almost everyone dies in the movie.  Other than that it was a good movie.  Also Drea de Matteo and  Maria Bello are hot.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I did not see John Carpenter's original version of "Assault on Precinct 13," but that did matter to my enjoyment of the 2005 remake.  I was paying attention so I knew what the set up was, both inside and out of the precinct, as we went along.  But being ahead of the characters on this one does not do you much good because there are ample twists in James DeMonaco's script (I made the mistake of announcing right before the first assault the two characters I was sure would survive all the bullets and I was half-right, which is a polite way of saying I was half-wrong).<br /><br />It is New Year's Eve in Jean-Francois Richet's film and it has started to snow heavily.  Precinct 13 officially closes at the stroke of midnight and filling up the last boxes are Sergeant Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), who has been hiding behind a desk ever since an undercover gig went horribly bad and he was wounded while his two partners were killed, grizzled veteran Jasper O'Shea (Brian Dennehy) who is always talking about retirement, and secretary Iris Ferry (Drea de Matteo) who is always talking about sex with bad boys.  Jake would rather talk about sex than his feelings about what happened before with Alex Sabian (Mario Bello), the department shrink who happens to stop by on a snowy New Year's Eve to take another crack at Jake's psyche.<br /><br />Then a Detroit police transport bus shows up with a quartet of prisoners, unable to get to the prison because of the storm and a highway accident.  There is Beck (John Leguizamo), who will not shut up, Anna (Alisha Hinds) a girl with a crew-cut who proclaims her innocence, Smiley (Ja Rule), a counterfeiter, and Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne), the most notorious criminal in the city, who has just been arrested for murdering an undercover cop under suspicious circumstances.  So when a couple of guys with guns break into the precinct and everybody is yelling these are Bishop's men coming to get get, we do not buy it.  After all, as soon as Bishop saw them he hid behind a wall.  Things are just beginning to get interesting.<br /><br />"Assault on Precinct 13" is an action film where the human element is really more interesting once Jake figures out that to survive the night he needs the everybody, which means not only the prisoners but the women.  Everybody gets a gun in this one, but you know full well that not everybody can be trusted with one.  Furthermore, Jake is fully aware that Bishop is the smartest and deadliest person there, but this movie is all about making the best of a bad situation that keeps getting worse.  The death of one character really puts the way this is going to play out into question, and I liked the note on which the film actually ends once we finally get down to the inevitable confrontation between the two main characters.  Not great, but certainly an enjoyable action picture with a minimum amount of stupidity on the part of the characters once you accept the idea the die is cast and it is all or nothing for the bad guys.  That is a pretty good recommendation for this genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A13F2IV3ME23R.html">A13F2IV3ME23R</a><br/><p>Not going into this movie with any pre-conceived ideas I was ready to enjoy some action and mystery.<br /><br />It sure delivered!  Hawke [like that name] as Jake lead us through a mental and emotional maze.  The two women were a bit confusing [or is it a distraction]<br /><br />To me Fishburne as Bishop was a disturbing but powerful character [was he trustworthy at all??] Hate to say it but was glad he got away.<br /><br />I expected those two escapees to get it -- Was that a SWAT team shooter or an Army sniper?<br /><br />But Dennehy was the biggest surprise -- great character! [the twit].<br /><br />Precinct 13 set in Detroit was debatible - yeah! where did the trees come from?  But still, don't bother with location just go with the flow.<br /><br />Still a great movie to watch - Hey, I am not buying the production just the enjoyment of watching some action and very good, believable characters.<br /><br />Definitely Recommended - action, great pace, some mystery [Gabriel Byrne was great - just as evil as ever] - Well worth watching again.

THe original Assault on Precinct 13 was made in 1976 so there might be a fair number of people out there who hadn't seen the original, many of them age 30 or under (a desirable demographic)<br />2. The formula worked the first time around and Hollywood likes proven successes.<br /><br />IS IT WORTH SEEING?:<br />1. For fans of Ethan Hawke, definitely.Credible work.<br />2. For everyone else, rent or buy the first movie before you see this one. If the subject matter interests you ( a precinct being shut down and attacked by bad guys), you might want to take a look at the remake because there are enough differences to hold your attention.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 is as riddled with naysayers as it is with the legions of bullets flying through the air: it seems many folks just don't like re-makes of old movies!  True, one wonders with all of the fine new scripts languishing in the To Be Read bin why  Hollywood elects to buff up old ideas so often.  In the case of this film the story is worth re-telling, if only as a reminder that corruption has seeped into every form of public service - and that is something we must all address.<br /><br />The story? Precinct 13 is a decrepit building in Detroit in the process of being evacuated on New Year's Eve.  The cops it houses include old-timer Jasper (Brian Dennehy), Capra (Matt Craven) and alcoholic drug-reliant Jake (Ethan Hawke), a man with a police work failure past that haunts him.  The deserted building is left in the hands of Jasper, Jake, Iris (Drea De Matteo) and, coincidentally, psychologist Alex (Maria Bello) who is Jake's shrink, frustrated with Jake's inability to shed the past and get past his addictions.<br /><br />Because of a blizzard a patrol wagon transporting criminals to a jail is sidetracked and instructed to house the prisoners in the faulty Precinct 13 for the night.  One of the criminals is Bishop (Lawrence Fishburn) who is in cahoots with corrupt cops headed by Marcus Duvall (Gabriel Byrne).  Once the stage is set the remainder of the film deals with a siege on Precinct 13 led by Duvall in an attempt to kill Bishop before he 'rats' on them.  Knowing that Bishop has informed his fellow housebound folks, the mission becomes one to destroy all of the men and women who are confined to Precinct 13.  How this all plays out includes a lot of deaths, continuous shelling and burning and some surprises as to who is a good cop vs who is a bad cop in a fairly predictable script, but pounced along with enough tension to make it good entertainment.<br /><br />The cast plays this 'Mamet-like' closed room drama for all its worth and while there are few characters with whom one can side, the various actors deliver a solid variety of prisoners vs attackers.  Not a great movie by any means, but a challenging one psychologically.

If critics like an action remake, it usually means that it's one worth checking out. The acting is better than it should be in this kind of film, with Ethan Hawke and Laurence Fishburne being the obvious best of the bunch. I loved the intense prologue scene with Ethan undercover and Fishburne displays some of his best acting to date throughout the movie in a way that his character never gets tiresome or cliched. Maria Bello and Drea de Matteo are eye candy and not much more, but I'm not complaining. If you want to see a movie with tons of action, a tight tension filled pace, and more violence and gore than usually seen in a movie like this, check out "Assault on Precinct 13." This is easily the best action film to come out in quite some time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KL7NXOAGKD3U.html">A3KL7NXOAGKD3U</a><br/><p>Lights...Camera..ACTION!!!

An well-made remake based on John Carpenter's 1976 original. The all-star cast led by Ethan Hawke and Laurence Fishburne is superb. An mindblowing action-thriller that never gives up from beginning to end. This is one of the best remakes in recent history.</p></br><a href="../users/A37ZOGOK3GKF2P.html">A37ZOGOK3GKF2P</a><br/><p>Why remake the cult classic John Carpenter urban western?

A little slow at first, but the action heats up and lets face it, this film has a great cast.  It is hard for a filmmaker to build suspense and suprise with a remake, but there are some clever plot twists and loads and loads of action.  The language is harsh, even vulgar at times.  Ethan Hawke is food as always, but the real fun comes from Larry Fishbourne.  He is menacing yet at ease.  Another popcorn movie.

NOW, IT'S THE RIGHT HATES THE LEFT, THE CONSERVATIVES HATE THE LIBERALS TO THE GUTS, BUT THE LEFT SIMPLY WON'T GIVE A DARN TO THOSE RIGHT WING EXTREMISTS, BECAUSE THEY'RE WHAT THEY ARE, THEY'RE THE LIBERALS.</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>Going in I was expecting an Action film with two-dimensional characters and loads of gunfire caught on film with shaky camera shots to make them seem more violent than they already are.  Instead of adhering to conventional 'Action' film nonsense and one-liners, however, the makers of this film have created a story where the characters are either likeable or interesting to watch and the violence is both realistic and often incredibly brutal.  There are some cliche' plot twists that appear at the expected times, but to the credit of these storytellers they do not dwell on them as if the audience should somehow be wowed or shocked by the revelation(s).  Thus any predictability is overshadowed by quicksilver action sequences or character-driven moments that are equally intense.  This film has a strong cast of actors led by a very capable director and a fantastic production staff that give this film more style and substance than is typical of the genre.  The photography is excellent and elevates the look of this movie to a highly professional level, as do all the technical aspects such as stuntwork and gunfire during the many firefights.  The action is bloody, to put it mildly, with some gruesome kills that made even a seasoned Action film fan like myself cringe and wince.  What I especially love about this film and with very few other Action flicks is that all the characters either get hurt or mortally wounded at some point during the story.  No one escapes unscathed.  In most other Action movies it gets ridiculous to see characters running through a swarm of bullets and not getting hit; for that alone, "Assault on Precinct 13" should be raised above the average Action film fare and revered for its exceptional use of violence as a means to an end rather than as a flashy way in which to deceive an audience into forgiving a film for falling flat during the quieter moments.  Both Ethan Hawke and Laurence Fishburn lead the way with their star-power and the rest of the cast rally around them to help the viewers care about each and every one of them.  This film is a pleasant surprise and a solid addition to the Action film genre.  Thank you.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>This movie is a travesty that only proves that sometimes a great movie can be remade so badly that it loses all reasonable resemblance to the original.  This movie is so bad that it takes the premise of a group of cops and convicts under attack from a killer gang (and most real gangs are organized drug dealing killers) in a closing precinct building into a idiotic story about bad cops attacking the station instead.  It's badly written and in spite of some good actors it's just a nasty movie without much merit.  How many times in history have gangs surrounded and attacked someplace and murdered kids even to get what they want? many times... how many times has this happened with a group of bad cops? and even worse cops who act like untrained idiots!  oh well.  they lost the premise and real menace that a true evil gang can deliver because they (in some cities) are already shooting up and killing innocent people routinely , including kids who get in their way.  Sure there<br /> are some bad cops; but this movie has no charm and seems mindlessly hateful about cops in general. (I am not a cop by the way)  Skip this one and watch the original which is a crime movie classic!.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JP0URFHXP6DO.html">A2JP0URFHXP6DO</a><br/><p>In one of the featurettes on the DVD, Star Ethan Hawke claims that this was the best script to an action film he had ever read.  If this was the best that I would hate to see the worst.  This remake of the John Carpenter Cult classic is ridiculous on so many levels.  Suspension of disbelief?  No...how about suspending rational thought and logic as the totally impossible set of circumstances that lead to the siege are among the most far-fetched ever put on film.<br /><br />Lawrence Fishburne is a Detroit crime boss named Bishop who is being transported to jail along with the usual cast of two-dimensional action characters including Ja-rule As small-time crook Smiley (don't know why since he never smiles) and John Leguizamo as Beck, a crack head who is on your nerves so quickly that you pray he's killed soon.<br /><br />Well on the way an accident and a fierce winter storm just happens to divert the bus to Precinct 13 which just happens to be closing down and thus just happens to have only a crew of three people and just happens to have all their communications shut down and is evidently in such a remote part of the city that citizens do not hear the thousands of rounds of gunfire and explosions taking place and call the cops.  It may be Detroit, but even that's well beyond normal reason.  Oh and somehow the crooks manage to interfere and knock out the cell phones as well.  That's quite a trick!<br /><br />Soon, some crooked cops led by Gabriel Byrne lead an attack on the precinct in order to kill Bishop before he can expose them at his trial.  Ethan Hawke is Sgt. Jake Roenick, another two-dimensional burned-out cop feeling guilt over two of his partners getting killed in a shootout, eight months earlier.  Along with him is Brian Dennehy who just happens to be retiring, and Drea de Matteo playing her usual smart-mouthed New Yorker...even though she's supposed to be in Detroit. Oh and Maria Bello plays a shrink working with Ethan Hawke who just HAPPENS to get stuck in the storm and has to stay at the precinct as weel. Roenick soon arms his prisoners to fight off the cops.  Seemingly the cops are all former Delta Force members or Navy Seals because they're all armed to the teethe with assault rifles, night vision goggles, and flash grenades.  Yet despite their overwhelming numbers and weaponry, the bad guys find themselves picked off one-by-one.<br /><br />The sad thing is that this could have, and should have been a good film.  But rather than handle the film with some semblance of subtlety, French director Jean-Francois Richet just tries to bludgeon watchers over the head at every moment.  Extremely disappointing.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Ethan Hawke leads a well rounded cast starring as booze and drug dependent yet ethical Detroit police Sergeant Roenick in the action thriller "Assault on Precinct 13".  Eight months after a bungled drug bust in which he was wounded and two partners were killed, he finds himself in decommissioned precinct 13.  He was assigned the regretable job of manning the nearly barren station on New Years Eve, with old police veteran Jasper played by an aging Brian Dennehy and precinct miniskirted secretary Iris Ferry played by the sexy Drea DeMatteo.<br /><br />Concurrently big shot gangster Marion Bishop played authoritatively by Laurence Fishburne had been apprehended for a cop killing.  He was being transported by bus to a secure lockup with three other perps during a driving winter snowstorm.  With driving extremely treacherous the bus was ordered to wait out the storm at the deserted precinct 13.<br /><br />Much to the chagrin of all involved, Fishburne was in cohoots with a legion of rogue and dirty cops led by Gabriel Byrne playing Lt. Duvall.  Byrne and his minions could not allow Fishburne to reveal the details of their arrangement.  They aimed to silence Fishburne, Hawke and the others trapped in the precinct house using an Alamo-like siege to kill all those that could implicate them.<br /><br />This action packed thriller necessitated the collaboration of Hawke and Fishburne and all the cops and prisoners if they were to survive the attack.<br /><br />The acting performances were good for the most part, also featuring Maria Bello as a conflicted police psychologist and the immensely talented John Leguizamo playing the brain fried junkie Beck.</p></br><a href="../users/ALJGB7XHPFCR.html">ALJGB7XHPFCR</a><br/><p>Let us forget for a moment that Assault on Precinct 13 is a remake of a classic action movie. Taken completely on its own merits Assault on Precent 13 is a debacle. Lets start with the Rio Bravo style scenario. About a dozen people are trapped in a decaying police station in Detroit (If the Detroit location is giving you Robocop warm and fuzzies stop right now. It could have easily said Topeka in the opening credits and nothing would have changed. In fact the last bit in the forest would have made more sense.) Surrounding them are our bad guys; corrupt cops. Now I know what your thinking. Corrupt cops? Were the Nazis and drug cartels busy that weekend? Of course these are no ordinary cops. These guys are right of the cover of the latest Tom Clancy video game. Yup we have body armor; helicopters; laser sights; night vision goggles the works. So we have thirty or so high speed, low drag S.W.A.T./Special Forces types armed to the teeth verses 4 cops (drunk), 2 women in party dresses and half a dozen criminals. So how do our heroes defend themselves? Truth is they can't. They all should be dead within ten minutes tops. (Not to mention the characters inside have an annoying habit of walking past the windows.) Now an illogical scenario is no reason to completely pan a movie especially a B style action film. However with the exception of Laurence Fishburne and Ethan Hawke all the other characters seemed to be comic relief. While Ja-Rules and Leguizamo's characters are bad enough. It's Aisha Hind's minstrel show that takes the cake. Rarely has a more stereotypical African American character appeared on the modern screen. Her performance resembles a frat boy in blackface and drag acting ghetto. I thought Gabriel Byrne was a great bad guy, too bad there wasn't more of him in the movie.  If you want a throiller with a good plot, this isn't for you.  If you want a lot of shoot em up action, this is your movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A6DOCZ10B7JAJ.html">A6DOCZ10B7JAJ</a><br/><p>Hard to come anywhere close to Carpenter's original Assault on Precinct 13, but of course somebody had to try.  Also not really sure why this high octane American caper was handed over to a relatively inexperienced French director.  Not that Jean-Francois Richet did a horrible job, but this script is sprayed with a ridiculous amount of plot holes and ludicrous developments.  However, this remake does boast an all-star cast and a sufficient budget (30 mil), so it's not a total waste.  Plus there are enough thrills injected here to get all of you action junkie's blood boiling.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke plays Sgt. Jake Roenick, a battle tested cop who is still suffering from emotional trauma acquired on the job.  He's given a safe desk job at an old Detroit precinct that is in the process of closing.  So Jake and a group of friends/coworkers settle in to prepare for a little shindig.  But the night is about to get much more exciting, and not just because it happens to be New Years Eve.<br /><br />Due to a snow storm, a bus transferring a few prisoners is forced to make an unexpected stop.  Amongst the dangerous cargo happens to be the notorious crime boss Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne).  Believe me, he's one bad dude.  Anyway, before long the station in under heavy attack, with Bishop the supposed target.<br /><br />(MINOR SPOILER)<br />At first you think it's probably some gangsters looking to free their boss.  But no, it's actually some dirty cops that don't want Mr. Bishop to rat them out in court (not really a spoiler--that fact is revealed early in the movie).  So the cops and the crooks are forced to momentarily teamup in order to stave off these attacks.  The action is now set to get fast and violent.  Only problem is you gotta watch out for the wayward casualties of logic.<br /><br />Like annoying plot holes and such...where do I begin?<br />-bus transfer of a famous kingpin on a snowy New Years Eve night in the Motor City?<br />-sick criminal passenger is enough to change destination?<br />-cell phones, radios, telephones not working at station?<br />-how many psychiatrists work at the police department (on New Years Eve no less)?<br />-why would cops launch a "secret" attack on a precinct?  Wait til he is transferred maybe?<br /><br />But that's not to say this film is all bad.  Like I mentioned before, it has some pretty solid action stunts and gripping thrills.  There is a decent amount of tension as you anticipate loyalties evaporating at any second between the newly formed team.  Even though the story itself is a little hard to swallow, the cast makes you forget much of this.  The lead men are both in roles that seem to totally fit their personas.  Hawke as the heroic, charismatic, smart-aleck cop with deep seeded issues.  Fishburne is also great as the no-nonsense gangster that has a commanding presence.  There are other actors that give stellar performances, such as Maria Bello, John Leguizamo, Ja Rule, and Brian Dennehy.<br /><br />All in all, this ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 is watchable but highly inferior to Carpenter's original.  2.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A28GCEHD00JFZG.html">A28GCEHD00JFZG</a><br/><p>Assault on Precinct 13: 3/10: Let us forget for a moment that Assault on Precinct 13 is a remake of a classic action movie.

Granted, Carpenter's retains a certain cheesy charm (see ice cream truck) -- but the passage of time has not been kind, wooden acting, wooden lines, bad hair and low budget.  In contrast the mew Assault has a big budget, has an A-list cast for a B movie. Not a guarantee for success, granted, but director Richet pulls off the remake easily. Carpenter, to be fair, made the most of C-list actors for a B movie. And there are script improvements, with the bad guys as rogue cops rather than Carpenter's voiceless zombie-like gang members (Carpenter's soundtrack was better though). A sucessful remake in every way.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>Critics have been groaning about the unprecedented number of remakes on the 2005 Hollywood release schedule, but the first out of the bag, "Assault on Precinct 13," is not at all bad, and gives hope the year may be less oppressively redundant than it looks on paper.<br /><br />The original was a low-budget 1976 siege thriller that John Carpenter made two years before his big commercial breakthrough with "Halloween," and which he claimed was inspired by the great Howard Hawks' westerns, specifically "Rio Bravo."<br /><br />In this update (with which Carpenter apparently has no creative connection), the hero is a guilt-ridden, burned-out police sergeant (Ethan Hawke) in charge of a dilapidated, inner-city precinct that's about to be abandoned with the new year. But when a howling blizzard paralyzes the city on New Year's Eve, a police bus is diverted to the station and its handful of detainees includes a recently arrested gang chieftain (Laurence Fishburne) who intends to rat out his corrupt partners in the police department.<br /><br />So, before long, the handful of cops working the holiday shift find themselves isolated by the elements, cut off from communication with the outside world and encircled by hostile forces intent on silencing the gangster and eliminating all witnesses.<br /><br />In the original, the derelict precinct was in L.A., its attackers were a marauding youth gang with no clear motivation, there was no holiday element and the hero had little traumatic back story to transcend in the course of the action.<br /><br />Thus, this remake is considerably different and, for once, the changes have not hurt the film. Indeed, while the plot is equally improbable, the snowbound setting and new set of motivations for everyone involved have, to my mind, improved the story.<br /><br />And French director Jean-Francois Richet has managed to keep the suspense tight and action hard-hitting while adding considerable texture to the story and getting the most out of a strong supporting cast that includes Gabriel Byrne, Maria Bello, Brian Dennehy and John Leguizamo.<br /><br />In the lead role, Hawke looks so bony and unhealthy that he makes you feel uncomfortable, but he's believable and effective, and he strikes some of the same grim-faced buddy chemistry with Fishburne that he had with Denzel Washington in "Training Day."<br /><br />Even so, Fishburne handily steals the movie from him. His gangster is a soft-spoken master of self-control who can communicate a world of meaning -- and menace -- in the slightest gesture or glint of his powerful eyes. It's a terrific character performance and a lot of fun.</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>I was surprised how much I got sucked into this movie! I have not seen the original nor do I care to, it has not spoiled my movie watching experice, I have imagination and a brain, I can enjoy this withouth knocking it down.<br /><br />I loved the suspence that kept up through out the whole movie and the familiar characters I liked in previous movies, Hawke, Fishburne, Byrne, Bello to name a few, and how the loyalties between the good cops, bad cops and criminals kept changing through out the movie.<br /><br />It was fast paced, scarry at times, and you really couldnt guess who was getting killed off when, and they were not sparing the famous faces either.<br /><br />The plot was simple yet entertaining; bunch of people inside the precinct who were fending off good guys gone bad, and try to sit quiet when your own citys defenses are knocing you down.<br /><br />I really had a great afternoon watching this during my Christmas Day off, even my family loved it, and you're talking about a bunch of fussy people!</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Assault of Precinct 13 is supposed to be a remake of John Carpenter's film with the same name from 1976.  The original and the remake take place in the inner city where the police barricade themselves at precinct 13, as some wish to harm the people inside the police station.  Yet, there is a distinct difference in the two films, as there is a clear difference in the identity between the bad guys in each film.  The first film heavily borrowed from other films, as does the remake, which slightly affects the cinematic experience as not much originality presents itself on the screen.<br /><br />The story takes place in a police station that is about to be closed down. It is New Years Eve and the city of Detroit has been struck by a severe snowstorm.  Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), a burnt-out ex-undercover agent, is in charge of the almost abandoned Precinct 13, as he, soon to be retired Jasper O'Shea (Brian Dennehy), and the precincts sexy secretary, Iris (Drea de Matteo), plan on pack some boxes for the move and have a couple of drinks while celebrating the New Year.  Earlier during the same day, the police successfully apprehended the stone cold police killer and gangster Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne).  The police intend to move him to a more secure location over the night along with three other criminals.  However, the snowstorm prevents police transport to reach its location, as they decide to take shelter at police precinct 13.  The storm begins to increase in intensity and snow makes it hard to travel.  George Romero once created a similar scenario in Night of the Living Dead (1968), which gets a modern makeover treatment in this film.<br /><br />The snow ceaselessly continues to fall while Jake and his fellow police officers and newly arrived criminals realize that someone is trying to break into the police station.  It leads to a situation where snipers, heavily armed thugs, and someone who will not stop until all of them are dead take action. In the process they surround the police station in order to prevent anyone from getting away.  The idea of surrounding someone and having a shoot out until no one is left standing is a cinematic concept that could have been seen in several Westerns with John Wayne as the hero such as Rio Bravo (1959).  Nonetheless, Assault on Precinct 13 brings a modern version of the Western that still has some firepower for the audience, as it still induces some suspense and tolerable action.<br /><br />Besides the main theme, there are several side plots such as Jake is seeing a therapist due to an event from the opening of the film.  This therapist is no other than Alex Sabian (Maria Bello) with whom Jake aggressively flirts.  The other criminals offer another interesting dimension to the film.  These characters are Smily (Ja Rule), who always refers to himself through his name, Beck (John Leguizamo), a speed mouth that never shuts up, and Anna (Aisha Hind), a self-proclaimed innocent with trigger-happy finger.  Together all of the characters offer interesting side plots, tension, and suspense, as they are willing to do anything to stay alive until dawn.<br /><br />Overall, Assault on Precinct 13 offers a decent action thriller; however, there are some problematic moments in the film.  For example, using a big actor such as Gabriel Byrne prompts the audience to consider why he is in the film, which could affect the film experience if the audience begins to deduce the reason for why he is in the film.  A scene that was cool in 1990 in Die Hard 2 reappears in this film, where someone uses a sharp ice sickle to pierce into the head through the eye.  This scene provides the notion of theft instead of homage.  Also, there are some additional scenes that lack chemistry, which makes some scenes feel awkward and forced.  Besides these awkward moments, Laurence Fishburne and Ethan Hawke's performances are outstanding, as this remake ends up with a good escape away from real life monotony into something more suspenseful.</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>Well, tonight's bargain rack movie was "Assault on Precinct 13." The movie was difficult for me to understand. The dialogue was in the F-bomb dialect of the English language (that's where the F-word is used as a noun, verb, adjective and adverb, sometimes all in the same sentence, plus F-bombs were liberally dropped just as all-purpose expletives and ersatz punctuation marks) such that those of us not so well versed in that particular dialect should have been offered subtitles to help us comprehend the movie. I've often noticed that when this particular language problem occurs, the movie itself doesn't seem to have much to offer and I've thought that perhaps the language barrier might be interfering with my understanding.<br /><br />In any case,  the cast and the plot were also a bit confusing. There were a lot of good guys (cops) and some bad guys (criminals), at least in the beginning. Well, some of the good guys had to take the bad guys to a prison on a bleak snowy night and they couldn't make it because of the storm so they holed up in an old police station known as Precinct 13 to spend the night and wait for the end of the storm. One of the bad guys being transported was really, really bad and was referred to as Bishop. Well, then the precinct suddenly came under assault by a platoon of good guys (cops) who were really actually bad guys (yes, cops) and the bad good guys were trying to get the really bad guy away from the good good guys because he had the goods on them, or something like that. Anyway, it was the good cops (plus the original bad guys who were converted to good guys to help withstand the assault ) against the bad cops (originally good guys) in a fight to the finish and the casualty rate on both sides was very high, not to mention the property damage. Well, I've probably got this all screwed up, but it really doesn't matter. Let's just say it was a lousy movie with little to offer except a lot of bad language and violence..<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>With only a few hours left in the calendar year, Precinct 13, one of Detroit's oldest precinct houses, is closing. Amid heavy snowfall and unsafe road conditions, only a few lawmen remain on duty for New Year's Eve. They are headed by Sergeant Jake Roenick, a good cop wrestling with bad memories of a fatal undercover 'op' from the previous spring. The acting  in this movie is superb all the way through the cast. This movie is classic and airtight, a thriller that actually thrills you.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>Fans of director John Carpenter are in turmoil. First off, they saw the franchise he began, HALLOWEEN, turned over to various directors who made some decent and some not so decent films. Now they are preparing for a remake of his horror film THE FOG. And somewhere in between this movie, ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, became a remake. And we all know what fans of original films think of remakes.<br /><br />As a fan of Carpenter, I decided never to be this way. I always approach a movie with an open mind. Granted, many remakes omit every single shred of story that make an original work, relying more on their "own interpretation" which is Hollywood speak for yeah we kept the name to cash in on it but made a totally different movie. But you have to give someone credit for at least trying to get it right. And that happens here.<br /><br />Original? A precinct house is closing, staffed by few people, no phones or radios, when suddenly a gang who has recently acquired assault weapons attacks. In the midst of this, a prison bus shows up with a sick prisoner and a mass murderer on board. While under attack, cops and crooks join forces to stay alive. More or less a remake itself of RIO BRAVO in some eyes.<br /><br />This time around the basis is kept intact but the loose threads are rewoven. Rather than taking place in LA in the summer, this movie takes place in Detroit in the midst of one of the worst blizzards of recent memory. Does this affect the story? Simply put, no. The mass murderer is replaced with a cool and calculating killer in the form of Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne), a street gangster with blood on his hands who has been captured after killing an undercover policeman and is not on his way to jail.<br /><br />Along the way, the blizzard forces the prison bus to reroute to Precinct 13, a precinct closing down to make way for the new stationhouse. Staffed by flirtatious secretary Iris (Drea de Matteo) and retiring grizzled old cop Jasper O'Shea (Brian Dennehy). The precinct is headed up by Sgt. Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), an ex undercover cop who we watched lose his team at the films beginning. Stuck in a desk job while recuperating from wounds gained in that battle, Roenick has more psychological than physical wounds.<br /><br />Into the station comes Roenick's department ordered shrink, Alex Sabain (Maria Bello). The two banter about, he lifts his file and she leaves only to return a short time later, stranded due to the blizzard. And then it happens.<br /><br />This misplaced group finds itself under attack from outside forces that sneak in with the intent of killing Bishop. Along with his co-prisoners Smiley (Ja Rule), Anna (Aisha Hinds), and strung out Beck (John Leguizamo), Bishop sits stranded in his cell while the killers walk the halls. Stopped by one of the guards, who is then killed, the assassins regroup and begin their siege of the precinct.<br /><br />Who is this group out to stop Bishop? Is it his gang like Jasper claims? Or someone else? If you've seen the previews on this one then you already know that the killers are a group of special forces cops who were in league with Bishop and need to silence him before he has the chance to talk and sink them all. Led by Marcus Duvall (Gabriel Byrne), they will stop at nothing until Bishop and all witnesses are dead.<br /><br />As the night moves on, the attacks continue and the defenders inside the precinct unite to ward off their assailants. One by one, and in a fashion that actually surprises in its choices, this band is whittled down until it seems that no one will survive and there will be no escape. But hey, this is a movie and things like that never happen.<br /><br />The movie is filled with tons of action, the sort that most fans of the genre are looking for in films like these. But for those fans, they get more than they bargained for in the performances of the lead AND supporting actors. And the story all makes sense and ties every loose end together leaving nothing hanging (save for the ending in a good way).<br /><br />This movie may not be John Carpenter's ASSAULT. But it turns out to be a fast paced, well made action film in its own right. And if that's what you're looking for, then you won't do better than this one.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>For everything that this remake of John Carpenter's low budget, character driven cult classic does wrong, it manages to do a lot right, and while it's nothing special, it could have been a lot worse.  Beginning with a slam bang action sequence that introduces us to burned out sergeant Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke) who finds himself in charge of a police precinct which is about to be decommissioned.  Soon enough, crime lord Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne), who along with his thugs (including John Leguizamo and Ja Rule), en route to prison must make an emergency stop at the nearly abandoned precinct as a snowstorm begins.  This sets up the teaming up of Roenick and Bishop, against a crooked cop (Gabriel Byrne) who will stop at nothing until Bishop, and anyone else in his way, are dead.  The overall story and plot are practically the same as Carpenter's original, but the character development is sacrificed for over the top, glossy action.  That aside, the action scenes are nicely done, and the performances from Hawke and Fishburne save this remake from being Hollywood remake fodder.  Also starring Maria Bello, Drea de Matteo, and Brian Dennehy, this new Assault on Precinct 13 makes for mindless, action entertainment; but John Carpenter's classic still reigns supreme.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>Ethan Hawke (Before Sunset, Taking Lives) stars as cop Reddick or Rundick (one of the names) and he is spending his New Years at Precinct 13 which is gonna be shut down. Brian Dennehy (Tommy Boy) plays Jasper and Drea DeMatteo (Tv's Joey, Tv's The Sopranos) plays the hot secretary. These 3 get a surprise when two guards, Dorian Harewood (Sudden Death) and Kim Coates (Open Range, Waterworld), bring a bus load of criminals to their precinct for the night. The criminals are played by Ja Rule (Half Past Dead, The Fast and The Furious) and John Leguizamo (Romeo & Juliet, The Pest). Laurence Fishburne portraits gang leader Bishop who was caught in a shootout in a church. What the people inside dont know is that their are people on the outside trying to get in and kill them all because Fishburne has to testify at a case because he killed a cop but the real reason is, is that supposed good cop Marcus, played by Gabriel Byrne (Stigmata, The Usual Suspects) was partners with Fishburne but Byrne wants him dead so he wont rat on them and good hard working cops dont go to jail. A lively cast makes up for the rest of it...a solid beginning with Hawke doing his drug dealer speech and then it builds up into some nonsense but the action pays up and its cool to see Fishburne, Dennehy, Hawke and Byrne duke it out with each other. Leguizamo has his moments and Ja Rule is in a better role this time though he isnt impressive. Also starring Maria Bello (Tv's ER, Coyote Ugly) and Matt Craven (Crimson Tide, Masterminds). this remake of John Carpenter's classic isnt the best. It runs out of steam after the beginning but it picks up towards the end. More like 2 1/2 stars then 3.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I did not see John Carpenter's original version of "Assault on Precinct 13," but that did matter to my enjoyment of the 2005 remake. I was paying attention so I knew what the set up was, both inside and out of the precinct, as we went along. But being ahead of the characters on this one does not do you much good because there are ample twists in James DeMonaco's script (I made the mistake of announcing right before the first assault the two characters I was sure would survive all the bullets and I was half-right, which is a polite way of saying I was half-wrong).<br /><br />It is New Year's Eve in Jean-Francois Richet's film and it has started to snow heavily. Precinct 13 officially closes at the stroke of midnight and filling up the last boxes are Sergeant Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), who has been hiding behind a desk ever since an undercover gig went horribly bad and he was wounded while his two partners were killed, grizzled veteran Jasper O'Shea (Brian Dennehy) who is always talking about retirement, and secretary Iris Ferry (Drea de Matteo) who is always talking about sex with bad boys. Jake would rather talk about sex than his feelings about what happened before with Alex Sabian (Mario Bello), the department shrink who happens to stop by on a snowy New Year's Eve to take another crack at Jake's psyche.<br /><br />Then a Detroit police transport bus shows up with a quartet of prisoners, unable to get to the prison because of the storm and a highway accident. There is Beck (John Leguizamo), who will not shut up, Anna (Alisha Hinds) a girl with a crew-cut who proclaims her innocence, Smiley (Ja Rule), a counterfeiter, and Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne), the most notorious criminal in the city, who has just been arrested for murdering an undercover cop under suspicious circumstances. So when a couple of guys with guns break into the precinct and everybody is yelling these are Bishop's men coming to get get, we do not buy it. After all, as soon as Bishop saw them he hid behind a wall. Things are just beginning to get interesting.<br /><br />"Assault on Precinct 13" is an action film where the human element is really more interesting once Jake figures out that to survive the night he needs everybody to help out, which means not only the prisoners but the women. Everybody gets a gun in this one, but you know full well that not everybody can be trusted with one. Furthermore, Jake is fully aware that Bishop is the smartest and deadliest person there, but this movie is all about making the best of a bad situation that keeps getting worse. The death of one character really puts the way this is going to play out into question, and I liked the note on which the film actually ends once we finally get down to the inevitable confrontation between the two main characters. Not great, but certainly an enjoyable action picture with a minimum amount of stupidity on the part of the characters once you accept the idea the die is cast and it is all or nothing for the bad guys. That is a pretty good recommendation for this genre.</p></br><a href="../users/ATZ1LTONGHOP6.html">ATZ1LTONGHOP6</a><br/><p>On New Year's Eve, the few remaining police officers at a police precinct that is set to close the next day, and their prisoners, find themselves cut off from the outside world and under siege. Their attackers outnumber them considerably and will not stop until everyone inside the precinct is dead.<br /><br />I am probably committing a sacrilege by saying this, but even though the original John Carpenter version of "Assault on Precinct 13" is a really great film, the remake is even better. Screenwriter James DeMonaco has taken Carpenter's original idea, kept all of the things that worked and fixed all of the things that didn't. For example, in the original film, the people attacking the precinct were essentially zombies: they never spoke; they had no personality; and they kept on coming at the precinct with no fear of death and with only the flimsiest of motives. In the remake, the attackers are humanized (in the form of Gabriel Byrne) and given a motive that is strong enough to make me believe that they would lay siege on a police precinct and keep going to the death. DeMonaco also gives more humanity to the people inside the precinct. These people, particularly Sgt Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke) and gangster Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburn), are real people with real flaws, whereas in the original, I always felt that criminal Napoleon Wilson (Marion Bishop's counterpart) was a bit too honourable to be a gangster. These changes made this film a lot more satisfying for me and convinced me that this is the better of the two films. Having said that, the original is also thoroughly worth watching and I recommend that anyone who is interested in seeing this film see both versions, back to back, and make up their own mind about which is the better of the two.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I think I like this version better than the original! It has more action, it's New Year's Eve, it's snowing! At a rundown precinct, four prisoners are dropped because of weather conditions, after the New Year's ball drops, the sh#t hits the fan. Crooked cops are coming to kill Bishop, a cop-killer. The crooked cops will kill anyone who gets in their way. The good cops must receive help from the prisoners if they want to make it out alive! If you love action, you'll love ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>The 2005 Assault on Precinct 13 is an above-average remake, an efficient Saturday Night Special that never quite gets the adrenaline pumping in the action scenes as much as it could but doesn't trash memories of Carpenter's no-budget classic as much as expected. If anything, the template here is more a scaled down Die Hard 2 minus the planes, even going so far as to borrow both central plot twist and one of the more memorable killings. Ethan Hawke is in Tom Cruise-lite mode - all the focused self-righteous concentration with none of the Scientology - and Laurence Fishbourne offers a smooth update of Darwin Joston's cool criminal but Maria Bello is wasted in a nothing role that exists solely to serve Hawke's redemption backstory. There are a couple of neat new plot twists and one unexpected killing, but mostly this delivers familiar genre thrills with a comforting lack of originality. It's certainly more effective than the French near-remake Nid De Guepes/The Nest.<br /><br />The DVD extras, like the film, are satisfying without being particularly outstanding, though it's a shame the trailer isn't included.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>everything is good, ethan hawke is a nice actor, laurence fishburne is a great man. his acting is real and he gives you a lot more than you bargained for. excellent job, drea de matteo, ja rule, john leguizamo crazy vato loco. seems to bring that bit of spice in just about any movie his in. talented and doesn't hold back, the action, the suspense, the whole thing. the criminals, the bad guys, and the cops, the good guys, or are they? this gave me my action fill, good has to unite with the bad to make it through. they're held up in this police station. kind of like hostages because the bad, or is it good, guys won't let them escape with their lives. all hell breaks loose and these criminals have to learn how to get along with these cops in order to find a way out before the nights over. i really recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>I watched this movie and was on the edge of my seat the whole time.

I recommend this movie that likes the good cops, bad cops scenario.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Though this type of story has been done many times (corrupt cops have to silence those who know about them before they are exposed) this movie is very "watch able" and tense throughout.  This is probably due to the excellent acting of Ethan Hawke (as a cop that takes a desk job after making bad decisions that cost his partners their lives) and Larry Fishburne (as a mob boss that has the goods on the corrupt cops).<br /><br />Basically it is New Years eve and Fisburne and a few other bad guys (including a kind of annoying John Luzgamo), being transported to prison,  are brought to police precinct 13, which is due to be torn down.  The reason?  Because there is a huge snowstorm going on that is blocking the access roads and there is nowhere else to bring the prisoners in the storm.  Hawke is on duty with Drea Matteo and Brian Denahy (who is getting ready to retire from the force) in the building because it is the holiday and are not really equipped to take care of the prisoners they are asked to house in their holding cells.<br /><br />All is quiet until some attackers try to get into the holding cell apparently to get at Fishburne.  The police on duty are outmanned and way outgunned by the intruders and they have to figure out a way to hold them off since no help is on the way anytime soon (the bad guys have jammed any communications with the outside).<br /><br />The movie is fraught with tense moments and some good action.  There is a lot of great interactions between Fisburne and Hawke.  My only problem is that it seemed like the entire police force was in on the corruption which seemed a little implausible.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Don't go into this believing it is anywhere near credible. Far to many cops on the take with high end equipment to get anywhere near what could be possibly true. They even have a helicopter that can fly in snow storms for assaulting a building. Now that I have established this premise is more fantasy than not, I will say it is still fun to watch. I did get a little tired of all the headshots. It is as though the director likes to see bullet holes in peoples heads. So expect to see most the stiffs with a hole in the middle of their head.<br /><br />The acting is decent and the effects are good. If the back story had been a little more plausible and fewer police with more realistic equipment had been used, it really would have done better I think. John Carpenter's original "Assault on Precinct 13" premise was better. In a nutshell this version has a handful of police and criminals holding off about thirty plus officers, many armed like S.W.A.T. with the latest toys. All for one bad guy that will tell they were partners in crime. Well as I said a bit much, but you will get lots of shooting action. The DVD is good quality and it includes some extras.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>John Carpenter cult classic is revamped for the new generation with more actions and violence by the hand of Jean-Fran?ois Richet, promising newcomer from France. This is a kind of action film that would be described as Great B-Action film, and newer `Assault on Precinct 13' would be a real treat for the action film fans despite some obvious flaws in some of its chapters.<br /><br />I said this is a `B' movie because its plot requires us to suspend our disbelief. In the remake (of actually remake of `Rio Bravo'), the police station is attacked by masked killers whose identity most of you find soon, and some of you find incredible. At the New Year's Eve, they can surround Precinct 13, block the communication from there (including cell phones), and attack the place with lots of guns. Perhaps someone in Detroit City must be hearing the noise, isn't it? But no rescue team arrive there, and those who are inside have to fight back with whatever method they can use.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke plays a good cop doing only desk work whose botched mission 8 months ago is still traumatizing him. After the formulaic opening, the film really gets into gear when Lawrence Fishburne, big-time gangster is brought to the precinct for the night. With ill-assorted team including the sexy secretary and fast-talking drug dealer, they try to survive the assault from the outside.<br /><br />As I said `Great' the action sequences in the mid-section of the film are very effective. The cold tone of the film (and the snow constantly falling from the sky) perfectly matches the bloody actions, and the strong performances from the two leading actors really help. Though all the characters are `types' and there is nothing about the character played by monotonous Gabriel Byrne, but the supporting actors -- John Leguizamo, Maria Bello, Drea De Matted, Ja Rule, Brian Dennehy - do their best. But naturally, it is Fishburne whose charismatic existence is undeniable.<br /><br />So is it good? Yes, but not all of it. In addition to the all-too-familiar opening chapters in which the film perhaps unnecessarily tries to explain the background of the principal characters, the concluding section of `Assault on Precinct 13' is very disappointing, not because of the twist given to it (and some of you can anticipate it), but because its prolonged coda. Only in that part the film reminds us of its B action premises, in which the film seems to think things must be in the right places while the audiences are actually waiting for something different.<br /><br />It is still a reasonably thrilling action. Like `Hostage,' however, you have to believe what is totally unbelievable in order to enjoy watching it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9.html">A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9</a><br/><p>Answer: Not many!

I thought the story to this movie was stupid, and unbelievable.The movie had some decent action here and there, but the fact that 90% of the movie took place in one spot,made it boring.  The only good thing I can really say about this movie was, that the sound quality was very good.  If you have a good home theater system, you'll be impressed with the sound.

A corrupt policeman (Gabriel Byrne) will do his best to eliminate the dealer and masked behind the law will try to take by assault the named precinct no matter how the prize be.<br /><br />Some spectacular sequences and a kinetic rhythm confers to this thriller major scope</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>"Assault on Precinct 13", newbie French director Jean-Francois Richet's terminally brain-damaged retread of John Carpenter's legendarily spooky pulp classic, is actually TWO movies.<br /><br />Movie #1: is actually good, and in Assault's hyper-kinetic opening sequences serves up a police drug-bust gone horribly wrong and sets the stage for what you think is going to be an amazing action flick. Ethan Hawke (playing Detroit PD Sgt. Jake Roenick)goes right to work, seizing control of the screen from the first second, sporting a buzz-cut, meth-ruined chompers, and an addict's goofy grin and acid-fast rambling conversation as he lures two Serbian druglords into a sting---and makes a *really* bad call, which sets us up for Movie #2 and had me thinking I was about to see something groundbreaking.<br /><br />Movie #2: Boy was I wrong---Movie #1 is only about eight minutes long, so basically "Assault on Precinct 13" *is* Movie #2, and unlike Movie #1, this ain't a good movie---nor is it interesting enough, or take any real risks, to be truly bad. Like the title character from "Shirley Valentine" said of her husband, "It's not that my old man is bad---he's just no bleeding *good*".<br /><br />The same can be said of the new "Assault'", which tries desperately to be hip, hard, cold, technical, and cool---and falls on its face. "Assault on Precinct 13" takes place on New Year's Eve, in a Detroit police precinct house that is being shut down (no phones, no computers, no way to call for backup---you getting that sinking feeling?) on the snowiest, nastiest, coldest day of the entire year. Sgt. Roenick (Hawke) and company are closing the station down and getting ready to party like it's 1999---er, 2004.<br /><br />Midway through the festivities, the prison-bus transporting Uber-bad-dude Maurice Bishop (Lawrence Fishburne, reclaiming both dignity and cool after his Eat-a-Burger stint in the last two Matrix movies), a druglord being prepped for trial, has to make an emergency stop at Precinct 13. Baddies with ski-masks and black SUVs show up shortly thereafter with enough firepower to knock off a third-world country(and have stuff left over) and a hankering to send Bishop into the hereafter.<br /><br />Result: Siege. Grand Result: Total boredom.<br /><br />Stuff I liked:<br /><br />1) The killer opening sequence and Ethan Hawke, who---much as he did in "Training Day"---takes standard, mediocre action fare and brings his entire being to the material. Jake Roenick is nothing we haven't seen before ("Lethal Weapon"-lite, actually), but Hawke makes us care. Nice job.<br /><br />2)Lawrence Fishburne as a hip one-liner spouting cool-Machine. It's nice to see Fishburne get his mojo back.<br /><br />3)I LOOOOOOVE techology!---and in the new Assault, we get tons of it: machine guns, assault rifles of every stripe and sort, hip little MP-5 shooters, tracer bullets, sniper scopes, laser targeting, nightvision goggles, you name it, Assault has it.<br /><br />4) CGI-snow: I'm not being nasty, I thought the CGI-snow worked---it looks great. Frankly, the movie looks great: the bleak sequences where Hawke is driving to the stationhouse in his Mustang, the vast stretches of Michigan industrial-slag scape, the fight in the woods, the deserted factories around the stationhouse---Assault may not *be* good, but it looks good.<br /><br />5) Retro-songs: "You're nobody Til Somebody Loves You" took me back to "Diehard", which this movie badly wishes it was.<br /><br />6) John Leguizamo & Brian Dennehy. Leguizamo (Beck) owns this movie as a strung-out junkie con, body by Meth, politics by Che Guevara. He owns every single scene he's in. Same with the action sequences: the only time "Assault" ripped and roared, Leguizamo had the gun. Brian Dennehy (O'Shea) is at his overweight-veteran-character-actor best, and gets the grooviest death scene I've seen in years.<br /><br />Things that stunk up the joint:<br /><br />1)The Siege Idea itself: Gabriel Byrne (Duvall) makes the stupidest decision ever: why send your loaded-for-full-warfare henchmen to kill cops at a police precinct, even if you absolutely, positively have to kill the bad-guy overnight? Wouldn't one single sniper on a rooftop when Bishop gets to his destination have been just as effective? Why take the risk?<br /><br />2) Don't let French people direct American action flicks. I loved Luc Besson's "The Professional" as much as anyone, but the SWAT team thing (sending cop after expendable cop to "check it out", just so Jean Reno could rack up a bodycount) did *not* reflect any kind of reality in terms of SWAT ops.<br /><br />Same here. Byrne's guys are truly the gang that couldn't shoot straight: from the pathetic opening attack, to the one-time use of their laser-scopes, to the inept snipers, to the hapless and over-equipped assaulters---the bad guys in Assault make Imperial Stormtroopers look like crack shots, while Byrne sits in his SUV, drinks coffee, and sulks.<br /><br />3) Ja Rule. Every scene he's in made me pray for his brutal, violent death. Note: Violent, yes, but not nearly brutal enough.<br /><br />4) The Action sequences are crap. Richet uses extremely close cuts and quick editing, so you can never see what's happening. We also never really get a good idea of the stationhouse layout or the neighborhood geography, so the boundaries of this siege are never spelled out. As a result, I could care less about when the troops are moving in, or from what angle.<br /><br />The new Assault could have been a contender, but instead emerges as an object lesson in how not to kill a bad-guy. It's the cinematic equivalent of a Big Mac: greasy, cheesy, mediocre, and instantly forgettable, and leaves you fat and sluggish afterwards. Check out the original Carpenter classic instead.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>The only reason I enjoyed this movie was for the good action scenes and because of Laurence Fishburne who was great as usual. But, the movie was kind of dissapointing.<br />It's about a presinct that gets more than it expected on New Year's eve. A group of men invade it showing no mercy and wanting Bishop (Laurencre Fishburne) a bad criminal. But to take him out, they're willing to take out everyone in the presinct. So, all of the prisoners must join with the few cops to resist this mysterious group of people.<br />The movie for is really repetitive and had way too many cuss words. Also, John Leguizamo was SO BLOODY ANNOYING. He just wouldn't shut up, I mean you'll be so annoyed by him and you'll be wishing for him to get shot so that he'll just shut up. Also, Ethan Hawke isn't an actor I like that much so that took into play. There's some descent action and thanks to Laurence Fishburne, it was ok. I wouldn't even rent it because of the repetitive action and stuff and because of John Leguizamo. I mean you don't know what's annoying until you've seen him. So, if I were you, I wouldn't do like I did and stay away from this. Actually, this movie's worth 2 and 1/2 or 3 stars but John Leguizamo just dropped it down a notch.<br />I mean, picture a crying baby who is just crying nonstop. Ok? Well, John Leguizamo is a lot more annoying than that. And at the end of the movie, you'll be thinking: Stop talking!!!!!!<br />But, don't worry John, you didn't ruin the movie! You just made it a lot worse!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>I can't find Assault on Precinct 13 on fullscreen that suck. This movie doesn't look like the remake of the original movie that was made back in 1976. I was surprised. This movie is fun. I like the characters and the action is well paced. Ethan Hawk's character was the same as his character in "Training Day". Both characters were named Jake and once again he's the good cop fighting the bad cop. Expect lots of twists and betrayal, violence, sex talk in this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JPFWKS83R49V.html">A3JPFWKS83R49V</a><br/><p>Hollywood remakes are usually weak, but this remake of the 1976 movie is a pretty good one, with some good suspense and drama. It stars Ethan Hawke and Laurence Fishburne in the main roles, with a pretty good supporting cast of heroes and villains.<br /><br />The storyline of this movie involves a gang of men who attack a police precinct where a mob member (played by Fishburne) is being held prisoner. They attack because they are trying to get this guy. As a result, the cops and prisoners decide to take up arms together to fight this outside enemy. They are still adversaries and they distrust each other. But they know they must join forces if they want to win this battle.<br /><br />Is a plot like this realistic? Possibly, and the characters make it seem halfway believable. But some parts of this movie aside from the plot itself make it seem unreal. For one thing, the guys inside the precinct- both cop and criminal- seem a little too cool. They know they are under attack, but they act very relaxed about the whole thing, which isn't much like reality. Second, there is little intervention taking place on the outside. If something like this really happened, I would think (hope) the outside world would quickly be made aware and would send help. Or, at the very least, there would be reporters and local people gathered around while the event was taking place. In this movie, there is really nothing at all on the outside. No one in Detroit (where the movie is set) seems to care at all that this police precinct is under siege.<br /><br />Still, I think this is a good movie to watch. If nothing else, it is worth watching just to see Laurence Fishburne in action. He and Hawke steal the show with their chemistry and their strength of person and character.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>We straggled through Saturday's blizzard in a Long Island movieplex to find ourselves the only ones in the audience, proving our dedication to action films.  As others have noted, the film is all about snow, so the mood was oddly muted.<br /><br />I never saw the original, but this version was terrific, well acted by Ethan Hawke, Maria Bello and others--even Ja Rule was refreshingly good as "Smiley," always talking about himself in the third person (i.e., "Smiley doesn't like that!")<br /><br />The fellow who plays the current Lieutenant on NYPD BLUE shows up in this film too, he's even more repellent here, but shows a side of himself that I liked.  I found the film well structured, tense, satisfyingly stylish.  OK, so the bad guys' plot was a little overdetermined--you wouldn't think they'd be able to muster up dozens of co-conspirators at apparently a day's notice.<br /><br />Drea Di Matteo was just the same as she is in The Sopranos, except she was lit and made up horribly, she looks like death and should sue the director.  She plays a secretary, "Iris," who likes to have sex with "bad boys," and this bizarre conception just makes you feel sorry for the actress.  Lawrence Fishburne plays her opposite number, and nowadays he's on the chubby side, looks like he's bursting out of his tight sleekly cut suits.  Who ate all the pies, Lawrence Fishburne?<br /><br />Maria Bello has a truly good part for once as the psychiatrist with a romantic interest in Jake (the weary cop played by Ethan Hawke).  I won't reveal what happens, but when she utters the line, "A hundred" (and those of you who have seen the film will know the part I'm talking about), you really feel for her, she shows remarkable bravery and an impressive heroism.  She's one you'd like on your side.<br /><br />We were screaming and cheering all the way through it.  Try to get to see this while it's still in a big theater, you'll have a ball.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>Assault On Precinct 13 is an action packed film starring Ethan Hawke (Training Day), Lawrence Fishburne (The Matrix), John Leguizamo (Carlito's Way), Brian Dennehy (First Blood), Ja Rule (Scary Movie 3), Gabriel Byrne (End Of Days), and Maria Bello (Secret Window).<br /><br />The story is set on a very snowy day in Detroit where a group of the city's dirtiest criminals including cop killer and big time gangster Marion Bishop, played by Fishburne, are held in broken down Precinct 13 managed by troubled cop Jake Roenick, played by Hawke, and a few of his staff. All of a sudden, an army of corrupt police officers led by Marcus Duvall, played by Byrne, storm the precinct in an effort to kill everyone inside for the sake of getting their hands on Bishop. Jake finds himself put in a dilemma where he will have to put his hand in the hands of criminals to survive throughout the night and make it out alive.<br /><br />The script, like the story, is vague. Ethan Hawke, who earned an Oscar nomination for Training Day, seems to be overacting; the screenplay, on the other hand, seems to have been written over a short period of time, giving the actors little to work with. And throughout the time the poor good guys and bad guys were held in the precinct, I was wondering why didn't anyone pick up a cell phone and call for back up!?<br /><br />Mindless action movie lovers will love Assault, but avid film-goers, like myself, will most definitely pass it by.<br /><br />Not really recommended<br /><br />D+</p></br><a href="../users/A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ.html">A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ</a><br/><p>Sgt. Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke) is a burnt out X undercover narcotics officer with a painful past. A few years back...while involved in an undercover sting, things went horribly wrong; leading to the death of 2 of his team officers.<br /><br />Fast forward a few years later to New Years Eve and Jake now has a low stress level desk job at soon to be defunct "Precinct 13". He drinks and pops pills on the job in an apparent attempt to forget the memories of that horrible day and of his fallen comrades.<br /><br />This is the last night of operation at "Precinct 13", as it will close after New Years and the remaining officers are to be transferred to a newly built and bigger precinct across town.<br /><br />A blizzard is raging, and in an attempt to transfer some prisoners to another locale, the harsh weather conditions force some local officers driving a prisoner transport bus to make a pit stop at "Precinct 13" until the weather clears up. Along with 3 other lowly criminals comes Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne) a high profile gangsta just busted for a cop killing.<br /><br />There are only 4  people at "Precinct 13" when the bus arrives. Sgt. Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), soon-to-be retired Officer Jasper ( Brian Dennehy), Officer Iris Ferry (Drea de Matteo), & police physcologist Dr Alex Sabian (Maria Bello) who was detoured from an earlier visit by the snow.<br /><br />Soon...all the officers find themselves fighting for their lives as assasins stake out the building from outside and try to weasel their way in. At first it is assumed that they are Bishops henchmen, looking to free him and help him escape. This quickly proves not to be the case, and the officers AND the prisoners find themselves working together to fight off the deadly intruders.<br /><br />"Assault on Precinct 13" is a formulaic action movie, but now a days, aren't all action movies that way? The film flows nicely, has some pretty intense shoot-outs, and some nice blood and gore to top it off. Hawke's and Bello's performances are the stand-outs, but they are accompanied by a well rounded cast of good actors.<br /><br />All in all, "Assault on Precinct 13" is a pretty decent and entertaining shoot-em up action flick. If you enjoy films of this nature, this one is worth at least a rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>After watching this slick, snazzy, and wholy unnecessary 2005 remake of John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13 (1976), which, by the way, was a remake of the Howard Hawks/John Wayne film Rio Bravo (1959), I found myself asking one thing...where the hell is the cholo?  If you've seen the original, you'll know what I'm talking about...if you haven't, then search it out, because it's an excellent film, much better than this one, which isn't actually half bad, but then again it's only about half good...make sense?  Probably not, but like Jesse `The Body' Ventura's Gatlin gun wielding character in the movie Predator proclaimed, "I ain't got time to make sense."...oh, wait, he actually said "I ain't got time to bleed."...well, I ain't got time for neither...directed by a Frenchie named Jean-Fran?ois Richet (Ma 6-T va crack-er, De l'amour), the film features Ethan `Chicken' Hawke (Gattaca, Training Day) and Laurence `Cowboy Curtis' Fishburne (Apocalypse Now, "Pee-wee's Playhouse").  Also appearing is Brian Dennehy (Cocoon, Silverado), Maria Bello (Payback, Auto Focus), Jeffrey 'Ja Rule' Atkins (The Fast and the Furious), Gabriel Byrne (Miller's Crossing), Drea de Matteo ("The Sopranos"), and John `Motormouth' Leguizamo (Spawn, Land of the Dead).<br /><br />Hawkes plays Sgt. Jake Roenick, a burnt out, pill popping, police officer/alkie bum (he likey the booze...he likey it a lot) hiding behind desk after a previous incident with some Serbian mobsters resulted in an injury to himself along with the skagging of a couple of undercover cops under his command (I bet Roenick will have to come to terms with his various `demons' at some point later in the movie).  The precinct he's currently working, in Detroit's inner city, is scheduled to be shut down, operating only a skeleton crew on New Year's Eve, including Sgt. Roenick, sassy secretary Iris Ferry (de Matteo), and the world's oldest policeman Jasper O'Shea (Dennehy).  Should be a quiet night, as most all responsibilities have been transferred to other precincts, but trouble arrives in the form of a bus carrying some prisoners, diverted to Precinct 13 due to worsening weather (winter in Detroit is about as fun as it gets).  Among the felonious assemblage is Marion Bishop (Fishburne), a preeminent crime figure in town, and most likely the one the heavily armed, masked men who show up shortly afterwards, surrounding the building, are after.  Discovering all communications to and from the outside world are cut off, Roenick makes an uneasy alliance with the prisoners, to which they manage to fend off an initial assault...but tensions are high within the precinct as trust doesn't come easy, and tempers flare up as the realization that their chances of surviving are about as good as that of a one legged man in an ash kicking contest (meaning not very good).  Who are these highly organized, well-armed, masked men intent on killing everyone inside the precinct, including Marcus?  The initial thought was they were Marcus' men, coming to rescue him, but that seems not the case, now...<br /><br />In terms of technicality (a well put together movie) and performances (in general), this film would probably rate pretty high, as there's quite a lot of effort from many different sources here (check out the various `making of' featurettes).  In terms of predictability (in both the story and characters), along with my bias towards Carpenter's original film (and story), this movie would rate pretty low...combining these two factors together, my overall attitude by the end was that of `meh'...what's `meh'?  `Meh' means had I gone my entire life never seeing this movie, I wouldn't have missed anything, but as far as spending just over an hour and a half watching, there are a lot less meaningful things I could have spent my time on, like removing the lint from my belly button, or practicing my animal grooming techniques on various neighborhood animals (ever see a yellow Lab with an afro?).  The main difference between this film and the original, in terms of the story, is the outside antagonistic element that drives the various degrees of conflict within the precinct.  In the original this was comprised of a somewhat enigmatic, multi-racial mass, intent on exacting revenge on some poor schmuck who happened to wrong them, and had since sought refuge in the soon to be closed, skeleton crew, precinct.  In this remake, the antagonists are a bit different, a lot more organized, and a lot more defined, and that's where I perceived the most noticeable flaw, in defining that which should have remained undefined.  Part of the story here relates and illuminates this antagonistic factor, destroying the supernatural element present in Carpenter's original film.  Ah well, I suppose it could have been worse...the performances are very strong, even if the characters seem somewhat generic, and the sets and special effects outstanding (there was a good eye towards detail, even though it may not have leaned towards the factual side of things).  One thing I did noticed was there seemed to be an awful lot of head shots...lots of people getting it right between the eyes...also, watch as Hawkes pulls off a `Die Hard' moment, piercing an attacker through an ocular orifice with an icicle...throw in a knife in the jaw, a phosphorus, flash grenade in a pocket, and you've got some pretty interesting bodily injury sequences (things that make you go `ewww').  As far as the performances, I thought most did well, but I was unsure the point of Maria Bello's character of police `shrink'...she was easy on the eyes, but seemed to have little other reason for being in the movie as her `relationship' with Hawkes' character never amounts to anything.  As far as Jeffrey 'Ja Rule' Atkins, well, he dies pretty good (what more could you ask for here?  Well, a better actor, I suppose, but, like I said, he dies good)...the film moves along at a pretty good clip, but stumbled badly in two aspects, one being the persistent and obvious notion that one of those inside the precinct was a traitor, working with those outside (the offender might as well have been wearing a neon sign stating `RAT'), one whose identity the filmmakers tried to obscure later on through the lame tactic of introducing a relatively new character into the group, and the second being the incredible lull between the initial attack from those outside and any subsequent attacks...they made an excuse about waiting for an `AV'...I'm no expert on acronyms, but I assumed this meant armored or assault vehicle (perhaps a JL421 Badonkadonk Land Cruiser/Tank...look it up, as you can buy one on the Amazon website), but given their capabilities and time constraints (the night time is the right time), I would have assumed more in terms of actual assault.  All in all an enjoyable, exciting, sometimes violent diversion, but lacking and flawed when compared to the original...<br /><br />The anamorphic widescreen (2.40:1) looks really sharp, and the audio, available in both Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1, comes through exceptionally well.  In terms of extras, there's four featurettes that go through various aspects of production, a HBO featurette titled `Caught in the Crosshairs', deleted scenes with optional director's commentary, and an audio commentary track with the director Richet, writer James DeMonaco, and producer Jeffrey Silver.  Also included are some previews for other DVD releases including Unleashed (2005), White Noise (2005), and Seed of Chucky (2004).<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />By the way, a remake is something unoriginal Hollywood types pass off on us when a sequel isn't feasible...and then, of course, there's always adapting old television shows into movies...</p></br><a href="../users/A363QRXP83K8ZE.html">A363QRXP83K8ZE</a><br/><p>Once you get past the obvious crime of remaking the Carpenter cult classic, itself a takeoff of Rio Bravo, you can while away two hours here with handsome production and a lot of people getting shot in the head.<br /><br />It's not terrible, by any means.  First, recognize that every single film you love will eventually get remade.  Hollywood has been doing it from the beginning.<br /><br />In this updated, updated Western, it's New Year's Eve and a decrepit Detroit police station is about to shut its doors for good.  There are a couple of cops, a secretary, and a lot of dust and antiques left.  No computers, the phone lines are down, and a raging blizzard outside.  All is well as the few folks left inside drink and celebrate.<br /><br />The just-arrested kingpin of Detroit, Bishop (Laurence Fishburne) is being transported to jail on this very night, and with the roads a total mess, the bus is forced to stop at Precinct 13 for the night and store its human payload in the ancient, Hannibal Lecter-esque cells.  Bad news for everyone inside.<br /><br />Turns out that Bishop has many a dirty cop on his payroll, and recently whacked a cop who tried to shake him down.  So now an army of cops, headed by Gabriel Byrne, decide to assault the police station and take out Bishop and everybody else inside.<br /><br />What follows is a lot of shooting, explosions, human drama, etc, etc.  There isn't much logic, and the absurdity keeps escalating until the finale, which takes place in the woods, which appear to be right down the road from downtown Detroit.  I don't know Detroit, but I really, really doubt there are thick woods right near the rotting industrial area near downtown.  I'm just guessing.<br /><br />Anyway, the whole thing becomes truly amazing.  Byrne and his crew, and there has to be like 30 of them, manage to commandeer SUVs, body armor, sniper rifles with scopes, automatic weapons with silencers and cartridge-catchers, stun grenades, night vision goggles, and what amounts to the most high-tech gear, including a helicoptor(!), and yet, yes, I will spoil it, they have amazing difficulty taking a falling-down police station staffed by a handful of people with 1/50 of the firepower.  It doesn't make any sense.  Attack after attack is repelled as our heavily armed dirty cops, who presumably all told their wives they had to 'work' on New Year's Eve, bumble their way around.  Sure, they manage a few cool tricks, and they kill their share, but seriously, this operation should have taken about 10 seconds of breaking down the front door and blowing everyone away in a hail of automatic fire.  Instead, Byrne and Co set up shop for HOURs, with nobody noticing.  Blizzard, sure, but even in the worst part of Detroit, something tells me somebody would notice a commando squad seiging a building.  Oh, and everyone's favorite modern-day technology, the mighty cell phone, is conveniently neutralized as someone is 'jamming the frequencies', a line thrown out there and just accepted.  Not only are these cops packing more gear than the Delta Force, they're jamming cell phones, cutting power, calling air support.  Seriously, this is the most incompetent bunch of over-equipped lackies since the Imperial Storm Troopers all poured through that hole in the wall at once in the original Star Wars.<br /><br />The movie has plenty of violence, people getting shot, a good beating, a random samurai sword, molotov cocktail action, gratuitous guy on fire, a whole bunch of people getting shot in the head and some really pointless shots of the brain-hole bleeding that must have really meant something to our Frenchman director, a doublecross, a lot of CGI snow that, at one point, isn't falling from the sky at all but just swirling around in the air like a snow-globe, and Ethan Hawke giving it his all as a troubled, alcoholic, pill-popping, skinny cop.<br /><br />It's watchable, there's enough action, your usual character scenes before said characters get bullets in their respective heads, blah blah blah.  In the end, the true accomplishment is the ability to take $40 million or however much this thing cost, and completely miss what Carpenter was doing with $100 back in 1976.  That's the magic of Hollywood--to remake an old idea with 200 times the budget and make better-filmed, more advanced, more expensive crap, and craft a master hack career in the meantime.  With this and The Fog appearing in 2005, it's truly only a matter of time before somebody comes out with their 'vision' for a Halloween remake, or more likely, an Escape From New York remake.  With more bullets to the head.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>This exercise explains why you should never remake a film that was great, as was "Assault on Precinct 13" when it was made by John Carpenter in 1976. The star power on parade in this flick -- Gabrial Byrne, Ethan Hawke, Drea de Matteo, Maria Bello, Lawrence Fishburne and John Leguizamo -- cannot save this  from being little more than an overtly violent Xerox copy of the original with none of its panache or imagination.<br /><br />While Carpenter's original -- a remake of the Howard Hawks-John Wayne western "Rio Bravo" -- was bold, exciting and unpredictable with a plot that emphasized chaos, this film is unbold, sometimes exciting and goes too far to explain every little detail about why the gang is attacking the police station that is closing on New Year's eve. It not only does nothing the original didn't do better, it leaves nothing for the audience to figure out on their own.<br /><br />While Carpenter's original cast a bunch of no name actors with no budget and turned out a monster that became a national hit once it was circulated later in the decade on HBO, this movie never gets over being a tepid retread.<br /><br />What disturbed me most in this bad remake is the collective portrayal of the female roles. In the 1976 original, there was only one woman in the cast, a secretary in the police station. This one reprised that role, added a psychiatrist in a short dress, and a black female prisoner.<br /><br />While not bad in itself, what is unforgivable is these women were cast as the archetypal cliches of Hollywood films. Two of the women were extremely sexy and dressed in garb to accentuate their sexiness, while the black female was (of course) a streetwise prisoner declaring her innocence in rap rabble. Oh yes, she could hotwire a car too.<br /><br />Were the people that wrote, edited, produced and directed this film so unimaginative as to not take one risk with a female character? The answer is no and that is the endearing formula for this movie: remake the original with modern technique and take no risks to be different or better.<br /><br />A couple of the actors distinguished themselves within the context of this unimaginative film. Fishburne was, as always, a commanding screen presence, Leguizamo added a dimension to a cliched prisoner role, and de Matteo showed she can become someone other than Adrianna from "The Sopranos" and the other TV characters she has portrayed.<br /><br />But these performances were not sufficient to deny comparison between this and the original, a comparison where this film inevitably suffers badly. Your only chance to truly enjoy this movie is to never have seen nor heard of the original. If that's you, then go for it. But after you're done with this, go out and buy the original from Amazon.com and find out what can be achieved with this idea.</p></br></body></html>

Clooney is one of those actors who never really challenges himself but his role in this film is quite good and surprising. His love interest played by the very talented Vera Farmiga really adds depth and there's also a dramatic twist at the end that I never saw coming. Anna Kendrick is also good in this film, her character is very naive in the start but by the end, she becomes a more compassionate and well-rounded person. Up in the Air isn't a perfect film and it's slow in certain parts but overall, I enjoyed it very much!</p></br><a href="../users/AKMEY1BSHSDG7.html">AKMEY1BSHSDG7</a><br/><p>If you have any experience with a large corporation as of late, Up In The Air is a film that may make you squirm with emotional discomfort. The recognition of the cold, unresponsive attitude of upper management driven to have greater profits at the expense of a loyal work force seen only as "inventory" is almost too much to watch. Up In The Air is character driven, and the thin story is played out through those experiences.<br /><br />I both loved and hated this film. The knowledge that Clooney's charming and handsome portrayal of a corporate hatchet person was just that -- charming and handsome -- did nothing, for me, to soften the ultimate recognition that these positions are often filled by sociopaths who glory in the opportunity to damage others. Jason Bateman's cavalier approach to this business was perfection as he found new and more damaging ways to suck more profits from his trade.<br /><br />I could not help but view Up In The Air through a lens of current financial and corporate reality, and the experiences of friends and family around me. It's hard to believe that anyone could view it without being smacked in the face by the real pain suggested here. See this film, but only if you feel you could deal with renewing that pain in all of Hollywood's "glory."</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>I'd rather have George Clooney's life in this movie (I have no idea what his character's name is - I just think, "George Clooney!") where everything is expense account-ed plus he gets kickbacks in the form of accumulated miles for every dollar he is reimbursed for anyway.  Everything is done for him in terms of meals, washing dishes, laundry, changing the bed linens, washing the bathrooms (one hopes) and in flight coddling and free oreos in the executive class lounge.  Pretty good if you don't have true love and the desire for babies that true love brings.  Plus, George Clooney's job does not involve expertise except reading people's personal files and his ego-nourishing use of his personality to get over on total strangers.  The job itself sucks but how the job is packaged is great for certain personalities.  Not everyone who watches this movie is going to feel better about nesting in Nebraska or Wisconsin.  This is somewhat like Nicolas Cage's Family Man before Don Cheadle appears.  I think the remorse is projected by the audience.  George Clooney never meets his One in this film.  Anna Kendrick as Natalie is great but really undamaged and inexperienced in contrast to Vera Farmiga's character who could only survive encountering and interacting with someone like George Clooney if she didn't have a fallback situation. If I had been Natalie's age, I would have wanted to sign up to be Up in The Air.  I've heard a Dell rep in Hong Kong complain about five star hotels and business class fares but not everyone would have found it to be a hardship especially if they had no human relationships tying them down.  I could have done this job for decades and happily accumulated unspent income AND kickbacks.  It's a very busy ant stockpiling against the coming winter kind of employment - low expenses and creature comfort perks.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>My wife wanted to watch this film, so I rented it hoping for the best.  I have to say that I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected.  A romantic comedy/drama this film kept me entertained throughout.  Clooney as charming as ever plays a corporate hatchet man who is traveling 240+ days a year and loves it.  He is not close to his sisters and has no family of his own.  It is a really interesting character study and the surrounding cast is very strong.  Some parts are a little cheesey, but enough works that I can recommend the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>This movie did an amazing thing it took a fairly serious look at downsizing at a personal level at various companies, but it made me smile almost all the way through the movie. The movie took place in cities like Omaha, Des Moines, Milwaukee and Detroit. The movie didn't pull punches at the final interviews. I've been downsized and this felt real. These people were hurting in different ways. The laughable help the company provides for placement was just right. My manager gave me a help wanted page ad from the local paper for a job $40k less than my current salary and for which I wasn't really qualified. He must have spent a minute looking for it. However, the movie did not lambaste the companies. The companies were hurting too.  The movie did not take the obvious route in most of the movie. There were some nice twists.<br /><br />The actors were all good, but George Clooney was great. He exhibited just the right amount of charm and denial. He was going through a mid life crisis and there were no easy answers. He had the life he wanted, but realized it was empty. He daily job of firing people emphasized his own emptiness. Clooney's character was an inspirational speaker too. His speech was hilarious and scary. Some people think this way.<br /><br />Jason Bateman was good too. He played the boss, who was trying to run the company the best way he knew how, but basically was an insensitive jerk. Who else could come up with a company like this?<br /><br />I strongly recommend the movie. It has comedy, charm, and pathos. It is a great look at our society and what it values.</p></br><a href="../users/A1845IJB63D5H7.html">A1845IJB63D5H7</a><br/><p>The obscure business of the traveling millions of miles for the sake of firing employees left me uneasy. People get fired without such elaborate procedures. Repeating the scenarios of interviewing and firing, over and over, hints to the weakness and redundancy of the story. I enjoyed the aerial shots of cities and clouds from high in ski, but could not put up with the redundant and repetitive airport sceneries that serve no purpose other than killing movie time<br /><br />Though the movie deals with modern day business model, it succeeded in portraying the human feeling of those involved. The leathery face of a young and inexperienced executive, contrasted with the lively complexion of a seasoned executive, both were neatly contrasted with the feeble and vulnerable worn down employees. The two executives acting in their official capacities must work like vampires, cloaked under professionalism, to convey the bad news to the newly fired folks. Each of the two executive vampires will be again transformed to humans only when their romantic relationships crash as a result from their unsettling life-style.<br /><br />"Up in the air" is a great title when viewed on its most critical statement: "we take the most fragile people and set them adrift". Most of those set adrift were indeed too fragile to survive the jolt of unemployment. Here, the movie departed from showing what those people did wrong to deserve such destiny, while it focused on an irrelevant and unreasonable concern of a remotely located executive, watching the drama unfolding on his screen.<br /><br />Turning the table on those cold-blooded executives, the movie exposes the dryness of emotion that reflected on their personal lives. The most ambitious and brilliant young woman exited soon before losing her identity. The long-timer executive, after accumulating millions of travel miles, could not find true love when he thought he was in control. Neither the emptiness of soul helped the highly paid executive to relate to his closest relatives, nor did their unsettled life bring them to live real.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>Although I was cool to director Jason Reitman's first two films, "Thank You for Smoking" and "Juno", this dramedy signaled his maturity in the ranks of the top directors of today like Scorsese, Katherine Bigelow(The Hurt Locker)or James Cameron (Titanic, Avatar). For one starters, it has a smart well written script and a top notch performance by George Clooney which will certainly earn him and Reitman Oscar nods. Plus the supporting characters are also well drawn out and performed to perfection by Anne Kendricks, Vera Farmiga, J.K. Simmons and Danny McBride. I won't go to much into the plot except to say it is about the rude awakening of a man who's been "up in the air" far too long to recognize his own humanity.

This is all very nice, of course, and it fooled a lot of critics that haven't seen many movies into believing it was unique to this film even though Frederick March played the role more wisely and with greater commitment in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009NZ2OW">The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit</a> more than a half-century ago.<br /><br />Still, there is plenty to like about "Up In the Air," not least of which is Clooney's characterization of a corporate head chopper -- the opposite of what used to be called a headhunter (someone that recruits candidates for open jobs.) In this role, Clooney plays the head chopper -- someone that goes around and tells people they are fired. The script says Clooney does this, "because companies are too chicken s--t to do it themselves."<br /><br />That's disingenuous, of course. My wife was canned by a Fortune 500 corporation directly, not through a head chopper. She was called to personnel at 3 p.m. one day, told her job was eliminated and she was not being offered another in the company, that someone would get her coat, she should leave the building accompanied by company guards, and her personal belongings would be mailed to her.<br /><br />In "Up In the Air," once Clooney delivers the bad news, people were allowed to hang around their office the rest of the day. In real life, people would tear up the place, spew virtriol to their soon-to-be ex-coworkers, and use their computers to download viruses to wreck their company's operating system under such circumstances. But, I recall saying there were things to like about this movie...<br /><br />Those include the film's second subject, Clooney's romance with another head chopper played by  Vera Farmiga (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M341QE">The Departed</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OU5NLW">Quid Pro Quo</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000D9PNS">Love in the Time of Money</a>), who plays his female alter ego. In one scene they compare their travel and hospitality cards, a sad view into their lonely and empty lives spent on the road, in hotels, and in coporate backrooms telling people their careers are either dead, dying, or on life support, but a scene that seems on the surface to be one of happiness and fulfillment.<br /><br />The pair have an affair, of course, and, in a later incomprehensibly dumb sequence at Clooney's sister's wedding -- where he takes the object of his affair as a date -- Clooney's life objective suddenly turns 180 degrees. He then bolts, revolts, tries to relent, and calls on Farmiga to be his soulmate. This episode is full of heartbreak and predictability, but so is much of the movie.<br /><br />The main attraction of "Up In the Air" is the starry and beautiful leads, the breezy script that moves quickly from scene to scene, and the scenes where Clooney and Farmiga interact. Take away these elements and you have a fairly bland film about some aspects of corporate life in the post-2008 stock, auto, financial and employment markets' meltdown and its affect on the employees of those industries.<br /><br />Just as Michael Douglas played the angry American who lost his job in the 1991-92 recession in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790742780">Falling Down</a>, George Clooney here represents the decaying infrastructure of America's coporations in the post-meltdown era. The fact that there's a love story and some beautiful people in this flick, and a fast script, is what keeps you from thinking about the reality of the situation. If you want to do that, watch Michael Moore's comedy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030Y11XS">Capitalism: A Love Story</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/APBB297H3ZA5E.html">APBB297H3ZA5E</a><br/><p>1.  I'm neutral on George Clooney and definitely on the romantic comedy genre and thus wasn't expecting much from this movie.  However, I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie.  However it's advertised as, this movie really defies categorization: it's very intelligently made, excellent writing, excellent acting, it's about relationships but not really a romantic comedy, but it's not an overtly deep and philosophical movie as well... It's really a movie about life.<br /><br />2.  Thank goodness there are folks out there who still make movies the old fashion way--> good writing + good acting.  Well done and highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>Ryan Bingham's (Clooney) a hired gun--he literally flies all around the world firing people for big companies without the cajones to do it themselves.  While he's redirecting the newly fired employees' anger to finding their new goals, he's on his way to his life's goal--10 million frequent flier miles--when Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) literally grounds him.  Her brilliant and economical idea:  use teleconferencing to fire people.<br /><br />But first, Ryan's got to teach Natalie the ropes so she can design the program. The two of them go out on the road where Natalie learns such things as how to accumulate miles and which travelers to get behind to get through the lines faster.<br /><br />In this case both have a lot to learn from each other.  Natalie loses her love and Ryan thinks he's found his with Alex (Vera Farmiga). The story's poignant and painful and truly one of Clooney's best roles.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, December 2009</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Jason Reitman (director and co-writer with Sheldon Turner based on Walter Kirn's novel of the same name)  is a bright light among the new directors of important stature.  He has a style: he makes comedy films touching on serious matters (JUNO deals with teen pregnancy, THANK YOU FOR SMOKING deals with the dangers of tobacco); his films open with significant and elaborate sequences; his main characters offer highly subjective narrations and tend to be self-confident people who end up re-thinking their lives; he tends to favor continued using of a troupe of ensemble actors (here JK Simmons, Sam Elliott, James Bateman).  UP IN THE AIR shares all of these traits and more.  It dares to talk about firing people in a time when everyone in this country is frightened about the job market and somehow manages to show the compassion for both the victims and the perpetrators. It is a challenge of the first order and Reitman makes it work very well.  This is not a feel good comedy; this is a drama with comic relief that addresses serious issues and people's responses to them - employment, relationships, marriage, and apparent self-sufficiency.<br /><br />Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) spends his time in the air, flying to companies across the USA whose CEOs don't want the job of informing employees they are no longer needed.  Ryan manages to make these encounters as human as possible and he is an artist in his work. His personal life is rather arid: his love needs are met by women on the run, he has distanced himself from his family, electing to maintain a sterile one room apartment in Omaha which he uses the few days out of the year when he is not flying. He meets a very beautiful, smart, and seductive woman Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) and a crazy courtship ensues as they meet in different cities  - both being traveling business people.<br /><br />Things change when Ryan's boss Craig (Jason Bateman) takes on a fresh graduate student with big ideas for reducing the costs of the company.  Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) is smart, a focused designer of telecommunications who has sold Craig on the idea of doing the firing remotely rather than spending the money to fly Ryan et al around the country. Ryan bristles and demands that Natalie accompany him on his personalized interview firings before the company goes Skype.  The two - Ryan and Natalie - are paired for an excursion of real life jobs terminations and both learn from each other.  Ryan continues to have trysts with Alex and eventually Ryan, Alex and Natalie party together.  Natalie discovers the human side of Ryan's work and finds the person to person contact difficult.  At the same time Natalie challenges Ryan's inability to form realistic relationships with women.  Hurtful things happen to each to the three fliers, causing each to re-think their career goals as well as their personal needs.<br /><br />Clooney, Farmiga, and Kendrick deliver first class performances (very obviously Oscar worthy), but then so do the many cameo actors in the film: Amy Morton, Melanie Lynsky and Danny McBride as Ryan's needy family, and a long list of very brief but deeply moving cameos of people being fired by an extraordinary group of actors (casting director Mindy Marin deserves an Oscar also).  The gorgeous cinematography is by Eric Steelberg and the music score is by Rolfe Kent (with a special nod to the composer and singer and guitar player who ends the movie credits with a song that summarizes the ideas of the film).  And shining over all of these factors is the superlative, flawless direction of Jason Reitman.  This film may have unpopular themes, but it is most assuredly on of the best films of 2009.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, February 10</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>A very strange film that proposes no way out in the crisis situation which is part of everyday life in the USA: firing and getting fired. Today quite a few businesses have outsourced the processing of these firing procedures. So a business specialized in firing people comes into the picture to do it properly, to make limbos presentable and hell palatable, heaven-like if you want, with some nice words and a lot of mind manipulation.<br /><br />These professional firers are plane people who can fly nearly 320 days a year and spend exactly 7 times 24 hours boarding planes in one year. They have very strict requirements about traveling light and traveling on light and flexible wheels. Home is airports all over the USA, some day all over the world. And they learn how to live with light sushi, and accepting or refusing a "cancer" when the stewardess proposes them "a can, sir".<br /><br />They thus learn how to wrap up horror and death on a slow fire and so many other evils in the shiny suits of rebirth, a new beginning, an opportunity to excel in a new field of creativity. They forget the suffering they are going to create or even the death they are peddling day after day, be it jumping from a bridge, or slow poisoning on alcohol, or just triggering some fire arm.<br /><br />But on the other side the younger ones out of Cornell University or some other high-rise higher education schools are just developing a new technique based on the Internet and communication tools and technologies to dehumanize firing by making direct contact, even be it only eye contact, impossible since two screens, two cameras, two mikes, two modems and a telephone line are between the firer and the firee. That's what  they are told and taught in these deluxe schools that can wrap any crap in gold to make us think it is a nugget or a piece of chocolate.<br /><br />But Clooney brings another dimension in his airport ever perambulating home: that is to say just not being alone. Of course in those terminals and in those planes you can always find some human contact, be it purely professional and paid for, or be it some person casually met in a bar or restaurant, or for the more deprived be it only a chambermaid, or as for that a chamber-"valet" or plain janitor. But he shows us how at one moment in this life the traveler will want some more permanent or regular contact and meeting. But that is nothing but an appearance meeting an appearance and hell it is for the one who believes this appearance, on this side or on the other side, is the real thing. Harder will the fall be, and harder is the fall.<br /><br />A small film showing the total artificiality and somewhere absurdity of that civilization based on transience and mobility and rootless-ness and professional distance and non-empathy. Cruel but absurd. Samuel Beckett at its highest acme.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>In a time when our world changing far too quickly, there is always a film that comes along to define the sign of the times. This time George Clooney takes us into the mind of a man who just flat out hates being around people and involved with their lives. Guess what he does for a living? He has to fire people from their jobs and connect with them in order to motivate them to find a new opportunity.  So now what do you do when your line of work is telling you have to stop avoiding all connections and stay grounded? That is what the film `Up In The Air' is all about.<br /><br />I knew that there was a huge buzz about this movie and I have to say I got a lot more than I expected out of this movie. First of all the cast is crazy amazing. Everyone from Clooney to Kendrick plays their roles unbelievably well. Anna Kendrick was of course my favorite, just because I was in her exact position not too long ago. I remember learning the tricks of the trade in my line of work and traveling to sit down with prospects. I remember sitting in a car almost crying because I found the job to be too much or just wondering if I was going to able to do this on my own for a living. What I loved about the film the most was how it depicted how distant we are becoming as a creature. How we break up with our significant others over a text message or that we can't sit face to face in the room with someone when we have to give them negative news. It shows that it turns us into soulless and spineless people. Whether you would agree with my views or not...that was what I got out of this film. Understand that this film can depress you at points, but it is a comedy and it has some great laughable moments and yes you do get a nice ending.<br /><br />This is a movie that I recommend you see at least once, because it just a story about ordinary people trying to live the lives they want to live. That is something we as individuals do every day. The question is what makes you stand out amongst the others.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>Jason Reitman, like his famous father, is able to take even the most preposterous setup and turn it into an entertaining film with a keen eye for the human condition.  Ryan (George Clooney's character) flies about the country working for a firm that fires people.  This is somewhat of a gimmick - Reitman even filmed actual employees who had been downsized, asking them to re-enact their behavior when they were fired (or even to act as they "in hindsight wished they would have acted"), and there are some genuinely noble and passionate observations to be made in these scenes.  In a lesser movie, Ryan would merely serve as the witness to their tragedies.  Instead, we are invited into the world of transients that Ryan inhabits - one of airports, 2-hour friendships with the guy sitting next to you on the flight - and Ryan's sharp observations on the fundamental isolation of human beings give us the first layer of the film.<br /><br />The second layer is provided by the three women in Ryan's life - the woman next door with whom he has a "neighbours with privileges" arrangement, a fellow frequent flyer with whom he has "frequent flyer privileges," and a young new co-worker who is trying to make his job obsolete.  I'm sure the first woman would not even be mentioned in most reviews, but her part, albeit small, is critical to the plot.  When Ryan comes home (to a souless apartment he sleeps in only 50 days of the year) his neighbour pops by for a chat.  It's clear that they have been sexual partners, but Ryan immediately back off when she tells him she's "seeing somebody now."  This is what establishes our sympathy for Ryan - he is essentially moral, unlike the sleazy bosses he is surrogate for.<br /><br />That leaves the other two women free to serve as Ryan's antagonists.  Alex is a fellow frequent-flyer and business woman with whom he has an explicit agreement to meet up with for sex whenever their travel schedules overlap.  She states at the outset that she is just as independent and shackle-free as Ryan, but implies otherwise in numerous conversations that follow.  The unfortunately named Natalie Keener is the keen new co-worker aiming to revolutionize the business by eliminating the need to travel and enabling her and Ryan's company to save millions in airfare.  That this would destroy Ryan's way of life immediately sets him against her, but he smartly frames it as a professional discussion about how badly the company would fare if they became just another cheap hatchet-job operation.  Natalie sets off with Ryan to see "how the job is done," and the three of them (Ryan, Natalie, and Alex) form a kind of triumvirate trolling the airport hotels.  Their conversations on life, love, and commitment form the actual heart of the movie - Ryan cynically independent, Natalie the the traditional romantic (talking and texting her boyfriend every night, having rejected offers from the most prestigious law firms in the big city to follow him to his new job in Kansas), and Alex occupying the middle ground as a sort of mediator.<br /><br />We are now at the 2/3 mark of the film and all is well.  Unfortunately, either from studio pressure or through some sort of internal need for closure, Reitman allows the film to drift off into a more standard cookie-cutter resolution.  I'm okay with the fact that Natalie is given a closed story-arc because her character is designed for that purpose.  I'm okay that Ryan shows her up in a great scene of redemption where he notices something about the man he's firing that allows him to give the fired man hope and promise for a more satisfying life.  Again, I can forgive this scene as it is so well acted and contains such humanity (and because the fired man is played by Reitman's good-luck charm J.K. Simmons).  What I can't forgive is the whole-hearted and sudden transformation of Ryan from lone wolf to den-mother and the resolution of his relationship with Alex.  It's not so much the resolution itself, but the fact that the relationship was resolved that left me unsatisfied.  It's almost like it came from a different, more conventional movie, and it discolours all the events preceding it in such a way that it even spoils the film's re-watchability.  I wish Reitman would have taken a note from Sophia Coppola's playbook - we don't hear what Bill Murray's character says at the end of "Lost in Translation" because it would ruin the rest of the film (no matter what was actually said).<br /><br />So we're left with a film that is excellent for about 3/4 of the time.  The good news is that most films are never good, and I'm thankful for those 3/4.  So I rate this film a 4/5 mainly because it let me down at the end with what I consider to be an artificial resolution.  For those buying the DVD, the director's commentary is actually fairly entertaining, and shows Reitman to be a thoughtful and interesting filmaker, and I look forward to his next project.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>Nominated for 6 Academy Awards, this 2009 film is as timely as today's headlines (or I should say last year's headlines).  It's set in the turbulent times of office layoffs during the recession. George Clooney is cast as the hatchet man and he really loves his job.  He travels all the time and doesn't even have his own apartment because he's always in the air.  He loves this life he leads which consists of airports, fancy hotels, and occasional one night stands. We see him in an amorous adventure with Vera Farmiga.  She's also a high-powered executive who flies all the time and they meet for torrid couplings whenever they can. Suddenly things change.  Technology has entered the business and his boss wants to make these formerly face-to-face firings through computer screens. He's hired a hotshot aggressive young woman, Anna Kendrick, to manage this.  Clooney complains against this but his boss sends the young woman on a trip with him to test out this new system.<br /><br />Naturally they are complications.  Some of them are the sad responses of the people being fired.  Another is how the presence of this young woman effects the relationship between Clooney and Famrmiga.  Some of this is outrageously funny and I found myself laughing out loud.  And other parts brought tears to my eyes as the people being fired watched their lives collapse.  And then there is Clooney's family, who is hosting a wedding for his niece.<br /><br />All of this seemed very real.  The film moves fast and includes trials and tribulations as well s some high comic moments.  And then, just when I thought I knew how the film would end, there was a real surprise zinger which changed everything.<br /><br />This is a really fine film.

He is away on the road for about 322 days of the year working for a company that is hired to tell people that they have lost their jobs and helping them with the transition. Such is his isolation that he does not believe in marriage or love and is becoming alienated from his family of siblings. He is also a motivational speaker who travels on various speaking engagements and goads people to consider what is important to them. Life is smooth for the solitary man. Until.....<br />He meets Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) who is road warrior like him. They meet and both become attracted to each other. On the professional front, Bingham's company has just hired a grad school rookie who wants to embark on some cost cutting and do the work of firing people by teleconferencing. Ryan realizes that his dream of attaining a million frequent flier miles will be broken, so he takes this upstart Natalie on a cross country jaunt to teach her the ropes with the intention of showing her that firing people in person is better than through the internet.

Throw in spunky new sidekick Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), who sets out to change the way he does business, and Bingham is forced to re-evaluate all of life's priorities.<br /><br />What really makes this film work is, much like Gran Torino, the unbiased nature of the storytelling (making it the exact opposite of a film like Avatar).  Viewers are treated to two completely different sorts of life (both on the road and settling down at home) with all the pros and cons included, and must (through Bingham) come to their own conclusion about which life is more satisfactory.<br /><br />The acting is also terrific, with Clooney doing what he's done for years and finding a good thespian match in Farmiga.  However, it truly is young Kendrick who nearly steals the show with her energetic performance.  Her character superbly represents the thoughts and feelings going through the heads/hearts of the viewers, questioning Bingham on nearly ever decision he makes.  I don't say this too often about young people in the film business, but the sky is the limit for this woman based on this incredible performance.<br /><br />Finally, a little anecdote about why this movie may touch you as it did me:<br /><br />When I was five years old, my father played a little trick on me.  He said he had a "magic pill" (a common vitamin, of course!) that would make me stay "five forever", allowing me to go to school and play with my toys ad infinitum.  I took the bait hook, line, and sinker, but only after swallowing the pill were the consequences brought to my attention, such as seeing all my little friends grow up, always having to take naps, etc.  After a bit of contemplation, I then chose the "antidote" to set things right again.<br /><br />Filmmaker Jason Reitman operates under the same concept with "Up in the Air".  We are first given a glance into the seemingly wonderful life of the man on the road, but only upon deeper introspection do we discover the true nature of his often lonely existence.  What makes things interesting, of course, is the fact that his decision is much more meaningful than from some five year old.<br /><br />Thus, I strongly recommend this to film fans of any and all kinds for its deep story and incredible acting.  If, say, Avatar turned you off by its overly black-and-white themes, this is the antithesis.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UNMXBJSVIXFB.html">A2UNMXBJSVIXFB</a><br/><p>Movie - 5.0<br /><br />It's really strange how a lot of my college classes in the past year have coincided with movies I end up watching. Right now, I'm taking a course on Civic Engagement & The Power of Social Capital, then another on Business Anthropology. Civic Engagement basically teaches us that society as a whole isn't what it used to be; people are more isolated these days, technology has made us inexplicably more distant from one another, and there just isn't much of a human connection anymore, at least like there used to be in generations past. Business Anthropology is about the concepts of change and difference and how things (be they in life or the business world) are always evolving and need to adapt over time. Enter: Up in the Air, an incredibly accurate testament and indicative measure of the times we're currently living in and the complications that come with it. It's a story about how we choose to live our lives and is backed by a very clever analogy in "The Empty Backpack." Of all the material things we own and all the people we know and the baggage that comes with those relationships, do we really need to weigh ourselves down with that? Our dead-end jobs, friends, and family; is there really a point to having all of these and keeping them close outside of what cultural norms tell us we need? On the other hand, if we didn't engage with one another and actually socialize from time to time, humanity certainly wouldn't be as welcoming and we all probably wouldn't have those friends and family to share some of the happier moments with. I think this movie does a brilliant job with its script and screenplay showing both the benefits and hindrances of choosing between the two lifestyles. Until this semester, I would actually say I was somewhere in-between, but leaning closer to the loner side. However, with these classes and now the viewing of this fine movie, I'd say I'm stuck back in the middle again, but with no real preference. Moderation and balance are always a good thing, right? And with that said, kudos to Jason Reitman for a very poignant film and to George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, and Anna Kendrick for some outstanding performances. Up in the Air may not be everyone's cup of tea, but for those interested in a "ground-based" (there's an oxymoron), slice-of-life drama, that's also a great psychological and character study about how society works, this is definitely worth a watch.<br /><br />Video - 5.0<br /><br />Brought to you by Paramount in 1080p via the MPEG-4 AVC codec at an original aspect ratio of 1.85:1, Up in the Air is as perfect a picture as you will find. Colors are vibrant from the very beginning of the opening credits sequence and throughout the entire movie, separating clothes, backgrounds, skin tones, hair, lighting, etc. Detail and textures are also very distinct between people and objects, most notably for me between George Clooney and the many suits he wears and the patterns on both his and everyone else's business attire. Black levels are deep, though not amazingly so given there are very few instances of pure pitch blackness. Contrast is also excellent and compliments the fine layer of grain for a remarkably theatrical feel. There are also zero instances of artifacting, debris, and image manipulation. It's not reference material in the sense of wowing your guests, but flawless is still flawless.<br /><br />Audio - 4.5<br /><br />Some may find it odd to give a dialogue-driven character drama a 4.5 for audio, but even with its limited sound design, this DTS-HD track is surprisingly ample. Dialogue is clear with no dropout or volume issues, and what few ambient sound effects there are resonate accordingly from the front and side speakers. But the star of the audio is the music, which really supports the film as a whole emanating profusely from all speakers and creating a subtle, if not melancholy, mood to help convey the story. The only element obviously lacking, though, are any real levels of LFE output. There's one scene during a party that makes for some great bass in the on-screen music, but that's it.<br /><br />Extras - 2.0<br /><br />Armed with only a commentary track (a pretty good one) and deleted scenes (in HD, and also with good commentary), Up in the Air doesn't have much else aside from a couple of features about how they constructed the opening sequence and a storyboard comparison. I would really liked to have seen interviews from the rest of the staff, the author of the original book, or cast members about there thoughts on the film itself, but perhaps they thought the film wouldn't be as well-received enough, and hence, decided not to go through the trouble? That's a shame.<br /><br />Overall - 4.0<br /><br />While the extras are severely lacking, I'd still highly recommend this film for its outstanding story and A/V presentation. It's a story that I, personally, find very enduring and enjoyable thanks in part to its eloquent message about isolation, the benefits of companionship, the deteriorating affinity we have with one another, the impact of change, and just how important it is to see both sides of the coin when it comes to life. With outstanding direction and writing from Reitman, a subtle, yet fun script, exceptional performances by veterans Clooney and Farmiga, and a prominent job by Kendrick (who shows a lot of potential), Up in the Air is one of the finest character dramas I've seen in a while and should be one of the things you keep in your proverbial backpack.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>UP IN THE AIR is one of those small, quiet films that builds up impact, and then hits you over the heart with everything it's got.  The film follows Ryan Bingham (no relation to the country singer/composer of CRAZY HEART, by the way) as he flies across the nation firing people.  Ryan doesn't care much for love and marriage (despite his kid sister's upcoming wedding), but he falls hard for Alex, another frequent-flier.  The biggest thing in Ryan's life is his job; but that's all about to change.<br /><br />Okay, the plot for UP IN THE AIR sounds rather tedious.  And, in lesser hands, it would be.  The film isn't a romantic comedy; nor is it a serious contemplation on the redemptive/destructive power of love.  It's a commentary on the current economic status (most of the people getting fired in this film are non-actors reliving the moment they lost their job); and yet it never takes itself too seriously.  It features stellar chemistry from the two leads (George Clooney and Vera Farmiga, both deserving their Oscar nods and more), as well as strong support from Anna Kendrick (also deserving that Oscar nod), Jason Bateman, and cameos from J.K. Simmons, Sam Eliot, Danny McBride, Zack Galifianakis.  The directing (courtesy of Jason Reitman, surpassing his previous films JUNO and even THANK YOU FOR SMOKING) is top-notch, and the script is stellar; if the film has any flaw, it's that it comes off as a bit over-polished.  And yet, with such a likable and enigmatic cast (boldly led by Clooney at his finest), this film also feels organic and natural.  UP IN THE AIR is proof that serious filmmaking still exists in Hollywood.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>It seems a bit strange, even sacrilegious to say that a film about people losing their jobs is a great film, funny and moving. But "Up In The Air", the new film from writer - director Jason Reitman ("Juno", "Thank You For Smoking") is a very good (great?) film deftly mixing comedy, funny and dark, with real human emotions and familiar situations. Starring George Clooney," Air" is a film to watch when the Awards season begins.<br /><br />Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) plays a man who lives on airplanes; Ryan works for a company who hires him out to travel around the country and fire people who are being laid off. Basically, he does the dirty work for people who are too afraid to do it themselves. He spends so much time in airports, on airplanes, and in chain hotels, these have become his new home. He prefers these places to his actual apartment in Omaha and dreads returning there. He also has a goal. He wants to earn a coveted award from his airline of choice for flying more than a million miles. Then, his boss (Jason Bateman) tells him they have just hired a new college graduate, Natalie (Anna Kendrick, "Twilight") who has come up with a revolutionary way for them to do their job, through teleconferencing. But before they implement this plan, he wants Natalie to travel with Ryan, to learn the ropes. Ryan meets another fellow traveler, Alex (Vera Farmiga) who seems equally at home in airports and hotels. They hook up and realize they want to meet as often as possible. Both of these women begin to change the way Ryan thinks. But is it too late for him to change his life?<br /><br />It is almost amazing how accomplished and interesting the short career of director Jason Reitman has been. Sure, he is the son of mega-director Ivan (of "Ghostbusters" fame), but Jason's films have shown a remarkable amount of talent, skill and thought. His first film, "Thank You For Smoking" is a scathing, very funny satire about lobbyists. His second, "Juno", propelled Ellen Page to stardom and earned some Awards buzz. Now, with "Up In The Air", the director has created his most accomplished, introspective, meaningful and interesting film yet. "Air" is sure to be a contender for many awards in the next few months.<br /><br />Reitman's "Air" is the story of a man who travels across country and fires people for a living. And because of this, Ryan Bingham is basically an unlikable guy, which isn't a bad thing at all, but it is a strange thing to find in a major studio release. And a lot of credit for our interest in watching Ryan's journey has to go to Clooney. We get a feeling for Bingham, who he is, what he is, why he is, all of which is illustrated very succinctly in a voice over from Ryan. Ryan seems to revel in the world he has created for himself. Always on the move, always in another airplane, another hotel room. At one point, Ryan swipes a frequent customer card and announces to us the employee is programmed to great him in a specific way. The way Ryan (and Clooney) tells us about this barely hides the frequent flyer's pleasure at having reached such a lofty level of business with this other corporation. While this reveals a lot about Ryan's business dealings to us, it also shows a lot about his character. He seems to revel in the fact that some anonymous woman, who could care less about him (and vice versa) has to greet him in a specific way. This is what constitutes a relationship in his world and he is all the happier for it. And of course, we can see how shallow and empty his world is, so we feel more than a little empathy for him. All of these feelings come flooding through us even as we begin to have opposite feelings towards him, because we can't forget he goes around firing people, taking their livelihood from them.<br /><br />But as soon as these conflicts start to stir within us, they quickly disappear. We start to like Ryan and care for him. If he didn't do this job, someone else would. And he doesn't seem to revel in the actual details of the job; he seems to try to be as empathetic to the people around him as possible. Someone else would probably be less kind to the unfortunate souls.<br /><br />Clooney's performance seems effortless and this makes Ryan seem all the more viable a person. And because of this, I have no doubt he will be nominated for a slew of awards in the next few weeks.<br /><br />Wisely, Reitman does a very interesting thing to help make Ryan all the more human. Ryan's boss (Jason Bateman) introduces Natalie (Anna Kendrick "New Moon", "Twilight") as a new hotshot college graduate with some great ideas. And soon, the idea is revealed. If they start to do their job through teleconferencing, the company will save a lot of money on airfare, hotels, etc. This will effectively ground Ryan, causing him to panic slightly. But he also realizes physically sitting in front of someone they are firing helps the situation. Sure, it is a crappy situation to begin with, but firing people long distance isn't going to help an already bad situation get any better. This is illustrated when they give the new system a trial run.<br /><br />In a way, they make Natalie even worse than Ryan and this helps to make Ryan more likable.<br /><br />Natalie and Ryan take a road trip together, to give Natalie some real world experience before the company fully adopts her plan. This trip becomes a growing experience for the recent college grad as Ryan tries to impart everything he has learned to her.<br /><br />One night, Ryan meets Alex (Vera Farmiga) at the hotel he is staying at. They have dinner, drinks and start to flirt over who has better Executive Rewards Cards. Ryan recognizes a kindred spirit and they really get along well, so they start to try to plan their schedules around when they can hook up together. The more they see each other, the more attracted they become and Ryan begins to question his existence, everything he has set-up for his life.<br /><br />The more we see and live with Ryan, the more we grow to like him, the more we grow to accept him.<br /><br />Reitman also uses a bunch of actual people who were recently fired as the victims of Ryan and Natalie's work. This gives the entire film a greater resonance and makes it seem more personal. Each of the real people reportedly gives the same response they gave when they were actually fired. These people are presented in a couple of quick montages giving us an overview of what Ryan does everyday, how many people he has to deal with, how many negative reactions and what has led him to become slightly numb but also horrified at Natalie's new plans.<br /><br />This sums up what makes "Up In The Air" so successful. Most of the things in the film, the characters, the story, their actions, the places they go, have at least two sides. Reitman and his cast and crew show us both, and this helps make everything more interesting and real.<br /><br />If you haven't already seen it, go!</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />With the plague of 'corporate downsizing' now reaching its zenith, such a social phenomenon is bound to come to the attention of Hollywood's top name producers. Hence, Jason Reitman, son of famous Hollywood producer/director Ivan Reitman, has been given the reins to address this very issue. It also helps to have heart-throb George Clooney in the role of corporate down-sizer Ryan Bingham, who flies around the country as a sort of 'hired gun', informing various downsized employees that their services are no longer required.<br /><br />Soon a young upstart, Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), comes up with the brilliant idea of firing employees via a computer video linkup. One wonders why Ryan's company hadn't embraced this method years before, since obviously it is much more cost effective. And it's also hard to believe that a new employee such as Natalie, who is just out of school, would be the one introducing the new prototype as these video linkups (as just pointed out) have not only been around for quite some time but it's more likely a more experienced person would probably be responsible for developing or customizing it.<br /><br />Somehow Ryan convinces his boss that 'face-to-face' firings still are much more preferable to firings via computer and that Natalie needs to understand the value of the 'human touch'. Ryan's boss puts the video project on hold and allows Ryan to keep jetting about firing people in person as long as Natalie accompanies him. This of course allows 'Up in the Air' to become something of a 'buddy' picture with Ryan and Natalie 'duking it out' over the nature of relationships. When Natalie finds out that Ryan has been having a casual affair with Alex, who is he is constantly meeting up with while on the road, she castigates him for not getting involved. Let me add that Natalie only becomes emotional over this issue after she has been dumped by her own boyfriend (via text message). For the most part, she is a one-note cold fish who soon learns the delicate art of firing people face to face, under Ryan's tutelage.<br /><br />Not much happens during the 'second act' of 'Up in the Air'. Director Reitman spends too much time presenting cameos of real-life people recreating their reactions to the news that they've been downsized. Was it necessary to 'pad' the film with these cameos? Basically one minute of the fired employees would have been enough to convey the despair of these hapless people. There are additional repetitious scenes with Ryan, while moonlighting as a motivational speaker, utilizing a backpack to illustrate his 'life philosophy' to an audience of self-help junkies at various hotel conference rooms. Reitman wastes additional time with a scene where the three principals attend a corporate party, culminating with a 'heart-to-heart' talk between Alex and Ryan on a corporate yacht.<br /><br />You would think that the big 'Act Two Climax' would have something to do with the relationship between Ryan, Alex and Natalie, but it doesn't. Instead, there's an awkward subplot that pops up involving Ryan's sister's fianc&eacute; who gets cold feet just before he's about to get married. Ryan is called in by his other sister and uses his 'motivational speaker' skills to convince the errant husband-to-be, to go ahead with the wedding--which of course he does and the couple live happily ever after.<br /><br />The wrap up of Act Three is decidedly a downer--and thoroughly unconvincing to boot. Despite the fact that Alex attends Ryan's sister's wedding and seemingly is now ready to become more involved with him, it just doesn't turn out that way. After giving up his motivational speaker gig, Ryan somehow finds Alex's home address and knocks on her door--only to discover that she is a married woman. Since Alex only wanted a casual relationship, it would have been much easier for her to simply tell Ryan that she was married and there would have been no hard feelings. But since the film's screenwriter was desperate to create some kind of drama (and there is so little of it in this film), we're treated to the unlikely scenario of Ryan being deflated when he discovers the true nature of Alex's marital status. As for Natalie, she quits the company after learning that one of the downsized employees that she had fired, killed herself. It appears that both Ryan and Natalie did not heed this particular employee's pronouncement while on one of their firing jaunts, as the woman did indeed explicitly state that she was going to jump off a bridge. Inexplicably, Ryan's boss puts the computer video link program on hold despite the fact that the communication between Ryan and Natalie and this particular employee, took place face to face!<br /><br />Up in the Air is a slow-moving 'dramedy' with an underdeveloped plot. While it's a very nice-looking film, the actors can do very little with their parts due to the weak script. Clooney basically plays himself (as he usually does) and offers up an only serviceable performance. On the basis of director Reitman's last two films ('Juno' preceded 'Up in the Air'), it's likely we'll be seeing uninspired, mediocre films from him in the future.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>You know those films that think they are so smart; the ones that brow beat you with their `message' but wind up blowing a lot of hot air for nothing, because they don't even know how to make their message come across as anything truly substantial?<br /><br />`Up in the Air' is one of those films.<br /><br />The basic premise behind `Up in the Air' is that of Ryan Bingham, a loner of sorts who ruins peoples lives for a living.  He is hired out by cowardly bosses to fire their employees.  He spends his life segregated from society and works his hardest to avoid any form of commitment, going as far to do motivational speaking where he instructs others on how to remove commitment from their lives (empty the backpack).  When Bingham's company sets in motion a change that will ground Bingham (who travels around the US to fire people) and forces him to fire individuals via internet conference, he starts to panic.  His self centered tendencies kick in, in the guise of mock concern for the people on the other end, and he finds himself traveling with a young business woman who is pimping the new system in order to `show her how it's done' so-to-speak.  Add to this an intoxicating woman named Alex who is just like Ryan, and you have a recipe for a mid-life crisis.<br /><br />Sadly, this films immature construction and poorly explored themes results in a mediocre attempt to capitalize on potential.<br /><br />I have a lot of minor issues here that culminate into one gigantic problem; the film is just too shallow, despite it's overabundance of overbearing `points'.<br /><br />Director Jason Reitman has a specific style to his direction that serves itself better suited for lighter fare and younger crowds.  His take on `Juno' in 2007 is an example of his talents better directed.  He created something fresh and sincere and in tone.  I even thought that his sarcastic touches on `Thank You For Smoking' were nicely placed and propelled the story (no matter how underdeveloped the film really was).  Sadly, his directorial approaches here are just out of place and distracting.  The film comes across like a poorly realized `television movie' thanks to the carefree effervescence he lends to each scene.  It is so airy and light and thus devoid of necessary weight.  The film seems to be trying to hard to be young, and it is not a `young' story.  The film also doesn't know how to make the most of the key scenes.  Take for instance Ryan's talk with his future brother-in-law.  It just seems so anticlimactic, especially for a scene that is designed to shed light on Ryan's personal shifts.  The script is just horrendously fleshed out.  The ending dives off the edge into an endless barrage of clich&eacute;s that try to (quickly) validate all the personality shifts in the central characters.  The endless finger pointing at Ryan's way of living was also a deterrent (not to mention that disgusting abuse of narration).  It was like Reitman thought his audience was too stupid to draw the right conclusion about Ryan's character and so he felt it necessary to remind us at every opportunity that his life was all about solidarity and that no one else around him (outside of Alex) understood him; thus he is abnormal.<br /><br />But of course he's not strange; he's just confused...right?<br /><br />The acting was a saving grace, although I'll never understand the praise and accolades heaped upon Anna Kendrick, who was fine but far from noteworthy.  George Clooney was charming and sincere and likable despite his unlikable tendencies.  In other words; he was very comfortable playing himself and it showed.  Whatever.  Vera Farmiga though, was a triumph and I'm so glad she was recognized by Oscar.  What she does with Alex is beyond words amazing.  She actually creates a character who is well rounded, understandable and three dimensional.  When her character is truly uncovered you sense all the layers of this woman stripping away and it is gloriously handled with a simple stare.  Farmiga is a master actress and I'm so glad that this film gave her the chance to make her name better known.<br /><br />In the end I'm struggling with this one.  I mean, the whole `we are poignant because our current economic state is a mess' angle just didn't do it for me.  The ending collection of `confessions of the unemployed' was embarrassingly unnecessary.  It just felt like a lazy `tag on'.  The film isn't that invested in the idea that our current state of affairs is that relevant to Ryan's story.  This is a story about a man-child who needs to grow up.  Just because he happens to fire people for a living doesn't make his situation any different than 90% of all the other man-children depicted in cinema today.<br /><br />Yes, we all need to realize that a job doesn't make us but it is the people who surround our lives that make us who we are.  I get that.  Watch `Days and Clouds' for a film that really understands the weight this economy has on a person.  For `Up in the Air', the economic crisis is just a gimmick to attract unwarranted attention.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>Is it amusing? Yes. Is it entertaining? Yes. Is there a message at the end? Yes. But is it this amazing, fantastic, best movie of the year that everyone is saying it is? Not really.<br /><br />Is it the "feel-good" movie it claims to be on its packaging? No. See all those people smiling in the photos for this product page? Misleading. A big, fat lie. And that's a big clue as to what it knows about itself. It will not appeal to people who are looking for a feel-good comedy. You have to be prepared for "depressing". Nothing wrong with that, but I hate misleading packaging. At least it's nowhere near as dishonest as the packaging for "World's Greatest Dad."<br /><br />Sorry to rain on parades, but I thought fair warning is needed, after seeing all those glowing reviews. It's an OK movie, and you'll probably enjoy it (as much as such things can be enjoyed).</p></br><a href="../users/AW1493ZQTQ2ET.html">AW1493ZQTQ2ET</a><br/><p>This movie is different and interesting enough to be fairly engaging, so I had no problem staying focused from start to finish, and I often couldn't predict what would happen next (which is good).  And most broadly, the movie portrays the important lesson that, in our quest for meaningful lives, human relationships may be the best we can do.<br /><br />But I was bothered by a few things, so I have to drop my rating to 4 stars.  Most prominently, the main character Ryan strikes me as implausible: he's handsome, charismatic, can empathize with the people he lays off, and generally seems mature in many ways, yet he inexplicably goes to extremes to avoid close relationships; also, he likes to be pampered while traveling, yet he tolerates spending his relatively few days at home in a somewhat dumpy little place.  Similarly, I found it implausible to see how Alex, his female counterpart, was clearly sending him signs of romantic interest, yet in the end turned out to supposedly not be interested at all.  Likewise, I found the character of Natalie to be somewhat of a stereotyped cliche.  Last but certainly not least, I didn't find that the portrayal of the people being laid off effectively connected me with the distinct pain they must have felt at that moment.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, this is still a good movie overall, and many people will find it worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA.html">A3NH7PYU4AD5GA</a><br/><p>Meet the axe man, Ryan Bingham, played by G. Clooney. His job is telling people that they are `downsized', `let go', out of a job. (American business talk really is marvelously innovative.) He gets to do that because the people's bosses don't have the strength of character to tell them personally, but they have enough money to pay a consultant. Outsourcing is the magic word. This kind of game is played all over the US (this land is your land... is the appropriate film music), so Bingham lives in planes and airports and hotels and rented cars and has all priority cards in the industry. His ambition in life is to become a 10 million miles flyer.<br />Things get complicated when he, Clooney, gets threatened with being `let go' himself. Or rather, his job is made more cost efficient by cutting out the traveling and the face to face meeting in favor of video conferences. Bingham has moments of weakness and imagines that his accidental lover might want a real relationship. Bad idea.<br /><br />The film is certainly not hilariously funny, how could it be with its subject, but to a cynical observer of world affairs, like me, it seems to be a fairly accurate satire on certain aspects of capitalist life and reality. Quite a bitter satire, but not less true for the bitterness. I like the movie, but it is not a great one. A nice little one.<br /><br />I recognized so many facets of my own circle of experience that I could not help but enjoy it. My lifestyle has some similarities in terms of movement, though my job involves mainly hiring people, not firing them. That means that I am a better person than Bingham. I need that kind of reassurance for my mental balance, as Clooney definitely looks better. Truth must be told.<br />On the other hand, I have also been fired three times over the last 15 years, so I can relate to this film from different angles. So why not notch my rating up to 5 stars?<br /><br />P.S. the headline should read: Do you want a can, Sir?</p></br><a href="../users/ALLIGF5OZM1I6.html">ALLIGF5OZM1I6</a><br/><p>UP IN THE AIR<br /><br />STARRING: George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Danny McBride, Amy Morton, Melanie Lynskey, J.K. Simmons, Zach Galifianakis and Sam Elliot<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Jason Reitman and Sheldon Turner; based on the novel by Walter Kern<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Jason Reitman<br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Comedy<br />Release Date: 23 December 2009<br /><br />I wouldn't say George Clooney is one of the best actors as far as range is concerned; but he is a long way from the worst and is certainly one of the most likable. Clooney brings his own charisma to the screen that's nothing short of A-list status. It's his unique delivery and charming personality that makes him so enjoyable to watch and there is no shortage of either in the hilarious comedy, Up in the Air.<br /><br />Clooney plays Ryan Bingham; a guy who's more comfortable in a three piece suit than he would be in his pajamas or lounge-wear. He has fired so many people throughout his career that he can't remember the last time he actually hired someone.<br /><br />He is exceptional at this. He's a fire extinguisher to ruckuses and potential lawsuits. His company is so enthralled with his `tact' of letting people go, that they spend a small fortune sending him all over the country to do so, for other companies.<br /><br />It's because of this lifestyle that Ryan prefers being `up in the air' than down on the ground. `Up in the air' meaning the amount of time he spends flying to and from cities to fire people. There are perhaps half a dozen or more additional metaphors to be found in the title; one of the biggest being that his character lives `up in the air' instead of in reality with the rest of us.<br /><br />He has no wife, no kids, no pets and no friends. What little family he has, barely considers him relevant. His home is an absolute joke and is less appealing than the frequent hotels he spends more than two thirds of every year, living in. He has only his career and the occasional one night stand here and there; forming from a few cocktails at whatever hotel's bar he spends his evening at.<br /><br />It's at one of these said locations, that he meets his match, Alex; played delightfully by Vera Farmiga. Thank God someone has finally given her the Oscar nomination she has been so deserving of!<br /><br />Farmiga plays Alex to be every bit as pathetic as Ryan, in reference to their similar tastes and personalities. Naturally, neither of them wants any sort of a commitment. With all of that as un-satisfying as it may sound to the majority - Ryan couldn't be happier.<br /><br />His world is flipped upside down however, when his company grows weary of the financial strain that this brings to them each fiscal year. They hire an uptight young woman straight out of college, with her hair pulled back just a little too tight, to put a new plan in motion.<br /><br />The woman is 23-year-old Natalie Keener, played magnificently by Anna Kendrick. Her plan is to ground the twenty-something employees they fly around excessively to fire people. They will instead, do all of their terminating electronically via web-cam. Sounds thoughtful huh?<br /><br />Ryan is crushed to say the least. We get the sad-puppy-dog-Clooney face that we have all become familiar with, as he sits in his chair barely able to breathe during this little conference. Whatever will he do? What will his life become if he is to be stuck in the same location day in and day out? Ryan can't and won't let that happen.<br /><br />He challenges the youngster in front of their boss, played terrifically by Jason Bateman. Ryan outsmarts her, but in the end is put side by side with her to finish out the last few clients that are to be let go in person. This scene is very smartly written, well acted and hysterical, as was the entire film.<br /><br />In addition to enjoying his job to the fullest extent possible, Ryan's other goal is to reach a certain amount of frequent flyer miles. The number is so disgusting that I won't even share it with you. Should Ryan hit his target number, he will be awarded with a string of nuances, and will be among an elite single digit number of people to have done this, in the world.<br /><br />On their last few firing frenzies together, we learn a lot about Ryan and we learn a lot about Natalie and hopefully a thing or two about ourselves. They help each other with personal problems and character flaws, which are to be expected, but it's never predictable or corny. There are some very nice twists rolled into the second and third acts as well, including a major one, that I never saw coming.<br /><br />The film is full of laugh-out-loud moments that couldn't have been better written. The story moves along at 100 miles an hour and we are never bored even for a second. I've heard some people consider it to be a comedy / drama, and it does contain some dramatic elements; but it's very much a comedy, to me.<br /><br />Clooney definitely has some competition from the other nominees, in regards to taking home the Oscar, but we will see what happens. Up in the Air is well deserving of every single nomination it received and it could easily walk away with several of them.<br /><br />I liked writer / director Jason Reitman's first film Thank You for Smoking, I loved his second film Juno, and this was his best one yet. The man is severely talented and with these three perfect films under his belt, it's safe to say the sky is the limit for him. Don't worry I won't be overly cheesy and say that his success will bring him `Up in the air.' That would be too much.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>"Up In The Air" is a smug film. That doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad film but, considering it'd like to woo audiences into a kind of back-patting "smart" sentimentality, it certainly can't qualify as a great one.<br /><br />At virtually every key moment when he could draw the audience closer, director Jason Reitman pulls away for a zing, or to regard his actors, particularly George Clooney, from a pitying, judgmental distance. Exceedingly well-paced for most of its running time - and deft for all its moving parts - its flaws are exposed in the last 15 minutes, which drenches Clooney with one bucket of cold water after another as if to say "You see? Feel it!" There's something indecent about a comedy doing that, self-defeating. "Up In the Air" appears to resent its smile, which is to say it doesn't really have one.<br /><br />The premise veers toward satire without telegraphing its trajectory: Clooney is Ryan Bingham, a corporate samurai who fires people when companies don't feel like it. In the role, Ryan's a method actor, capably (and somewhat inexplicably) adjusting his persona to the newly axed sitting across the desk from him. Clooney is smooth in those scenes, canny and clever. We smile in the midst of misery; it's secretly fun to watch someone good at what they do. A murderer. A thief. A hatchet man.<br /><br />Believable? Borderline. But Ryan's "personal touch" is juxtaposed with new sidekick Natalie (Anna Kendrick), fresh out of college with the notion of firing people over the Internet - which means Ryan will be grounded, strapped to a headset, and stuck in a cubicle. Given the timing of "Up In The Air," and the economic meltdown that transpired in 2008, Natalie's "corporate concept," predictably debunked in the field, is ludicrous, for one. A "postal" invitation, for two.<br /><br />Ryan likes his life. He spends 320 days a year on the road. He enjoys an elite level of service in every airport, hotel and Hertz he enters. He's cultivated side career as motivational speaker, where he appeals to rooms of "warriors" like him to limit their lives to a backpack. No family. No entanglements. His parents are dead. His sisters are out of sight and mind in Wisconsin.<br /><br />But female fellow-warrior Alex (Vera Farmiga) provides a complication: Seemingly unburdened like Ryan, she purrs his way into his bed with the right mix of seduction and sass; Natalie pushes Ryan further toward love by projecting her own wishes for a relationship onto Alex.<br /><br />Ostensibly a film about a new, cold-hearted American economy - and, by extension, the world - the movie is actually an excoriation of the admittedly lemon-headed values of the Eighties and its offspring, the late Aughties, as children of the Reagan-era yuppie couples stride boldly - and somewhat foolishly - into the world, expecting it to shrink down to oyster size upon command, or, at the very least, the purchase of the appropriate technology and furniture. Natalie, played as a insufferable prig by Kendrick, quickly gets her wake-up call. Ryan's comeuppance marinates for the movie's running time and serves as a stunning detour to the predicted story arc.<br /><br />These penalties are fine, I suppose, but what's the moral here? Work shouldn't be important? If so, why the proverbial violin scenes where Ryan and Natalie 86 blubbering, pleading employees? Is sobriety the aim? Sadness? Pointed resignation to the world at hand?<br /><br />I don't think "Up In the Air" ever tries to figure itself out. Like Ryan, it lives in the moment, enjoying its overhead shots of various cities without minding the meaning. Consider that, in a key moment, we're meant to laugh at a lame engagement ring designed by the fiancee (Danny McBride) of Ryan's younger sister (Melanie Lynsky). The McBride character is a retread of Dermot Mulroney's idiot in "About Schmidt." Why is he a dope? Why is it funny that he's a dope, in a movie that makes pains to connect with "regular folks?" Why are small engagement rings funny? People lose their jobs - but the size of diamond remains sacrosanct?<br /><br />Why are we shown scenes of Ryan lecturing sizable groups of "backpack warriors," and none of him actually mingling with them? Because it's a construct. Why are they there? Who would choose to attend such a seminar? Samurai warriors? The crudest scene involves a suicide that mostly serves as a double-downer to Ryan's personal journey. Reitman wants to score cheap emotional points late in the game to catch up with the gloss that precedes it.<br /><br />And the movie has gloss. It's terrifically made, its screenplay light and clever, juggling several plotlines - the road trip, the prodigal son, the caustic corporate rant, the bizarre quest of Ryan's to reach a certain number of airline miles - with speed and ease. The skill in "Up In the Air" trumps its emptiness in many ways; only in the movie's final act do you see the hustle begin to emerge, the sweet con of overturned, folded cards.<br /><br />Farmiga is excellent as the sharp, non-committal Alex. Farmiga is comfortable being inside cold, rough characters, and she nails most of the notes she's forced to play. But she also gets off easy, and once the plot turns, you'll know why a short phone call that ends with the line "I'm an adult" doesn't even begin to explain the decisions Alex makes. Clooney looks thin, old. He's still a nice guy as an actor, self-aware of his charm - and how it wears off, after a moment. Some critics don't care for his sheepish notes, but I like them.<br /><br />But Reitman doesn't make either Clooney or Farmiga - or Kendrick, who's awful on purpose - get messy with their emotions. The great directors know how to take a scene up to the beat, and then just past it, into a raw, furious scream of drama, delivered in caustic, brittle lines. Wilder knew how. Lumet still does. Woody Allen once did. The best Europeans have that talent. There is a moment in "Up In the Air" that begs for a showdown. Reitman misses it. A shame. It's a keystone to the film's flaw - that it's trapped in Movieland, without the sense to get out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KFBAPAKMEQUF.html">A1KFBAPAKMEQUF</a><br/><p>This movie broke my heart - between the unexpecting employees being fired to the major disappointment with the main character and his love interest -- really a very sad film.<br /><br />However, with the economy continuing to collapse and the unemployment rate going up, this is a movie for its times.  Great acting and a good story make this a must see film.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Some great lines.

Nicely done.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>George Clooney has a tendency to pick movies with great dialogue and original storylines every year.  In 2009, it paid of with this drama that nabbed a Best Picture nomination at the Oscars.  The story background is about around a man whose professional life is traveling from company to company, where his job is to fire people.  The plot focuses on his life, and how it is complicated by a female colleague who is trying to change how he does his job.  There are numerous surprises throughout the movie, which is anchored by great dialogue from all the characters.  There is some romance, and some comedy.  Overall, a good movie, though I do not think it deserved a Best Picture nomination when other, better movies from 2009, such as Star Trek and Harry Potter, did not get a nod.</p></br><a href="../users/A15G70V9OBTOVO.html">A15G70V9OBTOVO</a><br/><p>I think this is where the viewer's own experience will figure in his/her reaction to this rather sad comedy.<br /><br />On the plus side, the arguments for why losing a good job is one of life's great opportunities are presented for what they are--nonsense, especially in the current job market.  As that ridiculously stereotyped young lady explains how being fired is just a step towards new horizons.  On the minus, there seemed to be a morality tale, as if Clooney was somehow being punished in his private life as comeuppance for what he did for a living.<br /><br />There is some clever dialog but even here its giving with one hand while taking with the other.  The subtext is that if you're clever and articulate enough you can convince people that the loss of a job, while serious, is likely to be an opportunity.  And frankly, the alternative to Clooney's lifestyle, the young midwestern couple getting married, didn't look all that appealing, either.<br /><br />No doubt this movie will resonate with a small number of people who ended up better off as the result of a layoff and those are the stories everyone likes to hear.  I worked for a company where everyone lost their job so I have some idea of the probabilities.  But its ironic, don't you think, that if people like Ryan Bingham actually exist, on the one hand, a company could be desperately trying to save money by firing staff while on the other, cover the cost of flying somebody all over the country to do what their own personnel department should do?</p></br><a href="../users/ADJBUPS8SJHTC.html">ADJBUPS8SJHTC</a><br/><p>If there was ever a lonely life to lead, then this movie with George Clooney and a cast of others is right on. Clooney plays an executive who goes from city to city(with a heap of flyer miles to boot)and fires people from their jobs. To watch these parts of the movie is sobering to say the very least and then it gets downright impersonal when a new young upstart(Anna Kendrick) brings in an idea to do it via videocam; First of all, it was funky doing it in personal, now it got downright terrible. Quite a sobering movie. Clooney already knows the drill and the job, but he meets a lady(Vera Farmiga), whom he likes because she lives a similar life and feels that perhaps she's the one for him but come to find out she has her own separate life that slaps him in the face. The scene where he is coming from meeting her and he finds out he got the 10 Million Miles points and special pin makes you wonder if that was worth all that he put up with. The young lady that he pairs up with and had the good idea, hits the road because the job gets to HER(imagine that) but all in all, the movie is worth the accolades it deserves. I must also speak on the opening song performed by Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings. That alone sets the tone for the movie and is worth you checking out the group on You Tube. I am sorry they didn't get Best Picture but it was worth the nomination it received. One more thing. Jason Reitman, who is the director, is noteworthy and one to watch for because this was his second time coming up for an Oscar and he's pretty much the new kid on the block.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A535W556ROBQ.html">A1A535W556ROBQ</a><br/><p>Ryan Bingham is close to chalking up a mythical 10 million miles on American Airlines when a perky new executive, Natalie, threatens to take the personal touch out of giving employees the boot by turning it into a web-cam experience.  Bingham is a no-nonsense "outplacement representative" who is close to reaching a major frequent-flyer milestone.  He also finds himself wrestling with a cardboard cut-out of his sister and fiance, which they want him to photograph in front of landmarks around the US.  Not to be thwarted from his "magic number," he leads Natalie on a round of outplacements to demonstrate that this is something that can only be done in person.<br /><br />Clooney has become quite comfortable in this type of role, growing ever more attractive with his gray highlights and open smile.  He seems to have met a good match in Vera Farminga (Alex), who similarly has taken on a pleasant "weathered" look, despite being only 36 years old.  The two play off each other like in a Billy Wilder movie.  Social commentary is kept to a minimum, although Natalie feels the brunt of outplacing persons when they are forced to give Detroit autoworkers the heave-ho.<br /><br />Jason Reitman seems more polished now.  He avoids getting overly sentimental, although there was a point where you thought this movie might go the way of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AOV4I">Sleepless in Seattle</a>.  Ryan manages to hook Alex into going to his sister's wedding with him, which to some extent forces him to re-evaluate his own life.  He seems almost to the point of giving up those swizzle sticks at executive class lounges when this airport romance hits some turbulence and he is forced to accept the cards that have been dealt him.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>This was a pretty good if not great story of a business traveler who spends almost all of his time on a plane--that is, when he isn't firing people or training others in how to do the same.  The film explores the lack of connection and empathy on his part in regard to the horrible job he has, and how others  can spend time with family while he has almost no one to spend time with except on a temporary basis.<br /><br />I'm not sure why this had so many nominations.  It's solid work from Clooney but certainly not his best role by any means.  His role in O Brother, Where Art Thou?  was much stronger and more substantial.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CK0VXUDVXGMN.html">A2CK0VXUDVXGMN</a><br/><p>What is with the adoration for this movie.  Stupid premise (are there really companies who are contracted out to fire employees of other companies - I doubt it), and a plodding plot line that made no sense in the end.  And Clooney was better in other movies, including Burn After Reading.  I only gave it two stars because somehow I made it to the ambiguous ending.  (Serious Man I turned off after ten minutes).</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>This movie isn't great, but it's okay to watch once. It had some pretty funny moments. George Clooney stars as Ryan Bingham, a man who goes around in a plane, firing people. He is forced to team up with a young coworker named Natalie Keener who is pushing a plan to cut costs by having employees stay grounded and fire people over the internet. That's basically it. I'd probably recommend that you go UP IN THE AIR!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>Hard to understand how a movie that manages to make you feel down in the dumps in many instances can have you laughing out loud the rest of the way. Perhaps because UP IN THE AIR is a movie so very full of surprises and complete knowledge of its main subject (I swear the next time I go through security in an airport I'll be looking for the oriental businessmen and avoid babies at all costs).<br />All throughout the movie I was expecting the obvious conclusion (the firer being fired) and was surprised to get something completely different in return, but even UP IN THE AIR's schocker scene, managed to make so much sense it's hard for me to understand how I didn't see it coming.<br />There's no question in my mind UP IN THE AIR will be the movie future generations will look back in trying to understand this particular era we live in. It is quiet simply a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/AR1T36GLLAFFX.html">AR1T36GLLAFFX</a><br/><p>Ryan Bingham (George Clooney)  has carved out a life of weightlessness (almost).  He's an executive for an out-placement firm that is engaged when a company needs to get rid of large swatches of their employees.  He's pared down his existence to a single carry-on; so much so that he's beginning to carve out a side career teaching others how to shed their possessions, their obligations, even their relationships and loved ones.<br /><br />He lacks one of the key elements of what it is to be human.  He's almost estranged from his family, he has no wife, no kids, no pets, not even a houseplant.  He does have a good business relationship with his boss, his assistant, and that's pretty much it.  He is so detached that he doesn't even notice anything is missing.  But, things will soon happen that shake up his world.<br /><br />On first viewing, I admired the acting (especially Clooney), the set design, the lighting, the cinematography, and the sound.  The story itself was clever, but the movie watcher really knew what was going to happen.  Bingham was going to experience something (or someone) that would make him realize that his goal of being the seventh person to achieve the coveted 10 million mile status (the youngest to get there) paled in comparison to his startling lack of human involvement.  The movie was extremely well directed (by Jason Reitman) and well achieved, but curiously non-involving.  It's good, but it's not a film that will be taken down from the DVD shelf very often.<br /><br />It's only after watching the commentary with director Reitman that I really appreciated the craft of the movie.  This commentary is why DVD special features were invented.  Playing the movie with the commentary on added a whole other dimension to the film.  Reitman grew up on Hollywood, his dad produced the film (Ivan Reitman), and he has many, many stories to tell about the making of the film.  So many, in fact, that he hardly ever stops talking.  There are two other members of the crew on the commentary, but you seldom hear from them.  Reitman just won't let them get a word in.  He's good and very entertaining to listen to, but why even have the other guys there?  And yet, he is entertaining as hell.  What a great dinner companion he would be.  Once he got going, you'd just sit back and listen.<br /><br />I do have to also comment on the film's 'fired folks'.  Some of them are actors, but most of them are non-actors who were asked by Reitman to appear on camera and sort of relive their own firings.  These non-actors were very, very good, and certainly lent an air of authenticity to the film.  A stroke of brilliance to include these people.<br /><br />Three and a half stars for 'Up in the Air'.  Four-and-a-half for the DVD extras (there's also an interesting interview with the company that did the opening shot, and other aerials in the film).</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>This movie  received almost universal acclaim by mainstream critics when it was first released.  Of the few that didn't like it, the commentary seemed to be more about the subject of firing people from their jobs.  George Clooney stars as Ryan who works for a company that handles employment terminations for other companies that don't have the balls to do it themselves.  Hell, I never even knew companies like that existed.  Clooney is cool as a cucumber in the role as you might expect.  He has no real home, or even financial or emotional objectives.  He just wants to fly and live in hotels across the country.  His only goal in life is to become the 7th person to fly 10 million miles on American Airlines.  American, Hilton and Hertz are prominently featured throughout the movie which I suspect help keep production costs down.  Ryan hooks up with another frequent flyer played by Vera Farmiga.  They become sexually entangled as they cross paths in various cities.  As part of a planned less personal approach to terminations Ryan brings with him a new, bright recently hired addition to the firm.  Natalie is played with unusual wit and sophistication by Anna Kendrick.  While not romantically involved, she and Clooney really work well together.  Kendrick is not your usual knock-out-gorgeous woman, but let's hope she gets more meaty roles like this in the future.  This is a smart snappy film about an otherwise unfortunate event that goes on way too often in America these days.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`Up In The Air' is a film that follows a man called Ryan Bingham (played by George Clooney) who travels around America firing people for various businesses and clocks up millions of air miles in the process. He prides himself on his independence and ability to have no responsibilities or commitments and seems to live a highly charmed life. That is until a young woman joins his company and tries to change the business model so he will eventually become grounded and virtually obsolete himself. He also strikes up an unusual relationship with a fellow traveller which starts to break down his hard outer shell and brings some real warmth to both Bingham and the film. Although there are some very funny moments in this film, this is not an outright comedy and in fact by the end it is tinged with a certain amount of sadness. Clooney plays his role excellently and I don't think I have seen him act as well as in this film. He is charming, detached, vulnerable, funny and more besides and manages to portray his character superbly. The other actors are also very good and Vera Farmiga is great as the fellow traveller who wends her way into his life. This is a gentle film and is very well written and this had me laughing out loud at times and also feeling a certain sadness at the end as well. The direction is great and I feel this to be one of Jason Reitman's better films to date and if he carries on like this then things can only get better. All in all this made for just over 100 minutes entertaining viewing and whilst it has a slightly downbeat feel to it, you will still reach the end having enjoyed it and with a sense of satisfaction.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>I thought Jason Reitman's "Up In the Air" was the best movie of 2009.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00275EGWY">The Hurt Locker</a> was good but overhyped.  The under-the-radar (in this country) BBC made-for-TV two-part docudrama <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003H8CK78">Occupation - Series 1 ( Occupation - Series One )  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 Import - United Kingdom </a>] was better than 'The Hurt Locker' in many respects.<br /><br />About 'Up In the Air': rarely has a film so incisively and painfully captured the spirit of the moment - mass layoffs, soulless firings, disconnected and transient lives.  Welcome to Corporate America, recession, jobless recoveries, the threat of double-dip recession and the possibility of more of the same over a long term.  Reitman's film nails the fallout from all that.  His coup is that interspersed amongst the scripted drama are interviews with real laid-off workers.  You can tell when these pop up in the narrative - there is real, palpable fear, anger and disappointment voiced to which no scripted work could do justice.  Reitman juxtaposes those pieces with the production line-like layoff work conducted by the characters portrayed by George Clooney, Anna Kendrick and Jason Bateman.  It's great film-making that serves to shake the heart and confidence of any working viewer.<br /><br />There's also some nice work here in smaller roles by the always good J.K. Simmons, Zach Galifianakis and - in a slightly bigger role - Danny McBride as Clooney's character's soon-to-be (or maybe not-to-be) brother-in-law.  And you'll burst out laughing when Sam Elliott makes his brief but all-too-perfect cameo.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>UP IN THE AIR (2009). Director: Jason Reitman. Based on the novel by Walter Kirn. 109 minutes. Winner of a ton of deserved Oscars, though not enough and not one for George Clooney. Clooney may be blessed--with Nick Clooney for a father, the late Jose Ferrer as an uncle, several Oscars and the shoe-in to play Cary Grant in any biopic in the works...but this film proves his luck.<br /><br />Ever been fired? I have--once--and this film begins by opening your eyes to what it is like. Several people are replying to the news that they have just been fired, one after the other, and your heart bleeds. They get angry, fall apart, whine like children. Oh yes, I recall the feeling. The humiliation, the jeers I imagined coming from all directions.<br /><br />Ryan Bingham (a radiant George Clooney) is the senior point man for the Career Transition Corporation--he flies about the nation firing people whose bosses are too scared to do it themselves. He is a proud, upright man who wants to feel for his victims--but he has no time for that. This man is a traveler, and a pro. He's like a martial artist, with every move choreographed from his tie collection with its very own leather carrying case to his Moonwalking out of his loafers at airport security. It was like watching a hilarious dance, from hotel rooms to onboard the planes.<br /><br />And he's just this side of 10 million frequent flyer miles...domestic!<br /><br />This film is, I have to say, THE most powerful statement about our economy, our national spirit and our loneliness. Woody Allen could not have made this film as good as it is. There is side-splitting repartee reminiscent of Allen's salad days; example, Bingham stewardess asks him if he'd like the cancer. The CANCER? Yes, would you like the cancer? Bingham is bewildered until the stewardess says WOULD-YOU-LIKE-THE-CAN-SIR?--referring to his beverage can. He rolls his eyes at her gross amateurism. That is how experienced he is.<br /><br />In fact the airport terminal/lounge is his home. Though a Wisconsin native, and the home office is in Omaha, Nebraska, Bingham's given up the lousy apartment he had there and simply whisks into the office and back out again.<br /><br />All that is threatened when young Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) steps in as a new hiree. She's there to computerize everything, and pull all the 'firing agents' off the road. The assassins must come in out of the cold, and Bingham does not like it. He challenges her, and soon they are on a firing trip together. They form a father-daughter type of bond, yet in the end they separate again.<br /><br />While Bingham woos his port-in-the-storm girlfriend Alex (Vera Farmiga), Natalie slowly crumbles under the weight of firing people. She simply cannot do the job. Bingham, while understanding and helpful, sees she is not right for it. In fact Bingham leaves her fairly shark-bitten when he challenges her to theoretically fire him, to prove his point.<br /><br />Ryan Bingham can manage to ferry his victims across the River Styx with gentle, professional calm. He's like a shrink, and naturally resents Natalie's psychology degree. Yet the whole idea falls through anyway, with Natalie quitting and other unexpected results. Bingham, pursuing Alex, finds her married with children. She tells him her family is everything to her...he on the other hand is nothing but company on the road. Normally we see men do that sort of thing to women!<br /><br />The cinematography is smooth and perfect, a bit 'mockumentary' at times; the soundtrack is well suited to this film. No overboard anything...but the lessons here! You MUST SEE THIS! The sadness of this film is seeing what matters (and what doesn't) to today's work force. In the end it isn't jobs: it's family. Some of the cameos here will show you what I mean.<br /><br />Bingham will learn that hard lesson but he will learn too late, as the fired individuals in a way are telling his story on certain levels. Zeitgeist isn't everything, and this film proves it. UP IN THE AIR is never patronizing, insulting or harsh. Yet it is so subtly funny you will really not know when to start/stop laughing. The "interviews" at the end, with the fired people saying their families helped them through it all, well....<br /><br />It seems the tone etc. of this film was inspired by a friend of director Jason Reitman's, who played him a song called "Up In the Air", which he wrote after getting fired. If this movie got no Oscars, all of Hollywood deserves a visit from Ryan Bingham. Certainly the two people who did NOT win an Oscar here: Clooney and the guy who wrote the original novel.<br /><br />My review seems piecemeal because, like Clooney's animated role FANTASTIC MR. FOX, this is something you have to see to believe...and enjoy like few other films you've ever seen. The really special goodies you will have to see/hear for yourself!</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>I looked up dark comedy in the dictionary and it had "Up in the Air" by it. There isn't much plot to the movie, yet it keeps moving. It makes a statement about following your dreams, family, and goals as Clooney's words somehow always come back to haunt him. I had to laugh at loud when Sam Elliot came back to talk to Clooney about joining the 10 million mile club. Shades of "The Big Lebowski." I kept expecting him to call George "dude" and tell him he was his father. The movie is bittersweet at times and sad at others, although not a tear jerker. I was confused about his occupation. He is paid to come into an industry and tell the workers they are laid off. Doesn't HR fire people? Do they really hire an outside company to do that? The irony of a man who fires people for a living speaking at a conference called "Goalquest" is a bit Orwellian. The best line in the movie was during a firing that he allowed his young assistant to do. She got into trouble, so Clooney the master ax man, steps in and says, "Do you know why kids love ball players?" The old man says "Because the make a lot of money and have sex with beautiful women." Clooney responds, "No, that is why we love them. The reason why kids love them is because they followed their dream." He then convinces the man he can be a hero to grand kids by leaving this job and following his dream.</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>this movie is strictly average, i'm not sure what all the hype is about.  it never transcends the basic plot of a business frequent flyer obsessed with himself who tritely ends up looking for deeper meaning.  too many scenes of airport terminals and chain hotels just end up reminding me of dull connections.  thumbs down</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>Ryan Bingham's (George Clooney) job is to fly around the country and fire people for companies who don't want to do it themselves.  He likes his work and his life, which is uncomplicated by relationships or domestic demands.  On one stop-over, however, Ryan meets a female version of himself (Vera Farmiga) and sparks fly.<br /><br />The success of this movie must be due entirely to the charm of its leading man, because it is in no other way unusual or special.  Clooney is indeed quite likable playing a slick smooth-talker while Farmiga is good in an undemanding role, but neither perfromance was  worthy of an Oscar nomination in my opinion.  The plot is pleasant enough, but hardly memorable, so I don't understand all the hype about it.  It was just okay for me and I've already forgotten most of it.  3.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>It's useless to state this year will not been reminded precisely as a fruitful one in which concerns the movies that have been nominated for the Academy awards.

For all the brutality of his role, Bingham has found a way to give fired workers the dignity they need to leave their old, familiar jobs. For this talent, he is highly prized...and compensated. His lofty lifestyle is laid out wonderfully - he wears the finest suits, he knows the best restaurants, hotels and credit cards, and commands the best service. When, on one of his trips, he meets Vera Farmiga (Alex Goran) whose passion and knowledge of the good life matches his own, it seems like a match made in the heavens.<br /><br />The wonderful thing about "Up in the Air" is that it doesn't follow any of the clich&eacute;d plotlines that could have emerge from this situation. For one thing, Clooney is saddled with a rcent business school grad who wants to replace him with a computerized script. The tension between technologized youth and wisdom and humanity is priceless and timely. It's hard to discuss the movie without giving the story away. Suffice it to say that nothing is what it seems, and turbulence is a certainty. A very fine film that plays to Clooney's roguish persona, "Up in the Air" is full of humor, wit, high passion, a glimpse in to the high life and genuine pathos.</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>A movie for the current times, Jason Reitman's latest work is touching and melancholy and doesn't provide any substantial resolve.

How much can really be outsourced these days?</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>It is certainly ironic that a film like "Up in the Air" should coincide with the global financial crisis and a very serious recession the United States.  Ironic, because the lead role of Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a hired gun.  He travels for 322 days a year firing people on behalf of downsizing companies.<br /><br />Clooney is wonderful in this role.  He is cool, calm and manages to remain detached from the raw emotions that can be provoked as part of the process of "letting people go".  Yet, for all his skill, he is marked for downsizing himself as a young woman in the office develops the idea of firing people online.  Instantly, travel and associated costs are eliminated.  But, so too is Bingham's very life style.  He lives for the life on the road and its privileges and anonymity.  He dreads having to return to his "home town" of Omaha.  Here, he keeps only a very modest apartment.  After all, nine days in ten sees him travelling.<br /><br />In his travels, Bingham comes across Alex (Vera Farmiga) who seems in a strange way to be his soul mate.  Ah, but there is more than meets the eye with Alex.  She has her own secrets which, in due course, are stumbled upon by Bingham.<br /><br />"Up in the Air" is a surprisingly good film.  It is deeper that I might have thought.  It is also funny and touching.  Perhaps George Clooney has been type cast.  This is a shame.  He is a very good actor and this role suits him admirably.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>From the director of "Thank you for smoking" and "Juno" comes another film called Up in the air. The film has been shot all over USA but yet what you get to see are yachts and getaway planes. You see airports, hotels, offices and you see people waiting in lines offended about some jerk who just cut them off in the line because he has special privileges. That jerk is played masterfully by George Clooney who's style of acting I'm finally starting to like. Vera Farmiga played a good co-star and the other actors, I don't know their names so I won't bother.<br /><br />In this film, Clooney shines as Ryan Bingham, a 40 something hedonist who is very good at his job and packing his luggage. The editing is sharp and the soundtrack was good.  I won't bother explaining his job but I can tell you one thing, this is one of those few films which are a little better than what the trailer offers. I don't think we can call this is an indie film because the subject matter is unique. I wondered how the film would end halfway through it. The dialogues are very entertaining and humorous without being fashionably dark.<br /><br />The only thing that surprised me was how I was the only person in the house-full AMC audi who clapped much to everyone's smiling displeasure. Do not miss this film, watch it on the big screen before they take it off. Some very good acting, good characters, good music and heavy handed end. This film has it all. It's not quite the "Catch me if you can" because it is not remotely about crime but still the subject matter is not only engaging but relevant and current. I'll put a full stop to my review now.

Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) flies around the country firing people for a living. He works for an Omaha-based company that is paid by other companies to fire their employees, a business that's booming in the recession. But ambitious young Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) proposes to save the company money and keep the terminators home by creating a system to fire people remotely, via a video link. Ryan balks, and his boss (Jason Bateman) sends him on the road with Natalie so that she might benefit from his experience, which also gives him a chance to hook up with Alex (Vera Farmiga), a fellow vagabond and itinerant lover.<br /><br />In spite of the security measures, oxygen deprivation, bad food, and cramped seating, this guy loves airports and air travel. The airport scenes are the most memorable and will probably be looked upon by future generations of filmgoers as representative of the times. That is where "Up in the Air" is most successful. It smoothly represents an angst peculiar to early 21st-century careerists who criss-cross the country to climb the corporate ladder. It also taps into one of the grim realities of the current economic crisis: high unemployment. George Clooney is charming. It mercifully avoids traditional romantic comedy territory. It wraps up neatly. "Up in the Air" is well-constructed light entertainment that stops short of being appealing.<br /><br />As suave and manipulative as Ryan is, he makes a living by lying to people. Natalie is alternately callous and childish. At some point it occurred to me that all three business travelers are dishonest, hypocritical, and distasteful. It was about the time the film turned preachy, not about the characters' lack of scruple but about Ryan's loner lifestyle, which is trivial. And it is the only thing about Ryan that is appealing. Why would a movie preach against the very thing that keeps us watching? We have a timely milieu, some sharp dialogue, and a trio of distasteful characters in a movie whose message is "everybody needs somebody". It's trite. What begins as an edgy dramedy ends up screaming: "I conform!" It's fun to watch Ryan and Alex one-up each other in one-liners and bedroom antics, but -yikes!- what an insidious, sheepish denouement.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2010): There are 5 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary, a teaser trailer (2 min), and theatrical trailer (2 ? min), an audio commentary, and one featurette. "Shadowplay: Before the Story" (2 ? min) is a brief interview with the artists of Shadowplay, a boutique studio that did the opening credits. The audio commentary by director Jason Reitman, cinematographer Eric Steelberg, and First Assistant Director Jason Blumenfeld is constant and informative. Reitman does most of the talking. They discuss the firing scenes, sets, lighting, changes from the book, filming challenges, and other technical stuff. Subtitles are available for the film English, French, Spanish. Dubbing available in French and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>It's interesting that this film was being described as somewhat "dark" and "downbeat."  It's also interesting that a number of people here who have given it a low rating have done so, they say, because the central character does not go through an epiphany or "change" in any way at the end.  In fact he does go through an epiphany, he does change, but because the film does not telegraph this with semaphores, a lot of today's "weened-on-James-Cameron" film-goers didn't get it.  The film isn't exactly dark or downbeat, but it does have an ending that does not reach a concrete conclusion, that begs to continue its involvement with the audience member once he or she leaves the theater.  And that kind of finish--Clooney was told before he read the script that it had a "70s ending," for me always a good omen--is rare today where the main character has to be too good to be true and everything has to be wrapped up in a pink bow and placed gingerly in the audiences' lap before they leave or they feel "unsatisfied."  God help them they should ever see some Robert Altman.  Or Ingmar Bergman, Jean Renoir or Rainer Werner Fassbinder!<br /><br />George Clooney, who is a just about as perfect a blend of Cary Grant and Gregory Peck as you can get these days, plays, well, George Clooney.  Only this George Clooney spends his time jetting from company to company firing workers who are being downsized by management.  Some people have called him "unsympathetic" for firing people for a living, and loving it.  They miss the point that he is not doing the firing; he's being hired by the company that is doing the firing.  If he didn't do it, those employees would still get fired.  As he himself explains, "What we do here is brutal, but at least I do it with a certain dignity."  I don't view this as self-rationalization.  It's simply an unpleasant truth.<br /><br />I don't know if there really are companies that fire people this way, but if there are it strikes me as wasteful to send dozens of people all over the country when they could have a few with well-defined territories, sort of like in sales, so that many could conduct much of their business by car.  (Of course, with the high price of gasoline, I'm not 100% sure this would work out any better these days.)  Clooney plays the disengaged professional very well, and what I particularly liked about his relationship with Vera Farmiga is that we don't see abrupt changes but rather a gradual softening of his exterior.  The low-key script has him gently pushing her to advance their relationship, advances which she ignores or rebuffs *very* subtly.  With Farmiga's character he's met his match: she tells him to think of her as just like him, only with a vagina.  It's not a trap.  That's just what she is--and yet isn't.  The scene where we find out why it doesn't work is well-written and unexpected.  (Instead of a big, explosive emotional outburst, which I feel a less-skilled writer would have written, we get a very calculated, well-reasoned reaction from Farmiga, which fits in well with her character's hyper-intelligent, hyper-professional persona.  She's juggling so much that someone more emotional and impulsive would not be able to make it work, and either the writers or Farmiga or director Jason Reitman realized that.  On another note Farmiga's performance is the highlight of the film.  In the scenes where she interacts with Clooney, she is often leading and he is following.  She seemed totally unintimidated by his star stature, and never seems to be trying to command the scenes she's in, but she does.)  On the other end of things is Anna Kendrick's Natalie--young, enthusiastic, just out of Cornell and dying to impress.  I've met similar people myself, and Kendrick manages to make this deliberately narrow character grow, at least somewhat, while still keeping her essentially the same.  It's another great performance, though this may be a matter of great casting (Reitman wrote the part with her in mind) rather than great acting.  My favorite shot in the whole movie is of her on the peoplemover gliding silently away from us after she quits.<br /><br />What Up In the Air tells us--that we all need someone, that, as Clooney's character puts it, life's better with company--is hardly a revelation, but what is is the quiet way Reitman directs, Reitman and co-scribe Sheldon Turner write, and the principles act.  There are few scenes of high emotion in this film, and those that are there are played broadly, as comedy.  (I'm thinking mainly of the part where Natalie falls apart because her boyfriend leaves her.  There's also some "comic relief" in the form of some of the fired workers, believe it or not, many of them played by actual fired workers saying the real things they said when they found out they were terminated.)  It's nice to see a comedy that relies on a raised eyebrow or a voice inflection to advance the story instead of cars crashing, blondes taking pratfalls in their underwear, dogs chasing dinner guests into swimming pools, etc.  And that ending, in which nothing's changed and yet everything has changed, is pitch-perfect.<br /><br />It's still, when you get right down to it, a simple film about the importance of family and relationships, and it doesn't really break any new ground, the resolutions with the unemployed at the end are a little too pat and even disingenuous, but still, as one of its own advertisements states, this is the kind of film Hollywood has forgotten how to make.  Thirty years ago it made plenty of them.<br /><br />The DVD, as with most Paramount productions, is fairly bare-bones.  You get a commentary track from Reitman, Turner and a few others, and outtakes that helpfully have commentary from Reitman as to why they were axed.  (The third act originally had a much different arc--viewers will be very surprised how things were supposed to go--and a bizarre sequence with Clooney floating around in a spacesuit examining his life from above didn't make it in, wisely.)  There's a very brief bit on how computer magic was used to create the opening titles--of interest to After Effects nerds only, and something I wouldn't think the target audience for this movie would care about.  Finally you get two trailers.  All of this material is anamorphic, so you don't have to switch modes if you own an HD TV.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P7WNM0UHV4YQ.html">A3P7WNM0UHV4YQ</a><br/><p>ok movie - a bit slow but tolerable and entertaining.

It also wasn't funny watching a sophomoric approach to firing people - especially by gutless managers that couldn't do it themselves. (I've never heard of that in reality.) Finally, the movie would have been more credible if George Clooney had been fired in the end, after his associates' "Go To Meeting" Internet no-travel approach had been institutionalized. At least she had the sense to move on with her life, leaving Clooney to return to being a lonely drag on society.

Thank You for Smoking and Young Adult are very good, while Juno and Up in the Air are close to perfect. All are a combination of drama and comedy, but Up in the Air has more dramatic elements than the other three.<br /><br />Ryan Bingham (Clooney) spends most of his life traveling. He flies from one city to another to fire people on behalf of companies who don't want to perform the task. We are told that he spent 322 days on the road the previous year. Although that kind of life would be detested by most people, Bingham likes it. He lives in hotels and his apartment is just an extension of that environment.<br /><br />The rest of Bingham's time is taken up by giving motivational speeches. His philosophy states that our lives are filled with meaningless possessions, so he asks us to imagine starting over. He also believes that people are weighed down by the relationships in their lives. Whether it's friends, work colleagues, family members or romantic partners, they can be the most significant burdens we face. As a result, Bingham doesn't allow himself to get close to anybody in any type of relationship.<br /><br />Does that sound depressing? Many of the people who dislike the film cite that as the main reason. I find it poignant, charming, intelligent and very funny.<br /><br />Bingham's existence is threatened when a potential innovation is considered by his company. Instead of sending representatives all over America, the company may switch to firing people remotely using an Internet connection. The scheme is suggested by Natalie (Kendrick), who is young, eager and ambitious. Bingham insists that she doesn't have a clue about the reality of his job and he's given the task of showing her how it works.<br /><br />The other major character is Alex (Farmiga). Bingham meets her by chance at an airport terminal and the two discover that they have a lot in common. Their initial meeting is very amusing.<br /><br />The main strength of the film is its script. Reitman injects humor into serious situations and lightens the mood. I do appreciate that losing your job can be a traumatic event, but Up in the Air doesn't take itself entirely seriously. Another strength is the acting. Clooney is magnificent at delivering humorous lines in dramatic situations and Farmiga gives the best performance of her career to date as Alex.<br /><br />My favorite scene - and there are many candidates - is probably the first meeting between Bingham, Alex and Natalie. The dialogue is fast-paced and witty and it's here that I know I'm in for an enjoyable ride. The way Natalie is completely oblivious to the fact that she's insulting Alex and Bingham makes me laugh every time. All three actors were nominated for their performances and I can see why.<br /><br />One of the best moments perfectly blends drama, humor and reality. Bingham shows Natalie how to fire people and one of the unlucky candidates is Bob (J. K. Simmons). Although he's only on the screen for a few minutes, Simmons delivers a memorable performance. He's initially unconvinced by Bingham's words and Natalie's attempts to intervene, but Bingham says something that reaches him. It's such a believable exchange. A potentially explosive situation is avoided and Bob walks away feeling positive about his future.<br /><br />I won't reveal any more of the plot, but I look forward to every scene when I watch Up in the Air. Bingham is the most intriguing character and it's interesting to see how his relationships and philosophy evolve during the film.<br /><br />I'm sure that people like Bingham exist. Many have observed that Up in the Air reflects the times in which we live. It focuses on loyalty and the uncertainty present in today's economy. I don't particularly care about its relevance. I watch it every few weeks because I love visiting that world. The final shot takes us into the air once more and there's a moment of silence. It's a perfect way to end the story and suggests peace and solitude. That's exactly what Bingham likes about his job when we first meet him.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>In a perfect world we wouldn't need undertakers or IRS auditors or for that matter an employment terminator.  In the latter occupation Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) does it so well even if he doesn't particularly like it or dislike it for that matter. To maintain some sense of sanity Ryan engages in casual affairs or keeps a log of his frequent flier miles and takes pride in the comps he's accumulated.  With the current economic climate things couldn't be better for Ryan's field.  Ryan, however, is at a mid-career crisis.  The home office in Omaha wants to keep him off the road by doing internet hook-up firings.  At home in Wisconsin he's reminded of the disconnect with his own roots and family.  At this crossroad Ryan has some serious choices to make.  I found "Up in the Air" to be a piece with director Jason Reitman's earlier effort "Thank You For Smoking" in that Reitman challenges the audience to sympathize with a central character with an unsavory occupation.  George Clooney is excellent in suggesting the complexities of Ryan.  The real find here is Anna Kendrick as Natalie Keener, Ryan's Ivy League protogee.  Natalie could have come off as an automaton but Kendrick mines the humanity and humor of the character.  Vera Fermiga is alright but essentially her character is the standard girlfriend part.  The accolades drawn by the film seem have caused a negative reaction among some viewers.  Divorce it from the hype you will find it is an excellent film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Think you've got plenty of frequent flyer miles? Wait until you meet Ryan Bingham (George Clooney, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JIE7JM">Burn After Reading</a>), a guy who flies almost nonstop. It's his job that gets him Up in the Air all the time. He travels around the States firing people as humanely as he can. Trouble is, though, is that this job makes him the most detached person alive. No family ties. Not married. No kids. Not even a real home anywhere. Ryan lives out of his carry-ons and knows how to move through airports like grease through a goose.<br /><br />But things are about to change. His boss Craig (Jason Bateman, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VEJKQI">Smokin' Aces</a>) just hired a hot-shot who's idea to tele-fire people remotely (via computer) has the potential to ground Ryan. But he's not giving up without a fight. This new up-and-comer named Natalie (Anna Kendrick) has a few thins to learn. So Ryan takes her on the road with him to show her why firing face-to-face has its merits.<br /><br />Paralleling Ryan is the female version of him; a woman named Alex (Vera Farmiga, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5AJQI">The Departed</a>) who so mirrors his sentiments that they seemed destined for one another. Sexual sparks fly but their jobs (and flights) keep them apart more often than not. Which initially seems fine for both of them.<br /><br />As Ryan shows hot-shot Natalie the ropes of how-to and how-not-to fire someone, we learn that Natalie is more brittle than previously believed. A broken relationship with a boyfriend sends her reeling, much to the confusion of Ryan who's never had a serious relationship in his life. "Everything I own can fit in this backpack. Even my relationships."<br /><br />But as Ryan sees his job changing, he also sees his life moving in a different direction. He's headed for a three-way fulcrum. The first is that he might actually need someone. And as he begins to see that not everything fits so neatly into his backpack, his feelings for Alex change his views. The second is that he has a family member who's about to get married, and he finds that seeing a wedding and how people actually enjoy needing one another changes his outlook. And finally we get to his frequent flyer miles. He's about to hit a milestone that only a handful of other people have made it to. Millions upon millions of miles. And as the realization that he's collected all of these miles alone comes to him, he finds that maybe, just maybe, he needs to make a connection ...not a connecting flight but an actual human connection.<br /><br />It is here that I have to end my summation of the movie and simply say that this isn't going to be some formulaic film where a person finds what they need and everyone lives happily ever after. Life just isn't that cleanly laid out. I applaud writer/director Jason Reitman for having the gumption to not take the road most traveled. Although I saw what was coming for Ryan after he decided to make a change, the impact of it astounded me. Clooney did a great job making us care for a man that we really shouldn't care for. We want to give him a shot at a normal life, but when that option is snatched away, we feel exactly the same way Ryan does: cheated.

His life of travel and shallow living hits a snag though when he is teamed up with fresh faced Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) who is looking at ways to reduce travel costs for CTC, but life on the road is where Bingham feels in his element.<br /><br />For years Bingham has used smooth talk and insincere advice to comfort those that he has fired, yet spending time with Keener, developing a relationship with a fellow work travel junky he comes across, and the marriage of his younger sister combine to undo his world of ostentation.<br /><br />The film narrative covers many themes such as selfishness, workplace cold heartedness, and reflecting on social attitudes that for a long time provided Bingham with comfort but are exposed to be flawed life compasses.<br /><br />It is a movie that viewers will be able to relate to in their own ways with an assorted storyline that is at times saddening, often humorous, and philosophically informative.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author</p></br><a href="../users/AGEIT17HENDIS.html">AGEIT17HENDIS</a><br/><p>The last time that I reviewed a film starring George Clooney in this space he portrayed a much put-upon, but ultimately triumphant, fixer-man lawyer in the film, Michael Clayton. I mentioned there that you may "buy" the fixer-man off, you may knock him around the courts a little with some silly law suit but in no way do you try to kill the bugger when he is doing what he does best, fixing things. Apparently, according the story line here where Clooney plays the hatchet-man for a company that "fires" high level people for those who do not want to get their hands messy, or place themselves in the line of fire if things go awry, that same poor judgment prevails here.<br /><br />Oh no, no one is trying to kill Brother Clooney here, well, except maybe kill his spirit through the huge advances in communications technology that allow a company to avoid the expenses associated with flying all over the place in economic bad times to do the "canning" and thus taking away an old school-style job from Clooney that he has become skilled at. It seems that somebody at headquarters got the bright idea to do the whole process by remote control, through computers. And the avatar of that idea was none other than a freshly- minted MBA (played by Anna Kendrick) out to win her spurs in the tough world of high-tech software innovations. Along the way though, as she tags along with Clooney on his aero-rounds, she gets "religion" and steps away to find a more socially useful way to flaunt her skills.<br /><br />But back to George. See, he can see the writing on the wall a little but he is determined to run a rearguard action to defend his reason for existence, his style. Here he is clearly the first, well maybe not first but close, post-modern plastic card man who like Saul Bellows' Dangling Man, or any one of a number of John Updike's modern men, lives a purely existential life, and likes it. With the exception of a baffling relationship with a fellow female business-class traveler (played by fetching Vera Farmiga) who, shockingly (to Clooney) and incongruously (to me), turns out to be just another soccer mom on a lark his life, his solo life, is lived in hotels, airplanes, and rental cars. By the way (BTW for the cyber-slang crazed) George Clooney's cool, clinical demeanor, and his quietly-determined quest for ever more frequent-flyer miles is perfect in this role. But one more time-don't mess with the fixer-man, or the hatchet-man, not if his name is Clooney. Got it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P98DMX8YUSNW.html">A1P98DMX8YUSNW</a><br/><p>The novel, by Walter Kirn, is a far better artistic experience than what they made it into here: a feel good flick about the importance of family. The novel is mostly interior monologue by the incessant traveler played well by George Clooney as a corporate hatchetman. I guess they needed more of a plot, of course, to make the film work better. This is an adult drama. No violence, no shoot em ups. Not for everyone, only those with a brain.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This is a good movie about a guy who is beginning to question his life - as a motivational speaker who fires people for a living - after a very successful career.  He meets this terrific woman, with whom he shares an hilariously low-key cynicism, in an airport bar on the way to one of his many road trips to whatever kind of a place to fire some more people.  He goes on a roadtrip with a neophyte hotshot that gets him to think a bit more.  They see a succession of airports, hotels, and wounded faces.  It is really quite depressing, but also very funny, kind of warm but knowlingly superficial.<br /><br />Of course, it doesn't work out the way he thinks it will, but he finds himself back on his routine. Nothing is resolved, there is nothing deep, no insurmountable tragedy, just life in America.  And beautifully done.<br /><br />REcommended warmly.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>Clooney and Farmiga are both sensational in this extremely clever, brilliantly realized comedy that is by turns a wonderful character study, extremely romantic and painfully relevant to business practices in today's cut-throat corporate world. Clooney has simply, never been better, and how the Academy failed to give him an Oscar, for such an incredible performance is beyond me ( actually, the Academy of Motion Pictures has quite a history of sad choices, and obvious snubs- but that's another subject... ). There's a really good twist to the ending, and although it may not be the biggest of surprises, it certainly keeps the movie real. If you liked SIDEWAYS, you'll probably love this absolute 'peach.'</p></br><a href="../users/A1UFV4HALV2OXW.html">A1UFV4HALV2OXW</a><br/><p>I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. George Clooney plays a guy whose job it is to go into companies and fire people. That's the basic premise, but this film is much more than that. It also focuses on his lifestyle: living out of a suitcase, with a practically unfurnished apartment that he "visits" only a few days a year, and no significant relationships to speak of. Both his professional and personal lives take drastic turns, and that is really what makes this movie appealing. This is a movie that evokes a wide spectrum of emotions, and that is truly what a good movie should do.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed watching Up in the Air. I was a bit worried this would turn into a typical Hollywood movie bashing corporations and celebrating "family values," but it's much more subtle. It's much deeper than I thought (certainly much more so than a typical George Clooney movie). Vera Farmiga and George Clooney add a lot of emotional complexity and are a joy to watch. My only disappointment was with Anna Kendrick - her acting was basically mechanical and forced. I'd definitely recommend checking this movie out.</p></br><a href="../users/AUUH6Z8MSGGF.html">AUUH6Z8MSGGF</a><br/><p><span class="tiny"> Length:: 5:49 Mins<br /><br /></span>Gina from Haunted Flower reviews the movie "Up in the Air" directed by Jason Reitman (who directed "Thank You for Smoking" and "Juno") and starring George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, and Anna Kendrick.<br /><br />[...]</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>According to the tagline of the film, "Up in the Air" is about "The story of a man ready to make a connection." The irony is that Ryan Bingham, our protagonist, is a corporate downsizer, a man traveling across the country to fire employees. He is hired by their employers who would rather not see them in person. He spends his days traveling around the country to meet people he knows he will never see again.<br /><br />"Up in the Air" is a comedy drama, but its subject matter is immediate and very serious. Another irony of the film is that Ryan Bingham, the corporate downsizer ready to make a connection, is played by George Clooney, one of Hollywood's most likable stars. In fact Ryan, always efficient and professional, is able to charm his way through life. Ryan is so confident, and perhaps he should be, though we are aware that behind the amusing (and satirical) sketches of him there is something missing in his life.<br /><br />Things get more complicated for him when Ryan meets two women: Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga), an enigmatic frequent flyer Ryan sleeps with, and Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), his ambitious coworker selling her own idea to Ryan's boss Craig (Jason Bateman): firing people through the Internet and video camera. Obviously Ryan's life is about to change, but can he really connect to other people? Or what does he want in his life?<br /><br />Having seen "Thank You for Smoking" and "Juno," I think Jason Reitman is one of the most talented directors of his generation. He turns controversial issues into drama with humor and thought-provoking challenges for viewers. He knows the right way to do it. You may not like what his characters are doing - and they often do it with confidence - but you definitely care them, or are at least interested in them and their life.<br /><br />Not everything is perfect, I admit. Though her acting is fine, Anna Kendrick's character (her back story about the boyfriend, for instance) doesn't really convince. The story is told with good pace, but some part of it is a bit familiar, and charming Melanie Lynskey is sadly underused. Still "Up in the Air" is an intelligent comedy drama with one serious theme, bolstered by superb acting from the three leads, George Clooney, Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>In "Up in the Air" George Clooney starts off as a cold-blooded, self-absorbed man whose job is telling people that their companies are firing them (laying them off). His business is thriving because we are, of course, in the middle of a recession, His job requires him to travel incessantly and rack up millions of frequent flyer air miles. His goal in life, perhaps his only goal, is to prove how self-sufficient he is and reach ten million miles. He's good at his job at giving people the ax and uses psychology to make them accept it. He's full of slogans and bromides for himself and others.<br /> The ghoulish company he works for has a lot of people on the road flying everywhere to tell people that they've been made redundant; that their jobs have been terminated. As far as the poor people are concerned, they as human beings have been terminated. In many brief scenes we see these people reacting sometimes profanely to Clooney's news. He also, in his spare time, gives inspirational talks on how people have to be sharks and worry only about themselves and their needs, not to weigh themselves down, the philosophy of selfishness.<br /> Along comes a young woman who talks Clooney's boss into taking all the bad news purveyors off the road to save money by having the hapless terminated people be informed by tele-conferences. Clooney says the idea stinks because the people need to confront a real person.<br /> He takes this young woman out on the road to show her what the human dimensions of the job are. She has to first learn to pack economically and not have any checked luggage. Out on the road, as she gives the bad news, one woman even threatens suicide. It's hell out there, she finds out.<br /> The movie presents Clooney like a twenty-first century gladiator, packing his roll-on carry on bag which effortlessly fits into the overhead compartment. It shows how efficiently he goes through security, how he goes to the airport frequent flyer lounges, how often travel workers greet him by name. He loves being the seasoned, honored frequent traveler. He's a pro at what he does, spending 322 days on the road. But isn't he in reality a loser, lacking a co-pilot, nothing but a parenthesis?</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) likes his unencumbered lifestyle--as a corporate downsizing consultant, he spends most of the year traveling across the country, breaking the news to the formerly employed that their positions are "no longer available" and "preparing" them for the next stage of their life by handing them a packet.  A number of events conspire to cause him to reevaluate his life: he is assigned the task of showing the ropes to a young up-and-comer (Anna Kendrick) who wants to rock his industry, he meets a woman (Vera Farmiga) that he actually wants to spend more time with, and a sister (Melanie Lynskey) he rarely sees decides to get married.<br /><br />This perceptive film about life, work, and the deep insecurities we all feel in these precarious economic times reminds us to cherish the people in our lives.  It is interesting that such a famously confirmed bachelor as Clooney stars in such a paean to the comforts of married life--sort of an "only Nixon could go to China" situation.  The entire cast is wonderful.  This film has moments that are unsettling, sad, and radiantly happy, making for a complete emotional experience.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>I don't get to travel nearly as much as I'd like to. I'd love it if I could go to a new city every few months, fly to places I've never been, see all the sites, and all that good stuff. That said, I don't know that I'd want to travel as much as the main character of Jason Reitman's latest film, Up in the Air, an isolated, rootless man whose goal is to reach 10,000,000 frequent flyer miles.<br /><br />George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a man who is on the road over 300 days a year. He's a master business traveler, who knows all the ins and outs of how to get through security quickly, how to get extra miles and comments on the fact that his goal of reaching 10 million miles is one accomplished by only six other people, which is less than the number of people who have walked on them Moon.<br /><br />He lives in airports, first class lounges and airplanes. He has an actual apartment near his home office in Omaha, but it's even more sterile and impersonal than the hotels he stays in.<br /><br />Bingham travels mostly for work, and his job is one I'd not heard of before: he goes to companies that are too gutless to actually fire people and does it for them. He does it in a firm, but not entirely impersonal, way and is very good at his job, and is appalled when he finds out that his company plans to ground him and everyone else and start firing people over the internet.<br /><br />This is one of the most adult movies I've seen, and by that I don't mean that it's filled with violence, sex or anything like that. No, I mean that it's a movie that's made by adults, for adults. It explores adult relationships from a very adult angle. You don't see lots of big hysterics or grand romantic gestures (and the only attempt at one of those backfires). You just adults being adults.<br /><br />Everything about this movie works and works well. The acting is excellent, the directing is top notch, the writing is fresh and intelligent. A particularly nice touch is that the establishing shots showing places like Kansas City and Wichita are done from an airplane looking down, as though one were a passenger. It's a nice touch.<br /><br />This is a completely entertaining and fascinating film. I fully expect it to get several Oscar nominations and rightly so. This is one great movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>In a wrecked economy at least one industry seems to be thriving:  the sacking folks industry.  In this interesting field of endeavor we find spineless, litigious-leery employers turning to third-party entities to perform the firings for them.  Thus we have the bizarre premise of an excellent film, UP IN THE AIR, the adventures of corporate head chopper Ryan Bingham (an aloof George Clooney) as he travels the U.S., suavely and swiftly terminating workers--all while rapidly approaching the coveted Ten Million Mile Membership.  Accordingly, Ryan is barely home 40 nights a year. . .until his superior (Jason Bateman is priceless) calls him back to corporate headquarters, as the technology is now in place to fire via streaming live video.  Alas, Ryan is grounded.<br /><br />Or so we thought.  The inspiration for the web cam terminations, young, gung-ho Natalie (Anna Kendrick), needs valuable experience in the field, so Ryan takes her under his wing and off they go to the airport, where Ryan tutors his protege on the fine art of streamlining travel.  And as they go, from city to city, Ryan hooks up with his female alter ego, Alex (a sizzling Vera Farmiga), while Natalie discovers she's just not cut out for the stark brutality of shattering a human being's life.  These interactions of the various characters furnish the charm of this film; they're not only infinitely interesting--they're very, very believable.  There are several termination scenes, some of them humorous, some of them disturbing, all of them compelling.<br /><br />Yet the beauty of UP IN THE AIR is its delicious irony.  Ryan, so proud of his fierce independence and reliance on nothing but a departure board, finds himself falling in love.  Yet the emptiness of his life resonates when Alex can't return the love (she has a family of her own); thus Ryan, on the side a motivational speaker, no longer believes the nonsense he preaches (jettison all the burdens of your life); he realizes he's trapped in the life he so meticulously created.  (As the old saying goes, be careful what you wish for.)  Accordingly there is an element of angst as UP IN THE AIR concludes, yet aren't there aspects of life much the same?  Besides, Clooney, Farmiga, Bateman, Kendrick, and the rest of a very diverse, ensemble cast make for some very spirited movie watching.  Wrecked economy or no.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></br><a href="../users/AGQY11NLQJ2JL.html">AGQY11NLQJ2JL</a><br/><p>Ryan Bingham makes his living going from one city to another laying off people so the bosses won't do it themselves. Ryan gets comfort from the routine he sets his life to and the way he convinces himself that he is fulfilled, until he meets Natalie.  Natalie is a motivated young lady who is trying to reduce the cost of sending people like Ryan to fire employees. Once Ryan's job is threatened by Natalie's idea, he agrees on taking her with him on a trip to show her how important his job is.<br /><br />The story might sound very simple and plain, but on their way, Ryan and Natalie develop a friendship that will change the way they see life and relationships. Both friends find out that their priorities are seriously flawed.  With a new perspective, that is less deceptive and delusional, both friends discover deeper aspects of life.<br /><br />With reflections on the meaning of love, family, and the importance of one's job, this movie is much deeper than you might think. This is one of the best movies of the year!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I must admit when this film started I thought I might be in store for just another romantic comedy, but my apprehension was soon thwarted as I found myself truly engrossed in this little film. Clooney who is a likable guy has almost always come off smarmy to me, but in this film he seems so right for the part and delivers a very solid performance. The rest of the cast is put together well with each tiny part adding a necessary piece to the puzzle. Of course I was expecting a very predictable ending and they through me a little curve which is always appreciated for film buffs like me who have seen way too many "Hollywood" movies. 'Up In The Air may not appeal to everyone, but it is an engaging film that feels very fresh!<br /><br />Thanks Queen B for recommending this one to me, although it was a while ago, I finally got around to it...and was well worth the wait!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ST1XBL6EQTBV.html">A1ST1XBL6EQTBV</a><br/><p>First of, I applaud the brilliance of Jason Reitman who masterfully<br />directed and wrote this film. He is proof that creative genius does<br />sometimes run in families. This film has very adult sensibilities in<br />it's wit & humor, it's weighty & timely subject matter, it's showing of how<br />we tend to compartmentalize our lives and attempt to control things in a way<br />which we think can gaurd us from being hurt, but of course, in the end we<br />are only fooling ourselves. Bottomline is, we are all built to interact<br />and in those interactions, there's going to be joy and there's going to be pain.<br />Nobody gets out of here unscathed, but if we are smart and lucky and take the risk<br />of commiting ourselves to something or someone, then we stand to gain much more<br />than we can ever loose. Out of all of George Clooney's performances so far,<br />I like him in this one the best!---He nails it and you feel for him completely.<br />His performance is supported beautifully by that of Vera Farmiga, who seems to be<br />his perfect female counterpart in his clean, cut & dry, no regrets/no attachments<br />life philosophy...at least it seems that way. (That later twist threw me for a loop!)<br /><br />Anna Kendrick is great as the young over-achiever college grad who, in her way,<br />thinks she has her life and career all mapped out, but she too learns that just when<br />you think you have all the angles figured out, the game of life switches & shifts on you.<br />Jason Bateman is also great in his supporting role as George Clooney's and Anna Kendrick's<br />characters funny but very bottomline boss.<br />I also think it was brilliant of Jason Reitman to use people who have really<br />recently been fired from their jobs for no reason other than the economic downturn,<br />because it adds such depth and reality to their reactions when Clooney's<br />and Kendrick's characters do what it is that they do for a living,<br />which is flying from city to city and being the human resources "heavies" for<br />companies who don't even have the guts to fire their own otherwise loyal and<br />hardworking employees face to face. Many of these people reflect the scenarios<br />of what so many others in this situation have had to deal with....just heart-breaking stuff.<br />This is a great film and deserves all the accolades it's received this year.<br />It gets off some great messages without being preachy about it.<br />A good addition to your DVD collection if you like films with substance and heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N49TOJZFG48H.html">A1N49TOJZFG48H</a><br/><p>you'll read from much better writers than myself state why you ought or ought not to consider this film for a rental and/or ownership . i was not always taken with George's films . i disliked the smirking , we're to sexy for these pictures (the Oceans films) beyond the 1st which i rather liked . additionally i'm not really smitten with political films . gradually Mr. Clooney began to win me over for a number of projects and reasons though . i saw him in Syriana and was impressed (even though it was a political Film) . when next i chose to see him it was at my parents urging in the flawed (at the end) but largely excellent Michael Clayton . those films and the acclaim heaped on this picture made me go all in and rent it . i'm glad i did . i feel it's his most mature and best work to date . the entire cast is outstanding . its young writer/director is obviously no slouch . being related to the jazz songbird Rosemary Clooney did not hurt either . modern film for smart people . hope you like it .</p></br><a href="../users/A1OBJ2263JCK5.html">A1OBJ2263JCK5</a><br/><p>In the run-up to the recent 2010 Academy Awards, it seemed like the only thing people could talk about was the matchup between the mighty "Avatar" and little "The Hurt Locker". Both fine films in their own right. But lost in all the noisy hub-bub was another small, marvelous, nominated film. It had no space aliens or bombs going off. Instead it was just a well made, quiet, intelligent film about people called "Up in the Air".<br /><br />In "Up in the Air" we meet Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), who makes his living traveling from company to company firing/laying off employees in the downturn economy. In other words, he's a professional hatchetman. He does his job with a certain sense of style and grace. He sets people adrift, gently. He travels without end, living a life, that is mainly made up of airport bars & lounges, rental car counters and chain hotels. What we hate about traveling he loves. His one kick in life seems to be collecting exclusive memberships in travel industry clubs, that offer big perks to those on the road and in the skies. What he dosn't have is a real home, wife, children or significant other ETC. Instead he espouses and lives an insular life without any true emotional responsiblities or commitments.<br /><br />This all changes when two women enter his life. One is Natalie (Anna Kendrick) a smart, energetic, young woman, who's business ideas could lead to the end of Ryan's nomadic wanderings (she wants employees fired via the internet). The other is Alex (Vera Farmiga), a mature, sexy business woman, who seems 'to get' Ryan's interests and lifestyle. Ryan and Alex meet at various junctures on the road for a series of sexual liasons. Together, these two interesting women turn Ryan's life upside down, causing him to finally question the path he has chosen for himself.<br /><br />Writer/Director, Jason Rietman has created a film, which is a wonderful character study. It portrays a man, who at first thinks he knows it all, but winds up eventually questioning everything. I love the way Reitman strips away his characters, until finally the truth is revealed. "Up in the Air" has a smart and funny script, which has razor-sharp, intelligent dialogue. It treats its characters with respect. I really love the fact that this movie dosn't try to tie everything up with a fake Hollywood ending. Instead the film leaves us on a more ambiguous note.<br /><br />The cast in this film is steller. George Clooney essentially gives the best performance of his career (so far). Anna Kendrick also gives a poised, well acted performance as the young upstart, who is both a pain and conscious for Clooney's character. But the real discovery of the film is actress, Vera Farmiga. She really gives a "star is born" type of performance. Its hard to match an actor like Clooney, charisma-wise, but Vera Farmiga manages to do it. Her sexy, smart business woman really jumps out at you. Its an amazing performance. I predict big things for this actress in the future.<br /><br />I think "Up in the Air" was one of the best movies I saw all year. Its both heartfelt and humorous. A great piece of storytelling. Give it a try!</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>Jason Reitman's Up In The Air deftly balances a light comedic approach with the stark reality of today's down economic times.  George Clooney is at his confident & charming best as Ryan Bingham a hired corporate hatchet man who fires people for a living and spends about 320 a year on the road.  Ryan has created a bubble for himself where he has essentially shut himself off from any personal relationships including his family and has stripped himself of most of his possessions to those only of essence to his work existence.  He meets the sexy and smart Alex (Vera Farmiga) on one of his trips and they set His world is threatened to collapse when a young Ivy Leaguer, Natalie (Anna Kendrick) joins his company and pitches an idea to eliminate the need to go on the road by doing the firings over the internet.  Ryan balks at the idea and reluctantly takes Natalie on the road to show her the ropes.  Along the way Ryan starts to break out of his self-imposed cocoon and see that people and personal relationships are important.  Mr. Clooney, Ms. Farmiga and Ms. Kendrick all give Oscar worthy performances and the rest of the cast is equally appealing including Jason Bateman as Ryan & Natalie's somewhat sleazy boss and Danny McBride as Ryan's soon to be brother-in-law.  J.K. Simmons has a hilarious and poignant cameo as one the people Ryan & Natalie fire as does Zach Galifianakis in the opening scene as the first person we see Ryan fire.  Up In The Air is a movie set in the current economic times, but contains timeless performances that will make you laugh and maybe even bring a tear to your eye.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Ryan Bingham who makes his living personally handing out pink slips, he's the top hatchet man at a company that other companies hire when they are downsizing. And since business is booming, his job keeps him on the go constantly. He flies all across the country, staying in a series of nice hotels. And although this itinerant lifestyle prevents him from having any kind of stable, regular life, this doesn't bother him in the slightest, he's thrilled to be a boy in a traveling bubble. "Up in the Air" is so truthful, particularly penetrating and effective movie. Reitman proving to be a force to reckon with and Clooney that he just keeps getting better with age. Very entertaining movie, see for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>George Clooney does a terrific job in this drama comedy about the ultimate in alienation in the American work place.  His job is firing people around the country.  But that's just the surface.  He is the ultimate disconnect, the logical progression of where we went as a people in moving our work lives further and further away from the rest of our lives.  Clooney's character made the total jump and has NO life apart from moving from airport to airport and hotel room and hotel room as he does his job. His apartment could be a hotel room.  There are two women who start to warm him up into becoming a human being.  One is a career woman who like he is in the air a lot.  The other is a new female protege who has been hired to revolutionize the whole process so that she can fire people over a laptop linkup.  Clooney will be doing the same.  The young woman, however, unlike Clooney and the career woman, is a ball of emotion over everything.  She took this job solely to follow a man to the city rather than having a man follow her (since she was the top of her class). He breaks up with her and she melts down.  It turns out she wants ALL the personal stuff and this corporate lifestyle was something for her to do before she got it.  So here she is the brightest and most modern of all of them, a whiz at high tech no less, yet she is also the least alienated. The difference is that she is emotional.  Clooney begins to wake up to his own emotions and starts to become a human being as well.  His life begins to get messy in all respects which is what emotions do to us. See this film.  It is terrific.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>Director Jason Reitman, the director of Juno, has given us one of the best films of the year with Up In The Air, a superb character study about the meaning of life. Both heartbreaking and hilarious, this is a culturally relevant and timely film that is not easily forgotten.<br /><br />George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a man who fires people for a living. He basically executes what the big bosses are too timid to carry out themselves, and he has it down to a science. On the side, he is a motivational speaker who encourages his listeners to get rid of the excess baggage in their lives, in an effort to reach their personal goals and make their dreams a reality. The only problem is that Ryan does not have much of a life to speak of. He lives out of his suitcase, and has distanced himself from his friends and family, and has given himself over to casual relationships instead. His personal goal is to reach ten million frequent flier miles, and he is almost there. On one particular business trip, he meets and becomes close with a fellow frequent flier named Alex. They instantly hit it off, and begin an affair.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back at the company offices, Ryan meets his new colleague, Natalie Keener. She is young, headstrong, and ultimately determined to work her way up in the business. Ryan feels threatened by the young lady, and insists that she is too na?ve to carry out the demands of the job. It is at this moment that the boss suggests that Ryan take Natalie along with him on his travels to show her the ropes. She goes along with Ryan, and sits beside him as he brings in numerous unsuspecting individuals, and informs them that their jobs have been terminated. He asks each individual to see the situation in a positive light. It's not a termination so much as it is an opportunity to begin again. Ryan is a master of persuasion, and some people step away with a hopeful outlook. Others break down in shock - angry, frustrated, and confused. After a particularly disturbing encounter, Natalie begins to examine her position from an ethical standpoint. Of course, Ryan is there to soften the blow, as he tries to put things into perspective for her, with ambiguous results. Natalie returns to the main office, where she formulates a system that will allow her to fire people via the internet, rather than having to do it face to face.<br /><br />Alex meets up with Ryan shortly thereafter, and their relationship grows from casual to something a bit more serious. Ryan invites Alex to his sister's wedding, and she accompanies him. It is during this time that Ryan's journey really begins. Will he remain an avid frequent flier, living in isolation, bouncing from hotel room to hotel room, or will he grab hold of the life that he has left and find true meaning? This is the existential dilemma that drives the film.<br /><br />The performances are excellent all around. George Clooney plays Ryan, and totally becomes the character. This is his best performance in years. It's Clooney as you have never seen him before. Vera Farmiga plays his love interest, Alex.  She may receive an Oscar nomination for her work here. Anna Kendrick plays Natalie, and she is simply breathtaking. She has come a long way since Twilight.<br /><br />Jason Reitman proves once again that he is a director to watch. This film is just as strong as Juno, and just as important.<br /><br />Rated R for language and adult content.</p></br></body></html>

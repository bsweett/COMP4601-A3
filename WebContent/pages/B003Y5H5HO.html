Despite the slow exposition, the story picks up when Daniel Craig as journalist-investigative reporter, Mikael Blomkvist, is hired by Swedish magnate, Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to solve the mystery of the disappearance of Vanger's beloved niece, Harriet, who vanished from the family compound forty years earlier in 1966.<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the film is how Blomkvist, with the assistance of Goth-like computer hacker, Lisbeth Salander, partially solves the mystery, mainly by discovering clues buried in old photos taken at the time of Harriet's disappearance. One is reminded of Antonioni's 1966 film 'Blowup', which was released in the same year the murder mystery in 'Tattoo' is supposed to take place.<br /><br />There are other well done scenes in 'Tattoo', particularly the harrowing rape scenes where Lisbeth is violated by her court appointed guardian and later when she turns the tables on him, an example of vigilante justice. Equally as gripping is when Blomkvist is imprisoned by Vanger's serial-killer nephew, Martin, who tortures the journalist but is saved by Salander, who arrives in the nick of time.<br /><br />The acting is mostly excellent, including Rooney Mara, who plays the glum, rebellious 'damaged goods' ward of the state, with aplomb as well as the always solid Christopher Plummer. The bad guys are equally as menacing--only Daniel Craig, seems out of place, as he doesn't seem like he's from Scandinavia. To be fair to Craig, the script saddles him with a rather deadpan part, with Blomkvist the least interesting of the principal players. One unfortunate shortcoming in the Hollywood version is that there's mention of a number of characters with a 'Nazi' past, but the nature of that connection is never explored in any detail whatsoever.<br /><br />Despite a thriller that keeps one's interest to the end, nagging questions remain which tend to lessen the film's overall impact. For starters, we find out little about the nature of the lawsuit, which Blomkvist loses at the beginning of the film. Why is the crooked businessmen, Wennerstr&ouml;m, so evil? Vanger seems to think so, and promises to give Blomkvist the evidence once he completes his assignment. But Blomkvist tells Vanger at film's end that the 'evidence' is meaningless and we never find out what it's about. I realize that in a film such as this, which is already quite long, the scenarists don't really have a lot of time to explain all the, but still, the reason why the whole story is put in motion is principally due to the main character losing this lawsuit. And when Lisbeth hacks into Wennerstr&ouml;m's computers and steals all his millions, do we really care? And do we really care when he's murdered? In reality, Wennerstr&ouml;m is really a cypher of a character.<br /><br />I also wonder why Vanger hires Blomkvist in the first place. Wouldn't he have done better to have hired a private investigator or someone involved closer to law enforcement? I realize Blomkvist is an investigative reporter but he's also the co-owner of a hip magazine--hardly the type of person to take on such an assignment. Yes, of course, he's just lost his life savings and he's desperate but the entire arrangements seems a bit odd. There's also the issue of Blomkvist's competency--he's just lost that lawsuit and even though Vanger likes the idea that he opposed Wennerstr&ouml;m (who's a long term rival), the fact that he made accusations without proof, wouldn't have impressed a real life Vanger, who would have probably gone for someone whose past, in contrast, was squeaky clean.<br /><br />Even if one is willing to suspend one's disbelief regarding Blomkvist taking on Vanger's proposal, the whole idea that the brilliant Lisbeth would allow herself to fall into her evil guardian's clutches more than once, seems pretty incredible. Just like Blomkvist, who stupidly "miscalculated" about the lawsuit, Lisbeth admits to misjudging just how sick (as she puts it) Guardian Bjurman really is. And what about Lisbeth running out of money? Wasn't she paid a fair amount by Vanger to investigate Blomkvist before he hires him? You would have thought she would have had some money left over to the buy that new computer. And since she's so clever, why couldn't she just go out and get another freelance assignment to pay the bills, instead of relying on her pervert guardian? If she's smart enough to steal three billion dollars from a mega-rich businessmen, couldn't she have hacked into a lesser fry criminal early on, put a few bucks into her account, and avoided being dependent on Bjurman?<br /><br />Regarding Lisbeth, there were a couple of other things that seemed a little 'too easy'--for example, Martin forgetting to lock the doors behind him when he went downstairs to torture Blomkvist. Lisbeth just walks right into the house (no alarm is triggered to warn hi-tech guru, Martin) and she then all too easily slips into Martin's torture chamber and saves Blomkvist from a horrible death. And wasn't it sort of a little too easy for Lisbeth, to hack into Wennerstr&ouml;m's accounts? But this is Hollywood, so anything can happen, no?<br /><br />Finally, I was curious about Vanger's assumption that Harriet had been murdered. He states that Harriet couldn't have gotten off the island since none of the boats had been used and the police had prevented everyone from leaving. But the next day, the police relented...SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD...and that's exactly how Harriet escaped--in the trunk of her cousin Anita's car, who had helped her. Why didn't this scenario occur to Vanger? Had he followed through on such an assumption, of course there would have been no movie!<br /><br />If you're not too picky about Tattoo's contrivances, you may find yourself enjoying this tale of suspense. For more critical and/or discerning viewers, you may end up with the conclusion that this is by no means a masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>When I saw this, I had no idea that there were another complete version of the work available, but had been told the novel was great by my wife.  This film so completely absorbed and fascinated me that I watched it twice on a trans-Atlantic flight, each time reveling in the details and the absolutely superlative acting.  We know Craig is first rate - but so is Roony, whom I had never seen before.  Indeed, she is pitch perfect:  a damaged, enigmatic woman full of rage, with a particular talent, perhaps even genius, and a streak of cruelty.  I will have to buy this when the price is right, as I will want to watch it many more times.  I will get the other versions as well.<br /><br />A disgraced journalist, Craig, is given a task by an ailing industrial magnate, who recognizes his family is full of crazies.  Craig becomes absorbed in the task, eventually taking on Roony as his assistant.  She soon proves invaluable, fighting her own battles all the while and emerging as a stunning and dangerous beauty.  Somehow, he touches her heart, unlocking secrets but also sensitivity and pain.  What they find was a complete surprise to me in all of its facets.  I don't want to reveal the plot, as it has many quirky twists that add subtle tastes to a somewhat traditional film noire plot line.  But the resolution, and the girl's actions, make this the most deliciously wicked treat.<br /><br />Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>'The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo', is one of the most talked about book seires these past few years and after reading the first instalment I understand why. It is a captivating white knuckle thriller that really breaks all the rules with bold and sometimes disturbing moments that just keep reading. So when they announced that an American version of the already made Sweedish film was on the way of course I was ready to go.<br /><br />The director David Fincher already was one of my favorite directors and I love his work and of course this time he directed another winner. While there were some differences from the transition of book to film it was a movie that was just as gripping and bold as the pages. The cast was great and I knew that Rooney Mara would do a great job portraying Lisbeth, even getting an academy award nomination. Daniel Craig can do no wrong and even Robin Wright supprised me a little in the role she played as well.<br /><br />I am a bit upset that this film didn't get the box office notice that it truly deserves, but at the same time a film that deals with some very debated topics is not one that the collective film going public would agree upon. I was happy that certain moments as graphic as the pages mentioned did show up on the film. I really hope that the universal concensious will not prevent the next two chapters from hitting the big screen and I hope that Fincher stays on to direct along with the cast and hopefully Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for the soundtrack.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>Stieg Larsson is known in Sweden for his contribution to sci-fi fandom but to the outside world, he is known posthumously for his "Millennium" trilogy especially with the novel "M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor (Men who hate women)" aka "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo", the first novel of the trilogy and a novel based on manuscripts by Larsson written  but unpublished until after his death in 2004.<br /><br />In 2008, Larsson became the second best-selling author in the world and the trilogy had sold 27 million copies in more than 40 countries.<br /><br />In 2009, the film received its Swedish adaptation and the film which was created for $13 million would go on to earn $102 million worldwide and with the success of the novels and the Swedish film, it was no surprise that Hollywood would come knocking and create an English version of the popular storyline.<br /><br />The 2011 version of "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" was directed by award-winning director David Fincher ("Fight Club", "Se7en", "The Social Network", "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button") with a screenplay by veteran writer Steven Zaillian ("Schindler's List", "American Gangster", "Gangs of New York").<br /><br />The film would feature the cinematography of Jeff Cronenweth ("Fight Club", "The Social Network", "One Hour Photo") and music by Trent Reznor ("The Social Network, "Se7en", "Lost Highway") and Atticus Ross ("The Social Network, "Twilight", "Limitless").<br /><br />Starring in the film are Daniel Craig ("Casino Royale", "Quantum of Solace", "Cowboys & Aliens"), Rooney Mara ("The Social Network", "A Nightmare on Elm Street", "Youth in Revolt"), Christopher Plumber ("A Beautiful Mind", "The Sound of Music", "Beginners"), Stellan Skarsgard ("Good Will Hunting", "Thor", "Mamma Mia") and Robin Wright ("Beowulf", "Unbreakable", "Moneyball").<br /><br />The film was quite successful in the box office earning over $229 million and also winning and being nominated for a plethora of awards worldwide.  Including an Academy Award for "Best Film Editing" (Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter).<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is presented in 2:40:1 anamorphic widescreen and presented in English and French 5.1 Dolby Digital and English Dolby Surround plus an English audio descriptive track.  It's important to note that "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" will be released on Blu-ray and this is one of those films that are shot in a variety of locations, beautiful cinematography that would look absolutely fantastic on Blu!<br /><br />I didn't notice any compression artifacts or any major PQ problems.  Personally, I was impressed by the cinematography that I actually am looking forward in picking this film up on Blu-ray and watching it via HD.  It's a stunning film that the David Fincher and David Cronenweth really did a wonderful job in bringing Stieg Larsson's novel to life.<br /><br />As for audio, once again, this is where audiophiles would opt for Blu-ray for its lossless soundtrack.  On DVD, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's music sounds clear and there are moments of action scenes such as a rifle shot and explosion, but it's a film where ambiance plays a big role in the film and what you hear the most through the surround channels.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" comes with the following special feature:<br /><br />  Commentary by Director David Fincher - Featuring an in-depth audio commentary by director David Fincher.  From discussions of the cast, the characters, locations, stunts and overall making of the film.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />My first foray into "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" came from my wife.  Her family members have loved the novels and my wife was going crazy reading all three novels and then watching the film.  She has told me many times to read the novels in the trilogy but with so many books in my reading queue, I figured, why not see what the hype is all about and watch this film for myself.<br /><br />When I watched the Swedish version of "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", I was drawn in by the performances of Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace.  Their performance was magnificent, as was the cinematography by Jens Fishcer and Eric Kress.  Just the amount of footage shot in various weather conditions and locations was quite impressive but most of all, bringing the novel to life (as my wife would say).<br /><br />I also knew there would be a David Fincher version of the film but I was skeptical at first because I enjoyed the Swedish version so much.  When it was revealed that veteran Steven Zaillian would be writing the screenplay version and that Daniel Craig was hired to play Mikael Blomkvist, I figured, let's see how things go.<br /><br />Similar to the Swedish version of the film, I absolutely enjoyed Fincher's version of "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo".<br /><br />This film was not only suspenseful but it literally sent chills down my spine.  The film is not for the weak at heart when it comes to violence and torture.  The film has many graphic moments of people who have been murdered, people who have been raped and I'm not going to sugarcoat things... this film is violent.<br /><br />But the film is also a suspenseful, haunting thriller that not only grabs your attention, you literally root for these characters that are completely opposite but they take you on an amazing ride with quite a bit of twists and turns along the way.  I have no problems saying that "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is one of the best modern suspense films that I have watched in long while.  And I'm talking about overall acting, cinematography, pacing and how well the story is conceived.  It's a fantastic film!<br /><br />Personally, these characters are what I loved about the film.  The character of Mikael Blomkvist is an experienced writer who is taking on a billionaire and now having to face a serious libel charge that he libeled him due to false information he was given.  While I was skeptical of Daniel Craig at first, he managed to do a fantastic job playing the character. But the character I was the most skeptical is Lisbeth.  Noomi Rapace was fantastic and when I saw pictures of Rooney Mara prior to her playing Lisbeth, I was not sure how this would play out, but she instantly transformed herself into a new breed of Lisbeth.  Different from Rapace's version but still effective.  As for the character of Lisbeth Salander,  to see her as an anti-social, goth-like computer hacker brought another dimension to this film.<br /><br />But what works is the slight changes that were made to this 2011 American version of the film from the original Swedish version of the film.  The American version actually incorporates more of the book to its storyline than the Swedish version.  For one, Blomkvist is not a character that has to be worried of going to prison.  This impacts Blomkvist in the Swedish version of the film, in the American version, he does not have to worry about prison time at all.<br /><br />Another major difference is that the book focused more on the relationship between Mikael's Millennium Magazine partner Erika Berger and this is more evident in the American version.  Also, in the book, Mikael's daughter had importance and in the Swedish version, she was barely mentioned. In the U.S. version, Mikael's daughter is a major key to the discovery of deciphering the code made by Harriet.<br /><br />There are also quite a bit of differences involving Lisbeth Salander, such as the Swedish version has her mugged by a gang of men, not the case of the US version.  Also, the introduction between Mikael and Lisbeth are very different between the two films.  But most importantly, the relationship of both Mikael having to work with Lisbeth and how it affects the characters to the final scene of the film.  Which I actually enjoyed from the American version over the Swedish version of the film.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the Swedish version a lot, in many ways I also enjoyed the American version even more.  Mainly for its attention to details from the book that was incorporated into the film, although I enjoyed Noomi Rapace's version of Lisbeth Salander even more, Rooney Mara's version actually works much better.  But I do enjoy both films a lot, it's just that the 2011 version, they were able to incorporate more of the book and tweak the storyline a bit more.<br /><br />I suppose it's a bit more subjective to the viewer familiar with the Swedish film and the book but if I wished there was two things that weren't changed in the American version, it would revolve around Blomkvist's problems with prison time and a scene revolving Lisbeth and the assailant, which I enjoyed from the Swedish version even more.<br /><br />If there was one subject that I feel may touch a nerve with viewers is a rape scene (well, actually there are others who have been raped and tortured) but there is one graphic scene that may turn people off.  I for one, dislike disturbing scenes like this in a film especially if was done for shock value.  In the case of "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", although a film that contains a lot of violence, I felt that the violence was not gratuitous and was appropriate to the story but again, this is subjective as I've read those who felt it was appropriate and others who felt it was bit too much for their taste.<br /><br />As for the DVD, the DVD doesn't come with a lot of special features but an audio commentary by David Fincher.  As mentioned, if you want the best version of the films, go for the HD release as I'm sure the film will look and sound incredible on Blu-ray.  A movie this good, demands to be seen on Blu!<br /><br />"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is a fantastic film featuring an awesome performance by the talent, a chilling screenplay adaptation and wonderful cinematography and music.  It's a film that will no doubt send shivers towards your spine but you will feel that you are captured by the film by the solid performances courtesy of Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara.  These two were absolutely wonderful and felt that Steven Zaillian and David Fincher did a magnificent job in including more of the book to this adaptation of "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo".  And I can only hope the two work together again for the second film and see if they can fix some of the problems that the Swedish version of the film was criticized for.<br /><br />Overall, I absolutely loved this film and if you have not watched this film yet, I absolutely recommend one putting this on their must-buy list for 2012.<br /><br />"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has a rather large fan following and for good reason. The 2009 Swedish film is incredibly solid and well-acted with just the right amount of wrong. The two sequels that followed had their own uphill battles (switching directors, lower budget, etc) and weren't necessarily bad, but just failed to capture that raw emotional tenacity the original film offered. When news of a remake began making the usual rounds, there was a fairly large uproar amongst the internet community (isn't there always?), especially when it was announced Noomi Rapace wouldn't be returning as Lisbeth Salander. Most American remakes aren't directed by David Fincher though and while it isn't vastly different in comparison to its Swedish counterpart, Fincher has at least improved upon what was already a fantastic piece of cinema.<br /><br />The opening of the film was a bit unexpected. "The Immigrant Song" cover by Trent Reznor and Karen O plays over these really fluid visuals that are a bit hard to describe. Imagine the T-1000 from Terminator 2 made of motor oil or tar instead of metal and you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It was just very different from other film credits from the rest of the year while also being very sleek, very stylish, and very David Fincher.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is extremely dialogue driven, so be prepared for a lot of talking. It feels very similar to Zodiac in that sense yet more captivating. Even though I had seen the original film and knew most of the major plot points, I still found myself getting sucked into the story. Even if you hate this version of the film and your loyalty remains firmly with the Swedish film, you can probably at least agree that Fincher's version is visually the better of the two. The cinematography is just brilliant. You've gotten teases in the trailers, but the coldest winter in 20 years for Sweden looks so bloody fantastic on screen; the amazing scenery, those long drives through the snow, feeling like you're on the back of Lisbeth's motorcycle as she roars through a tunnel, and the inner shot of a plastic bag among many other things. The film is just a joy to look at from beginning to end.<br /><br />The score is also just as brilliant as the one for The Social Network, if not slightly better. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross seem to explore territory they didn't get to explore on The Social Network score. This one seems to feature more out of tune instruments, which is an interesting touch. The score hints at rising tension throughout the film always making you feel like there's always something else to the story lurking around the corner waiting for the right moment to strike. It's haunting, unnerving, and just spectacular overall.<br /><br />Noomi Rapace was an exceptional Lisbeth Salander and with that said so is Rooney Mara. Just the amount of devotion she put into the role with the piercings being genuine, bleaching her eyebrows, cutting her hair, learning how to ride a motorcycle, using a very convincing Swedish accent, coming off as being just as messed up as her appearance lets on, and being completely nude is an incredible accomplishment. It's not out of the question to believe that a role this physical could get her nominated for best actress at the Academy Awards. The entire cast just seems like they fit their roles a bit better than they did in the Swedish film. This is one of the only performances of Daniel Craig's I can actually say I enjoyed while Stellan Skarsg?rd is just wonderfully demented. Then there's Yorick van Wageningen that's just downright despicable as Nils Bjurman. It doesn't seem like it's something as simple as "oh, you're showing favoritism towards a remake because it's in English now." That isn't the case at all. Fincher's attention to detail to the source material is practically Kubrick-like. It shows in every frame of the film.<br /><br />Fincher's version also seems to feature a lot more of Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander being together. They have more sex and they're featured together more on-screen in comparison to the Swedish version. It was a nice addition that made the slightly altered ending a lot more impactful. The whistling doors in Martin's house were also amazing. I can't recall if that was in the Swedish version or not, but it brought a smile to my face with how something so small meant so much.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is obviously not going to be for everybody. It relies on extremely long discussions to drive most of the two and a half hour duration of the film. In between though, it becomes difficult to watch mostly with how Nils Bjurman handles giving Lisbeth more money and her response. Lisbeth's response will more than likely have you tiptoeing out of the theater as delicately as possible since you'll still be feeling it. With a phenomenal cast, incredibly rich cinematography, a brilliant score, and Rooney Mara's best performance to date, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is not only an improvement over the original but easily one of the best films of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JV4QKTEB7QBL.html">A1JV4QKTEB7QBL</a><br/><p>After viewing the fairly well-produced and well-adapted "Girl" trilogy of films (based on the Millennium novels by the late Stieg Larrson) by director Niels Arden Oplev, the question, "Why see yet another version of this same story?" (even if it is done in English, Hollywood style) may just cross one's mind especially in a diminished economy where frugality renders duplication superfluous.  However close to the perfection of the author's vision Noomi Rapace's performance might have been, Rooney Mara's incarnation of Lisbeth Salander seems more nuanced; she smolders with anger and vengeance like her predecessor, but withdraws in pretty silhouettes with a psychological vulnerability that endows her with even more antisocial magnetism and hints at the underbelly personal history yet to be revealed.<br /><br />Even though easy-on-the-eyes Daniel Craig, as the intrepid journalist Mikhal Blomkvist, more than adequately portrays the likeable character with a winning, almost unconscious self-consciousness, he conciliatorily fades into the background when Mara is on the screen.  As in the novel, Salander's edgy efficiency and genius works well against a backdrop of a seemingly well-oiled society equipped with high-speed trains and technology yet rotting from within with a moral corruptness that suggests repressed aggression.  Mara's face mirrors both Lisbeth's fierce rebellion and the forever scars she wears like a tattoo of resistant resilience.<br /><br />Director David Fincher deviates a bit from the gospel of the Larsson text--his Lisbeth admits her past openly to Blomkvist in a TMI scene that isn't true to the sensibility of the written character.  Perhaps, Fincher, worried about the reception of this English version and concerned about executing its sequels, reveals too much to accentuate Lisbeth's misplaced sense of betrayal regarding Blomkvist's limited yet open promiscuity. Perhaps, his perception of her desire to please Blomkvist with her openness and her body even after brutal sexual subjugation underlines her role as woman and her place despite her genius and injured sensibility. This is, after all, a novel, that in Europe tellingly goes by the Swedish title "M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor" which translates into English as "Men who hate women."  The novel's section headings are marked with statistics regarding the percentages of women brutalized by men which, along with key instances in the plotline describing women reduced to victim status due to the sadistic and masochistic actions of their supposed caretakers or loved ones, suggest that even with the seemingly blas&eacute; attitude regarding casual sexual relationships and equality amongst the sexes, there is indeed some disturbing issue that in this culture cannot be rectified by the actions of government or authority but by taking the matter into one's own very capable vigilante hands.<br /><br />In addition, rather than have the duo work together as in the novel to eventually reveal the initiator of a forty-year-old crime, Fincher chooses to film parallel sequences of enlightenment set to the fast-paced sound of European motorcycles and the edgy organic music of the Oscar-winning team of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.  This works to cut the overall time of what could have easily been a three-hour police procedural instead of a fascinating character study of an societal outcast and her soon-to-be crusading knight errant.<br /><br />Fincher misses a key flashback scene opportunity where Lisbeth stands and watches the killer die as his car bursts into flames.  Why not have his protagonist shudder with that remembrance from her own past and give the audience the thrill of mutual understanding?  For those non-novel readers, why not an anticipatory frisson of what is to come in the next two installments?  Maybe Fincher thought this would be a TMI moment.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Director David Fincher (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HWT6DO">The Social Network</a>) compacts Stieg Larsson's rambling novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015DROBO">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Millennium Trilogy)</a> into two hours and 38 minutes of intense film introducing to a mainstream English speaking audience the edgy pathology and survival of Dragon Girl--social misfit, rebel and genius, Lisbeth Salander.  Be warned the film contains violent rape, the depiction of a mutilated animal and stills of misogynistic torture.  The strength of Rooney Mara's portrayal of the lead character is more than enough reason to revisit this newer version.  Recommended.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>I remember the hype when Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy first became popular, so I was a bit surprised to see David Fincher's version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo perform somewhat badly in theaters. Did it underperform because the 2009 Swedish version satisfied people's desire to see the series on the big screen, or are people just tired of the whole thing?<br /><br />Before I talk about the movie, I have to mention the opening title sequence. It's just stunning. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross adapt Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song and give it a more modern feel. It perfectly sets the mood for what is to come.<br /><br />The story initially focuses on journalist Michael Blomkvist (Craig). We see him lose a libel case and most of his money in the process. He receives an offer from Henrik Vanger (Plummer) who offers to double his salary if he'll investigate who killed his granddaughter, Harriet. Blomkvist feels that he can't do the work alone and so he enlists the help of Lisbeth Salander (Mara), who was hired by one of Vanger's employees to investigate Blomkvist before the offer was made.<br /><br />It's here that the movie differs from the usual offerings within the crime investigation genre. The reason is Salander. She's easily the most interesting character in the story and is highly unconventional. She's considered unstable and perhaps insane and is monitored by a legal guardian. She's covered in piercings and tattoos and refuses to display any social skills whatsoever. Salander is deeply troubled and extremely hard to like when we first meet her.<br /><br />The movie isn't for everyone. It features a rape scene and another in which Salander is forced to perform sexual favors. Other scenes show torture, a dismembered animal and unpleasant photographs of murdered women.<br /><br />The story itself is a fairly straightforward search for the person who killed Harriet. We quickly learn that she wasn't the only victim. Salander has an eidetic memory and a gift for hacking into people's computers, while Blomkvist investigates in a more conventional way. They actually make a good team.<br /><br />The suspects are the other members of Henrik Vanger's extended family, so that's where the investigation begins. The running time is a little over two-and-a-half hours and it does lack momentum at times, but it was gripping enough to hold my interest throughout. Don't expect a huge amount of action, although the final act does include a few thrills.<br /><br />Many will compare Fincher's version to the Swedish version released in 2009. I own both and the difference between the two is minimal. There's slightly more urgency to the original version and it seems raw in comparison to Fincher's polished version. It's tricky buying into certain characters when the actor is known for other roles, and Craig's presence will remind most viewers of his role as James Bond. Indeed, he takes some events in stride as though they happen to him every day.<br /><br />The movie's appearance is somewhat bleak. The wintry scenes consist of a muted color palette with blacks, whites and grays dominating. The Blu-ray looks and sounds wonderful, and it's apparent that this version had a much bigger budget than the Swedish version.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the books, you'll likely be very happy with Fincher's adaptation. Mara was convincing as Salander and it's good to see how her character develops throughout the movie. She's slow to trust anyone, and that's understandable given what we know about her life and recent experiences. When someone does earn her trust, she's loyal and is somebody that you would want to be on your side.<br /><br />I enjoyed this first installment of the Millennium Trilogy, but it could have been better. Although box office numbers were mediocre at best, I think we'll eventually see the other two installments. Will Fincher direct? That remains to be seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>There's a moment in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (TGWTDT) where hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) seems to ask disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) for permission to commit murder.  That simple phrase sums up the perfect synchronicity of David Fincher's direction, Steven Zaillian's screenplay, and Trent Reznor's score. What kind of a woman asks for permission to kill?<br /><br />By now the plot of TGWTDT is well-known: When Blomkvsit, co-owner of Millennium magazine loses his libel case against corrupt CEO Hans-Erik Wennerstrom (Ulf Friberg), he is given an opportunity at redemption and revenge by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer). It's a good old fashioned murder mystery; Vanger is obsessed with solving the murder of his grandniece Harriet (Moa Garpendal).  And so, slinking out of the public eye, Blomkvist takes the job and moves onto the family's private island.<br /><br />Running parallel to Blomkvist's investigation is the tale of Salander. She is a product of the Swedish system, a ward of the state and abused product of the foster system. It doesn't take long before it becomes clear that Lisbeth is as much a ward as a victim; disaffected, detached, practical, and yes violent, she does what any man would do when facing abuse - she punches it in the face.  But because Lisbeth is a thin, pale girl with piercings all over her body, she is demonized and ostracized.  Lisbeth's greatest nemesis is Nils Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen), a corpulent, corrupt lawyer who manipulates Lisbeth into performing certain favors on him. And if you know Lisbeth you know this won't end well.<br /><br />Eventually these two plotlines converge.  Lisbeth provides much needed technical wizardry to Blomkvist's old school investigation. They are united by the opportunity to stop a "killer of women," a foe Lisbeth can certainly relate to.<br /><br />The crux of TGWTDT is the story of Lisbeth, of Harriet, of all the women who are routinely intimidated and subjugated by men who wield their power without restraint.  Their victims are merely foils, projections for each man's sins, and Lisbeth can't resist the opportunity to help a ghost from 40 years past get redemption.<br /><br />But back to that question.  It means so many things.  On one level, Lisbeth is still asking permission from men.  On the other, she doesn't need to ask anyone for permission for anything.  Lisbeth is certainly the most dangerous predator in the entire film. So why did she ask Blomkvist the question?<br /><br />I like to think it was a sign of affection, in the way a lover might ask, "Can I get you something to drink?" Or maybe it's a turn-taking request: "Were you planning on torturing him?" in the same way you might ask "Would you like to go first?" Mara's nuanced performance makes all the difference, and the fact that simple phrase can cause so much controversy is just one example of why The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an excellent film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>I did not feel as much of a compulsion to see the American version of 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo', as I did with the Swedish film. How could this newer version ever compare to the exquisite Swedish version? However, was there ever a more perfect Lisbeth than Rooney Mara, she completely won me over.<br /><br />In the Swedish version, we were given the bleak, white/black doomed version of the Swedish countryside and the personalities of its inhabitants. It seems they were good or evil. In the American film, Rooney Mara brings the isolation and complete vulnerability of Lisbeth. Maybe it was that in this version, Lisbeth's story is told from a different standpoint, it is her version without the complication of Mikael Blomkvist's character. We could feel her distance, emotionally and physically. She is alone, she isolates herself from her sexual partners as well as those who she deals with. Lisbeth does not smile, not does she make much of an expression at any time. Rooney Mara was able to take this character and give us this added dimension. It is not until she starts working with Mikael, who likes her and trusts her, that she will finally reveal some emotion, but it is not complete trust, nor should it be. It is Lisbeth's story that interests us. Mikael Blomkvist is interesting, but it is an added attraction. Daniel Craig did a great job, but he was missing the vulnerability and lack of confidence that I knew Mikael from the novel.<br /><br />This American version was so well done, that it had an edge in my book. What I did miss was the Swedish language and the sub titles, somehow they added to the mystery of these characters. Christopher Plummer was the perfect Henrik Vanger. Of course, Christopher Plummer is perfection in any of his roles. The other characters were well done and did not separate themselves in much fashion. I did not find Robin Wright as convincing as Erika Berger, she did not give off the sexuality that I felt from the Swedish version.<br /><br />This film stands alone as a great film, but it is Rooney Mara who makes this film. She is all of the superlatives, and I felt a deep connection to her character. I hope we see her again in the second and third version of the trilogy.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-24-12<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0070Z97LG">Dream House</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006K004FU">Tanner Hall</a></p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>I had no pre-conceptions when seeing this film.  I had not read any of the Stieg Larsson novels nor had I seen the earlier Swedish version of the film.  Obviously, I was aware of these versions.  However, I was perhaps wary that Hollywood was attempting to recreate something so soon after the original.<br /><br />Regardless, I thoroughly enjoyed "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo".  I found it to be dark, brooding and totally engrossing.  Time flew by.  I find that this is often one of the best indicators of a film's worth.<br /><br />The plot is probably well known to most.  I will not be repeating details nor, obviously, trying to compare it with the book or the original film.  Nonetheless, I can comment upon the cast and the broader screenplay.  In this regard, I found the lead actors to be excellent.  Rooney Mara as the rebellious and abused computer genius is a revelation.  She really does dominate the film.  Daniel Craig as the male lead, Mikael Blomkvist, is also good. This is not a James Bond role. He plays a real character with both strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />While the plot is arguably complex, it is easy for the viewer to follow. It has some wonderful twists.  All are explained without the viewer having to ask questions of others at the end of the production.<br /><br />Finally, the settings are also right on the money.  Mainly set in Sweden, the viewer is shown dark landscapes with little colour, These tie in nicely with the overall plot.  Nothing is out of place.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>I wasn't so sure about this movie, having seen the original trilogy, which I think is outstanding.  I'm not too big of a fan of remakes, often finding them disappointing knockoffs.<br /><br />That isn't the case here.  The story is riveting, with Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) dominating every scene, and rightly so.  Her character is connected to the mystery being solved, and the retribution that's dished out.<br /><br />Daniel Craig did a good job with his character, and took the appropriate 2nd seat to Lisbeth.<br /><br />This movie holds its own, and is no knockoff.<br /><br />It's not disappointing at all.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>So we all know that this was originally a Sweedish movie with English subtitles, right? And we all know that Director David Fincher simply re-did this American version of the film albeit with a completely different cast, right? And we all know that the movie(s) is based on the first of three books in a trilogy by Sweedish Author Stieg Larsson (RiP), right? And we all know that the original title of the book and movie were changed from Men Who Hate Women to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo so that it would be well received marketingwise in the US and not perceived as a bash against men by antisexism groups, right? And finally, we all know that two more films in the trilogy have already been released with the Sweedish cast (with less than positive reviews) and that Sony says the American cast has signed on for re-dos of the two sequels here in the US...right?<br /><br />Whew. With all that out of the way, I thought The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was very good. Two story lines woven together nicely. The first story line follows Journalist Mikael Blomkvist after being convicted of libel for accusing a high powered businessman of unethical and illegal activity. The widely publicized trial brings Blomkvist to the attention of another high powered businessman named Vanger who is looking for a long lost niece; Vanger thinks Blomkvist would be the perfect person to solve the mystery of his 40 years missing niece.<br /><br />Enter storyline 2: Vanger has hired a Goth lady named Lisbeth to determine if Blomkvist is the right man to hunt for his niece. And the story arcs from there to the struggles of Lisbeth's everyday life of trying to make ends meet while on probation for some crimes committed in her relatively distant past. Be warned, like the Swedish version, there are some scenes of rape and torture that are very unsettling and difficult to sit through in this film.<br /><br />Ultimately, both story lines are brilliantly connected with each other in a thriller tale of intrigue, deception, mystery, murder and revenge. It's a very good movie that stands on its own with no cliffhanger ending that requires seeing the upcoming sequels. Highly recommended but not for the squeamish.<br /><br />Having seen the original film I found myself involuntarily comparing Fincher's US version to the Sweedish version a few times during the film. And there was something about the original Sweedish version that made everything so much more real...especially Lisbeth, the character played by Rooney Mara. Fincher made Lisbeth somewhat of a, how should I say this?..."anti-superhero???" While Noomi Rapace played Lisbeth in the Sweedish version with a seriousness that made you think she was a real person out there somewhere, and that a camera followed her like a fly on the wall. Mara was good, but Rapace was great.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>I haven't seen the original Swedish film on which this English version is based, so my review is based purely on David Fincher's movie.<br />The movie is beautifully photographed, its snowy setting underscoring the chilling storyline.  Its intricate plot demands close attention, as does its deliberate, slow-paced first half.  The second half picks up once the titular character joins forces with the journalist to track down an elusive serial killer.  Rooney Mara shoots to stardom as the unconventional leading lady--a multi-pierced, tattooed, antisociable computer hacker--a role that garnered her a Best Actress Oscar nod.  Mara certainly dominates the film in her edgy, complex performance.  Daniel Craig is a competent, if unexciting, actor who suffers the James Bond curse---its hard to separate his 007 persona from his other roles.  I found it hard to be impressed with this performance as I did in his recent films like DREAM HOUSE and COWBOYS AND ALIENS.  Oscar winner Christopher Plummer, the always imposing Stellan Skarsgardm and the elegant Joely Richardson round out the supporting cast.  Yorick van Wanginingen as Mara's repulsive money manager is especially convincing.  The rape scenes are some of the most disturbing in recent cinema.<br />GIRL is definitely a commendable film, but its also quite revolting in its ugly storyline.  It's not easy to watch at times.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Trying to adapt a novel after it's already been done by someone else (and done well I might add) can be a challenge; do you make the same artistic choices? If not, what do you change in your approach to the film? David Fincher's version of Stieg Larrson's novel The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo is a rarity in Hollywood--it's a film that adapts the same source and is every bit as good (if not better) than the first version done.<br /><br />I'm not going to summarize the plot here--enough people have done that quite well. Instead, I'm going to focus on the image quality and special features for the Blu-ray set.<br /><br />This is a dark and foreboding film filled with a sense of dread early on (which isn't a surprise given that it's from the director of "Se7en" and "Fight Club"--I wouldn't count on Fincher ever tackling a light comedy).<br /><br />The transfer to Blu-ray is demo quality--blacks are inky and rich looking (particularly noticeable during the opening titles for the film)and detail remarkably sharp with unusually good depth as well.<br /><br />The sound is spectacular with a rich lossless presentation.<br /><br />We get an intelligent commentary track from Fincher discussing everything from the nuts and bolts of making the film to his approach to the material. Interestingly, Fincher was given the novel by producer Kathleen Kennedy before the original film version and Fincher (Kennedy gave it to him because she felt it fit his strengths as a film director) didn't read it at the time believing it would never be bought or opitoned by Hollywood nor that it would become a bestseller in the U.S.<br /><br />The bulk of the special features are on the second disc for the Blu-ray set.<br /><br />We also get exhaustive special features on the production of the film. "Characters" focuses on the three key characters of the film focusing on the casting with Lisbeth and Martin getting the Lion's share of featurettes (six)vs. a measely four for Blomkvist.<br /><br />We also get a variety of featurettes on shooting on location in Sweden and shooting in the U.S.--these run roughly 100 minutes on the disc. A four part documentary also highlights the post-production and ADR process for the film. There is also a very good featurette on the creation of the disturbing main titles (which reminded me of a very vivid, disturbing Bond-like opening sequence interesting since Daniel Craig stars in the film).<br /><br />The extras continue with a featurette on the promotional aspect of the film focusing on an "Inside Edition" styled TV program. It's both fascinating and hilarious as it manages to parody shows like "Inside Edition".<br /><br />The third disc is a DVD copy of the film which has artwork to make it look like a homemade DVD-R with the title written in black marker across the top (as if Lisbeth had made this bootleg herself). It's a clever touch. The only extra on the DVD is Fincher's commentary track.<br /><br />For those who hate Ultraviolet you can continue to hate it more as there is an Ultraviolet passcode included and that's the only "digital" copy available for this film to upload on your computer. My advice if you dislike Ultraviolet is (which has some severe limitations and issues for many people)is to carry around the DVD edition if you're going to watch it on your laptop (you're out of luck when it comes to an iPad or pad-like device as the Ultraviolet streaming edition is the only option and the coupon expires in 2013 on my copy).<br /><br />"The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo" remains a rarity; a film that adapts a foreign novel that was already made into a movie previously AND creates a dread-filled film that equals (and in my opinnion surpasses) the previous version of the film.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Let's face it: David Fincher's at his best when he's trying to creep us out.  He can give us a character-study drama about building an online empire (THE SOCIAL NETWORK), or a fantasy about Brad Pitt aging backwards for some reason (BENJAMIN BUTTON), but Fincher works best in the real of the thriller: SE7EN still remains (in this reviewer's opinion) his strongest, most fully-conceived film, with FIGHT CLUB and ZODIAC ranking pretty high up there.  THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO falls into this mind-freak category, with genuine thrills (even for those who've read the book and seen the original film), some solid performances, a fantastic script, incredible visuals and sound--basically, everything you've come to expect from a Fincher thriller.<br /><br />The plot is far from simple; as with the first film, this movie bogs down in the novel's convoluted story (following two protagonists, going back and forth in time, lingering on subplots that could easily have been trimmed).  It's basically the story of disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist (a subtle and engaging Daniel Craig), who is hired by billionaire Henrik Vanger (a regal Christopher Plummer, in the midst of a late-career resurgence) to solve the decades' old murder of his niece.  Along the way, Blomkvist recruits tough-but-vulnerable girl Lisabeth Salander (a very capable, occasionally surprising Rooney Mara) who has a knack for computer hacking and revenge.<br /><br />DRAGON TATTOO, for you newcomers, is basically what THE GODFATHER would have been if it were a techno-thriller-mystery.  Which probably makes no sense.  That's okay; you'll either love this film for its pseudo-gothic vibes, or hate it for its forced overtones of darkness.  One thing everyone can agree on are the performances, from the two leads to the stellar supporting cast: Robin Wright, Stellan Skarsgard, Joely Richardson, even the grossly-overlooked Julian Sands in a wordless flashback role (talk about wasted talent, but he makes the most of it).  The script, too, is top-notch; Steve Zaillan's penned everything from MONEYBALL to GANGS OF NEW YORK, and he still keeps finding new tricks up his sleeve.  Kudos must also be heaped upon Fincher's ever-reliable cohort Trent Reznor, for providing a killer soundtrack.  (Oh, and at least watch the film for the opening credits sequence; think Bond in Hell.)<br /><br />Stieg Larsson's original novel was a very well-written and engaging tome, if a bit overlong and meandering (it could have been half its length and still been okay); the American film version trims the fat a little (it's still over 2.5 hours long), but falls to many of the same inconsistencies.  Why, then, the five stars?  Because of the way Fincher and company overcome the challenges.  It's not a crime classic in the way that SE7EN is, and probably never will be.  But there's a lot here to love (or hate, as many will, for a wide variety of reasons, many of them legitimate), and for Fincher's growing legions of fans, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO will go down as a particular favorite.</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) wants to solve the 40 year old disappearance/murder of his 16 year old niece. He enlists the help of investigative reporter Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) who thinks he is on to something. He needs an assistant and employs the talents of Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) in the title role. Lisabeth is a savvy psychotic bisexual computer hacker/investigator who provides us with a dark bizarre subplot.<br /><br />During the investigation they uncover hints that point to a serial killer, who kills Jewish women based on quotes from Leviticus. The mystery isn't too hard to figure out with the numerous clues that they give you. The movie is best when Rooney Mara is on the screen.<br /><br />F-bomb, rape, sex, nudity (Rooney Mara)</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Whether you call it a remake of the 2009 Swedish film or an American adaptation of the novel, this English-language version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has arrived. In the interest of simplicity, I'll refer to it as a remake hence forth. The books by Stieg Larsson are quite popular in America and the Swedish films have been seen by a pretty wide American audience given their foreign nature. I have never read Larsson's books, but I've seen all three of the Swedish films based on them. The films, particularly the first one, are so accessible to the average American moviegoer and are so widely available that an American version just seemed strange and unnecessary. When David Fincher, riding the wave of universal acclaim from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HWT6DO">The Social Network</a>, signed on to direct and cast up-and-coming actress Rooney Mara as the iconic Lisbeth Salander, my doubts were lessened. The announcement that newly minted Oscar-winners Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross would collaborate with Fincher to again provide the score didn't hurt either. There is no use comparing Fincher's version with Niels Arden Oplev's. It's not exactly apples and oranges, but it accomplishes nothing. It's a more effective measure to analyze this on its own merit rather than nitpick and compare every aspect with the film that came before it. Fincher's style is so prevalent that it's easy to believe he didn't take any inspiration from the previous adaptation, having adopted a style and tone for the film that is all his own. If he goes on to direct the sequels, the overall atmosphere alone will make them easy to distinguish from the versions before it. Additionally, I won't say one is better than the other for several reasons. One is that this version is much fresher in my mind and another is my feeling that this version loses an edge because of my familiarity with the story. A lot of suspense or mystery that may have been handled more effectively here may have been lost on me. Regardless, I'll get on with it.<br /><br />The film quickly sets the tone with Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) receiving a framed drawing of a flower at his home on Hedeby Island. The screen goes dark, Trent Reznor's atmospheric rendition of Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song starts in, and the stylized, gritty opening credit sequence begins, hearkening back to Fincher's earlier career directing music videos. Enter Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), writer and co-owner of Millennium Magazine, who fears he has ruined his reputation after losing a libel case to a wealthy businessman. Meanwhile, lawyer Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff) has commissioned an extensive background check on Blomkvist from Lisbeth Salander, a computer hacker and researcher for a security firm. Her report convinces Frode to introduce Blomkvist to his client Henrik Vanger. Impressed with his investigative reporting skills, Henrik wants Blomkvist to help him solve the 40-year-old murder of his niece Harriet under the guise of helping him write his memoirs. Though a body has never been uncovered, Henrik is convinced that his niece was murdered by someone in his own family. Everyone on the island is suspect and Henrik makes Blomkvist an offer he can't refuse.<br /><br />The film jumps back and forth between Blomkvist and Salander, who don't team up until quite late into the movie. With a runtime of 160 minutes, there's no real need to rush anything. There's a very memorable, graphic scene in the Swedish version that involves Salander, her guardian, and a tattoo gun. I recall watching this scene, knowing an American version was in the works, and being flabbergasted by it. There was no way I could fathom that scene being depicted in a mainstream American film. The American version of Let the Right One In was too afraid to recreate a single shot for American audiences (if you've seen both versions, you should know the shot), so how was Fincher going to get away with this? To my surprise, he did get away with it and this harrowing, graphic torture scene is just one example of his refusal to sanitize the violent and sexual nature of the film. He promised this would be a hard `R' and he delivered. Never before have I seen an R-rated film and thought `how is this not NC-17?' To see this content play on a movie screen in a large, corporate theatre is a validation of what driven, stubborn directors can do with total control over their vision. A lot of the graphic nudity and violence depicted here in unheard of in a mainstream American film. You'd be lucky if you could find some of this stuff at your local art house theater.<br /><br />Since Fight Club, Fincher has adopted a unique style that becomes more developed with each passing film. There are several scenes here where he goes full-Kubrick, mastering his grip over the sinister and the ominous. I bring up Kubrick because Fincher has become adept at creating a disconnected atmosphere that casts a spell over the audience. Fincher and cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth give The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo a dark and grungy, yet sophisticated look that takes advantage of Sweden's weather to lend itself to the overall atmosphere. This atmosphere is most potent in flashback scenes, creating a whole separate mood. There are some incredible shots here that should bring Cronenweth richly deserved awards recognition, as this one of the most well shot movies of the year.<br /><br />Reznor and Ross deliver a score that actually heightens the effect of the material, moving in such perfect sync with the film that they become codependent with one another. I was not as impressed as I was with their work on The Social Network, but it may just have been more subtle or lacked the same freshness. Whatever the case, these two have the potential to do great things for movie music. It comes as no surprise that Fincher has wrangled terrific performances from his cast. Craig makes a great Blomkvist, assured, but not too arrogant. It's a great example of his acting range, as he effortlessly transitions from the fearless James Bond to the confused Blomkvist. Stellan Skarsg?rd as Martin Vanger...Damn. An actor with plenty of work under his belt in two countries, he deserves more roles of this sort.<br /><br />Finally, there's the controversial casting of Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. Noomi Rapace's earlier performance became so closely associated with the character that people would have been up in arms if she had reprised the role herself. Mara made a big impression with her brief scenes in The Social Network, but this performance shows what she's really capable of. It's a remarkable transformation and she's in total command of the screen when she's on it. With her beauty completely obscured under the strange hair, piercings, and makeup; she's tough, troubled, and fascinating. She's occasionally sexy too, but this comes not from physical attributes, but the confidence in her performance. I'd have to watch the two performances in close proximity to say for sure, but Mara may give a more psychologically complex performance that Rapace. Her performance is brilliant.<br /><br />Fincher knows of his talent and this film is a more assured directorial effort, especially in regards to his ability at handling drama, suspense, violence, mystery, etc. His talent has made The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo stand as its own film. That's not to say it's perfect, with an epilogue that seems to stretch a bit too long. However, the final scene, a new addition, wraps everything up and has more bite than the Swedish version, making this one pack a more emotional wallop. It's an enthralling film that has carved a place on my top ten for the year, a welcome and different breed from the typical film to find its way onto such a list. The story is a high-minded mystery yarn, tailor-made for this century that would not be the success it is without its memorable female protagonist and the talented filmmakers bringing the story to life. Unlike most of the year's best films, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is little more than supreme, well-made entertainment. I'll be surprised if it's nominated for any Academy Awards beyond acting, directing, photography, and music. Its status as a remake certainly won't help it receive additional accolades. Fortunately, I had high hopes for this and it totally delivered. I hope Fincher goes on to direct the next two installments so I can see what else he has to offer the series. It may not be a "great movie" in the traditional sense, but it has all the cinematic ingredients of one, coupled with great entertainment and potent atmosphere. It's nice to see a potential franchise unabashedly geared for adults. I hesitate to call it "one of the best films of the year," but The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is one of my favorite films of the year and is more of an achievement on a cinematic level than many of the films superior to it.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>Last year, the Swedish version of Stieg Larsson's novel of the same name was my favorite movie of the year.  I know, it was released in 2009, but in my area it hit theaters in 2010.  In any case, it was and is a great film.  How could it be improved and why would an American director want to try?  I was very skeptical.  American filmmakers don't usually improve on originals, but there are some exceptions.  Ironically, a recent re-do from Sweden is another example.  I loved "Let the Right One In", but thought "Let Me In" was a modest improvement.<br /><br />Director David Fincher pulls it off here as well.  There are differences between the two films but they are not substantive.  What is different is the production value.  More on that in a minute.  The opening pushes you back in your seat with Led Zeppelin's "The Immigrant Song" covered by Karen O and Trent Reznor.  It plays over a series of fluid steel grey images.  It's hard to describe, but it gets your attention.  The plot differs little from the previous movie and presumably the novel (which I haven't read).  The editor of a Swedish magazine is found guilty of liable based on questionable journalism.  His finances are decimated and his magazine is in jeopardy of going under.  Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig at his best), needing income accepts the position of biographer for one of Sweden's wealthiest men and the head of a family that includes former Nazi's in its ranks.<br /><br />Mikael's real job however is to find out what happened to the niece of the ranking family head (Christopher Plummer).  The niece who was 16 at the time of her disappearance in the mid-1960's, is believed to have been murdered and Henrik (Plummer) believes family members were responsible.  He wants Mikael to investigate.  Needing help he hires Lisbeth Salander (award-worthy Rooney Mara) who had been recommended by the family's attorney.  Mikael is unaware that she had been doing a background investigation on him as part of Henrik's vetting process.<br /><br />Mara jumps into this role with both feet, as well as other body parts, and is remarkable.  She brings a smoldering fury to the character that has sociopathic tendencies, the result of abuse as a child.  We don't know the details (next movie) but it's there.  Lisbeth is a bi-sexual wisp of a young woman.  Body piercings are in seen and unseen places, she is covered in tattoos, has a spiked haircut, bleached eyebrows and dresses in black leather (goes with her motorcycle).  It's hard not to be distracted by this exterior, but later in the film Lisbeth takes on another identity, that of a beautiful blond rich socialite and Mara pulls that off too.<br /><br />The reason the film is so noteworthy is the detail.  Set in Sweden using a mixture of European and American English speaking actors, it's hard to differentiate between native Swedes and others.  The photography is astounding.  The film jumps between urban Stockholm and a remote island, 4 hours away by train.  The film has some brutal violence, not the least of which is rape of Lisbeth by her "guardian."  This is tough to watch but if you appreciate revenge, just wait.  Another modification Fincher made involves the relationship between Mikael and Lisbeth.  To put it bluntly they have more sex.  Their relationship is warming.  There is a real connection.  You can see Lisbeth changing.  She's feeling better about herself.  Mikael?  He's had a long romantic relationship with his publisher Erika (Robin Wright) and it appears that hasn't changed.  Lisbeth's long disappearance in the next film will make more sense.  Earlier I mentioned the opening song, I should add that Reznor and Atticus Ross wrote the music for this film and it fits the scenes perfectly.  This is a brilliant, well made movie with some outstanding performances and is at the top of my list for 2011.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>I saw it twice.

This sparked a mixed reaction, from people who even love Fincher like there's no tomorrow. Well, it looks like people are still high off their wankery over The Social Network, another mediocre and spectacularly overrated movie. So it seems obvious the circle jerk would continue in the wake of the recent Dragon Tattoo adaptation.<br /><br />Problem is, there seems to be Two David Finchers. The one who made amazing movies Like Se7en, The Game, Fight Club, Panic Room and The Zodiac. Then there's the Fincher who gave us the horrid Benjamin Button, the overrated above mentioned Social Network, and now this.<br /><br />Thing is, I for one wasn't too opposed the idea of an English language adaptation. I mean, sure it wouldn't be as authentic as the original Swedish version, nor the book. But it could still work. Craig still had the face and Mara has very striking facial features. Reznor has a unique way of scoring a film, and Fincher has a great eye for a shot, hell, he practically made a whole career our of that kind of thing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie is nowhere near as interesting as the Swedish movie. And here's why.<br /><br />The Swedish movie does a good job at staying close to the source material, however, it doesn't just mindlessly piggyback off of the source material- it perfectly balanced everything out. Those who haven't read the book would be able to follow it and find it entertaining. It took its time too- it had a nice, steady, easy going pace. It was 2.5 hours, but the movie was so interesting, it went by fast and you couldn't tell.<br /><br />The Yank version is pretty much an exact adaptation of the book, yes. Pretty much 98% of the book was in the movie. That's NOT a good thing; to me it came off as nothing more than desperate to please the fans. It was like Zallian said "Alright, we have to mindlessly piggyback the book. I'm super scared of pissing the fans off, and so let's not edit anything down. There is no such thing as 'What may work on page doesn't necessarily work on film.'". Except... there is.<br /><br />Let me explain why.<br /><br />Niels' film showed RESTRAINT and SUBTLETY, the two things this film lacked. It focused more on the characters than every single tiny little plot device of the book. This film felt rushed and blew its way through everything. For example, the opening scene. In Niels' film, it's very powerful. The way he looks at the plant then breaks down is simply... stunning. Here? We got a half assed phone call and a shot of the plant.<br /><br />The opening credits, however, are class. Pointless, overly flashy and a bit gimmicky? Yes, but class, and the images fit very nicely over the Immigrant Song. I loved the shout outs to the sequels too.<br /><br />Unfortunately it stops there, the writer Zallian is so obsessed with capturing every event that he senselessly skips over CHARACTER DETAILS!!!!! We get no hint to the fact that Lisbeth is possibly autistic. Instead we get a scenery chewing girl who we want to punch in the face every time we see her. The whole libel thing goes over our heads completely too.<br /><br />And that's just the beginning.<br /><br />Several of the scenes are over before they even begin. It's frustrating. The rape scene was underwhelming even. In the book it was a disturbing and powerful scene. Here it's just a "lol wut" moment.<br /><br />As for the acting. Noomi Rapace simply cannot be replaced. She played Lisbeth exactly how the books describe her. Tough as nails, arrogant, and dangerous to herself, but with an air of special childlike innocence. Mara? She confuses good acting for chewing the scenery. She always glares and says every line like someone asked her the square root of an insanely large number. Nyqvist not only played Blomkvist just like Larsson wrote him, but he also LOOKED like the book described. Here, Craig just seems to be stuck in his Bond phase. Nothing special whatsoever.<br /><br />Also, for parts 2 and 3, someone needs to hire a better dialect coach. I lost count of all the times they went from American to British to a Europeanoid accent. What a joke.<br /><br />I wish I could recommend this, but it's a big mess. Avoid if you haven't watched the Swedish and just watch that instead.<br /><br />Fincher, thou hast ruined Lisbeth Salander for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>I heart Lisbeth Salander!<br /><br />Take this from someone who never read Stieg Larsson's books or saw the original Swedish version of this movie: Dragon Tattoo rocks!<br /><br />The film is basically a murder mystery. Forty years ago, in 1966, a 16-year-old girl disappeared without a trace from a large, wealthy Swedish family. A recently-disgraced journalist (Daniel Craig) is approached by the girl's uncle (Christopher Plummer) to look into the case. The case is complex because though the girl's relatives all live on a small island, some are reclusive ex-Nazis and the rest are not talking to each other. Meanwhile, back in the city, Lisbeth Salander -- a young  punk girl, tattooed and pierced -- is undergoing her own difficulties with the social welfare system. She is anti-social, lesbian and tough, but a heck of a hacker and researcher. The movie takes off when she (played by an Oscar-worthy Rooney Mara) and Craig team up to crack the case.<br /><br />The film is dark, edgy and very rough. Shot in monochromes, it exudes a sense of cold and isolation that matches the spirit of its characters. The plot contains very frank depictions of sexual abuse and rape, and the dialog is rough as well. This makes the characters, especially Lisbeth's, very real and multi-faceted. Lisbeth is one of the darkest heroines to emerge from a fiction writer's pen. She is small and fragile, with nearly translucent skin and an air of fatalism. Yet she is strong and resourceful, capable of outwitting her victimizers with a (perhaps) put-on madness that nears psychotic levels. Not a young lady to be tampered with.<br /><br />Great film, even if the Plummers and Craigs can't match Mara's soul-seared intensity.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>The 2011 American version of "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is an exquisitely crafted, hard-hitting movie, based on the best-selling Swedish novel.  On the surface, it is a cold case murder mystery, resurrected by a dying man and a disgraced journalist.  It is much more than that, a tense and often terrifying voyage into human darkness that may stay with the viewer for awhile.<br /><br />"Tattoo" offers superb location shooting in Stockholm and on a Swedish island, with the winter darkness seemingly pursuing the characters indoors.  The excellent casting features Daniel Craig as investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist, Christopher Plummer as the dying industrialist who wants to learn the fate of a long-missing niece, and Skellan Skarsgard as the nephew who encourages both men, for his own reasons.  However, the movie is stolen by Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander, an abused and twisted but supremely effective computer hacker and investigator who assists Blomkvist.<br /><br />At 158 minutes, this is a long movie, yet the pacing and dialogue maintain the tension throughout.  The story tracks the separate and rather unhappy lives of Blomkvist and Salander until they intersect in the pursuit of the missing girl and her presumed murderer.  Following a thin, 40 year-old trail of clues, Mikael and Lisbeth form a touching and almost haunting alliance.  This reviewer had not read the novel and so was not prepared for the terrifying solution to the mystery of the missing girl, or the movie's multiple endings.<br /><br />"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is very highly recommended as a well-done movie with impact.  It is for adults only, not least for the disturbing violence visited on Lisbeth early in the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Mikael Blomkvist is a financial reporter determined to restore his honor after being convicted of libel. Engaged by one of Sweden's wealthiest industrialists, Henrik Vanger, to get to the bottom of the long-ago disappearance of his beloved niece, Harriet -- murdered, Vanger believes, by a member of his large family -- the journalist heads to a remote island on the frozen Swedish coast, unaware of what awaits him. At the same time, Lisbeth Salander, an unusual but ingenious investigator with Milton Security, is hired to do a background check on Blomkvist, a job that ultimately leads to her joining Mikael in his investigation of who killed Harriet Vanger. Though Lisbeth shields herself from a world that has repeatedly betrayed her, her hacking skills and single-minded focus become invaluable. While Mikael goes face-to-face with the tight-lipped Vangers, Lisbeth plies the wired shadows. They begin to trace a chain of homicides from the past into the present, forging a fragile strand of trust even as they are pulled into the most savage currents of modern crime.<br /><br />The cast led by Daniel Craig (as Mikael Blomkvist) & Rooney Mara (terrific as Lisbeth Salander) is excellent. The directing by David Fincher is excellent. The screenplay (based on Stieg Larsson's novel) by Steven Zaillian (also executive produced) is excellent.<br /><br />The music by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross is excellent. The cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth is excellent. The film editing by Kirk Baxter & Angus Wall is excellent. The casting by Laray Mayfield is excellent. The production design by Donald Graham Burt is excellent. The art direction by Frida Arvidsson, Linda Janson, Pernilla Olsson, Tom Reta, Kajsa Severin & Mikael Varhelyi is excellent. The set decoration by K.C. Fox is excellent. The costume design by Trish Summerville is excellent.<br /><br />This is an excellent and well-crafted film that keeps you on the edge of your seat with your mind thinking and your heart racing. It is also a well-paced and well-made film that is faithful, not only to the novel, but the original Swedish language film, which this is a terrific companion to. Rooney Mara gives a terrific, career-making performance as Lisbeth and she and Daniel Craig have a great chemistry together. This is one of the best films of the winter-holiday season and of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Despite any reservations a viewer might have about a prompt English version re-make of a very successful Swedish film still popular in this country - the first novel in author Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, namely GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO - this version of Larsson's story is immensely successful.  Much of that is due to the tightly woven screenplay by Steven Zaillian and the extraordinary direction by one of our most gifted directors, David Fincher (Fight Club, The Social Network, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Seven, etc). But also the gifts of the musical composers Trent Reznor and Atticus  Ross (with a bit of help from a very well placed Morten Lauridson's `Lux Aeterna') and the bitingly vivid cinematography of Jeff Cronenweth. Add to that one of the finest collection of actors ever to collaborate on a project and the result is a film that is so engrossing that its very long length doesn't seem long enough!<br /><br />Everyone knows the story by now: disgraced journalist, Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), escapes to an island in Sweden at the request of Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to investigate the 40 year absence of his niece Harriet. The Vanger family is as dysfunctional and bitterly cruel an ensemble as could be imagined and everyone on the island wants Mikael to leave.  The case fascinates Mikael and he gains access to the services of an associate, the very bizarre and brilliant pierced, tattooed, punk computer hacker named Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara). As they work together in the investigation, Blomkvist and Salander uncover immense corruption beyond anything they have ever imagined. There are indelible characters along the way: the disgustingly sadistic Nils Bjurman (a brilliant role for Yorick van Wageningen) who mistakenly sexually abuses Lisbeth who in turn has her own manner of revenge), the wily Martin Vanger (Stellan Skarsg?rd), a brief but impressive Dragan Armansky (Goran Visnjic), Anita Vanger (Joely Richardson), Inspector Morelli (Donald Sumpter) etc etc etc.  Every role is cast so carefully that there is never a missed beat in this huge ensemble.<br /><br />For those who love the Swedish version of GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO this English version will surely satisfy.  They are different but for this viewer the English version is far more memorable.  There is considerable frank sexual activity, torture, animal abuse, and there are some gruesome scenes: they add and must be there.  Kudos to all concerned. And yes, Rooney Mara really is that fine!

Her demeanour is icy cold and at times vicious, yet this is simply a shield of protection from the abuse she has suffered. At first Blomkvist learns of her as a faceless person who hacked into his life at the request of Henrik Vanger's security advisor, yet Salander and Blomkvist come together as research partners. The mystery of Harriet becomes their project and they uncover the shocking truth at the risk of their own safety.<br /><br />Rooney Mara gives an explosive performance as Lisbeth Salander, and Daniel Craig is warm yet quite steely as Mikael Blomkvist. The entire cast present unique and convincing characters.<br /><br />The film is at times graphic and contains themes which may dislodge some viewers from their seat, with a sensational narrative that engages the viewer in a search for the truth.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author</p></br><a href="../users/A3APW42N5MRVWT.html">A3APW42N5MRVWT</a><br/><p>My experience of the American film version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307949486">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a> can't help but be influenced by the powerful experience of the earlier Swedish film. There is much to recommend each. There are choices in each film that I prefer over the other.<br /><br />David Fincher's American film is more slickly and confidently made but, perhaps because the story was familiar already, had less of an emotional impact that the rougher and rawer Swedish film. The American version of the investigation seemed too easy and, as good an actor as he is, Daniel Craig just carries too great an aura of physical competence to convincingly portray Mikael Blomkvist.<br /><br />Rooney Mara's Lisbeth Salander is distinct from but just as good as Noomi Rapace's. We experience less of Lisbeth Salander's world in the American film, mostly to the detriment of my investment in her story, but Fincher and Co. do leave out some information which was shoehorned into the Swedish film from later books in the series which was probably better left for later. Good call on that.<br /><br />And the American film has Stellan Skarsg?rd; always a good thing. Still, I think my preference falls to the Swedish <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TTWJJO">The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</a>. Or better yet, I can just mash them up in my imagination and have the best of both.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>This is an interesting story, but the 2009 version was just fine in it's original version from Sweden. I see many people on here talking about how this is different from the first film. I have seen both of these back to back and I can't see the need to remake it.  It is virtually scene for scene the same as the original, and the quality of the film used, sound, and lighting even feel the same, if not worse.  The only thing they did was bring in bigger actors, namely Daniel Craig, Stellan Skarsgard, Christopher Plummer to name a few, then made them speak English with an accent to make it sound Swedish to apparently make it more appealing for the US audience.  Also had a bigger budget, but all they spent it on was actors and trent rezonor to do the soundtrack, just superfluous spending that added nothing for me.  Really no need to do so.  I watched the original with subtitles, and the English overdub was not bad when I tried it.  Again, interesting enough movie, worth a viewing if you are a fan of the series, but don't get your hopes up for something different or better.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XT8AJB7S9JJG.html">A1XT8AJB7S9JJG</a><br/><p>"I want you to help me catch a killer of women."

He receives help from the eccentric Lisbeth Salander (Mara) who has her own motives. I had contradicting feelings going into this one. I really loved the original (I haven't read any of the books though) but I was worried about how this one would be but was very excited to see it. I though the casting was perfect but the original Lisbeth was so tremendous that I couldn't see how this could be as good. One of the first things I noticed was how similar Mara looked to the original actress. As the movie went on I started seeing more and more similarities to the original. I realize that this is based off a book so they will be similar but this to me felt like almost a shot for shot remake. It's been a while since I saw the original but it felt like almost the exact same thing. All that said though the original seemed better to me, I don't know what this was missing but I don't think it was as good. I did like this movie though. Overall, not as good as original but very close. I give it a B.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is humiliated for writing a story in his magazine that causes him to lose a libel lawsuit in court.

There are some changes to the movie but it substantially follows the original closely. The acting is superb and Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig are just marvelous in this movie.  If you like the original then you will love this one also.<br /><br />Just be aware that there is graphic violence and gruesome murder photos in the movie as well as sex and rape. If this is not your type of movie then be warned.<br /><br />This movie is every bit as good as the original and they are both 5 Star movies!</p></br><a href="../users/A2BFIYZYNK54QX.html">A2BFIYZYNK54QX</a><br/><p>Now, just a few years ago, the world was taken by storm by the Swedish-language film adaptation of this incredibly successful book (which I have not read yet), and the world was taken similarly by storm by Noomi Rapace, playing the intense, fierce and wholly independent Lisbeth Salander. It's a good film with a great performance by Rapace, and that has translated to high profile roles in English-Speaking cinema now, with a major role in the most recent SHERLOCK HOLMES film and the main character in this summer's upcoming PROMETHEUS.<br /><br />Now, aside from a few films (PANIC ROOM and THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON), David Fincher has always hit the mark (SE7EN, THE GAME, THE SOCIAL NETWORK, FIGHT CLUB), or came as close as he could (ALIEN 3). Like all of his great films, this is a film packed with amazing performances, and like all of his great films, there's one performance that over-shadows all the others, and with this film, it's Rooney Mara, again as Salander. However, the major difference between the Swedish film and the English film (other than the different languages) is the power of the film. Where I was left feeling somewhat empty after viewing the Swedish version, I felt totally fulfilled by Fincher's film, adapted by Steven Zaillian, one of Hollywood's premier wordsmiths, and performed with versatility and power by its cast, again with Mara at the forefront, but other than the rather forgettable supporting performances by the Swedish film's cast, such as Michael Nyquist playing a too-stilted Mikael Blomkvist, here for the part of Blomkvist, we have Daniel Craig, who is a far superior actor to Nyquist, and shows the versatility, charm and intelligence of the role. I feel that Craig was pretty short-changed as far as any of the acclaim of the film is concerned, as was Stellan Skarsgaard, playing Martin Vanger with great skill. Also short-changed is Fincher's skill as a director. While I didn't really care for ALIEN 3 as a whole, I felt that Fincher had an interesting enough vision, and he more than exceeded my expectations for that vision with SE7EN, which is strangely kind of a companion piece to this film. But if anything, Fincher's skill behind the camera has only grown since then, and this film shows him possibly as his height as he manages to make this a whole and complete film that can stand alone, despite the two other parts of Larsson's MILLENIUM trilogy. Hopefully, Sony Pictures will look at the eventual returns of this film that include home video sales and will conclude that Fincher, Mara and Craig should return for the sequels.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SLA0SXRQV8M0.html">A2SLA0SXRQV8M0</a><br/><p>A Hollywood remake of a Swedish movie made just two years ago, is the first part of the best selling trilogy Millennium, by the late Swedish author (and journalist) Stieg Larsson. The plot is mostly about how investigative journalist Michael Blomkvist (clearly an alter ego of Larsson) is asked by Henrik Vanger, an aging captain of industry to solve the murder of his favorite niece forty years ago. By some strange circumstances, he will be helped in the investigation by the pierced, troubled hacker Lisbeth Salander, with whom professional cooperation will soon turn into the personal as they discover the very dark secrets running under the very successful Vanger family. The Hollywood version is also set in Sweden, though here all the characters speak in English.<br /><br />As much as I like the original movie (I haven't read the books) I must admit that its view of the world is a bit naive, equivalent to an earnest teenager shouting that the whole world is corrupt. In the US version, Blomkvist is played by Daniel Craig (a fine actor who has made a career playing macho guys) as a stronger and more attractive man than in the Swedish movie (where he was played by the older and somewhat chubby Michael Nyqvist). On the other hand, the Lisbeth Salander character is played in the remake by Rooney Mara as a weaker woman than in the original (she might be a fine actress, but she doesn't show it here, despite critical acclaim for her performance). Noomi Rapace made a far stronger impression as Lisbeth in the Swedish movie.<br /><br />Though there are not major changes in the movie plot, the Hollywood version does make small variations, which I think are generally for the worse. For instance, when Craig tries to understand the meaning of certain numbers that might be a clue to the murder, his daughter, who is a fervent catholic going to a religious camp, alerts him that they are a biblical reference. This scene is unlikely, since there are very few Catholics in Sweden, or very religious people for that matter, as it is a very secular country. In the original version, the character of the daughter does not appear, and is Lisbeth, by surfing in the net, that finds the religious connections.<br /><br />The director is David Fincher. He has occasionally made fine movies (for instance, Zodiac) but most of the time his work tend to the flashy and empty (Seven, Fight Club), the overrated (The Social Network) if not to the directly mediocre (Benjamin Button). This movie is not totally worthless, but it is disappointing, and it is considerably weaker than the original version.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QH6BEY6RYQR0.html">A3QH6BEY6RYQR0</a><br/><p>A man who works as a journalist is asked to investigate the disappearance of a woman in the 60's. He teams with Lisbeth Salander, a woman who, let's just say, is very unique. She is a computer hacker who early on in the film takes revenge on a man who brutally rapes her. The two are working together to solve the mystery of Harriet, who mysteriously vanished years ago. The film is technically outstanding, well-acted, and it maintains the realism and brutality of the rape and revenge scenes involving Lisbeth Salander. Unfortunately, the movie is overlong due to an unnecessary revenge sequence involving a businessman that the journalist had been convicted of libeling. With David Fincher at the helm, I expected a great film, but what I saw was merely a good one.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I don't why I wanted to see this. I've never read the book or seen the original Swedish movie. I know they wanted to establish character development for Daniel Craig's character, Mikael, and Lisbeth Salander but it took forever for something interesting to finally happen. The film is told by two story lines at first, then finally meet up at about 90 minutes in. First off, I thought Daniel Craig's storyline was a little boring. He's asked by a man named Henrik to solve the murder of his niece that happened 40 years earlier. (You can have a drinking game when Daniel Craig puts his glasses on and takes them off every time he finds another piece of the puzzle) Then we have Rooney Mara's hot awkward Gothic character, Lisbeth Salander. I loved her storyline and her character. She is the only good thing about this movie. She's a computer hacker that deals with mental issues and rape. Later in the movie, she becomes Mikael's assistant in finding a murderer. I probably wouldn't recommend THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AHL35XZ3OND2Z.html">AHL35XZ3OND2Z</a><br/><p>Having read all the books years ago, the story itself really never did anything for me. It's really all about Salander. Fincher did a competent if procedural job. The main complaint here is he rushes through the flat pages of dialog with no pause or rhythm at all. Many scenes involve the actors simply going through motions reciting their memorized lines with few touches of humanity.<br /><br />Neither movie is more than a cheap Saturday scare and to sum it up, put the cast from the Swedish film in one directed by Fincher and you've got the real deal. The most telling contrast in both movies that show where they stand is in the scene where Salander and Blomkvist are lying in bed toward the end and the writer muses to his ass kicking hacker about what she has been through. In one movie, the scene is quiet and human and the other movie, it's simply filler to the next scene. I fault Steve Zaillian's simplistic screenplay more than anything else. The Swedish one wisely compresses and simplifies many of the novels blatant flaws, while the Gringo version keeps all the boring warts.  Let's not ignore a "new" ending that requires an extraordinary suspension of disbelief or complete incompetence on the part of everybody else in the plot.<br /><br />Rooney Mara does a good, if robotic job playing Larsen's motorcycle driving Goth, hacker, sex pot, but I kept looking for the one and only Noomi Rapace at every turn. Hard act to follow. Either in writing or how she was directed, Mara's Salander plays more of a young girl in love with older man, than the distant cautious (and damaged) Salander of Rapace - which is rightly or wrongly, more in line with the book and frankly more realistic. i'm not taking anything away from Rooney Mara's work, she was brave and really good. I just prefer Noomi Rapace's interpretation.<br /><br />Also WTF? with the James Bond intro?

Lisbeth tells her past to Mikal. Martin denied killing Harriet; could she still be alive? They visit Anita in London, who tells them about her past. The mystery is solved, Harriet returns to speak to Henrik Vanger. Lisbeth tells Mikal the secrets of Wennerstr&ouml;m's past; this time the charges will stick. Lisbeth borrows 50,000 for her work. She will repay it as she has the passwords to transfer funds from Wennerstr&ouml;m's banking accounts. Wennerstr&ouml;m is now a hunted man without the money to buy his way out. He is bumped off by his former business associates. Lisbeth returns to her past.<br /><br />This film toned down the original story and improved the character of Lisbeth. It has repulsive characters and some X-rated scenes. This story echoes "The Big Sleep", "Chinatown", and "Roseanna". Can you believe a serial killer living in an isolated location? Most serial killers seek areas with a large transient population for victims. It warns about the Internet (was it designed to allow governmental agencies and others to access your computer?).</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZHSORK1HHYTT.html">A2ZHSORK1HHYTT</a><br/><p>The major difference between the Swedish version and the American version, is the portrayal of Lisbeth Salander.<br /><br />First: If you read the novels, you know that Lisbeth Salander was only 5 feet tall and weighed 90 lbs.  In the Swedish original, Noomi Rapace is actually 5'3" tall, and in the American remake Rooney Mara is 5'6".  Folks, there was a reason author Stieg Larsson made his heroine 5 feet tall.  He wanted this little girl to be a gallon of nitroglycerine read to explode -- like she did when she kicked ass on two Hells Angel types.  This was an essential part of the plot -- that someone so small, could be so violent.  Making her 5'6" loses this dramatic point.<br /><br />Second: Facially, in the novels, Lisbeth is not pretty, or would even be considered attractive on any level.  She is described as having a boyish figure and facial piercings.  This is accomplished in the Swedish version with Noomi Rapace -- nude, she is flat chested and her body and face are just so-so.  In bed she is not truly sexy or sensual -- she gets on, gets off, and is finished.  She does not make love.  The Swedish director deliberately cast this actress to accomplish this faithfulness to the novel.  The American director made Rooney Mara look -- at times -- beautiful.  She does not have a boyish body; she has a very young womanly body with normal size breasts. In bed, she is very attractive.  Very sexual, very sensual.  She makes love.  This is not Larsson's Lisbeth.<br /><br />Third: Psychologically, Lisbeth is an introvert who is filled with hostility.  In the Swedish version, the reporter slowly works his way into her confidence, and she (somewhat) lets her guard down for him.  The American version carries none of Lisbeth's borderline psychosis.  Rooney Mara, as Lisbeth, just "acts" like she is pissed off at the world.  It doesn't take much for the reporter to get her into bed.<br /><br />Conclusion: Stieg Larsson in his triolgy set himself a monumental task:  He asked himself, can I make a small unattractive girl, who is extremely introverted and hostile, and continually acts antisocial and like a bitch -- have the reader (audience) come to like (maybe love) her? This is a girl that we would never sit next to on a crowded bus -- but by the end of the novels (movie) we'd have her over for dinner.  Make no mistake, probably 90% of everyone who saw the Swedish film disliked this obnoxious character from the opening scenes, but by the end of the movie we were rooting for her.  The American version loses this quality of character.  Rooney Mara is tall, attractive, and her Lisbeth is not really super obnoxious or completely introverted.  Once again, her version of the character just "acts" pissed off.  The director missed the point.<br /><br />Sure, see both versions, and maybe read the books.  If you want Lisbeth Salander, you will only find her in the Swedish version.  The reviewers who thought the American version was as good or better than the Swedish version, did not understand the character of Lisbeth.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF.html">A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF</a><br/><p>You immediately get a taste of the difference between the original and American versions in the opening credits which were typical American overbearing with it's dramatic CGI and accompanying music. Within the movie itself viewers of the original are most apt to be put off by other differences such as the  exaggerated tats, piercings and makeup as well as the exaggerated robotic emotional portrayals. The difference is analogous to seeing entertainment oriented fake wrestling vs. the real wrestling. The editing was disjointed as our characters seemed to jump from scene to scene despite the distances. The acting was a little too stiff. Lisbeth's and Mikael's computer skills seemed like what an older, computer illiterate person might engage in while doing a goog search. The sex scenes seemed to be added solely to gain market share and just didn't add to the story. Lisbeth's and Mikael's problem solving research were a far-fetched not believable. Their physical actions seemed dumb e.g. Lisbeth sneaking up on someone in loud clunking shoes on marble floors was just a "sure you are" or Mikael sneaking around and out of the house only to get caught. A "dummy" of a supposedly smart investigator. You didn't feel as if she was the one riding the motorcycle. Just a roller coaster, uneven ride of a movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Having never read the late Stieg Larsson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307949486">2005 source novel</a>, an unforgivable oversight I know, I didn't know what quite to expect with this 2011 crime drama beyond what I already knew of director David Fincher's generally dark-hued work (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H1SVO8">Fight Club</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HWT6DO">The Social Network</a>). For instance, I didn't know the film's narrative would be bifurcated until the midpoint of its 158-minute running time. One side of the movie belongs to the girl of the title, Lisbeth Salander, a deadened goth-punk computer genius, and the other side belongs to Stockholm journalist Mikael Blomkvist whose latest expos&eacute; of corporate evil about a billionaire Swedish magnate has been declared libelous. Disgraced and broke, he accepts a private investigation job offered by Henrik Vanger, an elderly industrialist who would like to resolve the 40-year-old mystery of his murdered niece Harriet in the Swedish hinterlands up north. The list of suspects, Blomkvist is told, includes several members of Vanger's dysfunctional family, eccentric fascists and Nazis still living within walking distance from his manor.<br /><br />Obviously, as Blomkvist gets closer to the truth, his life becomes more endangered. Juxtaposed with Blomkvist's investigation is Lisbeth's unenviable existence back in Stockholm. Having just compiled an extensive background check on Blomkvist for Vanger, she has just been appointed a new legal guardian, Nils Bjurman, due to her state-declared mental incompetency. Bjurman abuses his authority by forcibly raping her. Lisbeth eventually regains control of her life by blackmailing him in the most degrading manner possible, an act of revenge both horrifying and satisfying. Blomkvist decides to hire Lisbeth to help him uncover the connection between a cryptic message written in a notebook and a series of murders that occurred from the late 1940s to the mid-1960s. The labyrinth plot escalates into a series of increasingly revealing connections between Harriet's disappearance and the entire Vanger dynasty, in particular, Harriet's brother Martin, now the CEO of the Vanger Corporation, and their estranged sister Anita, living in London with no desire to reunite with what remains of her family in Sweden.<br /><br />At the same time, Lisbeth and Blomkvist become romantically involved, which naturally brings its own set of complications but also provides the impetus for a final act of revenge. I assume screenwriter Steve Zaillian's adaptation of the source novel remains faithful, but just as important, he manages to present an elaborately plotted thriller with most of the necessary details presented intact. Fincher does an impressive job propelling this complicated story with dazzling cinematic technique and handles the more lurid moments with the same professional ease he displayed in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00464F19Q">Se7en</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK7KVQ">Zodiac</a>. However, the meticulous emphasis on procedure sometimes disinfects the movie to the point of making the principals feel more like plot devices racing toward the resolution. At certain points, the plot developments feel as cold as the wintry Scandinavian setting. Despite this tonal discord, the cast works effectively within the story's convolutions and conventions. Even with a variable Swedish accent, Daniel Craig is able to submerge his cool Bond persona just enough to play the wry, middle-aged investigative reporter in a compellingly human manner.<br /><br />Christopher Plummer as Vanger, Joely Richardson as Anita, and Robin Wright as Blomkvist's married editor Erika all play their roles with precise authority and surprisingly convincing Swedish accents. In more challenging roles, Yorick van Wageningen as Lisbeth's abusive guardian and Stellan Skarsg?rd as Martin are even better. However, it's Rooney Mara (Mark Zuckerberg's scabrous girlfriend in the opening scene of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HWT6DO">The Social Network</a>) who really gives the movie both its mystique and emotional wallop. With pale eyebrows, shapeless clothing, and awkward manner, Mara's Lisbeth concurrently craves attention and deflects it with almost every movement. The actress makes her character's savant skills and photographic memory perfectly believable and most of all, makes Lisbeth's seeming passivity quietly heartbreaking with a modicum of expression. It's a superb, star-making performance. Cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth deserves mention for capturing the severity of the chilled images needed to convey the story, while the original music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross provides an appropriately haunting undercurrent.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SS6VRWCTB7V.html">A3SS6VRWCTB7V</a><br/><p>Watched all 3 Swedish "Girl" dubbed English and liked the series very much. Rented the American version out of curiousity. What??  Why was this film made?? If you want "Girl", do the Swedish version and skip this. Did not like tinkering done with end of this one either. Not recommended. Get the Swedish version.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FY3H6F4249E0.html">A3FY3H6F4249E0</a><br/><p>Geeze.  This review is based solely on the movie.  I did not see the apparent prior version or read the books, but I did not expect this.  Sex -- no problem.  But, explicit sodomy/rape, forced oral sex, torture, animal decapitation, photos of murdered and tortured women and lesbian sex -- I could have done without.  The screams in the sodomy/rape scene were heart-breaking and sickening -- certainly not "entertainment" by the wildest stretch of the word.  I personally do not understand why there were so many positive reviews on this film.<br /><br />My son and I both enjoy Daniel Craig as an actor, and thought the promo looked good. I was surprised he accepted this role.  The movie was 2 hours long or more.  The first 3/4 was very slow.  The last 1/4 was fast-moving and interesting, and saved the film from death.<br /><br />The movie begins with a winter scene in Sweden.  Mikhail (Daniel Craig) loses his savings in a court battle over "inaccurate reporting" as a magazine journalist.  He reported a story without being able to prove it.  Meanwhile, a separate side story gets our attention about an unconventional young girl trying to survive.  She is living off a trust fund and is an exceptional part-time independent investigator. Watching the two stories side-by-side for some time, you wonder how they will eventually come together.  Although Rooney Mara gives an outstanding performance as Lisbeth Salander, the troubled young girl, in my opinion, her abilities are wasted in the violent storyline of this movie.<br /><br />Veteran actor Christopher Plummer requests Craig come to his mansion on the Island in or around Hedestad, where he offers Craig a nice sum to write his memoirs.  (According to the internet, Hedestad is a ficticious place, but if you happen to be traveling to Stockholm, the Stockholm City Museum is currently offering a guided tour that visits real locations that the book mentions.) What Plummer is really asking is for Craig to investigate the murder of 16-year old family-member Harriet, killed many years ago.  Her body was never found.  The Island is all owned by members of the same family, many of which who do not speak to each other.  Craig moves into the guest house on the property and begins to investigate.<br /><br />With the price of movies today, don't waste your money on this flick.  I see that some folks think it was brilliant.  Needless to say, I did not like the overall movie and I offer you my humble opinion as well, and why, so that you can make an educated choice of whether or not you want to see it.  If they had left out the behaviors mentioned above, I would have still only rated it an overall 3 because it was interesting but much of it was very slow.  No, I will not watch it again and I will not buy the video.  I hope you do not take your young children with you if you choose to go to see this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is a Hollywood adaptation of Swedish writer Stieg Larsson's mystery novel. The film, of which story is dark and often violent, is directed by David Fincher, who is known for such thriller as "Se7en" and "Zodiac."<br /><br />The film is about a Swedish journalist and co-owner of the magazine "Millennium" Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), who, after losing a libel case brought against him, sets out to investigate what happened to Harriet Vanger, grandniece of Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), a retired CEO of a family industry, when she suddenly went missing about 40 years ago.<br /><br />To do so, he enlists a help from a genius computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), who has gone through terrible experiences as you will see in the film. "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is more about the luridness of the truths than the process of finding them out, and about the characters who can be very brutal without remorse.<br /><br />Considering the subject matter, David Fincher is the right choice for making an English-speaking version, though it seems as if the director has lost interest in the film's final 20 minutes or so.<br /><br />Some nay find the film's English-speaking characters (played by the international cast) in the Swedish setting a bit strange. But perhaps the film would have looked stranger had its story been set in somewhere in America. After all remaking a film is not copying the original, but changing it, so something must go.<br /><br />With Jeff Cronenweth's effective photography, Fincher's version looks more polished than the Swedish counterpart, though I don't know if it is really a good thing. The 158 minute film is most notable for Rooney Mara's strong acting and director's skills that keep the sinister feeling going on in the film's world.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>At the time of his death, Swedish author Stieg Larsson was sitting on a trilogy of unpublished novels called the "Millenium Series".  His life ended before he was able to see his trilogy about an unorthodox ward of the state surveillance agent named Lisbeth Salander, take off into an international sensation. His novels became best sellers, in 2009 the first of his trilogies was made into a Swedish film called "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" and was consequently followed up with two more films, and now the movie has been adapted into an English language film, directed by David Fincher (Seven, Fight Club, The Social Network).<br /><br />Salander, (Rooney Mara) otherwise, the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, has led an abusive life and after her legal guardian suffers a stroke, she is legally assigned to a new guardian, who uses his position and her money as a tool to abuse her even more. "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is hard hitting and offensive at times, but such is the beauty of Larsson's writings. We would all like to believe that violence and abuse doesn't exist, but the truth is we choose to ignore it, brush it under the rug and pretend it doesn't.  This is the very theme that resides throughout Larsson's "Millenium Series" and throughout "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo".<br /><br />The majority of the movie centers on a 40-year old murder mystery and a fourteen-year old girl who vanished from a prominent family without explanation. Mikael Blomkvist, (Daniel Craig) a magazine publisher, is hired to investigate the crime. Through a course of events, he and Salander become partners into a rich and complicated mystery.<br />As someone who has seen all of the Swedish films and can give an opinion about the English language version, based on the original, David Fincher has added much to the film. The movie appears to be more in depth and shows more of Lisbeth's character changing throughout. Her harshness softness as the movie goes along and Fincher has chosen to emphasis that more. The movie can feel wordy and long, but during that time, the information and investigation is thoroughly interesting and challenging.<br /><br />"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is a breakout film for Rooney Mara, just as it was for Noomi Rapace (Sherlock Holmes 2), who played the title character in the original release. She fought hard for the part and she does it justice. She wears the scars of a troubled past like a glove and is able to shed those things when it is necessary.<br /><br />I can't say that the new version is better than the original or worse. The truth is, they are both great films because of the subject matter, the richness of the characters and the writing. The new film will certainly bring a larger audience to an already popular series of movies worldwide. "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" will most certainly be one that will be mentioned on Oscar night, if only for just Rooney Mara.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9V37MS6QY8D.html">AE9V37MS6QY8D</a><br/><p>Usually remakes pale in comparison to the original, but I really enjoyed this one so much than the original!

And just when I thought nobody could portray hacker Lisbeth Salander better (or any more of a bad@$$) than Noomi Rapace, then came Rooney Mara! Wow! Her portrayal of Lisbeth elevates the character to "all-time great character" status! The performances are masterful and the story and pacing are just right! The story doesn't pull an punches (nudity, rape scene, sex scene) but it is a must-see for any murder mystery/thriller fan!</p></br><a href="../users/AAZRWLML88IZK.html">AAZRWLML88IZK</a><br/><p>Lately, it seems, if you're looking for remake fodder, Scandinavian cinema is where it's at. Christopher Nolan mined Norway for Insomnia, and Matt Reeves went to Sweden for Let Me In, both of which turned out to be rousing successes. Enter David Fincher, who last year helmed the American version of another Swedish property, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, an adaptation of Stieg Larsson's global bestseller of the same name, and came out with a great hit of his own. The story, for those unfamiliar, revolves around a disgraced journalist who enlists the help of a rebellious young hacker in hopes of unraveling the mystery behind a decades-old missing persons case; as they dig deeper, they uncover a vast conspiracy with far-reaching implications. With material here that fits squarely within his wheelhouse, Fincher succeeds in translating the Swedish hit for American audiences, complete with all the lurid details, the unabashed brutality, and the wholly committed performance from his lead actress.</p></br><a href="../users/A18CMGIQZ1OAA2.html">A18CMGIQZ1OAA2</a><br/><p>yes i loved it but i will not give it a perfect rating because fincher made blatant changes that i found arrogant and unnecessary. im not a director but i dont see how inanimate objects being changed is time saver. i will say that the acting was amazing. they did a great job with what they were given. my only problem was with the directing and screen writing. lisbeth was too open but im certain rooney mara acted as she was told. shes a great actress and id never say otherwise nor would i with daniel craig. i believe it should win awards left and right but i do not hold it above or below the swedish adaptation.  like most american filmmaking i believe it was over the top. I loved the score and i think it helped the film flow. i did roll my eyes at the beginning with the music and the effects during the opening credits because all i could think was "oh fun, theyve turned it into a music  video". i guess they needed something to grab the audience with and the film got past that soon enough. im happy they did an american adaptation of the girl with the dragon tattoo which has become one of my favorite books. I just hope people take the time to read the book. there were alot of things that i disagreed with in the american film but there were also things in the swedish film that i disagreed with. im happy i decided to see the american film despite my original reaction to the idea of one being made. I am gonna buy a copy of the dvd when its released to go with my other dvds of the trilogy. I wont be paying 22 bucks for it though. its over priced for a dvd thats not a special edition.</p></br><a href="../users/A1POFVVXUZR3IQ.html">A1POFVVXUZR3IQ</a><br/><p>As someone who has read and loved Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy and watched all the Swedish film adaptations of the novels, I was quite skeptical about the Hollywood treatment of the first book, fearing that it would take too many creative liberties and not stay faithful to the essence of the novel. Well, my fears were thankfully misplaced, as I love this film adaptation, rivaling the original Swedish remake (which I am a fan of).<br /><br />The casting for the Swedish film adaptation was excellent, and I think the Hollywood remake gets it right too. Daniel Craig plays the role of besieged journalist Mikael Blomqvist, who has just lost a libel suit filed against him by Hans Wennerstrom, a billionaire industrialist. Mikael has to pay a hefty sum of money to Wennerstrom, and to add to his woes, the publication he works for is also in financial trouble. Robin Wright plays his married lover and editor/ owner of the publication. Respite comes in the form of an offer from Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), scion of a wealthy family, and retired CEO of Vanger Corporation. Ensconced on the hauntingly beautiful yet desolate Hevestad (which I believe is fictional), Henrik wants Mikael to investigate what happened to his beloved niece Harriet, who mysteriously disappeared several decades ago. Tempted by hefty financial compensation, Mikael is further lured by the promise of confidential information that Henrik possesses, information that could potentially help Mikael against Wennerstrom. Soon, Mikael finds himself holed up on Hevestad in the dead of winter, investigating a cold case, and facing a cool reception from the other members of the Vanger clan, including Harriet's mother, uncle, etc. though he does get some encouragement from one of Harriet's cousins, Martin (Stellan Skarsgaard), who is now the CEO of the company.<br /><br />Rooney Mara plays Lisbeth Salander, a 23-year-old ward of the state, who has been deemed asocial and incompetent of making adult decisions. Her state-appointed guardian has recently suffered a severe health setback and is unable to perform his duties, so Lisbeth is assigned to a sadistic lawyer who uses his position of authority to sexually abuse her. Mara is credible in her portrayal of an obviously tormented soul who can hold her own and shows that her frail frame belies a steely determination which is at times tempered by emotional vulnerability as seen in her later interactions with Mikael (Lisbeth ends up assisting Mikael on the case).<br /><br />The movie is about 2 hours and 40 minutes in length, yet I never felt the story lagged at any point. Each scene is important, and the setting and sense of place is as integral to the film as the acting. The cinematography is breathtaking, especially of Hevestad in the depths of winter - cold, brutal, and unforgiving. The procedural aspect of the story, with Mikael and Lisbeth investigating the case together and alongside each other is well-paced, with suspense being gradually built up until the climax. The use of technology is vital in this film, and viewers get to see Lisbeth flex her investigative muscles as she hacks her way to crucial information.<br /><br />There are some very graphic scenes in this movie portraying violence in the form of rape, physical assault, and nudity. There are also some graphic images of crime scene photographs.<br /><br />I read the novel several years ago, and it has been a while since I watched the Swedish adaptation but I loved this latest adaptation, and can't wait to see how the filmmakers adapt the other two stories in the series, and am especially interested in how they show the evolution of Lisbeth Salander's character.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Having not read the novel, and only seeing the 2009 version from Sweden, David Fincher's The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo isn't all that different from the previous one. No surprises I mean (other than a different ending), but I did think the cast is better and the whole look of the film is much richer thanks to the director's vision. This is suspense mystery that feels more like a typical drama at times. Be ready to sit back and absorb a huge amount of dialogue with people just sitting around, especially in the first hour, but it does move rather fast after that point. It feels like the 2 hour and 40 minutes that it is, though it doesn't drag quite as much as the earlier version.<br /><br />Noomi Rapace was excellent as Lisbeth Salander, but I like Rooney Mara's performance a little bit more. She somehow manages to make her gothic appearance look odd and attractive at the same time. Her line delivery is fantastic and whenever she is on the screen you simply can't look away. She has already received a Golden Globe nomination, but I think maybe an Oscar could be in her future. Daniel Craig is at his best here as Mikael Blomkvist and a big improvement over the previous rendition of the character. I actually believed his connection with Lisbeth this time around.<br /><br />The brutal scenes that people who have read the book or have seen the 2009 movie know they are coming and are pushed even further here in terms of what is actually seen. If you don't know what is coming, prepare to brace yourself. The lady sitting behind me said "disgusting" more than once.<br /><br />Special mention for the opening credits. A new cover of the "Immigrant Song" plays over black oil colliding and making various shapes and characters in the story. I thought I was watching the next Daniel Craig Bond movie.<br /><br />I have had a trend over the last two years of seeing the most depressing movies right before Christmas.

The scene where the protaganist revolts and tricks her rapist is very toned down in the American release as compared with the Swedish version and not nearly as powerful or surprising.  The acting is all fine and the desaturatied colors fit the bleakness of the characters and story lines but there is little use of your surrounds made in this very dialouge driven film.  There were certainly many scenes such as the motorcycle being driven on the roads that could have made use of your 5.1 theater system.  The video transfer is fairly free of noise and rates a 4, the audio a 2.

It is made more explicit on things Scandinavians practice a lot but do not show, sex and emotions. So the sex scenes are more developed though they remain within Parental Guidance and the emotions are of course essentially present at the end and of course again in the negative way, the disappointment is for Lizbeth, the poor girl who thought she could be loved by a real respectable man on a permanent basis.<br /><br />The film does not bring one iota more on the exploitation of the young people who are made dependent on the state and under guidance, control and even at times more from some kind of bureaucrat who takes advantage of the situation for his own perversions. Be sure if it were a woman the situation would be the same. The bureaucrat always thinks his authority gives him the privilege of exploiting those who are under his or her control.<br /><br />In the same way a family business has become an impossible quagmire because the members of such a family consider that their name gives them the privilege of exploiting the business to their own benefit, to exploit the workers with the same objective, and of course to cover up their worst impulses under the virginity of the power of money. It is true at the same time the Swedish family business that is used as a screen to hide criminal activities is redoubled with the case of another international business, this time not family at all, that is a blanket covering the recycling and laundering of all kinds of drug and criminal money. This extension is quite funny in a way since it will serve the vengeance of the raped and humiliated and exploited dependent girl who gets rich by just hacking a whole set of accounts in the Caiman Islands. No complaint possible since it is criminal money in a tax and financial haven.<br /><br />What's left is the denunciation of the deep hypocrisy of the Swedish society about its past. Sweden was one of the first countries in the western world to introduce eugenic laws against all kinds of people who were a burden to society, more than thirty of forty years before Hitler in Germany and quite in line with what the British author H.G. Wells advocated at the end of the 19th century that will also produce social Darwinism and behaviorism in the USA.<br /><br />Then in the past and still in the present the people who are classified in those categories, Swedish or foreign, are silent preys to the predators who are in the positions where they cannot be asked any question. The police will do its job but without the means they need, nor the will they need, to get to the rock bottom of the problem and the criminals will walk free and proud, respected and even loved in society.<br /><br />That film should make us think and think again and we should keep in mind that politicians are too often doing the same and a prostitution ring can operate in one of the most important hotels of a big city, across from its opera and nothing is done till finally some scandal comes up generally from outside the country or from a marginal complaint and political interests are finally giving the police the power they need to do their job. Everyone knows about it, and first of all the mayor or mayoress of the city but everyone pretends nothing is happening, including the press that is so blind at times.<br /><br />If you don't believe it is possible just go to Lille in France, New York in the USA and presently a city in Shanghai had the same problem with the mayor being demoted;, including from all his national and regional jobs and his wife is in custody under the charge of having killed a British journalist who was too nosy.<br /><br />What is the world coming to? Go see that film and you'll understand just 10% of what it really is.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br></body></html>

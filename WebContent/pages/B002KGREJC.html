Juno is not your typical teenage pregnancy story.  It is, instead, a realistic, yet surprisingly entertaining look at an extremely difficult year in the life of a young pregnant girl.  With a loving and caring family, good friends, and the baby's father, Juno attempts to take back control of her life and her circumstances, and to make life altering decisions in her own unique and quirky way.<br /><br />Ellen Page is a phenomenal young actress who plays the title role of June with realism, warmth, intelligence and a wisecracking wit.  Juno wants to do what is best for her baby, for her family, for her friends, and for herself.  Ellen Page expertly runs the gamut of Juno's emotions and hormones, slowly drawing us in and making us a part of this girl's life and her predicament.  We laugh, we cry, we hope, we care.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is equally talented and up to the challenge.  Michael Cera as the child's father and Juno's best friend, J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney as Juno's shocked but supportive parents, and Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner as the desperate, prospective adoptive parents all give excellent, believable performances.<br /><br />Juno sneaks up on you.  It is a quiet film that subtly gets under your skin.  I highly recommend this film for a sweet, touching evening at home.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>Juno is a sweet enough film despite the subject matter. However, it is not really clich&eacute; as far as films like this go. There is no question about what exactly Juno wants to do with the baby, there is no obnoxious babbling regretful baby daddy or angry pissed off parents. It feels different than all those other films. Ellen Page is perfect for this role. She is barely even acting, its like watching someone in real life. She is what makes this film work. There are sweet tender moments and comedic parts as well. I couldn't help getting a tad teary-eyed at times. As far as all the praise it got during awards season, that was a bit too much in my estimation. It is a cute enough film, just nothing spectacular or terribly unique.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OBJ2263JCK5.html">A1OBJ2263JCK5</a><br/><p>What can I say? I've now seen Juno once in the theatre and a number of times on DVD. Every time I've seen it, I'm all "faklempt" (meaning emotional or choked up for any non-yiddish, speakers out there) by the time the end titles roll. Call me a wimp or a weenie, but this movie gets me every time I see it. But isn't that, what the best movies do? Move something in you, get to your emotions. That was certainly my reaction to "Juno". You can argue the point, but I think that this little, low budget, indie-style comedy was one of the best movies of 2007.<br /><br />"Juno" is the comedy/drama story of Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page), a precocious, cocky, wise-cracking teenager, who suddenly finds herself pregnant, after sexually experimenting with her best friend Paulie (Michael Cera). After being put off by a visit to an abortion clinic, Juno answers an ad in the local 'Penny Saver' newspaper for 'adoptive parents'. They turn out to be Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) & Mark Loring (Jason Bateman) a yuppy-ish, childless couple, who have plenty of issues of their own. During the course of the film, we follow the next several months of Juno's life as a pregnant teen and her relationships with her parents, Paulie and the Lorings. What starts off as a very funny, screwball-ish, alternative comedy, eventually evolves into an emotional story, where Juno must find out, that she dosn't have all the answers. The last thirty-some weeks are not just a mere inconvienance, that will soon be forgotten. In the end, Juno must learn to "grow-up real fast", all while finding out the true meaning of love.<br /><br />Don't be put off, if the above plot synoposis sounds a little too much like an old 'ABC After School Special'. This is as far from the standard, Hollywood mush as you can get. First time screen writer, Diablo Cody and Director Jason Reitman have joined forces with a brillaint cast to create an imaginative, smart, well-written film, which is both funny and moving at the same time.<br /><br />I love the fact, that the script dosn't treat the characters or the audience like there a bunch of dummies. When was the last time a Hollywood film about teen pregnancy didn't make the parents out as a bunch of clueless, overeacting, yelling idiots, the teen father-to-be as a jerk or even wealthy yuppies to be one dimensional. Instead, this film very subtlety reveals different layers of these characters. You get to know these people and find out what makes them tick.<br /><br />Ellen Page as the film's title character is just wonderful. Page gives so much nuance in her performance. Just watch the emotions, that run across her face, when she is forced to reveal she's pregnant to her parents. She put in one of the best performances of the year. Hopefully this young actress will have a brillaint career ahead of her. The rest of the cast is equally good, showcasing stand-out performances from J.K. Simmons, Alison Janney, Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner and Michael Cera.<br /><br />Finally, mention should also be made of the film's energetic music soundtrack, that features the works of anti-folkie, Kimya Dawson, British  alt-rockers, Belle & Sebastion and other various artists. These songs will get stuck in your head and keep you humming for days.<br /><br />This is a great movie, which has its' fill of both big laughs and tears. Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>...and this is one of those films. It is both hilarious and touching. It is also one of the most realistic films about teenage life that I have ever seen. Ellen Page is amazing. I loved her in "Hard Candy" - her performance, not her character - and I loved her in this film as well. She IS Juno, and you care for this young lady and her ordeal. Ellen Page is an amazing actress, and I cannot wait to see her future films. The rest of the cast is also excellent. One thing that must be mentioned here is the writing. It is so funny and so honest, and all I have to say is that screenwriter, Diablo Cody, is a genius when it comes to words. Some people have said that this film is derivative of Wes Anderson's work, but I totally disagree. It is Jason Reitman's best film so far, and I liked this one better than "Thank You For Smoking". The music is also very quirky, and I liked it a lot...<br /><br />Please, do not miss the chance to see this one in the theatre! You will laugh your head off, and you will come out of it deeply moved. I loved this film!<br /><br />SEE IT!</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>Back in 08, when the movie came out on DVD, there was a huge buzz about it winning best screenplay and, so I decided I should check it out.<br /><br />The movie is about a 16 year old girl named Juno MacGuff. I'm not kidding. I'm serious. Throughout the movie I tried to pretend that name wasn't the most pretentious female protagonist name I've ever heard but I failed. She talks like a real smartass and acts all cocky to people. She's 16 and is in love with Paulie Bleeker (again, another pretentious "indie" name). One day she finds out that she got pregnant from a time when she and Paulie had sex. She considers having an abortion, but after being forced to face the fact that once you make a decision it stays with you forever, she decides to come out about her pregnancy to her parents and give it up for adoption. She finds one family in a classified ad who has an infertile mother and goes to get to know them. She takes a keen kinship to the husband, who loves indie music and cinema, including one situation where they watch the 70s cheese horror flick "The Wizard of Gore". Then a bunch of drama and depressing indie pretentiousness ensues and... I... just... don't... freaking... care. The end.<br /><br />I didn't HATE this film. Some lines were funny and I liked some of the cast, including the guy who played Jameson from Spider Man, Jennifer Garner, and Jason Bateman, who of course charms in each role. One particularly powerful scene was when Juno has an emotional breakdown in the van- Finally she acts instead of trying to be a teenager and spewing cocky words.<br /><br />To say the characters are cardboard is an understatement- they're TISSUE PAPER THIN. Juno is not likable at all. Why should I sympathize for her? She's just a smartassed cocky borderlining-on-bitch who has absolutely no reason to be in the story other than the fact that she's the protagonist and she's pregnant. And her constant pop culture references were don't help either. Paulie I have no respect for- come on, getting a girl knocked up before she's even old enough to drive has no respectability in it, and the movie tries to make me care about him by making him all "cute" and "awkward" but come on. Also, this film in a way almost glamorizes teen pregnancy- Their parents are cool with her being pregnant AT 16 (I've known people in this situation and trust me, their parents were the exact opposite of that). There's much more but it would be too long to list. Oh and for the record, I don't think I've EVER heard anyone say "Pork swords".<br /><br />I don't even think creepy looking assassins with stupid haircuts and silenced shotguns could have saved this film. It's not terrible but I honestly don't get why it's so praised.</p></br><a href="../users/A10E3F50DIUJEE.html">A10E3F50DIUJEE</a><br/><p>I thought this movie was just a great piece of light-hearted cinema.  Although the slang is a little dense (and frankly some of it is just weird, but maybe that is because I am 25 years old and already out of the loop), Ellen Page totally entranced me.  She was compelling and believable as the quirky, yet still naive girl in over her head.<br /><br />My favorite part of the film is the beginning: Rainn Wilson is just great in that little role.  The line, "it started with a chair" was so intriguing.  And her sitting in the living room set outside Bleeker's house with the pipe in her mouth was priceless!<br /><br />Give it a shot and enjoy yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>Juno is a whole lotta nuthin. Some people call it witty,funny, etc.. *YAWN*..Its not very interesting and the whole plot is pretty silly. Teenagers talk like this? Really?? Not any that I know; grunting maybe..<br /><br />  One reviewer called it "an irresponsible movie", I tend to agree. Getting pregnant in high school used to be a bad thing - not anymore. Now rich white people looking to adopt will run to your door if you get stuck with a baby at 16; well, if you have a white, healthy baby (They ARE worth lots of $$$)..<br /><br />  Juno is a whole lotta sizzle and no steak. Its not a horrible movie, but its not worthy of all the hype.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>At 16 Juno MacGuff is into 70s Punk Rock and Slasher films; she lives with her Dad, Stepmom and half-sister; she is a junior in high school; oh, and she's pregnant. Juno tells the story of the girl by the same name as she faces the choice of how to handle her situation. She is not married to, or even dating the baby's father. She is, as already mentioned, only 16 years old. She makes an interesting decision and the movie goes from there.<br /><br />Rarely will I address the soundtrack or the casting of a movie. I normally tune out the music (sorry for the pun) and will address only individual casting decisions. I have no choice but to talk about both here.<br /><br />Music is one of the comforting, yet (at times) conflict-inspiring, elements in Juno. With it being so important to characters, it is only appropriate that more attention be given to the soundtrack. The music was not ambient noise; it was used almost as a narrative technique and also to ease transitions between scenes. Music played a key role in the film and was used perfectly throughout.<br /><br />I cannot remember the last movie I saw where there was not a person out of place. Each person who participated in Juno seemed perfect for his or her role.<br /><br />Ellen Page (Juno) showed a lot of versatility as the movie's title character. She was always in control of the role, even when it meant playing someone so conflicted. Juno was strong, but vulnerable. She was smart, but ignorant. She was mature, but too young to know any better. Her personality was abrasive, which was not eased with the amount of slang that she piled on to every conversation early in the movie. But that changed. As the movie went on, Juno did what 16-year-old girls do: she grew up.<br /><br />I had not experienced the "magic" of Michael Cera until Juno. He has received such an incredible amount of praise from his role on "Arrested Development" and his part in Superbad, but I never watched the former and he did not impress me in the latter. But in Juno he was perfect. However, I sure hope I am not the first person to point out the stark similarity in his performances. Beware the typecast Michael, even though it is probably too late.<br /><br />Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner deserve some praise for selling their parts so well. And while everyone was so good, one person rose above the rest: J.K. Simmons, who played Juno's father. He was a lot of the movie's comedic relief, but that was such a special character for what his relationship meant to Juno. My appreciation wasn't entirely for the part, J.K. seemed to bring something extra to the it. His performance was one of my favorites of the year.<br /><br />From my -- however limited -- experience, Juno was an original story with a unique perspective on one pregnant teen. The story flirted with "afternoon special," but never went over the edge. Any scene which could have led to sappy clich&eacute; was immediately steered clear, usually with humor. While I would not classify Juno as a "comedy," it definitely had some of the most genuinely funny dialogue I have heard. As the credits roll you will find that Juno was a story you would not normally snuggle up to, but preconceived notions be damned! Both touching and funny, Juno was a very good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P1508PZ0UADD.html">A3P1508PZ0UADD</a><br/><p>Tends to glamorize teen pregnancy and make it seem "fun" and easy to get rid of.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FY3H6F4249E0.html">A3FY3H6F4249E0</a><br/><p>I saw this one in the theater, quite by accident.  I took my 15-year old granddaughter to the movies and she said, "Let's see Juno.  I heard it was really good."  I had no idea what it was about.  As the movie started, a 16-year old girl was talking about how she had had sex in a chair with this boy and I though, "Oh my God!  What have I done!"  Well, the movie was quite good, indeed.<br /><br />I believe Juno had sex one time with this boy from school who was about the same age, and, as we all know is quite possible, she got pregnant.  The movie takes you through the whole pregnancy:  how Juno's life changed throughout the pregnancy, decisions she had to make, how she told her parents, should they get married, should she have an abortion, should she keep the baby, should she put it up for adoption? and so many other related issues.  The movie delt with a very serious subject matter, but it did it well and in a non-judgemental way.  There was quite a bit of humor in the movie, but the humor did not diminish the seriousness of the subject.<br /><br />I was really surprised at how good this movie was.  The theater was loaded with teenagers, some with their boyfriends.  I like to hope that they all got a better appreciation of the responsibilities that come with sex from the movie that teens are not necessarily ready for.  Judging from the audience's reactions, I think it made them all think.  No one left making goofy remarks and laughing.  The show seemed to be attempting to show you the whole picture (like the domino principle) of all the people affected and how.  It did not seem to be condemning anyone either.  It was more like "OK.  I made a mistake.  I accept the consequences.  Now, my options are: x, y. z."<br /><br />And, yes, both my 15-year old granddaughter and her 59-year old grandmother enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />If you are trying to decide if you children should watch it:<br />1) They probably know WAY more already than you think they do;<br />2) They may have done some exploring already; and<br />3) This movie might give them a better perspective because it seems to speak their language.</p></br><a href="../users/A3572FTYUQQW3P.html">A3572FTYUQQW3P</a><br/><p>This movie has more product placements and commercials than you would see in an evening of watching TV.  Many of these seem forced, out of place, and have a sour note quality.  However, this movie is being touted as the best movie of the year and in my opinion it deserves all of the praise and hype it is getting.  It is so good that it is hard to start describing why it is so good.<br /><br />The screen play and plot are relatively simple and uncomplicated and there are some scenes that could be improved but any weakness in the screenplay is more than offset by some of the scenes and lines that are some of the best I have seen in any movie in a long time.  Near the beginning we see the boys running track and we hear Juno comment that she loves watching their "things flop up and down" and "all she can think of are all of those "pork swords".  We see the boys running throughout the rest of the movie and it is hard to erase this from your mind.  Then we have the fight over the senior prom.  Michael Cera's performance here as the wounded dad and exboyfriend is superb, of course Ellen Page does an outstanding job throughout the entire movie.  Another great scene is with J K Simmons (her dad) when she asks him if true and enduring love is possible.  Speaking from the perspective of a 40 year marriage his response was spot on -- a short but well done scene.<br /><br />Then we have the couple who are slated to adopt the child.  Jason Bateman as the prospective dad does an incredible job of showing his immaturity and self-centeredness.  His reaction when Juno calls him old and rejects him is truly excellent since so much of it is in his expression and body language.  Every single actor in this film did an outstanding job and Ellen Page and Michael Cera were the best I have seen in any movie this year.<br /><br />The camera work was excellent as was the direction.  The scene with the freight train was very symbolic and beautifully done just as the scene where Bateman bolts down the stairs to see Juno.  No words were needed -- great direction.<br /><br />I loved this movie but much of it hit too close to my youth and it left me sort of depressed even though it has a semi-happy ending.  I don't think this is a movie suitable for young children but I think it is wonderful for teens.  This is a great movie and should be a candidate for best movie.  I gave it 5 stars and it deserves every one of them.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Q6R4481YFFG.html">A14Q6R4481YFFG</a><br/><p>I finally got a chance to see Juno and came to see that the movie withstands the hype.  Great acting and absolutely perfect casting complement sharp, although not terribly realistic in spots, dialogue.  The moral point -- you have to grow up fast when you make the wrong choices but being an adult doesn't mean you always make the right ones either -- is a great life lesson and not easily captured in movie form.  Highly recommended for adults.</p></br><a href="../users/ACEA95FQS1AVP.html">ACEA95FQS1AVP</a><br/><p>I think all the media stories, Oscar buzz, interviews, and hype set the bar on this movie so high I couldn't help but be disappointed.  When I saw previews and commercials for it, my first thought was "they put all the funny clips into those spots".  And I wasn't completely wrong.  There were a few other funny scenes, most notably with Allison Janney, but the rest of the movie was kinda slow.<br /><br />After one night of unprotected sex, Juno discovers she's pregnant.  She goes for an abortion, but can't bring herself to go through with it.  She finds an ad in the paper for adoptive parents and decides to give the baby up.  From that point, viewers jump from scene to scene as Juno's pregnancy progresses.  Kids at school stare; she has an ultrasound (a very good scene wherein Janney tells the technician off for being judgmental); she visits the adoptive parents; she hangs out; etc.  Unfortunately, with the notable exception of Juno herself, all the other characters are VERY two-dimensional.  The boyfriend is a bit of a nerd who doesn't have a lot to say.  Juno's best friend is a ditz who's got a crush on a teacher.  And ALL the kids speak with the  stereotypical "these are teens, they have their own jargon" crap.  At one point I was tempted to start the movie over just so I could count the number of times they say "dude."  I know that teens do have a lot of common idioms they use, but this felt like I was watching "That 70's Show." (the visual art direction of the film reinforced this as well). I think Juno was supposed to come off as very mature (or wise) in her worldview, but at the same time she had unprotected sex and chose adoptive parents out of the newspaper.  JK Simmons was wasted in his part and could've offered more to the movie as a supportive but disappointed dad.  Same for Allison Janney.  Of course, the perfect couple who wants to adopt is only perfect on paper. I think this was meant to be a source of conflict for the movie, but just didn't measure up.  Viewers are supposed to feel some pity, I think, for the husband who obviously has no common interests with his wife, is being rushed into fatherhood, and never got to pursue his dreams.  All I could do was agree with his wife, "grow up."  She wasn't even two-dimensional - successful business woman who wants a baby, that's it.  Since the couple is a such minor piece of the movie, it didn't matter that much.<br /><br />However, the film wasn't all bad.  It had a good message, showing the very real and negative side of teen pregnancy, physical as well as psychological.  And I like how they emphasized how many people are desperate to adopt because they can't have children of their own.  Yet, the film managed to avoid being a moral indictment.  She made a mistake, but dealt with the consequences as best she could.  Juno is a very likeable and spunky character that made this movie better than it would've been.  Ellen Paige deserves kudos for her acting, but the screenplay didn't deserve all those accolades.  There were some very funny scenes and the ending was well done.  Yet, this didn't succeed as a comedy. And, I don't think it succeeded as a look into a teen's life (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00013RC2K">Thirteen</a>).  Overall, I think it would have been better as a made-for-tv movie.  It was worth seeing, but I'm glad I didn't buy it.</p></br><a href="../users/ARMVAHWQQ9S8A.html">ARMVAHWQQ9S8A</a><br/><p>This universally enjoyable film, like all the greats, will leave you with that "ahhhh" feeling once it is over.  It is not over-long (a recent trend with popular movies) and the story is quite simply well told, both through the amazing cinematography and the witty dialogue that snaps, crackles, and pops across the screen.<br /><br />Whether you're in it for the heartwarming story, the witty one-(or two or three)liners, or just looking for something different to watch, I suggest you stop searching right now and settle on "Juno."  It's one of those films that will leave you with that odd feeling of wanting more, yet satisfaction with the completed story it tells.  And so far, I've only talked about the writing and the direction.  The cast is great, starring the fresh-face of Ellen Page, who captures the essence of Juno's character perfectly.  Her voice, her gestures, and even the way she walks are all a part of crafting this character, and Ellen Page has done a spectacular job.  The rest of the cast, Michael Cerra (of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WZEZGI">Superbad</a> fame) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H5V8DG">Alias's</a> Jennifer Garner are all wonderful in this film.  Also, I can't finish off this review without saying how hilarious Olivia Thirlby is as Juno's best friend, Leah.<br /><br />If this review seems like gushing praise, I suggest you contest what I'm saying and give Juno a try.  If you don't return praising the movie as much as I have, then... Then you simply did not see the same movie.  "Juno" is the movie of the year, without a doubt.<br /><br />10/10 Classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Let's face it -- teen pregnancy is an ongoing problem, and is not something admirable or funny. But I have to admit, the way you handle it can be.<br /><br />That seems to be the goal of "Juno," a relentlessly quirky, cracking-wise little comedy about a girl who makes a dumb mistake, and the smart decisions she has to make after that. While it initially seems rather precious, the Wes Andersonesque scriptings hide a bittersweet, warm little story about responsibility and love.<br /><br />After a lot of Sunny D and three pregnancy tests, Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) comes to the inevitable conclusion: she's pregnant by her friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera).<br /><br />Because she "heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant," Juno initially goes in for an abortion, but ends up running out of the clinic. Instead, she's going to have the baby and give it to someone who wants one, but can't have it. So she reluctantly fesses up to her parents, and starts scouting ads for suitably (if unedgy) parents for her baby -- the wealthy Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa (Jennifer Garner).<br /><br />Mark and Juno form a bond over their shared tastes, but she starts to suspect that not all is well in Yuppieland -- especially when Mark decides to break up with Vanessa, because fatherhood would force him to be a grown-up, not a rock god. As her due date approaches, Juno must decide what is best for herself, Vanessa, the baby... and just maybe, the adoring Paulie.<br /><br />Recliners on the lawn, cactus-grams, guitars with names and "The Wizard of Gore" -- it's pretty obvious that "Juno" will win prizes for kooky quirk, if nothing else. It certainly has that in spades, and while it has some awkwardly scripted moments, the colourful and acerbic portrait of a teenage girl having to make some heavy adult decisions is definitely a winning one.<br /><br />Admittedly, "Juno" is a bit too precious in the first few scenes, when we have a weird store clerk saying things like "Your eggo is preggo" and getting replies like "Silencio!" Come on, loosen up and stop trying to be cooler-than-thou.<br /><br />But as the pregnancy storyline really kicks in, "Juno" settles into a storyline that is equal parts quirky-funny and touching. Jason Reitman flavours the whole plot with his snappy, clever direction with plenty of acid-laced voiceovers from Juno, on the world around her. And Diablo Cody's dialogue ranges from deliciously sharp ("I'm not crying, I'm just allergic to fine home furnishing") to entertainingly over-the-top ("Phuket, Thailand!").<br /><br />But as witty and quirky as the plot is, it wouldn't be much if it didn't also have a heart. As the movie winds on, we get to see Juno maturing -- learning to weigh coolness vs. maturity, appreciate her family, and what is right for her baby and the Lorings -- the scene where Juno helps an upset Vanessa talk to her baby is adorable. Not to mention that our pregnant heroine has to figure out whether true love is staring her in the face.<br /><br />Ellen Page gives a note-perfect performance -- her Juno is funny, sassy, wise beyond her years, and profoundly unconventional ("Thundercats are go!"). Cera is equally good in a more subdued, lovably dorky role; it's pretty hard not to love Paulie just for being himself. And Garner and Bateman are wonderful too, as an uptight, lonely woman who desperately wants a baby, and a Peter Pan type who doesn't want to act like a grown-up. Bleah, who needs him?<br /><br />"Juno" has its flaws -- moments of excessive preciousness -- but it has plenty of heart, wicked dialogue, and excellent acting. Call it a Cautionary Whale.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>This movie can boast some great elements, but it seems like they don't belong together in the same movie.  There's some simple but upbeat music, but none of it belongs in a movie riven by gut-wrenching crises.  There's many snappy lines by the lead, Ellen Page, but none of them seem to fit the moment in the movie (e.g., like I'm so sure that when admitting what's happened to her parents -- who up to this point aren't even aware that she's "sexually active" -- she'd be quipping that Bleeker had been so "good in chair.")  That just didn't strike me as reality.<br /><br />So heck.  If you take away the snappy dialogue and the fun movie, you're left with quite the forgettable script.  And I don't wanna hear people saying that Ellen Page is a great actress:  this role was totally easy!  She never had to invest in it, so to speak.  The only scene in which she really had to lay it ont he line was the crying scene in the car.  Big whup. The rest of the scenes she plays in a monotonously even tone that ends up nearly sabotaging the script:  because of her, there's no character arc to Juno!<br /><br />As for that guy who wants to play his guitar and live in a loft apartment!  You go!  Your t-shirt is awesome!  Forget that woman!  The world has enough babies.  What we need is more artists and dreamers.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>This movie has some good parts, but overall I feel it makes too lightly of teen pregnancy. With it being a big issue in our country, this film makes it seem too sweet (even though there's a few hard parts in this film) and just to me, did not resonate.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>'Juno' manages to achieve exactly what it set out to be, a feel good, inoffensive, funny film. It manages to mix hilarious, laugh out loud moments, with more poignant moments and Ellen Page has an ability to deliver dialogue in a way that will make you smile even before the punchline. The first half is the funniest, where as the second half becomes a touch more serious as it resolves the issue of the film, Juno's teenage pregnancy. The soundtrack is great (so much so I bought it) and compliments the various scenes perfectly. I didn't expect to enjoy this quite as much as I did and for that reason alone it was a happy surprise. There are mixed reviews for his film here, but if you want an easy going film, that is excellently acted, with great music and with an interesting enough storyline, then this is the place to go. Well worth a viewing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G9FX1KV45N41.html">A1G9FX1KV45N41</a><br/><p>There are plenty of other movies with a similar theme, but this movie shines because of various differentiations, not least being the special quirkiness in a lovable way of the lead character.<br />Juno Mc Guff (Ellen Page) ,a 16 year girl, cute, quirky and with a quick wit and sarcastic tongue) is a girl who marches to her own beat. Juno hides her own emotions and fears under her wisecracks and perky demeanor.<br /><br />When she finds out she is pregnant  by her  on and off boyfriend, the shy Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera) she decides against aborting the baby (which has astonishingly led to attack on the movie by some radical leftist-feminists for the implicit that might be alternatives to abortion). she finds a yuppie couple Vanessa  and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) but gets more involved with their lives than she hopes to be.<br />Juno's deadpan dad Mac MacGuff (J.K. Simmons) domineering step mother Brenda 'Bren' MacGuff (Allison Janney), and her incorrigible friend friend , Leah (Olivia Thirlby) add colour to the production, it is the dialogue that makes this movie, there is more to it than just the plot and you have to see the well done interplay to see what I mean!</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Juno is a whip-smart teen confronting an unplanned pregnancy by her classmate Bleeker. With the help of her hot best friend Leah, Juno finds her unborn child a "perfect" set of parents: an affluent suburban couple, Mark and Vanessa, longing to adopt. Luckily, Juno has the total support of her parents as she faces some tough decisions, flirts with adulthood and ultimately figures out where she belongs. This is a delightful and good-hearted movie. Full of life and splendidly written.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>The characters are interesting and funny. The dialog is very good. The acting is excellent. The characters find true love. The main character learns about life. There are no perfect couples and life is complex. My biggest problem is the baby. Juno had sex because she was curious and she was bored. I don't understand why they didn't have protected sex. She planned the encounter for months and she obviously knew better. They didn't have sex in the throes of passion. They had sex because they were curious.<br /><br />We follow the pregnancy's development. Juno through it all never forms an attachment to the baby. She objectifies it. She decides not to have an abortion because she was uncomfortable in the clinic and didn't like the staff. She decides to give up the baby for adoption.<br /><br />In the end there are no consequences. She is the same strange, sweet girl at the end of the movie as she is at the start of the movie. The baby is completely out her life as if nothing happened. Her father says to her at the hospital after Juno gives birth that one day she will be there on her own terms. I don't understand. She made every decision to get there in the first place. It was on her own terms. Maybe, he meant that the next pregnancy will be planned and she will want the baby. She seems depressed after the birth, but no moral misgivings and no post-partem depression. The baby is almost a Hitchcockian McGuffin. It is introduced into the plot to provide conflict.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie but maybe because I was a guy I was not overwhelmed. The one really bad thing is the music. One obnoxious song towards the beginning goes on forever with horrible lyrics and an repetitious melody. I think the song was supposed to be a duet of Juno and her boyfriend. However, there was no reason to inflict so much torture for so long.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I thought this movie was just hilarious. I didn't find it to be this awe inspiring thought provoking flick. I just liked it and found the dialogue and characters to be really hilarious. Ellen Page is great.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N.html">A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N</a><br/><p>This is a film I had wanted to see when it was in theaters, but I just wasn't able to make it. Juno (not the town in Alaska) is a story about a teenage girl going through the process of an unplanned pregnancy. Not being able to go through with an abortion, Juno seeks out an alternative means..."adoption" but on her own terms. There she seeks out and finds the Lorings (Jason Bateman, Jenifer Garner) as the quintessential parents. The Lorings are a well to do(very yuppie), upper class couple who are childless and have been unsucessful in having there own children. Vanessa Loring (either unable to have a baby or not wanting to endure pregnancy-I wasn't sure which at first?) deeply, madly, desperately wants to have a family and be a mother. So, over the next several months, Juno goes through the motions and growing pains of pregnancy, all the while coming to terms and to her own realizations of motherhood,couples and relationships. Juno ponders on finding that one person who will love you no matter what, and not put into more simpler terms other than, "pretty,ugly,thin,fat,handsome,no matter what...the right person will think the sun still shines out of your ass" put so eloquently by her dear old d,a,d. I really enjoyed this film. I loved Juno's off color,dry and quirky sense of humor and especially her insight (from a girls perspective).Ellen Page is also turning out to be a great actress, plus...she's pretty damm cute to boot and perfectly cast as the main character. Well worth watching and owning, Juno is one of those rare gems (especially being a teen targeted film) that actually has quite a bit of substance to it rather than pointless,shallower, more intelligence draining teen films made in the past. Well worth watching with a nice message delivered at the end,it was a really cute story about an otherwise sensitive subject.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>I can't recall any movie in recent memory that got such a quick audience turnaround then Juno. People seemed genuinely excited that after the bombast of last summer, here comes a film that actually took story and character first and yet now people have completely turned on the film and called it overrated and not funny at all. While there's some nitpicks I can say about the film, the amount of backlash and criticisms laid upon the film seem kind of unfair. This film isn't made to get the discussions going and highlight social issues a la the Iraq War films; it's just simply a family movie, lighthearted in tone and fun to watch.<br /><br />Juno MacGuff is a young 16 year old who discovers that a night with best friend Paulie Bleeker brings the gift of pregnancy, or burden in her case and wants to have an abortion. Changing her mind and having birth go straight to adoption, she finds the perfect parents in Mark and Vanessa Loring but what we want and what we get can be 2 completely different things as Juno learns about life the hard way earlier than most.<br /><br />Juno can be described as a message film with the message actually never being said out loud. Whereas most films are content to have the theme said in dialogue, Juno takes the more smarter approach in showing the responsibilities and changing views that can come with pregnancy and it's not enough to be able to financially handle it, you have to know personally you can. Course many parents become unexpected mothers and fathers and many succeed but Juno doesn't explicitly say out loud the idea of "be prepared to handle the surprises of life" but it still works in the end.<br /><br />First, my one negative and its in the writing. Award-winning screenwriter Diablo Cody writes a very touching, sweet and realistic portrayal of the changes that come with parenthood which I felt were nicely handled but then we get the dialogue. Lines like "honest to blog?" and "Thundercats are go!" to signal the water breaking just seem...strange and you start to ask yourself whether anyone, let alone young teenagers, talk like this. But then other lines work and some of it was actually funny but I can see why people might not find it working for the film.<br /><br />Acting-wise it largely falls on Ellen Page's shoulders who shows the maturity and yet the naivety of someone old enough to know she doesn't know everything. We also get turns from reliable Jason Bateman, J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney as Juno's parents, Jennifer Garn..um, Affleck, and Michael Cera who always brings that deadpan humor though sometimes I feel it's just his Arrested Development character in movie form, but it's still a solid acting ensemble.<br /><br />Even though it looks like a film for everyone, not everyone will get its brand of humor but like the film anyway while others find it completely unfunny but I'd give it a shot anyway though to test the waters, try it with a crowd. Laughter is contagious, you know?</p></br><a href="../users/AXV9GS0TMSVW.html">AXV9GS0TMSVW</a><br/><p>While Ellen Paige gets accolades for her performance and Diablo Cody's story of stripper turned Oscar winning screenwriter have garnered attention of the public, the director Jason Reitman gets less and less kudos for his work on this movie.  Yet its his direction that often makes this work so well.  Juno is Reitman's second feature.  Like his first feature, "Thank You For Smoking," he's dealt with the task of taking a hot button issue, making it funny, and thereby not making it an issue.  This is why Juno works - And it's the team of Reitman, Cody, and Paige that make the whole thing come together.<br /><br />The script reminds of a Kevin Smith script for a slightly younger less stoned generation.  That is to say that the dialogue is hip, sharp, and quick.  Not only is it fun and reverent, but it doesn't drag.  Some people have griped about the unnatural way people talk in this film and that's when you have to looks at some of the best comedy scripts in recent years and you realize that writers like Cody and Smith carve out their own worlds in their stories.  It feels natural in the world of Juno that Juno can quip at the store clerk about her pregnancy test and he'll give a clever quip back.<br /><br />That actors in this movie bring Cody's clever dialogue to life.  While Ellen Paige carries a lot of the scripts weight, she's also supported by wonderful character actor JK Simmons as Juno's father.  In all the fun, the relationship with Juno's family is addressed very sincerely.<br /><br />What makes the film work above all things though is how, as stated earlier, this is not a movie about teen pregnancy.  Think of it as a device and you'll get the politics out of your system.  Cody's script is more about love, friendship, and maturity.  The film is a feel good film, but the relationships in the film are complex.  Cody's script and Reitman's direction keep you interested til the end giving a very satisfying conclusion.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Teenage pregnancy is frequently a starting point for myriad philosophical arguments: some see it as a major problem, some see it as an argument for the need of early teaching of contraceptive technique and sex education, some see it as a reason for championing abortion, and some see it as a piece of life that confronts families in both positive and negative ways.  JUNO is a beautifully written (Diablo Cody) and directed (Jason Reitman) version of unplanned pregnancy offered by a splendid ensemble cast: it is a movie that could modify the sociologic outlook of many people in a very strong fashion.<br /><br />Juno (Ellen Page) is sixteen and talks her best friend Bleek (Michael Cera) into having sex: the result is a surprise pregnancy that Juno shares with her girlfriend Leah (Olivia Thirley) and the store clerk Rollo (Rainn  Wilson) even before informing Bleek, a likable  kid who seems fairly flat about the situation. After discarding abortion as a viable solution,  Juno informs her father (JK Simmons) and stepmother (Allison Janney) of her status, and tells them she is going to complete the pregnancy and give the baby to some loving and needy barren couple.  Her parents are at first flustered by the news, but quickly  become supportive in a way that tells us many things about the durability of successful families.  With Leah's help,  Juno answers an ad for 'wanted: baby' in PennySaver and visits the Lorings (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) who desperately want a child and embrace Juno's gesture of adoption with eager excitement. The remainder of the film follows Juno as her abdomen increases in girth, finding new respect for her parents and for Bleek, and inadvertently walking in the troubled waters of the Loring's marital discord.  Without giving the story away, the ending is so tender and free of  clich&eacute;  that it allows us, the audience, to appreciate all the vigor and sensitivity and humor and warmth of Juno - an example of developing maturity that is a fresh breeze compared to the usual teenage movies.<br /><br />Ellen Page does indeed deliver a pitch perfect performance, but her co-stars are equally fine: Simmons and Janney break away from their usual type cast roles brilliantly, and the other members of the cast (the entire cast) flesh out this well written story with great skill.  The mixture of animated graphics and the imaginative musical score enhance the flavor of the tale.  JUNO offers an unbiased look at the topic of teenage pregnancy and wins on every level.  Grady Harp, April 08</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Juno was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7VHQE">Little Miss Sunshine</a> of 2007 - the little independent film that could. Once the studio realized that it had a successful crowd-pleaser on its hands, the film was promoted from the art-house circuit to the multiplexes. Actress Ellen Page and first-time screenwriter Diablo Cody became the film's breakout stars garnering the lion's share of critical raves and awards with Page getting an Independent Spirit Award and Cody an Academy Award. Now that all of the dust has settled, Juno can be reassessed to see if it really has the staying power and substance to cut through all of the hype and stand-up to the inevitable backlash.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody. The first thing that you notice when listening to Cody talking is how well Ellen Page mimicked her way of speaking. Reitman tends to dominate the track and, not surprisingly, talks about filmmaking aspects like the casting of minor roles, the attention to details for the sets, how he shot certain scenes, and so on. This is pretty decent track filled with lots of anecdotal stories and production details.<br /><br />Also included are 11 deleted scenes with optional commentary by Reitman and Cody. We meet Juno's crazy next-door neighbour. There's also a different introduction to Juno's family. We see Mark and Vanessa's first attempt to adopt. There's also an amusing bit where Juno has a solo gig and sings a song about getting pregnant. These are all good scenes and Reitman explains why there were cut.<br /><br />There is the obligatory "Gag Reel," a hilarious collection of blown lines and goofs with Bateman making Page break character time and time again.<br /><br />The "Gag Take" is an odd scene where Rainn Wilson and Reitman get into it with a mock heated argument.<br /><br />"Cast and Crew Jam" features the cast and crew members rockin' out to a song in this mock music video.<br /><br />There are "Screen Tests" for Ellen Page and Michael Cera. In the scene they do together you already see them in character and displaying excellent chemistry. There is also a test with Page and Olivia Thirlby and one with Page and J.K. Simmons as well.<br /><br />"Way Beyond `Our' Maturity Level" takes a look at the characters of Bleeker, Juno and her best friend Leah with interviews with the actors that inhabit them. Diablo Cody talks about how they are based on people in her life.<br /><br />"Diablo Cody is Totally Boss" is a profile of this novice screenwriter who got her start writing a blog and got noticed by a film producer. Reitman recalls his initial impressions of the script and the cast gush about its "unique voice."<br /><br />"Jason Reitman for Shizz" takes a look at the director. The producers gush about how he was the right fit for the material. He talks about establishing the right tone and how he shared the same vision for the film as Cody.<br /><br />"Honest to Blog!: Creating Juno" features Cody and Reitman talking about how the film came together. She credits her stylized dialogue to spending lots of time on the Internet. Cody also talks about how she came up with the idea for the story. They talk about specific scenes and her knack for depicting an unconventional family.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>Film focus groups, an abomination, have been around a long time.  This is where creative integrity is swapped out for box office bank-ability, assuming there was any there to begin with.  Various different endings and permutations of all types are tried out on a small handful of people in the dark.  Then, movies are trimmed and tailored to suit their tastes.  (Originality stands little chance.)  Well, apparently there are now Sundance focus groups.  How else could one explain the popularity of Juno, a movie whose sole purpose in life seems to be pleasing the smug, self-consciously hip judges at that increasingly less independent film festival.<br /><br />In this case affixing blame is easy, it belongs in its entirety to Diablo Cody who wrote the screenplay.  In the history of film has there ever been a character as improbable as Juno MacGuff?  Has there ever been a story more stupid, or confused about what it wants to say?  Juno begins as a surly, edgy, dark outcast and ends up just shy of the yearbook committee.  Her glib, sarcastic persona must have seemed delicious to those cool cats at Sundance, but the way adults buy into her dismissive attitude is preposterous.  Only the ultrasound technician, (Kaaren de Ziva), speaks to her and her ilk as they should be addressed, irresponsible and vulgar children.  The inevitable 3rd act reconciliations, emotional growth spurts, and newfound harmonies are beyond hokey and facile, and as for Paulie, the boyfriend she now loves, I have encountered loaves of Wonderbread with more personality.  We are supposed to buy that she has anything in common with him?<br /><br />Director Jason Reitman and a wonderful cast are to be heartily congratulated for transforming this three-legged duckbilled platypus into something resembling a movie.  Ellen Page really is remarkable as Juno; she takes a character more ludicrous than Batman and makes her seem real.  Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons, two reliable veterans, are extremely good as mom and dad.  Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are just acceptable as the prospective adopters.  I don't know if Michael Cera, Paulie, is good or not.  If he was intended to be completely vapid, uninteresting, and unattractive, then perhaps he's good.<br /><br />If you have any doubts about how bad this movie actually is, watch Little Miss Sunshine again.  Both films want to hit the same marks, Sunshine hits them, Juno self-consciously attempts to hit them.  It's like watching a couple dance; except they're following the footprints in an Arthur Murray Dance Studio.  Speaking of which, beware of the score featuring songs by Kimya Dawson.  Never has so much precious, pretentious, cutesy-poo teenage angst been packed into such a short amount of time - unbearable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EHTFVSD0H7I6.html">A1EHTFVSD0H7I6</a><br/><p>Juno is one of the most talked about movies of the year, hailed by some, scorned by others. I had the chance to watch it a couple of days ago. Sometimes I feel the need to write a review right away, other experiences compel me to stew over what I read or watched. Juno is a stew movie.<br /><br />For starters, I'm going to warn cautious parents of young teenagers and tweens to view it before letting their kids loose with Juno.  This film is a typical coming of age movie in that sexuality is a very strong theme. Several sexual comments, body part comments and situations that feel inappropriate and seem headed toward  a creepy place, pepper the film. There is no overt sexual activity, but there are scenes with clothing being removed and obviously naked, strategically placed persons. Though the cussing is less than I expected, some coarse comments are made in some unexpected scenes. I believe the f-bomb appeared once as a non-verbal and once as a verbal. There are other smatterings of language that are pretty low-key. The screenwriters apparently believe the statement..."cussing shows you lack creativity."<br /><br />That said, I can now tell you what I loved about the film. The characters are quirky, engaging and people I would likely grow to call friends. Juno plays fragile/tough/transparent and naive all in the typical adolescent roller coaster. She's creative, cynical and fresh.  I loved Juno's sarcastic, dry dad and her off-the-wall stepmother. The family, dysfunctional in a loving and bizarrely respectful way, works and radiates a borderline healthy relationship. Juno's confidence and convictions are innocent and sweet and make her character multi-dimensional in all the right ways. Her support system is a delight to watch as they help her through things that are, as stated by Juno, way beyond her maturity level.<br /><br />Juno's opening credits are creative, a blend of reality and animation that gives a hint that the filmmakers will deliver a visually satisfying film. They do. The dialogue is fabulous. Fans of Napoleon Dynamite might want to check out this meatier, edgier slice of cinema. Fans of Dan in Real Life will probably find much to like in the characters interactions. If you like to laugh and tear up within the same movie, check out Juno.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>There are many, many good things that one could say about JUNO, but they all have to begin and end with Ellen Page.  Mind you, this film features a very good cast and everyone excels in their role, but if Ellen Page is in the scene -- and she is in nearly every scene in the film -- she dominates everything.  As the wisecracking, (almost) unflappable, and very pregnant 16-year-old Juno, Ellen Page steals this movie.  She has already been nominated for or out and out won a number of awards for her performance in JUNO (including the Screen Actor's Guild and the Golden Globes -- she is considered a lock for an Oscar nomination), and seemed destined to sweep all awards for break out performance of the year.  She really is that good in this film.  I'd noticed Ellen Page before.  I first became aware of her in the third X-MEN movie, when she played my favorite X-Man, Kitty Pryde aka Shadowcat.  She did a great job in a pretty small role.  Later I saw her in the independent Canadian film WILBY WONDERFUL.  Most people will know her from her role in HARD CANDY.  But JUNO could be more than a breakout role for Page.  This could be the making of a legitimate star.  She is both extremely young and extremely talented.  If she wants to be, she could well be the next Winona Ryder.  The "wants to be" could be huge.  From interviews it doesn't sound like she especially wants a star career.  JUNO was not a Hollywood production, but was instead filmed in Vancouver.  In the past a number of Canadian actors have turned their backs on Hollywood and stayed largely north of the border (Paul Gross and Sarah Polley are just two actors I can think of who could have had big careers had they "gone Hollywood," but instead fostered smaller but superb careers in Canada).  I would not be surprised if Ellen Page was one of those.  But I would also not be surprised if she gobbled up a score of very desirable roles for smart, sassy young women in the next several years.  One thing she certainly has going for her is versatility.  She has at age 20 already shown that she can excel in drama, comedy, and horror.  Her range as an actress seems unlimited.<br /><br />As great as Ellen Page is, much of her success has to be credited to Diablo Cody's incredibly witty script.  To be honest, this is not truly a great movie.  The central story isn't that substantial.  But a dominating lead performance stringing together an unending number of great one-liners can certainly give the appearance of greatness.  I don't remember the last time I saw a movie that had so many truly funny lines.  And for that Cody has to be given the credit.<br /><br />As mentioned above, the film has a great supporting cast.  I was especially impressed by Jennifer Garner, who plays what is largely an unsympathetic role (until fairly near the end of the film).  As the "uncool" half of the couple who plan on adopting Juno's child, she has to play completely against type.  As a huge ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT fan I was delighted to see both Michael Cera (for whom 2007 has been a very good year) and Jason Bateman together in the same film, though they didn't have any scenes together.  J. K. Simmons and Allison Janney were both wonderful as Juno's parents.  Rainn Wilson of THE OFFICE has a very small but memorable role as a convenience store clerk.<br /><br />One thing that struck me while watching this film is how few starring roles there have been for wisecracking young girls.  There have been scores of films featuring wisecracking teenage boys (one need only look back to SUPERBAD as a recent example).  But once one gets past JUNO and GHOST WORLD there aren't a huge number of comparable films for young girls.<br /><br />One other random comment.  There was a very strange moment in the film when I realized that every actor in the scene (excepting Jason Batman) had been in a major action movie or TV series.  This was when Juno and her father were meeting with the adopting couple and their lawyer for the first time.  Ellen Page had been in X3.  J. K. Simmons, who played her father, has memorably portrayed J. Jonah Jameson in the SPIDER-MAN movies.  Eileen Pedde, who played the Lorings' lawyer, is a regular on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA as Sgt. Mathias, a veteran marine.  And Jennifer Garner portrayed yet another Marvel superhero, Elektra, in a pair of films, as well as Sydney Bristow for five years on ALIAS.<br /><br />A couple of more random comments.  The opening credits are among the best I've seen in ages.  They apparently took photos of Eileen Page and digitized them somehow to produce an animated sequence.  Very compelling and quite unforgettable.  Finally, the film has a truly great soundtrack.  Almost every film these days has a great soundtrack, but this one was especially fine.  They use the music of Kimya Dawson pretty extensively (whose music, I must confess, has always underwhelmed me), but they also use a long string of gems by Belle and Sebastian, the Kinks, Buddy Holly, Sonic Youth, Mott the Hoople, and Cat Power for one of the best and most eclectic soundtracks I've heard.  They also name drop the Stooges, but alas use none of their or Iggy's songs.<br /><br />All in all, this is a really fine film.  I'm not sure it is a great movie, but there is no question that Ellen Page turns in one of the best performances of the year by any actor, male or female.  My best guess is that she will get nominated for an Oscar but will not win, though she probably deserves to.  The Academy tends to bless mediocrity, hates comedies, especially hates films dealing with culturally controversial topics (like teen pregnancy, though drug addiction is usually a ticket to a walk to the podium, so go figure), and usually rewards bloated, "serious" films.  But I'd be delighted if she defied tradition and won the Oscar.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>For all those out there who think they've seen everything when it comes to teenage "coming of age" films I say think again. The recently released DVD `Juno' takes into account all the usual high school dramas one has come to expect from this genre of film but moves swiftly beyond those over explored storylines to catapult the audience into the interior world of Juno (Ellen Page), an attractive but rather "different" young girl who discovers she's become pregnant by Paulie (Michael Cera) her best friend and secret love of her life.<br /><br />Following Juno on her external journey through personal crisis on the road to adulthood  the viewer is also privy to Juno's internal thought processes thus offering the audience an invitation to establish an intimate relationship with the main character of the film. With such a superb performance by Ellen Page this intimacy is immediate and thoroughly satisfying.<br /><br />`Juno' explores the issues of young love and teenage pregnancy with a clever combination of wit and wisdom, sarcasm and poignancy all delivered within the parameters of one of the quirkiest storylines and cleverest scripts in recent memory. Ellen Page was amazing in the role of the firey but immensely loveable Juno. While the entire cast is wonderful, it's Ellen's performance that will stay with you. If that weren't enough, wait to you hear the incredible soundtrack!<br /><br />My Rating: -4 1/2 Stars-.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>"All The Young Dudes<br />All the young dudes<br />Carry the news<br />Boogaloo dudes<br />Carry the news"  David Bowie<br /><br />"But "Juno" (which played at the Telluride and Toronto film festivals, not the one in Park City, Utah) respects the idiosyncrasies of its characters rather than exaggerating them or holding them up for ridicule. And like Juno herself, the film outgrows its own mannerisms and defenses, evolving from a coy, knowing farce into a heartfelt, serious comedy." A.O.Scott<br /><br />Juno, played by Ellen Page, is the 16 year old heroine of this film, was named after one of the Roman Gods. In this case, it fits this character explicitly. Juno is one of the more mature 16 year old in this universe. After 3 pregnancy tests and a gallon of orange drink she accepts the fact that she is pregnant. She considers aborting but rules that out quickly. She confides in her close friend, and they look for suitable parents and find them in the local Penny-Saver.  Juno then sets the stage for her parents who are supportive and loving. J K Simmons plays her dad and Allison Janey her step mom.  They are not saccharine sweet but realistic and realize they have an independent and capable young woman in Juno. Her boyfriend Bleeker, Michael Cera, gives his support and in his way is there for her.  Her best friend, played by Olivia Thirlby, is the kind you gotta have, Dude.<br /><br />It took me half an hour of listening to smart, cool language, Dude, to realize I was indoctrinated quickly into the culture of this film. The film is not about pro or con abortion or any legal or moral message. It just is. Juno is pregnant after unprotected sex, and everyone comes together to accept what is happening.  The to-be parents played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are just the right mix until one of them decides this is not to be. Juno is in all honesty the most mature of this bunch-she guides the adults in her direction and nothing will upset her path. The soundtrack is great- a mix of the most quirky music out there- but you find yourself humming along and tapping your toes.<br /><br />"Part whip-smart teen comedy, part drama, backed by a quirky soundtrack and the most subtle comic performance by a youngster in years, Juno is a rare feel-good film in the morose pack of Oscar contenders." Jim Slotek<br /><br />I had no real wish to view this film, but was told by friends that it was a a winner, and it is. I loved the film. Got kind of teary at the end and the fresh approach by the writer Diablo Cody kept my attention.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 04-20-08<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GI3KGC">Hard Candy</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000060MWS">Switching Goals</a></p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>`Juno' at times comes off a little `too' abrasive.  Diablo Cody's script, which has been lauded as new-age perfection, can in moments come across forced and just a little `too' eccentric.  You may find yourself wondering if anyone really talks like this.  That said; the movie is so genuinely sweet and movie that it's easily forgivable.  In fact it's not a bad script; it's funny, witty and fresh, completely original; it's just a little `too much' at times.  That is the one and only complaint I have with this movie.  There is nothing else within this film that warrants another bad word from me.  The performances are sincere and touching, the plot is brilliantly constructed and the overall feeling of emotional connection I had in the close of this film was unexpected but joyously welcomed.  `Juno' is a great film.<br /><br />Here's why.<br /><br />The biggest plus this movie has it its fantastic cast who all commit wholeheartedly to the task at hand.  Everyone in this film is on point and that is not just a huge feat but a critical steeple for the films success.  When you think about the `witty' script filled to the brim with teenage lingo for the next generation it's some tough dialog to spurt and make believable.  The actors had a hefty assignment set before them.  If they didn't slip into character perfectly and fluently deliver their lines the film would have been a total loss.  It would have been choppy and awkward and a complete mess.  Delivering those lines fluently on the other hand would have taken a lot of work; and work they must have because not one actor failed to be convincing.  Everyone, and I stress the word `everyone', delivered magnificently.  It's the only way the script would have worked.<br /><br />The story follows young Juno MacGuff, a young teenage girl who finds out that she is pregnant (all thanks to that wonderful, blessed chair).  She decides against abortion and for adoption and so she searches to find the perfect family for her little sea monkey.  Those perfect parents wind up being Mark and Vanessa Loring.  It's apparent to the viewer that their relationship is not so perfect, but that's beside the point.  Juno thus decides that there is no other couple she would rather raise her baby and so with everything settled we now must wait, as do they, for the baby to come.  Waiting alongside Juno are her father Mac, her step-mother Bren and her baby-daddy Paulie.<br /><br />`Juno' is not your typical teen comedy for it actually delves deep into the workings of the characters it presents and helps us get inside their heads, know them and become a part of their story.  Juno is more than just another pregnant teenager to us.  Thanks to Ellen Page's Oscar nominated performance (so happy for her) Juno becomes a real person, with problems and issues and frustrations just like the rest of us.  Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are both fantastic as Vanessa and Mark, especially Garner who adds layers to her character, layers I didn't know Garner could deliver.  Michael Cera is just blowing up this year, and here as Paulie Bleeker he manages to make geek sheik.  J.K. Simmons is great as Mac and Allison Janney is flawless as Bren, utterly flawless.<br /><br />Like I said, there are times when `Juno' seems like it may be trying too hard but it's such a sentimental and sweet film that by the time the credits begin to roll you'll have forgiven it its minor trespasses and embraced it for the critical darling it's already become.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>I'm hoping JUNO helps make Ellen Page the star that HARD CANDY should have made her.  She was completely unknown to me when I went to see that harrowing piece, and her performance was Oscar caliber.  I've been eagerly awaiting more work from her, but other than a tiny part in X-MEN: LAST STAND, I've had a pretty long wait.<br /><br />But she totally steals JUNO...which is saying a lot, because almost everyone is pretty terrific in this highly entertaining film.  But Ellen Page is some sort of unique energy source.  She seems to do so little, but the tiniest facial tic or change in tone conveys so much.  She's clearly a super-intelligent actress and her characters are also intelligent (probably almost to the point of stretching credulity...but who cares, it's so much fun), and they are funny and in JUNO, sensitive.<br /><br />Juno is a sixteen year old who has just discovered she's pregnant, after one encounter with her longtime friend Bleeker (they are mostly just friends...not really girlfriend/boyfriend).  June at first considers abortion as her only option, but she quickly decides she'd rather carry the child and pass it on to a loving but needy couple for adoption.  She does this knowing full well that she'll be an object of much discussion at school, AND she'll have to tell her father (JK Simmons) and her step-mother (Allison Janney).  And she'll have to tell the baby's father (Michael Cera from SUPERBAD and ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT).<br /><br />She finds her immediate family to be shocked but supportive, and her dad comes with her to meet the couple Juno has selected (from the "Penny Saver" no less!).  These childless yuppies are played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman, and at first we think Garner is a bit of a control freak, and Bateman is the "cool" one...but this movie plays with our expectations of this couple right from the start.  I won't say much more, because much of the richness of the film comes in the changes Juno sparks in this couple.<br /><br />Juno is a whip-smart almost loner, who we find early on, is probably secretly pining for the love of goofy Bleeker.  And Bleeker certainly loves his old friend...yet these two have never faced these feelings...because they are both so confounded by them.  Juno is accustomed to having her act very much under control, and I believe she has a hard time admitting she has feelings that make her vulnerable to another person.  And Bleeker (played sublimely by Michael Cera...who is now officially in danger of being typecast for the rest of his life) is just too shy, goofy and flummoxed to believe his feelings would ever be returned.<br /><br />There isn't a lot of plot to the film.  It follows Juno through her voyage of discovery, at the child growing inside her, at her own feelings towards the boy who may become the man in her life and at what she discovers about the family she wants to give her child to.  What makes JUNO so much fun is the crackling dialogue (from current hot screenwriter Diablo Cody) and the equally snappy performances.<br /><br />(I appreciated too that Juno made the choice not to have an abortion.  Not only would there have been no film if she had...but it was refreshing to see a major film character make the choice she did.  Not because she was against abortion, but because she was able to make a reasoned decision that was not only great for her child, but great for another couple and quite enriching for her.  It also serves as a reminder that there are other choices besides abortion or deciding to raise a child yourself.  I don't feel the film was trying to make a statement...except to say "whatever you decide, think it through a little bit.")<br /><br />The dialogue is the kind that no one would ever speak in real life, yet it hews close enough to realistic that it becomes its own style of "hyper-realism."  Ellen Page has the aura of someone who might actually speak in this very cynical yet open and intelligent manner, and thus she pulls it off.  Therefore, everyone else (none of whom are quite so snappy as Juno) seems positively normal by comparison.  Thus, the dialogue works!<br /><br />The performances are very good as well.  As I said, Cera is wonderful at the type of part he plays...I hope he gets to stretch soon as an actor...but for now, seeing him work is a delight.  Janney is very good as the stepmother, who both loves and is exasperated by Juno.  Garner is touching in her smallish but important role, and Bateman brings interesting shadings to what could have been a one-dimensional role.  He underplays, and this is in keeping with the style of the film.  It's no wonder that his character and Juno's hit it off so well.<br /><br />But to me, other than Ellen Page, the MVP of the film is the always fantastic JK Simmons.  Can someone please sometime give this actor an award!!  From the over-the-top newspaper editor in the SPIDERMAN films, to the hilarious thief with irritable bowel syndrome in THE LADY KILLERS, to competent Dr. Skoda in "Law and Order" to the chilling white supremacist in "Oz"...this guy may be the best character actor around.  He plays Juno's dad so well, and their scenes together have a true warmth that spreads to the whole film.  He's a blue-collar guy...no doubt perplexed by Juno's immense vocabulary and her way of speaking...yet we can also see in his manner that he's a big inspiration to how Juno turned out the way she did.  It's a well-written part, and he knocks it out of the park.<br /><br />The movie is not perfect.  Again, the wonderful screenplay is a bit mannered.  It struck me that way a Woody Allen or Neil Simon script might strike an audience...these characters are too witty to be believed.  So while I thoroughly enjoyed the script and while it was well-executed...it still did not 100% elude the "hey, no one in real life would think to say that" syndrome from time to time.  It would say it was more like 95% of the time.<br /><br />Jason Reitman (who also directed the excellent THANK YOU FOR SMOKING) keeps the film moving nicely...but he's not a super-inventive director.  He finds good scripts and a good cast (90% of the battle) but there's nothing inspiring about what he brings to the film as a crafter of beautiful imagery or masterful framing.  He lets his actors do great work, and that's most important.  Some day, I hope he tries his hand at something that doesn't really on Aaron Eckhart's or Ellen Page's masterful delivery.<br /><br />But this is certainly a film high on my list for 2007.  I truly love Ellen Page, and I predict some more great things for her.  Her performance alone makes the film worth seeing...but thank goodness there are so many other great things as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>Academy Award Best Picture nominee Juno is a quirky, cute comedy. I never once laughed out loud yet found the story of the pregnant teenage girl looking for a home for her baby to be perfectly enjoyable. This movie generated a lot of buzz and did quite well at the box office. I don't know if it ranks as one of the best pictures of the year (it was much better than Michael Clayton), but this is a fun movie that you should check out. Due to language and adult themes, it probably isn't for young kids.<br /><br />Juno is played by Ellen Page. Page is perfect as the 16-year old junior stunned by the shocking news she is pregnant. Juno is witty, sarcastic, extremely intelligent and passionate about life. She is also very vulnerable, and it shows during the times that her plans don't work out. Like getting pregnant, for example. She tries to deal with it on her own and seeks out a family planning center that doesn't require parental consent. Abortion is a controversial issue, but in a teen pregnancy movie, it had to be dealt with. The movie deals with it and gets it out of the way as quickly as possible. With the help of the one friend that sticks with her, Juno plans to find a couple to adopt her baby. She believes she has found the perfect couple in Vanessa and Mark Loring (played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman). Vanessa longs to have kids, but can't, and Mark is very laid back and at times more interested in classic rockn'roll. This is a strange couple and some of the best scenes are between Page and Bateman.<br /><br />The movie is backed by a great soundtrack. Diablo Cody's screenplay keeps you tuned to the screen. Juno's dad, played by JK Simmons, is very supportive of his daughter. Michael Cera plays the father of the child, Beeker. He loves Juno, but their relationship changes because of the pregnancy. Because the issue of teen pregnancy is somewhat idealized, this movie is sort of a fairy tale. Still, I really liked this movie. Finally, an oscar nominee that wasn't too pretentious for regular movie goers to enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UFV4HALV2OXW.html">A1UFV4HALV2OXW</a><br/><p>A very precocious sixteen year old (Juno) becomes pregnant by her boyfriend Paulie after one encounter.

A realistic film about a phenomenon that has been on the increase.<br /><br />Ellen Page (Juno) is a very talented young address who will sure be a superstar one day.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>Writer Diablo Cody has managed to take a very serious topic, teen pregnancy, and successfully blend it with humor, innocence and a bit of fear to make a wonderful film:  "Juno."<br /><br />Some believe that this film champions the ideals of the pro-choice crowd.  Others see it as a movie that highlights the positive aspects of choosing life instead of abortion.  What I see is a film about a young girl who is attempting to rationalize the severity of her situation with a mind that is still in its formative years.<br /><br />Ellen Page stars as Juno McGuff, a teen who has just found out that she is pregnant for her good friend, Bleeker (Michael Cera).  On a whim (at least as Juno sees it), the pair have sex and now they have to deal with its consequences.  Instead of that happening, though, Juno pretty much keeps Bleeker in the dark about the entire situation.  He approaches the situation with confusion and innocence.  She tries to work through it with sarcasm and wit.<br /><br />Eventually, Juno finds an adoptive family for her child through the Penny Saver paper.  Enter Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner), a couple looking for their first child after many failed attempts.  Vanessa is hungry to be a mother while Mark is a little hesitant about becoming a dad.<br /><br />Once the legalities of the adoption are set, the rest of the film follows Juno through the ups and downs of being a pregnant teen and how her relationships with others are affected.  She deals with being stared at by classmates and sneered at by school staff.  Her relationship with Bleeker takes a few detours.  She bonds with Mark through music and with Vanessa through motherhood.  She also strengthens the bond with her father and step mother.  A twist is thrown late in the film to add a little drama to the story, but it fits perfectly.<br /><br />What you have in the end is a film that deals with teen pregnancy with well-placed humor and just the right amount of tenderness.  The cast, for the most part, is brilliant.  J.K. Simmons as Juno's father does a brilliant job.  He perfectly evokes a father's disappointment, confusion, fear and eventual pride and joy for his daughter.  Allison Janney plays Juno's step mother.  She shows how much a person tries to make a connection with their step child by protecting Juno.  Page can be a bit over-the-top at times, but she does a solid enough job to never make me lose interest in her character.  Cera does an excellent job of showing the uncertainty in Bleeker.  His character develops wonderfully as the story goes along.  Bateman turns in an impressive performance as Mark, a man approaching middle-age and still hanging on to the past.  While Garner does a fine job as Vanessa, I felt at times that she was pushing the emotional envelope a bit too much.  Her character seems to have this picture perfect (and somewhat Utopian)idea of what it's like to be a mother, but she also shows emotions that I find would be more likely to be found in a woman who is actually pregnant.  Still, this is the only shortfall in the cast and is forgivable thanks to the overall strength of the rest of the cast and the film as a whole.<br /><br />I must point out that the music is pretty good, but a few of the songs rake the nerves.  If you like your music with a bit of a folk tinge to it or happen to be a regular listener of NPR, you'll probably love the soundtrack.  If your tastes require a bit more punch, you might be turned off by the film's music.<br /><br />There is a bit of strong language in the film, but nothing that your average child over the age of ten doesn't hear in the store every day.  The sexuality in the movie is dealt with briefly and with humorous teen confusion, and there is no nudity.  On a positive note, Juno's family has a strong bond, which is especially important in dealing with a teen pregnancy.  Her father and step mother give her strong support throughout the film.<br /><br />If you're looking for a light comedy/drama that deals with a very heavy subject, I highly recommend "Juno."  I initially thought that this film would be a bust considering the heavy hype it received during its theatrical release, but it has turned me into a believer.  "Juno" is an excellent film.</p></br><a href="../users/A36RS7KTNOBROF.html">A36RS7KTNOBROF</a><br/><p>"Juno" grabs you from the start,walking down the street drinking a gallon of Sunny D.Ellen  Page is so cool,thats the only word I can think of.I've know people in my life somewhat like her who just say whats on there mind.I wish I could have been like that.<br />Michael Cera has become such a huge star,I never thought after seeing him on "Arrested Development"I would hear from him again,even though I was a fan of the show,and its great to have Jason Bateman also in the movie who does a great job .{I also think the music from the film is so cool and different}<br />The ending is a big suprise.I thought I figured it out,but I didn't.<br />"Juno" is a film  everyone will enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>Juno was actually better than I thought it would be.

Normally one wouldn't say that about a film centering around teen pregnancy, a failed marriage and broken hearts, but in his case? Yeah!<br /><br />"Juno" for those of you who have been living in caves, is a film about a young girl who, after a night's indiscretion with her best friend, becomes pregnant. Initially planning to get an abortion, she changes her mind and decides to put the baby up for adoption. It goes from there.<br /><br />What I like about this movie is that all the characters are treated with respect, especially Juno's parents who, when she tells them her "good" news, don't respond with the sort of hysterics you'd normally see in a movie. No, they handle it like you'd imagine such people would; quiet disapointment, but slightly proud of her for handling it as an adult.<br /><br />The writing is sharp, though a little twee for the first twenty minutes or so. Then it settles down into a nice, intelligent screenplay that doesn't talk down to the audience. All the plot twists seem earned, and all the emotions seem real.<br /><br />The acting all around is great, particularly Ellen Page as the title character. She brings a real charm and charisma to the movie that would be absent with almost anyone else in the role.<br /><br />The movie isn't without flaws. Jason Bateman's character isn't handled as welll as I might like, but you know, otherwise, this movie has earned every single acolade and award it's received and then some. It's a really, really good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>When a fine screenplay is written and actors come together and hit all the right notes, bringing it to life, you get something like JUNO.

You feel as though you're seeing yourselves or your neighbors living their lives.<br /><br />JUNO is written with tremendous wit and heart. The actors involved should all be commended and they will be rewarded with a film that will live on for ages. I've seen Michael Clayton, There Will be Blood & No Country for Old Men and without question, JUNO has been the movie that has made the biggest impact on society and will be watched 10 years from now.<br /><br />Then you throw in a killer soundtrack and people everywhere singing, "Anyone Else but You".

It is, at the same time, one of the most witty films, fun, and emotionally draining films made within recent memory. How is it possible NOT to like this film? Everything about it is done with such heart, honesty, and realism that every second glows and shines with brilliance. Along with the great film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FVQM2Y">Brick</a>, Juno is probably THE best independent film ever made (well, at least that I've seen).<br /><br />The story starts out with Juno, a likable, sarcastic, awkward high school teen who has just discovered that she is pregnant. She decides, instead of having an abortion, to have the baby and give it up for adoption once it's born. She is far and away the best part of this film. The plot may be a little reminiscent of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TZJBPQ">Knocked Up (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a> but it doesn't rely on cheep comedy to drive film forward; instead it utilizes its extremely likable and believable characters in a way which sets this film above most others of its kind. Juno, her father, step mother, boyfriend, best friend, they all play a critical role in the film and present viewers with a realistic portrayal of everyday American life in a small town with nothing to do. Despite their obvious problems and character flaws, despite Juno's flippant remarks like calling her baby a "sea monkey" that she "needs to let cook in the oven (her womb) a little longer" before she can give it to the adoptive parents, they just become more and more likable as the film progresses. The relationships that are developed and elaborated upon during the film, in their subtle ways, build tension better than any action movie could ever do.<br /><br />If there is a movie in 2007 without a flaw, that film will be Juno. Not only one of the most quotable films I've ever seen, but one which captures the atmosphere of small town conflicts in a most realistic manner. Do not go into this film looking for deep hidden messages, unique film techniques, or dramatic over acting; simply enjoy it for what it is, a slice of life in a small town. Why on earth did I decide to see Rambo 4 in theaters instead of seeing this gem of a film?<br /><br />Replay value; VERY high.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This was a pretty entertaining movie.

McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>The thing that separates "Juno" from so many other films about teen pregnancy is that, in this case, the 16-year-old who finds herself in that predicament refuses to become a victim of her circumstances.  From the moment she confirms the unwelcome news, Juno studies her options - abortion, raising the child as a single teen parent, adoption - then takes matters into her own hands.  Like the Roman goddess who is her namesake, Juno is a bright, often sharp-tongued individual who prides herself on her observant cynicism and her way with a sarcastic quip.  However, she's not above appealing to the adults in her life when the problems of the world get to be too much for her (though, in some cases, the grownups are coping with more serious issues than she is).  Yet, Juno makes certain that it is she and she alone who will have the final say when it comes to determining the course of her own future and that of her child.<br /><br />"Juno" is that rare low-budget, independent feature that finds unexpected success in the mainstream by striking a chord of recognition in audiences across the demographic spectrum.  First-time screenwriter Diablo Cody hits pay dirt with a clear-eyed, largely unsentimental script that is not afraid to go off in unexpected and interesting directions and that avoids patronizing its Middle American characters.  Juno's father and stepmother manage to take the news in stride, while the yuppie couple Juno alights on to be the child's adoptive parents are given a depth and complexity far beyond what a lesser writer might have afforded them.  Director Jason Reitman keeps the quirkiness to a minimum and allows the scenes to play out in a naturalistic, unhurried way.  Confident in the strength and appeal of his material, he lets the gentle human comedy speak for itself.<br /><br />In a star-making turn, young Ellen Page takes a daring approach to her character, often bringing Juno right to the brink of un-likeability, then pulling back at just the crucial moment, making us see how utterly likeable she truly is.  As the child's father, Michael Cera is virtually the same lovably passive nerd we found so endearing in "Superbad,"  while J.K. Simmons and especially Allison Janney give rich shadings to Juno's supportive parents.  Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner also make their mark as the couple who post their picture in the "baby wanted" section of the local throwaway.<br /><br />"Juno" faces the downside of any independent film that unexpectedly finds itself ripped from the confines of the art houses and suddenly duking it out at the multiplexes with all those high-budget, high-octane, testosterone-laden blockbusters - namely the risk of over-inflated expectations.  Thus, my advice is to look beyond all the hype and box office records and simply let "Juno" sneak up on and take a hold of you in its own quiet, inimitable fashion.  I think it works best that way.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>This simple "romantic comedy" is so wrought with life, love and sensitivity, it's no wonder Diablo Cody won the Oscar for her brilliant script. Ellen Page is perfect, as a youth who has seen enough to know how to handle things. Allison Janney is excellent, as is everyone else. Previous reviewers can wring out all kinds of angst about the situations involved, but I think Jason Reitman's presentation is the best teen film in years. There's a minimum of gross-out humor, as in most teen films, but almost everything that comes out of Ms. Page's mouth is worth listening to...thanks to Ms. Cody. There's absolutey no meanness, or ugliness or mean-spirit to take away from the love that abounds. I enjoy this film a lot. If you don't, lighten up...</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>Hmmm... a film about teen pregnancy, huh?<br /><br />I'm going to attempt to review Juno without revealing the twist that takes the film in a new direction from the social stigma. When I saw it, nothing in the trailers or word of mouth spoiled that twist for me. Hopefully, I won't spoil it for readers.<br /><br />Both Diablo Cody, the writer, and Ellen Page, the spirit behind the lead role, Juno (a 16 year old high school junior), have been nominated for awards in countless venues. Page is a veteran, having started in Canadian television when she was only 10. Diablo Cody logs her first screenplay for Juno, and she was working on TV scripts for the film's director, Jason Reitman, at least until the strike. Diablo's irreverence was first launched publicly with her 2006 autobiography, "Candy Girl" and yes, she lived and wrote about her life as a young stripper.<br /><br />In the trade-off of writing vs. acting talent, there would be few kudos for writer Cody's material in the hands of an actress less talented than Page (just 20, but plays 16 easily). Conversely, Page, who has played in several Canadian television series and some small films (the most notable of which is the 2005 film about pedophilia, "Hard Candy"), has never been given material of this nature. The pairing of Cody's acerbic writing with Page's quirky film persona was as successful as the casting of Abigail Breslin as Olive in Little Miss Sunshine. Molding writing and actress is young director Jason Reitman, who has already had one independent hit with "Thank You for Smoking" .<br /><br />Together, the three create a perfectly believable, nerdy 16 year old who has enough self-confidence to overcome her birth mother's desertion in her early childhood and her seemingly artless and uncanny ability to fit into a school situation where she understands all the teenage politics and is able to navigate cheerfully on the fringes of many high school communities.  Juno simply has no artifice.<br /><br />Over time, we glimpse that Juno has a passion for music, has played guitar in a teenage band, has two close friends: Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera in a great performance), who was also in the band and is perhaps the shy, male equivalent of Juno's smart outsider, and Leah (Olivia Thirlby) a popular cheerleader who prefers hanging with Juno to hanging with cooler kids in school.<br /><br />Without a lot of forethought, Juno has enticed Paulie into turning a make out session in his room to their first sexual adventure. From the opening of the film, which is colorful and clever, she's become aware that this experiment has left her pregnant. Everyone who she consults from that point, from girlfriend Leah, to the stunned Bleeker, to her parents (J.K. Simmons as her blue collar dad, Mac Macguff and Alison Janney as her stepmom, Bren), to the people who observe her in the school - all of them express no recrimination, and (this is the 21st century, and unfortunately, teenage pregnancy has been out in the open for far too long!) are simply puzzled by why Juno would have something so out-of -character happen to her. Juno, after all, is too smart for her 16 years, absolutely forthcoming with her thoughts and opinions, and not at all a teenage Lolita. Both Juno and Paulie are exactly the opposite of what you would expect teenage parents-to-be; seeming innocents with chutzpah. How did this happen?<br /><br />Although Juno considers abortion, her inquiry into the process leaves her running in another direction, and she decides to give the baby up to someone who really wants a baby. There is never any doubt that Juno knows that keeping the baby is above and beyond what she should expect herself to be able to do. Her maturity in making her own decision and finding a couple (in the Penny Saver!) who sound like good adoptive parents is in keeping with her positive outlook on this. Both Mac and Bren (who are absolutely great in small roles) treat her decisions with respect and are supportive of her in the process. Mac goes to meet the adoptive couple with her.<br /><br />To say that Juno is charming is to describe her meeting with the adoptive parents, the Lorings. Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) is obsessive about becoming a mother and finds it difficult to believe that the reality has walked in the door. Mark (Jason Bateman) is as acerbic as is Juno, and like a few of the other adults that surround her, he senses right from the beginning that she is a kindred soul - honest, forthright, a little eyebrow raising.<br /><br />All does not go smoothly through Juno's pregnancy journey, and the film allows her to pluckily downplay the difficulities she has with her changing body, with people's reaction to her, with her confused and mixed feelings about the Lorings, and about Paulie.<br /><br />In the denouement, you'll have come to know Juno well enough to predict what will happen, and enjoyed your time with her enough to leave the film with a smile on your face. A somewhat black comedy.....yes, but heartwarming and real, along the lines of Searchlight's 2006 hit, "Little Miss Sunshine".<br /><br />With some fine supporting performances (Garner's Vanessa becomes truly real when she bumps into Juno in a mall and is coerced into talking to the bump and feeling for an early kick) and a truly effervescent musical score, Juno is not just for teenagers (in fact, it's not for teenagers at all) it has charm for everyone. A light, entertaining, but thought-provoking film, Juno is sure to be on your list of top 10 films for 2007. Go see it!</p></br><a href="../users/A1HG2DOSBZEX4I.html">A1HG2DOSBZEX4I</a><br/><p>Jason Reitman's 2007 film Juno became a audience favorite and the little film that could. Juno penned by Diablo Cody ( who incidently took home the Best Screenplay Oscar) tells the story of a pregnant 16 year old detour into adulthood.<br /><br />Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) is a normal teenager who finds herself pregnant and faced with life changing choices. With her best friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby) she sets out to find the perfect adoptive parents for her child. What she finds are the Lorings (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman). The Lorings are confronted with their own issues as to what it means to be adults and parents.<br /><br />The film walks the thin line between comedy and drama quite well. The script is pitch perfect and the acting by the strong ensemble cast is a joy to watch. The film attempts to show individuals as humans not just cardboard cut-outs.<br /><br />The Blu Ray disc that I viewed presented a crystal clear picture and near perfect sound. The disc also features a ton of extras that enhance the viewing experience. Of especial note are the commentary by Reitman and Cody and the featured deleted scenes. This film was one of the sleepers of 2007 and should not be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>Stylized the dialogue may be - do 16 year olds really talk like this now? I doubt it - but this movie really entertains, despite it's soap-opera plot about a teen preggers and the yuppie couple that wants the baby. I was mesmerized. The soundtrack is a bit precious, but still likeable in the end. You'll foresee the outcome from the first 5 minutes, but this isn't a suspense tale. It's meant to say something about the human condition, and it succeeds.</p></br><a href="../users/A3II1ACACC5MTX.html">A3II1ACACC5MTX</a><br/><p>Juno talks like a character in Dawsons Creek, i.e like no 16 year old you ever met, but I thought she was pretty sexy and I wish I was her friend when I was 16. Or indeed at any time. Is that bad? The film is quirky but contrived quirky, its done almost too well, but I chuckled at it, and felt that it was more worthy than my usual DVD views. It was no "Captain Lust and His Pirate Women" though, now THAT was a film.</p></br><a href="../users/AOTMP0OKJOUWI.html">AOTMP0OKJOUWI</a><br/><p>I have already had the wonderful pleasure of having seen this movie twice. I cannot wait for it to come to DVD. My local movie critic considered this the best film of 2007 and I truly must agree with him. While it's not like we haven't seen the story of the pregnant teenage girl before, it's been awhile since we have seen it done with so much grace, humor, and heart and fantastic characters that earn your care.<br /><br />From the beginning involving a chair to the ending involving another chair, "Juno" moves effortlessly along in a simple-yet-gorgeous way that lets you view Juno's life as she sees it. No, it's not hand-held camera, but it might as well have been the lovable Juno directing.<br /><br />What really makes this show work is its wonderful cast of characters. Juno is the crowning star, but it is not like the others did not pull their weight. Jennifer Garner takes her sweetness from "13 Going on 30" and channels it into an adult yuppy. Jason Bateman is relatable, even when it's painful. Michael Cera pulls off a heartwarming performance. Allison Janney almost stole the movie. And it wasn't just stellar performances. These are wonderfully written characters, all fully realized and unique and proud to be so as they deal with this very serious situation of teenage pregnancy.<br /><br />This movie deserves all ten stars and all the praise it has received. It is well-made. It is well-written. It is well-acted. It has a great message. It finally has a teenage girl stepping up to take responsibility, even in a society that frowns upon adoption. I went through every emotion, from tears-inducing laughter to tears-inducing heartbreak.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>Having been named after a mother-goddess was the foreshadowing of Juno MacGuff's life.  Pregnant at sixteen is the unwitting challenge of her few years, one that she undertakes with such detached sarcasm her champions wonder if she really understands the scope of what's happening.  It is that aloof attitude that keeps Juno, her family and friends from being saddled with an otherwise intensely dramatic situation.  Or does it?  I found myself wondering if this film considered itself something teens and adults alike should relate to, with all its witty banter and smarmy camaraderie, or should we embrace such situations exactly as Juno, with a removed understanding of our strengths and limitations and the knowledge that our actions stand to impact a great many others, potentially in wonderful and terrifying ways?<br /><br />Juno hits the mark, and it does so in a refreshingly smart way.  If you want an underlying moral of the story you will find one.  If you want fast-paced tight lines from relatable characters it's all there.  Or you can just take the film at face value--the stellar big screen break-out creation of Diablo Cody, a woman with a keen eye for calling life like it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>Well, I've seen the film Juno.  Some say it's the greatest film they've ever seen, others despise it.  What do I think?<br /><br />I liked Juno.  It was rather light and fluffy, to be honest.  Anyone who is expecting a realistic portrayal of high school life and teen pregnancy will be greatly disappointed.  The film is a little different than what you would see in a mainstream film, but not much.  It's not edgy, it's not out there, and it is desperately trying to be hip.  Juno's dialogue made me wince, like someone who is trying to prove how "out there" she is with her witty quips.  A lot of the dialogue felt forced, which diminished its impact for me.  Juno's character would not date (and never have sex) with someone like Michael Cera.  More than likely he would be the best friend who really loves her while she dates a jerk.  They would never get together.  The plotline of the jock who supposedly loves Juno is silly and completely underdeveloped.  Jennifer Garner's character was contrived as well.<br /><br />But there are some good things about the film.  I really like Jason Bateman's performance and character.  I think he gives the best performance in the film.  Many have made hay of Juno's knowledge of music and movies outside of her age bracket, saying it's not realistic.  That isn't true.  Speaking strictly for myself, when I was a teenager, I was listening to Miles Davis, Keith Jarrett, and ELP, which weren't popular at all during that time.  I also had a friend of mine who was 7 years older than me who I hung out with.  He got me into bubblegum music, which also wasn't from my time bracket.  So this does happen, and probably a lot more than people realise.  Juno's father and stepmother were pretty decent characters, far from the caricatures that permeate indie films like this.  They were a little too pat at times (especially the father), but overall their dialogue was better than know it all Juno's.  I liked the soundtrack too.<br /><br />The film is not a realistic portrayal of teen pregnancy, in fact, it makes it look kind of fun and hip.  It's a typical indie film that's quirky enough so that the audience thinks they're seeing something really different, but in fact they're just seeing something that's a little different from Hollywood fare, but not much.  We're not talking hard boiled Bergman or Breillat here, just a cute film that isn't boring or tedious.  It isn't painfully bad like Knocked Up was, but it still isn't a masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>Of all the offbeat, heartwarming dramatic comedies of recent memory, Jason Reitman's "Juno" is definitely one of the better ones. It tells the story of an independent teenage girl who finds herself faced with an unplanned pregnancy: a realistic scenario, no question, and for some, it's even relatable. Ellen Page--whose performance in 2005's "Hard Candy" scared the living hell out of me--plays the title character, utilizing an entirely different but equally effective emotional range. Sixteen-year-old Juno MacGuff is a lively yet misunderstood young woman, always making wry comments on everything and everyone. Some of her comments are downright inappropriate. You wouldn't expect a girl like this to be foolish and have unprotected sex, but as she says later on, "I don't know what kind of girl I am."<br /><br />The baby's father is her best friend, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera), a quiet, lanky teen who loves Tic Tacs and has a passion for running. One gets the sense that he doesn't actually say most of what he's thinking; when Juno tells him that she's pregnant because of that one night, all he can think to say is, "Whose idea was it?" In Juno's eyes, he's just about the coolest guy on the planet. But she knows that he's not ready to be a parent, and as it turns out, neither is she. This is probably why they both agree that an abortion is the best idea. Of course, Juno is unable to go through with it by the time she reaches the clinic; she said that it smelled like a dentist's office, and she couldn't stand the girl at the help desk (a goth-type who offers her a boysenberry-scented condom). With abortion no longer an option, she settles on giving the baby up for adoption.<br /><br />And as it happens, an ad in the Pennysaver shows a black and white photo of a couple looking to adopt. Here enter Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa Loring (Jennifer Garner), who live in an upscale gated community. As is the case with a lot of couples, their attempts to conceive have been unsuccessful; Jennifer is desperate to be a mother, and Mark seems ready and willing to be a father. When Juno enters their lives, they agree on a closed-door policy, meaning that Juno wants absolutely nothing to do with the baby after it's born: she doesn't want the Lorings to keep in touch with her or to send her updates. With everything seemingly set in stone, the papers are signed and the deals are made.<br /><br />Things start to change when Juno has her first ultrasound. She immediately drives back to the Lorings' home, hoping to show them a picture of their unborn baby. Because only Mark is home, an unlikely friendship is kick started: they have the same tastes in music (although they disagree about the best year for punk rock--Mark says 1992 while Juno says 1977); they both play electric guitars, Juno having been part of a band and Mark being an advertisement composer; they both love excessively gory horror films, and Mark convinces Juno that the films of Dario Argento are tame compared to the films of Herschell Gordon Lewis. All this seems innocent enough, but don't you already get the sense that something inappropriate is going on here? Not inappropriate in the sexual sense, but definitely in the sense that neither Juno nor Mark are setting up boundaries. He will, after all, be parenting her child; forming a friendship will probably do more harm than good.<br /><br />And consider a moment when Juno and her girlfriend are at the mall: Juno sees Vanessa in the kids' area, energetically playing with one of her friend's young children. This makes Juno smile, because it's clear that Vanessa is serious about wanting to be a mother. The same can't be said for Mark, who may not, in fact, be ready to go through with an adoption. Keep in mind that he and Juno never speak about the baby or even parenthood during one of her visits; all their conversations focus on personal interests, and as we all know, personal interests have absolutely no place in the life of a parent. This eventually begins to bring Juno down, threatening to destroy her already limited faith in humanity.<br /><br />All this affects her relationship with Paulie, who doesn't understand what it's like to be a pregnant high school student. Not only does everyone clear away from her as she walks down the hall, they also stare uncontrollably at her swelling stomach. Nevertheless, she begins to suspect that her feelings for Paulie may run deeper than she first thought, which forces her to put her life into perspective: while she may not always get along with her father (J.K. Simmons) and stepmother (Allison Janney), and while home may sometimes get hectic, the reality is that it's still home, and as the saying goes, home is where the heart is.<br /><br />What exactly would a film like this have to offer the everyday person? I questioned that many times as I watched, and my initial conclusion was, "Not a heck of a lot." This is, after all, an oddball film about an oddball character in an oddball situation. But as I left the theater and began the drive home, my thoughts gradually shifted, and I began to realize that this film offers quite a lot. It cleverly shows that life is always in a state of flux, and no matter what we do to prepare, some unexpected things will happen. Granted, this is not a new idea, but considering how well made this film is--how relatable the characters are (if a little strange) and how nicely the story unfolds--it doesn't really matter.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>It starts as one of those everyday dramas, a teenage girl finds herself pregnant. Her first thought is to end the pregnancy but, when the time comes, she shies and bolts from the clinic for no rational reason. Instead, she decides to bring the baby to term and find a good home for it.<br /><br />Even when she's as big as "a planet" (and equally inhabited), Juno keeps her sassy attitude and sarcastic humor. Her character, played wonderfully well by Ellen Page, carries the movie with her one-liners and attitude. Like the other characters, Juno comes across as complex and believable, fragile and resilient at the same time. Her social world seems true too, almost a closed society of teenagers with incidental and often uncomfortable interactions with the adults.<br /><br />This might be the most improbable feel-good movie ever. In fact that would be the one criticism I'd offer, that it seems a bit more "cleaned up" than I'd expect many lives to be. The teenagers are goofy, gawky, and uncertain, but never show the vicious edge that comes out way too frequently. Her whole world is largely supportive, or at least benign. I don't wish a pregnancy on any teenager, but I'd wish that kind of support for any who do end up as mommy-to-be, the kind of support that too few girls in trouble seem to get. That happy background keeps makes the comedy possible, and the edgy humor makes this movie succeed.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>Her parents didn't see it coming.  They were hoping she'd been expelled, into hard drugs, anything but pregnant.<br /><br />Well, Juno (Ellen Page) was hoping that, too.  It took 3 pregnancy tests to convince her.<br /><br />Juno tried the abortion clinic first, but couldn't go through with it.  Her friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby) convinces her to check out the Penny Saver for adoptive parents--or as she puts it couples 'desperately seeking spawn.'<br /><br />She finds Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa (Jennifer Garner), who seem to be the ideal couple.  Vanessa has always wanted to be a Mom--and Juno and Mark have so much in common.<br /><br />"Juno" takes us through a year of young Juno's life, including her relations with the father of her baby and her best friend, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera), school, and the pregnancy and aftermath.<br /><br />The film takes you on the gamut of emotions, but leaves you feeling good. I saw this film with my husband, who loved "Juno" as much as I did.  We'll probably end up buying this DVD, because it's well worth another watch.<br /><br />Warnings:<br /><br />Some mature subject themes may not be suitable for really young kids, but I'd definitely take my young adults to this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>Juno is a tale which starts out a little annoying, but by the end of the film,, it wins you over.

The smug attitude of the young girls turned me off as a person looking in from the outside, but once the movie gets going and the characters are fleshed out, I enjoyed this quirkly little film and the excellent cast. The story is real and everything rings true. It's a film well worth your time and money. The single disc version is very good with an excellent transfer and some interesting extra material.</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>Sorry folks, but I don't consider this movie to be the kind of work that has reality in play.<br /><br />Yes, Juno is funny and entertaining, but the main character's dialogue is too polished, too witty, and too "written down" to make the movie anything near believable.<br /><br />Pregnant teenagers can be witty, just not all the time!<br /><br />I write a teen column for a living; it is almost absurd for anyone to believe Juno offers a sincere look at real life.  The issues the young lady has to deal with are SERIOUS, SCARY, and NOT SO POLISHED.<br /><br />Is this a DVD I plan to purchase?  Yes.  Is this a DVD that I think everyone should own?

Juno is faced with the task of trying to decide whether to have an abortion or give her unborn child up for adoption. But ends up deciding to give up her baby for adoption and goes about finding the perfect parents to adopt her unborn child.<br /><br />Juno Macguff isn't your average teenage beauty involved in sports, cheerleading & so on... She's into music and is funny in a dry/witty/dark humor kind of way.... Ellen Page plays the character perfectly and is in fact, the best actor in the movie! I think Ellen Page will remain on the acting scene for a long time with her talent.<br /><br />Anyway, "Juno" is definitely a different sort of coming of age story and a good one at that.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>I thought Juno was an interesting film overall. Ellen Page is absolutely magnificent in the central role and Michael Cera fit well the part he plays. Personally, I was a bit skeptical of Juno's essence as a character. She struck me as being partially a male fantasy of what a girl would be like as it's improbable that a high school kid nowadays would have anywhere near the type of musical education she possesses (or walk around with an unlit pipe in her mouth). Page's Juno is highly engaging as a personality and it's hard to take your eyes off of her though. Also, I thought Jennifer Garner and Justin Bateman put in solid backup performances. Juno is entertaining and fun even if its intricacies sometimes make it a challenge to suspend disbelief.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this film.

There really are some smart, witty people out there with quick wits and good vocabularies.<br /><br />Performances are uniformly great.  Page is wonderful and Bateman continues to impress as he ages.

I used to love Arrested Development, and was surprised to see the father and son from that show both playing major roles in the movie, and of course, the beautiful Jennifer Garner, and the best surprise of all, the teenage daughter, who was the lead actrees, named Ellen Page.  She was funny, witty, and interesting the entire time.  I loved her role and expect to see more of her in the future.<br /><br />A VERY good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>This film was talk about town because it tackles the hot topic of teenage pregnancy. Juno is 16 year old girl, curious about sex, who after one time experiment with her schoolmate finds out she is pregnant.  Juno is pretty, smart and has sarcastic sense of humor.  Her mother and father are divorced and remarried to other people.  While Juno lives with her father (somewhere in Midwest), her Mom has started her new family in Arizona and it is obvious that their relationship is distant and strained.  Juno's family is a typical lower class family.  Her father repairs heating and air conditioning, her stepmom is working as a nail technician while juggling her new family.  But they are all detached from the fact that Juno is approaching age when talking about sex and educating her about it long past due.  It is cute to see how her parents take her pregnancy in stride, but to me it is not believable that they would be so galant about it.  The wisecracking of young Juno makes her somewhat less appealing becuase she can be crass.  One almost does not want a girl like that to be a mother at all.  Sarcasm like that is underlining major unhappiness and babies sure can benefit from happy moms.  Besides, I do not believe that small town America talks the way most people talk and behave in this movie.  While the script adds on the entertainment value it just isn't real.  For some reason, I found soundtrack on thsi movie annoying.  I know that many people have found it cute becuase it is so off beat, but I like music that sounds pleasing, not baby talk bluring sounds with a cute background noise.  Let's hope young girls learn something from this film (I am not trying to be a prude when I say this)- in that respect I think that film adds value to a new generation of young women whose parents are in denial about their sexual coming of age.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Yes, it's all very cute.  The neighborhoods, the people, the blue drinks, and so on--cute as heck and really adorable and sometimes funny. But believable?  No, not quite.<br /> I couldn't believe that Juno went back with Paulie at the end and that they sat there singing a happy song as if nothing serious had happened in their young lives.  It was hard to believe that Juno would actually make a phone call about getting an abortion and then scare herself off just because of the thought that the baby had fingernails already.  I couldn't believe that Juno's dad and stepmother were so cool with the whole thing.  That's not the normal reaction from most people in such a situation.<br /><br />The music got on my nerves as well.  Every five frakking minutes, there was another off-key indie song being sung.  It was quite annoying after a while.<br /><br />Was there a reason for Liberty Bell to be in the movie at all?  She was basically a piece of furniture.<br /><br />RE: the dialogue:  okay, sarcastic and self-aware and snappy is fun for a few minutes.  I'm sure it was fun to write.  But come on....do people talk that way that frequently?  I couldn't believe that either.<br /><br />Into the Wild deserved a nomination far more than this film did.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>"All I notice is those `pork swords'"<br /><br />Juno (Ellen Page) walks around taking swigs from the largest bottle of Sunny Delite you will ever see. She hurries into a convenience store and purchases a pregnancy test from the clerk (Rainn Wilson, TV's "The Office"). Her fears are realized. She is pregnant after having sex for the first time with Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera, "Superbad", TV's "Arrested Development"). She tells her father Mac McGuff (J.K. Simmons) and step-mom Bree (Allison Janney) and decides she wants to have the baby, but give it up for adoption. Enter the perfect couple, who are unable to conceive, Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner, Justin Bateman). As the pregnancy progresses, Juno has trouble with her feelings for Paulie and the perfect couple have problems of their own.<br /><br />I know. From the description I just relayed, "Juno" sounds like an afternoon special, a precautionary tale, a drama. It couldn't be any more different than that. Director Jason Reitman ("Thank You for Smoking") takes a screenplay by first time writer Diablo Cody, a former exotic dancer, and creates one of the funniest films I have seen this year. Much like the equally funny "Lars and the Real Girl", both films take characters who are off center, but believable, and allow us to watch as they use humor to deal with difficult situations.<br /><br />"Juno" works so well because Juno is so believable. She seems like your average rebellious teenager. Ready and willing to act out, albeit mildly, she is just a teen girl trying to figure things out. So when she is in a band with Paulie, and there seems to be an attraction, he might be the right guy to try sex with for the first time. He is also attracted to her, so he agrees. They are testing out sex together. As Juno relates these events, she provides us with amusing insights, noticing Paulie's addiction to Orange TicTacs for instance. Also, Paulie is on the Junior High running team, so she seems to notice eight or nine of his team mates running by her, wearing their short gold running shorts, their "pork swords" moving underneath, at all times. This is a constant running joke, no pun intended, because Paulie's teammates always seem to be running by Juno whenever she is outside, emphasizing the fact she is noticing boys for the first time in her life.<br /><br />JK Simmons and Allison Janney are also very good as her parents. As each is introduced to us by Juno, she also provides amusing antidotes for them as well. For instance, we learn her step-mom Bree (Janney) runs a manicure salon, so Bree, like all people who are preoccupied with the one thing they are good at, talks about nails, and manicures, and everything related to it, sneaking in these references as much as possible. When she takes Juno to see a doctor, and the doctor prescribes a particular vitamin, Bree quickly notes how this helps to make nails stronger. Their reaction to Juno's news about the pregnancy is also very funny.<br /><br />Michael Cera is very good as Paulie, a smart kid, member of the track team and a kid who seems genuinely interested in Juno as a girlfriend, but also as a friend. They really seem to get along together and Paulie is attracted to her. Because he is so sweet, and good-natured, he is also extremely likable. His mother, who clearly doesn't like Juno, puts up with her because she knows her son is attracted to her. He usually makes good decisions, so she gives him the benefit of the doubt. But she isn't beyond giving Juno a dead stare any time she comes to the house. But Juno knows this will happen and simply ignores her until she retreats to Paulie's sanctuary, his bedroom. There, she feels safe.<br /><br />When the two get together, they look at each other, regarding each other with interest, yet unsure how to express this. There is hunger in their eyes, but they haven't had enough experience to know this is a natural thing. Yet.<br /><br />Michael Cera makes Paulie interesting because he is clearly going through the same problems all teenage males go through, yet he doesn't quite seem to have the angst we are used to seeing in film characters.<br /><br />Mac accompanies his daughter to their first meeting with Vanessa and Mark, to make sure they don't take advantage of his daughter. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman play the perfect couple. Vanessa feels she was born to be a mother and is kind of desperate to have a baby. Mark seems less gung-ho, but is willing to go along because it is what his wife wants.<br /><br />Vanessa is also a bit weary because they have tried to adopt before only to have the birth mother back out at the last minute. The desperation is very clear, something she is unable to hide with her wide smile. Mark tries to help her deal, but he also seems a bit ambivalent about the whole thing. Or maybe he is just tired.<br /><br />As the pregnancy progresses, Juno decides to drop by and keep the adoptive couple up to date. As she sees more of them, she learns more about them and realizes there are some cracks in the perfect fa?ade. On one of these visits, Juno finds Mark at home alone and learns about some of his hobbies; they have an argument about horror films and Mark shows her one of his favorites. But he is quick to try to rush her out of the house when Vanessa returns home from work.<br /><br />What makes Mark and Vanessa so interesting is a level of unease hinted at throughout their relationship. Mark is concerned about Vanessa finding Juno in their house. Vanessa is desperate to have a child, because they can't seem to conceive. There are other moments which subtly reveal things about Mark and Vanessa, showing that perhaps they aren't as perfect as they seem.<br /><br />Director Jason Reitman, son of Ivan, director of "Ghostbusters", "Dave" and many other memorable comedy blockbusters, seems to have a career in his own right. His debut feature "Thank You for Smoking" was a dark comedy based on the book by Christopher Buckley. A very funny look at the lobbying industry, starring Aaron Eckhart and Catherine Keener, among others, "Smoking" was easily one of the best of that year. Now, Reitman follows with "Juno". Both films share an oddball sense of humor, a skewed way of looking at the universe which helps to make the films and stories more interesting. Reitman isn't afraid to let his characters say what they should, nee what they need to, whether it is PC or not. Because of this, his characters seem more real, even though they are incredibly well-spoken and well-versed.<br /><br />In "Juno", Reitman seems to have found his muse in Ellen Page. As Juno, Page narrates the film providing many insights, acting as the voice for the director and writer. Because she is a teenage girl, her voice is deadpan and frequently conveys she could care less about what she is experiencing. This fits perfectly for her character; a teenager would share these same feelings. Frequently, as she makes an observation, trying to act disdainful of the feeling, she secretly betrays herself and reveals she is excited or afraid or unsure, even if just a little.<br /><br />Reitman and his cast deserve a lot of the credit for making this film work. But the first time screenwriter, Diablo Cody, has also done a remarkable job. From what I understand, Cody, a former exotic dancer of some sort, decided she wanted to become a screenwriter and came up with "Juno", her first screenplay, which was produced virtually unchanged. She provides these characters with unusual, interesting voices, making the film very funny.<br /><br />Her observations of characters, especially Bree and the Lorings, help to make the film come alive. With these casual asides, we actually learn a lot about the people and what makes them tick. None of them are completely bad; none of them are completely good either.<br /><br />Also, just when it seems like Cody could take the obvious route, making fun of Vanessa and Mark, or Juno's parents, the screenwriter leads us to suspect this is about to happen only to change course and make us laugh at something unexpected. That takes talent.<br /><br />"Juno" is a very good film, one of the year's best comedies. Filled with interesting, off-center characters dealing with difficult situations in the way they know best; with humor.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>I wanted to hate Juno so bad.  I suppose all of the trendy dialogue and often unnecessary indie credibility made me want to target this as among the most overrated films of 2007.  In retrospect I hate when I have preconceptions going into a film but at least here I can admit its impact.  Juno isn't overrated at all and although the dialogue is still hard to believe in flashes; the characters were compelling, enjoyable, and very easy to like.  It was a simple task to forgive the few flaws I expected to find.<br /><br />The film is directed by Jason Reitman (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0MKOC">Thank You for Smoking</a>), the son of director Ivan Reitman (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000060K4O">Ghostbusters</a>).  It is written by Diablo Cody, a known blogger who won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay for Juno.  The film's cast is actually very deep for its modest budget of $7 million dollars.  The cast includes Ellen Page in the title role, Michael Cera as her quasi-boyfriend and father-to-be, Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner as the would-be adoptive parents of Juno's daughter, and J.K. Simmons as Juno's father, among others.  It always surprises me when J.K. Simmons appears in a role as a nice guy after seeing him play an imprisoned Aryan gang leader for years on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6BL42">Oz</a> and the fiery J. Jonah Jameson in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UR9T82">Spider-Man movies</a>.  He is always an outstanding supporting actor.<br /><br />Juno follows a young girl named Juno MacGuff (Page) who discovers she is pregnant.  The film looks the issue of abortion right in the face, for better or worse, seemingly indifferent to the views of either side, and eventually Juno decides she will have the child and put it up for adoption.  Mark and Vanessa Loring (Bateman and Garner) are a married thirty-something couple that want to adopt the child.  Juno's interactions with both Mark and Vanessa are engaging and surprisingly fresh.  The supporting characters are very strong and make the main characters even more enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />The strength of Juno's character seems to be one of the film's contentious points.  Everyone seems to agree that Page is amazing in the role, and she is, but the way the character is written was something I expected to tackle as a flaw.  It isn't at all; she is a powerful, intelligent, and confident young woman who I found not only believable but completely original.  But there are many reasons to recommend Juno.  It's well-written, it contains some great performances, and it has a soundtrack and style I appreciated very much.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>Look, abortion is nasty business. It should be legal, but rarely used. I guess that's the essence of "Choice." I wish women too drunk or stupid to know when to say "no" would, but then we'd have a perfect world. (Naturally, they should never say no to me.) I liked Juno. All the characters are appealing and real enough. I particularly enjoyed Juno's dad and tough cookie-step-mom. I thought Jason Bateman hit the right notes as an immature rock and roll wanna be married to a serious yup woman, Jen Gardner. I'm glad he didn't put an aggressive move on Juno because this wouldn't be a feel good flick anymore.<br /><br />The Dawson Creek, super smart teen characters with big vocabularies, well, I don't know. Sometimes Juno was way to smart to have been so stupid, so it works against the script. On the other hand, brilliant people do adolescent disasters too. My guess is: the film would have been fine if Juno and her girlfriend had average every day teen vocabs.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>The screwball comedy was a staple in theaters when movies first discovered sound. The antics of Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart and a ton of other actors made audiences laugh and weep and in general have a good time at the box office. This genre comes to life once more with the release of JUNO.<br /><br />Juno (Ellen Page) is a typical teen for the most part. As opposed to most films that center the attention around the cheerleader (face it, percentage wise how many teens are actually cheerleaders?), Juno is a normal student who has a strong attachment to her best friend, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). So much so that she seduces him and the two share their first intimate moment with one another. With, for them, unexpected results.<br /><br />Yes, Juno ends up pregnant. She lets her parents in on what has happened and the pair offers her support as opposed to verbal abuse. Visiting a local abortion clinic, she thinks twice and decides instead to have the baby. Their support helps her to locate a nice couple seeking to adopt in an upper middle class home.<br /><br />As Juno's pregnancy continues, she keeps in touch with the couple, letting them know what's going on. She also begins to bond with the husband (Jason Bateman) who she shares interests with in music and movies.  The wife (Jennifer Garner) just sees Juno as the mother carrying the child that she so desperately wants.<br /><br />As the film progresses, we are given a look at this young lady who is facing a crisis in a more level headed manner than we would expect, not only from those in real life but from film lives as well. Juno jokes about her pregnancy, sarcastically spills out about her less than supportive boyfriend and discusses life in general. She is one of the most well rounded characters seen on film in some time and it was a delight to glimpse this life.<br /><br />The film progresses to a point where we discover all is not well with the "perfect family" Juno has chosen for her child. It's a revelatory moment that affects not only the couple involved but Juno as well. It's a discovery that the world is a difficult place to find perfection in no matter how much you desire it.<br /><br />The ending of the film is fantastic. No quick solutions, no movie filled dream sequence where everything turns out the way a Hollywood writer would want it to be. No, this time we are offered a chance to see a real solution where there is a happy ending, just not the one you expected.<br /><br />This low budget gem arrived in theaters and was hailed by critics and fans alike and understandably so. It feels fresher than anything seen in months, perhaps years. The look of the film is great, the direction is top notch and the acting is some of the best seen lately. Low key when needed and abrupt at others, all of the actors involved deserve notices for a job well done.<br /><br />Outstanding from the rest is Page as Juno. Having made a name for herself in the revenge drama HARD CANDY, she shows a different side here in the smart mouthed, in over her head Juno. She carries off this character as if she were portraying herself rather than someone written. It is her performance that centers this film and makes it a gift.<br /><br />JUNO is not your typical pregnant teen flick. It's more than that. It's a glimpse of life as it is, life as it can be as opposed to the two options most Hollywood films offer of dysfunctional families of happy ever after marriages. The movie shows real life in a pleasant way, and isn't that what it's usually all about?</p></br><a href="../users/A37S3ACL57LN62.html">A37S3ACL57LN62</a><br/><p>Let me say that just because a movie's dialogue sometimes captures the way people really talk does not mean it is Oscar worthy. There are plenty of other films that do the same thing and are never even considered for Oscars. Additionally, this movie's script ranges from the utterly typical to the overly thought-out in which case is equally un-Oscar worthy. What should be rewarded, instead, is consistency, and this movie lacks that in spades.<br /><br />Juno (Ellen Page) is a somewhat masculine and alternately strange 16 year old girl with the inability to understand herself and the people around her. She discovers she is pregnant with the child of an awkward friend (Michael Cera) and immediately decides to have an abortion. Without much consultation from the father of the baby, she heads down to the clinic to discover a schoolmate protesting the murder of babies that already have fingernails. Juno changes her mind, and with the help of her best friend (Olivia Thirlby) searches for needy couples in the Penny Saver. She finds her perfect match, a wealthy duo (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner) who have been trying for years to conceive without any luck. Upon meeting them, she signs her baby away and that is that. However, a strange connection is formed between Juno and her future baby's daddy which throws a wrench into the situation.<br /><br />An entertaining though somewhat boring romp about teen pregnancy, Juno makes us laugh with its quips and wacky situations but it is hardly cutting edge. With funnier and more memorable movies like Saved! and Knocked Up coming before it, Juno is by now a typical story that cannot be redeemed with its slightly less typical characters. Enjoyable, yes, but outstanding, no.<br /><br />This DVD features some unfunny deleted scenes and gag reels. The one and only gem is a scene with the old woman who threw out a living room set who says, "Jesus loves all colors, except Mexican."</p></br><a href="../users/A5KJVGJ43ZDC9.html">A5KJVGJ43ZDC9</a><br/><p>I can't lose lately. Only running into a couple of stinkers here and there like "The Mist", but this year I get "No Country For Old Men", "There Will Be Blood", and now Juno. This is the sweetest, smartest comedy/love story I've seen in...I don't know how long. Awesome soundtrack, great actors, just great great great. If you didn't like this movie just a little, you are a sad, sad, retarded person with severe taste deficiencies, and you probably like to project your own sorry life onto the characters and criticize them for their choices, just like you do with every other movie you watch. Oh, well. The rest of us will enjoy it for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>You will be hooked. Page is smart and sassy. Can Juno truly simply walk away and play music? Enough depth to this to keep you talking for a while. Very well done.</p></br><a href="../users/AFV2584U13XP3.html">AFV2584U13XP3</a><br/><p>I'm sorry but this movie was just two things for me annoying and idiotic re-make of much better movies before this one.  I'm sure most people know the storyline by now you have a young teenage girl Juno who after having sex gets pregnant and now after a while of thinking it over decides to have the baby full term and than give the baby up to a surrogate couple.  For me I couldn't seem to care less what happened to Juno or the baby I know it sounds mean but the storyline they used has been done over many times and a lot more better than this trashy movie.  The soundtrack also was pretty pathetic except for one or two but all in all the songs they used by this one singer Kimya Dawson made me want to put this dvd in the garbage disposer.  To people who are looking for a heart-felt movie similar to this I say try checking out Natalie Portman's movie Where The Heart Is I guarantee you that would be a much better choice than this cornball dvd.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Sixteen-year-old Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) has just discovered she is two months pregnant.  The father is her best friend, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera).  Her first thought, naturally, is to have an abortion.  But when she can't go through with that, she decides to find a nice couple to adopt it.<br /><br />Of course, finding Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner) was just the beginning.  She also has to tell her dad and step-mother (J. K. Simmons and Allison Janney).  And she has to carry the baby to term while attending classes at high school.  How will she handle the next few months?<br /><br />If you are thinking about seeing this film, you should take the PG-13 rating seriously.  The movie, especially the first third, is filled with crude language and talk about sex.  I expected that going in, but it still made me cringe.<br /><br />Fortunately, once the movie gets going those things are kept to a minimum.  The story is only slightly realistic, but I got so caught up in it I really didn't care.  They even manage to throw in a twist or two to make the movie unpredictable.<br /><br />This movie works because of the characters.  You absolutely love them from the start and want things to work out well for them.  And the characters work because the acting is universally great.  Ellen Page deserved his Oscar nomination.  In my eyes, the other standout is Jennifer Garner.  You could actually feel her character's longing to have a child.<br /><br />The movie is a comedy, and I did laugh out loud.  Most of the time, however, I chuckled and smiled.  Still, it had a warmth to it that was absolutely charming.<br /><br />Some critics have argued this movie glorifies teen pregnancy.  Frankly, that is a risk any movie runs when it tries to deal with a sensitive subject like this.  While it doesn't dwell on the negatives of the situation (hence my comment about the story not being realistic), it doesn't make things rosier then they are either.  In the end, it is a life affirming movie that is about people taking the twists and turns of life and dealing with them the best way they know how.<br /><br />And for that reason, I liked this movie.  Yes, the first third had me cringing more then I expected to.  But it was a film well worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Juno starring Ellen Page is delightfully hilarious but also frankly delicate especially the last half hour. Page is a talented actress, Juno came across immature at first but the character truly grows up before the viewers eyes. Michael Cera and Jennifer Garner really surprised me here, they hold their own around Page's dry wit. The dialogue is something else, you gotta hear it to believe it! And by the way a film cannot make you pregnant, so let's just set that myth straight. I highly recommend this too cool for its own good flick, enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Those who love Oprah will probably love this movie along with aficionados of daytime soap operas. The strategy of such movies is to give the characters a few quirks but make sure they all have hearts of gold. Juno is full of witty quips (improbable for most 16 year old's) and her boyfriend Bleeker loves tic-tacs (that's about all we found out about him throughout the entire movie).<br /><br />Juno's parents blandly accept her pregnancy and they have nothing much to do except wheel her into the maternity ward when she's about to give birth (funny how the father disappears for most of the movie--he's nothing more than a kind-hearted cheerleader for his daughter when we do get to see him).<br /><br />The screenwriter, Diablo Cody, takes a stab at creating an antagonist in the character of Mark Loring, who decides to divorce his wife and foil Juno's plans of having the couple adopt her baby. But even though he decides to leave, he's also still a good guy--albeit a person who simply needs to "find himself".<br /><br />Ultimately "Juno" doesn't have enough conflict to keep one's attention for a full hour and a half. Cody falls back on predictable, saccharine moments to fill the void. Did I forget to mention Jennifer Garner? Her 'Vanessa' is probably the dullest of all the characters in the movie.<br /><br />Many on this board who gave the film a low rating fault it for trivializing teen pregnancy. That might be true but the worse failing is the lack of character development coupled with a predictable and sentimental denouement.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>I've been meaning to see this 2007 award-winning film for a long time.  I'm glad I finally did.<br /><br />This is a comedy but it is more than that.  It is a heartwarming story of an off-beat and lovable 16-year old girl who becomes pregnant.  She is exceptionally wise and savvy with one of the most lovable personalities I have ever seen on the scene.  Ellen Page is cast in this role and is absolutely perfect for the part.  I don't think any other actor could have done as well.  I applaud her performance and want to just keep applauding.<br /><br />The screenplay is wonderful too and a great vehicle to showcase her acting.  It is heartwarming and not maudlin as we share her experiences with her understanding family and the prospective adoptive parents who she interviews and bonds with.  There is also good upbeat music throughout which supports the theme of the story.<br /><br />Yes, there are a few bumps along the way.  Her boyfriend invites a different girl to the prom.  The prospective adoptive father becomes enamored with Juno romantically.  She has to deal with her own bulging body and the stares of her classmates.  And there are times that her situation seems too much of a burden for her.<br /><br />This is a really fine film and I highly recommend it for everyone.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>I am in love with Juno, I really am. For me, Fox's Searchlight studio has become my personal favorite for extremly great indie comedies. They scored last year with Little Miss Sunshine (another film I absolutly love) and they do it again with Juno. But for me, I feel Juno really achieved something far greater then Little Miss Sunshine did. Not only did the film make me laugh but when I left the theater, I just couldn't help but feel uplifted and joyous. It's just one of those films that not only has a great wit but a real heart inside it. Something I did not feel with Knocked Up and Superbad and I know, people will hate me for saying that, but its true. For me, Juno was the only comedy that, I felt, really achieved the true 'heart' of a film.<br /><br />Now, most everyone is by now familiar with the story but i'll just do it again just to refresh those who have gone fuzzy. Juna MacGuff has just found out she is nine weeks pregnant, the father happening to be her longtime friend and admirer Paulie Bleaker. After originally thinking about an abortion, she has a last minute change of heart and decides to give the baby up for adoption to a family she looked up in the local Pennysaver. We are then taken through the entire process of Juno dealing with her pregnancy, the adoptive family, just really everyday life that a pregnant teen can go through.<br /><br />Now, I have been a fan of Ellen Page (Oscar Nominated this year, kudos) ever since I saw her in Hard Candy (a film that I felt really showed off her dramatic range), I just think she really is a talented young actress and true role model girls AND guys can look up to. As Juno, she combines a blend of biting wit, teen angst, and even motherly instinct into a fire cracker of a character. Another standout being Jennifer Garner, who just completly transforms her character from an icy, controling person to someone caring and warm by the end of the film. J.K. Simmons, Jason Batemen, Allison Janney, and Olivia Thirlby are also just as good, Thirlby I think having all the best lines.<br /><br />And of course, we cannot forget Diablo Cody, who crafted a heartful and witty screenplay from a topic that could have easily been just another run of the mill teen pregnancy film. If she dosen't win the Originally Screenplay Oscar, I will automatically call for a recount. As for Jason Reitman, I feel he does a good job directing this film, obviously having a flare for making smart comedies (like his previous effort, Thank You for Smoking, another great film from Searchlight) but I don't feel he should have been nominated for Best Director, I felt that the fifth slot really should have gone so Joe Wright (director of the beautiful Atonement) but still, I felt he did his job.<br /><br />I would definently place Juno on my top ten of 2007, cause for me it was one of the few highly praised films this year that I truley felt delivered on everything the critics praised about. But then again, I rarely agree with the critics, so even more props to the film that really connected with all audiences and not something that only the critics seemed to have got. So, if you truely, TRUELY, want to see a film that will not only make you laugh but give you that warm fuzzy feeling, Juno is definently the film to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>Warm, smart, and funny `Juno' is a sympathetic look at teen pregnancy.  Starting out during her consummation, the titled character (Ellen Page) shares the details of her infatuation with high school track star, Paulie Bleaker (Michael Cera, `Superbad'), takes it to her discovery of pregnancy (in the presence of a convenience store clerk, played acerbically by Rainn Wilson) until she follows through her decision resolving her "problem".<br /><br />Enthusiastic, but trying not to care so she won't get hurt, Juno comes across her pregnancy flippantly as a minor inconvenience.  Juno is named after Zeus's wife (technically Jupiter, but Hera's name wouldn't fit).  Her father named her as a self-fulfilling prophecy of her natural beauty.  Her dad (J.K. Simmons, Spiderman 3') is ex-military.  He's divorced, but married to a born-again Christian, whom he's found stability for ten years.  Her best friend, Ellen, is the only one on whom she confides, and her boyfriend is someone she hasn't quite locked down in her emotions.<br /><br />Juno knows her choices.  She is as innocent and na?ve as she is knowledgeable about what she could do with her baby.  Discerning what's given to her, she decides to have the baby and give it up for adoption.  She finds her potential couple in an advertisement flyer, but once her decision is made, she has to let her father and step-mother know.<br /><br />Much of the movie shows a perky Juno discovering the trek of her pregnancy.  The movie has such a natural tone and delivery from its characters, they seem like people we all know.  Juno gets to know the adopting couple from St. Cloud, MN, a relatively short trek from her own Twin Cities suburban home.  The film makes discoveries about her relationship to Paulie Bleaker and the details of the adopting couple (Here Jason Bateman's appearance brings a real time warp to the picture.) that seem organic and natural.  Ellen Page is so good with her role that I wouldn't leave out the possibility of an Oscar nomination.  Her range of emotions is good; the discoveries her character makes are believable; and her witty, fast-pitch lines are blurt-out funny.  Everyone else is identifiably genuine as well.<br /><br />While the old fashioned paradigm of the nursery rhyme comes leaping to mind, "First comes love, then comes marriage, then come..someone...in the baby carriage," real life, especially today, is often not like that.  Without much maliciousness--except for what normally comes to us--`Juno' leaves a lingering sweetness that isn't artificially enhanced.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Admittedly, it takes about 15 minutes to get used to the wise-talking (and in this case I not only mean smart-mouthed but literally wise from intelligence) chatter of 16 year old Juno (Ellen Page, who looks like the love child of Jeannine Garafalo and Billy Cruddup) who finds herself pregnant. But whereas in most stories of this ilk, Juno is not without emotional resources: a wise, loving father and step mother (J.K. Simmons and the redoubtable Allison Janney) and a good friend...all three of whom are more than eager to offer advice. Juno attempts to have an abortion, can't do it and decides to give up her child for adoption. She scans the "Recycler" and finds a couple played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman who on several levels are less mature than Juno.<br />Director Jason Reitman (the terrific "Thank You for Smoking") and writer Diablo Cody are walking a slippery slope here: how do you make an unwed teenage mother with a smart mouth and a penchant for talking smack non-stop a la Holden Caulfield into someone who not only holds your attention but eventually steals your heart?<br />The Movies are peppered with a number of teenaged savants dating back many years with such notable examples as DeeDee (Christina Ricci in "The Opposite of Sex" to whom the moviemakers tip their hat as a precursor to Juno) and Harry Potter spouting profoundly about all manner of Life situations: in possession of learned and thoughtful opinions way, way beyond their years and life experience. Now we have Juno to add to that list.<br />"Juno" is at times very funny: not only in a ha ha sense but more importantly, cosmically and philosophically in a structured world view sense. A 16 year old without the common sense to use contraception yet intuitive and perceptive enough to wax poetically about Iggy Pop and Dario Argento? Yup: that's our Juno!</p></br><a href="../users/A359IT81FBX64Y.html">A359IT81FBX64Y</a><br/><p>The people who like Juno outnumber those who don't 3 to 1. I'm in the minority. At times it's cute and amusing, and the acting is good. It's a quirky story filled with quirky characters, but even with all the quirks it is neither complex nor endearing.<br /><br />Juno is a preternaturally intelligent, precocious, attractive 16-year-old teen who makes up her own rules. Apparently no one can control or even influence her, not her tough, gruff father, not her tough, gruff step-mother, not her school, not her best friend or her boyfriend. But before too long we discover that Juno cares too much, that her rude, tough, pushy, arrogant, disdainful, manipulative exterior is masking a real softie inside. How original is that?<br /><br />To mix things up a bit, in a transparent effort to make up something "original" about the story, Juno decides one day to have sex with her boyfriend. Keep in mind that the most endearing quality about the boyfriend is that he is a totally passive pushover and is easily manipulated by Juno. It is Juno's idea to have sex, and when Juno says she wants sex, the boyfriend, Bleeker, has little say in the matter. Appropriately enough, the seminal act, as it were, is concluded not by smoking cigarettes, but by eating Tic Tacs (one of the many quirks of the film). Of course it was unprotected sex, because as I said, Juno makes up her own rules.<br /><br />Juno gets pregnant and she decides to give the baby to a set of parents of her own personal choosing. Juno's father helps her with the interviews, apparently accustomed to letting his daughter have her way. Juno quickly finds the perfect couple, and she can't wait to dump the unwanted baby on them, almost as if she has found a family to take a pet dog she's had for a month and now has grown bored with. Throughout the pregnancy, Juno continues to be the rude, rule-breaking person she's always been, though here and there we see glimpses of her softer side. She mostly ignores her boyfriend, who never really was a boyfriend anyway.<br /><br />The rest of the story is quite boring, the end is quite silly. But the movie is too earnest to be a comedy, though I have no idea what it is being earnest about. I don't think it's necessary to say more, except that, in the end, after the baby has been given away, Juno inexplicably decides that she, at 16, is suddenly in love with Bleeker, and no one is more surprised than Bleeker himself. It seems that even though Juno prefers to make up her own rules and break everyone else's, there is, after all, one rule that she would like to believe in: the rule of happily ever after. And if that doesn't make sense after what I've described before, it's not supposed to. :-)<br /><br />For those of you looking for a good, earnest, quirky movie about first love, I would suggest The Sterile Cuckoo with Liza Minnelli. It's an old movie (1969) and may be hard to find. The novel by John Nichols is good, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Let's face it -- teen pregnancy is an ongoing problem, and is not something admirable or funny. But I have to admit, the way you handle it can be.<br /><br />That seems to be the goal of "Juno," a relentlessly quirky, cracking-wise little comedy about a girl who makes a dumb mistake, and the smart decisions she has to make after that. While it initially seems rather precious, the Wes Andersonesque scriptings hide a bittersweet, warm little story about responsibility and love.<br /><br />After a lot of Sunny D and three pregnancy tests, Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) comes to the inevitable conclusion: she's pregnant by her friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera).<br /><br />Because she "heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant," Juno initially goes in for an abortion, but ends up running out of the clinic. Instead, she's going to have the baby and give it to someone who wants one, but can't have it. So she reluctantly fesses up to her parents, and starts scouting ads for suitably (if unedgy) parents for her baby -- the wealthy Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa (Jennifer Garner).<br /><br />Mark and Juno form a bond over their shared tastes, but she starts to suspect that not all is well in Yuppieland -- especially when Mark decides to break up with Vanessa, because fatherhood would force him to be a grown-up, not a rock god. As her due date approaches, Juno must decide what is best for herself, Vanessa, the baby... and just maybe, the adoring Paulie.<br /><br />Recliners on the lawn, cactus-grams, guitars with names and "The Wizard of Gore" -- it's pretty obvious that "Juno" will win prizes for kooky quirk, if nothing else. It certainly has that in spades, and while it has some awkwardly scripted moments, the colourful and acerbic portrait of a teenage girl having to make some heavy adult decisions is definitely a winning one.<br /><br />Admittedly, "Juno" is a bit too precious in the first few scenes, when we have a weird store clerk saying things like "Your eggo is preggo" and getting replies like "Silencio!" Come on, loosen up and stop trying to be cooler-than-thou.<br /><br />But as the pregnancy storyline really kicks in, "Juno" settles into a storyline that is equal parts quirky-funny and touching. Jason Reitman flavours the whole plot with his snappy, clever direction with plenty of acid-laced voiceovers from Juno, on the world around her. And Diablo Cody's dialogue ranges from deliciously sharp ("I'm not crying, I'm just allergic to fine home furnishing") to entertainingly over-the-top ("Phuket, Thailand!").<br /><br />But as witty and quirky as the plot is, it wouldn't be much if it didn't also have a heart. As the movie winds on, we get to see Juno maturing -- learning to weigh coolness vs. maturity, appreciate her family, and what is right for her baby and the Lorings -- the scene where Juno helps an upset Vanessa talk to her baby is adorable. Not to mention that our pregnant heroine has to figure out whether true love is staring her in the face.<br /><br />Ellen Page gives a note-perfect performance -- her Juno is funny, sassy, wise beyond her years, and profoundly unconventional ("Thundercats are go!"). Cera is equally good in a more subdued, lovably dorky role; it's pretty hard not to love Paulie just for being himself. And Garner and Bateman are wonderful too, as an uptight, lonely woman who desperately wants a baby, and a Peter Pan type who doesn't want to act like a grown-up. Bleah, who needs him?<br /><br />"Juno" has its flaws -- moments of excessive preciousness -- but it has plenty of heart, wicked dialogue, and excellent acting. Call it a Cautionary Whale.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>It was weird to watch this with my daughter, who is just about the age of the girl in this film.  What is so wonderful about the film is that it truly gets to the essence of how a child would experience a pregnancy that was a mistake.  On the verge of getting an abortion, she decides to have the child and finds a local family for it.  Then she goes on with her life, muddling through like so many high school students.  It is believable, moving, funny, disturbing, and uplifting, a wonderful stimulus to dialogue between generations.  The ending is a little la-di-dah with newfound love, there are perhaps not enough emotional consequences - but that might be the point, when she and her boyfriend do not even want to see the baby - but it is genuinely beautiful in its own way.  The acting is absolutely superb, with all the pain and confusion of adolescents dealing (or not) with adult issues.<br /><br />REcommended warmly.</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>Parents this calm after their daughter gets knocked up by some momma's boy......lame and stupid.  This film tries to be humerous and fails, tries to be serious and fails and trys to be a film and fails.  As one reviwer said "sassy pregnant teenage girls are so cool"<br /><br />I agree with the negitive reviews.  This film is for the sterotypical "Let's overrate stupid movies people".  This film has a plot and dialogue so stupid it makes my brain hurt.  This is alose the garbage that gets nominated for an oscar (anyone who's had to sit threw this film and can string two words together knows what I mean). You wonder how some films get made, or get good reviews when they are complete waste's of film, it's because of those people who love overhyped crappy movies. They will probally demand a sequel or a TV series. I can see it now "Juno II: Here We Go Again and Juno III: Third Times A Charm ***** two thumbs up amazing! Breath-taking!" GARBAGE!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3P9D22KDEXVMN.html">A3P9D22KDEXVMN</a><br/><p>Juno is a sweet movie with some very adult themes.  The adult themes involve teenage pregnancy, abortion, adoption, and adultery.  The story is told in such a fun and forthright manner, featuring some exceptional acting from Ellen Page and Michael Cera, that you get the feeling you are peeking in on real people.  A joy to watch and a memorable movie, it is no wonder that the film did so well with critics and at the Academy Awards.  A warm and gentle movie with some very heavy themes.  A 5 star film that is well-worth watching a couple of times.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>I have to admit that when I see a preview for a movie about a pregnant teenager, my first thought always goes back to conventional Lifetime TV soapers like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008MTXK">Fifteen and Pregnant</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ASATTY">Mom at Sixteen</a>. However, director Jason Reitman (who proved to have a wry, ironic eye with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0MKOC">Thank You for Smoking</a>) and first-time screenwriter Diablo Cody, who previously worked as a stripper and phone sex operator, have concocted a genuinely quirky, surprisingly tender dramedy that takes the clich&eacute;-ridden story idea and fleshes it out with so many recognizable idiosyncrasies and so much insightful wit that the subgenre feels reborn.<br /><br />The plot centers on a suburban Minneapolis sixteen-year old named Juno MacGuff, who finds herself pregnant after an experiment in chair-bound seduction with her shy classmate, a geeky, Tic-Tac-popping runner named Paulie Bleeker. Instead of focusing on dramatic confrontations with the parents or morphing into a diatribe on the right-to-life-or-choose debate, Reitman and Cody follow Juno's natural emotional impulses as she awkwardly attempts to figure out the best course of action to take. Things start to look promising when Juno finds a young upscale couple to adopt her baby - Vanessa is a controlling professional with perfectionist tendencies, while her husband Mark is an easy-going composer of commercial jingles, an aging Peter Pan-type whom Juno sees as a kindred spirit with a mutual fondness for rock music, slasher movies and comic books.<br /><br />What I particularly like about the movie is how it portrays Juno as someone who holds no illusion of becoming a mother and yet discovers the emotional intelligence to match her maddeningly clever smart-mouthing. In fact, I had concerns about the persistence of the slang-heavy dialogue at the outset but was relieved to find the movie settle into sharp bantering exchanges that make way for more human dimensions. As proven with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7VHQE">Little Miss Sunshine</a> and Lars and the Real Girl, a perfectly compatible ensemble can make all the difference with a movie as character-rich as this one. Fortunately, the cast is terrific starting with Ellen Page's prodigious turn in the title role. As a follow-up to her knockout work in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GI3KGC">Hard Candy</a>, she is impressive in revealing a fearless vulnerability under her character's disconcerting self-possession. As Bleeker, Michael Cera nicely provides a quiet gravity in response to Juno's volatility.<br /><br />There is great work by J.K. Simmons as Juno's no-nonsense dad and especially Allison Janney as her acid-tongued, dog-loving stepmother (her verbal teardown of the patronizing ultrasound technician is classic). The surprise comes from the sturdy work by Jason Bateman, bringing palpable, almost wistful regret to Mark, and the gorgeous Jennifer Garner truly affecting in conveying Vanessa's unfulfilled state. More predictable are Olivia Thirlby as Juno's teacher-obsessed best friend Leah and Rainn Wilson in a cameo as a smart-alecky convenience store clerk. Indie folk singer Kimya Dawson composed and performs the amusing songs that bridge the seasonal changes in the story. This film is a genuine winner strongly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>Juno is a film which tackles the issue of teenage pregnancy. Once teenager Juno discovers she is pregnant, she immediately tries to figure out what to do. Does she try to have an abortion, or does she keep it? Or does she give it up for adoption? The story revolves about her emotions in dealing with her pregnancy and bringing a life into the world. She tells her best friends, and seeks advice, and once she decides to give it away for adoption, meets the couple and tries to figure out if they will be the right parents for her child. While the film has heart at times, and good morals at times, over all the story's dialogue seems artificial and forced, and it seems to waver between wanting to be a drama and a comedy, and successfully being neither.<br /><br />Personally, the story wasn't very gripping or interesting, and part of this is due to lack of believability. Most films do not have to be realistic because they are solely based on entertaining, but if you are going to make a film about a serious issue like teen pregnancy or abortion then at least make it somewhat authentic.  Many scenes are understated, and you have to second guess whether this is how parents would really react. Consider the scene where Juno first tells her father and mother-in-law that she is pregnant. To use a word that Juno uses herself, her parents were way too "cavalier" about her news and her decision to have an abortion, not being riled up in the slightest and seemingly giving her the "OK" for it. Not only that, but she can even go to the abortion clinic alone.  Also, the scenes with Juno and her friend Paulie are way too lackadaisical, and the idea of Juno actually falling for someone who is her polar opposite and has no chemistry with is a bit ludicrous. (If so, why wasn't there any chemistry built between them in the film?)  I found Juno's character to be somewhat unbelievable as well; she has some elements of being a teenager with her smart aleck attitude and witticisms, but then she goes around being worldly and sophisticated also.<br /><br />The cute, hip dialogue gets little tiresome after awhile as well. Juno seems to be a film screaming "Look how indie and hip I am!"<br /><br />True, Juno's being up for last year's Best Picture really set the bar for expectations. Perhaps the public ate it up. (However, this award rarely is given to exceptional films anymore).  I watched Juno once, and once is enough. It's not horrible, but there is nothing that makes it exceptional either.</p></br><a href="../users/A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL.html">A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL</a><br/><p>While this was a little quirkier than most movies I watch, I did enjoy this a lot.  It was a great story line and acted really well by ALL the cast.  While Ellen Page was very good here, I thought some of the supporting actors were better still.  Jennifer Garner was great as Vanessa - the wife in the couple wanting to adopt a baby.  I thought she was as charming as ever.  Her husband, played by Jason Bateman was also great as a man with doubts about where he is in life.  Juno's friend (the father of the baby) Paulie Bleeker was one of the best actors here.  He was very supportive of Juno and whatever her decision was going to be.  It was also good that Juno had a very supportive father and step-mother, as is not always the case in movies with teenage pregnancy.<br />I must admit, the soundtrack was totally boring and awful, but the acting on all sides made up for that.  Everyone did a superb job and it truly is a feel good movie that really does make you feel good.  I'm glad I saw it, and while it may not be the kind of movie I'd watch 100 times, I'd certainly see it again over time and love it more each go.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>In the past month our local theater chain (we have but one in the Zenith City) has started listed "Critic's Choice" movies in their theater listing.  The only two movies selected for such an accolade at the present time were the Coen Brothers' "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YDDP7I">No Country for Old Men</a>" and "Juno."  I have already told you everything I know about the former, but of the latter I had heard nothing.  However, Roger Ebert's review of "Juno" appeared in the paper, and after scanning the first two paragraphs, where he calls it "just about the best movie of the year" and raves about Ellen Page's performance, I decided I wanted to see the movie.  The accompanying photograph showed Page running down the stairs in front of her house in between Allison Janney and J.K. Simmmons.  Recognizing the cast was enough to confirm my decision and I did not bother to read the caption for the photograph or the rest of the review.  Consequently, I sat in the theater today to watch "Juno" without any idea of what it was about and I hope that some of you are fortunate enough to have the same experience because with all the time you know what a movie is supposed to be about and you are bitterly disappointed, being pleasantly surprised and falling in love with a movie is pretty sweet.<br /><br />So I am not going to say anything about what the movie is about, although as a teaching of Classical Greek & Roman Mythology I feel compelled to point out that Juno is the wife of Jupiter in Roman mythology and not in Greek mythology, where she is called Hera (Juno is a much better name for the lead character in this movie).  I am going to say that first time writer Diablo Cody should win the Oscar for Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen on the basis of his dialogue in this movie.  At first I was thinking that the dialogue is like a condensed compendium of the sort of language we enjoyed for seven seasons of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQ68RI">Buffy The Vampire Slayer</a>," but that does not do Cody's dialogue justice.  The last time I heard dialogue that made me set up and take notice it was probably Quentin Tarentino's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000068DBC">Pulp Fiction</a>," but that was diction and timing rather than word choices.  Probably the closest comparison is between "Juno" and "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UJ48T0">A Clockwork Orange</a>," and that still does not do justice to the delightful verbiage that comes out of the mouths of these characters.<br /><br />The performance from the ensemble is stellar.  Those who have been debating whether Dakota Fanning or Evan Rachel Wood is the best actress under 21 are going to have to include Ellen Page in the debate.  I recognized her from "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HCO83Q">X-Men - The Last Stand</a>" and Michael Cera from "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WZEZGI">Superbad</a>," but clearly these roles go to the top of their resumes.  I know there is a bandwagon for Page for an Oscar nomination, but Janney and Simmons should be touted for their superb supporting roles as well.  "Juno" is the best thing that Jason Bateman has ever done and he is probably the biggest surprise here, although when Jennifer Garner's name came up in the opening credits I wondered what she was doing in this film, but seeing as how Bateman and Garner made "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y7WGOW">The Kingdom</a> together immediately before filming their roles in "Juno," I suspect that might be the connection.  I have to think that everybody who read this script, from director Jason Reitman ("<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0MKOC">Thank You for Smoking</a>") to the entire cast immediately signup for the joy of making this film.<br /><br />The one thing to be aware of is that you should stay for the end credits just to check out the songs that are in this movie, although once the Antsy Pants start playing "Vampire" you should want to stick around.  Be forewarned that "Juno" is one of those movies where you are going to want to get the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00104W8T6">soundtrack</a> on the way home from the theater (or, um, download it as soon as you get home).  The songs done for the movie are by Kimya Dawson, who is a perfect fit for Cody's screenplay, because she seems to be channeling Gilbert & Sullivan through postmodernist sensibilities.  But the great thing about the soundtrack is that all of the key songs that either play in the background or are actually played by (or sung by) the characters in the film are on the CD.  I should also mention that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1557048029">shooting script</a> is out there as well, if you want to read over the choice dialogue again while listening to the eclectic mix of songs on the soundtrack (while waiting for the movie to come out on DVD).</p></br><a href="../users/A18CMGIQZ1OAA2.html">A18CMGIQZ1OAA2</a><br/><p>Being adopted myself (given up by a young one) I got to thinking about my own juno out there and in a movie I was initially appose to seeing found a story I now find very special.<br />Its a story about a bright but goofy teenage girl and her very white bread(not in a racial way, I'm white lol), suburban crush with a craving for tic tacs Bleaker and an "experiment" gone terribly wrong.  After having sex for the first time in a chair juno finds herself pregnant and being an assertive little thing get in her mind she's gonna do right by the baby and not only put the baby up for adoption but find parents she sees fit.  She looks in the Penny Saver and this is the story that goes on from that.  Its not a sugar coated story of teen pregnancy but its not a depressing one either.  It simply approaches a sensitive topic with humor and along with a great soundtrack and a great cast including Jennifer Garner and Ellen Page.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>Juno (drama, comedy, romance)<br />Directed by Jason Reitman<br />Starring Ellen Page, Michael Cera, Jason Bateman and J.K.

It was a competitive year with No Country for Old Men and There Will Be Blood dividing six of the major categories between them, but Ellen Page was unlucky not to win in her category. Shot on a budget of $7.5 million, it made $143 million in the USA alone and a further $88 million worldwide.<br /><br />Director Jason Reitman was also responsible for Up in the Air in 2009, which, along with Juno, dealt with subjects in which I had very little interest. But Reitman's mix of drama and comedy works well in both movies and the witty dialogue drives both.<br /><br />Juno is funny throughout, but it's never dumb comedy and it never resorts to gross humor. The story works because we care about the characters and their one-liners fit both their personality and the situation. In short, it feels real. Many comedies assault the viewer with a stream of contrived jokes and it falls flat (for me at least).<br /><br />Juno MacGuff (Page) is 16 and newly-pregnant. We are shown a flashback showing how it happened and who the father is. It turns out to be one of her best friends, Paulie Bleeker (Cera). After telling him, she decides that an abortion is the best course of action, but she changes her mind following a visit to the clinic. She's a smart girl and feels capable of making her own decisions, eventually deciding that adoption may be the best thing for her and the baby.<br /><br />She finds potential parents in an ad and then has the task of telling her father (Simmons) and stepmother (Allison Janney) that she's pregnant. This is where the movie first defies our expectations. Instead of anger and shock, her parents are calm and accepting. They even joke about the situation when she reveals the father. It's so refreshing to see supportive parents rather than the usual stereotypes.<br /><br />Her father wants to go with her to meet the prospective foster parents, Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) and Mark (Bateman). Vanessa desperately wants a baby and is skeptical that Juno will honor the agreement, while Mark is more relaxed about everything. He bonds with Juno when she sees his guitar and they end up singing together.<br /><br />Juno keeps in touch with the couple and forms a friendship with Mark because of their common love of music and movies. I particularly like this sequence because I'm passionate about both subjects and know the power of sharing and talking about such things. It's the main reason that I write about movies. Mark introduces her to Sonic Youth (my favorite band) and Juno shares some of her classic rock and punk albums. It seems that the two might enter into a more serious relationship.<br /><br />Her stepmother teaches her about food supplements and defends Juno when she goes to the hospital and is insulted by the ultrasound technician. It's further evidence that she'll be supported in her choices all the way.<br /><br />Bleeker's face lights up every time he sees Juno. Cera plays the part well and doesn't go over the top. It's a quiet and understated performance, but he makes it clear that she's special to him. She suggests that he date a different girl, but is angry when he does. The two have a showdown and it again becomes clear that they really feel something for each other.<br /><br />There's a touching scene in the shopping mall where Juno encounters Vanessa and sees her playing with a little girl. We see Juno forming the opinion that Vanessa will make a good mother. The scene develops with a meeting between the two in which Vanessa talks to Juno's belly.<br /><br />Her arrangement with Vanessa and Mark is threatened by one occurrence and we wonder how everything will turn out. I won't reveal that here, but it's a good resolution.<br /><br />Another great scene involves a chat between father and daughter. It's a potentially life-changing talk played perfectly by Page and Simmons. It sets into motion events that shape Juno's immediate future. Simmons is so talented. If I were a writer/director, one of the first things I would do is create a starring role for Simmons. He's made his mark with supporting roles, but has so much more to offer.<br /><br />As for Page, what a remarkable talent. She carried such films as Whip It and Hard Candy, and had a major supporting role in Inception. At 24, she has most of her career ahead of her and I'm excited to see how she develops. She's already capable of showing so much emotion and her comic timing is perfect. It will be fun to see what happens over the next decade.<br /><br />One important component of the movie is the soundtrack. Kimya Dawson contributes nine of the songs in the film and they fit the mood and Juno's character perfectly. There's a well-placed Kinks song and bands such as Cat Power and Belle & Sebastian also fit the mood. The highlight is Sonic Youth covering the Carpenters' Superstar, and it's an important part of the plot.<br /><br />Juno isn't a film that will appeal to everyone. Some argue that the dialogue isn't realistic, but I found it so. Who is it aimed at? Teens? Women? Pregnant girls? Many will write it off as falling into one of those categories. That would be a shame because it has a lot more to offer. I'm a 48-year-old man and I found it utterly charming, refreshing, intelligent and genuinely funny.<br /><br />There's a chance it may upset some people because it turns a serious situation into an amusing comedy. Is it saying that it's acceptable to be pregnant at 16? How would you feel as a parent who faced a similar situation? How would you feel if you were a pregnant teen and didn't receive that kind of support and understanding from your parents? I would hope that it can be taken for what it is; a fictional situation. It's more about how the characters react to the situation than anything else.<br /><br />Video Quality 4/5<br />For such a low-budget movie, the look is surprisingly good. The transfer is clean and free from damage, colors are well-represented and detail is good in the vast majority of scenes. I can't quite justify a 4.5, but it's certainly worth a 4. Don't expect a visual feast and you should be pretty happy with the overall look.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4/5<br />Juno is a dialogue-heavy movie that's quiet for the majority of its running time, but the sound still plays an important part. The songs are presented well and when sound is called for, such as in amplified effects in the clinic waiting room, it comes across convincingly.<br /><br />Special Features 5/5<br /><br />It's rare that I watch a movie and immediately tackle all of the special features, and even rarer to watch them again on subsequent viewings. Juno is an exception. I like this world and the quality of the extras makes it worth seeing them more than once, even though they are all in standard definition.<br /><br />Commentary with Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody<br /><br />Deleted Scenes (20:23) - It would be great to see an extended version of the film at some point and most or all of these scenes would fit well. My favorites include Juno singing a song about Paulie in a bar and her real thoughts about Sonic Youth.<br /><br />Gag Reel (5:11)<br /><br />Gag Take (1:57)<br /><br />Crew Music Video (3:12) - A song featuring members of the cast.<br /><br />Screen Tests (22:35) - See how Page, Cera, Thirlby and Simmons earned their roles.<br /><br />Way Beyond "Our" Maturity Level: Juno-Leah-Bleeker (8:59)<br /><br />Diablo Cody is Totally Boss (8:35) - Showing how Cody went from blogger to writing the screenplay.<br /><br />Jason Reitman for Shizz (8:08) - Showing how Reitman came to direct the movie.<br /><br />Honest to Blog!: Creating Juno (13:01) - Reitman, Cody and some of the cast talking about how the movie came to be made.<br /><br />Fox Movie Channel presents world premiere...Juno (5:26)<br /><br />Fox Movie Channel presents Casting Session: Juno (7:51)<br /><br />Watching Juno is like spending time with an old friend. It's warm and familiar and makes me grin throughout. I would like to see Juno at 26 to find out how her experiences and decisions shaped her life. If you like quirky, intelligent humor and good acting, Juno will probably work for you too.<br /><br />Overall score 5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>I thought Juno was a sweet film. The movie tells the story of Juno (played exquisitely by Ellen Page), a 16-year-old girl who gets pregnant. At first, Juno tries to arrange a "hasty abortion," but she finds that she can't go through with it. Then, deciding to give the baby up for adoption, she looks through a local Penny Saver and finds the perfect couple in search of a baby - Vanessa (Jennifer Garner in a pitch-perfect, heartbreaking turn) and Mark (Jason Bateman, dead-on as always).<br /><br />Juno meets with the couple and makes all the necessary plans to have them adopt the baby. She feels secure in the knowledge that these two people will give her baby the perfect life.<br /><br />But when Juno begins to notice the cracks in her dream of perfection, she begins doubting everything - love, the ability of a couple of stay together, her choice to give her baby up, and her own feelings for Bleeker (Micheal Cera), the baby's father.<br /><br />I honestly think there are NO bad performances in this movie. Even the small parts are rendered with reality and depth of thought. J.K. Simmons is wonderful as Juno's dad, and ditto for Alison Janney as her stepmom. It's really an ensemble piece, with the four principles - Page, Garner, Bateman, and Cera - doing most of the heavy lifting. Page shines, delivering the types of lines you've never heard ANYONE really say with amazing credibility.<br /><br />And, a note - in most movies, scenes that are the least bit tense are far overblown for "dramatic" value. Chracters cry, scream, storm off, do a bunch of stupid stuff. And I don't doubt that there are some people who handle stressful situations that way. But there are plenty of us who try to maintain some shred of self-control and attempt to make the best of the hand we are dealt. This movie is about people like that.<br /><br />When Juno tells her parents she's pregnant, there's no histrionic fall-out. Sure, they are disappointed. Sure, they let her know that. She's disappointed in herself. But she's also made a decision, and she has a responsible plan to deal with the result of her irresponsibility. It's characters like this that make you want to keep going to see movies. I applaud Diablo Cody (the screenwriter) for reminding us that everyone is not a weak, sniveling idiot.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>When 16-year old tomboy and wise-cracker Juno (Ellen Page) discovers she's pregnant, she decides to look for a couple to adopt her baby.  She finds yuppies Vanessa and Mark (Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman) and thinks they would be super cool parents.<br /><br />I was prepared to dislike this movie because I don't think teen pregnancy is comical, but I was won over by Ellen Page's quirky charm.  She's smart, independent, strong and very likeable, a true gem of an actress.  Michael Cera plays her clueless boyfriend; he's believably bewildered by the pregnancy and, though more interested in the track team than the baby, is quite appealing, too.<br /><br />Juno becomes a strong heroine in a tough situation.  The movie is funny and the characters are real and it has the off-beat feeling that indie movies often have.  Recommended if you can overlook the basic moral issue and enjoy the story.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>"Juno" is a tarted-up Afterschool Special for the 21st century.  Surprisingly, it works.  It's not groundbreaking, or worth all the hype, but it's entertaining, and that's all that really matters.  And at 90 minutes, it avoids the cardinal sin of outlasting its welcome.<br /><br />I never thought Jennifer Garner was a good actress, but she is excellent in this film.  I don't know if it was the direction or the script, but she walks the knife edge between being sympathetic and domineering perfectly.  And Jason Bateman plays a different character than he usually does.  Sadly, for fans of Arrested Development, he doesn't have a single scene with Michael Cera.  Cera isn't in this movie very much, but he is great whenever he's in a scene.  Who would have thought he would turn out to be the big breakout movie star of Arrested Development?<br /><br />On the downside, the dialogue is often a bit too cutesy and precious for its own good, especially toward the beginning of the movie.  And, like all movies with teenagers, the characters don't act like real teenagers.  Nonetheless, my wife (who works at a high school) says that "Juno" gets closer than a lot of movies to what teenagers are actually like.<br /><br />I'd recommend "Juno" as a rental.  It's worth seeing, but you're unlikely to want to add this to your permanent collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D.html">A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D</a><br/><p>First off, the acting in this movie was great, I was very impressed with the characters and how realistic they personailities were.  However, the life changing events deplicted in the movie were just a bit too casual in reactions.  Pregnancy and growing up with that reality and the society's response was not as realistic as the movie deplicted.  I actually had to break this show up into two parts because it was just difficult to watch.  I don't plan to add this to my library.  I do look forward to watching Ellen Page continue her acting career.</p></br></body></html>

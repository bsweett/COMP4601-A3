The story is about a supervillain attempting to steal all the gold from Fort Knox, or so we think.  007 must try and prevent the gold heist as he battles henchmen, lasers, and survives a good car chase.  The setting of Bluegrass, Kentucky may not seem very glamorous, but somehow it succeeds in this story.  This is pure Bond throughout with several gorgeous leading ladies and plenty of the usual wittisisms.  As Goldfinger puts it," Choose your next wittisism carefully, Mr. Bond. It may be your last." Everything is here in this classic.  Great villain, exciting action, awesome theme song, beautiful Bond girl, and the famous Aston Martin.<p> What else can I say about Sean Connery that hasn't been said already?  He is and always will be the perfect James Bond.  Gert Frobe stars as Auric Goldfinger, the supervillain bent on owning all the world's gold.  Honor Blackman plays Pussy Galore, the Bond girl whose allegiance we aren't sure of.  Harold Sakata steals the show as Oddjob with his devilish little smile and razor sharp derby hat.  All the parts in this movie are played to perfection and could not be any better.  The Special Edition DVD is well worth the price with several interesting documentaries, plenty of trailers and TV spots, widescreen presentation included and the film looks better than ever.  Any Bond fan must have this in their collection.  Go out and buy this fabulous James Bond classic!</p></br><a href="../users/A33XHXRTRZOQ12.html">A33XHXRTRZOQ12</a><br/><p>This is the movie that pretty much made Bond as a film institution. The car, the music, the cinematography, (for the day,) the casting...absolutley EVERYTHING was perfect for this third film installment of the Bond series, and it paid off. For a time, "Goldfinger" was THE highest grossing film in the world before "The Sound Of Music" came out. And at only $1.50 a head back in those days, $43,000,000 was no mean feat!<br /><br />What made "Goldfinger" so fascinating was that, as far-fetched as the idea was, the possible attempt by a foreign power to take over Fort Knox was STILL all-too-conceivable! Not much was changed from the book, but it WAS substantial: The inimitable Miss Galore only had 2% of the book, she had 66% of the movie. Tilly Masterson, who had 66% of the book, had only 1% of the movie. Felix Leiter was only in the last 2% of the book, but was all through the movie, and, in the movie, introduced Bond to Auric Goldfinger. In the book, the guy Goldfinger played gin with met Bond at an airport in the Caribbean as they were both leaving the island got Bond interested in Herr Goldfinger's suspected card cheating initially.<br /><br />In the book, Pussy Galore was actually one of the people brought in by Bond and Tilly FOR Goldfinger to help engineer Operation Grand Slam.  In the movie, she worked for Goldfinger as a pilot and flight trainer...in the book, she headed a troupe of aerialists. (In the book, Bond and Tilly were granted their lives after being captured on the condition that they actually work for his organization AS recruiters and planners!) However, with all these differences, (and there are more!) the "feel" of the book is pretty much kept intact.<br /><br />Another thing, if you are too young to remember: This film, probably more than any other in movie history, influenced pop culture unlike anything you've ever seen! Pop literature, movies, television, manufacturing and magazine publishing all went bananas for the whole Bond aesthetic and lifestyle. TV was awash in Bond imitators on all three networks: shows like "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.", "The Wild, Wild West", "T.H.E Cat", "The Secret Life of Henry Pfyffe", "The Avengers", "The Saint", "Danger Man" ("Secret  Agent",)"Honey West", "Get Smart", "Mission: Impossible", "Mannix", "Amos Burke, Secret Agent" and "Blue Light" started being programmed in as if a sluice gate opened after 1964, the year of Goldfinger's release.<br /><br />Fan magazines popped up for "U.N.C.L.E.", Bond, The Avengers and "Secret Agent" and commerce, too, dove in, with "007" toiletries for men, "Silva Thins" cigarettes, "James Bread from Bond", "The Man From G.L.A.D." and Mattel's "OM" line of toys. Nothing...repeat, NOTHING, not even Star Wars or Star Trek merchandising, ever equalled this madness!<br /><br />Many Bond competitors popped up in pulp novels as well, characters like Matt Helm, Modesty Blaise, George Smiley, Harry Palmer and others too numerous to mention. Movie rivals were "Arabesque", Blaise, Our Man Flint, Helm, George Smiley and Alec Leames, Harry Palmer and others, including a substandard comedy duo, Allen and Rossi, doing a piece of swill parody called "The Last of the Secret Agents". Even the gruesome, lowest common denominator sitcom, "The Beverly Hillbillies", parodied Bond. It was incredible!<br /><br />BTW, did you know that Auric Goldfinger was Russian and was actually working for SMERSH? Well, now you know! All in all, a movie with few faults in a period when good movie mystery/adventures were actually just getting revived as a genre, ("Charade", "Arabesque", "Our Man Flint".) This baby could easily be called the King of Them All!</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICHEO78NFE4Y.html">A3ICHEO78NFE4Y</a><br/><p>Out of all the 007 movies made and all the actors who have played Agent 007, we only end up with ONE real James Bond and that is Sean Connery.With that said to me there is only ONE James Bond movie that has always had my vote and that is "Gold Finger."  It's the most romantic of all James Bond films, the most well acted of all James Bond films and has the BEST music score of all James Bond films.This movie does everything right. Each scene is more trilling then the next, the bitter/sweet romance between Pussy Galore and Bond is the most sexy of all the 007 movies and Sean Connery proves that HE is the best James Bond of them all.  No other James Bond movie has had the impact that this one great story does and out of all his movies is the most believable.  This is for me "the classic" 007 movie next to "From Russia with Love" and "Doctor No."  After "Gold Finger" they were entertaining but started to get somewhat unbelievable and lost my interest really fast.It was just to bad that this film wasn't originally filmed in Magnetic Stereo Sound so that the DVD would be in 5.1.  Could you imagine hearing that music being played on a THX sound system in full stereo sound.  Never-the-less i still give this movie my thumbs-up and my highest and only James Bond review.Roger Moore who i respect and love as an actor especially in the role of Michael Stewart in "The Miracle", my very first review and my all time BEST PICTURE will never have the "class" that Sean Connery has in just this one film. I won't even comment about all the other James Bonds that followed.Buy this film,,,,it's WONDERFUL!</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>In the third Bond outing, the ante (and the budget) was upped to produce one of the best in the franchise. With incredible locations, great casting, particuarly with Gert Frobe as the title character and Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman).Guy Hamilton's direction of Bond no.3 is a touch lighter than Terrance Young's on Dr No (1962) and From Russia with Love (1963) and the story may be a bit on the fantastical side with an atttack on Fort Knox, however this is minor carping, as the film is near flawless, and Connery, as always, as the main attraction of the early Bond films is as charming and debionaire as ever, letting the sucsess of Goldfinger prompt the filmmakers to move forward with more of Flemming's novels...</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>GOLDFINGER contains a well-balanced level of depth and action leaving one emotionally charged, thrilled and entertained. This is Sean Connery's finest James Bond film and perhaps the definitive James Bond film of the entire series giving the outstanding and underrated ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE serious competition in that department after much contemplation.<br /><br />The golden girl, Oddjob's bowler hat, Goldfinger's lethal laser, the Astin Martin DB5 with modifications introduced by Q, and Shirley Bassey's legendary rendition of the theme song belted out over the titles immediately became an integral part of the James Bond lore and remained in the psyche of the public.<br /><br />Director Guy Hamilton, screen writers Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn and editor Peter Hunt were able to produce a solid, well balanced, entertaining film that does not rely totally on the spectacle and whimsy that would weaken the subsequent entries in the series.<br /><br />Production designer Ken Adam and art director Peter Murton gave the production a stunning and lavish distinction. The Fort Knox set and Goldfinger's playroom at his stud ranch was a testament to imagination and achievement. John Barry finally honed his distinctive style to perfection with this memorable score and set a benchmark of distinct and stylistic scoring for the James Bond series.<br /><br />Sean Connery's performance as James Bond is a well honed mix of determination, humor and dedication to that end of getting the job done at all costs. He brings a wry humor to the role in this film, demonstrates compassion for the opposite sex (despite what he detractors may say) and eliminates all those who present evil and malevolence to our way of life with cold detachment. He is that blunt instrument of his government but Connery does it with such aplomb.<br /><br />Sean Connery may have given his definitive performance as James Bond in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. In GOLDFINGER Sean Connery added more cynicism and humor to the role giving the character, this film, and the entire series a new dimension. That humor somehow takes a bit of the realistic edge off of the character. With 2006's CASINO ROYALE, a level of realism was added to the series that had never been seen up to then. And so we reflect back on what Sean Connery had established. Strictly an observation and a retrospective contemplation on my part.<br /><br />Celebrating James Bond's 50th Anniversary on the screen!</p></br><a href="../users/A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2.html">A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2</a><br/><p>Governments are not the only targets that interest SPECTRE.<br /><br />Auric Goldfinger (Bert Frobe) sets-up the national crime syndicate for a con, inviting them to participate in the unbelievable bank robbery of Fort Knox; a bank that is guarded by 40,000 soldiers and contains the entire gold reserve of the United States.<br /><br />After Goldfinger has collected one million dollars from each syndicate boss for the right to hear the plan, the bosses believe the robbery idea to be stupid and want the money returned. Goldfinger destroys them all, one in a particularly colorful way.<br /><br />Meanwhile in England, MI6 has been watching Goldfinger, believing that he is responsible for smuggling an unprecedented amount of gold out of country. James Bond is assigned to the task and watches from a distance, until the sister of a lady Goldfinger is responsible for killing tries to even the score. As she begins to get herself into serious trouble, James Bond intervenes but is captured by Goldfinger.<br /><br />Only then, does 007 learn that Goldfinger's plan is to detonate a nuclear devise in Fort Know. This will effectively take the Fort Knox gold off the market; crippling western economies, and make Goldfinger wealthy by increasing the overall market price ten fold.<br /><br />This is by far the best James Bond movie. After "Dr. No" and "From Russia With Love", the James Bond character has been honed to the expectations of a growing audiences. Budgeting looks bigger, everything is broader, more elaborate. Best of all is that the James Bond character remains a very realistic portrayal of a secret service agent.<br /><br />A great movie and good entertainment for the whole family.</p></br><a href="../users/A16GAIJJE39T1S.html">A16GAIJJE39T1S</a><br/><p>This movie came out when I was 12 years old and I didn't get to see it until several years later.  But I still knew all about that cool Aston Martin and built a plastic model of it complete with a spring-loaded ejection seat that actually worked.  There was a rumor at the time that George Mahoney, who alternated between Democratic and third party Maryland gubernatorial candidacies, promised to equip the state police with vehicles of this sort if he were elected Governor.  This was in keeping with Mahoney's campaign slogan "Your home is your castle--protect it."  He would certainly have won the election if 6-18 year old boys had been able to vote!<br /><br />The movie has a simple but engaging plot that a twelve year old boy can appreciate--get the Red Chinese (as we called them then) to set off an atomic bomb at Fort Knox so that Goldfinger's own gold stockpile would increase in value--a sort of straightforward lesson in the law of supply and demand in economics!<br /><br />I was surprised many years later at the comment that my own 12 or 13 year old son made when he watched this movie with me on TV.  "He (James Bond) is not very interested in his job--or very good at it!"  This insightful observation comes from that fact that Bond is always being found out and captured by the bad guys (despite his fully-loaded Aston Martin and other fancy equipment)--and seems way more interested in bedding the various Bond girls than in the spy business!  This movie is still fun for me to watch, though--and to hear the irreverent observations of my children concerning it!</p></br><a href="../users/A25UZ7MA72SMKM.html">A25UZ7MA72SMKM</a><br/><p>The third installment of Bond was again quite close to the book, and more of a pure spy story than the action flicks the series later became. Made in the 'good old days', when they could film a Bond movie each year and have a hit every time! It is also the container for the most provocatively named of all 'Bond girls', Pussy Galore. Fleming dreamed up a few of these not so sly double entendres, but this one was REALLY out there. LOL This movie was the first Bond film to change locales around the world several times, moving from Miami to England to Europe and then to Kentucky.<br /><br />The manner of death of some of the villains is a bit altered from the book, but for a film adaptation of a novel Goldfinger stays very true to the original story.<br /><br />Sadly, the battle between Goldfinger's forces and the troops stationed at Fort Knox presage a sad development in Bond climaxes as the series progressed.<br /><br />Very enjoyable, Bond is still more of a spy than a commando, sit back and appreciate it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MX6D3JK6IKDW.html">A1MX6D3JK6IKDW</a><br/><p>Not the complete success of its predecessor,Dr. No,but aided by terrific photography and one of the best movie theme songs of all time, this film can certainly hold its head up in polite society. The plot is simple enough,to the point of being totally absurd. Mr.Goldfinger would like to increase his world gold deposits' values 1000% by rendering Ft. Knox"s supply useless for 58 years (using a small atomic device). Also, the script puts our hero James Bond (Connery) in a series of situations, including one on a table with a laser headed straight for his scrotum, in which he could easily be killed. Indeed, in a movie that features agent 007, we find a careless agent, one whom Matt Damon as Jason Bourne would eliminate today with a mere hiccup. Bourne is almost always the master of his fate,Bond relies too much on luck, fate, and the adage that good will triumph over evil. Have you read a newspaper lately? What was great entertainment in 1964, is still a good view today.But, as in golf, one is watching Arnold Palmer here, not Tiger Woods.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>GOLDFINGER contains a well-balanced level of depth and action leaving one emotionally charged.

The casting is impeccable, and Sean Connery is at his best in this one.  Further, this film follows the book quite closely, and where it departs from it, it is better than the book, which is unusual for a James Bond flick.<br /><br />This film has class.  The scene where Bond comments on the cognac in the meeting with M and the gold expert, and M is plainly irritated by Bond's offhand expertise as to fine liquor, is typical of the film, and hilarious. (Especially so, as M has just finished chewing out 007 for his womanizing on a prior assignment.) In this film Bond is not a comic-book cutout character, or a superman.  He is a fallible human being with a weakness for gorgeous women which, admittedly, he seems to luck into more than is probably humanly possible, but then again why not?<br /><br />"Goldfinger" avoids the pitfalls of some of the later James Bond flicks, and never lapses into slapstick.  The ending is a trifle over the top, (no spoiler here) but only moderately so.  I trust that a re-release of this superb film in DVD is imminent.</p></br><a href="../users/A20JYIHL1W1U54.html">A20JYIHL1W1U54</a><br/><p>GOLDFINGER is a very good movie. Perhaps it is the best James Bond film of he entire series. This one film contains many definitive aspects of all the James Bond films in the series. GOLDFINGER is very different from its two predecessors. The level of sophistication is much higher. Visually it is more stunning and is lavishly produced establishing a high standard for many of the cinematic elements associated with a James Bond film. Sean Connery gives his most sophisticated and distinguished performance as James Bond in GOLDFINGER. His friendly and easygoing approach in this film combined with his look of determination and confidence, wit, charm and a physical dexterity all add to his arsenal for self-preservation in order to see the job of eliminating the opposition to fruition. Even the main villain Goldfinger, who is more menacing and cunningly diabolical than his predecessors, is given greater depth by screenwriters Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn. Gert Frobe's performance and visual presence as Goldfinger is one of the highlights of this film and the series. He is a constant menace to Bond as they play a cat and mouse game throughout the film. The intriguing golf game is a highlight of their confrontation. Once again another distinctive element to the Bond formula is introduced during the golf game in the form of Oddjob, the main villain's henchman who kills his victims with a steal edged bowler hat. Returning to Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn, it can be seen that the script of GOLDFINGER is perhaps the best structured and balanced giving the plot elements, action sequences and the familiar Bond gadgets integrated treatment producing a solid story. Their script is also rich with character development meticulously incorporated into the story, which is never intrusive to the film's flow but is part of the cohesiveness of all the visuals skillfully directed by Guy Hamilton and expertly edited together by Peter Hunt. Of those visuals it is Production Designer Ken Adam's distinctive set designs that also help define the film's "Bond look" where he creates a unique look of functionally modern almost futuristic sets that dominate the screen with his iconic style. Cinematographer Ted Moore did some of his best work on this film utilizing photographic techniques to produce a dynamic and lavish look to this film. John Barry composed (along with lyricists Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley) the main title to GOLDFINGER sung by Shirley Bassey, which is probably the most recognizable song from the series and immediately brings to mind images of James Bond to this day. This melody used and often referred to throughout the score integrates the James Bond Theme along with John Barry's own distinctive musical motifs and style once again lending credence that this is the definitive Bond film when combined with all the other superlative elements presented in GOLDFINGER. The "Bond Girls" and their specific role in the Bond formula are best represented yet uniquely presented in GOLDFINGER seeing that the formula in this film is tweaked a bit. Usually the formula dictates that Bond has one leading female partner who accompanies him on and off during his exploits. There is also the sacrificial lamb that becomes sexually involved with Bond but along the way pays the ultimate sacrifice, which only intensifies Bond's resolve to vanquish the villain. Also, there may be a female villain who Bond also becomes sexually involved in and her fate varies from film to film. GOLDFINGER as a film stands on its own. It is good filmmaking. As a James Bond film it could easily be considered the best of the series.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>GOLDFINGER contains a well-balanced level of depth and action leaving one emotionally charged, thrilled and entertained.

It has all the elements of a great Bond movie and has some of the best moments of this franchise that has now spanned four decades.<p>The plot to Goldfinger is simple enough. Auric Goldfinger has one of the largest collections of gold in the world. He has a plan to contaminate the gold the in Ft. Knox making his own gold more valuable and thus hurting the USA because at the time we still backed all our cash with gold. MI6 James Bond is on the case and with help from a bunch of notable characters it's up to him to stop Goldfingers evil plan.This might not be the best description of the plot ever but it's short sweet and accurate.<p>Sean Connery gives his best performnce as 007 in this movie. He carries a swagger in Goldfinger that you just absolutely love. No other guy to play Bond really has achieved that. He really turned himself into a house hold name with this performance and he's just awesome. His performance alone is worth the movie.<p>Auric Goldfinger is an awesome bad guy. Most Bond movies are as good as the bad guys in them and Goldfinger is one of the best ever. Gert Frobe puts a face to the Bond bad guys. Up to this point in the Bond franchise the bad guys hadn't been all that great. Robert Shaw was alright in From Russia with Love but he was stiff and the character was dull. The same thing can be said about Joseph Wiseman who played Dr. No. Gert just took this role and ran with it. He's easily the best bad guy ever in a Bond film. Like Connery you can buy this movie for Gert Frobe's performance as Goldfinger. It's well worth the price.<p>This was the first Bond movie to put a Bond car on the map. The Aston Martin Db5 is excellent in this movie. The car fight is great and is one of the most memorable scenes in the movie.<p>Goldfinger is the best Bond movie ever. It has the best Bond performance and the best bad guy in any of the films. It's the reason the Bond franchise is where it's at today and is a must for all Bond fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A33XHXRTRZOQ12.html">A33XHXRTRZOQ12</a><br/><p>Why DVDs have taken over the video market...! I mean, tapes have the usual bugaboos, yes, (wrinkles, the occasional dropouts, the VERY rare occurence of breakage,) but the picture is usually beautifully saturated, full and well defined. EVERY DVD I have, with the exception of one of "Charade", has this annoying washout to the colors with exaggerated highlights and paler fleshtones. I usually have to darken my TV's picture to an unnatural level to get anywhere NEAR the same fidelity of tone I get with a VHS tape.<p>That settled, I'd like to say that the extras that come with this DVD, (about the only thing the format seems to HAVE over VHS except for the wrinkle-free aspect, and even THEN not on all DVDs!) are nice, with extensive behind-the-scenes info on the production of the film and trivia about Gert Frobe's reading of the title role and that great car. <p>However, once the American public realizes what a crappy picture theyr'e getting with DVDs, I predict there will be rush back to tape that'll scare people! Heck, the format's going dirt cheap these days, anyway, with sound that I think is BETTER, (along with the picture,) than DVD!!</p></br><a href="../users/AOVJYIUATQKR5.html">AOVJYIUATQKR5</a><br/><p>rank 6th of 23.  Another monster movie.  Hughly popular, a major phenomena in its debut it had numerous highly discussed scenes such as, the girl with the golden paint, the golf match, the fort knox plot and a lady named "Pussy Galore".  It was probably this movie that assured that the next 17 Bond movies would be made at all.<p>Great screenplay, good action even today and of course, Sean Connery!</p></br><a href="../users/A3JZ5L52FM318H.html">A3JZ5L52FM318H</a><br/><p>The film:<br /><br />"Dr. No" and "From Russia With Love" are classics in their own rights, but "Goldfinger" really has it all. A good villain, Bond-babes galore, lush locales, and Sean Connery at his best. And it's all done at a brisk, entertaining pace which never feels bloated in the way "Thunderball" did.<br /><br />The classic moments in this film are too numerous to mention. The babooshka-granny with the machine gun, death by gold paint, the tricked out Aston Martin, lasers to the groin, Odd Job and his odd haberdasheries... This film has been referenced and spoofed so many times by so many lesser movies and shows that you'll likely not be surprised even if it is your first time watching.<br /><br />It's all pulled off with such panache and style, it doesn't feel cliched at all (plus, it pays to remember that it was all fresh and new when it premiered.) Goldfinger has the perfect mix of humor, violence, style, and cool. The mix went out of whack with most Bond films after it, and the franchise (arguably) probably hasn't returned to a good balance until "Casino Royale."<br /><br />Anyway, it's pretty nearly a perfect Bond movie. Relentlessly entertaining, fun, exciting, and just darn good.<br /><br />**************<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />This transfer really shines at times, with impressive detail on facial close-ups, mountain vistas, and clothing. There are some soft spots, but this is quite forgivable in a 45 year old film. Overall, the detail is very impressive, and tops that of the previous two films on Blu-Ray. I was surprised by how many little things I noticed when I just sat back and let it all soak in - wood grains, dandelions in a field, pebbles on the ground. Black levels are rock solid, color is very naturalistic and stable. Overall it's just a tremendous job by the MGM studio and Lowry Digital to not overdo it and let the natural film elements stand on their own merits. So many times studios feel the need to over-enhance their older films to have them "compete" with newer releases, which usually just ends up introducing new video noise, or ends up washing out actual detail in the image ("Dark City" and its waxen faces springs to mind.) "Goldfinger," by not going overboard, sets the bar very high for a catalog film restoration.<br /><br />Special features also shine - several HD documentaries, a commentary with the cast and crew (including Connery), and some original period promotional pieces round out a really top-notch package of extras.<br /><br />*********<br /><br />For any Bond aficionado with a good HD setup, this is a no-brainer. This is pretty much the best Bond film of its era (although I am quite partial to "From Russia With Love," as well). The disc is a definite upgrade over a DVD. Action film fans and fans of 60's era thrillers will get a kick out of this, too.<br /><br />I recommend buying "Dr. No," "From Russia," and "Goldfinger" on Blu-Ray. These three films will give you pure 60's Bond without any of the silliness of the later stuff. You can stop there, or maybe pick up the two latest flicks, too, as they are tremendous Blu-Ray presentations also.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>Though "Dr. No" and "From Russia With Love" got the ball rolling, it was "Goldfinger" (1964) that started the 007 phenomenon - establishing a cinematic formula that has endured from Sean Connery to Pierce Brosnan. In a recent interview, Connery said his portrayal of James Bond may have set too high a standard for the other actors to match. The same can be said for the early 007 films. With the exception of "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" (1969), it's hard to top the excitement and inventiveness of "Goldfinger." The villains, gadgets and locales are top notch, with Connery in splendid form. Admittedly, the Fort Knox climax is a bit hokey in spots and it's obvious that American gangsters are played by British actors. Despite these dated elements, "Goldfinger" is a definite highpoint in the 007 series.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>GOLDFINGER has become recognized as a cultural phenomena and the Jams Bond craze started taking off after the release of this film. GOLDFINGER contains a well-balanced level of depth and action leaving one emotionally charged. This is perhaps Sean Connery's finest James Bond film. The golden girl, Oddjob's bowler hat, Goldfinger's lethal laser, the Astin Martin DB5 with modifications introduced by Q, and Shirley Bassey's legendary rendition of the theme song belted out over the titles immediately became an integral part of the James Bond lore and remained in the psyche of the public.<br /><br />Director Guy Hamilton, screen writers Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn and editor Peter Hunt were able to produce a solid, well balanced, entertaining film based on Ian Fleming's novel that does not rely totally on the spectacle and whimsy that would weaken the subsequent entries in the series. Production designer Ken Adam and art director Peter Murton gave the production a stunning and lavish distinction. The Fort Knox set and Goldfinger's playroom at his stud ranch was a testament to imagination and achievement. John Barry's score is unique in some respects as he continued to finally hone his distinctive style to perfection with this memorable score.<br /><br />This edition contains a digitally remastered print restored frame by frame and the sound has been remastered in a 5.1 DTS mix. Most impressive is that there is true Front Left and Right stereo separation. I think the technicians had a lot to work with. If you examine the last Laserdisc release of GOLDFINGER it contained an isolated music and sound effects track, so some valuable audio separation existed to work with. The results are impressive on this front and the basic sound of the audio is much more defined and sounds clean and crisp to the ear.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HX00DL0SZM1G.html">A1HX00DL0SZM1G</a><br/><p>The initial filmic foray into James Bonds world, the 1962 DR. NO  introduced a number of key elements in what would become known as the "James Bond formula." We have the suave and sophisticated British agent defeating a larger than life villain among an exotic land populated by beautiful, exotic women, some good and some bad, and signature sets designed by the legendary designer Ken Adam. Then a year later came FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, the second entry which further added the elements of a shocking pre-credits sequence, a gadget laden briefcase and a seemingly indestructible henchman in the shape of Robert Shaw's Red Grant. Yet, it is 1964s GOLDFINGER which is almost universally acknowledged as setting the blueprint for all future movies not only because it combined all the previous element, but that it put them all together in one bigger and more fantastic tapestry of overblown action and spectacle. It's not surprising that many Bond fans list this extravaganza as one of the most consistently entertaining of the series.<br />Based on the 1959 book by Ian Fleming, the main attraction in this movie is the villain, who utters some of the most memorable lines in film history. Who can forget the image of Bond strapped down to a table about to be dissected by a laser. "Do you expect me to talk?," asks 007 nervously eyeing the danger. "No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die," replies Goldfinger before going on about his business.<br />We catch our first sight of Goldfinger on Miami Beach immediately after a stand-alone precredits sequence and a main title sequence that features Shirley Bassey belting out the famous title track.<br />In a quite ingenious manner Goldfinger is cheating at cards. It's not long before Bond has figured out the manner by which he is doing it, but also met a very beautiful blonde named Jill Masterson (played by the impossibly beautiful Shirley Eaton) and turned the tables on Goldfinger - all in a matter of a couple of minutes (this 007 guy doesn't stick around I tell you). However, later that night, as Bond recovers from being knocked out cold we are presented with one of the iconic images of 1960s pop culture with a dead Jill, nude on a bed and covered entirely in gold paint. This image proved so enticing that it became a trademark image associated with the film and the series for years to, come.<br />Another trademark image from the movie is a giant Korean (the actor was actually Hawaiian) who kills people with a steel-rimmed bowler hat. Oddjob, who would set the standard by which all future henchmen would be measured) makes his first on-screen appearance in a game of golf (although he is clearly the one who knocked Bond out earlier). In what is one of my favorite sequences in the 40-plus years of the Bond franchise Goldfinger is at it again - cheating. This time when a ball is lost Oddjob simply drops another ball in a more convenient location. However yet again Bond manages to turn the tables on him. It's the understated game of cat and mouse set on the lush green golf course that really set the magic for me in this scene.<br />The book is set into three sections and these are mirrored here in this movie. The first section of the book is titled "Happenstance" in that one meeting can be a matter of timing and focuses mainly on the meeting between 007 and Goldfinger in Miami. The second section is titles "Coincidence" to explain a second meeting and this focuses on the golf game between the two. The third section is titled "Enemy Action" in explaining Goldfingers take on 007s third encounter with 007 and details the confrontation between the two in Switzerland that form the middle-part of the movie.<br />Another seminal image of the movie is the gadget laden Aston Martin DB5 complete with ejector seat. Pushing the envelope and taking its cue from the briefcase in the previous movie here we have a car that includes among its special features an oil slick, homing system, guns behind the lights and revolving number plates.<br />Truly this is the seminal entry in the franchise and we are treated here to a nice collection of special features the most impressive of which is a scene specific commentary from director Guy Hamilton.<br />On a sidenote - work is currently underway by Lowry Digital to restore this movie, if audio and video is of primary importance to you then you might want to wait until that is released in 2006.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GA2SO3YK6CXI.html">A2GA2SO3YK6CXI</a><br/><p>Goldfinger<br /><br />The third movie featuring James Bond, Agent 007 of her Majesty's Secret Intelligence Service continues to marvel audiences the world over. James Bond is a fictional character created by writer Ian Fleming in 1953 while he vacationed in his Jamaican property by the name of Golden-eye.<br /><br />The James Bond movies capture the action and romance found in the books by the author and surfaced a world of espionage, gadgets, secret weapons, beautiful women and amazing cars. The success of Sean Connery created an image so powerful that still to today, it is thought as that of the best Bond character.<br /><br />By the time the third movie "Goldfinger" was released most people were already addicted to the smart sayings of Bond... "My name if Bond, James Bond;" "Shaken, not stirred" and so many others. Goldfinger incorporated unforgettable bits: "Do you want me to talk? [Goldfinger] No, I just want you to die!"<br /><br />With Goldfinger, the plot is to take over the ultimate Gold bank, Fort Knox and while the movie is not filmed at that location, a replica is created and we almost believe we are visiting it. Without a doubt, this is one of the best Bond movies.<br /><br />Living in South Florida, it was fun to see the film open up in Miami Beach as Goldfinger, played by Gert Frobe, a gold tycoon plays cards with a man while a woman watches through binoculars from his hotel room and tells him what to play.<br /><br />Bond discovers what he is doing and tells Goldfinger, who does not like to lose, that he better allow the man to recover what he has lost or he will get the authorities involved. Jill Masterson, played by Shirley Eaton, has the role of the assistant who gets killed by skin asphyxiation [body is covered with gold paint] because she helps and allows herself to be seduced by Bond.<br /><br />Soon, Bond is told that he needs to discover how the gold is transported by Goldfinger but Oddjob, an overpowering mute played by Harold Sakata, who works for Goldfinger, lets Bond know that it will not be easy to come up against his boss. Oddjob has a steel rimmed hat that is a lethal weapon and he soon demonstrates his powerful skills to Bond by decapitating a statue on the golf course they are visiting.<br /><br />Bond discovers that Goldfinger is planning an "Operation Grand Slam" with the ultimate goal of taking over the gold stored at Fort Knox. He plans to have nerve gas released by planes flown over the site while his men are using oxygen masks.<br /><br />As Bond is transported by Goldfinger's personal pilot "Pussy Galore," unforgettably played by Honor Blackman to his Kentucky farm, another famous line is exchanged because, upon hearing her name Bond says... "I must be dreaming!"<br /><br />The scenes are smart, the plot is fascinating, the technology used in cars, airplanes, and weapons... leading edge for the times, thus Goldfinger became a favorite of audiences the world over.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>"Goldfinger" is among the most admired of the Bond films.  It has all of the elements that make Bond such a wonderful hero without any of them getting too far out of balance.  There is the usual Bond cool, a certain amount of violence and danger, a great villain and his henchmen, some cool gadgets, and some beautiful girls with outrageous names.<br /><br />Here, none of them get too far out of balance.  Auric Goldfinger is a manic to be sure, but he is still within the realm of believability (for this kind of fiction).  That is, he is a businessman who is calculating and murderous, but not all powerful in his reach or perfect in his calculations.  Neither is Bond.  The gadgets are there, but don't take over the film as they do in some later editions in the series.  And Honor Blackman's Pussy Galore is still strong and up to competing with Bond rather than simply being there to fall in love with him and to be rescued by him.  She has more to do with the plot than that.<br /><br />And here the villains, while not deep, do have some interesting aspects for adults to figure out as well as being simple enough on the surface for kids to enjoy.  And the Bond films are full of continuity errors that are a hoot to try and pick up.  You can go to IMDB and read about them, if you want to read about them.  They aren't important to the enjoyment of the movie (or the entire series).<br /><br />We enjoy the opening bit before the titles and are off to the races.  The first collision between Bond, Goldfinger, and Oddjob in Miami is classic, as well as the round of golf outside of London.  The scenes in Switzerland have a classic three level shot that really is quite amazing even today.  And the scenes back in America where the big plan is finally revealed along with Bond's interactions with Pussy Galore build to the big climactic fight.<br /><br />Sean Connery was the great Bond and this performance is one of the best.  Gert Froebe was physically perfect for the role.  I did not know until I watched the movie with the director's commentary that his German accent was so thick that every word of dialogue is dubbed in by actor Michael Collins.<br /><br />Terrific.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>In the the third film  of this Bond series this may well be his favorite : (for me it's the best) there are enough reasons to hold this statement.<br />Harold Sakata is the most hated villain in any Bond picture, the maquiavelian mind and overwhelming presence of Auric Goldfinger , the unforgettable swiss landscapes , the girls Honor Blackman who is two steps behind of Daniela Bianchi (From Russia with love) and Claudine Auger (Thunderball) in what beauty concerns , the laser sequence , the poker game , the fine and suggestive dialogues , the ambush in the hall , the battle in Fort Knox and that hair raising final combat in the airplane, the dazzling direction of Guy Hamilton and the spectacular Aston Martin.<br />What else do you need for watching by the first time this one or remind it in case you saw before as a timeless cult movie ?<br />And please beware of any other hat in the head of someone like Odd Job.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>The story has Bond contending with Auric Goldfinger, a wealthy European industrialist who looks to be cornering the world supply of gold.  Only the US reserve at Fort Knox seems out of his reach, but Goldfinger has plans for that problem.  Bond first meets Goldfinger when he catches the super-villain cheating at cards in Miami.  Then he challenges Goldfinger to a friendly game of golf (friendly because Bond allows the cheating to go on), which leads to a break-in at Goldfinger's refinery in the alps.  Captured by Goldfinger, Bonds manages to convince the bad-guy to keep him alive, if only to determine how much Bond has learned of Goldfinger's mysterious "Operation Grand Slam".  (Goldfinger's ill-fated decision to spare Bond caps a scene in which 007 and Foe share the most memorable dialog of any bond flick "You expect me to talk?"; "Why no Mr. Bond, I expect you to DIE!").  <p>So much of "Goldfinger" was recycled for latter Bond films (especially the horrible "View to a Kill" which essentially recycled the plot - only substituting Christopher Walken for Gert Frobe, Silicon Valley for Fort Knox and a blimp for Goldfinger's private jet) that it's easy to take its thrills for granted.  The biggest thrill of all is how the film is like an attempt to film Bond as if it were directed by Hitchkock - the most obvious signs are the score (an edgy orchestral triumph that more than hints Hitchkock's Bernard Herrman), the surprise twist of Goldfinger's (which requires Bond to think fast and w/o the benefit of his gadgets) and a raft of sexually-charged jokes which seem unusually suggestive for the rest of the series - e.g. the laser slowly creeping up 007's crotch; Bond's response when first learning Pussy Galore's name ("I must be dreaming!"); and the famous masculinity-challenging karate-match between Galore and Bond (nowhere else in the series does Bond learn that the way to a woman's heart is found after a total thrashing).  The villain's rotund shape, suggestive of Hitchkock's famous profile, is probably the strongest sign.  The flick jazzes things up with some fun gadgets (including the famous Aston Martin) but knows to keep Bond in trouble (the car doesn't save him from capture) and a wicked-bad henchmen named Odd-Job who lets a razor-edge Derby do his talking for him.  Whether you buy by Hitch-theory or not, this is still one Bond-flick that can't be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A22VNXHU6IZ5MT.html">A22VNXHU6IZ5MT</a><br/><p>WOW!!! this is the best Goldfinger has ever looked or sounded(thanks to Lowry Digital's awesome restoration!),the Blu Ray is simply amazing!

Creator and Author of James Bond, Ian Fleming died on August 12, 1964, before the films' release.<br /> James Bond's mission is to spy on Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) who Bond is keeping a watchful eye on at the Fountainebleau Hilton Hotel Resort in Miami Beach, Florida.  Goldfinger plays a very sneaky hand of gin.  Bond goes up to Goldfinger's hotel room and finds a black bikini-clad Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton) looking through binoculars and the opponent's cards and speaking through an earpiece to Goldfinger. Well, James Bond wins that hand and invites Jill out to dinner as it were.  Actually we see Bond kissing Jill in bed with a bottle of Dom Perignon '53 by the bed side.  In the kitchen, Odd Job (Harold Sakata) knocks Bond out cold.  Later, when Bond comes to, he finds Jill dead on the bed with her body completely painted in gold.

In my personal opinion, GOLDFINGER is the best of the Bond films and certainly my favorite.  In this witty entry, agent 007 (Sean Connery, for his third appearance) investigates a wealthy millionaire(Gert Frobe), only to unveil a plot to break in to the Fort Knox gold reserve.  Rarely does a film so entertaining and funny as GOLDFINGER come around - of course, this is natural for the Bond movies, but GOLDFINGER surpasses any record previously or later set by the 007 adventures.  It has everything, firmly establishing the Bond formula: explosive beginning ("Shocking"); an attractive female lead (Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore); a stunning main title sequence; plenty of humor thrown in with the action; and, of course, Q-Branch's first comedic performance.  Connery is at his greatest as the British super spy; the film also features great performances from it's entire cast.  The score, by John Barry, is one of the finest of the original few films.  Of course, Guy Hamilton's directing is superb as well.  GOLDFINGER has been firmly established as one of the most entertaining films of our time.<p>END TITLE: Don't miss out on this block of gold!</p></br><a href="../users/A2XVRCU5DQBULH.html">A2XVRCU5DQBULH</a><br/><p>Sean Connery's third outing as James Bond is one of the best in the series. This time, Bond goes after German baddie Auric Goldfinger, played by Gert Forbe. There are tons of Bond landmarks including Oddjob, the Aston Martin DB5, a cool theme song, and one heckuva car chase! Plus, Connery is the personification of cool as James Bond. Only Pierce Brosnan can measure up to Connery, but even then he's just as good, not better. Connery is the man and this movie (as well as &quot;From Russia With Love&quot;) proves it. The film has tons of memorable moments that lead up to a fantastic final battle with Bond squaring off against Oddjob in Fort Knox. This scene is one of the best in the series and possibly one of the best fight scenes ever filmed. This is truly a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>This film starts with James Bond 's trip to Miami to investigate Auric Goldfinger (an exotic locale for many in the audience). The purpose is to examine the suspected illegal trade in gold bullion, which contravenes the official monopoly, and can affect the currencies of the Free World. Gold, like diamonds, is produced in South Africa to benefit their mine owners and political allies.<p>It starts by showing Goldfinger cheating at cards: he's not a gentleman! This is a sign of a villain. The actor was chosen to match the description in the novel, not for political correctness. Bond arranges a golf match, flashes a gold bar, and out-cheats the cheater (to show moral superiority?). Would any secret agent act in such a manner? Following Goldfinger to Switzerland, Bond discovers the means used to smuggle gold - like in "The French Connection". Discovery leads to action, and a car chase, then capture. Like other such scenes, it fills up time but does not advance the plot. This chase is without dialogue, so you can read into it what you will. (I wonder if this chase was copied from the Keystone Kops?) The film then shows an industrial laser, a novelty at the time, being used in violation of Federal safety regulations.<p>Bond is flown to Baltimore, avoids Customs, then arrives in Kentucky. Normal prosaic life forms a background to villainy, as in a Hitchcock movie. We see the squadron that will play a part in the attack on Fort Knox. While it may be impossible to quickly steal all this gold, there is another way to make it unavailable to America, and cause the price of gold to skyrocket. Manipulating the supply, whether of oil or electricity, can be very profitable when there is no substitute. The criminals who help in this scheme are paid off then their job is done. The vehicles used tell of corporate placement. To reflect changing political relations, the other villains in this film are Red Chinese.<p>The squadron flies over and releases the binary nerve gas (a proposed weapon of war at the time, like SDI today). The nuclear device is then planted in the bowels of Fort Knox. Of course, this scheme is foiled by the superhuman action of James Bond. The gold supply of America, and the Free World, are saved from economic catastrophe.<p>Henry A. Zeiger's book "Ian Fleming The Spy Who Came in With the Gold" provides a literary analysis in the last chapter. Read it to understand Fleming's novels. These stories only work if you don't think about the plot.<p>Watching this 1965 film is eerie after 9/11/2001. Foreign conspirators exploding a dirty bomb to damage and terrorize America? Aided by those who learned to fly in America? Controlled by a wealthy and evil foreigner to profit from the disaster? Using a poison gas? How incredible in those days!</p></br><a href="../users/A2CZPM110DW516.html">A2CZPM110DW516</a><br/><p>According to Variety, the showbiz bible that tracks a film's box-office performance, the first James Bond film, "Dr. No," did well in the U.S. upon its belated 1963 release, but it was merely the 44th biggest grossing film of the year. "From Russia With Love" did better when issued in spring 1964, but it wasn't until the Christmas release of "Goldfinger" that James Bond became a phemomenon equal to another U.K. import, The Beatles.<p>The film shows its age with 007's reference to the Fab Four (telling "Golden Girl" Shirley Eaton that one should only listen to the moptops while wearing earmuffs), but otherwise remains a sturdy Bond thriller, one that saw the Bond formula more finely tuned than in the previous films (the formula would be perfected in the next film, "Thunderball"). The pre-credit sequence, like the ones for most of the films after 1977, has no connection to the story, but offers a sort of short hand to what the rest of the film holds: tongue-in-cheek humor that softens the somewhat sadistic violence, and a hero as elegant as he is deadly. <p>The villains are arguably Bond's best: Auric Goldfinger whose love of gold leads to his outlandish plan to knock-off Fort Knox, and his right-hand man, Oddjob, as silent as he is deadly, an assassin with a surprise more lethal than a rabbit in his hat. They are well played by Gert Frobe, the German actor previously best known for the "Dr. Mabuse" series, and Harold Sakata. When it comes to Bond babes, Honor Blackman of the original version of TV's "The Avengers," is one of the best. A woman rather than a girl, her Pussy Galore is as smart as she is sexy, and she's one of the few Bondbabes who you believe could teach 007 a thing or two about self-defense. <p>A couple of moments do not ring true, and may inspire unintentional laughs. When Goldfinger brings together the leading figures in organized crime, some of them behave too much like frightened schoolgirls to be believed ("I don't like this," one squeels, when their host turns out the lights), and the soldiers standing guard at Fort Knox fall to the ground a little too quickly when Pussy Galore's gang drops poison from their planes. <p>But such silliness does not detract from an otherwise superb thriller, well-acted (along with "Thunderball," this is Sean Connery's best performance as Bond) and brilliantly scored by John Barry whose title song, co-written by Leslie Bricusse and belted out by Shirley Bassey, rocked the top 40 and made the Bond films as notable for their music as for the gadgets and thrills.</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>IN A NUTSHELL: 5-STAR ENTERTAINMENT THAT PUSHES REALITY TO THE LIMIT & BEYOND<br /><br />In this, the 3rd James Bond feature again starring Sean Connery, [3rd time] we see a magnificent spy epic that essentially created its own genre, here at its very best.

Honor Blackman is the ultimate Bond girl, Gert Frobe, the ultimate Bond villian and Bond's Astin Martin, the ultimate vehicle.  Too bad MGM's DVD isn't the ultimate edition.<br />The film's transfer is tired, well worn and loaded with digital imperfections.  Color fidelity is inconsistant and faded. Flesh tones are too orangy.  Often whole scenes contain images that appear out of focus, blurry or with a cloudy haze about the edges. Film grain, excessive digital noise and smeared colors also plague this transfer.  The sound is a disappointing Mono, not even offering the movie's killer title track, sung by Shirley Bassey, in 5.1, as the laserdisc special edition did nearly four years before.  Go figure.  The name may be Bond but the transfer is junk, pure junk.<br />The plus side: MGM's menu page, its jam packed extra features and an intelligent audio commentary are all sparkling additions to compliment this classic spy thriller.  Given all this investment one wonders why the actual print wasn't given more attention.</p></br><a href="../users/AZDVOFC2MTIM5.html">AZDVOFC2MTIM5</a><br/><p>Goldfinger,007's third movie is the movie that the latter Bond adventures have to measure up to.<br /> Not only are we treated to the first of Q Branch's gadget filled cars(Aston Martin), larger than life villians in both Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) and his silent but deadly henchman Oddjob (Harold Sakata) who wields a razor brimmed hat, but a host of beatiful &quot;Bond Girls&quot; in the ill fated, gold painted Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton) and the risque named Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman).<br /> Goldfinger is filled with memorable scenes which many films,including the Austin Powers series pays homage to.Filled with high adventure,wit, and a style like no movie before,Goldfinger still stands as the ultimate Bond adventure.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>Sean Connery's third outing as James Bond in 1964's superb "Goldfinger" has the 007 franchise solidifying its primary thematic elements.  Connerly is smoothly witty and deadly as the British Secret Service assassin.  The exotic villain is one Auric Goldfinger, played by veteran German actor Gert Frobe, out to corner the world's gold supply. His evil henchman is Oddjob, a giant, mute Korean martial arts expert whose special touch is a bowler hat with a steel rim.  The Bond girl of the moment is Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman), Goldfinger's pilot, who will fall for Bond, as they always do.<br /><br />Bond's assignment is to infiltrate Goldfinger's organization, learn his plans, and stop them.  Bond and Goldfinger will play an exciting game of cate and mouse, with Bond repeatedly surviving close calls to stay close to Goldfinger.  The climax of the movie is Goldfinger's raid on Fort Knox, inside the vault of which Bond will have his final confrontation with the seemingly indestructable Oddjob.<br /><br />Shirley Eaton figures in an iconic scene early in the movie as Jill Masterson, one of Goldfinger's assistants who is seduced by Bond.  Goldfinger gets his revenge by having her body covered with gold paint, causing her death by suffocation.  Bond's discovery of her body helps set him on a collision course with Goldfinger.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as one of the best of the original Bond movies based on Ian Fleming's novels.</p></br><a href="../users/AZAEJB1ECT9HC.html">AZAEJB1ECT9HC</a><br/><p>I can remember clearly when "Goldfinger" premiered in December 1964.  I was 14 at the time and was utterly amazed that this film was playing on Broadway 24 hours a day to accomodate the crowds.  (This would be repeated the following December with "Thunderball," which shockingly created even more excitement than "Goldfinger.)  I'd been a Bond fan since seeing "Dr. No" at my neighborhood theater in June 1963.  (Thats right, there were 3 James Bond films that premiered in the U.S. between May 1963 and Dec. 1964: "Dr. No in May '63, "From Russia With Love" in April '64 and "Goldfinger" in Dec. '64.  Can you imagine: 2 Connery/Bond classics premiered in the same year.  And "Thunderball" premiered almost exactly a year after "Goldfinger."  Now we have to wait at least 2 years or more for each Bond film.<br />Anyway "Goldfinger" is probably the most popular and famous 007 film.  It is great, but I don't think it has aged as well as some of the others.  I still enjoy some of the other Connerys more: "You Only Live Twice," "From Russia With Love" and "Thunderball."  But "Goldfinger," like the others mentioned, is still one of my 10 favorite Bonds.<br />I won't go into most of the positives since you've read them before.  The major flaw that has always annoyed me is, (SPOILER ALERT if you still have not seen one of the most famous films ever made,) how within the few hours, that Pussy Galore has to alert the CIA to Goldfinger's plan, they are able to switch the poison gas and get the thousands of soldiers and residents of Fort Knox, Kentucky to play dead. They even have time to create fake car crashes.  This has always seemed a bit implausible. I know that you are thinking that the Bonds have never been known for plausibility.  Still don't forget that this was still only the 3rd Bond and they were still being played straight at this time, "Moonraker" was still 15 years away.  The American soldiers also featured at the end of the film also just don't seem very American.<br />Anyway, I know I'm being picky.  "Goldfinger" is still a great Bond film and Connery is still the best Bond (Sorry, Daniel.)  He is absolutely at his best in "From Russia With Love," "Thunderball" and this film.<br />The picture on the blu-ray is terrific, beautifully clear.  Most of the extras are from the deluxe dvds released in the late '90s.  I love those "Making of" features, narrated by the great Patrick MacNee, featured on each Bond dvd and blu-ray.<br />In conclusion, if you are a Bond fan or a film fan in general and you have not seen this film, I'm quite surprised.  If you don't own it yet, this blu-ray is certainly the way to go.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP.html">A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP</a><br/><p>Many will argue over which is the best bond movie in the franchise . If you like gadgets, cars with impressive arsenals and catchy names with double entendre than more than likely you're favorite Bond movie might be "Goldfinger". As for me, I prefer "From Russia with Love (1963)" over Goldfinger, just for the quality that From Russia with Love is more plausible and realistic. Now that does not mean I dislike Goldfinger, on the contraire I think its #2 in the bond franchise, leaving # 3 to "Casino Royale".<br /><br />Goldfinger is the first Bind film to introduce gadgets to the series, aside from the storable rifle in "From Russia with Love" here in "Goldfinger we see for the first time the Aston Martin DB5; equipped with all the necessary gadgets for traffic alleviation, enemy destruction, and why not, impress the girls on the way. Goldfinger is also the first 007 movie to have a title sequence with actual lyrics in it; neither two previous films had words in the music, just orchestra. The famous title song is performed by Shirley Bassey, who would perform songs to the James Bond films Goldfinger (1964), Diamonds Are Forever (1971), and Moonraker (1979). She is the only singer to have recorded more than one James Bond theme song.<br /><br />The movie begins with an unforgettable entrance, a pre-title sequence that..Honestly really had nothing to do with the rest of the movie, but hey it works fabulously. Anyways, Auric Goldfinger is a gold smuggler, and a fanatic of gold..Hence Goldfinger. Bond is sent by M to investigate how Goldfinger manages to smuggle gold internationally; Bond later discovers that he is preparing a diabolical plan called "Operation Grand Slam" consisting of eradicating all gold in Fort Knox by A-Bombing it, leaving all the gold radioactive for 58 years and useless...except Goldfingers which he plans to keep and let it duplicate or triplicate its value.<br /><br />While the plot is a bit fantasy, newcomer to the franchise Guy Hamilton, he brings a magnificent touch of believable fantasy. Unfortunately subsequent Bond films tried to cash in on Goldfingers success by borrowing ideas and redoing the plot. Of course all attempts were futile, they were incomparable with Goldfinger. A perfect example would be "A View to a Kill (1985)" it presented a reminiscent plot, only difference instead of gold it was silicon, and instead of Fort Knox it was Silicon Valley. It didn't work, Goldfinger is a timeless classic that works perfect and is in my opinion the best of the extravaganza entries.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />DISC 1:<br />> feature film re-mastered in high definition, using the original negative to bring the image to its best possible quality, eliminating any dirt or flickering.<br />> Audio Commentary featuring Guy Hamilton<br />> Original Mono Track<br />> 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound<br />> 5.1 DTS Theater sound<br /><br />DISC 2<br /><br />> Sean Connery on the set of Goldfinger<br />> Screen tests<br />> On Tour with the Aton Martin DB-5<br />> Honor Blackman Open-Ended Interview<br />> Interactive Guide into The World Of Goldfinger<br />> The Making of Goldfinger<br />> The Goldfinger Phenomenon<br />> Original Publicity Featurette<br />> Original Trailers, T.V.

We've got the over-the-top villians in the form of the filthy rich, despicable, and card-cheating Goldfinger and his bulky henchman Oddjob.  We've got the alluring female (not a pawn, but a powerful woman) played by Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore.  And, of course, the gadgetry, ranging from lasers to the tricked out Aston-Martin with an ejection seat (and more) to Goldfinger's plane to Oddjob's lethal black hat.<br /><br />Anyone who was introduced to Bond via the movies of the 1990's and 2000's should return to this classic (the third Bond movie in a list that will reach 21 with 2006's release of Casino Royale) to see where it all came from.  The later Bond movies skimp on plot and go for awe-inspiring death-defying tricks whenever possible.  Goldfinger has some great tricks, of course, but also excellent dialogue and a well-crafted plot.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>This is the quintessential James Bond film.  If our civilization wanted to prepare a time capsule to save for the 31st century, this would be the James Bond film we would want to enclose.  Although I personally think that FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is a slightly better film, absolutely no James Bond pulls all the essential Bond elements together more perfectly.  In fact, if there is a James Bond formula (and there is), it was completed to perfection in GOLDFINGER.  Probably the best opening song of any Bond film, probably the best Bond villain and villain name, one of the best love interests and names, the definitive car (in the books Bond is attached to a Bentley, but in the films we primarily associate him with his Aston Martin), and best evil henchman (Odd Job).  And possibly the best throwaway line in all the Bond films.  As a laser cuts through the metal slab upon which Goldfinger has strapped Bond, he yells, "Do you expect for me to talk?"  "No, Mr. Bond, I expect for you to die."<p>This movie has permeated popular culture to a degree matched by few films.  Nearly all the elements we associate with suave, debonair spies come from this film, though some influences are more esoteric.  Extreme Monty Python fans know that that merry band borrowed both their name and the typeface used in on their show from the side of Pussy Galore's airplanes, which read, "Pussy Galore's Flying Circus."  <p>Of all the Bond films, this one has my favorite villain in Gert Frobe.  Unbelievably, in filming it turned out that Frobe's English was too marginal for him to supply his own dialog, so in the studio they had another actor dub in all Goldfinger's lines.  The dubbing is seamless, and it is nearly impossible to detect that Frobe's own voice wasn't utilized.  <p>This was also the first Bond film to feature what is now the standard and essential international jet setting.  DR. NO was filmed pretty much entirely in Jamaica, and although FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE had some exotic locales, most of it was shot in Istanbul or on the Orient Express.  In GOLDFINGER, however, Bond earns major frequent flier miles.  He starts off in Miami, and then goes back to a couple of sites in England.  After a channel crossing to Switzerland, he is transported to the US and Louisville, Kentucky and from there to Fort Knox.  This kind of diversity is now an absolute requirement of any Bond outing.  One isn't at all surprised if a Bond film starts off in Mongolia, proceeds to the Balkan Islands, briefly to England, from there to Alaska, with the grand finale in an island in the Atlantic, meeting beautiful women and foiling dastardly villains at every step along the way.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / MGM-FOX / Region A<br />Aspect ratio: 1.67:1<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50 / BD+ / High Profile 4.1<br />Running time: 1:50:01<br />Movie size: 29,44 GB<br />Disc size: 44,57 GB<br />Total bit rate: 35.69 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 29.23 Mbps<br /><br />DTS-HD Master Audio English 2900 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 2900 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 24-bit)<br />Dolby Digital Audio French 448 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 448 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio Spanish 448 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 448 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio English 224 kbps 2.0 / 48 kHz / 224 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio English 224 kbps 2.0 / 48 kHz / 224 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio English 224 kbps 2.0 / 48 kHz / 224 kbps<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH, Cantonese, Mandarin, French, Korean, Spanish<br />Number of chapters: 32<br /><br />#Commentaries by: director Guy Hamilton Dolby Digital 1.0,the cast and crew Dolby Digital 1.0<br />#Original Radio Interviews With Sean Connery<br />#Sean Connery From the Set of Goldfinger<br />#Screen Tests (HD - 5m:39s)<br />#On Tour with the Aston Martin DB5 (HD - 11m:43s)<br />#Honor Blackman open-ended interview<br />#Documentaries<br />--The Making of Goldfinger (HD - 26m)<br />--The Goldfinger Phenomenon (HD - 29m:14s)<br />#007 Mission Control: Interactive Guide into the World of Goldfinger<br />#Original publicity featurette<br /># Original theatrical trailer (HD - 3m:08s)<br />#TV Spots and radio communications<br />#Image database</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>I thought it would be fun to see a Bond movie.  Mostly, I've only seen parts of movies on the tv when i was a kid.  The movie started out pretty well, with modest intrigue and pacing as it presented the Bond gadgets and women.  However, the second half really drags and is just one non-sequiter after another.  I mean, there's supposed to be a litte suspense and cleverness, right? Of course, the movie is not about plot, but after awhile the bone head script is really annoying.  Also, the movie feels dated, the action is slow and cheesy, and it's shot in a very clunky and dull style. Just like the duck on Sean's head in the opening sequence, this one is for the birds!</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I've only seen a couple of Bond movies. I certainly would not call myself a 'fan'! I've seen two Timothy Dalton movies, and of course, the recent Casino Royale. When asked if I wanted to go see a special 'digital' screening at the cinema, I thought "why not?" I haven't seen any Sean Connery Bond movies and a few people say he's the best Bond. My mum disagrees, she seems to have a thing for Roger Moore.<br /><br />I've never been so disappointed in a film before. For starters, the cinema was really hot, which severely affected my viewing. And I just didn't like Sean Connery. For me, he's definitely got better with age (Entrapment for example), but I just did not like him as Bond. Every line he said was absolutely DRIPPING with innuendo, normally ended with a wink or a smirk. And I mean dripping. It's called subtlety, and Timothy Dalton had some. And where is his Scottish? It sounded seriously toned down. He's sexy with a Scottish accent! Plus, I think I was coughing up furballs at the sight of his chest. It looks like a extremely furry animal died on it. Ugh! Can you guess I like no hair on my men?<br /><br />For me, Goldfinger was the longest (it felt that way!) and dullest Bond movie. After really liking Casino Royale, this was a major let down. There's nothing memorable about it, and for a film that had a budget bigger than the first two combined, Sean Connery doesn't set foot outside Pinewood Studios, even though Bond is shown in America etc, in the film. What did they spend the budget on? Nothing major that I could see. The only thing I really liked about Goldfinger, was the girl who was asphyxiated by being covered in gold paint. Such a good look, but an absolute pain to get off I bet! Her skin was probably red raw from scrubbing at it that much.<br /><br />I really didn't like Goldfinger. What am I not seeing? People seem to rave about it. I just don't see it. I'll stick to Daniel Craig in his blue shorts. Hairless. Sean Connery may be white haired and an old man, but he's good, just not as Bond I'm afraid.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EBJ93E1T50RT.html">A1EBJ93E1T50RT</a><br/><p>Oh, to have lived in the 1960s, when a great Bond film came out Every. Single. Year.  "Goldfinger" represents the artistic nirvana of the James Bond series, before Connery lost interest in the role, when his powers as 007 were at their greatest.<p>"Goldfinger" has an interesting two-part plot structure in which Auric Goldfinger is not actually revealed to be a mega-villain until the second half.  The first 55 minutes involve luscious locales, a couple of shocking death sequences (most notably Tilly Masterson's death by hat mere minutes after her entry into the film), and the funniest golf game in history (until the advent of Tony Soprano).  Once the scene shifts to Kentucky, and Goldfinger's plan is revealed, Bond has little to do except lounge around in polo shirts or say things like "He blew a fuse".  Thanks to the new DVD box set, even 40 years later it's instantly understandable why half the world's men want to be Sean Connery.<p>The special edition DVD is one of the best in the series.  Unlike "Dr. No" and "From Russia...", there are two audio commentary tracks.  The first, produced years ago for the laserdisc, features edited sound bites from director Guy Hamilton and other cast members.  The second, made for the DVD, has clips only from crewmembers (beware the misleading print on the back cover), and thus there's plenty of time for Bond expert John Cork to make some interesting scholarly points about how dated the Ian Fleming novels are, and what elements of Bonds character did not survive the 1970s.  Indeed from this track you learn a lot more about the original "Goldfinger" novel, and you'll hear opinions as to why the story works better as a movie.  These are worthy points and they set the commentary track above the cut-and-paste variety.<p>The two "documentaries" are also above-average.  The making-of feature, narrated by Patrick Macnee, features the fall-off-the-couch laughing screen test of Theodore Bikel as Goldfinger... evidently playing the role as a college professor!  The second feature is all about the marketing of "Goldfinger".  There are some awesome finds in here, such as the picture of a fat Prince Charles riding in a toy Aston Martin DB-5, or the Vicks commercial featuring Harold Sakata demolishing an American suburb with his persistent cough.  There's also a truly dreadful 1964 US promotional film, with grainy black-and-white footage from the movie and the snarkiest voice-over ever.  "Looks like he passed the audition."<p>And the real great moment here is Connery's well-timed 1964 jab at the Beatles.  Final proof that the Bond movies are, in fact, still as relevant as ever.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM.html">A2VP7JOT3K7PFM</a><br/><p>XXXXX<br /><br />It's difficult to believe that this movie is almost 45 years old (counting from the date of this review).<br /><br />(Sir) Sean Connery was in six EON (or "official") movies with him starring as James Bond.  They were: (1) Dr. No (1962) (2) From Russia with Love (1963) (3) Goldfinger (1964) (4) Thunderball (1965) (5) You Only Live Twice (1967) and (6) Diamonds are Forever (1971).<br /><br />As you can see from the above list, "Goldfinger" is the third spy film of the British Bond series.  As well, it is the third to star Connery as the fictional MI6 agent Commander James Bond (code number 007).<br /><br />This movie is based on the 1959 novel "Goldfinger" by Ian Fleming (1908 to 1964).<br /><br />The story has Bond following gold smuggler Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe whose voice was dubbed) who plans a nuclear detonation inside the Fort Knox gold depository thus making the gold supply radioactive for 58 years.  This would cause economic chaos in the West and increase the value of Goldfinger's non-radioactive gold (that he has stashed away) many times.<br /><br />(Look at Goldfinger's first name "Auric" closely.  The word gold comes from the Latin word "aurum."  "Au" is the chemical symbol for gold.)<br /><br />This was the first Bond movie to use a pop singer (Shirley Bassey) to sing the theme song during the titles.  The lyrics of the title song were co-written by Anthony Newley.  Bassey would go on to sing the theme song in two other Bond movies.<br /><br />Several memorable scenes frequent this movie such as:<br /><br />(1) the dead woman painted in gold<br />(2) Goldfinger's Korean mute manservant named Oddjob (Olympic silver medalist weight lifter Harold Sakata) who uses his Bowler hat as a lethal frizbee<br />(3) Goldfinger attempting to slice Bond in half with a laser<br />(4) the modified Aston Martin DB5 car that has a host of gadgets such as a handy passenger ejector seat<br />(5) the movie's double climatic ending<br /><br />Another thing memorable about this movie is its witty dialogue.  For example, take the scene where Bond is tied spread-eagled to a slab of gold with a laser beam slowly inching up between his legs threatening to cut him in half:<br /><br />Bond: "Do you expect me to talk?"<br />Goldfinger: "No, Mr. Bond.  I expect you to die!!"<br /><br />Connery brings his characteristic savoir fare to the role.  Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore (Goldfinger's personal pilot) does a good job as an independent and strong Bond girl.  Gert Frobe gives an excellent performance as Goldfinger.  (I found it odd that in the beginning and end credits that Blackman is given first billing over Frobe who plays the title character.)<br /><br />M, Q, Miss Moneypenny, and Felix all appear in this movie.<br /><br />Filming was primarily in Switzerland, Miami, and London, England.<br /><br />Some trivia: Burt Kwouk has a small part in this movie.  He became famous for playing "Kato" in the Pink Panther series starring Peter Sellers.<br /><br />Total box office for this movie was about one-hundred and twenty-five million dollars.  In today's dollars, that's about eight-hundred and seventy million making this movie the first official Bond blockbuster.<br /><br />The DVD (the one released in Feb., 2007) is flawless in picture and sound quality.  The picture has been digitally restored and I'm sure the picture is just as good (if not better!!) than when it was released almost 45 years ago.  As well, there is one extra in the form of an audio commentary.<br /><br />Finally, here is some information to consider.  This DVD is actually the first disc of the two-disc "Ultimate Edition."  Bond enthusiasts might want to purchase this two-disc Ultimate Edition since the second disc has "the best collection of special features ever assembled for Bond."  (Unfortunately, the Ultimate Edition is no longer available but it can be purchased second-hand.)<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie is the first official Bond blockbuster thus making it a must-see!!!<br /><br />(1964;  1 hr, 50 min;  wide screen;  32 scenes)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>When compared to a "serious" spy film, e.g. the BBC's excellent adaptations of John le Carre's TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY and SMILEY'S PEOPLE (both starring the late Sir Alec Guiness), GOLDFINGER is positively silly. But it works, mostly because of the presence of Sean Connery.<p>Here, Comdr. Bond foils an attempt by Auric Goldfinger to destroy the value of the bullion held in Fort Knox. Gadgets and girls abound. The best of the former is a laser that causes even the redoubtable Commander to wince at the prospect of losing the family jewels. And then there's Ms. P. Galore (Honor Blackman). How is it that modern-day Bond Babes don't have such, um, promising monikers? And the rock-like Oddjob (Harold Sakata) with his lethal hat is one of the most engaging thugs ever to toss 007 into a heap.<p>Sean Connery will go down in movie history as the essence of Bond. Next to him, all others pale - even runner-up Pierce Brosnan. Imagine Connery, a Scot, in a tux jacket and kilt. Then picture PB in the same costume. See what I mean? Connery has the voice, physical stature, and rakish glint in his eyes to pull it off. Sean should be acclaimed King in Westminster Abbey.<p>I'm giving GOLDFINGER 5 stars not because it's a great film, but because it's perhaps the best of several with Connery as Bond, and the one that could well immortalize Sean to human history in that role.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>Appropriately enough the first of the series to have a really imaginative use of colour, Goldfinger is in many ways the most visually sensual of the films, the unforgettable image of Shirley Eaton's golden girl reflected in a golden glow to much of Ted Moore's cinematography. It's oozing with striking and surreal imagery, from Oddjob's menacing shadow on the hotel room wall, to the little old lady with machine gun or Bond making his entry by unzipping his wetsuit to reveal an evening one underneath. Ken Adam's production design is his possibly his finest hour, genuine architecture of the imagination that is at once both fantastic and strangely credible, maintaining a sense of scale and verisimilitude by his use of ceilings on the smaller sets.<br /><br />It's also the one that set the Bond formula in stone, something that would later become more a hindrance than a help to the series before something more radical was attempted with Casino Royale. Aside from establishing the trend for irrelevant but enjoyable pretitle sequences, it is from here on that the gadgets begin to assume a more prominent role. However, unlike most of the Roger Moore efforts, they are no match for Bond's own wits - even the famed Aston Martin DB5 does not save him. After putting it through its paces, he is left to his own initiative.<br /><br />There is no getting away from the overtly sexist approach here ("Dink, say goodbye to Felix - man talk."). Even Blackman's villainy seems inextricably linked to her lesbianism ("You can turn off the charm, I'm immune") but one good one from Bond and she's on the side of the angels.<br /><br />As with all Bond films, many of the cast are dubbed - in this case, Frobe was dubbed by actor Michael Collins. Regardless, his Auric Goldfinger is easily the best of the Bond super-villains, and comes equipped with the best line in the series as Bond, strapped down in front of the laser beam (in the novel it was a chainsaw), asks if he expects him to talk: "No Mr Bond, I expect you to die." And for possibly the only time in the series, you think that maybe Bond really has had it. Incredibly enjoyable and one of the best-paced entries in the series, it's not hard to see why this is many people's favorite Bond film. It may be formulaic, but then the formula still worked wonders.<br /><br />While all the extras from the previous release have been carried over, there are not as many new features as you might expect. Most interesting are Theodore Bikel and Tito Vandis' screen tests as Goldfinger, but there are also somewhat awkwardly presented archive interviews with Connery and Honor Blackman as well as a featurette about the Aston Martin DB5, though perhaps the most enjoyable remain the radio spots from the original release.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>Dr. No was a wonderful start to the Bond franchise.  From Russia With Love returned with even more.  Now, Goldfinger has brought the series to the peak.  The highest budget of the three has been granted to Goldfinger, thus creating impressive action sequences and shot in teriffic locations.  But don't stop there.  Goldfinger is packed with memorable moments that places this film in the category of ultimate classic Bond.<br /><br />While SPECTRE was never referred to in this film, I never missed it or thought about it once.  Auric Goldfinger and his henchman "Oddjob" went above and beyond as the villains of this film.  Auric is obsessed with gold, and his ultimate plan is to destroy the gold supply of Fort Knox, so that his own supply can multiply ten times in value.  Oddjob's business is to take care of 007, and takes great pleasure in attempting so, armed with a hat sharp as a knife and martial art skills that are no match for the double 0.<br /><br />Goldfinger is a great feel good movie, highly entertainig - especially for its day.  Every scene is wonderful, whether it is action, brilliant lines and moves by the villains, chemistry between Bond and Pussy Galore, or sneaky and intellgient games such as the Goldfinger/Bond scene on the golf course.  But the showstopper is certainly the grand finale, operation "Grand Slam" where Auric and his men take over Fort Knox.  Oddjob and Bond have a final showdown inside that is a terrific matchup that was accompanied without music, and worked out quite well.<br /><br />The story to Goldfinger is smart and fun, but maybe not as in-depth as the previous From Russia With Love.  But overall, this Bond film has it all and is possibly the most balanced Bond film ever made, giving us a complete film of entertainment that is unforgettable.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 4.5<br />Charcaters - 5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 5</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>The five stars above is for the movie and this clear, digitally cleaned up transfer only. MGM has chosen to keep the second disc of extras for the boxed set ONLY. While I would normally appreciate that if the boxed sets had been broken up either chronologically or by star, I'm a bit frustrated as there are many films I don't want in the boxed set (they were randomly assigned to force fans to buy all the sets to get all the Connery films or Bronsnan, etc.). That's great marketing but lousy customer service.<br /><br />The good news--To the film itself--"Goldfinger" has never looked this good on DVD. While we do get the commentary track ported over from the previous release, we don't any of the extras there nor the new extras (as mentioned) produced for the new boxed set. I suspect a double dip will be down the line once MGM decides to release this to Blu-Ray. It's sad really because, of all the Bond films, this one and "From Russia With Love" deserve the deluxe treatment. While I like "Dr. No", "Goldfinger" really established the Bond personna in full mode while "From Russia with Love" gave us Bond with minimal gadgets and lots of suspense. Personally, I love all the Connery films (well, except "Never Say Never" which isn't "canon" Bond)but the least they could do would be to focus their efforts on providing additional extras for some of the best in the series.<br /><br />The commentary track featuring director Guy Hamilton and members of the crew(if my memory serves here I kept skipping around between regular audio and the commentary) is quite good and filled with some wonderful bits of trivia about shooting the movie. On the other hand, I would have liked to see some featurettes on the development of the Bond films. Oh well I guess we can't have it all.<br /><br />That said, you can't go wrong with this film (even if the extras leaving you wanting more). I would also like to see a featurette on some point discussing how Hitchcock's films like "North by Northwest" influenced the Bond series. I recommend this release but with reservations because of the lack of extras. If you just want the film, this is a fine release.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>"Goldfinger" was the third movie in the Bond series. This movie set the standard for the Bond genre, and is generally regarded as one of the best Bond films, if not the best.<br /><br />Gadgetry goes high-tech in this movie and will stay with Bond in every film from this point forward (with the exception of "On Her Majesty's Secret Service). In this movie we have a cutting laser; very impressive technology for 1964 when the laser was still a very new device. A lot of poetic license was used for this special effect since even visible light lasers can barely be seen under most circumstances, and high power cutting lasers can not be seen at all.<br /><br />Sean Connery appears very confident in this film. His style of Bond is well developed by this point and remains the standard by which all other actors playing Bond are measured. Most men at some point in their lives (and perhaps some women too!) want to be the James Bond portrayed by Sean Connery in this movie.<br /><br />There are very cool gadgets in this movie. The Aston-Martin DB-5 has to be the best. Everyone needs a car with machine guns, a smoke screen and an ejection seat (which only covers a few of the neat features). Apparently, you do not want an Aston-Martin near a Ford Mustang, as Tilly Masterson found out. Oddjob's hat, while low tech, presaged the martial arts movies of the 70's. The cargo plane with the Boeing 747 style front end was very interesting. Goldfinger's model of Fort Knox was very good. Goldfinger also provided the best way to get rid of a body in the 60's. One detail I had missed on previous viewings of this movie was the license plate on Goldfinger's car. How could I have missed that?<br /><br />The first portion of the movie provides two pieces of information. First, Goldfinger loves gold. Second, Goldfinger has something going, but what? The second portion of the movie begins when it's revealed that Goldfinger plans to attack Fort Knox. Goldfinger would be very brave, or very stupid, to attack Fort Knox. But even that is not the end of the plot. Goldfinger plans on setting off a nuclear bomb in Fort Knox to contaminate the U.S. gold reserves, making Goldfinger's gold even more valuable. I guess you can never be too rich. Fortunately James Bond is in all the right places at all the right times, though he risks death more than once in the process.<br /><br />The locales become more exotic with each Bond movie. This time we get to go to Switzerland, England, and exotic Kentucky (well, Fort Knox is pretty exotic). Being on location adds a lot of realism to these films.<br /><br />The biggest advantage to the Ultimate Edition of Goldfinger is the cleaned picture.  The techniques used to clean the picture were explained in a feature in the Ultimate Edition of "Dr. No."  If you are looking to upgrade from a VHS tape or the first DVD release, or you are a first time buyer of "Goldfinger," I recommend this edition.<br /><br />This version of "Goldfinger" has a few extras that are different from the Special Edition DVD.  There are screen tests and a featurette, "On Tour with the Aston Martin DB-5."  There is also an open ended interview with Honor Blackman.  As with the other Ultimate Editions, the photographs in the images sections play like a slide show.  I believe nearly all the remaining extras were available in previous releases.<br /><br />This movie is a lot of fun. Grab yourself a bowl of popcorn, sit back and spend a couple of hours in a world and a time that may feel like long ago, but really was not.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>"Goldfinger" was the third movie in the Bond series.

Perhaps it is the best James Bond film of he entire series. This one film contains many definitive aspects of all the James Bond films in the series. GOLDFINGER is very different from its two predecessors. The level of sophistication is much higher. Visually it is more stunning and is lavishly produced establishing a high standard for many of the cinematic elements associated with a James Bond film. Sean Connery gives his most sophisticated and distinguished performance as James Bond in GOLDFINGER. His friendly and easygoing approach in this film combined with his look of determination and confidence, wit, charm and a physical dexterity all add to his arsenal for self-preservation in order to see the job of eliminating the opposition to fruition. Even the main villain Goldfinger, who is more menacing and cunningly diabolical than his predecessors, is given greater depth by screenwriters Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn. Gert Frobe's performance and visual presence as Goldfinger is one of the highlights of this film and the series. He is a constant menace to Bond as they play a cat and mouse game throughout the film. The intriguing golf game is a highlight of their confrontation. Once again another distinctive element to the Bond formula is introduced during the golf game in the form of Oddjob, the main villain's henchman who kills his victims with a steal edged bowler hat. Returning to Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn, it can be seen that the script of GOLDFINGER is perhaps the best structured and balanced giving the plot elements, action sequences and the familiar Bond gadgets integrated treatment producing a solid story. Their script is also rich with character development meticulously incorporated into the story, which is never intrusive to the film's flow but is part of the cohesiveness of all the visuals skillfully directed by Guy Hamilton and expertly edited together by Peter Hunt. Of those visuals it is Production Designer Ken Adam's distinctive set designs that also help define the film's "Bond look" where he creates a unique look of functionally modern almost futuristic sets that dominate the screen with his iconic style. Cinematographer Ted Moore did some of his best work on this film utilizing photographic techniques to produce a dynamic and lavish look to this film. John Barry composed (along with lyricists Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley) the main title to GOLDFINGER sung by Shirley Bassey, which is probably the most recognizable song from the series and immediately brings to mind images of James Bond to this day. This melody used and often referred to throughout the score integrates the James Bond Theme along with John Barry's own distinctive musical motifs and style once again lending credence that this is the definitive Bond film when combined with all the other superlative elements presented in GOLDFINGER. The "Bond Girls" and their specific role in the Bond formula are best represented yet uniquely presented in GOLDFINGER seeing that the formula in this film is tweaked a bit. Usually the formula dictates that Bond has one leading female partner who accompanies him on and off during his exploits. There is also the sacrificial lamb that becomes sexually involved with Bond but along the way pays the ultimate sacrifice, which only intensifies Bond's resolve to vanquish the villain. Also, there may be a female villain who Bond also becomes sexually involved in and her fate varies from film to film. GOLDFINGER as a film stands on its own. It is good filmmaking. As a James Bond film it could easily be considered the best of the series.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G9FX1KV45N41.html">A1G9FX1KV45N41</a><br/><p>One of the more realistic Bond's i.e. one that wasn't completely impossible for it to happen. James Bond sets out to foil the evil plans of Auric Goldfinger to destroy the gold reserves at Fort Knox, in cahoots with Red China. Shooting though several Jamaica, Miami, Switzerland and Kentucky, Bond must battle Goldfinger's brutal minions. Especially the silent, ruthlessly efficient, seemingly invincible and oddly charismatic Oddjob.<br /><br />The plot unfolds slowly but steadily, with witty repartee, and 60's style action.<br /><br />And of course the gorgeous girls bond romances. There is the lovely Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton) , who is cruelly murdered by Goldfinger by being coated in gold paint.  The only parts of the Bond movies that I never enjoy is when one of the beautiful girls die.  They actually make me rather sad actually.<br /><br />The extremely Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman) plays another one of Goldfinger's team and a dangerous adversary for Bond, but great to see her come out well and wooed by Bond onto the side of good (even though she claims at the beginning to be immune to charm).<br /><br />Each of the Bond girls has their own special charm, and Pussy not only knows how to be a smooth operator, she has a body that makes any clothes looks stunning, with a backside that stops conversation. I liked her , I really liked her, and was just so glad she didn't end up as one of the Bond girls who didn't make it through.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJOEQSRX2IBM.html">A1BJOEQSRX2IBM</a><br/><p>The third in the Bond series is also the best. Quintessential Bond all the way. All the elements are here; beautiful girls, picturesque vistas,  non-stop action, lots of gadgets, memorable villains and more than a  healthy dose of witticisms. Connery was in peak form and had it down cold,  he 'was' Bond and everybody knows he is the best and his first three Bond  films are the best in the series. Filled with many now classic scenes such  as the sight of beautiful Shirley Eaton covered in gold paint on Bond's bed  and Bond tied down to a metal table with a deadly laser pointed right on  his crotch, his most often used asset. Also features two of the series best  villains; greedy Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) and his henchman Oddjob with  his killer bowler hat. Also with memorable gadgets; Bond's fully loaded  Aston-Martin ranks among the series best and most memorable gadgets. And it  also features Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore (!) one of the best of all the  Bond girls. All that and a knockout climax that has Bond fighting Oddjob in  the bowels of Fort Know while handcuffed to an atomic time bomb. A  wonderfully playful score accompanies all the action and a little bit of  cold-war paranoia spread around. A towering achievement that ranks among  the best action films of all time. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a  9!</p></br><a href="../users/AL4MKKO24563R.html">AL4MKKO24563R</a><br/><p>I know -- the ad line for every Bond film makes that statement. However, in this case, it's a reasonable claim. Goldfinger was the blueprint for the entire series. Although there have been several great Bond films since, the series never again reached the high point it attained with Goldfinger. The films has the best of just about everything of the series: the best heroine (Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore); the best villains (Gert Frobe as Goldfinger and Harold Sakata as Oddjob); the best plot; the best theme song; the best gadget (the famous Aston Martin) and, of course, the best Bond, Sean Connery. When he filmed Goldfinger, Connery had firmly defined himself as James Bond, but had not yet grown tired of the role. The gadgetry is eye-popping, even to today's audiences, but does not overwhelm the entire film as many of the later Bond entries do. This is one of the few films in the series that actually improved upon the original Ian Fleming novel. Goldfinger has transcended the series and become one of the classic cult films of the 1960's. In every way possible, Goldfinger is a true classic.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>As is oft quoted, this movie is where all the ingredients came together.  Whether this is your favourite Bond movie or not, probably depends mostly on how you appreciated the change in tone that happened with this movie.  Guy Hamilton took over directing duties, and recognised the whole tongue in cheek potential of the franchise, as exemplified by the opening sequence, and ran with that.  This opening sequence has Bond swim up `disguised' with a duck on his head, and run around setting charges in an extravagant Ken Adams designed set, before suavely peeling back the dry suit to reveal an immaculate white suit, flourishing a carnation for his lapel from who-knows-where, and sauntering in to seduce a lady in a bar.  This mini-story within a story exemplifies all that was to come in the movie and movies to follow.  Suave, funny, action packed, and of course just a little bit over the top.<br /><br />Much is said of the fact that gadgets came to the fore - the Aston Martin is introduced in spectacular form, and the women are both beautiful and played by talented actresses.  Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore was the first leading Bond lady who actually had previous acting experience (and at 36, the oldest actress to play a Bond lady).  John Barry has also crafted a fully realised score for the movie far superior to his earlier work on Bond movies.  However, two things above all make Goldfinger a success.  Firstly, Sean Connery is by now completely at home with the character.  His comfort in the role without yet being tired of it adds immeasurably to the charm of the movie.  Secondly, the true measure of a Bond movie is in how good the villain is - and Gert Frobe makes a fantastic megalomaniac.  You only have to check out the two screen tests for other actors to realise just how different the movie would have been without his exuberant style.  The character, as well as key movie plotlines, rely on his bombastic enthusiasm for boasting, and Frobe makes this a believable trait.<br /><br />Whether you like the comedic elements or not, the fact is that Guy Hamilton clearly got the balance right to appeal to the widest possible audience.  Goldfinger was not just a hit - it was a phenomenon.  This is amply demonstrated in the extras, which include all of the Special Edition extras plus various period interviews and feauturettes, including an open-ended interview with Honor Blackman, on set chat with Connery, the aforementioned screen tests and a 10 minute BBC feature on the Aston Martin touring to promote the film.  Despite these additions, the best of all is still the entertaining and thorough half hour documentary and movie commentary from the Special Edition.<br /><br />In reality, as a film Goldfinger does not deserve 5 stars.  But this is not reality - this is entertainment.  And as the most defining iconic movie of a 20th Century hero, this movie has more than enough entertainment value to override the quibbles and make this a 5 star success.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>GOLDFINGER contains a well-balanced level of depth and action leaving one emotionally charged, thrilled and entertained. This is Sean Connery's finest James Bond film and perhaps the definitive James Bond film of the entire series giving the outstanding and underrated ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE serious competition in that department after much contemplation.<br /><br />The golden girl, Oddjob's bowler hat, Goldfinger's lethal laser, the Astin Martin DB5 with modifications introduced by Q, and Shirley Bassey's legendary rendition of the theme song belted out over the titles immediately became an integral part of the James Bond lore and remained in the psyche of the public.<br /><br />Director Guy Hamilton, screen writers Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn and editor Peter Hunt were able to produce a solid, well balanced, entertaining film that does not rely totally on the spectacle and whimsy that would weaken the subsequent entries in the series.<br /><br />Production designer Ken Adam and art director Peter Murton gave the production a stunning and lavish distinction. The Fort Knox set and Goldfinger's playroom at his stud ranch was a testament to imagination and achievement. John Barry finally honed his distinctive style to perfection with this memorable score and set a benchmark of distinct and stylistic scoring for the James Bond series.<br /><br />Sean Connery's performance as James Bond is a well honed mix of determination, humor and dedication to that end of getting the job done at all costs. He brings a wry humor to the role in this film, demonstrates compassion for the opposite sex (despite what he detractors may say) and eliminates all those who present evil and malevolence to our way of life with cold detachment. He is that blunt instrument of his government but Connery does it with such aplomb.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Whether it's my nostalgia talking or a plain fact, I've always looked at this as the best James Bond film ever produced. It had the most memorable characters and scenes I can remember over these four decades of Bond films. Yes, it's dated by now and not as exciting as when it came out, but it's a treasure among the films of the 1960s.<br /><br />It has a winning combination of good action, drama, romance and comedy. Best of all, it has great characters that all of us who first saw it years ago still remember: "Auric Goldfinger," Oddjob,." and - of course - "Pussy Galore," one of the all-time great names in the history of film!<br /><br />The story moves fast without overdoing the action. Sure some of it - especially today - looks contrived and corny, but that's part of the fun and charm of the film. Meanwhile, Bond's Aston-Martin DB5 sports car will never go out of style. It's still very cool.....like the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>I won't repeat what just about everyone else says here: GOLDFINGER is probably the best James Bond movie ever made.  It's a slick, well-oiled machine that established a formula still in use today, 40 years later!<br /><br />My hat is off to the screenwriters: in the original novel, Auric Goldfinger plans to rob Fort Knox using a system of trains and ships, an impossible and unbelievable task.  That the screenwriters decided to add the A-bomb element to Goldfinger's plan (irradiating the US gold supply to make his own more valuable) is, as Bond says, "inspired."<br /><br />(The novel's buzzsaw inching forward between 007's legs becomes an industrial laser, making for another classic scene).<br /><br />I've seen this movie most of my watching life, and I could put it in the DVD player right now and watch it again.<br /><br />That's a great movie, no matter how you slice (or laser) it.</p></br></body></html>

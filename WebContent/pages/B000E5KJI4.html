The story is known to most people who were probably coerced to read it in either high school or college as it was required reading in order to receives a passing grade.  Most probably found the tale difficult to read as it was written in prose, which left most readers missing a story full of intrigue as humans and gods are faced with deceit, love, bereavement, faith, war, heroism, despotism, and much more.  The divine portion of the Iliad is immense as the god's choices always reflect upon the humans, but in Troy Wolfgang Petersen decides to focus on the human aspects of the tale.  This creates an interesting perspective on the story as the many characters still deceive, kill, love, commit heroic deeds, and much more.<br /><br />Troy begins with depicting Agamemnon of Mycenae (Brian Cox) who is on the war path as he seeks to conquer all of Greece and become the king of kings.  The many battles that Agamemnon faces are decided with very little bloodshed as he suggests to each king that if their best warrior can beat his best warrior then he will retreat, but if his best warrior wins then the opposing king will have to pledge his legion to him.  Agamemnon's best warrior is Achilles (Brad Pitt) who seeks immortal fame through the battles that he fights and he also strengthens the confidence of the men in the troops.  However, Achilles also believes in his independence as he believes that the kings should fight their own fights, which makes it difficult for Agamemnon to handle Achilles.<br /><br />The Menelaus of Sparta (Brendan Gleeson) is welcoming peace with Troy as Hector (Eric Bana), the throne prince of Troy, is visiting Sparta with the duty of declaring peace.  In joy Menelaus and Hector celebrate the truce between the cities while Hector's younger brother brother Paris (Orlando Bloom) is secretively courting Menelaus' wife Helen (Diane Kruger).  On the voyage back across the Aegean Sea Paris reveals the secret to Hector as he has persuaded Helen to return to Troy with him as they have fallen in love with one another.  Hector is furious as he realizes that the truce is broken and a war might be approaching in the near future unless they return Helen to Sparta.  Nevertheless, Helen sails to Troy with Paris as Hector is not willing to give up his little brothers life on account of his love for Helen.<br /><br />Wrathful vengeance boils within the veins of Menelaus as he discovers that Helen has left him for one of the princes of Troy, which leads him to visit his brother Agamemnon in a request to seek his vengeance on Troy.  Agamemnon understands that Helen's abandonment of his brother has provided him with an opportunity to ensemble all the troops of Greece to attack Troy, and his advisors recommend that they also bring Achilles.  This is something that Agamemnon resents, as he hates Achilles and his independent manners.  Despite his own dislike for the man Agamemnon listens to his advisors as he send for him through Odysseus (Sean Bean), the only person that Achilles respects.  When all troops arrive they set sail for Troy as Agamemnon has gathered the largest army ever, which is 50,000 men strong.<br /><br />When the many ships arrive to Troy the audience is to see a siege of enormous proportions as the 50,000 men settle on the beach outside Troy.  The siege of Troy offers many interesting views of the characters as intrigue begins to build up and create different camps within the Greek camp.  Achilles' hatred for Agamemnon and vice versa depicts an interesting perspective on power and the symbiosis between characters that detest each other.  There are also several interesting comments such as Odysseus talking to Achilles: "War is young men dying and old men talking.  You know this.  Ignore the politics."  These comments offer much to reflect upon as the siege of Troy continues to kill husbands and fathers.<br /><br />Troy is depicted through radiant cinematography, which uses many vast shots where the background seems to go on forever.  The camerawork and lighting also offer several shots with silhouettes of the characters, especially of Achilles.  These silhouettes provide an interesting notion for the uncomplicated existence of Achilles as he perceives life rather black and white as he fearlessly moves through the battlefield with no thoughts of the death he is delivering to other.  The casts performances are, however, unbalanced and it affects the complete cinematic experience as it on occasion feels too 21st century, and in other scenes it is nothing but brilliant.  Altogether, Troy offers a solid cinematic experience, which provides the audience with several lessons and morals in regards to war and the aftermath of war.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FS9R0JXHLHEG.html">A1FS9R0JXHLHEG</a><br/><p>From the start, I think most of us knew that this was never going to be as great as 2000's epic, Gladiator, for two reasons - one, an epic like this had already been done (taking away its Hollywood originality) and two, its leading star, Brad Pitt, was never going to be good enough to give an Oscar winning performance. Although saying that, he portrayed the posing Achilles well, along with other good cast members such as Brendan Gleeson as Menelaus, Brian Cox playing the powerful Agamemnon and Eric Bana playing the well respected warrior and Prince, Hector.<p>With some tremendous battle scenes, entertaining sword fights and magnificent scenery (filmed in Malta), Troy does not fail to please the viewer. Based on Homer's historic poem 'The Iliad', this film follows many in their pursuits of victory, revenge, love and peace in a time of war. Perhaps not the most gripping or moving of films, you do at least have some care for the characters, yet I strongly believe with perhaps a stronger cast for certain roles, and a better script, Troy could have been one of the all time greats.<p>Yet despite this - Troy is a must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>...and Apollo would be quite angry at Wolfgang Petersen for directing such an appallingly bad adaptation of the Iliad. In addition to the bad acting, uninspiring battle scenes, and mediocre direction, the whole screenplay stands in such contrast to the Iliad or even the notion of a Greek epic that it's laughable.<br /><br />In the Iliad, most if not all the characters are tragic heroes and there aren't really any good or bad characters: all of the mortals succumb to the will of the Olympian gods. Although the film's removal of the immortal characters was not a bad idea, the dispositions of the mortals characters were changed so much that they follow neither the plot or theme of the Iliad. In the Iliad, Achilles worried about his fate and valor as a warrior but wasn't the type to sigh over those issues to every other character in the story: he did this primarily to his mother, Thetis the sea nymph. The Iliad also presents Helen as being beguiled or even abducted by Paris but she was never really Paris' willing lover. Another poor arrangement is Achilles' relation to Briseis. The movie actually combines Briseis (a girl captured by Achilles' men on an island raid and given to him as a token) with the character of Chryseis (daughter to Apollo's priest whom Agamemnon captured but returned only after he had unleahed Apollo's wrath on his army.) The film shows Achilles having intimate discussions with Briseis about the war, politics, etc. It's as if the film forgot that the story takes place in 1200 B.C. and not 20th century era of the emancipated woman. As the Iliad recites again and again, a woman's place was to tend to a man's bed, spindle her loom, and care for the household. Also given that Achilles was more fond of Patroclus than women, I don't think he would have cared one bit what his female captive thought with regards to anything other than obeying his commands.<br /><br />In terms of plot, the film leads the audience to believe that the siege of Troy was a picnic lasting only a few weeks instead of ten years. The film has both Agamemnon and Menelaus die before or during the sack of Troy which is completely at odds with the story: this was done simply to have Helen run off with Paris again in the end. The latter is the most stupid part of the film both in terms of plot and theme. Even in the film, Paris is the epidemy of cowardice and is anything but manly in battle: to have him live and run off with Helen into the sunset is to make the coward the hero. It's as if Dobbs in "Treasure of the Sierra Madre" kills everyone else and runs off with the gold. This type of plot structure is anti-climactic and undermines the entire thematic arrangement for an epic. An epic is a hero's tale, not a coward's: to make it otherwise isn't creative, it's just anti-climactic and simply idiotic.<br /><br />The battle scenes were uninspiring while the tactics and armaments were inaccurate. The phalanx was not a tactic used in the Iliad. The Iliad is quite descriptive in showing that the chariot dominated the battlefield while the infantry had a secondary role. The phalanx is a product of the citizen army of classical Greece, not the feudal armies of the Mycenean civilization. The funniest part is having Achilles' men use a Roman "testudo" or turtle formation that didn't come into existence until 1000 years later. The galleys shown in the film are also from the 5th century B.C. and not the 13th century B.C.: it would be the same as depicting Viking longboats of the 9th century as sailing vessels of the 18th century.<br /><br />In conclusion, this film is appalling in both concept and execution. I think it all starts witht he atrocious screenplay and Peterson's desperate efforts at directing this piece of trash into something watchable. I don't blame the actors too much for their lack of inspiration since they didn't have anything inspiring to work with in the first place. If you want to see this film because you never read the Iliad, don't bother: this film barely resembles the story. The plot is absurd and undermines the whole idea of an epic tale. Read the Iliad instead of watching this rubbish; it's more inspiring and Homer's battle descriptions are far more graphic than any of the action sequences in this pathetic film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>The Illiad gets Hollywood treatment and loses all poetry and awesomeness and what made it a classic of Western Civilization, not surprisingly. My main beef in addition to the theatrical release lacking any emotional depth or characters I cared about at all was that the story was stripped of its crucial mythological underpinnings. Where are the gods? Homer isn't meant to be real history. It'd be like if they did Lord of the Rings without magical wizards...instead Ian McKellen is an old hermit and there's no magical ring. They're just good northern European medieval people fighting an evil league of Roman Catholics, Turks, Middle Eastern peoples and Africans. Anyway. Yes they think Troy existed but that ain't the point of Homer and as far as realism goes (IF that's what they aimed for..) it didn't successfully flesh out ancient Greek life and war. I recall a scene of thousands of cgi spear carriers running across a field and feeling like you do when you're consciously watching a mundane "special effect", not something you feel real or compelling. Ex. of realistic type ancient battle is found here--> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FZJW7O">Braveheart Poster Movie 11x17 Mel Gibson Sophie Marceau Patrick McGoohan Catherine McCormack</a> and...here: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FJH4X2">Rome: The Complete First Season</a>. This Troy movie is a pedestrian sword and sandal battle flick. The battles weren't exciting except for a moment when poor Hector must face Achilles.. you had to feel bad for the guy. Achilles himself came across as almost neurotic and whinny but I still didn't care for him. And I think Pitt is a solid actor. My 2 cents. I'd recommend the amazing Rome: The Complete Series for godless, metaphysical free truly gritty realism. You're in the streets with the plebs smelling the body odor and gagging on the overpowering aroma of the sewage and rotting things and you could get shanked, beaten and robbed or worse... and you're also brought into Machiavellian soap opera intrigues of wicked aristocrats. Heck check out the original Clash of the Titans for some good but unabashedly campy Olympian adventure story fun - Laurence Olivier as Zeus!</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Throughout time, men have waged war. Some for power, some for glory, some for honor--and some for love. In ancient Greece, the passion of two of history's most legendary lovers--Paris, Prince of Troy and Helen, Queen of Sparta--ignites a war that will devastate a civilization. When Paris steals Helen away from her husband, King Menelaus, it is an insult that cannot be suffered. Troy is a stunningly movie, with an equally stunning cast. This movie takes your attention completely. Tremendously entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>My feelings on Troy are mixed.  While I did enjoy the action/war scenes that reminded me of Lord of the Rings, there was the small detail to the story and plot that just completely blew my mind.  Why, if you are going to make a history epic such as this, would you focus so intently on the characters that the story (which should have been the star of the film) pretty much falls to the wayside?  I think that it has something to do with who you have carrying your story.  If you have actors that are a little less defined in their careers, perhaps you would focus more on the story giving us the way that Homer would have been happy with.  Instead, we headline huge actors to carry the roles and focus more on the shirtless wonders of the world instead of the written word.  It is sad and unforgivable at the same time.<br /><br />To begin, let me tell you what I really liked about this film, which shouldn't take up too much space, but is still worthy of mention.  I loved the grand scale of this film.  When I read Homer's work, I didn't think of this tiny little incident that felt and looked like a back lot to a movie studio.  I wanted epic visions of land, wars, and chaos.  I wanted to be placed right in the action by being transported to the era visually and audibly.  Director Wolfgang Petersen did this with the greatest of ease.  This is a big production film, and he never allowed us to forget that.  Second, I enjoyed the smaller stories of this film.  The hints and references made to the culture at the time that allowed those three years of Latin class, Greek Mythology, and history of Troy seemed to constantly keep a grin on my face and my mind in motion.  It reminded me of Disney's Hercules, one of the most underappreciated Disney films out there.  There were subtle hints and clever moments that just placed that intelligent smile on your face.  Troy did the same even threw in a couple "fun" CGI moments for everyone to share, but sadly that was it.<br /><br />If you could turn the sound off on your television or surround sound and watch this film, you probably will experience a better picture than I did.  From the opening scene until the very anti-climactic moment in Troy, the hardest trouble that I had was the accents that accompanied our actors.  Brian Cox is one of the worst as I nearly found myself laughing in hysteria when he bellowed his first lines in a very un-Greek British accent.  This was followed by Orlando Bloom dawning a very unmasculine British accent coupled with Peter O'Toole looking very un-Trojan in his element.  If that wouldn't have been the tip of the ice cream, we were allowed to add sprinkles with the grunting force of Brad Pitt as our heroine/anti-heroine Achilles.  Taking moments from Rocky and Cobra, Pitt gives us his worst performance to date as a man given the strength of millions, but the emotions of a child.  It is sad to see Pitt butcher such an amazing character and never look back in suspicion.  This was not the role for him, and somebody (even the best boy) should have stepped out of his place to inform the Hollywood hitter that perhaps he was making a grave mistake.  Unfortunately, nobody came through and Troy was created and the power of Fight Club was thrown right out the window.  Corporate Hollywood had its field day in the Trojan sun.<br /><br />Another steaming issue that I had with this film was the pacing and timing of the overall picture.  Why did it take two hours to get to the most popular moment of the film?  Why did Petersen bog the viewers down with idle moments of passion and unnecessary character development when really we were most interested in learning about the infamous "Trojan Horse" and the "Achilles Heel" references?  I would hate to say it, but those were two of the reasons why I was very interested in seeing this film.  I wanted to see Petersen's portrayal of this historical moment, but instead what I discovered was that choppy editing left too much on the sandy desert floor.  It felt, at least to me, that the ending was very rushed and very underdeveloped.  The ending seemed cheaper to me, and without giving anything away, almost out of the precedent set forth by the beginning of the film.  I think Petersen knew that he had run out of time and the budget was already too big, so the ending was forced to suffer.  This ultimately hurt the film more than helped it giving it that sensation of a two-week science project done the night before.  I felt sorry for those involved with this droopy ending.<br /><br />To be honest, you had a very powerful story here that failed due to corporate Hollywood deciding to cast big names to fill the parts and place more emphasis on who was going to get the most screen time instead of story.  The actors hurt this film more than most will imagine because they just never fully represented the power of Homer's work.  I would have never imagined seeing Brad Pitt fighting along in Greek/Trojan times, and even after seeing this film I still cannot.  Brian Cox, normally fascinating in every film he does, just fell flat on his face in this film with the yelping of British words during this era.  It didn't fit causing the epic to quickly transform into nothing for that another summer blockbuster.  The story didn't help much either, forcing us to desperately want to get back into our High School Latin class to relive the truth of the story one last time.<br /><br />SEMPER UBI SUB UBI!!!<br /><br />Grade: *** out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>I had low expectations for the film, so I was very surprised I liked it as well as I did. Brad Pitt as Achilles was very good, which totally shocked me. I thought he would be miscast, but it worked. O'Toole was great. The other actors were hit and miss, but on the whole it worked. The fight scenes were very good. I read Ebert's review. I disagreed. I think 100,000 men would stop and watch Hector and Achilles fight.<br /><br />I've read the Illiad about ten years ago. The movie misses the irony of the gods and fates in the affairs of men angle, but the movie replaces that idea with the study of kingship, leadership and honor. Why do men follow a king into battle? Is there any good reason for war? Is love a good enough reason?<br /><br />The movie is overly long, overblown and too full of itself, but it works for me. The CGI creates armies of millions instead of armies of tens of thousands, but it is minor point. The sight from the upper rooms of the city of the 1000 ships arriving on shore is pretty cool. Within its genre, I think the movie holds up well.<br /><br />I had fun and that's all I ask from sandals and togas epic.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Hollywood seems to have forgotten how to make an effective epic. It took a talented guy from downunder (Peter Jackson "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy)to demonstrate that taking a risk can pay off big time. Wolfgang Petersen's epic "Troy" although flawed, captures the epic flavor of Homer's tale with strong performances, visual effects that are truly stunning in their recreation of ancient Greece and a literate script. While "Troy' isn't a perfect epic, it battles successfully against monumental expectations and comes away bloodied but still standing.<br /><br />Brad Pitt does a fine job as the proud and arrogant Achilles. I found no fault with his accent at all. After all, you have an international cast here with a variety of accents. When I last checked we were still pretty sure that the Greeks of the time didn't speak with English accents. Does it matter if his accent fits in? Not really as his performance more than makes up for that issue.  What matters here is whether or not the actor captured the flavor of the character. Pitt aquits himself quite well. Every bit his equal are Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom and veteran Brian Cox (the original Hannibal Lector). Sean Bean turns in an all too brief performance as Odysseus. The women characters do get short changed but that's not a surprise as this really focuses on the battles.  Peter O'Toole appears as King Priam and does a fine job in a limited role as well (although O'Toole hated working with Petersen so much he still hasn't seen the film). Diane Kruger turns heads as Helen of Troy. I've heard complaints about her performance and must say that she makes Helen a much more complex and real character than I thought possible.<br /><br />The script written by David Benioff isn't without its flaws. The film strays quite a bit from Homer's Iliad but when it does most of the time the changes work. Petersen's use of CGI expands the action rather than subtracting from it. In fact in one of the featurettes one of the CGI artists mentions that they had to convince Petersen to take some of the ships out the footage (compare the trailer to the finished product)as the way they were spread out it just wouldn't be believable.  While capturing the epic flavor of classic Hollywood films, the characters could have been a bit better developed than they were. Other than that, the dialogue provides witty entertainment particularly when Ageamemnon and Achilles trade barbed remarks.<br /><br />The disc looks exceptionally good with vivid colors and blacks darker than black coffee. The images sport exceptionally good clarity and sharpness. The anamorphic widescreen transfer looked like the better of the two particulary for a widescreen TV but both versions excel. The powerful battles for your attention with the intense visual sequences that Petersen has created.<br /><br />The extras include a number of very cool featurettes including "Troy: An Effects Odyssey", "Gallery of the God: A 3D animated guide to Greek myths and a really good featurette looking at the battle sequences. "From Ruins to Reality" also discusses the production design of the film and the challenges to recreating the past. This two disc set has both the feature film (spread over a dual layer single disc)with the special features located on the second disc of the film. There's no commentary track.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Wolfgang Petersen's "Troy" certainly was a spectacle in magnitude in the same vein as classic movies with ancient history themes like Ben Hur, The Robe and Spartacus.  The movie was visually stunning, however, it was far too long in duration and at times boring.  History purists will cringe at the liberties taken with Homer's "The Iliad". <p>The acting for the most part was adequate.  Veteran actor Peter O'Toole playing Trojan king Priam excelled and might walk off with a long overdue Oscar.  I had no problem with a buffed Brad Pitt as a pensive and brooding Achilles.  Eric Bana playing Hector gave a commendable performance.  Rose Byrne did well as Breisis and was more attractive than Diane Kruger, the gal who launched a thousand ships, Helen.  Brian Cox as Agamemnon was obnoxious but on second thought maybe he was meant to be.  Orlando Bloom, terrific in Pirates of the Caribbean was awful and miscast playing a wimpy Paris, prince of Troy.<p>Troy had potential to be much better but alas even with today's technical advances, they don't make movies like they used to.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>This movie based on Homer's Illid appears to be somewhat of a mismash. I think they took the book and stuck into a blender. What came out was a relatively basic war movie where computer armies fight it out and the script and the story were kept relatively simple. Of course, leave it to Hollywood to reduced a ten year siege into two months!!! Brad Pitts actually is the center of this movie, playing the ultimate warrior but he seem slightly miscast. I think much of the problem lies in the fact that there seem to be so little characterization in all characters, just your basic two-dimensional cardboard folks with only their base nature as a reference.<p>For the production values, I thought the city of Troy was superbly well done with computer graphics. The men of Troy was well costumed while the Greeks looked like they looted every Hollywood warehouses to get their outfits. Some looke like they were last used in the Passion of the Christ movie. I thought they did the Trojan Horse very well. It really did look like something made from scratch and that was very effective.<p>Diane Kruger plays Helen of Troy, the beauty that "launched a thousand ships" so to speak. There's a nice photo of her in the May issue of Premiere which suggest that she may be capable of launching a thousand ships after her.<p>Overall, entertaining but not very deep movie. I think the presence of Peter O'Toole helped somewhat but overall, it all about war and this have been done before and better in the Lord of the Ring movies for example.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Homer's "The Illiad" comes to life in this epic reenactment of the fall of Troy.  Banished are the Greek gods, who are referred to a lot, but never seen.  And that is probably for the best, although that is probably the most noticeable change from the source material.<p>Hector (Bana) and Paris (Bloom) from Troy are on a peaceful mission to Sparta, when Paris falls for the beautiful Helen (Kruger).  Paris takes her back to Troy, enraging her husband Menelaus.  Menelaus enlists the help of his brother, King Agamemnon (Cox), and his army to retrieve her.  Agamemnon sees this as a opportunity to increase his empire, and is more than willing to help, summoning his prized warrior Achilles (Pitt).  Achilles, we find out, will fight for Agamemnon, but only when it suits him.<p>The battle scenes are grand in detail and the special effects mesh seamlessly with the live actors, and one has come to expect in movies these days.  The problem lies more in the characters.  With the exception of Hector, the characters seem rather flat and unlikeable.  One could argue that Hector is the most noble character in the whole movie, and that is something that really gets him nowhere in the end.  All in all, "Troy" is enjoyable, but not as good as it could have been.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>I kept thinking--is this a movie or a Breck commercial? At least during the scenes with Achilles.  (Okay, and maybe the ones with Helen of Troy, that rarest of the rare--a strawberry blonde Greek with blue eyes to boot).  Pitt is so out of his element here, it's almost funny.  He looks like a male model at a monster truck rally. I especially liked how quickly he cleans up from one moment to the next, and not just from one scene to the next.  It's almost uncanny.  Brad, do more films like 12 Monkeys and Fight Club.  <p>Brian Cox is the standout, in terms of performances.  He plays a lovely old King, a greedy, bloodthirsty, and self-aggrandizing son-of-a-bitch who'd send 10,000 men to their doom just to get a little more power.  Cox gives him just enough growl, just enough macho, and just enough decay to pull it off.  And, speaking of decay, don't be surprised if Peter O'Toole makes the obituaries in this year.  He looks just about finished, and his performance looked like it was squeezed out of him.  (In one scene, with Pitt, O'Toole's eyes are half-focused, like he's not even seeing Pitt.  Sad, really.  I'm quite convinced it was no act.)<p>I gave this bombastic spectacle three stars simply because the battle scenes are nice, and the ultimate slugfest between Achilles and Hector was engaging.  I found myself shifting in my seat in response to the blows they traded.  Nicely done.  Hopefully, most know the story.  The ending is a bit of a downer, but I suppose it's nice that Hollywood didn't have a choice about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>"Troy" is woven from the same cloth as the mid 20th. Century bible epics such as "Spartagus" and "Quo Vadis." And whereas in those films we have the likes of Kirk Douglas, Richard Burton and Tony Curtis, in "Troy" we have Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger. And it is a toss-up who is more gorgeous and glamorous: Pitt, Bana, Bloom or Kruger. All four are beautifully photographed as to defy description especially since so much of this film is shot as set pieces, tableaux.<p>Wolfgang Petersen directs in such a stodgy and stoic manner that much of the good acting work is lost amidst the sand and sandals mise en scene. We had hoped for a "Fall of the Roman Empire," instead we got "Cleopatra."<br />Nonetheless, there are a few scenes of uncommon grace: Peter O'Toole (as Priam) begging for the body of his slain son of Achilles (Brad Pitt), Thetis (Julie Christie) pleading with her son (Achilles) to remain uninvolved with the inevitable conflict between the Trojans and the Greeks. But these moments are few and far between.<br /> Unfortunately, "Troy" is ultimately a lost opportunity to say something important about the world. What it is is a limp flaccid comment on the ancient past: more concerned with surface, rather than interior beauty.<br />"Troy" goes on way too long for its own good: it could have been cut by at least twenty minutes. But the main problem is one of focus and point-of-view. Yes, these are beautiful people involved with life changing experiences but why should we care? What is it about their experiences that we can embrace now, hundreds of years later? Director Wolfgang Petersen has taken the easy road: he's shown us the glitz and the glam but he's left out his point-of-view. Wolfgang: we need to know how and why we should care beyond why Brad Pitt has forbidden your showing his toes on camera. And unfortunately that's about all we can think about when we watch "Troy."</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>"May the gods keep the wolves in the hills and the women in our beds." Thus spoke Agamemnon at the start of this film, yet his words are strangely applicable to all men regardless of the age in which they were born. The same can be said of the epics of Homer. The working title of this film was The Illiad, but there are some major departures between the landmark of literature and the script from which the movie was made. Without the gods as characters, a great deal of the story loses its meaning. Furthermore, a "war, what is it good for?" angle has been introduced and instilled within the characters. In my humble opinion, such a stance concerning battles and death is strikingly misguided in relation to those who lived in the classical world. Sons and husbands dying was a daily occurrence, and many of the conversations in this movie are more reflective of twentieth century therapism than anything to do with the Greeks or Trojans.<br /><br />However, despite one's historical objections to the interjections made by the characters in the name of our times, Troy is a very entertaining movie. Its 2+ hours float by, and I can't recall a film that was so pretty. That sounds condescending but it isn't. Its colors are vivid, and the views engaging. It pleases regardless of how disjointed the narrative may be. As for Brad Pitt as Achilles, if you ask me, he is the best part of the movie. I know some people won't buy him in such a role, but I was quite impressed. He won his acting bona fides with me years ago in Kalifornia and stood out in Snatch as well. Additionally, I thought Sean Bean as Odysseus was outstanding.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR.html">A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR</a><br/><p>Troy should be the sort of movie that I love -- a lavish, sword-and-sandal epic. A real man's movie! Sadly, although there is a great deal to like about it, it's so solemn, pretentious, and impersonal that it fails to emotionally involve the audience with its characters. That said, if you love exciting, epic battle scenes, or summer blockbuster films, or even just seeing an unfairly handsome and buffed Brad Pitt, all sweaty and virtually nude, then read on . . .<br /><br />Film is a visual medium, and the original story is very, very long, so I can accept that many changes needed to be made. But in a bizarre move, all of the mythology of the original legend has been removed, and the story is rather presented as a historical epic, and not a mythological tale. I feel this was a great loss. I understand Director Wolfgang Petersen saw the gods as "silly and unnecessary to the plot". But when you consider the popularity of shows like Xena, I think audiences would be more accepting of mythology than Petersen gives them credit for.<br /><br />However, for me, the biggest problem with Troy is David Benioff's overly simplified screenplay: He manages to reduce a ten-year war to what appears to feel like just a week or so, he reduces Paris and Helen's romance to dopey teenage "I love yous", and a lot of the dialogue is empty rhetoric, with Achilles barking empty catch-phrases such as "Immortality! Take it! It's yours!". Indeed, the film is so solemn, pretentious, and impersonal that it fails to emotionally involve the audience with the characters. I recall seeing this film at the cinema and not really caring if any of the characters were killed. It's a pity that some of that $US200 million spent on the film couldn't have been spent on a script-doctor.<br /><br />The quality of Petersen's direction also varies. On one hand, he brings epic and complex action scenes with awesome set pieces to life with great precision. On the other hand, almost everything in Troy looks and feels fake. Many of the amazing sets and costumes, look like . . . well . . . amazing sets and costumes. Rather than looking like soldiers dragged into a brutal, soul-crushing, ten-year campaign, the men often look like they've just shown up that morning, and had some dirt or dust rubbed onto them. Their weapons don't look used, and the buildings don't look lived in.<br /><br />For me, apart from the stunning visuals and the beautifully fluid camera work, the most outstanding thing in Troy is Achilles' fight scenes. Over many months, Brad Pitt was trained by swordsman Steven Ho, and he swings his sword with a poetically elegant and deadly style.<br /><br />There is a lot to marvel at in Troy: The eye-popping visuals, seamless CGI-rendered grandeur, and the epic battle scenes, but if the same attention to detail had been applied to the rest of the film, as it has to Pitt's swordplay, Troy might have been a truly classic epic film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Troy is a very good movie that brings to life the director's version of how he would have liked Homer's story of the Trojan War to have been.  The movie does not faithfully follow the original, rather it is INSPIRED by Homer's Iliad, and therefore has a great deal of flaws and deviations from the original story. One could list one after another the discrepancies that occur, and for those that have read/studied the Iliad, you know the list would be very long indeed, some will say too long...  From this very long list the most important alteration of course was when Achilles enters the city of Troy, which he never actually did.  Even though this is Hollywood and one should be more flexible and lenient when dealing with adaptations, one should also keep in mind that this is the Iliad in question and not some modern twentieth century novel.  Therefore, the only real problem arises when the majority of people (and most people have NOT read the Iliad) who see the movie start believing that events happened the way the movie depicts/portrays and not the way they actually did occur according to Homer.  Consequently, due to the distortion of Homer's work, the movie poses a very serious danger of producing armies of misinformed people who think they know Homer when they really do not.  Not good!<br />Lastly, special emphasis must be made on the point that the Trojans are Greeks too, with the same language, the same gods, the same names etc, which is another thing that the movie does not stress enough, leaving relations between the combatants vague/open to any theory.<br />On the positive side, the movie is action packed, the special effects are great, the acting is very good and the cast are wonderful.  Peter O'Toole, Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, and the rest of the actors have done a superb job of providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.  Hopefully, more movies will be made set in the ancient times, as the demand for them is definitely there.<br />In short, it is my belief that the movie deserves 4 stars for the top quality and entertainment it provides, but falls short of 5 stars for deviating so much from the original and creating a sense of confusion among viewers.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>My wife's a "fan" of Brad Pitt (...), so it only made sense that I would inevitably see Troy.  She comes with me to see Kate Beckinsale fight vampires all the time, so I figure we're even.<p>It's easy to categorize Troy as a movie in the vein of the sweeping historical epics like Spartacus and The Ten Commandments.  The musical score swells, lots of extras mill about, and the camera moves slowly over panoramic views. Only in the 21st century, the musical score still swells, digitized extras using the Massive engine (first invented for Lord of the Rings) makes the extras mill about, and the camera moves slowly over computer-generated panoramic views.  For all intents and purposes, the effect is largely the same.<p>It's easier to categorize what Troy is not...<p>Troy is NOT Gladiator. Troy has far too many characters to focus exclusively on one man's revenge.  Unfortunately, Troy tries to do just that in the character of Achilles (Brad Pitt).  It doesn't work, if only because one has difficulty sympathizing with a killing machine.  Even if that killing machine walks around half-naked displaying his tanned washboard abs. Lots of men could empathize with The Spaniard.  There's very few folks to like in Troy.<p>Troy is NOT Helen of Troy.  There were plenty of flaws with Helen of Troy, not the least of which being that if you're going to use the premise that Helen's really worth launching a thousand ships for, she better be incredibly hot.  Helen of Troy's Helen simply didn't have that much allure.  Fortunately, the Helen of this movie (Diane Kruger) is very attractive.  On the other hand, her beauty is largely wasted because this is not about romance.  Where the Iliad played up the star-crossed lovers angle, this movie makes it clear (over and over and OVER) that the war is actually about much less noble aims.  In other words, Helen's just an excuse to start a war that would have happened anyway.  Which is sort of like saying that Moses just sort of made up the Ten Commandments.  I imagine Charlton Heston would have made a much less impressive movie as a result.<p>Troy is NOT Clash of the Titans.  Every mythical or supernatural trace has been eradicated from the script. Achilles isn't invulnerable ("why else would I use a shield?").  You won't see a bearded Zeus arguing with...well, anybody.  <p>Troy is a semi-realistic retelling of an event, with the presumption - one might say, arrogant assumption - that the Iliad is in fact an embellishment of the whole thing.  In transforming it into a simple if somewhat overblown war story, it has parallels to Americas' conflict with Iraq.  A powerful nation attacks a smaller country for construed reasons (Helen), only to find the protracted war to be more costly than expected. Indeed, there's even weapons of mass destruction - flaming balls of straw unleashed on slumbering Greeks.<p>Troy has its moments.  Achilles is a true martial artist and his combat is breathtaking.  Achilles himself is part of the scenery.  Brad Pitt, at 40-years-old, looks like he was sculpted from marble.  He FEELS like a hero of Greek myth.  Eric Bana's furrowed brow lends a tinge of regret to Hector.  And Orlando Bloom is suitably whiny and impetuous as Paris.  Heck, even Sean Bean plays the role of Odysseus, lending his measured tones to a man who has seen so much that he has his own string of movies. <p>Troy's strength is also its weakness.  The familiarity of the characters breeds contempt.  When Paris picks up a bow and fires arrows at Achilles and the hero continues to stump forward as arrow after arrow thuds into his chest, I couldn't help but flash back to Legolas (Orlando Bloom) firing a bow and Boromir (Sean Bean) stumbling to orc archery.  The Lord of the Rings trilogy has not even grown cold...either Troy has an eerily similar parallel or directors are already filming an homage to Peter Jackson. <p>And that's the problem.  Troy feels like a movie made by movie stars about some stuff that happened in the past.  Troy plays fast and loose with history and with the characters, but gives the actors plenty of time to enunciate and emote.  It is truly an actor's movie.  It also not a great movie, in the way Cleopatra isn't a great movie but people still watch it to see the stars.<p>For historical buffs, Troy is a revisionist travesty.  For moviegoers looking for an action flick, Troy's not exciting enough to hold their interest.  For fans of Greek mythology, Troy offers almost nothing at all.  Troy wants to be something entirely different...but nobody ASKED for that kind of movie.  It's almost as if the director felt the actual plot of the Iliad is too juvenile for modern audiences. Homer would disagree.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>Wolfgang Petersen's (Air Force One) adaptation of the classic poem by Homer is an excellent piece of work. True, a lot of liberties are taken, but WHAT ELSE CAM YOU EXPECT? David Bienhoff's AWESOME screenplay makes the story more dramatic than the poem was, the poem was just violence; but the script called for TONS of emotion from every actor and it worked like a charm. Diane Kruger (Helen) was perfectly cast as "The face that launched a thousand ships." Brad Pitt was terrific as Achilles, the greatest of the Greek warriors. Orlando Bloom ("The Lord Of The Rings" trilogy and "Pirates Of The Caribbean") was in top form as Paris, as were Eric Bana as Hector and the legendary Peter O'Toole as Priam. Julie Christie ("Dr. Zhivago" and Kenneth Branagh's 1996 adaptation of "Hamlet") did well in her one scene as Thetis, Achilles' mother. Sean Bean (the villainous Agent 006 in "Goldeneye", etc.) was good as Odysseus, hero of "The Odyssey". Brendan Gleeson ("M:I-2", "AI: Artificial Intelligence", etc.) and Brian Cox (the evil right wing militarist in "X-2: X-Men United", Disney's "The Rookie") were appropriately regal in their roles as Agammemnon and Menelaus. The actor who stood out, though, was Brad Pitt. His portrayal of Achilles gives the warrior a sense of humanity in his treatment of Briseus, Hector's lovely cousin. Compared to Mel Gibson's mega-hit "The Passion Of The Christ", this movie is almost bloodless, though there ARE gorier films than that one. Rated PG-13 for violence and some sensuality/brief nudity.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FNES0QEBJZD1.html">A1FNES0QEBJZD1</a><br/><p>The over 30 minutes of additional footage greatly enhance the theatrical release of this thoroughly interesting and exciting film.  One of Brad Pitts best films, and highly underrated, the video transfer is very good, sharp and detailed though out with no grain or video noise that I could detect.  The audio however, really could have used a more detailed mix into discreet channels as there is certainly enough action both in front and behind the viewer that a more thorough use of the rear channels would have been beneficial.  The additional footage is not just gratuitous cut scenes but actually do go further to enhance the story lines and create depth to the characters.  That the director himself states that this longer version is what he had initially envisioned adds to its validity.<br /><br />Though the story is not completely historically accurate according to the works of Homer, it never the less, is great watching.  You do get absorbed by the film and that is what entertainment is about.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of help and, if so, please check the 'Helpful' button so I know I am on the correct path with my reviews for you.

I think it is worth the buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A29E6IO3DZG6IY.html">A29E6IO3DZG6IY</a><br/><p>Superbly entertaining!  EPIC!  Characters and the intricacies of the ancient myths are well expressed.  Brad Pitt is AMAZING as Achilles.  Eric Bana is excellent as Hector, Diane Krueger is loveliness itself and Sir Peter O'Toole, while I thought him too 'white' for the part, is such a good actor that I forgot his paleness and was thoroughly taken in by his performance, as well as everyone elses, right down to the baby as Hector's son.<br />Everthing about this movie is SPLENDID and well researched too.  The costuming and sets are the closest to what would have been in that time period, inspiringly drawn and constructed, including an ingeniously designed Trojan horse.  The acting, screenwriting, cinematography, special effects, choreography, music, etc, are all excellent.<br />While the actual war lasted some 10 years (hence the thousand ships), it's considerably condensed for the purposes of movie making and some aspects of the story were changed, yet this movie is thoroughly engaging entertainment.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RH7ARWQSUVQV.html">A2RH7ARWQSUVQV</a><br/><p>In my opinion this is the best movie yet produced on what is, arguably, the greatest story ever told.  Granted, it is a Hollywood interpretation of the famous epic and is, therefore, inaccurate.  The screenwriters, however, clearly love Homer's tale and try to do justice to it.  They've just tried to tweak it a little.<br /><br />We see remorseless Agammemnon sacrifice his only daughter so that favorable winds will blow for the Greek fleet.  We see near-immortal Achilles playing with his women prior to deadly battle.  Actually this scene doesn't accord with the Iliad.  Achilles, who has been warned of his death at Troy, has dressed up like a woman and is hiding with them.<br /><br />We see Paris and Helen too weak to subdue their fatal desire.  We see Hector and old Priam--for reasons we never completely understand--refuse to discipline the wayward couple and return fair Helen to her husband.<br />We see the mechanical Achilles slaughter ranks of his enemies.<br /><br />Still, the story does diverge from the Iliad.  There is a duel between Helen's husband, Menelaus, and Paris.  Menelaus proves victorious but, when he goes to kill Paris, Hector intervenes and slays the cuckolded man.  Not true.  In the story Paris is whisked away to the arms of Helen by the Goddess Aphrodite.  Menelaus lives to reclaim his wife after the fall of the doomed city.<br /><br />The other, more fundamental change the scriptors made, was to minimize the supernatural component of the story.  Most of the events have natural explanations whereas, in the Iliad, events are dictated by bickering Gods.<br /><br />No matter.  Hector, both in the movie and in the Iliad, is sympathetic as the doomed hero fighting for his city.  He's a mighty warrior but he must fight against the Achilles demi-god.  He almost prevails but, in the end, there is no escaping death at Achilles' hand.  It is, after all, fate.<br /><br />I love the story so I liked the movie.  We are witness to events 3,200 years ago still we take sides and--even though we know what the outcome must be--we hope things will turn out differently.  It's remarkable in its own way.  Since the fall of Troy countless cities and civilizations have fallen but Homer's tragic tale makes us weep.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels--"Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God" on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U360OMVQRPUB.html">A1U360OMVQRPUB</a><br/><p>The blind poet Homer wrote down the lives of Achilles and Hector, the two bravest warriors to come out of the Trojan War.  They were men who knew honor and wanted a lot out of life.  Achilles wanted ever-lasting fame.  Hector wanted his family, his people, and his country kept safe.  Ultimately, these two men came to deathblows.  Hector's brother, Paris, kidnapped Helen, the wife of Menelaus, from the Greeks.  This provided all the excuse Agamemnon needed to crush the Trojans and add them to his list of conquered people.  The Greeks sailed to Troy to reclaim their lost queen, but the war lasted a long time and proved more costly than anyone would have believed.  But Achilles and Hector were at the eye of that storm.<br /><br />Brad Pitt stars as Achilles and does a good job in the physical and emotional sense of the character.  Eric Bana plays Hector, and comes across as a noble champion.  The film was directed by Wolfgang Petersen, a director noted for his attention to detail and willingness to get the scene no matter what it takes.<br /><br />TROY is a throwback to old Hollywood style filmmaking.  With a cast of thousands.  Of course, most of them are really computer animation, so the numbers are actually in the hundreds.  But the movie is just BIG.  The HD DVD version features beautiful imagery and Lossless sound that really makes you glad you bought the surround sound system.  The story is so big that even when it finishes two hours and forty-plus minutes later, you scarcely notice the time.  Something is always going on.  Some character is always in trouble (or dying or grieving).<br /><br />I was familiar with the story from high school as well as college, but the two characters never touched me so much before.  Maybe it's because I'm older and realize now how much was truly at stake and how different things might have been.  But I choose to believe it's because the story was present so well, visually as well as emotionally.  The suspense was great, because you could see how fate would intervene again and again until there was no choice but for Hector and Achilles to fight, one man against the other.  TROY is a great addition to the home library whether you're a fan of one of the actors or big period movies.  Get it or rent it and you're in for a treat.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z28WKY1LHBKY.html">A2Z28WKY1LHBKY</a><br/><p>After watching this highly superior epic four times in succession I attempted to revise and edit my first review, upwards, but Amazon wasn't having it; so I scrapped it, and now start again.<br /><br />To anyone familiar with Homeric legend there is much that is disconcerting about  this telling of the story, which is different from the Iliad, although using numerous characters and incidents from the ancient Greek original --- not that the Iliad itself was original in the sense one might assume. These stories had been told and re-told, each bard adding and omitting to suit his audience and his own temperament. There seems nothing wrong, therefore, for a modern team of writer and film director to do their own thing, especially as they have deliberately changed the title of their tale, making it quite clear that they are not aiming to reproduce the classic Iliad. Any criticism which complains that Benioff and Petersen don't precisely follow Homer (if he ever existed) is  barking up the wrong tree.<br /><br />This is a stunning, intriguing and fascinating movie in its own right. At first one may be taken aback, for other reasons besides its deviation from its inspiration. The dialogue is curiously throwaway and informal, to anyone brought up on the sententiously stilted posturing and declaiming of traditional celluloid epics.  A number of reviewers are annoyed by what they regard as the inaccuracies and  anachronisms of social life, battle techniques, armour, equipment and so forth. The fact is that no one is quite sure when, if ever, the famous siege of Troy took place --- and there is even some doubt as to where.  All that is certain is that it was in the past; a long, long, time ago. This aspect is conveyed with tremendous effect. At the same time, the actions, motivations, behaviour and psychology of the individuals is bang up-to-date, and extremely convincing. The political power-play, the arrogant insubordination of Achilles, the dependency and resentful hatred of the boss, ring true. Achilles' petulance is a strong and crucial feature of the familiar version. Brad Pitt's performance, and ability to convey his utter superiority as a killing machine on the battle-field, is exceptional. The fact is that the Iliad itself centres on Achilles; his grimly fatalistic attitude, and his acceptance of a short, spectacular life instead of unmemorable longevity.<br /><br />The absence of the Gods is complained of.  I didn't feel this in any way at all. The Gods are present in this movie, just as much as they are in Homer. No contemporary actually imagined that Aphrodite, Ares, Apollo and the rest appeared on the battlefield. They were conscious, however, of how little men could do to take charge of their own destinies. The hidden presence of the Gods was finely suggested: these ancient humans are presented as if in the grip of outside forces. They are doomed by fate to act out their given roles, which the Gods have decided for them. Freedom and choice were illusory. They still are --- although we are obliged to believe that we are in control of our own lives.<br /><br />Some reviewers have criticized the performances of Paris and Helen. I don't get it. The actress is beautiful, and that is all she has to be. She is merely the face that launched the thousand ships: the excuse for the war, not the real reason. Her changing expressions as she enters Troy for the first time speak volumes. Paris is a feckless playboy, a lover not a fighter, but a good archer.<br /><br />This film is stuffed with mind-expanding ideas, superb performances, spectacular action and scenery. The computer graphics are inevitable, these days, but they do conjure up powerful images. This is certainly one of the best epics I have seen --- perhaps the very best; and I'm astonished by the number of negative reviews.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>Troy, like Gladiator, is relatively painless to sit through, but most likely you won't want to watch it again.  Hollywood's big budget adaptation of The Illiad conveniently came out at a time when this kind of film is at it's high.  Parts of the book are randomly tossed out to keep the action going and the target audience happy.  Characters speak in a modernized English which is annoying.  In order to guarantee box office success, a big name actor is put in the starring role, even though they're not right for the part.  In this case Brad Pitt as Achilles.  I don't really have anything against Pitt, but he's no Achilles no matter what reviewers here might say.  Obviously they never read the book. How many of you have read The Illiad and thought to yourself, "Boy, wouldn't Brad Pitt make a great Achilles?"  Probably none of you.  If memory serves, Achilles is described as seven feet tall and four feet wide.  Not very Brad Pitt-like.  Personally I think Dolph Lundgren would make a pretty cool Achilles. That would never happen though coz he's not pretty or popular enough, though he'd do a better job.  Peter O'Toole is good as usual, so is Brian Cox.  Eric Bana is a decent Hector and Orlando Bloom has finally found a role that suits his talents-a whiney wuss.  For once CGI is used to good effect, making the battle scenes impressive.  All in all not a bad film, there is much worse out there.  Makes a great double feature with Caligula, but then again any film does.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I'm glad I didn't go out and buy this DVD, as I don't think I was too impressed with it. So I'd highly recommend to buy only if you're interested in this kind of movie - rent otherwise, or borrow from a friend.<br /><br />I'm not the biggest fan of Brad Pitt or Orlando Bloom - I prefer my guys who are a bit rough around the edges, whereas these two are a bit too pretty for my liking. I know, I must be the only girl in the world who doesn't fantasise about Brad Pitt. With all the publicity though, I'm definitely looking forward to Mr & Mrs Smith!<br /><br />What I found most annoying about this movie, and many other movies similar to it, is how they're all trying to be the next Lord Of The Rings (according to my Dad, as I still haven't seen those movies, and at the moment, have no wish to). Also, was it just me, or were the main stars constantly posing?! It got on my nerves after a while!<br /><br />I think I'd probably heard of Troy, Achilles & the Iliad through school, although I can't remember reading it. The whole Achilles myth/legend was very familiar to me - where he can be killed through his heel, after his mum dipped him in something, but held him by his heel.<br /><br />This is a butt-numbing 156 minutes long, and could have easily been shortened, and made it pass quicker. The battle scenes are very cliched, and we've seen them a zillion times before. You don't know which army you want to win - with Braveheart (for example), you knew you wanted the Scots to win. With this, it's very confusing. Look out for Brian Cox (he's in everything!) and James Cosmo (?), who was in Braveheart also. You felt no sympathy for any of the characters - although I must admit Hector (Eric Bana) made me very sad towards the end. (Without ruining it for anyone!) You know something's wrong with the film, when you're laughing at the death scenes, and making up things that the cast are saying (BOO!) as they're lying on the funeral pyre. However, I did love the funeral scenes, especially with the focus on the coins on the eyes, to pay the ferryman - this was a terrific tradition.<br /><br />This film can be liked or hated. With the severe lack of decent eye candy, instead of posing pretty boys, I'm sitting on the fence with this film. It's too long (although I can sit through Titanic perfectly), and it doesn't hold your attention for long enough. I was always looking for an excuse to pause it. It's definitely not something I'd ever watch again. Once is enough!</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>My wife and I saw TROY on the big screen with good friends, a highly educated MD and his wife.  The good doctor walked out in a huff after only an hour because he felt Homer's "Iliad" was being "desecrated by Hollywood."  We three stayed and enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />And I like the DVD even more.<br /><br />Wolfgang Peterson fully captures the grand scale of events that engage Greek warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt), Trojan Prince Hector (Eric Bana) lovers Paris (Orlando Bloom) and Helen (Diane Kruger) in a war that launched a thousand ships to recover a pretty face.<br /><br />Admittedly, it's a little jarring accepting Pitt as Achilles. He's oiled up, precisely coiffed and often photographed in golden light like a pin up.  But he's very fine in the action scenes and choreographed battles -- especially the final duel with hector. And Pitt gives it his all and almost holds his own in an emotionally pivotal scene with Peter O'Toole.  Eric Bana is a much more forceful presence than Pitt but it's O'Toole who steals every scene he's in as Troy's King Priam.<br /><br />Surprisingly, there's no commentary from Peterson and stars Pitts and Bana. It wouldn't surprise me if there's a "special colelctor's edition" DVD coming out next year. I hope it includes something -- anything at all, really -- from Peter O'Toole and Julie Christie.<br /><br />Limited extras do include: "In The Thick of Battle," a fine featurette on the battle sequences and the training of warrior extras. "From Ruins to Reality" explores how the remains of ancient Troy were unearthed and how the production designers created their own version of the legendary city.  "Troy: An Effects Odyssey" looks at some of the stunning visual effects and the creation of the effective sound design.  There's also a 3-D tour of Mount Olympus in the "Gallery of the Gods" where we meet the fabled Greek Gods that play an important part in Homer's poem but are missing (thankfully) from the movie.  There's a brief, informative monologue that goes with each semi animated god or goddess.<br /><br />Even with mixed reviews, "Troy" grossed over $491 million worldwide.  Not too bad.  The audience doesn't lie.<br /><br />And I bet Homer would approve of his 3,200 year old poem being part of our pop culture.  I say it's great to see the "Iliad" as a glorious cinematic extravaganza (even without the gods).<br /><br />The transfer and sound are stunning.<br /><br />If you like widescreen epics, you will enjoy Troy on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VE83MZF98ITY.html">A2VE83MZF98ITY</a><br/><p>There are several problems with the film 'Troy', if one is trying to fit it too closely with the literature which inspired it, Homer's Illiad. There are too many deviations from the ancient Greek epic poem for this to be other than 'inspired by' - there are characters missing (Cassandra, etc.); there are characters whose fates are different from the Illiad (I won't give spoilers, so you'll have to trust me), and the overall situation is cast in a very different light.<br /><br />In the film, Achilles (Brad Pitt, looking more bulky than usual) is the greatest warrior alive, with a reputation unparalleled in the world. However, he is a loose canon of sorts, as likely to kill his own leaders as the enemy. Achilles is tempted to the battle with Troy, portrayed as one of the greatest battles in history, by the call of everlasting glory. Achilles is persuaded in the end by no less an ironic character than his own mother, who recounts to him the prophecy of an idyllic life at home should he stay, but then to be forgotten after he dies, or the chance at immortality in legend, despite the fact that he'll die at Troy. Achilles sets sail.<br /><br />The war with Troy is portrayed as having been going on for a decade; at a peace meeting in Sparta, Paris (younger prince of Troy, Orlando Bloom) falls in love with the fair 'was this the face that launched a thousand ships' Helen, wife Sparta's king, Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson). Helen steals away with Paris on the ship returning to Troy; Hector, the elder prince and heir to the throne (Eric Bana) is conflicted as to what to do, but opts to journey on to Troy, and the die is cast.<br /><br />Agamemnon (Brian Cox) uses the event as a chance to band all the Greek city-states together into a final battle with Troy, the greatest rival to his power in the Aegean (and the centre of much of the civilization of the world at that time). This is where the retelling becomes much more modern than ancient. The Illiad is not so concerned with economics and hegemonies as it is with ethics and honour - Agamemnon is portrayed as a Realpolitick power-seeker of the first order, willing to stop at nothing to decimate allies and foes alike for his own power, willing to use honourable pretenses to achieve dishonourable ends. Does one sense a thinly-veiled critique of the modern siege-makers in this?<br /><br />An astonishing armada is amassed and sets sail for the coasts of Troy. Once there, the beachhead is taken, and the first major act is a desecration of the temple of Apollo (a dishonouring of the local gods - again, does one sense a critique of the moderns here?) by Achilles, who nonetheless proves himself the most valuable warrior the Greeks have. At this point, the internal strife becomes as problematic for the Greeks as the front lines, as Achilles disregards the commands of Agamemnon and cares little for the political outcomes of the war.<br /><br />The intrigues and the plotting of the Greek leaders are cast in high relief against the more pastoral leadership of `good king' Priam (portrayed by Peter O'Toole with his characteristic panache). Hector is a strong and wise leader under his father; Paris is the foolish and rather cowardly one. (We are missing the back-story of the Illiad of how Paris came to be part of Troy's royal family, and it is assumed that there is no unusual story there.) We rather lose sight of the fact that, indeed, Paris stole the queen of Sparta (again, the modern idea creeps in - in our day, a woman would have the right to choose where she wished to live, but not so in the ancient world; one might question whether the queen of a nation has the right to abandon her role and 'shack-up' with the neighbouring prince at will, but I digress...).<br /><br />The people of Troy are seen as virtuous despite the fact that they are defending the less-defensible position morally. The Greeks might have right on their side in some respects, but this is lost in their brutality and by the unbridled greed of their leaders, and of course it is the ordinary foot-soldiers, including Achilles, who have to do the fighting and dying for the cause, as their princes exchange gifts of gold, money and priceless art treasures to congratulate themselves on their victories.<br /><br />The film portrays the battle lasting only a matter of a few weeks; the brutality of the battle scenes is as dramatic as any in modern war films, just as bloody. The single-combat scenes between Achilles and Hector, Hector and Patroclus, and others are extremely well choreographed, introducing various techniques I've not seen before in sword-play films.<br /><br />I don't think it is a spoiler to give away the major ending here, in that Troy eventually falls, not to military might, but to trickery. The Greek ships have sailed, leaving only an offering to Poseidon behind - a giant horse. The Trojan Horse (if the Greeks built it, why is it always called `the Trojan Horse?') is carted into the city whose walls cannot be breeched, and the people celebrate their victory. As they rest after the revelry, Greek soldier inside the horse emerge (including in this telling, Achilles), open the gates to the city, and the Greek army swarms in.<br /><br />A nice touch to the film is the hand-off of the great sword of Troy to a young man named Aeneas, with the instruction that so long as a Trojan has the sword, Troy will live on (this connects to the Roman epic poem, the Aeneid, which tells of Aeneas' journey from Troy to Rome, making them the spiritual successors of Troy, particularly meaningful when the Romans then conquer the Greeks).<br /><br />The effects are great, as is the general cinematography. This is a film to be seen in the theatres, for the 'big screen' effect.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>Troy is a movie worth watching. Eric Bana does a great job on playing Hector, Prince of Troy. Hector is showed as a kind and decent man that loves his family and country. And with his performance, you will believe it. Peter O'Toole was a natural choice for playing Priam, King of Troy. The movie is centered around Achilles, Brad pits character. And he plays him well for the way the movie is written. He is shown as a self-centered man that fights for his own reasons, and does not care for the fate of Greace or their kings. What is important to Achilles, is that his name go down in history as great.<br /><br />Pitt obviously did a lot of work to get in shape and learn the great choreography of the fights. Achilles fight scene with Hector is the real star of this movie. It is a very exciting fight, starting with his moving stride across the sand as he starts the attack. Pitt does makes us feel that Achillies is the greatest warrior on that battlefield.<br /><br />Priam had negotiated a peace between Troy and Sparta's King Menelaus, played by Brendan Gleeson. But this peace is broken when Paris, played by Orlando Bloom, convinces Helen, played by Diane Kruger, to run away with him to Troy. The movie shows that Priam and Hector know that what Paris did was wrong, and yet they will risk the safety of Troy to keep Helen.<br /><br />Seeing the large Greek army array itself before Troy is impressive. And the large battle scenes are exciting. Espcially when they try to show some of the manuevers in close ups. The rest seems to just be computer animation for the large scenes. Extras must cost too mch no a days. But still fun to watch.<br /><br />The film is not true to the epic poem. But then, what movie is true to the written medium. You can not show all the true dynamics of the poem. After all the war lasted ten years. And the fact tha tthe real reason for the Greek alliance was not political as the movie shows, but it was rather a part of an oath sworn by all the princes who were suitors for Helen. And the film does take liberty not only with when certin people died during the war, like Achilles himself, but as to who even actually died. Forgetting all that, I loved this move for entertainment, but not as a history lesson.</p></br><a href="../users/A281NPSIMI1C2R.html">A281NPSIMI1C2R</a><br/><p>Too many men have died today! If killing is your only talent, that's your curse. I don't want anyone dying for me. ~Briseis<br /><br />If you have yet to view the greatest war story of all time, I would highly recommend listening to Robert Fagles translation on audio cassette. While it takes 9 hours to listen to the story, your viewing experience of this movie will be greatly enhanced. The original story seems to imply that the cause of the war is more of a game between the gods on Olympus. The participation of the gods is hinted at throughout the movie and in the "Gallery of God" extra feature, but never truly explored. Did Aphrodite offer Paris the love of Helen? Who was actually plotting the destruction of Troy? Is the war simply a game between the gods?<br /><br />With this in mind, it is no wonder that the love between Paris and Helen pales in comparison to all the other themes of love in this movie. It is sweet and romantic, but we never learn enough about either character to become emotionally attached. The love story between Briseis and Achilles seems much more compelling, as is the love between Hector and his wife.<br /><br />There are three main love stories between the main male characters and their chosen women. Then, there is the love of a brother, the love of power, the love of peace, the love of a king for his son and the love men have for their country. This movie is filled with love as the underlying force motivating the actions of men. Most of the women endure great emotional suffering and Helen is presented as a woman who wants to make the right choice, but can't seem to break free from Paris.<br /><br />When I listened to the Iliad on tape, I considered how violent this would be when it was made into a movie. The brutality in the story tends to explode in a similar way to how the fight scenes appear onscreen. The savage energy becomes very primal and yet the brutality is somehow soothed by the use of special effects. At times the movie relapses into a wrestle mania mode for comic relief, but overall this is a very serious movie complete with realistic action and impressive fireballs hurtling across sand dunes. I loved the excitement of the impending doom produced by horses galloping on the sand and the contrast of the war against the peaceful azure sky and sea.<br /><br />Throughout the movie we are presented with two perspectives and frankly we grow to love characters on both sides of this war. As Achilles calls for his men to fight for immortality, Hector appeals to his men to fight for Troy, "mother to us all."<br /><br />The brutal war scenes with magnificent swords and armor seem to take up most of the movie, although there are a few moments of romance. While women are viewed as prizes of war, Achilles actually fights for Briseis and seems to have genuine affection for her. Brad Pitt's fight scenes are quite enjoyable to watch from a "superhero" perspective. The way he fights is unique and therefore quite fascinating. After watching many of his movies, I can't think of anyone more perfect to play Achilles. He has the ability to alternate between extreme violence and tenderness. In this man, a lover resides. It does seem that at times he would rather be a lover than a fighter because he wants to return home. His confrontation with King Priam was well worth waiting for and is quite profound when you truly consider the moment of understanding between enemies.<br /><br />Peter O'Toole (Trojan King Priam) steals the movie with his amazing facial expressions. His look of desperation as he prays in the temple and his look of absolute terror when Hector and Achilles fight is stunning in its emotional impact. These seem to be the pivotal points in the movie and his acting helps to set the mood and add stability to the instability of war.<br /><br />I must say that while I prefer the travels in the Odyssey to a war, it is the heart of the Iliad and the romance in the movie version that fully captured my attention. We are only left wondering about the cost of love and a little worried that maybe the gods were having a bit too much fun while this movie was being made. The special features are very revealing and it is amazing they finished this movie.<br /><br />As someone who doesn't appreciate war movies, I was highly impressed with TROY and watched it twice in 24 hours. The themes reverberate down through the ages and this adaptation makes Homer's Iliad very palatable for today's audience. I had very low expectations and now I wish I had seen this sooner. Even if this is not a perfect version, I enjoy variety in a story and it is more a change in perspective than a complete reordering of the underlying elements. I think they could have made this movie even more enjoyable with less war scenes and a little more intrigue and humor, especially involving the gods. Although it did keep my attention for almost 3 hours, twice.<br /><br />The true irony in this movie is that when Paris finally makes a good judgment call; no one listens to him. Also...what makes "this" Helen worth dying for? I'd love to know more about her character and why Paris fell in love with Helen in the first place. The plot is fairly simple and if you crave complete accuracy and complexity, I'd recommend listening to the audio version or reading a translation.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>As a teacher of Classical Greek and Roman Mythology I was looking forward to "Troy."  In the past I have put together a unit on the Trojan War that included not only Homer's epic poem the "Iliad," but also the plays of Euripides and Aeschylus and other ancient works on the stories of these characters. In other words I am familiar with this story to the extent that when Briseis showed up wearing a garment with long sleeves I was upset that we did not get to see the lovely arms that were part  of her usual epithet. So, suffice it to say, that when characters who survived the Trojan War started dying in this film, I was not exactly happy. Consequently, the truth is that the less you know about the Trojan War of classical mythology, the more you will enjoy Wolfgang Petersen's "Troy."<br /><br />I have no problem with the idea that Homer and the other ancients have to be adapted in making a modern motion picture about the Trojan War. The decision to eliminate the gods is appropriate, getting away from the idea that this was a ten year war makes sense, and if the alliance of the Greeks is now political rather than as part of an oath sworn by the princes who were suitors for Helen's hand, I consider that to be legitimate. I do not understand why Iphigenia, Cassandra, and Hecuba are all eliminated but there are not fatal omissions. But when you start rewriting who gets killed that is going a bit too far, especially when one premature death starts a chain effect that means Athens will never develop the jury system, which means we probably lose out on it too. David Benioff's screenplay was "inspired" by Homer's "Iliad," which at least is an honest way to characterize what he did in this script, but I still do not have to like it or endorse it.<br /><br />The big selling point for this film was not Homer but rather Brad Pitt as Achilles. Stories abound about how Pitt worked six months to get in shape for this film, gave up smoking, and ended up hurting his Achilles tendon in one of those profound ironies that indicates that maybe the gods were not pleased with what was happening in this film. Pitt certainly looks good, not just in terms of taking several opportunities to display the line of his nude body, but in how he carries himself as Achilles. The whole idea is that this guy is the greatest warrior on the face of the planet and Pitt exudes that with the way he strides across the sands of Troy. Even more impressive is the choreography for the fights, because Pitt's movements are so smooth and powerful, especially compared with that of Eric Bana's Hector, that you do not doubt that this guy is in a league by himself as a warrior. I also like the way he uses the distinctive form of his shield when fighting.  They thought this part out quite a bit.<br /><br />The fight choreography was worked out by Simon Crane, the film's stunt coordinator and second unit director, who describes Achilles as fighting with a boxing style but with the velocity of a speed skater and the agility of a panther. They also come up with a nice touch in that Achilles looks slightly to the side at his opponent until he is ready to come in for the kill. The best fight sequences of "Troy" are when Achilles is fighting. The giant battle sequences of computerized soldiers are not as impressive, mainly because the camera is always in motion and the cutting is so fast that we are left with an impression of the battle rather than always being able to tell what is going on (which has become my constant complaint with most movies with large battle sequences).<br /><br />Bana does a good job of capturing Hector's nobility without turning him into a marble statue, while Peter O'Toole fills the role of Priam naturally. On the Trojan side the problematic character is Paris (Orlando Bloom), again because of the writing more than the performance. Priam has negotiated peace between Troy and the Sparta of King Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), but that is destroyed when Paris persuades Helen (Diane Kruger) to run away with him. Both Hector and Priam know that Paris is wrong and their reasons for supporting him and thereby dooming Troy ring hollow (the less than stellar "Helen of Troy" television miniseries did a nice job of providing a solid motivation for the Trojans to protect Helen).<br /><br />It you want to draw a clear distinction between Homer's story of Achilles and that of Benioff it is that the former is about the rage of Achilles (see the first line of the "Iliad") and the latter adds an equally strong love element. The one character whose role is most inflated in this version is that of Briseis (Rose Byrne), the Trojan slave girl who comes between Achilles and Agamemnon (Brian Cox), the king of kings for the Greeks. This change becomes the reasoning behind how the film rewrites the end game of the Trojan War, although I still do not understand why some of the key characters get to live happily ever after. But since Pitt's performance dominates the film and he is clearly the horse that director Wolfgang Petersen is riding to make the whole thing work, it makes sense that he has to be around until the very end.<br /><br />The good news is that when I teach mythology after this DVD comes out my students will probably enjoy attacking Benioff's changes in the original stories of Greek mythology in their papers. I think this will definitely help them understand why the writings of Homer and the other ancients are considered classics.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UUP58XPQW3GF.html">A2UUP58XPQW3GF</a><br/><p>When I saw TROY in the theaters, I wasn't expecting much. After that first viewing, I knew there was something missing; the screenplay just didn't grab me, it failed to immerse me on the scenes. I am quite familiar with GREEK myths, also both Norse and Roman mythology. Well, I managed to purchase the director's cut of Troy, and although it is not as great as KINGDOM of HEAVEN Director's cut, it is a better cut of the film.<br /><br />I presume that most of the folks who'll be interested in the director's cut are fans or at least the ones who saw it in theaters as I did. ONE OBVIOUS improvement this version has over the previous dvd is the PICTURE transfer. The Video this time out is more vibrant, sharper and cleaner. Another difference is the SOUNDTRACK on certain scenes; the training scene of Achilles and his cousin, the duel between Hector and Achilles. Also, the music is improved with added bass during the siege at the beach and on the gates of Troy. The music sounded more powerful.<br /><br />The Director's cut has the same plotlines, characters and scenes. It does have added "meat" and do they make Troy a better cut of the film? Yes.<br /><br />1: Opening scene with a dog going around the spoils of war. (Dead bodies)<br />2: Nudity in the scene between Paris and Helen. Their relationship is also a bit more fleshed out. Love scenes are extended, suffice it to say, the film is a bit more uninhibited when it comes to nudity.<br />3: Helen's husband is shown as unfaithful. It gives more motivation to Helen's actions.<br />4: Odysseus is developed as the humble King of Ithaca. He likes to be among the common folk.  His character is also more fleshed out; the film also emphasizes how it is Achilles trusts his judgment.<br />5: Hector knew about Paris' affair with Helen even before they boarded the ship back to Troy. He warns him of the potential consequences.<br />6: Achilles' ego is more fleshed out.  He has a confrontation with Agamemnon regarding the Priestess of Apollo. (Extended)<br />7: Extended battle sequences. More blood is shown. Heads get lopped off more often.<br />8: Funeral sequences are extended. It shows more emotion and emphasizes the combatants' sorrow with the lost of their comrades.<br />9: A dog licks off the "fake" disease after the Trojans took the wooden horse inside their city.<br />10: Agamemnon's obsession and arrogance is more fleshed out.<br />11: Extended final act sequence; last assault on the city of Troy. More blood and gore is shown. A tad more brutally graphic.<br /><br />There may be more that I missed, it did contain an added 30+ minutes of footage. The film is contained in 2 discs (2 Dual layer DVDs) similar to the terrific extended cuts of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and Kingdom of Heaven Director's cut.<br /><br />VIDEO/AUDIO: 2.35 Anamorphic widescreen. Exceptional transfer, an improvement over the previous dvd release; Near-flawless picture quality, nice colors, improved sharpness and contrast. Black levels are solid. 5.1 Dolby Digital English is very powerful. I'd had hoped that this cut would include DTS sound mix, it would have been better with DTS.<br /><br />In closing: Is the director's cut worth a "double dip"? For me, for $ 14.99 2-disc edition director's cut, definitely yes! As for the other more "stylish" Ultimate Edition (includes photo book etc.)with the $ 25.99-$ 34.99 price tag, I'm not so sure. For fans of the film, or if you don't have the original release, this is a no-brainer. The lack of DTS track is a minus, but this new edition definitely has a bit more "grandeur" than the theatrical release.<br />However, if you hated the original cut, this new director's cut will NOT change your mind!<br />Recommended!

We as viewers (well, most of us) cut Peter Jackson some slack with his deviations from Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings," and we ought to give the same consideration to Wolfgang Petersen, who brings Homer's classic to vivid, sweaty life.  And not only does Petersen pull off a cinematic coup, he makes watching TROY an outright fun and thrilling experience.<p>The film centers around two characters--and they are not Helen and Paris.  A beefed-up Brad Pitt plays Achilles, a fierce Greek warrior who is literally unbeatable.  Yet Achilles is anything but a nice person:  he is self-centered and pretentious, and he fights on his terms, often to the detriment of his countrymen.  Achilles has but one quest:  to be immortalized through history, and the Greek siege of Troy provides him the perfect opportunity.  For such a shallow, narcissistic character, Pitt is perfectly suited for the role.<p>Eric Bana, on the other hand, steals the show as Hector, Prince of Troy. Hector is a good, kind, and decent man who loves his family and his country.  Faced with having to clean up the mess after his brother Paris (Orlando Bloom) brings Helen of Sparta (Diane Kruger) to his beloved land, Hector leads the Trojan army against the Greek invaders; his showdown with Achilles is inevitable, and is also the film's defining moment.<p>Yet TROY is bursting at its wooden horse seams with other memorable performances, including a frail Peter O'Toole as Trojan King Priam, and his scene-chewing counterpart Brian Cox, who plays greedy King Agamemnon.  Brendan Gleeson and Sean Bean are superb, too, as Greek kings Menelaus and Odysseus, while Bloom is less than stellar as a peach-fuzzed, pusillanimitic Paris.<p>Director Petersen delivers a grand epic complete with stunning cinematography, fierce action, imaginative special effects, and a spellbinding story.  His film does not detract, but instead enhances, Homer's classic.  In the words of King Menelaus of Sparta:  "May the gods keep the wolves in the hills and the women in our beds."  How can an epic go wrong with a line like that?<br />--D. Mikels</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>...and Apollo would be quite angry at Wolfgang Petersen for directing such an appallingly bad adaptation of the Iliad.  In addition to the bad acting, uninspiring battle scenes, and mediocre direction, the whole screenplay stands in such contrast to the Iliad or even the notion of a Greek epic that it's laughable.<br /><br />In the Iliad, most if not all the characters are tragic heroes and there aren't really any good or bad characters: all of the mortals succumb to the will of the Olympian gods.  Although the film's removal of the immortal characters was not a bad idea, the dispositions of the mortals characters were changed so much that they follow neither the plot or theme of the Iliad.  In the Iliad, Achilles worried about his fate and valor as a warrior but wasn't the type to recite that fact over and over again to every other character in the story.  Helen was beguiled by Paris and kidnapped back to Troy; she was never Paris' willing lover. Another poor arrangement is Achilles' relation to Briseis.  The movie actually combines Briseis (a girl captured by Achilles' men on an island raid and given to him as a token) with the character of Chryseis (daughter to Apollo's priest whom Agamemnon captured but returned only after he had unleahed Apollo's wrath on his army.)  The film shows Achilles having intimate discussions with Briseis about the war, politics, etc.  It's as if the film forgot that the story takes place in 1200 B.C. and not 20th century era of the emancipated woman.  As the Iliad recites again and again, a woman's place was to tend to a man's bed, spindle her loom, and care for the household.  Also given that Achilles was more fond of Patroclus than women, I don't think he would have cared one bit what his female captive thought with regards to anything other than obeying his commands.<br /><br />In terms of plot, the film leads the audience to believe that the siege of Troy was a picnic lasting only a few weeks instead of ten years.  The film has both Agamemnon and Menelaus die before or during the sack of Troy which is completely at odds with the story: this was done simply to have Helen run off with Paris again in the end.  The latter is the most stupid part of the film both in terms of plot and theme.  Even in the film, Paris is the epidemy of cowardice and is anything but manly in battle: to have him live and run off with Helen into the sunset is to make the coward the hero.  It's as if Dobbs in "Treasure of the Sierra Madre" kills everyone else and runs off with the gold.  This type of plot structure is anti-climactic and undermines the entire thematic arrangement for an epic.  An epic is a hero's tale, not a coward's: to make it otherwise isn't creative, it's just nonsensical.<br /><br />The battle scenes were uninspiring while the tactics and armaments were inaccurate.  The phalanx was not a tactic used in the Iliad.  The Iliad is quite descriptive in showing that the chariot dominated the battlefield while the infantry had a secondary role.  The phalanx is a product of the citizen army of classical Greece, not the feudal armies of the Mycenean civilization.  The funniest part is having Achilles' men use a Roman "testudo" or turtle formation that didn't really come into existence until 1000 years later.  The galleys shown in the film are also from the 5th century B.C. and not the 13th century B.C.: it would be the same as depicting sailing vessels of the 18th century with the crude ships of the Middle Ages.<br /><br />In conclusion, this film is appalling in both concept and execution.  I think it all starts witht he atrocious screenplay and Peterson's desperate efforts at directing this piece of trash into something watchable.  I don't blame the actors too much for their lack of inspiration since they didn't have anything inspiring to work with in the first place.  If you want to see this film because you never read the Iliad, don't bother: this film barely resembles the story. The plot is absurd and undermines the whole idea of an epic tale.  Read the Iliad instead of watching this rubbish; it's more inspiring and Homer's battle descriptions are far more graphic than any of the action sequences in this pathetic film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UW83R0JOZZ6.html">A2UW83R0JOZZ6</a><br/><p>Before "Troy" was ever released, it was subject to comparison to 2000's Oscar-winning film "Gladiator".  The time period that both take place in is similar and both have their roots in Greek/Roman history.  The films have their obvious heroes and protagonists and one veteran actor from the golden age of Hollywood (Peter O'Toole, Richard Harris).  Even the score by Howard Shore (A Beautiful Mind, Titanic) seeks to imitate the haunting eastern chants created by composer Lisa Gerrard (Whale Rider, The Insider).  Despite its best efforts to measure up, "Gladiator" is both technically and artistically a better film than "Troy" and the rest of this review will more than explain why.<br /><br />For this story, the clock rewinds 3200 years, the opening scene a blown-up map of the Greek empire during 1100 BC.  Many of Greece's cities are now under the rule of the militaristic autocrat Agamemnon (Cox), save one - Thessaly, a coastal region that resides westward of King Priam's (O'Toole) proud municipality of Troy.  Agamemnon's brother and fellow sovereign Menelaus (Gleeson) is amicable to the Trojans, inviting them to a sumptuous repast in his homeland of Sparta.  Rather than feasting his eyes on the myriad of dancing ladies that frolic about the banquet table, Prince Paris (Bloom) instead gazes longingly at Menelaus's young and resplendent wife Helen (Kruger).  Little does Menelaus know, Helen has been cavorting with Paris for quite some time and after another passionate embrace that evening, the prince beseeches her to steal away with him back to Troy.  Knowing the dissension her departure from Sparta will cause, Helen nonetheless lets her heart rule her head and boards a Trojan ship, instigating a war that will last for nearly fourteen years.<br /><br />The movie's greatest assets lie with the aforementioned O'Toole (Lawrence of Arabia, My Favorite Year) and Eric Bana (The Hulk).  Bana maintains a strong sense of integrity as Hector, heir to the throne of Troy and a great warrior in his own right.  O'Toole is mesmerizing in his every scene, such a commanding presence that the role of Priam is almost beneath him.  He even commented that in his heyday, he would've "murdered to play Achilles or Hector".  What a killer performance he would've given.<br /><br />Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings) coasts along, letting his looks do most of the work and later on takes to a bow like a master (visions of Legolas are hard to avoid when he swiftly and accurately deposits arrows into his enemies).  Brian Cox and Brendan Gleeson look more like Vikings than Greeks, Cox devouring the role of Agamemnon with zeal - a little too much for his own good.  Sean Bean makes a respectable walk-on as does Julie Christie and Rose Byrne is passable as the vestal virgin Briseis.<br /><br />According to legend, Helen of Sparta was a REAL looker.  The "face that launched 1,000 ships" beheld a magic spell - one look at her ravishing physiognomy and a man was completely at her mercy.  German model Diane Kruger is no ugly duckling but she is also not phenomenal, either.  You would think a make-up artist would do their best to show off a woman's NATURAL beauty at a time when eyeshadow and mascara weren't available but Kruger's pleasant visage is loaded with cosmetics (Rose Byrne's mascara ran in every weepy scene).  It may as well be a Maybelline ad, not a period piece.<br /><br />As far as aesthetics, Brad Pitt is perfect as the unyielding Achilles.  With a 6-month training period before shooting in Malta even began, Pitt defined every major muscle group with the help of personal trainer Gregory Joujon-Roche.  The result is sizable biceps, thick and defined hamstrings and calves and perfect pectorals offset by a rippling six-pack.  His body alone is a wonder of the world.<br /><br />His acting, however, is less than legendary.<br /><br />Try as he might, Pitt is not made for a purely dramatic role and the portrayal of the stalwart Achilles suffers for it.  The dialogue loses some of its integrity for three reasons: Pitt rushes it, misinterprets it and tries ever so delicately to imply a British accent, no doubt to feel up to his British peers (Bloom, Bana, O'Toole, etc.).  "Devil's Own" was proof enough that Pitt is not adept at faking it, but thankfully he doesn't embarrass himself to that level here.  All the same, his awkwardness in Achilles's shoes is felt and don't let the rumors about his supposed "nude scene" fool you - not even a full shot of his tone, tanned glutes is available.  Of course, this rumor was designed to get the women flocking en masse to the cineplex, as was the casting of two other hard bodies with handsome mugs (Bana, Bloom).<br /><br />The script is highly lacking - there are shining moments, such as the meeting between Priam and Achilles after the poignant death of an integral character and Achilles's first encounter with Prince Hector while sacking a sacred temple.  The rest lies flat, particularly the dialogue between foes.  There is either too much talk or not enough of it and the exchange is spiritless and inconsequential.  The villains of the story are hard to appreciate for their duplicity nearly as much as the conniving Commodus of "Gladiator" (bravura performance from Joaquin Phoenix) and the central female character of Helen is meek compared to the dignified and discerning Lucilla (Connie Nielsen).<br /><br />"Troy" also attempts to wow the pants off its audience with its myriad of CGI tricks, the movie's visual effects team creating tens upon thousands of digital soldiers for the storming of Troy's beaches and the sweeping vista of the 1,000 ships that sail across the Aegean on their way to war.  "Gladiator" had a much smaller digital stratagem, the most major being the coliseum that resided in the heart of Rome.  With half its images created by a series of complicated clicks on a mouse, "Troy" can't really be praised for exquisite cinematography - it's practically farmed in techno-land.<br /><br />So if you're headed to the video store this evening and can't decide between "Gladiator" or "Troy", this review should help you make a quick (and smart) decision.</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>Wolfgang Peterson's "Troy" is a film for action buffs and not for classicists.  Here, immortality does not belong to the gods but instead to the fierce warrior, Achilles, who intends to fight the kind of battles that will etch his name in history for thousands of years.  A bit egotistical, yes, but it makes for a ferociously buff Brad Pitt intent on stealing the show, both as an actor and as a character.  "Troy" gives us an insolent Achilles (Pitt), lethal killer and hedonist, who fears no one, not even Agamemnon (Brian Cox), the king he fights for and for whom Achilles has nothing but disdain.  When Menoleus' wife Helen (Diane Kruger) steals off with the effete Paris (Orlando Bloom), brother-in-law Agamemnon sees the perfect opportunity to launch a war against his nemesis Priam (Peter O'Toole).<br /><br />Bloom's Paris is such a moronic wimp that it's hard to imagine he had the guts to convince Helen to escape with him to Troy.  Diane Kruger's Helen is equally clueless; even when she finally realizes that her departure from Sparta has jeopardized an entire nation, her attempts at rectifying matters are feeble and easy to put aside.  This choice to steer away from true passion and to present the couple as ineffectual is partly what makes "Troy" such a riveting film; the battles rage around Paris and Helen even though neither is worthy of such passion and violence, making the war seem unstoppable and stoked by more deeply rooted issues of pride, power, and greed. Despite its failings, "Troy" doesn't not have a boring moment in it.<br /><br />The stupidity of bringing the Trojan Horse inside the city walls recalls Monty Python, and some of the lines spoken by Paris and Helen are laughable; however, the film contains some fine roles and performances.  Peter O'Toole portrays a human Priam, gentle and full of love for his sons, and Cox's Agamemnon makes a dangerously arrogant foil for him.  Eric Bana as Hector exudes nobility and honor as well as a fierce passion for his family.  Sean Bean's Odysseus is so natural and likeable that I wished he had a bigger role.  The most astonishing performance is Brad Pitt, who is wholly believable as the unparalleled warrior and lover Achilles. He evokes barbarianism and passion in one sidelong look.<br /><br />As long as viewers don't expect accuracy, those looking for a riveting story and physical clashes will enjoy this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>For some reason, Gladiator with Russell Crowe has been the uber-epic fix for people who want their storytelling rooted in history. I didn't even like it but every film that looks like a period piece is all of a sudden fodder for "not better than Gladiator" comments. While Troy is more of a spectacle than that film, it's still not a powerhouse the film wants to be.<br /><br />The basics of Troy, based loosely or exactly depending on how you're watching, on Homer's poem The Iliad, a way too long poem about an affair between Paris, prince of Troy and Helen, wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta. After a celebration of Troy and Sparta being friends, the people from Troy hed back home, bringing Helen with them. Menelaus finds out, plays the anger-stricken husband so what does he do? What any other man would do: get the king of Greece, Agememnon, to command an army against Troy of course.<br /><br />Among the king's warriors is Achilles, a well-known and arrogant soldier. While all soldiers are loyal to the king, he questions him, like why would the king send tens of thousands of men just for a girl, or Troy's beliefs in the gods. Among Troy's ranks are Hector, another well-known soldier but less arrogant and more reluctant to fight if the case doesn't call for it. After the opening arrival on the beach, Achilles captures Bresias, an Apollo server, who he ends up falling for.<br /><br />It's funny how the basics of the film are 2 kids deciding to love each other and run away together only to bring death and mayhem in doing so. A huge epic story told through the eyes of teenagers not thinking things through clearly.<br /><br />As for the performances, the only 3 I liked were Peter O'Toole, playing the king of Troy; Rose Byrne(Bresias), who somehow manages to make a so-so film worth watching and make you feel symphathetic towards like in Wicker Park, even if she's vastly underused. The last one being Eric Bana, who was rather bland in Hulk, but gives the right amount of pathos and energy to a very static character. As for the others? Well, as for the 2 lovers, you wouldn't be able to stomach their performances on a bad NBC show, let alone here.<br /><br />As far as the effects are concerned, maybe Lord of the Rings spoiled me but seeing 70,000 men fight doesn't have that wowness that Pelennor Fields battle had in Return of the King. And of course, right before the battle we get another "they will never take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!" wannabe pre-battle speech, which is getting more and more common since Braveheart's release.<br /><br />All in all, you want to like this film for the amount of time and effort that was put into it, but like a car, it's got to perform well no matter how it looks and this let's say breaks down half the time.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>This is the brutal speech of Agamenon in the first third of the film which preserved the intense epic gaze of this immortal work of the greatest european poet Homer .<br /><br />Obviously Petersen is not Kurosawa . Nevertheless Petersen makes a wonderful camera work . The cast is not entirely homogeneus . The ravishing presence of O'Toole as Priamo established such rank level than literally he sent to the rest of the cast to a very worthable second level; personally I suppose O' Toole at last will win a prize of the Academy as Best supporting actor in 2005 (though between you and me we know he doesn't need it)  ; Brian Cox as Agamemnon and Brendan Gleason as Menelao are first rate . The very brief presence of Julie Christie as Thetis is unforgettable. Pitt looks a little overacted ; it is absolutely true that no other actor in this moment was more appropiatte than him ; but in my opinion I missed the presence of the inner mood in certain moments of loneliness of Achilles .<br /><br />However the sumptuosity and the epic breathe are still present  all along the film.<br /><br />Orlando Bloom is fine as Paris . He embodies all the cowardness and lack of braveness , and Erik Bana was OK.<br /><br />But beware with Garret Hedlund as Patroclo ; there are certain twist of the real character of him and Hedlund gave a very romantic approach ; Kruger is a very beautiful woman but she looks extremely cool and geometric .<br /><br />The film experiments a visible decline since the Hector death and the Troy invassion . I reall do not know what was going on ; because these crucial moments are told so kinetically without any drop of dark poetry and the serenity of such tragical moment demanded . It seemed the producers would have considered this section of the story without relevance and the last sequences look like a fast account of the facts .<br /><br />Nevertheless it is a watchable and dazzling visual film .</p></br><a href="../users/AF3X7J0XC391L.html">AF3X7J0XC391L</a><br/><p>As a fan of Homer and Virgil I have to say this was one of the most disappointing movies seen in some time.  After the early scene of the "thousand ships" which was incredible, the plot slid quickly downhill.  Mr. Pitt did a good job with the character of Achilles and others were acceptable in their roles but so much of the story had been changed that it not only made an Odyssey sequel problematic but robbed the story of the wonderful reconciliation stories that followed.  The characters become one-dimensional and unbelievable from a script that took far too many liberties in attempts to "improve" a story that has stood the test of millenia.  Sad that the director/writers could not have left well enough alone and just told the story as it was meant to be told without the improvements of individuals noticably less talented than Virgil or Homer.  It gains two stars for the stunning photography and visual effects but loses other stars for its tedious and directionless plot.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>This movie is absolutely awesome. I started off watching this movie expecting to be bored for the next 3 hours of my life, but surpringly, I'm glad to say that I was wrong. Brad Pitt as Achilles makes this entire movie worth watching anyway, but the fact that he totally kicked @ss was an added bonus. Not only is he extremely HOTT!, but he can also pull off playing a Greek legend like a charm. Quite frankly, I haven't seen Brad carry a movie this great in quite some time, so I am most certainly impressed. I also must admit that I underestimated Eric Bana's character "Hector" as well because he actually played a great warrior. I was also shocked to see Peter O'Toole because he's definitely a face that I haven't seen in a long time, and he still looks great for his age might I add. I can honestly say that the only character that I was a little diappointed with was Orlando Bloom's character "Paris". It's a good thing that he had so many other stronger characters supporting his role because clearly he was just the weak link of the movie. Don't get me wrong, I like Orlando Bloom, I really do, but his character just wasn't in the same league as the others. To keep it short, I would definitely recommend that anyone who hasn't seen this movie check it out, and then buy it for your collection. I know I plan to.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>Technically, this movie is a blast.  For a geek like myself, it was fun sitting through the sections explaining how the movie got made.  There was the training of the stuntmen (but it conveniently left out the Bulgarians' strike for the extreme condition that they worked in and also the pay packets), how the scenes tied in together even when the location shoots were located at Mexico and Malta, the editing, the sound effects, et cetera.  The behind the scene segment also talked about what we already knew about the hurricane that destroyed the set, the delay due to reconstruction of the Troy fortress and waiting for Brad Pitt's achilles tendon to heel (ironic)?  In terms of the acting, it was good in patches but one couldn't help but notice that the acting was secondary to this grand spectacle when they had to strictly adhere to the structures to make sure that it worked like a clockwork.  Peter O'Toole was faultless in playing Priam and as Brad Pitt said himself, the scene of Priam asking for Hector's body back for a proper burial was the highlight of his career and understandly so.  Eric Bana was charismatic and tremendous as the reluctant and tormented Hector who fought for his beloved country, Troy and his obligation as a Prince and as a protector to his younger brother, Paris.  Brad Pitt was almost always criticised for being too good looking for his role but his presence in this movie was credible.  Sean Bean was faultless playing the king of Ithaca, a pragmatist ruler who mediated between Achilles and Argamenon and sided with the Greek for his country's livelihood.  Then, there was the priestess (an Australian girl whose name had escaped me) and also Achilles' love interest in this movie who stole every scenes that she was into.  Then, there was Brian Cox (reminding me so much of Dennis Hopper on a bad hair day), Orlando Bloom (not another epic movies with his involvement in it - yawn).  All these characters basically tied the whole movie together.  Despite that it's such a visually exciting movie, it is akin to Titanics, devoid of a soul which would make it a modern classics.  This disturbed me.  Perhaps, we all knew that this is a tragedy and in the end, everybody died.  There wasn't a just cause in this story and the massacre of people from both sides were simply senseless especially when we knew that it was all started of the vanity of Paris, falling in love with a married woman when he wasn't supposed to.  I would remember Bravehearts for we have a tendency to vouch for the underdogs especially when we know that  Conqueror was arrogant and devious in their conquest of Scotland.  We would also vouch for mel Gibson's character again in the Patriots for his family was under threat and as a father, he had to do what's necessary not simply to defend his family but also his country.  All of these were something that we would attach our feelings to but for a Greek tragedy that was almost four thousand years old, it's a bit difficult.  Wolgang Petersen wanted to do this movie because he missed his chance in the Gladiators but in the end, Gladiators, to me, scored on the emotional side as we had empathy for someone who had lost everything and to revenge against someone who had wronged him.  Anyhow, if you can overlook the mixture of accents in this movie, having Englishmen, Aussies, American, Bulgarians, Mexicans and if you can also overlook the faithfulness of this movie to the Greek tragedy, this is actually quite an entertainment movie to be shared around!</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>It's long. With a lot of material smooshed in a hurry. This blinding pace is set at the very outset, when the preamble text flashes some hard-to-read fonts in quick scattershots, so we begin the film with a muddle of Greek names we don't quite grasp, much less care for. <p>Once we do get into it, there are bouts of overacting and just campy cheese as the purpose and background of many things go unexplained. <p>The whole episode of capturing of Helen of Troy happens in a blink, before we have been told who's who. Helen, btw, the very raison-d'etre of the entire Trojan war is some pan-faced damsel about as expressive as a cardboard, a horrid glitch in casting, and she not once makes a dent in our emotions. <p>Come to think of it, Eric Bana and Peter O' Toole are the only decent actors the film sports, and both of them are sadly under-rationed their bit of screen time. Brad Pitt is wooden and Hollywood poster-boyish as ever, although towards the end he does show that he can muster a tear or two. <p>But the war scenes are superbly done. Especially some episodes such as one-on-one combat between Hector and Achilles (Bana and Pitt respectively), plus a few war strategy themes. The oceanside looks suitably spectacular (Malta?) so the imagery guys get a nod from me. I still marvel at how such huge crowds can be hired for stunts, as not all of it is CGI. <p>War is wretched business, but unlike recent farces like "The Last Samurai", this movie shows what true warfare used to be like -- there was honor among thieves and even bloody wars followed rules. <p>A couple of not-so-overt themes stood out to me: <p>(1) ATHEISM:<br />The emperor of Troy commits not one but two blunders by listening to his pretentiously pious minister whose holy crap about Apollo was almost always misguided. On both these occasions some common sense was at hand too, from the emperor's own sons, and ignoring them was catastrophic for Troy. Makes one wonder if there was an agnostic message hidden somewhere.<p>(2) MESSAGE DENOUNCING WILD ABANDON:<br />Achilles has a heroic dialog with his cousin where he (ill-)advises the latter to "don't waste your time following some fool's orders". This advice instigates the cousin to do a wild turn in the war and get himself killed. Anyone see what I see? <p>It's stuff like this and some mildly amusing remember-me lines such as "War is young men dying and old men talking" that make the movie a worthy investment of your time. Don't expect quite a classic but it's decent popcorn entertainment for the 3 hours it takes to make its point.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZCA4LTTVGAD.html">A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</a><br/><p>I must admit, I went to see &quot;Troy,&quot; directed by Wolfgang Petersen, with lowered expectations, based on some of the less-than-glowing information that I had gleaned about the movie from the press.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised: I loved the movie!  &quot;Troy,&quot; inspired by the classic Iliad of Homer, tells the story of the ancient war between Greece and Troy.  Crucial to this larger conflict between nations is the personal conflict between the Greek warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt) and the Trojan prince Hector (Eric Bana).<p>It's been too many years since I read the Iliad for me to critique the film based on the source material (I'll leave that task to others).  But as a film on its own, &quot;Troy&quot; works for me.  It's a big, sweeping epic, full of huge battles, exciting one-on-one combat, romance, family drama, political intrigue, and theological debate.<p>There are fine performances all around.  Bana is appealing as Hector, who is both a brave soldier and a devoted family man.  Pitt gives an intriguing spin to Achilles; the character is enigmatic and at times prickly, but ultimately it's a very moving performance.  Rose Byrne instills the Trojan priestess Briseis with a fiery strength.  But if the cast has a secret weapon, it's Peter O'Toole as the Trojan king Priam; the veteran actor brings dignity, majesty, and a down-to-earth humanity to his royal role.<p>&quot;Troy&quot; is gloriously beautiful to look at; virtually every scene is a treat for the eyes.  One interesting aspect of the film is its naturalistic approach to the subject matter.  There are no toga-clad gods or fantastic monsters in the mix here; rather, it's all about the human condition.  Overall director Petersen achieves an effective balance of action, big epic vistas, and intimate personal scenes. Although &quot;Troy&quot; tells an ancient story, the script raises issues that remain relevant today.  The film deals with leadership, loyalty, the role of a soldier in society, and the impact of war on families.  It's a compelling story, well told by a talented cast and crew.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>With this movie came a deilverance of a reality check.Men have for ages been warriors and it lies within our system to have a desire for rage and physical superiority."Troy" made me realise a lot of things.Its gigantic in its scope and absolute devotion to the theme it wishes to potray to the audience.<br /><br />A very interesting thing I noticed about most of the characters of the film was not the good acting and devotion to their role but the fact that their eyes spoke what their character demanded.Upon carefully analysing not for a second did I feel Im watching a movie. Its not at all exaggerated despite the countless number of characters with very well defined attributes. Brad Pitt was larger than life in this film.<br /><br />Its impossible to have favourites in Troy but the one character in this film that left me spellbound with his integrity and isolation of soul was "Hector"(Eric Bana) There were certain scenes with him in the film that bought out the Trojan in me.<br /><br />It'll be an absolute waste of time trying to figure out what I disliked about the film because I was completely spellbound and awestruck by the dialogues. I've lost count on the number of times a dialogue made me feel absolutely awakened and insignificant.<br /><br />The one dialogue I do waguely remember was the scene in which the little kid,messenger,demands Achillies presence at the war grounds. The kid says "I wouldn't fight a man as big as him." And Pitt(Achillies) replies " ..thats why your name will not be remembered" Now I dont know what that did to the audience and how the audience in the theater reacted to it but it awoke a certain rage in me. I stood up and cheered for some reason beyond me.Always felt the insignificant need provocation and if this film doesnt certify everything I stand for and re-enforce all of its endless number of salutes it demands then nothing ever will.<br /><br />I know I am noone to judge something as mangamous as this but in my most honest opinion this film killed doubts in the line of thought imbred in me. A lot of dialogues and scenes in the film cannot be forgotten. I demand of everyone reading to go watch this film. Either rent the DVD or buy it but please watch it for your own good.I borrowed a friend's DVD . I can't wait to give it a second watch cause its an education in itself. This movie deserves being purchased and I shall do so ASAP. Quiet possibly the most brilliant historical re-capturing.<br /><br />With Much Muted Respect and 36 Salutes.</p></br><a href="../users/A33IZJVCKFKDPU.html">A33IZJVCKFKDPU</a><br/><p>The classic interpretation of Homer's "The Illiad" comes to life in Wolfgang Peterson's "Troy."  The story is about a young Trojan named Paris who steals a Greek king's wife, Helen (you know, the face that launched a thousand ships!).  Anyways, the Greeks use this as an excuse to conquer the city of Troy, the city whose walls have never fallen to foreign nations.  The Greeks get the warrior Achilles to fight on their side.  The Trojans and the Greeks fight.  The Greeks make a horse with troops inside, in order to enter the walls of Troy and open its doors to the rest of their troops and eventually conquer Troy.  That is the quick overview of the story without revealing too many turning points of the storyline.<p>Brad Pitt plays the role of Achilles.  Achilles fought this war in order to be remembered throughout the ages, not because he believed in the Greeks cause.  He does a very good job at this role and I believed that he is a great warrior.  Eric Bana played Hector, the leader of the Trojan army and a prince of Troy.  Hector was my favorite character of the movie.  He is a very honorable man and well respected.  He stayed true to his country and his family.  Orlando Bloom plays Paris, the person who basically started this whole war.  I was really hoping that Paris would get his in the end.  I just thought that his character was too romantic and didn't care that thousands of people would die so he could have his fling.<p>The most impressive aspect of this movie was Peterson's direction.  I like how he made Achilles have some emotional scenes and have some human aspects to him, instead of being some inhuman killing machine.  The battle sequences in the movie flashed from scene to scene a little too quick for me.  But the highlight were the greatly choreographed individual fight scences, especially the one between Hector and Achilles.  The big battle scenes looked very good and the CGI was not bothersome. <p>This movie is extremely good.  It is very well acted, well directed and the movie moved at a good pace.  The movie is about 2 hours and 40 mins. long and it really doesn't feel like it.  There is a lot of good action in this movie and the storyline is very interested, even if you've read the story and know whats going to happen.  I would highly recommend seeing this movie and wouldn't be surprised to see this movie mentioned in Febuary/March of next year.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>According to Homer's "The Illiad" (which may or may not have been based on an actual event), the love between Trojan prince Paris and Helen of Troy caused the great city of Troy to fall. Similarly, Wolfgang Petersen's epic "Troy" nearly falls itself.<br /><br />The storytelling is fairly weak. The set-up for the tale goes by too fast, and little time is spent on really getting to know many of the characters of the film. The battle sequences are big and well-crafted with fantastic choreography and breathtaking CG effects, but they lack both the excitement and emotion that were clearly evident in Oliver Stone's superb epic "Alexander."<br /><br />The casting is also a problem. Like most other people, I agree that Brad Pitt was miscast as Achilles. I've never liked Pitt as an actor, and the character is portrayed more as an anti-hero. Brian Cox does not make Agememnon a convincing leader, or villain for that matter. Orlando Bloom seems to still be channeling Will Turner from "Pirates of the Caribbean" in his portrayal of Paris.<br /><br />However, there are some great performances. Eric Bana is great as Hector. I rooted for him in the one-on-one battle with Achilles, even though I knew what the outcome would be. Peter O'Toole is great at giving Trojan King Priam a Shakespearean feel. Sean Bean is great as Odysseus. If they ever do "The Odyssey," he should be approached to do so. It is these performances that make the 162-minute film bearable.<br /><br />Overall, the film is mostly a letdown. It has some good moments in terms of acting and battle, but I recommend "Alexander" as the best "Sword and Sandals" epic of 2004. As for "Troy," it's best to be viewed once, and that is all.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: C+</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>I previously owned the HD DVD copy of this epic but traded it when I heard that there would be a Directors Cut which would be an improvement on the previous one as far as the video. If you're a fan of this film as I was, then I would recommend this epic whole-heartedly. Some of the dialogue is a little too contemporary for a film of this type and Diane Kruger seems somewhat wooded as Helen but a great beauty nevertheless but Pitt and Eric Bana do excel as the rivals in the war and they're supported by a fine cast of veteran actors such as Brian Cox & the great Peter O'Toole.  This film doesn't quite fall in the classic status like "Gladiator" but nevertheless Wolfgang Petersen has delivered an enjoyable, entertaining epic with awesome battle scenes that DeMille would be proud of.  Definitely a must if you have a HDTV that is 50" or more!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>If you enjoy epic battles then this movie should move you. The fact there is a good storyline with it won't hide the fact this is a movie about epic men and women and great bloody battles. I must say though the gore was not overdone as in some movies. This is no worse than "Ben Hur" or some other of that caliber. I enjoyed it thoroughly since I thought the casting and acting was great. The love stories and tradgedies follow the true stories fairly well. The timeline is a bit askew but we are no worse off for that. We get the overall story and see where the lines "Beware Greeks Bearing Gifts" and "Achilles Heel" come from.<br /><br />There are those that would think Brad Pitt was not right for the part of Achilles, but if that was so, he did a fine job of making it his part. His fights were choregraphed meticuously and are worth seeing the movie for alone. The detailed methods of fighting showed me some moves that I had not seen in this type movie before but make perfect since to me. Afterall a moving target is hard to hit, and Achilles moves very well. I recommend it if you enjoy this type movie. Personally I like these real people movies over the CGI types. You can feel their sweat and blood. I think most the family can watch this as it is no different in theme than many of the classic sword and sandal movies. Excellent quality DVD with good replayability.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>Movies these days are won or lost on the hype that precedes them. Not only that, but after those expectations are developed, the film maker must follow through for that movie to have any staying power which results in it's making any money at the box office. So often we are built up to believe one thing only to be disappointed once we sit down and the lights go dim. Such is not the case with TROY.<br /><br />Many years ago the sword and sandal movies were a staple in Hollywood. They reached a grand scale with movies like BEN-HUR and bottomed out with others like HERCULES IN NEW YORK. But these films were movies that people went to see and either loved or hated. Times changed and with the interest in more real storied that developed in the late sixties and early seventies, it seemed none were made. The release and success of GLADIATOR changed that. And as much as I enjoyed that film, I liked this one even more.<br /><br />For those who don't know the story or have never read the Iliad (include me in that category), it revolves around the attempts of Agamemnon (Brian Cox) to bring together all of the states of Greece under his rule. He is out to establish an empire and is on the verge of doing just that. The film opens with a battle between his army and that of Thessaly about to occur. A challenge is made and they place their best man against his to cut down on casualties, winner takes all. His challenger is Achilles (Brad Pitt), the fiercest warrior ever known. The battle takes mere seconds and the character of Achilles is established for all to see.<br /><br />The scene shifts to Sparta where the brother of Agamemnon and king, Menelaus (Brendan Gleason) has just signed a peace treaty with Troy and its representatives Prince Hector (Eric Bana) and Prince Paris (Orlando Bloom). As a feast ensues, Menelaus wife Helen (Diane Kruger) leaves to her room, followed by Paris. The two have been together since his arrival and now she plans to run off with him. This sets in motion the war that is to be waged as Menelaus attempts to regain his wife while Agamemnon uses the excuse to lead his army into battle to win Troy.<br /><br />Leading a fleet of a thousand ships, Agamemnon must also swallow his pride for a moment. He and Achilles never see eye to eye and have even come close to battle themselves. But with the help of Odysseus (Sean Bean) he recruits Achilles to be a part of this force setting out for Troy.<br /><br />It is not for the sake of Agamemnon that Achilles fights. Nor is it for the honor of Menelaus or to rescue his wife. Achilles fights for glory and for honor. He fights so that his name might live on long after he has departed Earth. A vision by his mother Thetis (Julie Christie) tells him this will happen, but that he will never return to her.<br /><br />The ships sail and the Trojans prepare for war. Their walls have never been breached and they are confidant that no matter who attacks, they will be victorious. King Priam (Peter O'Toole) backs his son Paris' and his love for Helen. War is coming their way and they are as prepared as they can be to battle this incredible army.<br /><br />There you have it, the set up for a grand and glorious movie about war. And in reading just that much, you might expect that it deals only with the victories and failures of the men involved. But there is so much more going on in this film. And amazingly enough, it never presents war as a bad thing or a good thing. It shows it for what it really is, a clash of two parties that yields both good and bad.<br /><br />It shows the honor between men fighting together in a solid unit as one, using tactics instead of brute strength to win a battle. It shows men willing to lay down their lives for something they believe in, for a leader that commands them to do so.<br /><br />At the same time, it shows a leader who is blinded by his own ego, men dying due to poor leadership and the fact that death is everlasting and not a grand as the cry before battle might make it out to be. Some men will walk away as heroes to be spoken of from that day forward. Others will become nothing more than fuel for funeral pyres.<br />The mix of these ideas back and forth makes this movie more real than most and less political than many would assume we will find in this day and age.<br /><br />The battles are well made, presenting not only the best that CGI has to offer in showing thousands involved in combat, but the up close fighting is more real than most seen in some time. The hand to hand combat, the archers' arrows landing in the most gruesome ways, the use of anything on hand to become a weapon make it all seem real.<br /><br />The acting is stupendous with Brad Pitt taking the lead. Pitt has done some great films in the past and has shown that he is not just another pretty face. But this film uses everything from his looks to his physical abilities to form a character that the audience comes to sympathize with as well as fear.<br /><br />Eric Bana also excels as Hector. His character is also a warrior to be reckoned with but one with more heart, with more at stake, with more foresight to see what can become of this whole mess. While Achilles fights for glory, Hector fights to protect his land and his family, to protect that which he loves most. And Bana portrays this with an insight rarely seen or shown in most actors these days.<br /><br />Perhaps the weakest link in the entire film is a character that should be center stage, Paris as played by Orlando Bloom. While I thought him fantastic in the LORD OF THE RINGS films, Bloom has yet to make an impression on me since. His portrayal of Paris here is as if he were a twit and a coward, a man who thinks only of himself and his pleasures at the expense of everything and everyone else. If this was who he was then Bloom does a better job than I give him credit for. I still see him as only a simpering wimp here and not the hottest actor working today.<br /><br />The directing is amazing with Wolfgang Peterson turning in another stupendous job. He uses everything he can at his disposal to get the tale put onscreen in its entirety. Scenes of battle mingle with scenes of tenderness, both presented as real and as a part of the story that when brought together tell the entire tale.<br /><br />Hollywood has for years forsaken the genre of epic in an attempt to make more money on smaller films. Battling against everything from video games to the internet, it has gone back to draw viewers into seats once more. If they can continue to produce films like this they will continue to prosper. TROY is a film that fulfilled all of my expectations, though to be honest they were not high to begin with. It is perhaps one of the best films I have seen in some time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z28WKY1LHBKY.html">A2Z28WKY1LHBKY</a><br/><p>After watching this highly superior epic four times in succession I attempted to revise and edit my first review, upwards, but Amazon wasn't having it; so I scrapped it, and now start again.<br /><br />To anyone familiar with Homeric legend there is much that is disconcerting about this telling of the story, which is different from the Iliad, although using numerous characters and incidents from the ancient Greek original --- not that the Iliad itself was original in the sense one might assume. These stories had been told and re-told, each bard adding and omitting to suit his audience and his own temperament. There seems nothing wrong, therefore, for a modern team of writer and film director to do their own thing, especially as they have deliberately changed the title of their tale, making it quite clear that they are not aiming to reproduce the classic Iliad. Any criticism which complains that Benioff and Petersen don't precisely follow Homer (if he ever existed) is barking up the wrong tree.<br /><br />This is a stunning, intriguing and fascinating movie in its own right. At first one may be taken aback, for other reasons besides its deviation from its inspiration. The dialogue is curiously throwaway and informal, to anyone brought up on the sententiously stilted posturing and declaiming of traditional celluloid epics. A number of reviewers are annoyed by what they regard as the inaccuracies and anachronisms of social life, battle techniques, armour, equipment and so forth. The fact is that no one is quite sure when, if ever, the famous siege of Troy took place --- and there is even some doubt as to where. All that is certain is that it was in the past; a long, long, time ago. This aspect is conveyed with tremendous effect. At the same time, the actions, motivations, behaviour and psychology of the individuals is bang up-to-date, and extremely convincing. The political power-play, the arrogant insubordination of Achilles, the dependency and resentful hatred of the boss, ring true. Achilles' petulance is a strong and crucial feature of the familiar version. Brad Pitt's performance, and ability to convey his utter superiority as a killing machine on the battle-field, is exceptional. The fact is that the Iliad itself centres on Achilles; his grimly fatalistic attitude, and his acceptance of a short, spectacular life instead of unmemorable longevity.<br /><br />The absence of the Gods is complained of. I didn't feel this in any way at all. The Gods are present in this movie, just as much as they are in Homer. No contemporary actually imagined that Aphrodite, Ares, Apollo and the rest appeared on the battlefield. They were conscious, however, of how little men could do to take charge of their own destinies. The hidden presence of the Gods was finely suggested: these ancient humans are presented as if in the grip of outside forces. They are doomed by fate to act out their given roles, which the Gods have decided for them. Freedom and choice were illusory. They still are --- although we are obliged to believe that we are in control of our own lives.<br /><br />Some reviewers have criticized the performances of Paris and Helen. I don't get it. The actress is beautiful, and that is all she has to be. She is merely the face that launched the thousand ships: the excuse for the war, not the real reason. Her changing expressions as she enters Troy for the first time speak volumes. Paris is a feckless playboy, a lover not a fighter, but a good archer.<br /><br />This film is stuffed with mind-expanding ideas, superb performances, spectacular action and scenery. The computer graphics are inevitable, these days, but they do conjure up powerful images. This is certainly one of the best epics I have seen --- perhaps the very best; and I'm astonished by the number of negative reviews.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Wolfgang Petersen's "Troy" bears all the hallmarks of a major studio production for a summer blockbuster.  Thousands of soldiers clash in violent battle scenes, plenty of beefcake and cheesecake to go around (but not too racy as to potentially offend anyone), famous and semi-famous actors even in marginal roles, and more than a bit of romance.  All this points to the good, but the problem is that in taking this perspective to the battle of Troy, Petersen and his team generally gutted the "Iliad," which is only one of the foundations of the Western Canon and with plenty of devoted fans.<br /><br />Brad Pitt's Achilles is the best example of how "Troy" fundamentally changed a major character.  Pitt's Achilles is no longer a semi-immortal, beloved of the Gods and vulnerable only in the heel that his mother held when she dipped him in the River Styx.  Instead, he's "just" the best warrior out there.  Pitt's Achilles is no longer the desperately vain hero of the "Iliad," but instead is a thoughtful man given to internal anguish over things like loyalty, duty, and the like.  Also abandoned is Achilles' love for his friend Patroclus -- rather than touch upon any hint of homosexuality, the script makes Achilles and Patroclus cousins.  This doesn't quite work as justification for Achilles' rage after Patroclus' death -- as more than one Trojan points out to Achilles, how many cousins, father, sons, and brothers have you killed, you hypocrite?  I can't say Pitt was miscast as Achilles, given Pitt's excellent work in other films -- the character was just poorly written.  His sacrifice for the maiden Briseas is just plain wrong, but it gives Pitt a chance for a "Hollywood" dying speech . . . yeesh.<br /><br />"Troy" also completely abandons the role of the Greek gods in the battle, which dismisses one of the major plot lines in the "Iliad."  I'm sure this was done for the sake of getting the movie completed in under 3 hours -- there are already a lot of characters to begin with -- but the Gods elevate the battle of Troy from mere tale to the level of myth, and their absence is telling.  Indeed, the Trojans, with the exception of Hector (a stoic Eric Bana), are generally led to their downfall to their devotion to "the Gods," who never show up, while the Greeks are motivated by more worldly (and therefore practical) considerations.<br /><br />The movie gets many things right, even as it rewrites the story. Paris and Helen, whose affair starts the whole bloody mess, are as passive and self-absorbed as they are in the "Iliad" -- note how Paris (Orlando Bloom) continually fails to rise to the occasion.  Other characters who shine in the "Iliad," such as Odysseus, Nestor, Ajax, and Menelaus, are not given nearly as much time to shine and are used generally as plot devices.<br /><br />There are several solid performances in "Troy," particularly Brian Cox as the dastardly Agamemnon and Peter O'Toole as the wizened Priam, and if you're not that familiar with the "Iliad," you will probably be able to enjoy "Troy" more on its own merits than someone who is really bothered by the fact that "Troy" takes place over a few weeks while the "Iliad" recounts the last year in a ten-year battle.<br /><br />The DVD looks great, and the battle scenes are enjoyable even if they don't rise to the recent heights established by Peter Jackson's "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy.<br /><br />All in all, "Troy" is a good movie that somewhat disappoints because it could have been great.  Unfortunately, by trying to make a blockbuster, the filmmakers trimmed corners and softened the edges of one of the great tales of Western Civilization . . . maybe they should have respected the fact that Homer has had considerable box office appeal for over 3,000 years.</p></br><a href="../users/A9I40WFF40R4.html">A9I40WFF40R4</a><br/><p>Making these kinds of movies is fraught with dangers. There are so many things that can go wrong, and some things did in this expensive-- costs were nearly two hundred millions dollars-- epic "inspired" by Homer's ILIAD.<br /><br />First the good: there are certainly many things to like about this movie. Although the film is about three hours long, the action moves rapidly. The ship scenes as well are the hand-to-hand combat battles are quite amazing and really do become epic-like. Some of the acting is terrific as well. Eric Bana as Hector gives a first-rate performance. Julie Christie in a small role as Achilles' mother is also great. But Peter O'Toole as King Priam-- British accent notwithstanding-- is simply wonderful. (Of course he is no stranger to period pieces with movies such as BECKET, LION IN WINTER and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA under his belt.) The scene where he approaches Achilles to beg for the dead body of his beloved son Hector achieves high tragedy, something that rarely happens in epics. Just as in grand opera with its usual outrageous plots, when real acting occurs, it's all the more appreciated.<br /><br />Then those things that really aren't that significant (so-so). First, the director plays hard and fast with the original story; but after all, it's just his inspiration, not his roadmap. Remember: the movie is not the book. There are also missed opportunities. For instance, there is a beautifully scene in the ILIAD when Hector goes off to battle and sees his wife and child for what will be the last time. Because he is wearing his helmet, his baby son does not recognize him and cries. This is one of the most touching scenes in all of the ILIAD. I thought the director was setting us up for that in this movie. The child cries as Hector says goodbye, however, and then puts on his helmet later.<br /><br />Finally the bad: Orlando Bloom as Paris is totally unconvincing as someone Helen would even look at. And Brad Pitt, for all his buffed-up beauty, is still Brad Pitt, only with long hair and in ancient Grecian drag. He is completely miscast as the sober, brooding, sulking Achilles.<br /><br />The film is worth seeing, however, for all the battles and the fine acting by Peter O'Toole.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G8IR6ENZSQHF.html">A2G8IR6ENZSQHF</a><br/><p>"Troy" is in many ways an infuriating film, because it seemed like a sure thing.  Everyone knew that a major film had to be made about the battle for Troy, arguably the most famous one in the history of western civilization (at least in terms of its fame longevity).  A talented cast and proven director was assembled, it was given a $160,000,000 budget, and the prerelease hype was huge.  Of course, the film was roasted when it was finally released, and its final gross (at least domestically) was very disappointing.  Now that the hype has died down, I can say that "Troy" is not a bad movie, but just a disappointing one.<br /><br />The movie is awash in moral ambiguity.  That might work for Vietnam War films, but it is missplaced here.  We desparately want a hero to root for, but Achilles does not fit that mold.  For most of the film, he's cold, unsympathetic, and even borderline cruel.  Brad Pitt's performance does not help- it is adequate at its best moments, and terrible at its worst.  Where's Tyler Durden when you need him?<br /><br />As it turns out, the best and most sympathetic performances are given from the Trojan side, in the forms of Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole.  Bana's Hector seems to be the hero that the audience can root for, and Bana himself is terrific in the role.  This makes the film a real downer, however.  Hector's inevitable fate makes him disappear three quarters of the way through, and without him the film's ending is weak, as we've run out of people to root for.  O'Toole is also touching as the Trojan king, but he is not given enough screen time.<br /><br />Ultimately, the audience sympathizes with Troy, which makes its inevitable end that much more disappointing.  The Greeks are led by an arrogant and greedy king, played by Brian Cox with over-the-top menace (I know this guy is good at being a villain, but he should seriously consider being in a romantic comedy or something.  STRETCH a little, man!).  By the end of "Troy", we are rooting against the Greeks, and their inevitable victory renders the ending flat.  Imagine if Sauron had triumphed at the end of "Return of the King", and you'll have an idea how much of a downer "Troy" ends up being.  I suppose we're supposed to root for Achilles at the end because he has a sudden change of heart, but it's too little too late, and Pitt does not make the change in Achilles convincing.<br /><br />If you haven't realized by now, I liked "Troy" all the way up to its ending (although its running time should have been 20 minutes shorter).  The disappearance of Bana and O'Toole from the movie's final moments render them flat, and the failure of the movie to deliver a rousing climax is ultimately its undoing.  Many of the battle scenes in here are spectacular and some of the performances (at least on the Trojan side) are effective, but in the end I'm afraid that "Troy" is better for a rental than a purchase.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GA09FYFKL4EY.html">A3GA09FYFKL4EY</a><br/><p>"Troy" gives viewers a visual masterpiece with stunning costumes, sets, cinematography, and breathtakingly choregraphed battle scenes. The world's greatest love story doesn't disappoint as two men vie for possession of the most beautiful woman in the world, and Brad Pitt gives a fabulous performance as well as a fab physique as the legendary hero. Maybe it's not entirely accurate or faithful to the original - but neither was Kevin Costner's "Robin Hood." Watch it for the spectacle and the great entertainment. A must-see!</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Putting aside all the mythological characters and even many of the historical facts, TROY is an epic film that attempts to display the Trojan War in less than three hours. Seeing that the Trojan War lasted around a decade, it's almost an insane feat. However, for the most part, the movie works. There's a lot of fierce fighting and the political underpinings around the war are examined. This was a film that probably did have a cast of thousands and the 1000 ships sailing from Greece to Troy along with the conflicts that follow are spectacular.<br /><br />However, the movie could have been much better. The basic story about the Trojan War has been altered. That in itself isn't that big of a deal, but most of the things that have been changed weren't changed to make the movie flow smoother or even to make the movie more interesting. Instead, they've were changed to accommodate star Brad Pitt and give him more screen time. Normally, that wouldn't bother me much, but Pitt has been horribly miscast as Achilles. By changing the story to give him more screen time, the filmmakers have made the film less interesting and appealing.<br /><br />Another one of the big stars of the movie is Orlando Bloom. Bloom portrays the love struck Paris--you know, the guy who steals Helen away from her husband in Greece and takes her to Troy. Though Bloom looks and fits into his role better than Pitt, Bloom too, is miscast. Paris might have been somewhat of a whiner and even a bit of a wimp compared to his brother Hector, but he probably wasn't the pretty boy that he's made to be in the film (and if I'm not mistaken, according to the "real" story Paris doesn't survive the invasion of the city either).<br /><br />The real star of this movie and an actor who continues to be overlooked and underrated is Eric Bana. Bana is dead on as Hector, Troy's great warrior and the one man who could have bested Achilles had he not been so invinsible.  Bana's portrayal is perfect and would have been even had the movie been better casted.<br /><br />Overall TROY is a somewhat enjoyable film that attempts to recapture the spirit of the grand epic movie rather than tell a historically accurate description of the Trojan War. There's a little romance, some decent sword and sandal combat scenes, and a lot of pretty faces. In short, your basic Hollywood movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>I don't say &quot;Troy&quot; is a bad film; it has many virtues, like grand-scale actions and many handsome stars, who, whenever the chances are given, throw away his armors to show his torso. But as far as our emotional reaction go, &quot;Troy&quot; is as empty as that famous horse, or the smile of Helen, who is supposed to be the most beautiful woman in the world (who decides that anyway?)<br /><br /> This story of &quot;Iliad&quot; has already been covered (partially) in Robert Wise film &quot;Helen of Troy.&quot; In a nutshell, Paris, Prince of Troy (Orland Bloom) steals the married lady Helen, and his stupid action opens another war between Troy and Greece. Don't say that it's impossible for that's what Homer says.<br /><br /> So we see the siege of the Greek soldiers, who attack the city of Troy, where its leader Hector (Eric Bana) commands. But considerable time of this very long film (2h43m) is given to Achilles (Brad Pitt), who unwillingly obeys the Greek commander Agamemnon (Brain Cox) whose ruthless and villanious character makes a great contrast to other Greek soldiers such as Odysseus (Sean Bean).<br /><br /> The script by David Benioff (novelist of &quot;25th Hour&quot;) remains surprisingly faithful to the original, considering the nature of the original (it's an epic). But if you look close, you notice there are so many elements barrowed from action genre, the last 30 minute in particular, about the famous Trojan Horse episode (which is not included in Homer's poem). The script lacks the emotional punch, or the portal for the audience to enter the inside of the characters -- in short, it's very superficial.<br /><br /> The spectacular fight scenes are all great to watch, I admit, and you need a very close inspection to know what is really going on when the camera sweeps over the army on the coast of Troy. It is realistc, but at the same time very showy.<br /><br /> About the actors. I hate to say this, but Pitt is totally miscast. We need someone who looks more natural when standing with a sword like a warrior. It's true that Pitt pumped up his muscles, but that doesn't mean that he cuts a convincing figure as a deadly soldier like Achilles. He is a demi-god, hardly the fit role for Pitt who is too human (I mean in a good sense, ok?).<br /><br /> Eric Bana shows, perhaps, the better acting as Hector, whose role is not entirely an envious one. But he infuses a considerable amount of humanity to the character, making him a somewhat sympathetic man. After all, Bana is, I think, a better actor than Pitt. As to Bloom, all I can say is that his fans would be greatly disappointed by his slightly negative role (or weakness of personality).<br /><br /> Finally this. Helen. French Diane Kruger is beautiful, but looks very insipid to me. Sorry, but the story requires her to be the beauty that would destroy one nation. However, her Helen does not look such seductiveness (where is Nicole Kidman, please), and the love between her and Paris is so feeble. You know, the director Petersen (&quot;Das Boot&quot; &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot;) has never been famous for romance. but we need romance here, which is glaringly missing.</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>In Wolfgang Petersen's "Troy," the Aegean Sea never looked so gorgeous and the clashing of swords and smashing of shields never have been heard so powerful and clear...<br /><br />The city of Troy is one of the few that has not fallen under Agamemnon's influence, a fact that irritates the fearsome commander to no end...

There are too many deviations from the ancient Greek epic poem for this to be other than `inspired by' - there are characters missing (Cassandra, etc.); there are characters whose fates are different from the Illiad (I won't give spoilers, so you'll have to trust me), and the overall situation is cast in a very different light.<p>In the film, Achilles (Brad Pitt, looking more bulky than usual) is the greatest warrior alive, with a reputation unparalleled in the world.  However, he is a loose canon of sorts, as likely to kill his own leaders as the enemy.  Achilles is tempted to the battle with Troy, portrayed as one of the greatest battles in history, by the call of everlasting glory.  Achilles is persuaded in the end by no less an ironic character than his own mother, who recounts to him the prophecy of an idyllic life at home should he stay, but then to be forgotten after he dies, or the chance at immortality in legend, despite the fact that he'll die at Troy.  Achilles sets sail.<p>The war with Troy is portrayed as having been going on for a decade; at a peace meeting in Sparta, Paris (younger prince of Troy, Orlando Bloom) falls in love with the fair `was this the face that launched a thousand ships' Helen, wife Sparta's king, Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson).  Helen steals away with Paris on the ship returning to Troy;  Hector, the elder prince and heir to the throne (Eric Bana) is conflicted as to what to do, but opts to journey on to Troy, and the die is cast.<p>Agamemnon (Brian Cox) uses the event as a chance to band all the Greek city-states together into a final battle with Troy, the greatest rival to his power in the Aegean (and the centre of much of the civilization of the world at that time).  This is where the retelling becomes much more modern than ancient.  The Illiad is not so concerned with economics and hegemonies as it is with ethics and honour - Agamemnon is portrayed as a Realpolitick power-seeker of the first order, willing to stop at nothing to decimate allies and foes alike for his own power, willing to use honourable pretenses to achieve dishonourable ends.  Does one sense a thinly-veiled critique of the modern siege-makers in this?<p>An astonishing armada is amassed and sets sail for the coasts of Troy.  Once there, the beachhead is taken, and the first major act is a desecration of the temple of Apollo (a dishonouring of the local gods - again, does one sense a critique of the moderns here?) by Achilles, who nonetheless proves himself the most valuable warrior the Greeks have.  At this point, the internal strife becomes as problematic for the Greeks as the front lines, as Achilles disregards the commands of Agamemnon and cares little for the political outcomes of the war.  <p>The intrigues and the plotting of the Greek leaders are cast in high relief against the more pastoral leadership of `good king' Priam (portrayed by Peter O'Toole with his characteristic panache).  Hector is a strong and wise leader under his father; Paris is the foolish and rather cowardly one.  (We are missing the back-story of the Illiad of how Paris came to be part of Troy's royal family, and it is assumed that there is no unusual story there.)  We rather lose sight of the fact that, indeed, Paris stole the queen of Sparta (again, the modern idea creeps in - in our day, a woman would have the right to choose where she wished to live, but not so in the ancient world; one might question whether the queen of a nation has the right to abandon her role and `shack-up' with the neighbouring prince at will, but I digress...).  <p>The people of Troy are seen as virtuous despite the fact that they are defending the less-defensible position morally.  The Greeks might have right on their side in some respects, but this is lost in their brutality and by the unbridled greed of their leaders, and of course it is the ordinary foot-soldiers, including Achilles, who have to do the fighting and dying for the cause, as their princes exchange gifts of gold, money and priceless art treasures to congratulate themselves on their victories.  <p>The film portrays the battle lasting only a matter of a few weeks; the brutality of the battle scenes is as dramatic as any in modern war films, just as bloody.  The single-combat scenes between Achilles and Hector, Hector and Patroclus, and others are extremely well choreographed, introducing various techniques I've not seen before in sword-play films.  <p>I don't think it is a spoiler to give away the major ending here, in that Troy eventually falls, not to military might, but to trickery.  The Greek ships have sailed, leaving only an  offering to Poseidon behind - a giant horse.  The Trojan Horse (if the Greeks built it, why is it always called `the Trojan Horse?') is carted into the city whose walls cannot be breeched, and the people celebrate their victory.  As they rest after the revelry, Greek soldier inside the horse emerge (including in this telling, Achilles), open the gates to the city, and the Greek army swarms in.  <p>A nice touch to the film is the hand-off of the great sword of Troy to a young man named Aeneas, with the instruction that so long as a Trojan has the sword, Troy will live on (this connects to the Roman epic poem, the Aeneid, which tells of Aeneas' journey from Troy to Rome, making them the spiritual successors of Troy, particularly meaningful when the Romans then conquer the Greeks).  <p>The effects are great, as is the general cinematography.  This is a film to be seen in the theatres, for the `big screen' effect.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LZVU5SRRM3VX.html">A1LZVU5SRRM3VX</a><br/><p>If you go to other reviews in this forum, you will find some very thoughtful, thorough reviews from people comparing this film to its source material, Homer's Iliad.  Such comparisons, while interesting and worthwhile, are really pointless, since Hollywood is notorious for taking perfectly good source material and inexplicably changing pieces of it for the purposes of condensing the story, expediting exposition, or simply focusing on a different aspect of the story than has traditionally been told.  Thus, it was probably good that my memory of reading the Iliad in high school was somewhat fuzzy--it was much better for me to consider the film on its own merits, even if it did depart from Homer's storyline in a few significant respects.<br /><br />Troy might well have been titled Achilles, for Brad Pitt's character is really the centerpiece of the film.  Pitt brings an earnest, amoral righteousness to Achilles that makes the viewer realize that there is more to Pitt than a pretty face, flowing locks, good muscle tone, and an all-over tan.  Although the screenwriting pushes Achilles' struggles with Agamemmnon and his own conscience to the forefront for much of the film, the rest of the ensemble cast is similarly well-chosen.  Brian Cox is sufficiently egomaniacal as Agamemmnon, Eric Bana (who has totally underwhelmed me with previous performances) actually shows a bit of range in this film as Hector, Sean Bean makes a believable Odysseus, and Peter O'Toole is stately as Priam.  Probably the best commentary on the acting in the film is that each main character comes off as both heroic and yet fatally flawed.  Strangely enough, the face that launched a thousand ships and whose infidelity actually precipitated the Trojan War, plays a relatively minor role in the film, although Kruger (the actress playing Helen) is appropriately beautiful and conflicted in her minor role.<br /><br />The major improvement over Homer is that, apart from a few statues, temples, and offhanded references, the Greek gods are basically nonexistent in the film, giving the characters a grounding in reality instead of the supernatural.  For the purposes of this film, that is a good thing, as bringing the involvement of the gods into the affairs of men would cloud an already complicated storyline of shaky and sometimes shifting allegiances.<br /><br />The battle sequences are generally magnificently done, particularly where Achilles is involved, and although much blood is spilled, few scenes seem gratuitous or pointless.  There is purpose in these battles--the Greeks are empire building and the Trojans are protecting their homeland.  And when Achilles joins the fray, look out.  His battle sequences are sufficiently entertaining to keep the viewer fully engaged and mesmerized, yet are understated enough to leave the viewer wanting more.<br /><br />The film's pacing is also better than most movies that exceed two hours--I rarely found myself clock watching.  Petersen's directing is also generally good, although even a relatively untrained eye like mine noted some awkward cuts and angles.<br /><br />After watching some recent disappointments passing themselves off as epics (see my review of King Arthur, for example), Troy was a breath of fresh air.  Homer it's not, but I didn't rent it expecting a strict interpretation.  The film does what it sets out to do, and does so in an entertaining manner, and that's all I was hoping for.  Watch the film and enjoy the performances, just don't confuse it with the Iliad.</p></br><a href="../users/AD2BIAIH78QI5.html">AD2BIAIH78QI5</a><br/><p>...in this movie doesn't belong to Helen of Troy, but to Brad Pitt's Achilles!<p>This is because the most striking-looking person, very much on purpose as a superblond, is Brad-illes. I had heard that he gave up smoking and worked out in order to be buff enough to be Achilles. Well, the only other movie I ever saw Brad in was "Legends of the Fall", of which I have an imperfect memory, so I'm almost coming to Brad sight-unseen. Therefore, I can say with perfect candor that he's great!<p>I had my doubts about this movie, I had to admit. But I was pleasantly surprised at how much I did like it. Is it a movie for purists, though? Oh, no, not in the least. It's been twenty years since I read the Iliad, but even I can tell what's not true to the text here here.<p>1. No gods anywhere in sight. A good chunk of the original poem concerns all the machinations of the gods behind (or is it above?) the scenes. Not a breath of that here. Brad-illes makes some comments about the gods, quite reminiscent of how Kevin Sorbo's Hercules character says disparaging things about Hera. Of course, any time a movie has tried to show the gods, it just looks SO dopey; think "Clash of the Titans" and feel yourself blush. So, to dispense with that whole set of characters not only saved paychecks but also face. But the subliminal message I think is that the gods are hooey--no amount of worship, sacrifice, whatever, is of any avail. It's rather nihilistic in feel. Good people die and bad people triumph, if only for a while.<p>2. Characters die here who don't die at Troy. I guess it would be wrong to say just who, but let me put it this way: At a "trial by combat" kind of scene in the very beginning, a character got slain whom I know for a fact is still alive enough to get a visit from Odysseus in "The Odyssey". Once this happened, I said to myself, TutorGal anything's possible in this here movie! Then there's a big climax scene, when a woman character is being sexually threatened by another Major Character, and she kills him--even though he gets his own play and a different kind of hosing in his legendary bath later on. <p>3. Other characters don't even appear at all. Like the famous Cassandra, who says in effect "Hey, I wouldn't bring that big wooden horse in here if I were you!" And her mother, Hecuba, who Hamlet takes on about in one of his soliloquys. I guess the story held together without them, but I did miss them.<p>There's probably a lot of other stuff too, like the Great Balls of Fire (gotta go see it to find out what that means), that aren't in the source material, but still and all, I think it worked well enough.  <p>Some other reviewers take umbrage at the casting, but I don't think there are any problems on that score. Brad looks rather surfer-ish in some respects, but he's not as All-American as others would paint him. He's shown to be a not-very-pleasant person, chuck full-o anger. I found him believable enough.<p>Yeah, Helen is something of a nonentity, but my rationale on that is that it was necessary to have a very young woman play Helen if your Paris were going to be Orlando Bloom, who seems like a high schooler in many respects. They match well agewise. I also think that to play a different kind of Helen, a more seductive kind, you'd need a much older actress, say about 35, who knew her own sexuality very well. But if there were a Helen like that, King Priam would have given her the heave-ho because she'd have known the repercussions of her actions too well to be forgiven.<p>Speaking of King Priam, Peter O'Toole is one of my favorites this time around. Once famous as a Golden Boy himself 40 years ago, now Sir PO'T sports his white hair very elegantly. When he sees the 1,000 ships sailing right for his beach, he did what I call "face acting"--he decided to show fear and alarm by making his face long. A trick worthy of the late great Olivier himself--had to lean over to tell my companion, "Looks like he's opening up his can of ham!"  There's a very strange encounter between him and Brad-illes towards the end of the movie, where Brad almost seems frightened of him, continually moving away from him. But since PO'T is a rather looming sort of person, I rather got the feeling that Brad was afraid that PO'T was going to plant a big wet kiss on him if he wasn't careful.<p>Lots of fighting and dying by an incredibly large cast, but rather quick and well edited so you're not too shocked by the proceedings.  <p>In sum, I had a good old time at "Troy" -- it's a summer action film that delivers enough thrills and, with the right audience, laughs to make you smirk as you leave the theater. High art? No. Fun? Certainly is!</p></br><a href="../users/A26A64X86VL1R4.html">A26A64X86VL1R4</a><br/><p>This gorgeous film portrays a portion of Homer's Iliad, Achilles' story. Brad Pitt plays Achilles and brings to life this ancient warrior.  Despite no overt manifestation of the gods, Pitt manages to convey possession by the god of war or possesion by the warrior archetype in his body language and facial expression.  His intense physicalization of the role is typical of Pitt's talent and dedication to studying and learning a character.<br /><br />The crux of the matter is that Achilles is not a likeable character in the original.  He was a great warrior but he was childish and petulant.  In the movie they emphasize his lust for glory.  His pride and lack of impulse control exemplifies the dark side of the heroic which manifested in other great Greek heroes such as Hercules and Medea.  This heroic dark side is often ignored in modern heroic portrayal and leads to problems in our society.<br /><br />Pitt and Peterson did not flinch from portraying this darkness and in the process provided a portrait of the ugliness of war which I find psychologically useful in this modern era of war.  Achilles is balanced by the excellent and sympathetic portrayal of Hector by Eric Bana.  Continuing the theme of the problematic nature of war is the portrayal of Agammenon as a cynical warmonger who manipulates others in order to achieve his goal of hegemony.<br /><br />Of note is the wonderful acting performance in the portrayal of King Priam by O'Toole. One of the best scenes of the movie is where Priam goes to Achilles to beg for the body of his son.  The interaction/chemistry between the two actors was savory.  Both Pitt and O'Toole clearly have studied Homer's version and provide a poignant scene which underscores the tragedy of war.<br /><br />While this movie departs from the original I find it to be a satisfying and beautiful modernization of the story--certainly there is nothing to compare it to since nothing quite like this has been attempted in film.  My only complaint might be that I would have liked an attempt to portray the gods.  But perhaps the absence of gods is apt in our literal modern age where nature is de-sacralized and we put the gods in the service of our wars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Based on Homer's Illiad, there is an ironic connection to how this movie was received.  Some may have been wary of another big-budget Hollywood production, and thought of the classic proverb, "beware those who would bring false gifts."  The concern was unwarranted, as this movie is stunning in every way from beginning to end, and PACKED with major players from the ultimate battle movies.  Warriors from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q6GX5Y">300</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000654ZK0">The Lord of the Rings</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX95">Braveheart</a> all do battle in one movie!<br /><br />Agamemnon (Brian Cox - who was awesome in Braveheart as Argyle Wallace and showed enough range to be hilarious as Captain O'Hagan in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKMN">Super Troopers</a>) is a power hungry king who has challenged enough other kings to control most of Greece.  The only land that stands in his way of controlling the Aegean is Troy, ruled by pacifist-leaning Priam (Peter O'Toole).  Boromir from LOTR (Sean Bean) - plays Odysseus, a sycophant king to the now ruler of kings, Agamemnon.  Odysseus just happens to be a mentor and friend to the greatest warrior ever, Achilles (Pitt).  Fighting alongside Achilles is his second-in-command, Eudorus (Vincent Regan).  You will recognize him as the guy who was awesome as Leonidas's captain in 300.<br /><br />As peace is being worked out between Agamemnon's Greek forces and the emerging armies of Troy, two Trojan princes are treated as guests by Agamemnon: Prince Hector (Eric Bana) is his land's greatest warrior; and Prince Paris (Orlando Bloom aka Legolas from LOTR) is his younger, "Don Juan" brother.  When they leave they have an extra passenger, Helen (Diane Kruger) - who is now "of Troy" but was once "of Sparta" - and the peace being discussed is destroyed because she just happens to be married to King Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson - Hamish Campbell from Braveheart), Agamemnon's brother.  Now disgraced, Menelaus gives Agamemnon the reason he needed for war with Troy, a previously unbreached city thought undefeatable.  And, just for good measure, the rugged Campbell father from Braveheart plays Glaucus (James Cosmo), a top soldier in the Trojan Army.<br /><br />If all this is confusing, don't worry; the movie is still great.  Enjoy the epic war scenes similar to the movies from which they have borrowed cast members, tragically snicker at the fact that you know what the "Trojan Horse" is all about (and that the city of Troy falls to such a ridiculous trick), and revel in a classic sword battle between Achilles and Hector.  Actually, try not to enjoy one battle more than others, because this movie is saturated with great action like Achilles' complete domination of the monstrous Thessalian warrior Boagrius (Nathan Jones aka Petr from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SM6FLI">The Condemned</a>).<br /><br />From beginning to end this movie is superb.  The lighting, acting, scenery, musical score, costume design and casting all reflect impressively on the entire movie's efforts.  I didn't care to go too much into the historical aspect of the movie, but from what I can tell all the major details fairly consistent with the truth.  This is right up there with 300 and Braveheart, and is a can't miss action flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SCD2NYTIAQTY.html">A1SCD2NYTIAQTY</a><br/><p>"Troy" was a bit of a fizzer the first time I saw it, actually. With Brad Pitt trying to pull off Achilles, and some pretty sickening, almost Australian accents in some of the actors, it was a fairly mediocre experience all round. This was not helped by my suspicions it would be complete crap with all the big names in it. However, after watching the movie for a second passing, it started to endear itself to me.<br /><br />Brad Pitt was still a bit of a miscast Achilles, and Peter O'Toole an odd choice for Priam, the King of Troy, but the bad guys were very well cast, I thought. Agamemnon and Menalaus were both brilliantly portrayed in all of their warlike savagery. Orlando Bloom seemed more plastic than normal as Paris, second prince of Troy, and the lover of Helen.<br /><br />On the plus side, the cinematography was simply superb, and when the CGI was used to assist, it was of very high quality. The overall visual effects were exception, from the sets used right through to the battle scenes.<br /><br />The special features in this edition are fairly good, and well worth the look themselves. I found them informative and interesting, though unless you are a "The Making of..." geek like me, you might want to pass on them.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is not the best I have seen, of course, but for a big budget, Hollywood production with the big name stars, it is not too bad at all. I could easily sit through an additional viewing or two and not be spending too much time eating.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AP6H48QHX8BR.html">A3AP6H48QHX8BR</a><br/><p>Troy surprised me based on some of the reviews being portrayed online and the newspaper. Mind you-it's not the best way to spend almost three hours of your life but, it's not the worst either. Rarely is a movie done that guys and girls might both enjoy the guys will love the action fight scenes while the gals will swoon over Brad Pitt.<br /><br />This movie must have cost millions to make with the all-star cast, stunning costumes, the music, and thrilling fight scenes this movie did not fail to impress me and in my opinon it deserved some nodds from the oscars particulary concerning the accuracy and detail in the costumes.<br /><br />I can't believe how many people were critcising the fact that the movie strayed from the "Illiad" personally I thought this was a good thing considering I had to suffer reading that book in high-school. The movie is actually in my opinon better than the book which strains the borriness and pettiness of the Gods who decide the fate of the doomed city. It also was not just based on the Illiad but I saw refrences from the Aenid as well(The Roman version of the Illiad). And yes the Trojan war lasted twelve years I believe and in this it lasts a period of a couple of months.<br /><br />The cast does a very good job particularly from Eric Bana and Brad Pitt. Peter O'Toole also did great as King Priam an actually honorable king. I however was not impressed by Orlando and can find the only reason why he has made it into acting is his pretty face. Sorry Girls- he's a model not an actor! But, you will not notice him when you have such performances from cuties Brad and Bana!<br /><br />This movie is all about, love, honor, and immortality. With great action squences and wonderful love scenes- this is a movie to rent on movie night. The only thing I have to critcize about this movie and the only reason this flick didn't recieve four stars from me would have to be the melodramatic screenplay which in my opinon ruined what would have been a great film.<br /><br />This is one of those movies I would rent for movie night, but not buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A16FUU8WW76QFY.html">A16FUU8WW76QFY</a><br/><p>I really did look forward to "Troy", Wolfgang Peterson's epic version of the Iliad.  Alas, there is some good, and some bad in the monumental production ($200 million) of the Greek vs. Trojan saga. Overall I was disappointed.<br /><br />Did I mention that it is huge?  There are vast numbers of computer generated soldiers, 1000 Greek warships, and gigantic fortifications of Troy, the city under siege.  Somehow I just don't think this is what Homer had in mind when he wrote the epic poem more than 3,000 years ago.  It all looks pretty, but the film has no soul.<br /><br />A buffed-out Brad Pitt plays the legendary Greek warrior Achilles, but somehow the ancient Rambo just doesn't fit his style.  He seems like a pufferfish trying to fill the big shoes of this historic giant.  Pitt is a superb actor, but I agree with the critics who've stated that he is miscast in the role.  The one fellow who does very well in this film is Eric Bana, who gives his portrayal of the Trojan hero Hector a real conscience.  Hector sees what is coming, but his stature among the Trojan nobility means duty comes first-whatever the cost.  The other characters such as Paris (Orlando Bloom) and Helen (Diane Kruger) are again physically attractive and uninteresting at the same time.  Peter O'Toole's King Priam says 'It is the will of the Gods' an awful lot.<br /><br />The story is by now well known to just about anyone who can read.  Let's just say that the interaction between mortal and gods in the book are dispensed with in favor of man vs. man conflict.  The romance between Paris and Helen, which is what is supposed to have started the war in the first place, is largely shunted aside in favor of the huge battle scenes-there is virtually no chemistry between Bloom and Kruger.<br /><br />The battle scenes are well done, but after awhile one begins to wonder if that is all there is to this film (my wife did).  I expected great things from "Troy", but got a lot of swords, spears, shields and arrows.  Did I say this movie is huge?  2 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>MAGNIFICENT TO BEHOLD, WITH SOME REALLY FINE ACTING TO BOOT, 'TROY', despite some really negative barbs from the usual boring critics, is a real epic spectacular!  wondrous to behold, breathtaking in it's vastness and scope, i along with a theatre full of people seemed extremely satisfied by mr. petersen's intrepretation (historians need not apply)! it really is awesome to see in all of it's screen wonders, some really fine performances, esp. mr. pitt, mr. bloom, and especially eric banas. it is also a joy to see the late peter o'toole and julie christie again. if you want 3 hours of eye popping visuals, some really splendid battle sequences, you will not go wrong with :TROY:.  we loved it and are eagerly awaiting the dvd release tuesday, 1/4!  it's an epic not to be missed.  happy new year to all.</p></br><a href="../users/A17JVVAKWEB0M.html">A17JVVAKWEB0M</a><br/><p>Trojan Prince Paris visits Spartan ruler Menelaus and returns to Troy with the Spartan's wife, Helen.  Thus begins one of history's most famous tales, as the Spartans and Greeks load up the boats and sail across the Aegean Sea toward Troy, to retrieve the woman who literally launched a thousand ships.<br /><br />"Troy" focuses on one man, Achilles, on one of those ships.  Played by Brad Pitt, Achilles leads the men from the field, even though he is torn about whether thousands of men should die in order to return one woman to a man she left.  Filmed on the picturesque blazing beaches of Malta, "Troy" is full of action, love and a few too many shots of half-naked Pitt.<br /><br />Not as aesthetically ambitious as other historical epics like Braveheart or Saving Private Ryan, Troy is more concerned with telling a good story in the populist sense. It is not a film for teachers of English or History to use as an example of what is known about the Trojan War; those familiar with Homer's source material may be somewhat disappointed with the liberties taken (even though Homer took some himself). The film is essentially an inaccurate re-telling of a story we know is already full of inaccuracies.<br /><br />But holding up this film to the original work of Homer misses the point entirely. The filmmakers knew an accurate depiction would be impossible to make and even more impossible to sell. They borrow the spirit from The Iliad and transform it into a modern action film. In doing so, director Wolfgang Peterson creates a film that will thrill and captivate the same viewers that would never see the version Homer intended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3SXHT6RBV81.html">A2F3SXHT6RBV81</a><br/><p>This lavish war movie took us back 3,200 years ago to discover the truth about the legend of Achilles' heel. The scenes were similar to the primitive fight of our Civil War. The Trojan War was vast and destructive (as was the War Between the States in America); the Colonial Wars were just as bad. At least there was no scalping of prisoners or dead warriors as portrayed in Coyle's SAVAGE WILDERNESS. However, it was not an easy thing to see. Parts of the movie were shot in Mexico; the female vocal was performed by someone named Tanya. Johnny Mathis sang "Remember." The musical director was the marvelous James Horner of TITANTIC fame. War and horror movies depend on the orchestral mood-setting music, and this was no exception. At times, it was spectacular like the sunrise there in Mexico.<br /><br />Based on Homer's THE ILIAD, the saga is updated to 2004 sexual propensities. The nude scenes were not needed in such a movie, only lower the integrity of Homer's classic. The gladiators may have used primitive weapons, such as spears, shields, bows & arrows (they did play dirty using the fire arrows), and I like the nose guards on their helmets. The Trojans were dressed in gray, as they invaded. They loved a spectacle, sometimes fighting without shields. They trampled their own dead in retreat, with some revenge killings. At least, the dead were not left on the field (sand) for the vultures and given a burial pyre where they fell. There were many such death pyres similar to India's tradition. The final was an indoor flame for Hector, the real star of this saga, when the funeral games lasted twelve days.<br /><br />The fleet of ancient boats was quite spectacular. There was pandemonium in the streets (larger scale than in PIRATES OF PENZANCE in which Linda Ronstadt and Kevin Kline starred) as the fleet approached. There was mass slaughter inside the walls of the city and the fires turned it into a huge funeral pyre. Now, this is the film in which the Rock should have starred. Brad Pitt made a valiant effort. He looked silly, however, in a skirt; his outfits influenced this summer's skimpy styles for women. He looked like a woman with that hair style (bleached blonde to boot). He was a mean (though not lean) fighting machine.<br /><br />Jewelry was abundant on men with earrings and gold ornaments in their long hair. The women (except for Achilles mother) wore lavish jewels -- even the slave girl loved by Achilles (who turned out to be a real princess), was cousin of Hector. The old king, with his ugly teeth, played by Peter O'Toole was humanly portrayed as the father of two handsome sons: Hector married with a blue-eyed son (even Trojan babies suched their thumbs) and Paris who caused all this havoc by stealing the young wife, Helen, who just wanted a man she could grow old with. Her Greek husband was old enough to be her father. Women were used merely as chattal for sex and pro-creation, not much love involved. Achilles slept with women but he loved his male cousin. When the cousin gave his life (dressed as Achilles), a vendetta took place. Hector wasd a fool who thought he'd killed Achilles but revenge caused his death and his body was dragged thtough the desert tied to Achilles' chariot. The old king appealed for his son's body; consequently, we see the Trojan horse and the vermin who escaped to open the gates for a new, massive fleet of Greek warriors to wreck havoc.<br /><br />There were gorgeous horses in the seaside camp on the Trojan Beach. Thank God they freed the horses from the final inferno. The nudity was bad and totally unnecessary. There was a bevy of belly dancers at the feast in Sparta. At Phtia, there was a type of Stonehenge where Achilles practiced sword play with his cousin. His weakness was the sword through his heel as he could not walk, run, or fight back. As he cried before he died, I thought, "So, he was human after all, not just a killing monstrosity." He could find peace only in death.<br /><br />There was plunder as spoils of war. During the twelve-day reprieve, one of the Greek men was shown carving a stone horse with a sharp knife "for my son back home." I guess he got it, as there was a final victory with the Trojans being defeated. It does no good to be sorry 'after the fact.' We're all human, and humans make mistakes -- sometimes fatal. This extra-long movie (music kept it going) showed that even enemies can show respect. When Achilles "frees" the woman who loves him to return to her people (not caring how he hurts her), it parodies the old adage: "You Always Hurt The One You Love."</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>This is one of those big budget movies that lives up to the hype.  Beautifully filmed and full of action and romance, it has a little bit of everything to satisfy everyone.  Brad Pitt does a nice job as Achilles, a feared warrior who is battling his own demons and filled with repulsion for the King he serves.  Eric Bana (coming off the film, The Hulk) also gives a good performance as Hector, Achilles' foe, a good man that is caught up in fighting for his homeland and the honor of his family.  Orlando Bloom plays Paris, who's stealing Helen from the King of Sparta, sets the story in motion.  For me, though, it is the conflict between Hector and Achilles that is the most interesting part of the film.  The cinematography is beautiful and all the actors do well in their roles.  I highly recommend this film!</p></br><a href="../users/A1G9FX1KV45N41.html">A1G9FX1KV45N41</a><br/><p>When Paris of Troy (Orlando Bloom) visits Sparta, he and the lovely  Queen Helen (played by that exquisite human being Diane Kruger - whose face certainly could launch a thousand ships)elope.<br />The problem is that she is the wife of the brutal King of Sparta, Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson)<br />When he spirits Helen back with him to Troy, Menelaus vows revenge, including to tear Helen apart with his own hands.

The champion of the Greeks is the invincible warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt), who hates Agamemnon, but his come to fight to immortalize his own name, in line with the prophecy by his seer mother.<br /><br />Brad Pitt did pull off his role as Achilles, though I was skeptical whether he would BEFORE the movie.<br />Though he was not as good as Eric Bana in his superb and thoughtful portrayal of Hector.<br />Three notable roles by three beautiful women.

The Hulk's Eric Bana is utterly fantastic in here. When he and Brad Pitt battle it out, it is classic, vintage fighting the likes of Kill Bill's Quentin Tarintino would salivate for.<br /><br />This is by far director Wolfgang Peterson's finest film to date.

While the Trojan war is thought to be a historical event, much of the details in Homer were the stuff of legend, not history.<br /><br />Eric Bana and Brad Pitt are both buffed up and believable as Greek warriors.  I was skeptical of Pitt being cast as Achilles, but he turned out a surprisingly good performance.  Peter O'Toole is a natural as Priam, and Orlando Bloom plays Paris as every bit the wimp he is in the ILIAD.<br /><br />To be sure, the writers took a great many liberties in the storyline.  However, this made for a nice and cohesive plot.  In particular, I was impressed by the clever way in which they re-wrote the duel between Paris and Menelaous, as well as their blowing up the character of Chrysalias into a major & pivotal persona.  In Homer we barely get to know her at all.<br /><br />After seeing the film, some friends of mine complained that Achilles was not likeable enough.  Actually, the Achilles in TROY is far more likeable than the one in Homer's epic.  In my mind, they did a great job of making him as likeable as possible without divorcing him from the character in Homer's poem.<br /><br />Eric Bana is remarkable as Hector.  Some people I know were surprised that he is depicted as in most ways more heroic than Achilles.  After all, Hector fights for all the right reasons.  This, too, is consistent with the ILIAD.  Also, TROY is a good name for the film as ILIAD alludes to Ilion, which was another name for Troy.<br /><br />As a nice bonus, there are some scenes from and allusions to Virgil's AENEID.  This makes the production value even more endearing to the viewer.<br /><br />Whether you have ever read Homer / Virgil or not, I would HIGHLY recommend this DVD.  It has a nice 2nd disc of special features that includes an overview of the Greek pantheon (although some detail on Homer would have been nice as well).  I would recommend both the movie AND the book.  I would also recommend watching HELEN OF TROY, which is a DVD that focuses on different aspects of the myth.</p></br><a href="../users/A33TBHM3O9AY17.html">A33TBHM3O9AY17</a><br/><p>I finally got around to watching this one over the weekend, and quite frankly, I enjoyed it immensely.  I was left with a profound hollowness in my gut when the film ended -- which is precisely the effect any worthwhile Greek tragedy should have.  I realize that most of this movie's loudest critics highlight its rather pronounced divergence from Homer's classic Greek epic, The Iliad, and they're correct.  However, I would remind viewers that this movie's credits include an appropriate disclaimer -- it is "inspired by" the Iliad, rather than "based on" it.  Those two words open up a broad range of artistic license, of which the producers obviously availed themselves.  Nevertheless, the main story line of the battle of Troy is readily identifiable.<br /><br />The story is not complicated.  Just when Sparta and Troy are trying to cement a peace treaty to end years of war between them, young Paris, a prince of Troy (an uninspired performance by Orlando Bloom), takes a shine to Helen, queen of Sparta and wife of its king, Menelaus.  When Helen chooses to return to Troy with Paris and his brother, the legendary Trojan general Hector (Eric Bana), Menelaus seeks the aid of his brother, Greek king Agamemnon, to get her back.  Agamemnon sees a golden opportunity to unite the strength of all the Greek kingdoms under his banner and to do the one thing which has always eluded him -- the capture of Troy.  Trojan king Priam (masterfully played by Peter O'Toole) accepts the risk of war and chooses to stand behind his sons, trusting in his gods and the walls of Troy to protect them.<br /><br />Helen's face does, indeed, launch a thousand ships, bearing to the shores of Troy the largest Greek army ever fielded.  The Greeks quickly find, however, that the Trojan walls are just as impregnable as they have always been, and that Hector's leadership is brilliant.  Agamemnon is forced to turn to his unpredictable and uncontrollable ally, the mighty warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt) and his band of Myrmidons.  Achilles brings a heroic dynamism and leadership to every battle, and literally makes the difference between victory and defeat for the giant Greek army.  In the many (very well done) battle scenes, Achilles reminds the viewer of a Cuisinart as he whirls and dances with deadly speed and precision among his enemies.<br /><br />But Achilles is a tormented man.  He is portrayed as the ultimate warrior, a veritable killing machine whose only code is death.  Legend has it that, as an infant, Achilles was dangled by his ankle and dipped into the River Styx, thereby becoming invulnerable to death.  Brad Pitt, in my opinion, did a fine acting job in this role, bringing depth and dimension to this complex character.  On the one hand, he is a cold ruthless killer, but on the other, he demonstrates a deep love, and grief, toward his young cousin Patroclus, and a strange tenderness and protectiveness toward Briseis, the young priestess he captures in an early battle.  He also shows an intense honor in his dealings with Priam and Hector, and even spares the life of a Trojan soldier who states simply, "Please, I have a son."  Frankly, this is probably the best role I have seen from Brad Pitt so far.<br /><br />The legends go on to tell of the Trojan Horse, and of Achilles' heel -- the one part of his body that wasn't dipped in the Styx.  Those legends play out forcefully and credibly on the screen, and leave the viewer struck by a deep sense of tragedy and loss as the story closes.  The entire film is one of heroism, nobility and action as the legends are brought vividly to life.  The settings and the battles are realistic and gritty, and the special effects are well done.  Maybe it's not true to Homer's original story, but if you can get past that I think you'll find that this is a wonderful tale in its own right.</p></br><a href="../users/A3A48XEYWLWH7T.html">A3A48XEYWLWH7T</a><br/><p>Tuesday, January 18, 2005 / 4 of 5 / Toiling in the Shadow of Jackson<br /><br />The Lord of the Rings trilogy has spoiled us and raised the bar for would be epics.  Without the spectre of Peter Jackson looming behind it, Troy would have been a lot more impressive.  Still, for its bright sandy sweep it is an enjoyable romp if one overlooks the departures from Homer's Iliad, particularly the time compression from 10 years to a week or so, and just enjoy the ride.  For those of us who have actually read the epic, there are well detailed `Hollywoodisms' that tend to detract more than Jackson's artistic license w/ Tolkien.  I was however pleased with the tragic hero treatment of Hektor, and thought Bana did a fine job.  The CG army clashes were frankly, paltry, compared to the ferocity of Helms Deep and Minis Tirith battles, but it was nice to have a lighter palette of the desert.  The cast did a good job, even if Brian Cox as Agamemnon was a somewhat unconvincing warrior leading his armies, he chewed scenes in the more personal dialogues.  I'm sure kids will clamor for this when they're assigned the Iliad in school, but bear in mind the differences and do take the time at least someday to read the first and arguably greatest epic story in Western civilization.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R9GZ8FC44MF5.html">A1R9GZ8FC44MF5</a><br/><p>I think Alexander will probably win the best pic oscar this year, but this is definetly a very close second.  Its really one of the best films ever made, and definetly one of the best this year.  Its alittle better then The Last Samurai but not much.  Gladiator is alittle better but again not much, this is very close to Gladiator but Alexander looks like it could be better then Gladiator.  Anyway back to this.  It has a great story, sure its different but its more interesting that way, why would you pay 10 bucks to see a movie about something youve heard a million times before.  Its got great very well choreographed fights (esspecially the one between Pitt and Bana, the climatic fight and the best part of the movie) and grand scale battles.  Its got an oscar caliber performance from Bana, and great performances by everyone else.  Its got great cinematography and visuals, a great score, and powerful drama.  Definetly a 10 out of a 10.  If you liked Gladiator then you should like this basically just as much, they are very close in terms of how great they are.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>It's about time that "the sword and sandal" film make a comeback and what a comeback "Troy" is!!! This is truly a film of grandeur that deserves to be called an epic. Wolfgang Peterson's masterful direction, James Horner's superb score, a very literate script and an outstanding cast, "Troy" takes its place with "Ben-Hur", "Spartacus", and "Gladiator" as one of the best of the genre.<br /><br />For those critical of Pitt's performance as "Achilles", I say that the actor shows that he possesses the acting "muscle" to coincide with the beefed up physique for this challenging role. Eric Bana's is quite sympathetic as "Hector", a prince of Troy forced into battle because of younger brother Paris's (Orlando Bloom) obsession with the beautiful, and very much married, "Helen" of Sparta (the visually-stunning Dianne Kruger).<br /><br />Veterans Peter O'Toole ("King Priam") and Brian Cox (the power-hungry "Agamemnon") are brilliant in their respective roles. Bloom's "Lord of the Rings" co-star Sean Bean is also effective as "Odysseus", brainchild behind the infamous Trojan horse of historical fame.<br /><br />And any movie that features the classy Julie Christie in the small yet memorable role of Pitt's "mom" is destined for greatness.<br /><br />"Troy" may run almost three hours but it's time well spent.<br /><br />I, for one, can't wait for the DVD. I'm sure that any deleted footage will be a treat just like the version currently being seen in cinemas worldwide.</p></br><a href="../users/A11KRMIA0ES88I.html">A11KRMIA0ES88I</a><br/><p>Michael and I watched this on TV from our room in New York City. I tried to explain it to him and to myself. It is from the Iliad written by the Greek poet Homer. Ilium is a word for Troy. Trojan Paris seduced Helen, the wife of King Menelaus of Greece. The Greeks sacked Troy, using a wooden horse to enter the city. Brad Pitt is Achilles, the Greek hero who kills Hector. Achilles dies when Paris shoots an arrow into his heel. Michael asked if the part about the horse was true. I said the story is half true and half made up. The Trojan War was fought around 1200 B.C. Homer lived around 800 B.C.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>This film pretty much follows the story with very few exceptions and possible ending. However the few exceptions and ending is what makes this story work as a movie instead of a long poem. Stories being told may ways have different insights and there should be no conflict between the reader and viewer and both stories are real to the observer.<br /><br />For you that forgot the story and you that know the story well but have not seen this movie basically we are looking at a story that you may or may not have had an opportunity to sidestep in school but can never have a grasp on social history with out it. Some call it real and lost in antiquity. Others say that Homer had a Good imagination. And others treat it as an allegory with a historical background.<br /><br />Brad Pitt who has played fickle people before is excellent in the part of Achilles and is sort of a heel. Nothing less was expected. It was the other actors that played their parts so well that you forgot you were watching the movie.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------<br />Two Trojan princes are the guests of the Spartan ruler Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson). While Menelaus is preoccupied with other matters he leaves his wife, Helen of Sparta (Diane Kruger), to her own devises. The younger Trojan prince Paris (Orlando Bloom) is left alone to many times with Helen and decides against everyone else's better judgment to make her Helen of Troy and thus pilfers her from Menelaus.<br /><br />As a husband Menelaus is of course miffed. However his brother the Greek king Agamemnon (Brian Cox) sees this as an opportunity to absorb Troy into his territory. Natural this spawns a war in which Agamemnon recruits Achilles an extremely gifted and charmed warrior. Achilles goes to make a name for him self. He brings his cronies, and his cousin. Together they do many bold and callous things.<br /><br />I will not go into the details of the war as you either know or will soon know the details. However I will say that I thought that the Trojan horse was well and realistically designed. And you may want to pay attention to the background music as it is relevant to the film.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NA1W36">Seven Years in Tibet [Blu-ray</a>]</p></br><a href="../users/A2T2MYZEB81NOQ.html">A2T2MYZEB81NOQ</a><br/><p>I like this movie a lot. In fact, I come close to loving it. The battle scenes between the Greeks and the Trojans were super-everything from the throwing of spears to the swinging of swords to the firing of arrows to the catapulting of fireball rocks. Oh and there was plenty of blood, too(Niiiiccccceee!)Blood flying everywhere-in pints! Wicked. Achilles, by the way, was my favorite character. Brad Pitt did him superbly and Hector was in close second place, as Eric Bana played him like a dream and he showed that just as Achilles was the Greek of all Greeks, Hector was the Trojan of all  Trojans. All of this is true as far as I'm concerned. On top of that, Helen was wicked sexy and more beautiful than any woman I've seen in any movie, and King Priam was  very brave for someone who did little fighting. However, despite that, and the fact that the Trojan Horse was built very well, I did not like Paris very much. He was a coward and a wimp. But other than that, this movie rocks!</p></br><a href="../users/A16IXZW2A0NFR6.html">A16IXZW2A0NFR6</a><br/><p>This movie really has one major flaw...which would be prettified blonde Gap ad Brad Pitt. I've liked him in other movies in the past but here he just seems lost in his character and overwhemed by the stories scope. Eric Bana makes this movie watchable, I feel bad for him for ending up in flops like this and The Hulk because he is actually a decent actor. Orlando Bloom whines like a 3 year old girl the entire film and proves he has little resonace onscreen when he actually has to speak. The cinemotography is excellent and the rest of the supporting cast is good, but there still isn't anything too memorable going on here, this movie could have been a whole lot better, but it could also have been worse.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Wolfgang Peterson`s "Troy" is an attempt to recapture the look and feel of those sword-and-sandal epics of the 1950's and 1960's - those multi-million dollar, wide screen extravaganzas that helped lure audiences away from their television sets at home and back into the movie houses they had so recently abandoned.  As is to be expected, "Troy" shares many of the strengths as well as many of the weaknesses of those earlier films.<br /><br />On the positive side, "Troy" provides us with the pleasure of watching history (or pseudo-history in this case) unfolding on a grand scale with events greater than ourselves being enacted on the screen.  It also boasts spectacular battle sequences with thousands of extras (or the computerized equivalent thereof) stretching back as far as the eye can see.  On the negative side, the movie suffers from over length, corny dialogue and banal characters who frequently get lost on the vast canvas of the film.  The good news is that, for the most part, "Troy" manages to triumph over most of its weaknesses.<br /><br />"Troy" is based very loosely on "The Iliad," the epic poem by the Greek writer, Homer.  So loose is it, in fact, that the screenplay dispenses completely with the gods and goddesses who play so crucial a role in the original tale and, instead, concentrates exclusively on the humans who are left on their own to act out the drama.  Those characters read like a Who's Who of great mythological figures.  On the Greek side, we have Achilles, the pouty warrior who sits out most of the fighting because he feels personally slighted by the king who doesn`t appreciate him the way he should; Agamemnon, the arrogant chieftain who is more concerned with personal glory than with doing what is right; Menelaus, the impulsive cuckold who has no compunction about taking his nation to war over a personal humiliation; Odysseus, the pragmatic fighter who tries his hardest to get Achilles to see the error of his ways; and Patroclus, the impetuous youth eager to prove his mettle and his devotion to Achilles on the field of battle.  Lined up on the Trojan side are Hector, the sensitive tactician; Priam, the wise king and loving father of Hector and Paris; Paris, the callow youth; and Helen, the world`s most beautiful woman, for whose sake the epic battle is ultimately fought.  In fact, it is Paris` "abduction" of Helen from her Greek husband, Menelaus, that inspires that nation to launch a thousand ships, cross the sea to the fortified city of Troy, and do battle with the Trojans.<br /><br />Because of the quality of the source material, "Troy" boasts a slightly more complex and conflicted hero than we are used to finding in action/adventure films.  For even though he is reputed to be the world's most invincible warrior, Achilles is also petulant and spoiled, quick to anger and often more concerned with amending personal injuries than with safeguarding the welfare of his own countrymen.  The squaring off between the two bitter rivals, Achilles and Hector - two men who, under different circumstances, might have been the best of friends - is excitingly well done and suspenseful.  Ditto for the scene in which a mourning King Priam slips into the tent of his enemy to beg for the body of his son.  On the other hand, Achille's love affair with the Trojan "war prize" Breseis emerges as pure Hollywood hokum.  And poor Agamemnon has become far more of a conventional villain in this version than he is in "The Iliad."<br /><br />Although the screenplay stays relatively faithful to the broad outlines of "The Iliad"'s storyline and characters, it can't duplicate the beauty and soul of Homer's poetic verse.  The closest the writers seem to be able to come is having the characters repeat over and over again to one another that men for thousands of years will still be speaking of Achilles, Hector, Troy, et. al. and the events in which they are engaged.  All this pretentious, self-reverential speechifying merely succeeds in throwing us out of the drama every time someone utters one of those "prophetic" lines.<br /><br />Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom, Brian Cox, Eric Bana, Diane Kruger, Rose Byrne and Sean Bean round out the cast, but it is the veteran actor Peter O'Toole who, as Priam, delivers the one truly compelling performance.  It's also nice to see Julie Christie in a movie again, although her role as the sea nymph, Thetis, Achilles' mother, is too inconsequential for her to have much of an impact.<br /><br />"Troy" is little more than an Illustrated Highlights version of "The Iliad," but for those unfamiliar with the work, it serves as a decent enough introduction for those willing to take on the real thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A39NS429FYXAD1.html">A39NS429FYXAD1</a><br/><p>This impressive looking production is long on action, special effects and beautiful male bodies but is just plain awful when it comes to story.  The Gods are surely NOT smiling.  It's like the Aaron Spelling version of the Trojan War.  "The Silly-iad."<br /><br />That said, TROY remains a heckuva fun way to spend a couple hours if you go in for epic matinee thrill rides.  It's just too bad Paris and Helen have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever...if they did, you could almost understand why a war was waged.  And Achilles's love interest directly feeds the warped notion that prisoners should fall in love with their captors.  Brad Pitt as Achilles is earnest and physically impressive, but he and the kid playing his lookalike cousin still seem like they walked onto the set straight from the Santa Monica pier.  Bana is much more in command of his role as warrior prince.  Poor Peter O'Toole as Priam turns in the second worst performance of his career (Did you ever see SUPERGIRL?).<br /><br />The DVD special features are lots of fun.  Too bad they couldn't have had some knowledgeable historian from the A&E Network do a commentary track to go along with it...would have been interesting to have that perspective.<br /><br />A feast for the eyes.  Just hit the mute button and enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A146D2LYLICNLS.html">A146D2LYLICNLS</a><br/><p>Upon seeing the trailer for this movie I had expected a lot more than what was delivered. This is simply an average movie in every aspect. I actually like Brad Pitt as an actor; he can do a good job when he is cast for the right movie (ie: "12 Monkeys and "Se7en"). But I'm sorry, he was unconvincing as Achilles. Yeah, he obviously spent some major time at the gym for this role and admittedly he looks impressive physically. But in terms of *emotion* and acting in the role he leaves much to be desired.<p>The fight scenes are mediocre at best and become repetitive after the first one. Both armies stare each other down-run towards each other while screaming-collide-throats are slashed and chests are impaled (one very large fighter needs to be impaled twice before he dies, just for the added shock value and drama)-armies retreat and lick their wounds-Brad Pitt is shown all sweaty and covered in the blood of the men he killed-Brad Pitt washes himself (one almost expects him to turn to the camera, hold up a bottle of the newest shampoo and start talking about how it leaves your hair silky smooth without any buildup)-army sleeps while Brad Pitt gets a little action-next day another battle. Repeat as necessary throughout the movie.<p>But I don't mean to knock the battle sequences all that much. The fight between Achilles and Hector is great, and might very well be worth the price of admission. Pitt and Bana actually work at it.<p>And Diane Kruger who plays Helen of Troy is definitely gorgeous and nice to look at, even if she's a one-dimentional cardboard cutout of a character. Not her fault. Blame the film-makers for that.<p>All in all, don't expect much from this movie other than mild entertainment. It's all style and little substance. For a much better viewing experience of a movie in the same genre watch "Gladiator." That leaves "Troy" in the dust.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Roger Ebert actually called this movie a tie as the worst film of the year next to Alexandre. I don't see where it's that bad at all though. Brad Pitt looks better in the part of his character than Colin Farrel does in Alexandre. He's no Russel Crowe in Gladiator but still I think he does fine in the part. It's just hard to root for his character though because he's clearly fighting for the wrong team. He just wants to go down in history as a great warrior pretty much so can really careless who he's fighting.  He has no real desire to fight in a war that's mostly over a women but he is in it just for the victory and fame and...his ego. He changes a little but still he still chooses to fight on the wrong side and to kill nice innocent people.<br /><br />  The trailers make Eric Bana (Black Hawk Down) look bad and  Brad Pitt's character look like this great hero but really it's the other way around. Eric Bana plays this passionate guy who's just really fighting to defend his family and Kingdom. Pitt is just fighting for him and the glory eventhough he does have a heart in there somewhere. He never gets you to care for him as much as you do for Russel Crowe in Gladiator.  Bana even makes your care for him more and is a lot more likeable than Pitt is.<br /><br />  The supporting cast is fantastic too, Brian Coxx  (X-Men 2, Manhunter) plays a crazed leader who wants to just conquare Troy. He doesn't care that his brother's wife left him for the prince of Troy and isn't fighting because of that. Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings) is fine as the Prince of Troy who's love is too strong for Helen to allow her to go back to avoid war. Peter O'Toole is also excellent as the King of Troy who just wanted peace. He shows he can still act and I think he should even be nominated for Best Supporting actor. Sean Bean (The Lord of the Rings) is also good in a small role as Pitt's friend who gets him to go into battle with him. Movies like this always show that he deserves better than to be always casted as a villain from  Ireland in bad movies. The movie is  very involving with great sword-play and intense battles. Just have to be able to sit through good people getting killed a lot and the movie dragging on a little.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>According to Homer, Paris stole Helen from King Menelaus of Sparta. More than 4,000 years later, Peter O'Toole steals this film with one of his most thoughtful and sensitive performances in a supporting role as Priam, King of Troy. Thanks to modern digital technologies, the battle scenes are terrific. Most of the cast members are OK and I think director Wolfgang Petersen was wise to omit various gods and goddesses which Robert Wise saw fit to include in Helen of Troy (1955). Pitt is generally credible as the hubristic, athletic, sullen, and lethal Achilles...at least until he opens his mouth. Troy's greatest warrior, Hector, requires more than Eric Bana delivers. (I got the distinct feeling that Bana's Hector would be more comfortable in a cardigan sweater, smoking a pipe, than in armor and carving up opponents with a sword.) Sean Bean is quietly effective as Ulysses. It was a bold decision and, I think, a wrong one to have Orlando Bloom portray Paris as a confused wimp throughout most of the film. (I am not alone when reacting "She ran off with HIM?") Petersen gives Diane Kruger (as Helen) little to do which I also think was a mistake. Indeed, others in supporting roles are essentially decorative. Julie Christie appearing briefly as Thetis, for example. However, O'Toole's performance and the action scenes (including the plundering and destruction of Troy) enhance this otherwise unremarkable film. Also noteworthy is the revelation of Agamemnon's motives. Raging with righteous indignation, he publicly demands justice after his sister-in-law is "stolen" by Paris. He  organizes and leads an invasion force to reunite Helen with her husband. However, what we soon realize is that Agamemnon really wants Troy's wealth and, of even greater importance, Spartan control of the trade routes. This film lacks the depth, nuance, edge, and cohesion of other epics such as Lawrence of Arabia, Spartacus, and even Gladiator but it does provide entertainment sufficient to earn a Four Star rating by this reviewer.</p></br><a href="../users/A22J9WI2PDAVJ.html">A22J9WI2PDAVJ</a><br/><p>"Troy" is pure entertainment.

With that much tension in the air, I was waiting for Achilles to take down King Agamemnon at any time.<br /><br /> The movie flows well for the two-hour length.

Screenwriter David Benioff claims Homer's "The Iliad" as inspiration, but "Troy" actually incorporates details from several ancient sources, including "The Odyssey" and probably the "Little Iliad" or "Sack of Ilion", both written a little later. "The Iliad" only covers a short period of time in the Trojan War, and begins a decade into the conflict. "Troy" reduces the war to what seems like only a few weeks, keeps most of "The Iliad"'s principle characters, but changes some of their actions and motivations.<br /><br />"Troy" maintains the traditional cause of the Trojan War: While on a diplomatic visit to Sparta, in Greece, young Prince Paris of Troy (Orlando Bloom) falls in love with King Menalaus' wife, the lovely Helen (Diane Kruger), who incites the wrath of her husband (Brendan Gleeson) by accompanying Paris back to Troy, across the sea. King Menalaus of Sparta implores his brother, King Agamemnon (Brian Cox), an ambitious and ruthless military leader who has managed to force all of the Greek city-states into a loose confederation under his rule, to raise a Greek army to attack Troy. Agamemnon is only too happy to have an excuse to conquer Troy, but needs Greek's greatest warrior, Achilles (Brad Pitt) to commit to the war. Achilles hates Agamemnon, but when his friend Odysseus (Sean Bean), the clever King of Ithaca, appeals to his vanity, Achilles cannot refuse the  opportunity for immortality that the great war will bring its heroes. In Troy, King Priam (Peter O'Toole) is confident that his city walls will withstand a Greek attack. His eldest son, the great warrior Hector (Eric Bana) is contemptuous of Paris' reckless action, but committed to his family and country all the same. He prepares the army to fight, but fears the worst.<br /><br />Every writer who has told the story of the Trojan War since ancient times has had to invent rationale to explain why all of the Greek city-states would go to war for one cuckolded king, why the Trojans don't just send Helen back to Greece, and why the great warrior Achilles withdraws from the conflict and then changes his mind. "Troy" changes some of the interactions between the characters and creates its own line of reasoning that makes sense -or as much sense as is necessary- within its own narrative. The character of Briseis (Rose Byrne), a Trojan priestess of the Temple of Apollo who is abducted by the Greeks, is a composite of "The Iliad"'s Briseis and Chryseis, Achilles' mistress and Agamemnon's captive, respectively. Combining the two women turns out to be a good idea, as she can exacerbate the conflict between Achilles and Agamemnon, provide both men with opportunity to demonstrate their character, and make mercenary, vain Achilles sympathetic. Patroclus (Garrett Hedlund) is another altered character. Traditionally Achilles' close companion, in "Troy" Patroclus is his young cousin whose eagerness proves fateful.<br /><br />Some viewers will be appalled to see an epic poem turned into epic fluff. "Troy" is 2 1/2 hours of epic fluff, occasionally bordering on cheese. Its shortcoming isn't its departure from "The Iliad" or any other source of the ancient legend. The Trojan War is legend, not a true story or even a novel to which one is expected to be faithful. The story of Troy has changed to suit its audience with every retelling for thousands of years. "Troy" carries on that tradition. The trouble is that, in condensing thousands of written pages into pivotal events and characters only, much of the substance is lost. But "Troy" does still manage to be a tragedy, as Homer intended. And it is entertaining, as I'm sure all ancient poets and oral storytellers hoped. It's just not eloquent or sophisticated. "Troy" is an abridged story, but basically an entertaining one.</p></br><a href="../users/A356TJCTCLDN89.html">A356TJCTCLDN89</a><br/><p>Troy is actually a pretty simple movie and I'll keep my comments along those lines.

The direction of Wolfgang Petersen ("Air Force One") was top-notch and flawless! The performance of superstar Brad Pitt ("Snatch", "Ocean's Eleven"), headlining the film's cast as the Greek warrior Achilles, was powerful and commanding! Once again, this is Pitt's best performance in years! The performance of Eric Bana ("The Hulk", "Black Hawk Down"), as Achilles' Trojan counterpart, Prince Hector, was not only a tour de force performance, but an unforgettable one at that! Rounding out the cast are Orlando Bloom ("The Lord of the Rings" trilogy), Diane Kruger ("Wicker Park", "National Treasure"), Brian Cox ("The Ring"), Brendan Gleeson ("Cold Mountain"), Sean Bean ("Don't Say A Word"), Saffron Burrows ("Wing Commander"), Rose Byrne ("Star Wars: Episode II -- Attack of the Clones"), Julie Christie ("Afterglow"), and Peter O'Toole ("Lawrence of Arabia") in which they gave excellent performances as well!<p>For those not familiar with Homer's "The Iliad", the oldest and most enduring story ever told, "Troy" goes like this: Trojan princes Hector (Bana) and Paris (Bloom) are on a peace-keeping errand for their father, King Priam (O'Toole), in Sparta. Paris falls for King Menelaus' (Gleeson) lovely young bride Helen (Kruger), and Paris whisks Helen back to Troy for his own. Big mistake for Paris! Because with Helen missing, not to mention Menelaus presenting the problem to his brother, the land-grabbing Super-monarch Agamemnon (Cox), who uses the problem as an excuse to start a war between Troy and most of Greece, and only a great, big wooden horse and the might of warrior-for-hire Achilles (Pitt) can infiltrate the impenetrable walls of Troy and avenge the "theft" of Helen.<p>To take on the role of Achilles, Brad Pitt worked out ferociously for months, with four hours a day of intensive body-building and four hours of fight training. But Pitt's training took a turn for the worse as an injury sidelined him for three months while filming a crucial fight scene: the mano-a-mano showdown between Achilles and Hector (In other words, Pitt had damaged his Achilles heel, paying homage to his character). Yet physically, Pitt is everything that Achilles should be: beautiful, god-like, and a fighting machine. Yet, Achilles is not a brooding, James Dean, introspective Hamlet-type, which is how he is played by Pitt. Achilles is a hero with a tragic flaw (almost always hubris). "The Iliad", like the writings of the ancient Greeks, is not about language or character development. It's about larger-than-life themes: gods, goddesses, vengeance and might, and fury and fate. With fate behind all decisions, there is almost no need for character because there is no inner struggle. The Greek myths are painted in the broadest of strokes to create the largest of pictures. The story of this is saddled with a mortality and humanity that saps it of what makes it great in the first place: infinity.<p>Nonetheless, "Troy" proved a whole lot. Pitt, a superstar and a member of Hollywood's $20-million club, has only carried a blockbuster once: "Se7en", and that was nine years ago. Likewise, the success of "Troy", to me, had a lot to say about the leading-man future of Eric Bana, whose supporting performance was the best thing about Ridley Scott's "Black Hawk Down" in 2001, but who languished as last year's "Hulk" in the Ang Lee film. Pitt did an excellent job in the film because he's buff and fights well, and we all know he can act from "Se7en" and "Twelve Monkeys", and he should have hits well into the near future. It will be long, however, before a romantic comedy or courtroom drama will test Orlando Bloom's mettle. But so long as he's shooting arrows ("The Lord of the Rings" films) and buckling swashes ("Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl") in the company of $200 million-grossing Hobbits and pirates, he's safe. It's Bana who is the revelation as Hector. His warrior physique and huge, vulnerable eyes mix perfectly for a romantic hero. Fortunately, "Troy" follows the model of all great and not-so-great Hollywood epics by having a multi-national cast with British accents for characters who wouldn't have spoken English, anchored by the last surviving British theatrical aristocracy. That's why we get screen legend Peter O'Toole as King Priam, who, dusted off, is still the best actor in any scene he's in.<p>In conclusion, "Troy" has it all: a great cast, spectacular action, a powerful storyline, and extraordinary, larger-than-life characters! My advice about the film is: Come for the Brad Pitt, savor the Orlando Bloom, and stay for the Eric Bana. And never, NEVER, under any circumstances, underestimate Peter O'Toole. "Troy", without a doubt, is a DVD must-have when it's released!</p></br><a href="../users/A29R3O02O0PON4.html">A29R3O02O0PON4</a><br/><p>This news is about a month old as of this writing, but DavisDVD reported on April 3rd that director Wolfgang Peterson is getting $1M and his chance to go back and put out his definitive version of this historical epic film, much like Ridley Scott did with Kingdom of Heaven and Oliver Stone with Alexander.<br /><br />Apparently, this new cut will be about a half-hour longer and be much more violent along with more sex.  (Rubs hands together...)<br /><br />It'll probably be released on home video in Sept. 2007.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QNQQKJTL76H0.html">A3QNQQKJTL76H0</a><br/><p>This review is about the discs themselves and not the movie. So what exactly are on these 2 DVDs? The answer: not a whole lot. In fact, this edition is shockingly devoid of content.. a real disappointment considering how great some other 2-disc sets are.<br /><br />The first disc is only the movie. No audio commentary, nothing, so why even put a "Special Features" item on the menu screen? Selecting it tells you to see Disc 2. I realize this is a long movie (over 2 hours), so space was an issue here, but the studio could've squeezed in an audio commentary track. It doesn't take that much space. Director/actor commentaries are par for the course these days and a lot of people enjoy listening to them and consider them essential to a DVD purchase. Instead, we have a French dubbed track.. and we all know how people love dubs, and French, no less.<br /><br />The second disc is appallingly miserly in content: three 10-15 minute production featurettes, a 3-D gallery of the gods (who cares about bad 3D?) which are about 5 minutes each god, and subtitles. That's it! End of story. All in all, that's less than 1 hour of content. The featurettes are mildly interesting, but are too short and left me wanting more. That's the reason I and a whole lot of people buy these DVD 2 disc sets: to see the behind the scenes stuff and details about the film making process.<br /><br />Other historically based movie DVD's like Kingdom of Heaven and Last Samurai pack a lot of content in and you get a lot for your money. Not here. The second disc is virtually useless. Yet another lazy DVD put out by a studio seeking to cut corners. Don't reward lazy studios. Heaven is a much better movie and has a lot of overlap with this one (some of the same actors: Bloom, Gleeson), huge epic battle scenes.. plus it's a Ridley Scott film, and the DVD is packed with features.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JHHYYOOO4DS6.html">A2JHHYYOOO4DS6</a><br/><p>Interesting story of the problems love can cause when left in the hands of the young and foolish/inexperienced. Brad Pitt did justice to the role as hero and so did the other major leads.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>I don't understand the lukewarm critical and to some degree public reception to "Troy".  I attribute it to some degree with the liberties I am told were taken by the filmmakers with Homer's "The Iliad".  I wouldn't know since I slept through this portion of world cultures class when I was in school.  My teachers just couldn't make it as engaging as Wolfgang Petersen has here.  Alot of the invective was also directed at Brad Pitt's performance as Achilles.  This role is a no-win situation for Pitt.  How do you portray the greatest warrior the world has known without appearing to be a bit preening and narcissistic?  Director Petersen has staged here an impressive spectacle indeed.  The sprawl of this film takes your breath away.  The battle scenes are as impressive as anything this side of "Braveheart".  The spectacle would be nothing, however, if the characters were overwhelmed by the proceedings.  Fortunately, this film contains a number of wonderful performances.  Special citation has to go to Eric Bana who gives a star-making performance as Hector.  Bana more than holds his own, sometimes dominating, the more seasoned pros he is working with.  Peter O'Toole as Priam can still command the screen forty years after "Lawrence of Arabia" with that unmistakable voice and those intense eyes.  Newcomer Rose Byrne as Briseis, niece of Priam, is an engaging actress.  I found myself more attracted to her character than I was to Diane Kruger as Helen, the beauty that launched a thousand ships.  If you're looking for entertainment that will also offer food-for-thought then "Troy" is the film for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ADG449ZNEO6Y.html">A1ADG449ZNEO6Y</a><br/><p>Most likely the largest ammount of soliders in a war I ever seen in a movie.It wasn't to bloody but a nice clean movie.Yes they show blood and spears through heads and whatever not , but I woyuldn't own it just for the simple fact it's 162 minutes long and I won't ever watch it again.Brad Pitt played his part very well as the best warrior of the world.He was badd-azz.Rent this movie only.</p></br><a href="../users/A77184QJM3PM.html">A77184QJM3PM</a><br/><p>The main thing this film has in its favor is the beautiful country it was shot in. The landscapes and backdrops are jaw-droppingly beautiful. That said, lets focus on the movie itself. Wolfgang Peterson took many, many departures from the legend of Troy in this film, and gave a timeless story from the ages a well-worn soap-opera feel. The action sequences were obviously well-planned and are truthfully quite spectacular. If only everyone hadn't seen the Lord of the Rings films, with their very superior army clash sequences. It was as if the fights had been seen before, although the Achilles fights were notable highlights. I bring special notice to Peter O'Toole here, for he brought a special dignity and grace to King Priam, and Eric Bana does a fine job as Hector. Brad Pitt was noticeably very buff in the role of Achilles, although he seemed a bit too much on the pouty side for a great warrior of the ages. Diane Kruger as Helen may have been a bit in over her head here. She honestly didn't have much to do here, except appear here and there in the story. Overall, the film drags a bit, the actors seem bored with the whole thing at times, but it just does work. The DVD transfer was very good, with rich contrast and great sound quality.</p></br><a href="../users/A13RM1AWD1C5ZR.html">A13RM1AWD1C5ZR</a><br/><p>Ok listen, I know what you're thinking, you think I'm probably crazy to give this movie a good review, but personally I enjoyed it.  Infact I saw it twice, once with my dad and the second time with my mother since my mom wasn't able to see it with us the first time.  I must say this film has plenty of problems, during the credits of Troy, it says that this film is inspired by Homer's The Illiad, which is very inaccurate.  Sure this film is enjoyable and entertaining but in order for it to be entertaining you have to ignore the fact that The Illiad even exists.<br />  But the $200 million budget of the film shows.  The cinematography is great, the sets are pretty extraodinary and the acting is decent.  Achilles is not a role made for Brad Pitt but I should point out that Pitt is a fine actor, this just isn't a role made for him.  While Brad Pitt does look the part he certainly isn't it, though I do commend him for his hard work in preparing for the physical aspects of the role, he just lacks grandiosity.  But you pretty much have to enjoy this as a Brad Pitt movie. Better movies with him include Fight Club and Se7en.  Eric Bana as Hector was very impressive infact his performance along with Peter O'Toole's performance as King Priam were the only really worthy ones.  Orlando BLoom as Paris and Diane Krueger as Helen, well enough said, I mean sure they look good but they just aren't convincing enough.  Brian Cox and Brendan Gleeson were fine though I should point out.<br />  This film wasn't horrific as some people view it to be.  I must say I did expect more considering that Wolfgang Petersen directed this film, he's made some great films such as Das Boot, Air Force One and In the Line of Fire, and The Perfect Storm was decent.  James Horner's score wasn't abhorrent as some people claim it to be, infact I didn't know that Gabriel Yared the original composer was fired.  The battle sequences were good, but they could've done more with them due to the fact that the battle sequences resulted in a one on one combat scene.<br />The fight between Hector and Achilles was excellent though, the best one in the movie.  I'm not too sure to say if the battle sequences in this film were better than well let's say Return of the King's but they were definitely on par.  Gladiator is certainly a better epic, considering that Troy is pretty much a Gladiator wanna be.  Troy is historically confusing, overlong and lacking in parts, such as Petersen's decision to omit the Gods from the film.  This is a 2 hour and 40 minute film so I should warn you.  It's also not that bloody, Gladiator is a lot bloodier.  While Troy is entertaining it does have its problems,<br />but call me insane but I might consider purchasing this film on DVD, but that's not for sure yet.<br />  Troy is rated R for Graphic Violence and Some Sexuality/Nudity.  The battles in Troy are aggressive and fierce<br />but aren't very graphic, there's some occasional blood.  The battles include the use of spears, arrows, swords, etc.  The sexual content isn't really explicit which was a let down, just kidding.  There was some steamy kissing, and partial nudity.  All in all, an enjoyable epic which is worth seeing in theatres but incase you chose not to see it definetly rent it when it hits the shelves at Blockbuster.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>I know I learned all about Greek history and mythology in high school, but that was too many years ago so I didn't know what in this movie was true to history and what was altered. Maybe my ignorance helped me enjoy the movie more than some. I thought the battle sequences were well done and the costuming excellent. Some of the characters didn't have much to do, while others we were given a good amount of depth to understand their motivations. Peter O'Toole owned the screen in his scene with Achilles asking for his son's body to be returned. Brad Pitt did a nice job with Achilles. The only complaint I have is the nihilistic way the character was written became a little irritating to deal with as the movie went on. Brian Cox is his usual nasty self as Agamemnon and it would have been nice to see Brendon Gleason have a bigger role as Menelaus.<br /><br />My biggest trouble with Troy is the almost 3 hour length. It didn't need to be that long. A few scenes cut out or shortened would have made a tighter movie. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Troy and would recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>I have to wonder who approves these projects in Hollywood.  I guess the execs felt safe retelling an old story using big-name stars.  But the end product was just another empty action adventure with cardboard cut-out characters.  While Russell Crowe was inspiring in Gladiator, Brad Pitt falls flat as Achilles.  Frankly he is not a very good actor and has done nothing noteworthy since Fight Club.  I was not bored by this movie, but I was also not moved by it either.  Its worth renting, but noting more.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>Bold and ambitious, "Troy" adds little to the historical epic genre. It has all the right moves in the epic area - great battles, great sets, etc. On the human scale, it succeeds barely at all. Still, it has an overall grandeur and sweep that is both entertaining and interesting. It succeeds in spite of its flaws.<br /><br />In the great epics - from "The Ten Commandments" to "Spartacus" to "Gladiator" - there is a balance between great battles for great causes and the love between a man and a woman.<br /><br />"Troy" doesn't succeed on the human level. The legend is that the Greek Paris [Orlando Bloom] took Helen of Troy [Diane Kruger] away from her husband, the King [Brian Cox], which caused the Trojan War. But nothing in the relationship between Paris and Troy suggests a great passion that would cause a great war. The subplot about the great warrior Achilles' [Brad Pitt] love of a Trojan priestess is much more involving, but it hardly explains reasons for the war.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4.html">A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4</a><br/><p>This movie is not at all what I was expecting! I was pleasantly shocked at how topical a 3000+ year old story really could be. For a bloody, violent film the ultimate message is antt-war/pro-peace. Achilles (Pitt) is a non-religious man who sees the ridiculousness in fighting for greed & glory (Agamemnon) or religious folly (Priam). Seems as though our own world leaders could take a lesson.  Eric Bana (Hector) essentially steals the show while Orlando Bloom (Paris) rounds out the cast and makes a fine showing. Again there is more to this film than mindless action and violence. It has a great message, if you have the capacity to understand it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HX00DL0SZM1G.html">A1HX00DL0SZM1G</a><br/><p>It seems like every couple of months there's a new film hyped as an epic--but they rarely live up to the billing. Such is the case with "Troy," which is based on Homer's story "The Illiad."<br />Most incarnations of this story have been devoted to the love affair between Trojan Prince Paris (Orlando Bloom, "Pirates of the Caribbean") and Spartan Queen Helen (Diana Kruger, "Michael Valiant"), which sparked the decade-long war between the Trojans and Greeks. But screenwriter David Benioff ("The 25th Hour") focuses this saga on the warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt, "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind").<br />Casting Pitt in the role of Achilles seemed odd for a number of reasons, not the least of which is Pitt's boy-next-door looks. He could have just as easily been cast as Trojan general Hector--played magnificently by Eric Bana ("Hulk")--as in the role of the brooding, glory-hunting Achilles.<br />Maybe Warner Bros. figured the best way to attract women to a film that has enough bloodshed to make Quentin Tarantino jealous would be to cast Pitt parading around barely clothed. (I've seen so much of Brad Pitt now that I felt like I should apologize to his (then) wife, Jennifer Aniston.)<br />But Pitt is an incredible actor and he easily pulls off making Achilles a multidimensional character.<br />Some noticeable changes were made to Homer's version of the story, such as who killed whom and at what point in the story, but the dramatic intensity of the film greatly benefits from these changes.<br />The opening battle scene with the Greeks storming the Trojan beach seemed like a swords and spears version of Stephen Spielberg's opening to "Saving Private Ryan," while other battle scenes recalled Mel Gibson's "Braveheart."<br />Unlike those war-theme epics, however, director Wolfgang Petersen ("The Perfect Storm") had the luxury of a main event battle that would make boxing promoter Don King envious, with Achilles squaring off against Hector.<br />Other principal characters of "The Illiad" are peripheral faces in Petersen's "Troy" as he builds to this clash of titans. As Achilles mows down wave after wave of Trojan soldiers, Hector defeats scores of Greek soldiers and generals before his inevitable conflict with Achilles.<br />"Troy" boasts an excellent supporting cast, with Brian Cox ("The Bourne Identity") as head Greek general Agamemnon, Sean Bean ("The Lord of the Rings") as Achilles' closest friend Odysseus, the legendary Peter O'Toole ("Imperium: Augustus") as Troy's King Priam and Bloom, who continues making wise career moves.<br />What keeps "Troy" from becoming an epic is that sense of awe and amazement of watching a film like "Saving Private Ryan" in witnessing the atrocities of war, or "Braveheart," which features memorable speeches that make your spine tingle. There is no lavish, lush scenery as the battlegrounds are fought on desolate, arid plains.<br />No, "Troy" is all about the action, and in that sense it has more in common with Russell Crowe's "Gladiator," another total adrenaline-rush film that doesn't bother with looking pretty or sounding preachy.<br />The action scenes are tremendous and the setup and battle between Achilles and Hector is moviemaking at its best. Petersen delivers on the hype for the film's main event and wisely speeds through the rest of the story (The Trojan Horse, Achilles' fate, etc.).<br />Petersen doesn't waste scenes, and with a story this immense in scope, the length is reasonable and the pace moves briskly so that it barely feels like a three-hour film.<br />Teachers who are looking for a way to get their students into Greek mythology have a new tool for making learning exciting--despite the liberties taken with the story. And action fans have a new film to add to their must-see movie list.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>I must admit that initially I didn't want to watch this movie. I'm not a big Brad Pitt fan and I viewed this as just another vehicle for Brad to strike a glamorous pose or two and nothing more. Fortunately I changed my mind and gave it and chance and I'm happy I did.<br /><br />'Troy' released in '04 is an epic of grand proportions, brilliantly directed with a crisp script, stellar cast and memorable soundtrack. Brad Pitt was perfect for the part of Achilles as was Eric Bana as Hector. I would also like to credit Peter O'Toole for delivering one of his best performances in years as Priam, King of Troy, Diane Kruger as the lovely Helen and Sean Bean in the role of King Odysseus.</p></br><a href="../users/AK1OBVI54SY73.html">AK1OBVI54SY73</a><br/><p>I have to be honest. This movie was great, full of action and just enough drama to keep it the tragic story it is supposed to be. One of the better historical films I have witnessed...but there is a problem. This story was supposed to be more centered on the two lovers, Paris and Helen, and it wasn't. No they centered more on Achilles, Brad Pitt. Brad Pitt is the bigger actor, so they of course wanted him to stay in the spotlight, and Brad Pitt did very well as Achilles. But I felt they should have made the situation between Paris and Helen more in the center of everything, since they are the ones who started this whole story. You see a lot more of Achilles and Hector though than Paris and Helen, and although like I said it makes it a very fascinating film, I still have to shave off a star because one of the things I wanted to see more of was this Paris and Helen situation more strongly than it was. Matter of fact they strengthened more on the relationship of Achilles and his eventual lover in the film than Paris and Helen.<br />Yet I cannot hate this film. It was as I said exciting and the characters that played this film supported the movie. It is definitely one of the better films I have seen historically and I love how they played out the movie. I just wish they would have stayed focused a little better on Paris and Helen. Yet Brad Pitt made it a film to enjoy with him as the centerfold.<br /><br />I recommend this film over Gladiator, King Arthur, and Alexander. Troy is a lot more exciting of a film than any of these others. That's my opinion at least.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>Troy is an amazing adaption of Homer's "The Illiad."

Brad Pitt plays Achilles and Eric Bana his arch foe Hector.  Instead of projecting larger-than-life heroes out at us, they're instead mopey, brooding, and pensive.  This approach may be appropriate for the slacker generation they represent, but it doesn't do much to stir the viewer's adrenline.  Someone forgot to swash the buckle on this one.<br /><br />  Just alright and quickly forgotten.  Glad it was a rental and not a purchase.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>Well, despite the fact that they mispronounce the name "Menelaus" throughout the entire film ( ...It's "Men-uh-LAY-uss," not "Men-uh-LOWSE," you sunbaked Hollywood airheads!!  Just crack open a dictionary sometime, fercrissake...) and despite an inaccuracy or two here and there... (Didn't Ajax die after Achilles?  Like, didn't he scoop his armor up off the beach, and all that...? ) and despite the fact that hardly anyone on this film looks even remotely Greek... and despite the film giving the impression that a torturous ten-year war took place in the span of a few weeks...  Despite all that, this film was still fun, about as good a sword-and-sandal epic as we're likely to get in this day and age.  Brad Pitt, though buff as can be, perhaps isn't the greatest choice as Achilles, but Eric Bana is surprisingly moving as Hector, the champion of Troy, investing him with a tremendous pathos... The script is fairly tight, the sets look grand, the computer generated armies aren't too mechanical, the violence has heft.  In short, it works as an action film.<br /><br />That being said, the screenwriters and producers should be ashamed or at least abashed at how they distorted the Greek legends and bent history to fit their narrative scope.  The prime example of this is the melodramatic slaying of King Agamemnon at the film's climax:  Agamemnon actually returned from the Trojan War and was later slain in a palace intrigue.  His murder was the source of an entirely separate drama, and monkeying with the details of his death is a particularly egregious untruth.<br /><br />I weary of Hollywood writers who defend their despoiling of history by saying, "oh look, it's just a movie and I can write it any way I want to..." It's one thing to elide past peripheral events or omit facts that bog a story down, another thing altogether to willfully change the facts entirely.  Not only is it simply evil and wrong to rewrite history, it's just plain lazy.  They may claim that they are professionals who know how best to tell a story, but c'mon: if you can't figure out how to come up with a proper dramatic ending using the real story of "The Iliad," then you just aren't as skilled a craftsman as you'd like us to believe.  You're just a hack with a tight deadline. And in the case of the Iliad in particular, it's not "just a movie." This is probably the only version of this story -- one of the world's most important historical narratives -- that most people in our demi-literate pop culture will ever learn: couldn't you at least make the effort to get the details straight?  Is it really that hard?  Do you really gain that much dramatically by screwing up our perception of history?  Fie, a pox apon you lazy Hollywood twits.  If you can't be bothered to present history accurately, then don't choose an historical story to tell.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NQI2JLNPFOF8.html">A3NQI2JLNPFOF8</a><br/><p>Ok, not an accurate portrayal of the Illiad, of course....but still fun to watch.  And I liked the nihilism, too.  Really, though, this is probably the best Trojan War adaptation I've seen.  Alot of people are saying that Helen of Troy is much better.  Well, I'd have to disagree...Helen of Troy looks exactly like what it was meant to be: a TV drama.<br /><br />Anyway....Eric Bana is unbelievable in this.  Far better performance than Pitt's.  Unfortunately, I think that his presence in this movie was undermined due to the 'apparent' disappointment of the 'Hulk'.  But with Pitt....well....I like the guy....but I'm going to have to call "bad casting" on this one.  Here's why.  When I see Bad Pitt running around swinging a sword in a dress.....I don't see Achilles....I see Brad Pitt with a sword.  And whereas a Greek warrior would look kinda cool swinging a sword around, Brad Pitt just looks silly.  This is what happens when a celebrity gets shoved in our face too much....he becomes unbelievable in movie roles.  People like Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise will never fully 'transform' into their roles because we'll always see them as the celebrity.<br /><br />By the way...Brian Cox looks just like the real Agememnon.  Don't believe me?  Try searching for an ancient Greek artifact engraved with Agememnon's face (it might have been a death mask).  It looks just like Brian Cox.  I can't help but think that when the casting directors were searching for possible actors, they took one look at a picture of this gold plate and said, "What the....this looks just like Brian Cox!"</p></br><a href="../users/A21XVS00AIENLX.html">A21XVS00AIENLX</a><br/><p>Here are the best things about this movie:<br /><br />1) Brad Pitt all Buffed up<br /><br />2) Eric Bana all Buffed up<br /><br />3) Brad Pitt in a Tunic<br /><br />4) Eric Bana in a tunic<br /><br />5) Brad Pitt getting Naked<br /><br />Everything else is just a special effect.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Troy" is a masterpiece!

The supporting cast is wonderful; in particular Eric Bana as Paris' brother, Hector, and Peter O'Toole as his father, King Prium.  Their scenes are the best in the film.<br /><br />On the down side, Brad Pitt, while ruggedly handsome and sincere, never really loses himself in the character of an ancient Greek hero; you can't forget he's Brad Pitt.  The actress who plays Helen is not the classic beauty one would expect and looks like so many modern starlets.  The battle scenes are for the most part filmed in close-ups and edited in very quick shots, which makes them look blurry and chaotic, and you may need a scorecard to keep up with all the characters.<br /><br />Troy has the look and feel of a good epic, but isn't a great one.  If you enjoy sword and sandal war movies with handsome leading men, you'll like Troy.  Brad Pitt is delicious eye-candy and that just may be good enough after all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>I'm a fan of Greek Mythology and 'Troy' gives 100% and comes out gold. From the actors to the beautiful scenery, "Troy" is a film of brilliance.<br /><br />Brad Pitt fits the role of Achilles perfectly. Everyone does a great job in their characters. The story is really one of tragedy and misunderstandings. You notice in this film that a lot of the destruction and death was caused by wrong decisions. I really do love this movie, and if you love the story of the Trojan War and you love Greek Mythology. This is for you!</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>Whoops, wrong war. John Wayne actually says something like that to William Holden in "The Horse Soldiers." That movie told the tale of a Union raid on the Railway station at . . . somewhere, it might not of been Atlanta. It was a story about the stress between the Doctor, Holden (why are all Doctors so pacifist . . .don't we have any facist Doctors anymore?) and the Hawk Wayne. It's also the answer to the trivia question "In what John Wayne movie set in the 1860's does a jet airplane fly over the blue skies." It also says very little about the Civil War, neither makes any attempt to be accurate and kind of freelances from scene to scene.<p>The point is that no movie made by Hollywood and an army of CPA's is going to risk taking on The Illiad or any other ancient text. It's not supposed to. The Illiad, along with Hamlet, Exodus, Chaucer and probably a 1000 other great stories weren't written for anything but paper. Or in Homer's time, papyrus. Or scrolls. Or whatever.<p>Maya Angelou writes of Oprah Winfrey's Book Club that she (Angelou) didn't like some of the books Winfrey chose 'but at least she got people reading something.'<p>So kudos to the cast of Troy. Interesting story. Did it follow the book written 2000 years ago? Golly. No. But if it sparks some interest . . . if it gets people out of thinking the world begins and ends with the Emmys, X games and MTV, that guy deserves a medal.<p>Brad Pitt is worth seeing just for the benefit of appreciating what a year in a gym can do for you. Eric Bana too. They were all good. It's an interesting tale. If you want to find out the "why," heck, then you go to the library.<p>My only complaint was that I would have liked Brad Pitt's Mom to tell us why he was ONLY VULNERABLE TO A WOUND ON HIS HEEL. That would have been helpful.<p>4 stars. Nice try. Not a bad way to spend a rainy afternoon.

He could have filmed the graphic violence depicted in The Iliad to greater effect. But I'm sick and tired of all these damn purists hollering "historical" epic. The Iliad was a greek myth, not an actual historical event, but a long poem composed by a writer named Homer. However, I do maintain that if you are going to base the movie on the book, the writer, producer, and director of the film should have kept to the original story. Why call it "Troy" and then fabricate something else if just to sucker in those who've read the Iliad. It's the same thing with comic book adaptations like the X Men. Why adapt material of such a large devoted following and change the character histories, costumes, etc., and call it the X Men?<br /><br />Troy, of itself, is a good Hollywood film. Pawned as Homer's Iliad, the movie's not just a fraud, it's a disgrace and an insult. As if the producers of the film felt that they could improve on a story that's been around, studied, and loved for over 2,500 years. I think Verhoeven, Peter Jackson, or Spielberg--especially with the brutality of Saving Private Ryan (wow)--could have done not only a better job, but they--I believe--would have stayed truer to Homer's original story. As far as violence goes, no novel revels in it like the Iliad. A film version of the book, if depicted as Homer depicted in the Iliad, would be a strong NC-17 or a weak X rating. If you want to see--or visualize--action and violence on a whole other level, read the Iliad and skip Troy. But if you're just looking for a good popcorn, beer, smoke, movie then Troy is as advertised.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>Helen leaves her husband for a young man!<br />Agamemnon attacks Troy with a wooden horse!<br />Brad Pitt/Achilles looks buff and acts moody - and gets his heel cut!<br />"Troy" completely ignores Homer's Iliad!<br /><br />Oy. What a mess of an adaptation. If you even have a passing fancy for Greek Historical Fiction, then "Troy" will annoy you senseless. Like when Achilles and his cousin are sparring among the ruins? I mean, if it was the present, wouldn't they NOT be in ruins? And what of the fate of Agamemnon (well played by the always dependable Brian Cox)? Did his wife just move up the date for his death and nobody told us?<br /><br />The three-star rating is for the fact that, as epics go, "Troy" is really stunning to watch. Big Battles! Buff Bodies! Beautiful Ladies! Intrigue! Horses and Ships at Sea! Peter freaking O'Toole! Just forget anything you ever learned about Greek History or the writings of Homer and you'll get a good PopCorn adventure. But if you can't?

But why do people get upset if the movie doesn't<br /><br />play out like the book? If it was going to be just like<br /><br />the book there would be little point in even making it<br /><br />a movie.<br /><br />I thought the movies was abit of the mixed bag... I<br /><br />thought Brad Pitt was average at best... I really<br /><br />think they could have got someone else for the role<br /><br />and came better off. He came off pretty well in the<br /><br />fight scenes, but otherwise he was unconvincing to<br /><br />me as a tough cold hearted sword fighter.<br /><br />Another problem was Blooms character... He was simply<br /><br />way to weak and looked to young. I would have a hard<br /><br />time understanding how a woman would love can compassion<br /><br />for such a weakling.<br /><br />Otherwise I think the film had good acting... The guy<br /><br />that played as Hector really took the show in this one.<br /><br />He was convincing as a good fighter, but at the same<br /><br />time down to earth and beatable. The movie showing<br /><br />Achillies to be so unbeatable kind of hurt Hector<br /><br />and it's ashame... I believe it took alittle sting<br /><br />out of the Achillies/Hector show down.<br /><br />Also, I think the movie should have put more effort<br /><br />into the fall of Troy instead of so much attention<br /><br />on Achilles. The fall of Troy was simply way to<br /><br />secondary when it should have got a better role in<br /><br />the film.<br /><br />This film was very much worth renting... But it falls<br /><br />short of a great movie like Gladiator.</p></br><a href="../users/APZ9MBMUKD2W.html">APZ9MBMUKD2W</a><br/><p>This film is not perfect but then what film is? But as a Teacher its a great way to introduce my students to that Windy Hill in Asia Minor. One gets the feel of those distant times and the problems that they faced. Most of my students take the side of Hector over the rest of the Mob. I shall not repeat what they think of Paris or Helen. (To put it nicely they would of been thrown over the side before reaching Troy)</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>If you like old-fashioned epics with casts of thousands and a storyline full of heroes, this 2004 film is for you.  It's almost three hours long but the time does fly.  There are battles and swordsmanship and characters spouting lines that are so overdone that I burst out laughing.  But who really cares about historical context in a film like this?  And if the nuances seem a little modern for this 3000-year-old myth by Homer, it doesn't really matter. When he wrote it, little did he know that it had all the makings of a Hollywood spectacle, including a romance at its core. This is when one of the princes of Troy, after a couple of nights of stolen passion, whisked away the beautiful Helen who was married to the King of Sparta.  Later, Troy would eventually be destroyed because of this and everyone watching the film probably knew that but yet, it's great fun to see how it all plays out.<br /><br />Brad Pitt is cast as Achilles, a warrior for the Spartans who is having second thoughts about the wisdom of serving his king. It's obvious he's been to the gym because of his defined muscles and a body shape crafted by a personal trainer and vitamin supplements. He's also been trained in swordplay and there is one scene in which he is teaching his younger male cousin to fence which might be viewed as homo-erotic.  However, there are other scenes in which he defines himself as a man who loves women, especially in the scene in which he seduces the young female cousin of the King of Troy.<br /><br />The performance of the woman cast as Helen and her Prince lover plays like amateur hour.  However, Eric Bana, an actor I have never seen before, is cast as Hector, the prince's older brother.  His performance is masterful and his presence dominated every scene he was in.  But as far as I'm concerned, the very best performance of all was by Peter O'Toole, cast as the King of Troy.  There is one scene in particular, in which he begs Achilles, who has just murdered the king's son Hector, for the right to give his Hector a dignified burial.  Shakespearian in nature, this is a scene I will long remember.<br /><br />This film can be enjoyed only if you don't think about historical reality and just relax and watch the forces of lust and revenge and warfare and pomp and glitter let you forget that this film is downright silly.  Of course Troy falls far short of my highest recommendation, but frankly, I recommend you see it anyway.  It's a pleasant diversion and an evening's entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>As the credits note at the end, this film is based on the Epic Story . What is probably most noteworthy about the film is that it is retold in a "modern" way, and is done to suit the milieu of here and now. That is what this kind of story is all about; it's not the exact story that counts, it is the essence of the story that counts. It helps if you include the translations of the classic lines, but people who are pedants for the textual original have to know that the feeling and the point of this story is one from a thoroughly oral tradition, so it is quite appropos that a version of this kind should appear.<br /><br />Yes, it has lessons; yes it has points to make, but the greatness of films like this one, is that it is immensely  entertaining.<br /><br />I was especially  impressed with Eric Bana... from Stand up comic, to playing Chopper Reid on film, Bana has been surprising in his ability to play diverse  roles.<br /><br />Plus, the diverse characters who support the central leads are amazing. Peter O'toole is superb in this role.<br /><br />In addition, the loss of the gods as a story telling  device says a lot about  the current society rather than the society of the time of TROY.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>This was an entertaining film that almost discounts Homer's Iliad entirely. I watched the film as a seperate version of a similar story and I enjoyed it. Brad Pitt is a good enough actor and is physically a good choice for Achilles, but his acting isn't enough when compared to the great work from Eric Bana as Hector or Peter O'tToole as King Priam. Orlando Bloom as Paris and the girl who played Helen were a joke and the lame dialogue they were given didn't help in the least. I wouldn't put this film in the same breath as Braveheart, Gladiator, or even The Last of the Mohicans in terms of great epic films, but after seeing the travesty that was Alexander I now appreciate this film as just pure entertainment. I gave it 5 stars instead of 4 to balance out some of the harsh reviews listed below.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2URG8OHNEDS.html">A1R2URG8OHNEDS</a><br/><p>The story of the Trojan War is one of my favorites. I havn't read the actually poam of The Iliad, but I read an easier version, and thought that the story was great. When I heard that it was going to become a movie, "Troy", I was very excited. When I heard that it was going to star Brad Pitt, that irked me a little bit. I learned that it was going to be 165 minutes, close to three hours. I began to think it was going to be a new great epic. This movie had everything going for it, and I thought it was going to become a five star wonder, but it actually fell short by one star. The one star was lost, mostly because of Brad Pitt. The movie got greta star power because of Eric Bana, who I noticed from "Hulk" which came out last summer. <p>The movie begins in the 12th century BC. The army of King Agamemnon wants to expand his land and take over Greece. Agamemnon calls for Achilles, who is supposed to be the greatest warrior alive who has no weaknesses, to fight Thessaly, a part of Greece they want. They take over, but Agamemnon needs to call him again and bring him to Troy. Prince Paris has fallen in love and taken Agamemnon's brother Menelaus's wife Helen, and has brought her back to his homeland of Troy. Paris' brother Hector doesn't want any problems, and tries to make his father Priam, the king, to send her back to home on a ship. Agamemnon decides to help his brother, after finding out that he if takes Troy he will have taken over Greece. The Greeks assemble 1000 ships, and head out to Troy to get Helen back to her home, along with Odysses, who becomes a sort of leader to the Trojans.<p>"Troy" was a well made movie, with a kind of "Lord of the Rings" fashion with the battle scenes and some of the camera angles. It also had a great score, and the three hours felt like it was only about ninety minutes. The time just flew by. The problem was Brad Pitt. He did not make a good Achilles, and he kind of killed the entire movie. He lost the movie an entire star. I have only seen one movie with Brad Pitt, and that is "Oceans 11." He also kind of killed that movie. A minor problem is that the nudity in this movie is pointless. They could have showed everything they needed to without the nudity. "Troy" focused more on the romance of these figures, and not on the war. There was a heart in Achilles, but Brad Pitt couldn't show heart in this character. I enjoyed "Troy" but a better Achilles would have made it great.<p>ENJOY!<p>Rated R for graphic violence and some sexuality/nudity.</p></br><a href="../users/AQUVTQFFXP4AC.html">AQUVTQFFXP4AC</a><br/><p>*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />When I first saw the preview, I thought "What a fantastic idea!" movies about Ancient Greece seemed rare to me (not being a fanatic, or knowing of the older movies)<br /><br />I knew once the movie was over that it was very poor... and it took me a few more viewings to realize how horrible it was.<br /><br />First off, the music is all middle-eastern sounding. I realize Troy is in western Asia-ish (like around ancient Pergamum and such) and such, but come one, this music sounded like a day in the deserts of Arabia. More suited for Kingdom of Heaven or Hidalgo.<br /><br />Historical accuracy?  You'd find a fair share more in something like Gladiator or Kingdom of Heaven (not to bash the films, simply pointing out that they aren't very accurate). Agammemnon and Menelaus are portrayed as fat greedy villains interested only in themselves, the Trojans portrayed as noblemen and upright in every way (even Paris, who in mythology, was sly as a fox), and Achilles as a moody drama queen! He's stubborn and arrogant and stuck-up and very very rude, like when he told that poor boy in Thessalonica, "That's why no one will remember your name" when the boy said he was afraid of the Thessalonican warrior sent to fight Achilles.<br /><br />The battle which was supposed to be 10 years, seemed to last less than a month, with most of that time being the 12 days they gave peace for Hector's death! In the entire movie, none of the characters change in appearance---Peter O'Toole's Priam looks on the verge of death, without any change, Agammemnon doesn't gray, no one changes in what is supposed to be 10 years, and the way the movie passes makes it seem like each passing day is just that; one passing day. Agammemnon and Menelaus survive in mythology, yet both die in this movie, probably because they were the "bad guys" in the film.<br /><br />This is a big one: Mythology. This movie seems to spit in the face of mythology, use Homer's book pages as toilet paper, and then throw up venom on the sheer "coolness" of the legend of Troy. The legend of Achilles being immortal and his only weakness being his heel is sneered at, when Paris shoots Achilles through the heel, we think "WOW! the legend! His heel is his only weak spot!" hence the term "Achilles Heel" meaning our greatest weakness...<br /><br />Then Achilles gets shot five times in the chest. So to the average viewer, who knows nothing about Achilles's legend, what do you think kills Achilles, a shot in the heel, or five shots in the chest?<br /><br />That plus the callous way in which the director--through characters like Hector and Achilles and such--seem to treat the Gods like crap, and doesn't portray their influence at all, as opposed to say "Alexander", which gives the Gods a light, dubious touch, such as showing hints of Zeus watching over him (the Eagle). The Trojans constantly claim the Gods are on their side, and the pompous way in which they say it seems to make you envision the director going "Pfft, what idiots! believing in the Gods of their time, HAH! Jesus Christ our lord and savior is the only God and THEY should've known that! So they die for their heresy! DIE DIE DIE!"<br /><br />Another big problem is something that also messed up the game Warcraft III. It is TOO HERO-BASED. In the movie, so much emphasis is placed on heroes like Achilles and Hector, that the armies pretty much play absolutely no role at all in the movie! It doesn't matter that the Greeks outnumber the Trojans 2 or 3 to 1, they absolutely can't win without Achilles!!! It doesn't matter that the Trojans are defended by epic walls and the best archers in the world, they can't win without Hector!!!<br /><br />All in all, a very poor put-together movie, with a kind of stubborn negative and childish mentality towards the ways, beliefs, and customs of the times, pretty much re-writing the legend of Troy to make it more marketable to audiences who want to gawk at Brad Pitt naked (yes, he's naked several times for no real reason) and the amount of men they can cram into one shot. The acting is wooden, and hearing Achilles whine and sass like a snotty teenage girl just irritates.  The characters are portrayed all wrong, the Gods and the Myths aren't just ignored---they're subtly cursed and treaded and stomped in the mud.<br /><br />The legend was torn open, the parts the director liked picked apart, and made more Hollywood-friendly for the money.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>Practically all we know of the Trojan War came down to us from Homer's Iliad and I had expected that this movie would bear some resemblance to the story.  There was some resemblance, but not all that much.<br /><br />When Helen was taken from Sparta, it was supposed to be when Menelaus was away at a funeral, but not in this movie.  The war lasted for 10 years, and it was compressed in the movie to weeks, or maybe a couple of months.  That is some difference from Homer's depiction of it.  Paris was supposed to be killed at Troy and Helen didn't escape.  Also, Menelaus was not killed at Troy, and neither was Agamemnon.  In Homer Menelaus got Helen back and returned home, and Agamemnon returned home also, but brought Priam's daughter Cassandra with him and was killed, at home, in his bathtub, by his wife and her lover.<br /><br />I have to wonder why a more faithful story was not made.  The original is exciting enough, with no need for the dramatic excesses invented for this movie.<br /><br />The Iliad is not all that long a book and would be more worthwhile, more entertaining, and more rewarding than watching this nonsensical movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EFS5PV3HOFDI.html">A1EFS5PV3HOFDI</a><br/><p>I am sorry to say that I watched this movie with very high expectations. And am equally sorry to say that this movie did not live up to them. The only reason it is even remotely recieving four stars, is the fight scenes between Brad Pitt and Eric Bana. Also, Brad Pitt did his his role pretty well. Now for the complaints on this movie.<br /><br />First of all the movie seemed to forced. The dialogue was harsh and abrupt. Orlando Bloom doing better as a blonde arrow slinging elf than a hot sexy stud trying to win over Helen. Talking of Helen, I thought she was supposed to be the most beautiful woman in the world!!!!!!?<br /><br />Now to talk about Orlando Bloom, er... complain. Paris, contrary to the movie where he was son to King Priam ruler of Troy, Paris was supposed to be nothing more than a humble goat herder!!! Big difference people. He went to Troy to escape the wrath of Helen's husband. Again, big difference.<br /><br />Ok, this brings us now to the dialogue. Whats up with Brad Pitt insulting the King by calling him a "cask of wine?" When was that ever an insult? Not just that, but the writing of the dialogue was definetly too American, it left me feeling more like  I was watching a cheap shot at something being Mythological.<br /><br />The only good thing  about this movie was the scene where Wolfang Peterson showed the wide camera view of the army outside of Troy. Now that was impressive. But then he went and ruined it by stealing from Peter Jackson's  shot in his last LOTR movie where Viggo Mortenson and his small army are surrounded by Suron's. Just before Frodo throws the ring into the fire. Hmmm, back to Troy.<br /><br />Brad Pitt did a wonderful job, he at least deserved an academy award, being the sexy, brooding Achilles. But again, Wolfgang ruined it by killing him off in the end. He already twisted facts around, so why not just smudge over history and let poor Achilles run off with his lover?<br /><br />Last question. What ever happened to Cassandra? The crazed priestess who warned them not to bring in the trojan horse!<br /><br />That, and where did every body keep getting the wood if they where on a beach?</p></br><a href="../users/A2RW7HXNEJ0QTQ.html">A2RW7HXNEJ0QTQ</a><br/><p>Pitt did a great job in this movie...

Pitt did a very credible job, and I though Bana was excellent.  Overall, I would say the acting was well above par, and the battles were fantastic.  While the story does deviate a little from the written work, it stays fairly true to the Homer epic.  The extras are also very interesting, so they are certainly worth a watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>You know, it's obvious that Troy is not entirely faithful to Homer's The Iliad. But that's not what's bad about the movie (I mean, come on. It's a fact that not every movie is true to the books they're based on). No, the biggest flaws in the movie are the casting choices. The supporting cast is really good, and Peter O'Toole is typically brilliant. However, the five major leads of the film (Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Rose Byrne, and Diane Kruger) are badly miscast. None of them fit their parts (even Pitt): they look unconvincing and undistinguished. And Brad Pitt is a pretty cool guy, but seriously, how can ANYONE picture him as Achilles? Good news, however. The look of the film is a treat. The sets look marvelous, the battle scenes are well-staged, and the CGI effects actually look realistic.<br /><br />I'm kind of mixed about this film. I dislike the main performances and the music. But at the same time, I like everything else in the film. I'll give this a C+, because I don't exactly dislike the entire film. I just wish they chose some better actors for the main characters.<br /><br />Grade: C+</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>Nifty special affects, a massive budget, big stars and bared flesh do not make a film worth watching if the characters do not interest me. And the characters in "Troy" are about as flat and two-dimensional as they come. Vain, horny Trojan Prince Paris (pretty Orlando Bloom) falls for sulky, kept-woman Helen (almost-as-pretty Diane Kruger), which pisses off her husband, Spartan ruler Menelaus, and gives his megalomaniacal brother Agamemnon (Brian Cox, always playing the a-hole) an excuse to invade Troy. Achilles (a buff Brad Pitt) agrees to help, not because he cares, but just because he has a hang-up about having his name in the history books, and Paris' brother Hector (studly Aussie Eric Bana) and father King Priam (a dazed and confused Peter O'Toole) both sacrifice their lives and happiness for the sake of Paris' bratty antics.<br /><br />"Troy" glorifies violence and aggressiveness, while dubiously suggesting that love and family are what's really important. With the exception of maybe Bana's Hector, the "great" and "epic" characters are all arrogant, whiny and selfish brats. All this I could forgive somehow, if "Troy" didn't commit the worst sin of all when it comes to big-budget, Hollywood films ... being boring.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>This film is a beautiful show though it will not in anyway change the face of the world. It shows that war is a horrible adventure in which motivations are absolutely perverse, perverted and hypocritical. One goes to war for a woman who was stolen from him. Women are nothing but homestead possessions. One goes to war to increase his power by conquering people who resist him. War is a power game that is won or lost after many deaths of soldiers and civilians who are not supposed to question any point but only to obey. War is blind obedience for the soldiers and blind submission for the civilians. One goes to war for the pleasure of fighting to show his prowess, his courage, his ? invincibility ? and yet he will be killed in the heart of victory because no one is invincible, no war is a clean parade on an empty boulevard. Then supplementary motivations appear during the fighting or the discussions and rivalries among chiefs. It is such events, like the killing of a cousin, the manhandling of a prisoner, or any dramatic event, that can change the course of a war and bring into the battle people who wanted to remain neutral. War is a big pot in which spiders and predators are cooking, some enemies, some allies. Finally most soldiers are going into the war with only one objective : looting and taking advantage of the situation to satisfy their basic and repulsive instincts to hurt, torture, maim and enjoy the barbarity of such acts. Finally a war is always lost in the long run and the victors are vanquished as Handel would say in Alexander's Feast. A few of the princes of Troy will escape and they will create Rome who will eventually conquer Greece and submit them to their power. History is always a vengeful game if the will, interests and peace of the people are not taken into account. Finally a war can only be won through a genocide : kill all your enemies and you will carry the day. This film is the exposure of war as a crime against humanity. Yet there are in this film a few, very few, but a few nevertheless, scenes that redeem such horror. The ? invincible ? Achilles is vanquished by a sudden and unexplainable love that leads him into a mistake and a trap, and there is no escape, no pardon, no tolerance, no considering the honorable actions of before. He is an enemy, so he has to be killed. Everyone will like the Trojan horse immensely that shows a war is always won through perfidy, ruse, deception and the exploitation of the gullibility of the opponents. Nothong has changed except that we are more conscious and sensitive to crime and perverse actions, and that we have media who will expose any tresspassing from some guideline. War is based on lies but the media have the responsibility to expose such lies and when they are exposed the war is lost for the liars who are exposed as such at the same time. Yet the film is short on the real stakes of this war : the control of eastern commercial routes and the danger such a strategic position represents for those who are thus controlled by this commercial power.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>The best movie of 2004 yet, and one of the best epics ever.

I've got a hangover." Hair of the dog later, Achilles gets himself to the gig. "I should kick your a**, kid!" Yells Aggy. "Oh, yeah, well your mouthwash ain't makin' it", Achilles comes back with. With a nonchalance Perry Como would envy, Achilles legs it towards the giant. Drop kick. Blinding left 'ook. Our 'enry goes face down. Sorted. Well, that's me sold on the film. I liked classical civilization as a kid and my sister says I've been in the closet longer than a geriatric moth, so it wasn't even a hard sell. <p>Brad Pitt is the business in this film. He plays Achilles as a living spear, and as you know a spear has two sides (this is where the review collapses into pretension.) When he gets a visit from a grieving father, his face crumples as if to say "don't lay this heavy trip on me, dude!" Remember Pitt's mannered performance in SE7EN? He no longer acts like he's got something to prove and the result is entertaining.<p>There's very little I don't like about this film. The sacking of Troy is deflated by an elegiac soundtrack. There's one of those long winded death scenes where they turn down the volume and the cast of thousands suddenly disappear to the John. When Hector exits stage left, a lot of the film's heart goes with him. Not really a criticism, as the same happens in real life when a great warrior checks out. Apart from that, this is one of the best films I've seen. The spectacle and violence is staggering. See it while you can on as big a screen as you can find because I've a hunch it's not going to be around for long, judging by the poor turn out. On a personal note, I'd just like to say I'm a bit of an Achilles. Every day an existential crisis, but will deliver the goods when necessary. No, really. look, Gary does mean 'spearman' in Anglo-Saxon, you know. I got a bright orange mug for Christmas that says so.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK.html">A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK</a><br/><p>Troy is easily an hour too long.  Seems they were taking the meaning of epic very seriously.  If they weren't going to make a good film, then at least they would make a long one.<p>Not all of Troy is so bad.  The action sequences are entertaining.  Most of the visuals are pretty good.  OK, that's about it.  The rest is normal Hollywood summer film fodder.  Big stars in a low-substance film.  Pretty boys abound here so the ladies won't be disappointed.<p>Brad Pitt is, at best, a mediocre actor.  He scored big in 12 monkeys, but that was oh so long ago.  No one pouts better than him.  No one looks more handsome wielding a sword.  Still, don't look for Mr. Pitt around Oscar time.  <p>I'm pretty disappointed with Orlando Bloom.  The fact that he uses a bow and arrow in Troy doesn't separate him from his Legolas role does it?  This elf should try his hand at some serious roles and leave action behind for awhile.</p></br><a href="../users/APP5MBH2BSX6I.html">APP5MBH2BSX6I</a><br/><p>Many milennia ago, so far back that even historians can't pin it down, a man named Homer apparently wrote an epic Greek tragedy entitled "The Iliad."  Even that isn't entirely sure.  The existence of Troy, even longer ago, is a bit more sure, as is the belief that said Troy was involved in a war like the one depicted in this film.  Other than those generally accepted facts, it isn't known how much of "The Iliad" is myth or reality, although some of the characters are Greek gods and goddesses, which makes it easier to figure which parts of Homer's story might be myth.  So, let's not get all worked up about how historically accurate this film is, OK?<br /><br />Those who know something about "The Iliad" will at least be interested to see how director Wolfgang Petersen and the staff of this production demythologize the story of Achilles, his heel, the Trojan horse, the man for whom Paris is named, and Helen of Troy whose face launched a thousand ships.  Many have had little good to say about the adaptation.  I'll say some good things, however.<br /><br />For one, I bought Brad Pitt in the role of Achilles, although his character has been overwhelmingly modernized, like almost everything else in this version of the ancient tale.  A loner, the world's greatest warrior, iconoclast, apathetic in the extreme where politics is concerned, Achilles is presented as the kind of character who might say the modern line, "The men want to be me and the women want to be with me."  Along the lines of eye candy for the guys, there's Diane Kruger, the lovely young lady who portrays Helen of Troy, her face truly worthy of seamanship on a mass scale.  Also excellent in supporting roles are Sean Bean as Achilles' adviser, Odysseus, and Brian Cox as the boastful Greek warlord Agamemnon.<br /><br />It's a story on a vast scale, a tale of love, war, and tragedy.  So, expect romantic moments, huge battle scenes, and an unhappy yet appropriate ending.<br /><br />There, however, the good news ends, for the most part.<br /><br />The memorable and gripping moments of "Troy" are also unfortunately interspersed with some truly embarrassing scenes.  One that comes to mind is when Achilles hews off the head of a golden statue with his sword.  This would be fine if he had been presented as a supernatural figure, as he was in "The Iliad," but remember, we have no gods in this film other than when their names are referenced by the all too human characters on screen.  No sword would truly hold up to a massive slab of gold, and the scene is ridiculous as a result.  Even worse are some incredibly melodramatic moments early in the film where a character's closeup is actually held for a couple of seconds while the film is switched to slo-mo until fadeout.  Nothing could possibly be more cornball, except perhaps the dialogue.  Julie Christie, in a cameo as Achilles' mother, is forced to spew some of the most horrid dialogue heard in recent years.  Scenes like hers set the motion picture industry back 50 years to the days of the hamminess of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.  Yeech.<br /><br />And then there's the late great Peter O'Toole.  Oh, sorry, he's not dead?  Well, he looks it.  Aside from a touching scene in private with Pitt's Achilles, O'Toole, as the king of Troy, is seemingly one step away from the nursing home, both in looks and actions.  He's barely recognizable, the poor old sot.  Yet another parable about the destructive powers of strong drink, that man.<br /><br />And the battle scenes are so "Lord Of the Rings"-like as to be blatantly obvious even to those who haven't seen any of the LOtR films.  It was once clever to computerize a few hundred extras and replicate them to become many thousands, but now it just looks cheesy.  Or maybe that's just "Troy" working its questionable magic again.<br /><br />By the end of the film I was really unsure whether to be glad it was over, savor the occasional satisfying scene, or be sickened at the way the memorable fable of Achilles' heel is turned into almost nothing.  Upon further review, it's a bit of both.  "Troy" really has some fine moments and also some that are laughably bad.  Please don't take the film seriously, and you just might enjoy it as a rental.  I would not recommend a purchase.  "Das Boot," Petersen's first film to make an international splash, remains his best work by far, "The Perfect Storm" notwithstanding.</p></br><a href="../users/A19OQ7LWE2YJL3.html">A19OQ7LWE2YJL3</a><br/><p>I was so sick of Brad Pitt's puffy face by the end of this movie.  He was in practically every scene and it really ruined the movie for me.  The story wasn't developed enough, Branna's part as Hector was fabulous and his portrayal was fabulous.  Orlando Bloom's character Paris was downright cowardly, foppish and almost dislikable.<br /><br />I really felt the part of Achilles was badly played, and it was very hard to believe Brad Pitt was this great warrior.  He's just not the type.  He was too small and not believable at all that he could be beating all those men.<br /><br />See another epic, see Gladiator or even Braveheart, over this.  I hope it does not kill Branna's career.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ENN25NFADE1X.html">A3ENN25NFADE1X</a><br/><p>Wolfgang Peterson spends 170 million dollars to turn our heros into boring Greek gods. Brad Pitt(Fight Club) is a great actor, but the demension he tries to ad to his character Achillies, the more he fails. What we don't know is that Achillies was in love with his cousin, and when his cousin dies, Brad show's no emotion, he just wimps. Orlando Bloom doesn't really do anything, in fact his whole career is not doing anything. In "Lord Of The Ring" he doesn't do anything, but he showed that he cared for his friends, and the girls loved him. But there is no acting in this movie, just action, action, mindless action, to be honest with you, the real actors are Peter O, Toole and Eric Banner. But thats not saying much, but Peter does save the film in some odd way.<br /><br />"Troy" has ended up like "The Alamo", same situation, and with the same outcome, the audience is sick and tired of war films, especially with no accurate details of what happened. In "Lawrence Of Arabia", the film is driven by silence, acting and beauty, but then again David Lean was a genius, and Wolfgang Peterson did only one good film(The Perfect Storm). And the battle scenes are terrible, and repentative. I was very dissapointed. Hail to "Gladiator."</p></br><a href="../users/AESY8NCX6VS6O.html">AESY8NCX6VS6O</a><br/><p>The whole Iliad deal is kind of an acquired taste. We get it shoved down our throats in high school, forced to read hastily assembled excerpts in literature books, get told it's a hugely important historical document, and then move on to Romeo and Juliet and The Catcher in the Rye. I somewhat had the same "oh-please-God-not-again" feeling toward the Iliad when I had to read it again for a Humanities class this past fall quarter, but I have to say that not only did I gain a new understanding of it, but a new respect of it. What that old, blind poet of old sang to the Greeks is truly transcendent - the anger, the honor, the forgiveness, the humility of it all. So why does Wolfgang Petersen&#8217;s Troy completely throw everything decent about its source material right out the window?<p>  Take your seats for two hours and forty-three excruciatingly boring moments and watch one of the most enduring works of mortal creativity get sodomized like there's no freaking tomorrow. And unfortunately, that's pretty much the impression that you'll be getting right off the bat. Petersen's bloated, simperingly stupid film doesn't even put up any pretence of trying to make a stand-alone work that honors its source material in any way - it launches into the fight scenes, the awkward dialogue, and the wooden acting right away. <p>  It's not just Pitt, who is horrifically miscast here, or Orlando Bloom (obviously just a way to reel in LOTR fans), or Cox, or Sean Bean (wasn't he in LOTR too?), or poor, poor Peter O'Toole (I hope he got paid a lot for this) - it's David Benioff's script at the heart of the problem. Nearly every character, in the onset of the film, makes some reference to the fact that the ensuing action will be remembered for thousands of years. This pretty much stops the movie dead in its tracks (which is sad, because there's a whole two more hours to endure by then), for it's a desperate attempt to inform the audience that just because it's based off of Homer, it's automatically supposed to be grand and heroic. Homer's epic was fascinating because the characters felt like real people, with real personal struggles and real motivations. This movie...well, forget it. I'm not even gonna get into how much it ravages the source material - you get my idea.<p>  And don't even get me started on the fight scenes. Petersen stages every single battle with the same exact tone - men getting killed left and right didn't solicit a raised eyebrow, a wince, or even a muscle movement from me. The men fighting and dying for Greece and Troy are no-name bodies that charge forward with copious digital assistance. And the ones with names are even more of a problem.<p>  As I said before, the dialogue is laughably horrible, but none of it is manifested to more of a disgusting effect than with Brad Pitt as Achilles. This is, without a doubt, one of the single worst performances I have ever seen in a movie. He can't find an accent, every word comes through with the same defiant tone - if this guy can act, he certainly isn't proving his case here. It's quite clear deep into the movie that the Homerian epic was merely a little side issue that Benioff and Petersen needed to inserted. The real motive of this movie is to get a bunch of attractive men together and show them off for unfortunate audience members that will sadly sit through this.<p>  If you're not throwing up profusely by about hour two, just wait until a melodramatic love story involving Achilles gets thrown into the mix. I have to admit, I never liked the movie, but getting into the final stretch, I simply became angry. This is one of the biggest wastes of money, talent, and ambition I have ever seen. Troy goes on and on and on and on, doesn't even stop where the original Iliad does (because, of course, it's not about the Iliad, it's about Brad Pitt), and is so fatally overlong I nearly cried. There are only three minutes or so of this movie that actually work, and they are when Peter O'Toole, as Priam, visits Achilles near the end of the film to demand something (I won't go into specifics, but I imagine most of you know the deal). A stunningly accomplished actor wasted for most of the movie, he gets to knock it out of the park briefly as he begs on his knees before Pitt's Achilles. By this time, I was so angry at the movie that every time Pitt's face hit the screen I just closed my eyes - it's obvious that this isn't Priam just begging to Achilles for a deserved possession back. This is Peter O'Toole, freaking LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, imploring Brad Pitt as to why the heck he's in such a mess.<p>  I simply can't even begin to tell you how much I hated this movie. While watching it, I suddenly longed for even mediocre epics, like Braveheart. I wanted to see the complexity of Lawrence of Arabia, the stunning acting of Gladiator, the perfectly tuned campiness of The Ten Commandments - things this movie lacks to an embarassing level. You know, there are people out there who are losing their faith in the future of the movies, and after watching Troy, I can realize that they may have something. This complete trainwreck, one of the worst I've ever seen, wasted not only money that could have been spent on something else, but nearly three hours of my time, and I am SO angry. I want to remind director Wolfgang Petersen that maybe he should listen to things that the characters say in his movie. For example, when the Trojan Horse is introduced about 2 hours and 30 minutes into this bile-bucket, Paris says, "Burn it." Oh, if only.

That kept in mind, this massive film has spectacle and beauty, and the feel and often the look of the great sword and sandal epics of the 1950s. Filmed in Mexico and Malta, the cinematography is a feast for the eyes, and there is wonderful detail in some of the lavish costuming and art direction. The romantic aspects of the story have been thankfully minimized, and the film focuses on the courage and heroism, as well as the lust for power and carnage of war.<br /><br />There are many excellent performances throughout, and I especially enjoy Eric Bana as Hector, and Sean Bean as Odysseus. Orlando Bloom is good as Paris, as are Peter O'Toole as Priam, Brendan Gleeson as Menelaus, Brian Cox as Agamemnon, Rose Byrne as Briseis, Vincent Regan as Eudorus, and a short but lovely appearance by Julie Christie as Achilles' mother, Thetis. Brad Pitt looks like a golden god and is believable as the larger than life Achilles, and is fantastic in the fight scenes. The brilliantly choreographed battle between Achilles and Hector is memorable, and has to be one of the best mano a mano action sequences in film history.<br /><br />Some of the loveliest music written today is for film, and James Horner has outdone himself in "Troy," with the gorgeous song "Remember Me," sung by Josh Groban, and the atmospheric voices of Tanja Tzarovska and Desislava Stefanova woven throughout the score. Wolfgang Peterson's sweeping direction, the cinematography of Paul Bond and Roger Pratt, and the script by David Benioff make this satisfying, and often riveting viewing, and it's a film that should be seen multiple times to fully appreciate. Total running time is 163 minutes.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>I'm really going to forgive some massive fundamental flaws and applaud this fun epic popcorn flick.  Obviously, and it is assumed that like many cinephiles, I have a major problem with Troy's very existence to the core.  Consider for a minute that the likes of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W8OM5Y">Braveheart</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009PLLN6">Alexander</a> are called "historical fiction" but they are based on people we know existed.  Troy is based on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140275363">The Iliad </a> but it works in such a way that the audience is possibly being urged to believe these were real events.  So the film in essence is based on the possible events that took place during the Trojan War.  In fact, it doesn't even stay particularly true to The Iliad but it does try to capture the icons associated with the Trojan War and at the very least it keeps in tone with The Iliad, especially with regards to the violence in its battle sequences and the portrayal of Achilles' wrath.  However, no gods or mythical figures to speak of and that is, at the very least an indirect attempt to steer the audience from believing that this is fiction.  Maybe it is just because so many other epic films released are based on some degree of truth.  Troy is based on myths and that's alright if you want to portray it that way.  2004's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MQ58WC">King Arthur</a> had the same problem but with less CGI.  Troy has a lot of CGI and it cost $180 million to make.  They didn't need to stretch so far for believability but like I said, some movies are just worth forgiving.  This is eye candy; it is Hollywood to the bone.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I liked Troy and it looks incredible on blu-ray.  The director's cut includes extra battle cuts, extra nudity, and it even has some scenes that assist in character development.  The extra footage is actually seamless and makes the movie far longer but also far better and if there is an epic film made for superior visual technology like blu-ray, Troy is just that film.  There is no pretending here, Troy is a true Hollywood production and I actually mean that with at least some degree of affection.  The cast is great and includes of course Brad Pitt as the seemingly invincible and infinitely angry Achilles, Brian Cox as one of the film's real villains in Agamemnon, Eric Bana plays the heroic Trojan warrior Hector, Sean Bean plays Odysseus, Peter O'Toole plays Priam with fitting melodrama, Tyler Mane plays the chaotic and violent Ajax, and the very beautiful Diane Kruger plays Helen; the face that launched a thousand ships, or was it her breasts?  All are good in their roles but no one seems to take themselves too seriously and for the most part their performances, or in some cases just their presence, work within the film.<br /><br />The battle scenes in Troy are huge and absolutely second to none. There are tons of battle scenes within this 196 minute Director's cut and they just keep on going while getting more and more exciting and out of control.  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000244F7I">soundtrack</a> for Troy is clearly an upgrade from the theatrical version and makes the battle scenes seem even larger as it booms and powers in and out of great sky shots over the beginnings, middles, and ends of various battles.  The cinematography and visual effects, whether the fake kind or the real kind, look absolutely amazing on blu-ray and the great shots never cease in Troy.  The music is huge, the drama is huge, and the visuals are even bigger.  It is visually one of the most impressive blu-rays so far and that is because it is a visually driven film to begin with.  Troy truly is epic in every sense of the word.  Well, except for that whole idea of it being based on an epic poem.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4.html">A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4</a><br/><p>As much as Harry Potter and Spider Man 2 would love to be the standout film , noone can forget this films money shot of the so<br />overwhemingly massive Spartan fleet heading twords Troy and with<br />an international cast like Brad Pitt,Eric Bana,Brian Cox,Orlando<br />Bloom,Peter O Toole and Diane Kruger why wouldn't this obviously<br />be the summers standout film.<p>  The 2800 year old historical/legend tells of two worlds the<br />prestine legendary Trojan empire who is gaurded by one of the<br />most awsome warriors Hector(Eric Bana)and ruled by king Priam<br />(Peter O Toole)and the vast empire of military might Sparta ,<br />who has the most legendary and greatist warrior Akiles(Brad<br />Pitt)and is ruled by Agamemnon king of Sparta.But Sparta has<br />something that Troy does not Helen Queen of Sparta(Diane Kruger),<br />who illicitly betrays her king and has a love affair with Paris<br />Of Troy(Orlando Bloom), Agmemnon's brother Melanius has chosen<br />Helen for his brother the prize is no less then Helen who's<br />beauty is unmatched , but as there love affair starts between<br />Helen and Paris when it is discoverd King Priam is upset at<br />Paris , but in Sparta it is looked on with a much larger reaction as an act of war between the two nations and<br />Agamenon request some of his greatist warriors to go to<br />him to war.<p>  Odyssus(Sean Bean)and Melanus but also calls on the great<br />warrior Akiles(Brad Pitt).Priam knowing full well that a war<br />is brewing gives Hector and order to protect Paris and Troy<br />at all costs.Agamemnon soon launches the massive Spartan fleet<br />of 1000 ships and 5 legions to Troy,Paris and Helens love affair<br />will ignite the 10 year Trojan war and will seal the fate two<br />of the greatist titans that have ever lived to clash in battle<br />between Akiles and Hector,who Akiles sees if he can win both<br />Helen and Troy that he will become legendary.<p>  200 million dollars has went into this film making it one of the most expensive films of all time.Buliding a 1/2 scale of the<br />city of troy , 5 Spartan warships, numerious coustume design and<br />being able to make the old classic 50's and 60's epic look to the film and not to mention the battle scene between Hector and<br />Akiles that is said to be on a scale from 1 - 10 a sure fire 10<br />and could possibly be an academy award contender for early next year a huge summer film.</p></br><a href="../users/A17N23WXA7EAF.html">A17N23WXA7EAF</a><br/><p>I just saw Troy last night and I've got to say that it was more gay than "Gladiator". Yes, both films show scantily-clad, muscle men sweating, getting dirty, duking it out and professing love of one thing or another.<br /><br />In "Gladiator", the homo-erotic components is a little more subtle. Maximus is totally hot and Commodus is not. Commodus' dad, Marcus Aurelius has sublimated home-or-sect-chew-all attraction for Maximus and of course Maximus responds to it positively by going out onto the battle field with nothing more than a jock strap and some armor in order to cut off some German heads. Commodus is jealous and so he kills his dad, but then he wants to assume his father's role by consumating his (and his father's) attraction to Maximus. At first this takes the form of a loyalty enticement but when Maximus rebuffs this, Commodus unleashes a chain of murderous events that result in Maxiums performing in the Colloseum with a jock strap and some armor, a lot of tight, sweaty muscle men and even a few animals. Go Maximus! Anyway, Commodus transforms himself from observer to participant by doing a little disabling S&M routine on Maximus and then playing with him in the arena which is both scripted homo-erotic behavior and flagrant exhibitionism. So much for "Gay-ladiator".<br /><br />"Troy" ambitiously sets out to out-gay "Gladiator". From the beginning  the eye of the homo-erotic hurricane is Achilles played by Brad Pitt. My what a bad boy Achilles is. He's late for battle with Thesaly because he's sleeping in late (nood) with a couple of Ancient Greek chicks who look like a couple of Ancient Greek boys. This movie is clever about that because it gives the chicks the same hair style as the little servant boy and fails to show their distinctive feminine traits such as their love tunnels, fun seats, and chest-o-plenty.<br /><br />Achilles shows up at the battle field where he performs homo erotic combat with a total leather man from Thesaly. Then he goes home and plays with his cute little cousin, whacking wooden swords around and giggling while wearing cute blue dresses and having his hair sort of braided in blue.<br /><br />Then it's off to Troy which might as well be a gay disco spread out on the beach at day light. BOM PID DEEEEE, BOM PID DEEEE, BOM BOM BOM will you just look at all those scantily clad muscle men charging around on the beach and jumping on and stabbing each other!<br /><br />Ever the narcisist, it isn't enough for Achilles merely to do Hector. He also has to drag his body around the city wall behind his chariot boasting in a sort of modern prison movie manner, "Yeah, Hector: I DID him!" Achilles also shows as much of his nude body as he can get away with AND...<br /><br />  he shows his sweet sensitve side not to mention his pouty bad boy nature.<br /><br />Oh and that combat scene between delicate little Paris and husky, aggressive Meneleus--c'mon. Gay! Gay! Gay! It's soooooooo gay!<br /><br />Not that there's anything wrong with that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z5WEA0KOMN9G.html">A2Z5WEA0KOMN9G</a><br/><p>You'll love this movie.

In the past I have put together a unit on the Trojan War that included not only Homer's epic poem the "Iliad," but also the plays of Euripides and Aeschylus and other ancient works on the stories of these characters. In other words I am familiar with this story to the extent that when Briseis showed up wearing a garment with long sleeves I was upset that we did not get to see the lovely arms that were part of her usual epithet. So, suffice it to say, that when characters who survived the Trojan War started dying in this film, I was not exactly happy. Consequently, the truth is that the less you know about the Trojan War of classical mythology, the more you will enjoy Wolfgang Petersen's "Troy."<br /><br />I have no problem with the idea that Homer and the other ancients have to be adapted in making a modern motion picture about the Trojan War. The decision to eliminate the gods is appropriate, getting away from the idea that this was a ten year war certainly makes sense, and if the alliance of the Greeks is now political rather than as part of an oath sworn by the princes who were suitors for Helen's hand, I consider that tlegitimate. I do not understand why Iphigenia, Cassandra, and Hecuba are all eliminated but they are not fatal omissions. But when you start rewriting who gets killed that is going a bit too far, especially when one premature death starts a chain effect that means Athens will never develop the jury system, which means we probably lose out on it too. David Benioff's screenplay was "inspired" by Homer's "Iliad," which at least is an honest way to characterize what he did in this script, but I still do not have to like it or endorse it.<br /><br />The big selling point for this film was not Homer but rather Brad Pitt as Achilles. Stories abound about how Pitt worked six months to get in shape for this film, gave up smoking, and ended up hurting his Achilles tendon in one of those profound ironies that indicates that maybe the gods were not pleased with what was happening in this film. Pitt certainly looks good, not just in terms of taking several opportunities to display the line of his nude body, but in how he carries himself as Achilles. The whole idea is that this guy is the greatest warrior on the face of the planet and Pitt exudes that with the way he strides across the sands of Troy. Even more impressive is the choreography for the fights, because Pitt's movements are so smooth and powerful, especially compared with that of Eric Bana's Hector, that you do not doubt that this guy is in a league by himself as a warrior. I also like the way he uses the distinctive form of his shield when fighting. They thought this part out quite a bit.<br /><br />The fight choreography was worked out by Simon Crane, the film's stunt coordinator and second unit director, who describes Achilles as fighting with a boxing style but with the velocity of a speed skater and the agility of a panther. They also come up with a nice touch in that Achilles looks slightly to the side at his opponent until he is ready to come in for the kill. The best fight sequences of "Troy" are when Achilles is fighting. The giant battle sequences of computerized soldiers are not as impressive, mainly because the camera is always in motion and the cutting is so fast that we are left with an impression of the battle rather than always being able to tell what is going on (which has become my constant complaint with most movies with large battle sequences).<br /><br />Bana does a good job of capturing Hector's nobility without turning him into a marble statue, while Peter O'Toole fills the role of Priam naturally. On the Trojan side the problematic character is Paris (Orlando Bloom), again because of the writing more than the performance. Priam has negotiated peace between Troy and the Sparta of King Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), but that is destroyed when Paris persuades Helen (Diane Kruger) to run away with him. Both Hector and Priam know that Paris is wrong and their reasons for supporting him and thereby dooming Troy ring hollow (the less than stellar "Helen of Troy" television miniseries did a nice job of providing a solid motivation for the Trojans to protect Helen).<br /><br />It you want to draw a clear distinction between Homer's story of Achilles and that of Benioff it is that the former is about the rage of Achilles (see the first line of the "Iliad") and the latter adds an equally strong love element. The one character whose role is most inflated in this version is that of Briseis (Rose Byrne), the Trojan slave girl who comes between Achilles and Agamemnon (Brian Cox), the king of kings for the Greeks. This change becomes the reasoning behind how the film rewrites the end game of the Trojan War, although I still do not understand why some of the key characters get to live happily ever after. But since Pitt's performance dominates the film and he is clearly the horse that director Wolfgang Petersen is riding to make the whole thing work, it makes sense that he has to be around until the very end.<br /><br />Each semester about a third of my students take the option to compare "Troy" to what they know about Homer's "Iliad" and the mythology of the Trojan War.  Most of them take exception to the changes as well, which I find interesting because most of them saw the movie before they got around to reading "what really happened."  I have expanded their options to include the recent "Helen of Troy" mini-series, but "Troy" is still their favorite target.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N.html">A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N</a><br/><p>This film wasn't as great as it was advertise,but it was WAY better than Oliver Stone's Alexander.Mostly because they were trying to pull off that "epic" film feel and they did.The action/fight scenes were done very well.Just enough blood to satisfy the "gore" fanatics out there.The story moved steadily and didn't  tred in one place too long.I have to hand it to Bradd Pitt,he muscled up for the part although it seemed as though there was some overacting done by him and some of the other actors.They sure did grease up Brad though,it looked like he was bathed in olive oil for every scene.Yuck!Good with food,bad on Brad.<br /><br /> Orlando Bloom was a sissy.I think they could have prortrayed him less as a wimp in love with Helen of Troy and more like a guy that could stand on his own.Maybe they were trying to be historically acurate to the Greek fable,but I found it annoying to hear him wimper and go on about how his love for Helen was so deep,he would sacrifice himself for her then get his ass kicked in by an old fart he should have cut to ribbons.I thought his older brother should have gutted him and thrown him over the boat in the begining of the film.<br /><br /> Lastly,was Eric Banna.He was (next to Brad) the highlight of this film.He really carried this film character wise.He is really turning out to be one hell of an actor,and well deserved.The next Russel Crowe?Maybe?If you want to see a bad ass film with Eric Banna,see "Chopper"(skip The Hulk).Some people liked Chopper,others did'nt but it was a fantastic film with brilliant acting done on his part.All in all,looks wise,story/plot....Troy was a good,watchable film.Perhaps a bit long,but hey...isn't that why they call them epics?Its well worth watching the one time,I'm not sure I'd want to own it.Boycott Alexander,it was a piece of S*&%#!@#%&!</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>The director of this film made a wise decision: make this retelling of the story of the Trojan war realistic for modern audiences. The original Illiad by Homer (on which this movie is based) is full of gods and goddesses playing with the human characters as if they were puppets. By cutting out all the gods and goddesses, we have a more clean to-the-point epic of ambition, power, love, and warfare. The characters are dirty, sweaty human beings and as fellow human beings we recognize the struggles they face.<br /><br />Some of the great themes of literature are raised in this film. One of these is the nature of leadership. What a wonderful contrast in leadership we see between Achilles ( a beautiful killing machine), Agamemnon (a ego maniac constantly consolidating power), Ullyses (a wise manipulating survivor),  King Priam (a patrician who trusts the gods), and Hector (a loving family man of character who unfortunately must face the demi-god Achilles in mortal combat).<br /><br />There is a price for editing out all the gods (Apollo, Athena,Juno, Neptune, and Aphrodite) in that the manipulations of the gods explain the motives of some of the characters. For example, when Paris selects Aphrodite as the most beautiful of the goddesses, his prize (or bribe) is that the most beautiful women in the world will love him upon first sight. Helen (herself a demi-god since she is the daughter of Zeus and Leda) is that woman and we are never convinced in the film that this woman would leave her husband for the young pretty boy, Paris.<br /><br />We also don't understand the sacrifice Agamemnon made to the war. The gods would not give him winds for his fleet until he sacrificed his daughter, Iphegenia. This messy scene was never shown.<br /><br />Also, the link between Ulysses and Achilles is never explained. Remember that it is the trickster Ulysses who finds the adolescent Achilles hidden in women's clothes because his mother knows he will die a warrior.<br /><br />The acting was very good. Peter O'Toole as King Priam was a standout. Orlando Bloom and Eric Bana as the brothers Paris and Hector were superb. Saffron Burrows as Hector's suffering wife Andromache conveyed the personal and national crisis of Hector's death.<br /><br />But what was the best scene in the film?  The scene where King Priam comes to Achilles tent in the enemy camp to beg for his son's mangled body so that it might be washed and given a burial. O'Toole plays the role perfectly of a patrician,noble old man who has lost his beloved son and must now beg the killer for the corpse. Pitt does a good job of showing a man who was consumed with his own anger and grief begin the process of healing by discovering compassion and empathy within himself.<br /><br />And what was the best line in the film?  As Hector leaves his family to go outside the city gates to face Achilles, his father King Priam, puts his hands on his son's shoulders and says: "No man has ever had a finer son that you have been to me." These are the words every son wishes to hear his father say, unfortunately sometimes it takes crisis for us to open our hearts.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ.html">A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ</a><br/><p>OVERVIEW: Most national newspaper reviews were average at best for "Troy" (2004). I went into this movie not expecting much - which was probably the best way to go. I had several years of latin & mythology in high school and college and liked the subject matter in general (though I don't claim to be a Greek historian as some writers here seem to be). I knew most of the players here, but I don't think it's essential to know them going in. You quickly know that this movie is depicting a battle between two very distinct sides (Greeks vs Trojans). I think if you enjoy movies and like to be entertained by Hollywood - you'll enjoy "Troy". However, if you go into this film expecting things to unfold how historian's have documented - you'll be sorely disappointed. This is the Reader's Digest 'condensed' version of a 10 year war - taking place over about 2 weeks. "Troy" fits in nicely with the other ancient era/period movies like "Ben Hur", "Clash Of The Titans", "Spartacus", "Ulysses", "Hercules", "The Odyssey", "Jason & The Argonauts", "Gladiator", and even Marlon Brando's "Julius Caesar".<br /><br />THE GOOD: Director Wolfgang Peterson ("The Perfect Storm", "Air Force One", "Das Boot", "In The Line Of Fire") has the reputation for making a good action film. He does not disappoint in making "Troy". There are some truly great battle scenes featured here; a great fight between the lead characters of the Greek Achilles and the Trojan Hector. There is also some wonderful scenery - the vast many ships out on the Aegean Sea, the huge walls around the city of Troy, the sweeping shots of the armies on the beach as well as outside the great entrance to Troy's city. The male cast is exceptional. Brad Pitt as the ultimate warrior Achilles; Eric Bana as the patriotic Hector; Orlando Bloom perfectly playing wimpy Paris; Peter O'Toole as Troy's King Priam; Brian Cox as the loathsome Greek King Agamemnon; Sean Bean as supportive Odysseus. The story revolves around Paris stealing Menelaus' wife (Helen) and bringing her back to Troy. Menelaus wants her back and decides to go to his brother (Agamemnon) to fight for her. Turns out Agamemnon isn't so much in it for his brother as much as he wants to conquer Troy itself. Enter Paris running away from Menelaus, Hector killing Menelaus, Agamemnon declaring war, lots of fighting, a Trojan Horse, a city on fire, and so on. History books tell us the Trojan War lasted 10 years. "Troy" appears to last about 2 weeks. While there were some great scenes in "Troy" - Achilles battling Hector, King Priam sneaking into Achilles tent and asking for his dead son's body back for a proper burial, the hundreds of ships in the Aegean Sea arriving on the Trojan shores, the whole Trojan horse scene - there are several things that prevent me from giving this movie a higher rating.<br /><br />THE NOT SO GOOD: Brad Pitt was good, but not great. Some of his lines were just not convincing. His choreographed fight scenes seemed somewhat labored. His death scene was uneventful. His pecks and abs looked fine (as my wife would agree). Pitt was no Russell Crowe (in "Gladiator"), or Mel Gibson (in "Braveheart")... not even close. I like Pitt, and loved his lunacy in "Fight Club", "12 Monkeys" and "Seven" - perhaps "Troy" was too 'calm' for him. Most of the females in this movie were disappointing. The main female was Helen (Diane Kruger). A somewhat limp and feeble woman - I was expecting a stronger character role here - one that wasn't so love-struck or sobbing so dang much. As good as Brian Cox was as Agamemnon, I felt he was too short for this movie. Anything I've ever read in mythology said Agamemnon was monsterous in size. I recognized several 2nd and 3rd tier actors in "Troy" that had played supporting roles in the similar era/period type movies "Braveheart" and "Gladiator". The soundtrack was also very reminiscent of "Gladiator". The 2-disc DVD set was overkill. I guess with 2 discs, I somehow expect a boat-load of extras. Not so here - the six DVD extras here total about 50 minutes. Included is the trailer, a language choice selection, "Gallery Of the Gods" (giving a brief history lesson on 12 Greek Gods - from Apollo to Zeus), a battle and a historical perspective, and a special effects odyssey (rubber swords et all). While the DVD extras were good and gave a keen look inside the making of the film, they were by no mean extensive. All of this could have easily fit on one disc. At 162 minutes, prepare for a good sit with plenty of popcorn and a Coke. "Troy" falls into the ranks of the mega-blockbusters with its $200+ million budget. It did well at the box office for several weeks, but then fell way short of it's projected in take ($)... thus, in my prediction, dooming it come Oscar time (3.5 stars).</p></br></body></html>

Ben Affleck has been cast as Ryan, and he actually surprised me.  He takes over for Harrison Ford who had the part in previous films.  He was really good in the role.  He brings something new and different to the role.  I watched this movie more because of Morgan Freeman then Ben Affleck.  I know I'm dating myself, but I've been a Morgan Freeman fans since seeing him on the Electric Company on PBS.  Ryan is a rookie who helps to unravel a plot that could have the Russians and America at war with one another.  A nuclear bombs goes off in Baltimore and the two countries point the fingers at one another.  Morgan plays Affleck's boss and friend in this film , and his performance is outstanding.  There is a touch of comedy that takes the edge off in the flim, but you never lose fact of the terror and drama in the film.  I've rented this film 4 times so far.  I think I will end up buying this one to add to my collection.  It's not often I like a movie with Ben in it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>A downed Israeli jet carrying a nuclear bomb creates a suspenseful and catastrophic disaster 29 years later.  The bomb is found damaged but the fissionable material can be reformed into a new weapon.  A radical Neo-Nazi gets his hands on the old bomb and plans to remake the world.<br /><br />Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) and William Cabot the CIA Director (Morgan Freeman) are in Russia inspecting the Russian nuclear munitions facilities to assure that the bombs are being decommissioned per the STARK treaty.  Jack thinks it is odd that three Russian scientists are not at the facilities during the inspection.  The ones that are missing are just the guys you would want to have if you wanted to build a nuclear bomb.  Ryan and Cabot are invited to the Kremlin to meet the new president Alexander Nemerov who has taken over after the death of the former president of a heart attack.  The meeting is tense.<br /><br />The USA is nervous over the new Russian President and his aggressive military policies.  He even allows a chemical attack to be launched against the people in Chechnya.  Meanwhile a stray nuclear bomb in the wrong hands might just provide the catalyst to start a full blown nuclear war.....<br /><br />I liked this movie for entertainment but I have to say that I am a real fan of Tom Clancy and I did not like how the great and intense story was changed to match the cast selected and the whim of Hollywood to be politically correct.  So much was changed that it could have almost been a different story regarding the antagonist in the book versus the movie.<br /><br />One of the key aspects that made the movie good was the tremendous performance of Morgan Freeman who was spectacular as the CIA Director.  Ben Affleck also does a good job in the movie but the role he played was a bit over the top in the end of the movie.  Since I expected the movie to be like the book I read and enjoyed I lowered the rating of the movie.  If I hadn't read the book or been such a fan of Tom Clancy, I would have rated the movie higher.  I thought the movie was action filled and intense but it is like when you expect something to happen and it turns out totally different from your expectations.  Different enemy, different Jack Ryan, almost a different story.<br /><br />If you want to watch a good movie then this one is good, if you want to watch a movie with Jack Ryan like in the book, then they should have kept Harrison Ford in the story and left the storyline like the book.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>I didn't even know we had The Sum of All Fears. I just finished watching the movie with hubby, and I'm not interested. I just like the special features. Hubby likes it though.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>Ben Affleck plays Jack Ryan, CIA analyst formerly played by Harrison Ford. Morgan Freeman plays his boss, William Cabot, formerly played by James Earl Jones. Big shoes to fill, but they do a great job.<br /><br />This movie is aptly named. It comes terribly close to all-out nuclear war. The story opens when, during the 1973 Israeli war, the Israeli army launches a single plane carrying a nuclear bomb, "just in case." It is shot down over the desert, and the sand covers the bomb. Twenty-nine years later (i.e., 2002, the date the movie was made), an Arab finds the bomb and sells it to a black market arms dealer, who buys it for $400, claiming it's not worth much. The Arab has no way of knowing it is nuclear, until much later when he is dying of radiation poisoning.<br /><br />In the meantime, Ryan and Cabot make an inspection tour of the Russian nuclear facilities to observe their dis-assembling of weapons pursuant to a treaty. They note that three nuclear scientists are missing, the Russians explain one is out sick, one is on vacation, one recently died in an automobile accident. Not true, discovers the canny CIA, and tries to find the missing scientists.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the arms dealer has sold the bomb, the plutonium was taken out and those three missing scientists built a new bomb with it. Then they were shot by the people they built it for so they could not talk.<br /><br />I won't give any more away, but Ryan is truly brilliant as he discovers what happened to the plutonium, and where it came from. However, he did not track it fast enough to keep it from being used to blow up a football stadium in Baltimore in which the President was a spectator. Fortunately, a warning got through to the president soon enough that he was in Air Force One when the bomb went off. Ryan, however, was in a helicopter. By the way, Ryan's girlfriend is a physician who works in a Baltimore hospital, so all the while he's running around trying to save the world, he doesn't know if she's alive or not.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K.html">A2BSZPRBKYAB2K</a><br/><p>This is truely a great movie from when the suspense begins to the end.  I wont get into the details since it has been reviewed on here before.  Let me just say that it kept my interest in finding out if Russia and the U.S. "push the nuclear button" as the tension rises.  One standout in this great movie is Liev Schriber, what a great actor!  Also Morgan Freeman, Ben Affleck, Bridget Monohan, and others make this a great action and tense filled movie.  One last thought, if people think this movie and plot is a little far fetched, then remember what happened on 9/11.  Before that happened, people probably thought that would NEVER happen as well.  One final note, it is too bad that Tom Clancy (who's book the movie is based on) is an arogant jerk.  I met this person at a book signing in the early 1990's.  What a disappointment.  The man is a "know it all" who really knows far less than he thinks.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>The problem I have with this film is that it isn't thorough enough to really make an impact, and so it wastes some charisma and top-notch special effects on a plot that feels underdeveloped and tiring.  It bounds with clich&eacute;s and doesn't deliver anything truly noteworthy, and so it becomes stagnant and forgettable.  Ben Affleck has charm, sure, and he can act (to a degree) but both Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin handled this character far better than Affleck, who appeared in most scenes to be out of his comfort zone.  I hear from devoted fans of the book (I've never read it) that the film is a huge disappointment in that it doesn't stay true and shifts many plot points to come across more conservative in lue of the time the film was made (so close to the 9/11 attacks).  I can semi-understand the reasoning there, but in the long run it feels like a copout.  That said, I'm not sure those details really would have saved the film from being a total bore.  Honestly, there is just nothing noteworthy here.  I fell asleep the first few times I tried to watch this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C7BWPATO40VA.html">A1C7BWPATO40VA</a><br/><p>I very regrettably asked my girlfriend to watch this movie with me.<br /><br />This movie consistently boggles the mind, but not in a good way.

No one was doing decontaminations here.<br />The brinkmanship here was classic and the Jack Ryan as good as ever.<br />Tom Clancy is a very good spy/ suspense writer, he just doesn't seem to know that much about atomic bombs.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGB4HN3QCGAL.html">A3DGB4HN3QCGAL</a><br/><p>The Hunt for Red October came the closest to being like one of Tom Clancy's novels, none of the others since have done as well. The Sum of All Fears is an example of this with the studio taking the title and some of the characters from the story and throwing away most of the plot.<br />I will say that I think maybe Ben Affleck, say what you will about him, is at least a little better cast than Harrison Ford was. He is at least more in line with being the correct age for the character Clancy wrote about (and I think Clancy approved of him as well). The movie is all right for light entertainment (?) but if you will read a 6 or 700 page book you should really spend your money there instead as all of the Clancy stories visually would work better as TV miniseries.</p></br><a href="../users/A28B7IJR80M8KE.html">A28B7IJR80M8KE</a><br/><p>This is the fourth movie based on the character of Jack Ryan,& Tom Clancy's popular book series, 1990's "Hunt for Red October" featured Alec Baldwin in the role, which was o.k., when he dropped out of the follow-ups, Harrison Ford took over, although 1992's "Patriot Games" brought out the best in Ford as Jack Ryan, 1994's "Clear & Present Danger" continued in consistentsy & was in all fairness a good follow-up to "Games", you could actually forgive them for Baldwin in "Red October", but now we have "The Sum of All Fears" which tells a good story & for the most part stays with the tension seen in the other films, since Ford decided not to do this one, the filmakers decided to go back in time so to speak & show Ryan as a rookie rather than a veteran as in the case of Ford, which is fine, Ben Affleck is very believeable as a younger version of Ford, not only in character but in appearance, & his girlfriend totally nails the character that Anne Archer created in Ford's films, who will later become his wife, even Morgan Freeman echoes the character played by James Earl Jones in the others as does Liev Scheiber as Clark played the same way by Willem DaFoe in "Clear & Present Danger", what ruins this one is the lack of consistentsy in events, it is as if the filmakers here have never seen the others, for starters, Ryan & Clark never meet until "Danger" but here they are sneaking around together, Freeman's character is that of Jones' character even though their name is different(another flaw) not to mention the fact that Freeman suffers a terrible fate which would make Jones non-existent in the others(another dumb move), Affeck totally embodies Ryan just as Ford did, & I have no problem with their prequel approach, but why not be consistent????, the only redemming thing this one has is the tense standoff between the U.S & Russia who become pawns in a deadly game of deceit by Ex-Nazis who want to see both countries kill each other in their quest for domination, which in a sense echoes the cold war, which plays in some ways on consistentsy with the other films whose time frame is consistent, where "Red October" more or less shows the end, & "Games" & "Danger" dealing with other matters of national security, if only Freeman who is very good here would have been on par with Jones' character & Ryan & Clark not meeting here, then consistentsy would have prevailed in this one, but standard Hollywood never thinks about the importance of consistentsy in follow-ups for whatever reasons probably being that they are more concerned about box-office, which in some ways insults the viewer who is a fan, the fact that this one didn't measure up in terms of box-office like its predecessors only re-inforces this fact, a good movie if you don't care about the others, but disappointing if you are looking for consistentsy!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>This film unfortunately was ultimately a big disappointment to me. I can forgo any complaints about the casting of the main character. The story is the culprit here. This is actually a very engrossing film until the final third. The film titillates the viewer tediously divulging events and characters constructing a complex framework of suspense, paranoia and intrigue that ultimately delivers a devastating situation to the world's two superpowers. It is amazing that the scriptwriter, the director or both did not know how to culminate all these events into a climax equal to the impressive filmmaking up to that point. Throughout this film the villains seemed to hold great power and influence and were in absolute control of events that they were manipulating. In the final third of the film the rug gets pulled out from under them and the rest of us. Even Jerry Goldsmith's score seemed to be somewhat reflective on the dubiousness of this entire project. To summarize I can only state that if you have seen the trailer, than you have seen the basic plot line and there is really nothing more you need to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>**1/2 "The Sum of All Fears" raises the question of just how appropriate it is to use a subject like global nuclear warfare as window dressing for what is, essentially, a pretty run-of-the-mill action/adventure melodrama.  No subject matter is, of course, off limits when it comes to filmmaking - and that includes nuclear annihilation - but one can at least demand that the context and the treatment it receives be commensurate with the gravity of that subject.  (One need only look back to 1983's "Testament" to see how this can indeed be done successfully).<p>Even putting aside the questionable nature of the material, "The Sum of All Fears" turns out to be a pretty weak action film overall, surprisingly lacking in tension and suspense despite the high stakes nature of its premise.  It's November 2002, and some higher-ups in the American government have discovered that a rogue nuclear missile is out there somewhere, most likely developed and planted by the quickly de-stabilizing Russian government.  Or was it?  Jack Ryan, that erstwhile hero of many of John Clancy's most popular novels, is the lone holdout who firmly believes that the bomb is NOT the work of the Russians but rather of some splinter terrorist group bent on setting off the device for their own nefarious purposes.<p>Ask not how Jack Ryan, in his current incarnation in the form of young Ben Affleck, has managed to shave a few decades off his age (we should all learn that secret).  What is amazing is that he seems to have regressed in stature as well.  In fact, for most of the film, Ryan seems like a wide-eyed schoolboy, completely incapable of holding his own with all the heavyweights in which he comes into contact.  Affleck, who managed to do some actual acting in the recent "Changing Lanes," is here reduced to a mere cipher, registering little more than openmouthed insipidity and rendering dull, emotionless line readings in the face of some pretty bland dialogue.  Despite the fact that he somehow manages to save the world (I thought Chris Rock did that just a few weeks ago in "Bad Company"), Ryan never establishes a core of gravitas that might make his character even slightly believable.  He is, in short, a mere bantamweight hero.<p>The first half of the film suffers greatly from the plodding direction of Phil Alden Robinson, whose style consists in having characters sit around in dark rooms talking to one another.  This is a particularly deadly technique when done in a wide screen format, since the effect of all those overblown close-ups coming one after another is to render the film strangely lumbering and static.  Things pick up a bit in the second half, but the filmmakers are forced to level an entire American city to accomplish it.  And even here, the pivotal scene in the film feels oddly truncated and aborted (one suspects that this depiction of urban destruction might have originally been longer and more elaborate but that sensitivity to the fears and emotions generated by the real life events of the past year may have encouraged the filmmakers to downplay it.  I know the trailer appeared more graphic).<p>When all is said and done, there just doesn't seem to be all that much urgency to anything that happens in "The Sum of All Fears," which is ludicrous considering the subject matter with which it is dealing.  This tone is particularly egregious in the final scene, a devil-may-care, happy-go-lucky conclusion that reminds us that Hollywood is never at a loss to find ways of demeaning even the most grave and sensitive of material.  In "The Sum of All Fears," even the possibility of the end of the world through mutually assured self-destruction turns out to be a yawner.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>The movie itself is not too bad and would probably be absolutely a great movie if you'd never read the book or any other novel by Tom Clancy.  I truly understand the need to slightly change the events in a novel to make a movie, but this was only a glimmer of the novel at best.  Ben Affleck being a good actor, he's still no Jack Ryan.  This also pretty much rewrites Debt of Honor and Executive Orders down the road if they're to be made into movies as well.  As stated above, a good movie, but definitely &quot;Sum of All Fear's&quot; in name only, not in substance.</p></br><a href="../users/A20ZFWGBY4REFX.html">A20ZFWGBY4REFX</a><br/><p>It's like this. Some or all of us have read the novels by Tom Clancy, or have seen the Clancy films such as "The Hunt for Red October", "Patriot Games", and "Clear and Present Danger". Well, "The Sum of All Fears" is no exception as you add this to that list! The direction of Phil Alden Robinson ("Sneakers", "Field of Dreams") was superb in every way possible! The performances of Ben Affleck ("Changing Lanes") and Morgan Freeman ("High Crimes") couldn't be better! The film talks about how one nuclear weapon comes up missing from a total of 27,000. It is up to CIA analyst Jack Ryan (Affleck) and CIA Director Bill Cabot (Freeman) to uncover the plot or else, it's World War III!! "The Sum of All Fears" also talks about how fear can escalate to paranoia in this world today due to the fact of wars and nuclear weapons. To me, Ben Affleck is the absolute best Jack Ryan since Harrison Ford in "Patriot Games" and "Clear and Present Danger", and Alec Baldwin in "The Hunt for Red October"! And when I watched "The Sum of All Fears", I would like to think of this as a prequel to the first 3 films because of Jack Ryan being a little young in this film. With two extraordinary actors, a great supporting cast including James Cromwell ("The General's Daughter"), Liev Schreiber ("Kate & Leopold"), and Bridget Moynahan ("Serendipity"), and lots of suspense that never lets up for a minute, "The Sum of All Fears" is 2-hour excitement at its best! A great DVD must-own to the first three films!</p></br><a href="../users/AMIOLJHCQHGBE.html">AMIOLJHCQHGBE</a><br/><p>...Start with Alec Baldwin as a young Jack Ryan, and Sean Connery as a Russian commander in `Hunt For Red October' in one of the greatest submarine movies since Das Boot! <p>Then you have Harrison Ford as Jack Ryan in `Patriot Games' in a tense drama about the IRA and terrorism (such a beautiful performance by the late Richard Harris as the IRA contact). And then `A Clear and Present Danger' with Jack Ryan uncovering government conspiracies that reach to the Presidential Office.<p>`Sum of All Fears' has Ben Affleck as the `new' Jack Ryan difusing a war scenario between Russia and the USA after a nuke is exploded in Baltimore.<p>All these films are seat-grippers in their own right, but I have to say the Harrison Ford films are the best. Like the Connery 007 flicks, they are top notch in cinematography and screenplay writing. Ford is the only Jack Ryan I will remember with detail. Affleck was better in `Daredevil' and `Pearl Harbor' (I believe Pearl Harbor will be the highpoint in his career especially after the horrible `Gigli'...)<p>This is a guys' set of flicks. You've seen them all on TBS (owns everthing now including `Field Of Dreams'...), BUT, this is a set of movies you want to watch one after the other with a pizza and a surround system.</p></br><a href="../users/A29IYGR7SNPRIV.html">A29IYGR7SNPRIV</a><br/><p>I love Morgan Freeman; he's one of the most gifted actors around today. That said, his presence alone can't save this movie. Ben Affleck looks as if he somehow wandered into the wrong production and isn't sure what to do about it. Aside from everything else, he lacks the gravitas that Harrison Ford brought to his roles in the Clancy films.<p>It's a manipulative effort that tries to play upon everyone's worst fear: that of nuclear war, but succeeds only in being silly. The climax relies upon computer communications that could never possibly happen; the plot is so thin you can see daylight through it. There are some decent special effects but even combining the few positive aspects there are do not make this worth seeing.<p>Don't waste your money. Go see The Bourne Identity instead; it, at least, is entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>It's not easy replacing Harrison Ford as a beloved screen hero, but Ben Affleck brings fresh vitality to The Sum of All Fears, reviving Paramount's Tom Clancy franchise in the role Ford made famous. As CIA agent Jack Ryan, Affleck is a rookie in the covert ranks, unraveling a plot that lures Russian and American superpowers into a nuclear standoff, while a neofascist faction turns most of Baltimore into an atomic wasteland and holds the world in the grip of a terrorist nightmare. Unfortuneately this film doesn't succeed at anything besides putting the viewer to sleep. There is very little character developement in this 2 hour long movie, and the A-BOMB sequence only lasts for about 5 seconds! Don't see this, it's not worth the money.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NX99GVAX4TRP.html">A2NX99GVAX4TRP</a><br/><p>Don't expect the Clancy book... don't even expect Clancy's plotting (they changed the bad guys, foolishly).  They also made Jack Ryan a rookie so Ben Affleck could portray him.  It doesn't fit in with the previous Baldwin/Ford films in the Ryan series.<br />It's a prequel in terms of the character, but a sequel in terms of being set in modern day.<p>Got that?<p>Let me start again.  As a cold-war gone hot kind of suspense thriller it will probably hold your interest.  It's a talky,<br />outsmart the politicians kind of a thing, mostly.  Morgan Freeman is charismatic and always a pleasure to watch.  Affleck is... well... probably about what you would expect.  He's not a bad actor, but he's not a particularly good one (at least here)either.  When you finally get to the big scene.. it's a let down and the film still has a half hour or so before it wraps up. During that last half-hour credibility really stretches.<p>Good for a rental, and Freeman's performance.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YHKSTVSYEYTU.html">A1YHKSTVSYEYTU</a><br/><p>The Sum of All Fears is the fourth film and in my opinion best film so far based on Tom Clancy's spy thrillers featuring the ever-reluctant hero Jack Ryan, now played by (a much more age appropriate) Ben Affleck.<p>The plot of this movie revolves around a neo-fascist group, led by a nasty Alan Bates, trying to provoke a nuclear war between Russia and America by exploding a nuclear device on American soil (Baltimore, to be precise). It stars Ben Affleck as a younger Ryan, pre-marriage and pre Hunt For Red October, being taken under the wing of fatherly CIA director Morgan Freeman. I know there have been some very mixed reviews for this movie but much to my pleasant surprise I really enjoyed this movie and found it to be totally gripping and an excellent edge of the seat thriller. <p>The Sum of all Fears is directed by Phil Alden Robinson, who previously directed the wonderful Field of Dreams, and he brings a lot more depth, subtlety and humour to both the characters and the plot development than Phillip Noyce previously managed in either of the last two Ryan movies (Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger), not to mention the other clunkers on Noyce's r&eacute;sum&eacute;, including The Saint, Sliver and The Bone Collector (excellent novel, terrible adaptation). In fact it's a wonder this franchise has survived Phillip Noyce and that Noyce still has a career (although apparently his latest movie Rabbit Proof fence is actually very good).  <p>As for the cast, I feel that Affleck is a perfect choice and that he has at last found a decent role in a decent movie. Perhaps his first decent role since Good Will Hunting, which he co-wrote with Matt Damon, and certainly much much better than the dreadful Titanic-alike Pearl Harbour. Morgan Freeman is of course reliably excellent as always and has some of the best lines in the whole movie as CIA boss Bill Cabot but there are also other excellent supporting performances from the likes of Liev Schrieber as a covert CIA operative, James Cromwell (as a belligerent U.S. President), Ciar&aacute;n Hinds as Russian President Nemerov and Alan Bates as the chief villain. However I can't say I was totally convinced with Bridget Moynahan as Ryan's girlfriend, Dr Cathy Mueller. Although one thing's for sure, she is very pleasant to look at and there were some excellent shared scenes between her and Affleck. I just didn't find her very convincing in her white coat playing a surgeon.<p>In summary, I cannot think of a mainstream Hollywood thriller that I've enjoyed so much in a long time and many of the people I know that have also seen this film were equally as thrilled. I can honestly say that it was a pleasant surprise to enjoy this so much and that this is definitely one of the best films I've seen all year. Highly recommended! Four and a half stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>In easily the most horrible Clancy adaptation ever, The Sum of All Fears produces not only a nuclear blast on U.S. soil, but something just as damaging: overwhelming political correctness.  The screenwriter for this film changed the villains from Islamic terrorists (something current) to a rogue neo-Nazi group (something anachronistic), and it is a completely flagrant, transparent, sanitized placation of the PC crowd.<br /><br />Essentially the plot involves neo-Nazis detonating a mid-football game nuke in Baltimore to goad the United States into a nuclear war with a failing Russian government.  Yeah, because there will be a lot of land and nothing but good times after the U.S. and Russia go all Jackson Pollock with nukes across the world.  Pretty stupid, huh?  Well, the problems after that are numerous.<br /><br />First, after dropping a nuke nobody would stick around to see their handiwork.  This is not a suicide-bomber or serial killer.  Second, could someone explain to the cast and crew what an EMP actually does?  If a massive one hits downtown Baltimore, there will not be operational handheld electronics or helicopter radios, and they certainly shouldn't be used to advance the storyline.  Speaking of the helicopter, if one gets rocked out of the sky by the concussive force of a mushroom cloud, I doubt someone is walking away, much less saving the day like Ryan.  Finally, why is Ryan still in the Baltimore/D.C. area shortly after the explosion?  Why does the movie end with him kicking his feet up in relaxation as if there isn't fallout?  It'd been more believable if he had a third eye on his forehead or looked like visitor to the bar from Total Recall.<br /><br />It is obvious Ben Affleck is not Jack Ryan.  Sure, he's playing a former military officer with a law degree who is employed by the CIA as a foreign affairs analyst, but he's way too young (in his late 20s when filmed) for this role.  He's neither Alec Baldwin nor Harrison Ford, two actors who actually look as if they could be Jack Ryan.  The best he could possibly hope for is to be a younger version; a mouth-breathing, late-20 something, semi-serious entry level employee who would be more comfortable at a Frat house than a political environment.  He's as miscast as Denise Richards would be playing a nuclear physicist.  (Oops!)  Come to think of it, why WASN'T she cast for that role in this movie?  It would have been just as believable.<br /><br />Aside from Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Bill Cabot (Director of the CIA), there wasn't much I enjoyed other than a fun scene in which Ryan misses a date with his fianc&eacute; and tells her that his boss (i.e. Cabot) needs him to board a plane to Russia instead.  Most of the time spent watching this movie involved me looking down at my watch, which is sad considering the realistic nature of the topic and source material.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>This film could have been a good one. It came out after 9/11 but before Iraq, at the time of Afghanistan. It is about the "final" confrontation between the USA and Russia. A nuclear terrorist attack is organized in Baltimore so that the USA may believe it comes from the Russians and may start the procedure leading to a full out nuclear war. From the very start the theory that is illustrated here is that terror in the world is organized by the Israeli secret services with the help of some western autonomous adventurers and with the complicity of the hard liners in the Russian and Ukrainian armies. Then the whole story is difficult to believe because of the total lack of real believable hard facts. The American president appears as quite manipulated by his own military personnel and his State and Defense Secretaries, without speaking of the CIA. The Russian president appears just as much manipulated but with maybe a little bit more nerve. The whole plot fails because a small CIA intellectual agent manages to speak to the Russian president directly via the red telephone and make him take the decision to halt his alert, a decision that the US president immediately imitates. How can we believe that. The Weapons of Mass Destruction are quoted  in some remote small sentence somewhere unimportant but the propaganda is clear. The various actors of this plot are then eliminated one after the other in the most radical way possible. That's a shame in a way because the film is rather well made and acted but it is obvious war propaganda that supports the theory pretending the world is being manipulated if not controlled by the Israelis, a resurgence of sorts of the old hitlerian anti-semitism of old. I guess some believe that good old hate-theories can always be revived in a way or another, with a little bit of upgrading if necessary.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>Nobody writes military thrillers like Tom Clancy.  A handful of the movies made from his novels are worthy of the original manuscript. "Hunt for Red October" is my key example.<br /><br />If I had to sum up the problems for "The Sum of All Fears", I'd first mention acting.  I really like Ben Affleck, but he simply doesn't define the role like either Alec Baldwin or Harrison Ford.  Perhaps if he were cast in an earlier portion of Jack Ryan's life, he might have worked, but Affleck simply lacks the authority and competence inherent in Ford's manner--and being a MUCH younger man following Ford just seems out of sync.<br /><br />This was also one of the rare roles where I saw Morgan Freeman as Morgan Freeman.  Usually, he transports me to the place and time he's inhabiting in the character--not in this film.<br /><br />The plot is interesting--but nowhere near as well done as the book.  Just read the book.  It's available here on Amazon and well worth the price.</p></br><a href="../users/A36NUDST4Y5JBA.html">A36NUDST4Y5JBA</a><br/><p>This is a good movie that invites one to think.

Strange?  Only when judging the film with the novel and the author's entire body of work involving Jack Ryan.  Having not read the novel, this obvious discrepancy did not play a part in my judgement of the film or its performances.<br />On the whole, the film is good; the premise believable, all the more chilling in the wake of 9-11.  Affleck is on the brink of being 'discovered' by the CIA higher-ups; his paper on the new Russian president moves him into an inner circle of quick decision-making presidential advisers headed by the wonderful Morgan Freeman.  Not knowing the protocol, Ryan speaks when he is not spoken to, is judged green, shut down by the brass and goes through many agonizing moments of frustration when he is not even given the chance to express his theories.<br />In the end, he is proven correct, but not before monumentally catastrophic disaster strikes in scenes all too reminiscient of 9-11.<br />Affleck is amicable enough as Ryan; I would have liked to see how Harrison Ford's more mature Ryan would have changed the plot and the interchange with other characters.  Of course, Morgan Freeman is fantastic (as he always is) in his role as senior advisor.<br />Recommended to all who like a fast-paced thriller that all works out well in the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A2L7WYA5OENV03.html">A2L7WYA5OENV03</a><br/><p>I knew it was a special film right from the opening credits' beautiful music. Great recreation of how CIA's upper management will call in favors from retired individuals off the record.  Ben Affleck did surprisingly well, just don't try to create a logical timeline of all the Clancy films.  I think the Jack Ryan CIA analyst character is just an archetype, because in each film it's the first time he's ever had to go "operational".  Though a lot of critics have thought it didn't realistically deal with the topic of radiation, it was actually fine.  Those are the same Hollywood critics who think Independence Day's obsession with nuclear winter was warranted.  And yes, the Russians are fully capable of attacking a US carrier using their low-level flight techniques.  I particularly enjoyed the sight of anti-missile artillery automatically knocking down a couple of those anti-ship missiles. The running out of the stadium, detonation, and subsequent scenes of the US Marines retrieving the president were breathtaking.  This film's a serious contender for Best of the Genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A331OF34UX4Y1K.html">A331OF34UX4Y1K</a><br/><p>Affleck is simply one of the worst actors of his generation.

Naturally, the audience assumed that this was a movie that had an atomic bomb as the dramatic center, and that the film would focus on the results of that detonation.  Instead, what director Phil Robinson presented was a carefully crafted movie that asks the viewer to forget a few things while watching.  Robinson uses the unexpectedly fine acting of Ben Affleck, who plays a very junior CIA agent Jack Ryan, to divert the audience's attention from both some hugely noticeable plot gaffes and variations from Tom Clancy's novel. Clancy originally pictured the terrorists as Moslem extremists, and in the pre 9/11 political correctness, Robinson did not wish to alienate our many Moslem friends worldwide by suggesting that any of them could wish harm to America. Instead, he switches the villains to neo-Nazis, since even PC supporters do not hold them in high regard.  As one of these German terrorists was expounding his beliefs for the camera, he spoke in the same Teutonic cadences that used to characterize Erich von Stroheim back in the 40s.  All that this German failed to do was to stroke his mustache a la Snidely Whiplash.  Further, Robinson avoids the consequences of the logic reached by the Nazi terrorists, who believe that when they cause America and Russia to destroy one another in nuclear war, a resurgent regime of national socialism will take root in Germany to control what is left of the world.  Unfortunately, neither director Robinson nor these Nazi wannabes have remembered that the thousands of nuclear devices that will surely be used in any massive exchange of weapons of mass destruction must surely prove as harmful to the world at large as it would to the two combatants.  Yet it is to Affleck's credit that his youthful earnestness and good looks that he can divert attention from those shortcomings to a more conventional thriller in which a ticking clock is the antagonist.  The explosion itself lasts but a few seconds nor does the film focus on its after effects.  What the movie does accomplish is to get the viewer involved in the improbable trail of clues that leads Affleck to the terrorists who have convinced the presidents of both the United States and Russia that each is plotting the destruction of the other.  The movie shows the inner workings of advisors of both countries.  It is not surprising that the American and Russian military leaders are far more alike in a sense of misplaced macho than they are in anything else.  Both the American president and his Russian counterpart see an escalating series of confrontations as no more than a game of chicken played out on an international stage, with each daring the other to knock off a chip from their shoulders. By the close of the credits, the audience is left with the uncomfortable feeling that if all that stands between mutually assured nuclear annihilation and world continuity is the grit of such youngsters as Jack Ryan, then the inner message of the film becomes clear enough: if world leaders have to choose between fear and calculation as the basis for planning escalated responses to external aggression, then both leaders had better develop a healthy sense of fear of the consequences that cool calculation might otherwise entail.</p></br><a href="../users/ADKA2MJQQCMTO.html">ADKA2MJQQCMTO</a><br/><p>If you HAD however, this movie should, by all rights drive you crazy.  <p>Let me start by saying that if you're new to the Jack Ryan character and have never seen 'Patriot Games' or 'Clear and Present Danger' or 'The Hunt for Red October', then You'll probably really like this movie.  The preformances are all solid, the characters are intresting, the plot moves well, and the action scenes are a lot of fun.<p>If you HAD seen any of these movies though, you'll notice that the time-line for the four movies is REALLY messed up.  This is supposed to be the FIRST Jack Ryan movie, it's pointed out that he just started in the CIA.  Why then is this movie CLEARLY set in 2002?  Shouldn't it have been set back in the early to mid eighties?<p>I was floored that NOBODY making the movie seened to catch this REALLY OBVIOUS flaw in their characters story bible.  It drove me crazy through the whole movie.<p>So again, if you've never seen a Tom Clancy movie, you'll probably enjoy this movie a great deal.  If you had , however, you'll probably be a little on the disappointed side.</p></br><a href="../users/A8M4WE1MT4R4O.html">A8M4WE1MT4R4O</a><br/><p>A major dissapointment.  Because of all the terrorist action lately, I was intrigued to the point of obsession to see this movie.  When I finally viewed it, I felt cheated.  Not only was "Sum of All Fears" boring, it was also completely lacking of sincerity and depth.  After the bombing of the sports arena and the surrounding areas of Baltimore, the movie seemed to disregard the monumental tragedy, and trivialize it.  Of course the President's life was spared while all others had to perish.  Nothing was mentioned on any news footage about the attack, nor did they show the devasting effects of a bomb leveling a major stadium and how it destroyed an entire city, because the movie was too busy making Ben Affleck sooperhero!....to the rescue!!!!! Woohoo!.......I thought "The Sum Of All Fears" was going to be more of a commentary on terrorism and how this kind of tradegy would affect our community and culture, but it turned out to be an action vehicle for Ben Affleck.  And by the way, his girlfriend nurse at the hospital would have died in real life, they even showed her being blown away in one scene, but somehow, he meets up with her later, and she has a little scratch on her head....yeah right!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2.html">A3N8RZSXKN1OR2</a><br/><p>I have to admit I haven't gotten around to reading the original book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425184226">The Sum of All Fears</a> on which this movie is based, but a quick skim of other reviews suggests that the script doesn't follow it very closely.  Some time in the very near future, CIA analyst and historian Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) finds himself caught up in a plot by European Neo-Nazis to set the U.S. and post-Communist Russia against each other so that they can, presumably, sweep up whatever pieces are left (which strikes me as not the smartest plan going).  As in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305182043">The Hunt for Red October</a>, Ryan finds that many people in positions of power aren't prepared to listen to what he has to say, and only by a bold stroke is he able to carry out his self-appointed mission of stopping the missiles from flying.<br /><br />Of course, like all Tom Clancy movies, the story is far too complicated to summarize in the space I'm given here.  And I have to give it points for all-too-probable scariness: in a world where building a small, dirty atomic bomb is almost within the reach of a high-school physics student, to say nothing of disaffected political groups with agendas of their own, what happens on celluloid could well happen for real some day.  What bothers me most about it is that, apart from its similarities to "Red October," it seems to be out of chronological order.  The original book was published in 1991, seven years after "RO."  Affleck's Ryan is not only clearly much younger than Harrison Ford's (and even considerably younger than Alec Baldwin's), he isn't even married yet (he's dating a second-year medical resident who doesn't have a clue about what he really does for a living)--now surely it wouldn't have been difficult to establish him as a family man, and it might even have added to the suspense.  Would it have been all that improbable, given that most Americans in positions of power today still remember all too keenly the days when "Russia" was the bugaboo of our nightmares (think Cuban Missile Crisis), for Ryan to have met with obstructionism from them, even after his success with Marko Ramius?  And for some reason Affleck himself just doesn't engage my sympathies as Ford and Baldwin did.  It's not a bad movie, but it's unlikely to become one of my favorites.</p></br><a href="../users/A33TBHM3O9AY17.html">A33TBHM3O9AY17</a><br/><p>I finally got around to watching this one over the weekend, and although I enjoyed it immensely, I have to give it a mixed review.  Now admittedly, I haven't read the book yet -- it's been sitting on my shelf waiting for me to get to it for far too long -- so I'll do my mea culpa right now if the answers to my concerns are already duly explained.<br /><br />The most glaring issue for me was, where does this movie fit chronologically with the other Jack Ryan films?  It starts with a background scene from the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, and then jumps to "29 years later", which means the main story would be set in 2002.  However, instead of the "married with children" Jack Ryan that we saw in "Patriot Games" and "Clear and Present Danger", we find a young, single Jack Ryan (played by Ben Affleck) who is still essentially an unknown nobody at the CIA.  We also get introduced to a similarly youthful Jack Clark, of "Rainbow Six" fame.  I'm not sure if these anachronistic gymnastics were intentional or not, but I found it more than a bit distracting as I watched this film.  To borrow a phrase from Kelly Bundy, the whole thing "wobbles the mind."<br /><br />Aside from that, though, it was a typical Tom Clancy technothriller, chock full of high suspense from start to finish.  This one resurrects the spectre of nuclear warfare between the U.S. and post-Soviet Russia after a neo-Fascist terror cell unleases a low-yield nuke in Baltimore, then sets about to make it look like it was a Russian attack.  As predicted, the U.S. response only serves to up the ante until the two nations stand teetering at the brink of mutual annihilation.<br /><br />In the meantime, the young Jack Ryan follows his uncanny instincts to unravel the puzzle in a fast-paced, action-filled plot line that never eases up the tension.  The special effects for the nuclear blast are very well done indeed.  However, the sight of Ryan traipsing around near ground zero apparently without any harmful side effects from the radiation is just a teensy oversight in the realism department.<br /><br />Overall I cannot say I was at all disappointed by these above lapses, just puzzled.  The story itself was, as are all the Clancy films, gripping and suspenseful.  Definitely a good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. Morgan Freeman is always good, and Ben Affleck does a nice job as the young CIA analyst. The two picks for the American and Russian president are right-on--Ciaran Hinds as the Russian president is really excellent, as is James Cromwell as his American counterpart. And the guy who plays the CIA operative is good, too (unfortunately I don't know the actor's name). But anyway, he's a pretty cool cat in this movie, and just what you'd expect of an experienced field agent.<p>Also, the scene in which Affleck tells his fiance that he can't make their date because Morgan Freeman, the head of the CIA, wanted Affleck to jump on a plane to Russia with him is nicely done. It's short but provides perhaps the only moment of comic relief in the entire movie.<p>The scene where the fission bomb goes off has some realistic looking effects, too. Overall, I'd say this is a pretty good movie. Big Steve says go see it and don't Bogart the popcorn.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>The producers of this film decided to change the villains from Islamic extremists to neo-nazis (after all, Nazis don't have a lobby--everyone hates them).  The producers have to be hating life post-911 since in my opinion at least this greatly detracted from the relevance of the film.  Serves them right for listening to Political Correctness rather than reality.<p>The movie is based, of course, on Tom Clancy's novel "The Sum of All Fears" and deals with the detonation by terrorists of an atomic bomb on American soil. To that extent, the movie follows the novel.  But the movie alters the villains ..., and apparently decided to cast the hero, Jack Ryan, as a much younger man evidently to enable Ben Affleck to play the part.  Afleck is OK as Jack Ryan, but only OK.  Morgan Freeman does his customary great job in the role as the CIA director, and his mentoring of Ryan is my favorite part of the movie. The chemistry between Freeman and Affleck is good, which helps to make up for, well, Affleck. The rest of the cast turns in pretty decent performances.<p>Since in the movie Ryan is a junior analyst rather than Deputy CIA Director (to enable Affleck to play Ryan) the part where Ryan prevents world war 3 is less plausible.  Readers of the book will know what I mean--spoiler omitted here.<p>Overall, the movie moves along pretty well, and tells a complicated story about as coherently as possible in the movie medium.  There is plenty of drama and action.  The special effects are good.  <p>This is not a great movie, but it is a good one.  The DVD audio and video are very good.</p></br><a href="../users/AUDSM2CTLLW1Q.html">AUDSM2CTLLW1Q</a><br/><p>There is a scene early in "The Sum of All Fears" where Morgan Freeman's character, Bill Cabot (deputy CIA director), tells Ben Affleck's Jack Ryan (now, a young CIA turk) to "pay attention, because you are about to breath air that's way over your pay grade".  Freeman could very well have been speaking to Affleck in a real-life conversation in reference to acting.  Freeman's mere presence runs circles around Affleck's attempts to act.  Unfortunately, that is one negatives that prevents "Sum..." from being more of a landmark movie.  I struggled with the decision over whether to give this movie 3 or 4 star.  In the end, the acting deficiencies by some of main characters and some of the too-convenient plot devices, caused me to settle on 3 stars.<p>While Affleck's acting left something to be desired, I can't be totally critical of his performance.  He really did try.  He put forth as workman-like an effort as anyone could hope for.  He just simply does not have the talent or presence to fill the formidable shoes of an action hero like Jack Ryan.  Action hero roles are proving to be a difficult type of acting.  Add to that the premise of this movie, a nuclear attack on Baltimore followed by mounting tensions between the U.S. and Russia in its aftermath, and you have a tall order for any actor to fill.  The true acting disaster in this movie belongs to Bridget Moynahan who plays his girl friend (soon-to-be wife) Cathy Muller.  Moynahan's most notable previous work was as one of the dancing waitresses in "Coyote Ugly", not exactly a stellar pedigree.  Maybe in time she will improve as an actress, but in "Sum of All Fears", Moynahan shows absolutely no acting or emotional range.  Baltimore is in ruins, her boyfriend is off risking his life to prevent a full-scale nuclear war, she has to deal with nuclear victims at her hospital and her expression would make one think she was annoyed at missing a sale at Macy's, not that she has just witnessed one of the greatest tragedies visited upon U.S. soil.<p>Having said my piece about two the main leads, let me focus now on the rest of the movie.  The plot for "Sum of All Fears" is a very sobering one (and one that several real-life experts find to be very plausible).  With the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise to nuclear power status of many Middle East nations, it's not inconceivable that a terrorist cell could get their hands on a single nuclear weapon and transport it to the United States.  In this movie, an Israeli jet equipped with a nuclear bomb is shot down during a skirmish between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors in 1973.  Fast forward a few decades and the bomb has been unearthed by some scavengers who are unaware of its true purpose.  A group of Nazi-loyalists track down the rogue bomb and procure it for their purposes.  The purposes being destroying a major U.S. city and making it appear that Russia was behind it in order to start a full scale nuclear war between to the two nations.  In the aftermath, the Nazi's plan to use the chaos to reclaim worldwide power (at least that seems to be the plan.  It's not extraordinarily clear).  The concept of a nuclear terrorist attack is a very scary, very real scenario that hits home even harder in the aftermath of 9/11 and the discovering of an Al-Qaeda member planning to set off a radioactive 'dirty bomb'.  This situation is handled with appropriate degrees of plausibility.  The suddenness of the nuclear detonation in Baltimore combined its signature shockwaves and mushroom cloud are visions that are horrifying to view makes one hope to never have to in real life.  The reactions by the President (played ably by James Cromwell) and the rest of his cabinet seem very real and very human.  They aren't ice-cold, calm, and calculating in determining how to respond to this devastation.  They react emotionally, confused, and frustrated.  It is how one would expect leaders to react behind closed doors during such a tremendous crisis.  One would think President Bush and his advisors had moments similar to those in the movie in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.  The rising tension as one incident after another pushes the U.S. and Russia closer to nuclear war is palpable.  It's frightening to see how, for the right money and opportunity, such plans can come to fruition.<p>"Sum of All Fears" is a well-done movie and will leave the audience captivated as they watch the progression of events.  There is just a feeling, though, that this movie could have been something more with different casting choices.</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>Oh, dear! What was Ben Affleck thinking when he signed on to star in the functional equivalent of  `Young Indiana Jones' to a role that has Harrison Ford's hefty paw-prints all over it? Even if the film were a faithful recreation of Tom Clancy's superb and thought-provoking thriller about what happens when an Arab extremist group gains possession of an Israeli nuclear weapon lost during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, which it is not, the ploy of giving Jack Ryan the time machine treatment is hokey at best, and ruinous at worst. Luckily, the script is so hackneyed and implausible at parts that it was downright silly. <p>For example, Ryan is taking a helicopter ride when an atomic detonation occurs. The several kiloton blast knocks the chopper out of the sky, but Ryan survives. Right. The blast would have melted the chopper as it knocked it from the sky with a heat blast so intense nothing could have possibly survived.  But Hollywood can't kill off the Ryan franchise by pulling a Terminator-like turn and sending Ryan back into the past to get killed since that would prevent our boy Ben wouldn't mature into becoming Alex Baldwin, who then proceeds to save the free world in "The Hunt For Red October", set later in Ryan's career.  Got it? Me neither.  <p>Having said all that, had the main character's name not been Jack Ryan, and had I not already read the book and therefore arrived predisposed as to what it was that I was going to see dramatized, the film is not all that bad. As a techno-thriller, it is exciting, well photographed, and has a decent cast, including a charming Morgan Freeman (does this guy never take a vacation?) as Jack's Director of Counter Intelligence (DCI) connection. Lee Garlington is fetching and attractive as Jack's main squeeze, and Live Schreiber is particularly good as a young John Clark, a figure prominent in some of the later Clancy novels. The film is facts paced, has some interesting action sequences, and as an evening's entertainment is worth the watching. It is hardly in the caliber of films such as "The Hunt For Red October", "Patriot Games", or "Clear And Present Danger", but maybe Ben can try again when his paws grow a little with age. Ford is getting a little long in the tooth to be playing Ryan. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3JXOXKWOIETIY.html">A3JXOXKWOIETIY</a><br/><p>This film is based on the Tom Clancy novel, is a big budget blockbuster, and is pretty much worthless.  The plot itself has some major flaws, but the main qualm one has is though the actors and scriptwriters are paid millions here, the high budget ironically cheapens the film.  The actors speak their lines very quickly and very loudly, Ben Affleck is one of those everyman megastars, but with no real talent to warrant the stardom.<p>  Morgan Freeman, a great actor, has made some real junk lately from "Deep Impact" to this one.  And Pragna Desai is obviously more intelligent than the lines she is given: "Yawn...double yawn".  Liev Schreiber was good as usual as a CIA operative.<p>  But the most laughable aspect is certain parts of the plot.  Okay I'll accept that Israel was dumb enough to let a nuclear bomb get lost in the desert.  I'll accept that some Arabs found it and sold it.  What I won't accept is that Russian scientists would help Neonazis make the bomb operational, or even the "reasoning" of the Nazis.  Namely to get the Russians and the Americans to fight each other as "times have changed".  Really?<br />So the Cold War didn't really happen?  And the one Nazi with qualms tells the others he is out(what does he think will happen?)<p>  But most incredible of all is the top advisor tells the President, "If they did this to make a point to stay out of Chechnya..."  Yes, you heard that right.  I mean I know in real life Presidencial advisors are dumb, but Russia nukes us to say stay out of Chechnya??!!  So the President authorizes full scale nuclear war based on hearsay.  God help us if we ever get a "Dead Zone" President such as that.<p>  I understand you have to suspend your disbelief for this stuff, but it should have some semblance of reality.  <p>  Even the special effects are disappointing, as the blast is shown for about one minute, and most of it is a helicopter crashing in slow motion and an obviously fake mushroom cloud.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>...<p>Ben Affleck has taken over the role of Jack Ryan, played in previous movies by Harrison Ford. Affleck is competent enough to make us forget that Ryan is suddenly thirty years younger and at the start of his career. <p>The story, at times convoluted and confusing, revolves around an atomic bomb lost in the Golan Heights in 1973 by the Israelis in one of their endless wars with the Arab world. Decades later it is unearthed by a peasant who, thinking it is a piece of junk, peddles it to an arms dealer. The dealer then sells it to a group of neo-Nazis who plan to use it to provoke a war between the United States and Russia. American officials, already suspicious of Russia's recent behavior, believe they have all the proof they need after the attack occurs. Only Ryan thinks otherwise, and it is up to him to prevent World War III. <p>The technical aspects of "The Sum of all Fears" are uniformly first-rate. The cast, which includes Morgan Freeman and Alan Bates, as well as the marvelous character actors James Cromwell and Philip Baker Hall, works hard at making their characters credible. In the end, though, they are undone by some weak scriptwriting and absurd plot twists.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Maybe I'm too easy to please, but I found The Sum of All Fears to be one powerful humdinger of a motion picture.  I should point out that I came into this film with no preconceptions; I have not read any of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan novels, nor have I seen any of the earlier movies starring Harrison Ford in the central role.  I can certainly see how major and strange a transition it must be for fans to go from the older Ford to the young Affleck, and the obvious disparity between the film and the book that inspired it would also probably bother me had I previously read Clancy's 1991 novel.  I was attracted to this movie for two reasons: one is the plot.  Delaying the release of this film in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attack was the right thing to do, given the subject matter dealt with here, but it also served to pique my interests in the film.  As an old and unrepentant Cold Warrior now viewing the world through eyes permanently rimmed red by the reprehensible actions of cowardly terrorists, the idea of an American-Russian nuclear war brought about by the maneuvering of terrorists definitely spoke to me.  The other aspect of the film that appealed to me was the prominent role played by Morgan Freeman.  I've said it before, and I'm sure I'll say it again: in my opinion, Morgan Freeman is the greatest actor working today.<p>The complex yet tightly-wound plot of this film is impressive.  The sudden death of a Soviet (now Russian) leader still carries with it a significant amount of trepidation in the West, but this film takes such fears to an unprecedented level.  The characterization of Russian President Nemerov is, I think, the most crucial element of this entire plot, and it comes off magnificently.  Talk about being boxed in against a wall.  Try being a new Russian leader already regarded as a hard-liner by basically everyone in the West (except for CIA analyst Jack Ryan) and then have forces that should be under your control but are not attack Grozny, Chechnya, with horrible chemical weapons.  No Russian President can admit less than total control of his military.  Then have a nuclear bomb go off in a major American city, a tragedy made to look rather convincingly as an act of Russian aggression.  Americans are going to respond to such an attack with extreme prejudice.  Thus, before you have your new Presidential chair adequately adjusted for your comfort, you're on the brink of nuclear war.  Ciaran Hinds deserves all the credit I can give him for his convincing performance as President Nemerov; he (not Affleck, and not even Freeman) makes this motion picture the overwhelming success I think it is.  <p>The entire cast of this film is excellent (even Affleck), and so is the production value of everything you see.  The special effects are impressive (and it was a treat to see just how they were brought to life in the DVD special features dealing with the visual effects), but these are just the trimmings on the real feast.  The meat of The Sum of All Fears is a plot which is compelling, believable, disquieting, and, in the end, rather moving.  This movie drew me in completely to its world of intelligence, espionage, deception, politics, and diplomacy, and I could not possibly give it less than five stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XVRCU5DQBULH.html">A2XVRCU5DQBULH</a><br/><p>This fourth installment of the Jack Ryan series is a departure from the previous three and serves as a prequel to the others. Actually, it's more like an alternate timeline, since "The Hunt for Red October" takes place in the late 80s and this one takes place in 2002. But no matter. This film is deliciously good with all the propor Clancy elements in tact. Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) is an up-and-coming CIA analyst who stumbles on a plot to nuke Baltimore all too late. Morgan Freeman plays Cabot, Ryan's mentor and friend. The film never loses itself with technical jargon, something the Clancy novel does. Instead, it gives a good story about characters, governments, and mayhem on the verge of World War III. "The Sum of All Fears" is a fun movie for the military buff or Clancy fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C27IQUH9N1Z.html">A2C27IQUH9N1Z</a><br/><p>Yikes, I'm really surprised at the negative reviews here.  I haven't read the Clancy books so I had no preconceived notions, but I have enjoyed the earlier Jack Ryan films with Harrison Ford, and I HAVE seen many supposed thrillers lately that were extremely disappointing.  This is the first thriller I've enjoyed in a long time.  I thought the script was very good, the acting from top to bottom was superb, and the editing kept the many plot threads clear.<p>After Harrison Ford dropped out of this project and Ben Affleck expressed an interest in playing the lead, the script was revamped to show Jack Ryan at the beginning of his career.  In that capacity, as an intelligent neophyte, he meets his CIA mentor (Morgan Freeman), first ventures out with a seasoned field operative (Liev Schreiber), begins courting his future wife (Bridget Moynahan), advises the president (James Cromwell) for the first time, and meets the Russian president (Ciaran Hinds).  This is a very interesting time in the career of a beloved character, and the writers got it right and Affleck does a very good job here.  The villains are played by Alan Bates and Colm Feore.  What a fabulous cast!<p>Special features include two commentary tracks - one with the director and cinematographer and one with the director and author; meaty featurettes about the casting, production and special effects; a trailer; an on-the-set featurette.  The film can be heard in English or French, and subtitles are available only in English.<p>If you like exciting techno-thrillers and are not a Tom Clancy or Harrison Ford purist, give this film a chance.  It's terrific, and I hope they'll make more.  I'm not sure why some people didn't like it but I respectfully, and heartily, disagree with them.</p></br><a href="../users/AATKF0HDBQL86.html">AATKF0HDBQL86</a><br/><p>I've long been a fan of Tom Clancy's novels, and when The Sum of All Fears came out as a movie, I had to go see it because I hadn't seen a Jack Ryan film in a long time (I'd watched The Hunt for Red October once in the theater and numerous times on video, but Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger were just plain boring).  Let me tell you, from the first minute I was HOOKED!  The Sum of All Fears had everything that the last two movies lacked--a good potboiler of a plot, lots of action, and an awesome new Jack Ryan in Ben Affleck, who made the character very believable and human.<p>This movie had a great cast of supporting actors as well.  I loved seeing Morgan Freeman as Bill Cabot, Ryan's boss at the CIA, and James Cromwell as the President.  Liev Schreiber as Clark was terrific--he has matured quite nicely as an actor since playing Cotton Weary in the Scream trilogy.  Bridget Moynahan did a nice job as Cathy Muller, Ryan's girlfriend, and it was nice to see actor Michael Byrne as Grushkov.<p>One of the things that I really like about the DVD release of The Sum of All Fears is the fact that instead of releasing a &quot;bare bones&quot; version (in other words, no extras) like they usually do, Paramount went all out and included stuff that provides a fascinating look into the making of the film as well as the thoughts of those involved with it.  There are 2 tracks of commentaries--one with director Phil Alden Robinson and the cinematographer, and one with Robinson and Tom Clancy, as well as a 2-part making of documentary that goes into some of the reasons they decided to restart the franchise and cast a younger actor in the role of Jack Ryan (for those of you out there who didn't like Ben Affleck as Ryan, blame Sherry Lansing, CEO of Paramount's movie division--it was her idea to cast him) and a visual effects section with commentary on how they filmed some of the scenes.  There is also a theatrical trailer.  While the extras aren't as abundant as on other DVDs, this is a nice surprise from a studio that is normally loath to put extras on their DVDs at all because of the cost of including them (as a matter of fact, Paramount usually won't include extras unless the director insists on it).<p>IMO, The Sum of All Fears is a great film, and a nice way to revitalize the Jack Ryan franchise.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SRZQU1SZG4RR.html">A2SRZQU1SZG4RR</a><br/><p>The film begins with gripping scenes and haunting music ... Fighter jets landing, powerful spiritual music that is sad and almost like a funeral - setting the tone for what is to come. Ben Affleck plays the CIA agent Jack Ryan to perfection. There is great casting for all the major roles and key characters in the book. Although in the book, the city of Denver is the location used by terrorists for the attack, the choice of Baltimore, Maryland makes sense, since there is a port which clearly can be the point of entry for contraband. The fact is the film remains true to the intentions and spirit of Tom Clancy's book. There is political maneuvering, espionage, edge-of-your seat gripping moments after the attack and a very well executed plot. Suspense builds and the story unfolds ... The topic is fascinating and timely. It is almost like the "007" films of old ... You more or less know what to expect, but the ride is so engaging, you are caught up in the drama and events.<br /><br />A nuclear bomb is discovered in the desert by a bedouin, left buried from a downed airplane during the '73 Israeli War. He suspects it has some value and can make money by selling it. An agent purchases it for a mere pittance, vastly less than its true worth ... so realistic. After the unexpected death of the Russian President, his replacement is investigated by the CIA. The US President, his advisors and the CIA are busy extracting information about this relative "dark horse" to discover his stand on the major issues. In the past, Jack Ryan had written a paper on him, extrapolating his views on world events ... He accompanies a delegation from the US to visit Russia and ensure nuclear disarmament is going according to plans. Each side assesses the opposition with wary reminders of the past ever in the forefront of their minds ... How difficult it was to learn about Soviet arms during the cold war, US agents had died trying to access .information ... now a delegation was freely being shown the labs, nuclear reactor and storage facilties. Times had indeed changed ...<br /><br />The US President attends a filled to capacity football stadium in Baltimore, MD when suddenly, unexpectedly and rapidly Secret Agents usher him out ... A huge explosion occurs, with the mushroom  cloud indicating  a nuclear bomb went off. During the disaster, Jack Ryan seeks his superior, only to find him taking his last breath. He pays his last respects and uses his cell phone and ID bage to enter the White House. Jack had discovered irrefutable evidence that proves it was *not* a Russian attack. The nuclear substance originated in the United States. The fingerprints of the explosion and subsequent fall out are positive proof. However, suspense builds as the US President and Russian President are on stand-by preparing for war ... trying to read each others motives for action. The unraveling of the peace accords takes minutes although it took years and years to create peace and disarmament. The difficult decisions faced by the US President are depicted superbly ... The raw emotions arising during such a national disaster are naturally conveyed. The only failure in the film is the choice of selecting a disgruntled fascist group as the culprits for the attack. Keeping it closer to the story line in the book would have paid off huge dividends in the short and long run. In the years following 2001 and the Sept. 11th attack, using ancient history such as Nazi-like fascists as the enemy just does not play well with an audience. It leaves a huge credibility gap ...this is why it reminds me of the "007" films. Despite this one major flaw, for which I deducted one star, the film was a hit with this viewer. I highly recommend it.<br />Erika Borsos [pepper flower]</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>When I heard that Ben Affleck takes over Jack Ryan role, I sais, like -- "Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan????"  Later I saw this film and I know, you see, Harrison Ford definitely didn't want this script.  It's tired, clithed, 'unworkable' -- the last word being from his interview.  Though I personally don't like him very much, I admit Ford is clever to bail out of the Jack Ryan series.  Yes, even though his anticipated "K-19" turned out a commercial failure.<p>That doesn't mean Ben Affleck is awful.  His is different Jack, so I get over it while watching it.  Though he was much. much, much better in the little-seen (but infinitely superiror) film called "Chasing Amy," Ben is OK.  Just OK, but no complaint.  His love story with Bridget Moynahan is tedious (as is his with lovely Liv in "Armageddon"), but let's talk about something else.  What is really, stinking awful is the story.<p>Jack Ryan, a CIA analyst, after his rather hasty, hot-shot behavior at the high-level military meeting at the US government, is given a job to follow the trace of three missing Russian nuclear scientists.  At the same time, a nuclear bomb that was hidden in the ground of the Golan Heights, falls into the wrong hand.  Those two incidents gradually lead to the catastorophe that happens in Super-Bowl Game in Baltimore.<p>The first half of the film goes steadily, in the fashion of John LeCaree novels.  Without showy explosions or gun-shots, the film maintains its suspence until the event that everyone probably has already known.  The film, until then an OK film, suddenly turns into a sheer nonsense -- actually, the film is from the beginning based on purely imaginative power, not close observation on history (when you loses a A-bomb, you usually try to find it, as Cuba Gooding Jr. film "Men of Honor" tells you), but after the big explosion, everything go derailed.  It's so laughable.<p>As many reviewers seem to have pointed out about the absurd use of computers or internet, let alone Jack Ryan's (who is still a  novice in CIA) amateur diplomatic skill over phone call, so let me add this only.  If you get into the city of Baltimore like he does, it is most certain that he is exposed to (lethal) amount of radioactivity, thus possibly culminating in his early death, or cancer.  Whoever knows something about the deadly accident in Russuan nuclear reactor that happened years ago, or much before, the US soldiers who witnessed the nuclear ground experiments in Nevada, will teach you precious things for Jack to know.  The way "The Sum of All Fears" treats nuclear weapons is a great insult to the victims and our intellect.<p>I know (or hope) the Hollywood really knows the truth; perhaps, they changed the truth for the purpose of entertainment value of the film.  But there's a limit to anything, and there should be in Hollywood.  I tried to ignore this kind of ignorance they commit, for instance, in "True Lies" -- where Tom Arnold tells people, when a nuclear missle explodes out at the sea of Miami, to cover their eyes with hands and it's okay.  Doesn't he know something named radioactivity?  Awful ignorance.<p>I tried to ignore these follies in Hollywood, but couldn't.  (In this sense, "Indepenence Day" was much less absurd in the description of nuclear weapons.)  And they did it again in "The Sum of All Fears."  The second half of the film is, even after forgetting that scene, full of incredible events and bad acting.  Morgan Freeman is good as ever, but his choice of roles is suspect these days; if you see his turn in "Street Smart," you see he is wasting talent in this rubbish.  Ben is so-so, but it is James Cromwell who needs another lecture on his overacting as the US president, and Henry Fonda in "Fail-Safe" would teach him how to play this kind of character. <p>The film ends in very unsatisfactory way, with bad guys punished (like in many other B-action flicks), and good guys smiling, vowing to live in peace, and Ben and Brigdet, talking about love on the sunny, green lawn, as if nothing happened in Baltimore.  This is unacceptable. even at the level of entertainment.  You say this is an entertainment, but are you really "entertained" with this?<p>Arnie's "Collateral Damage" was severely attacked because of its story involving terrorism, but it at least knew what it was doing as entertainment, with its larger-than-life situation and big, loud actions.  "The Sum of All Fears" apparently takes a more serious pose, capitalizing on our growing fear of these days.  But what it offers is insensible, ridiculous Hollywood routine that reaches the offensiveness.  To me, anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/A2U0DKQPZSD50Y.html">A2U0DKQPZSD50Y</a><br/><p>every one is going around saying Ben Aflek is a horrible Jack Ryan but I thought he did a good job.

After watching this movie, I have a clear answer.  This movie is about a nuclear weapon that is found in the desert then sold to an arms dealer.  CIA agent Jack Ryan has been given the task to find out all the details he can about this bomb.  However, no one wants to believe him because of a previous "goof up".  This movie is completely possible and I think that is why it makes it somewhat scary.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFNOZKR9WTYI.html">AIFNOZKR9WTYI</a><br/><p>I'm really starting to wonder if I have contracted some disease which makes me incapable of taking seriously movies that the public at large seems to be drinking down like water.  During the opening scene the movie actually seems like it might be watchable.  Then everything goes right down the can for good and all.  What's that?  You want examples?  Well, again, maybe I'm just nuts, but I just can't sit still for one more movie make out scene where big name actor and actress unconvincingly, passionlessly grope eachother and then kiss eachother openmouthed without tongues.  I mean what IS that?!?!  Its like the make-out equivalent of those movie telephone numbers that all start with 555 in order to give you to understand that its fake, not real, so you don't go out to the lobby and dial the number because you've got nothing else to do and you wind up bothering some old lady in Phoenix.  But exactly what prank are we prevented from by the fake french kissing?  And, if there is some law that stipulates that people in movies can't french kiss, then why bother at all?  Are the audience members supposed to count themselves lucky they got on board with this picture because now they're sitting there in the theater and there's kinda sorta some almost making out?  Anybody who gets turned on by this crudola has got more serious problems than going to a movie is going to solve.<br />Then, there's the matter of dialog.  For example a scene in which Ben Affleck's girlfriend - whom he's just been fake-kissing - is at her post as a med student, scrubbing up before some nameless operation with another female med student who is asking about Affleck's job.  Now, first of all, isn't this talking while scrubbing up scene a bit run into the ground?  I mean do we have to see it yet one more time because the screenwriter just couldn't be bothered to think of something original?  And THEN... so the girlfriend tells her coworker that Affleck is a historian.  THe coworker, who is obviously supposed to be a highly educated if not intelligent person says "Ya-awn!" as if she is twelve years old and palling around with her idiot friends at the local mall.  I mean listen, maybe this person is a piece of garbage, but she as a med student must be no stranger to the mind-numbing tedium of endless details that must be crammed into one's brain to get that big degree.  I'm sure much of medical study is profoundly boring, so where does this chick get off?!?!?</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>THE SUM OF ALL FEARS may be 10 years old not but it packs a wallop no matter how many times it is viewed.  Credit the particular genius of Tom Clancy and his memorable creation of the main character in these suspense/espionage thrillers for that, but at the same time much credit is due screenwriters Paul Attanasio and Daniel Pyne for the tense dialogue and DiRector Phil Alden Robinson for the pacing of this story.  As far as the story is concerned, very briefly the essence can be summarized as follows: When the president of Russia suddenly dies, a man whose politics are virtually unknown succeeds him. The change in political leaders sparks paranoia among American CIA officials, so CIA director Bill Cabot recruits a young analyst to supply insight and advice on the situation. Then the unthinkable happens: a nuclear bomb explodes in a U.S. city, and America is quick to blame the Russians.<br /><br />Jack Ryan was a role that seemed to belong to Harrison Ford in the other Clancy films, but here that role is assumed very well indeed by Ben Affleck. He is capably assisted by Morgan Freeman, James Cromwell, Bruce McGill, Liev Schreiber and Philip Baker Hall along with a large cast of supporting actors.  They give it their all and make this film work on every level. For solid entertainment this is a film that deserves repeated visits.  Grady Harp, December 11</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z5WEA0KOMN9G.html">A2Z5WEA0KOMN9G</a><br/><p>This was a good book that was kind of slow in the beginning but picked up pace after the "event" happened.  It was another book that I stayed up to finish because I couldn't put it down.  The movie had the same feel to it in that regard because it was kind of slow in the beginning but picked up after the "event".<br />That being said, it would have been much nicer had they would have followed the book much closer.  First glaring mistake, in the book the terrorists were Arabs and it made more sense than some secret Right Wing European organization.  I realize that Arab terrorist is a stereotype, but it works.  Nazis make good enemies, but given the circumstances around the event, Arabs made more sense.  Second glaring mistake, Jack Ryan in the book was a much higher level in the CIA but there were some issues surrounding him that made some folks not listen to him.  It finally took a contact on the inside that he knew fairly well to get both sides to stand down.<br />That being said, I thought it was good movie but it would have been much better if it had followed the book.  I thought the scenes at the end showing the escalation were great.  Not quite to Failsafe or Dr. Strangelove levels of tension, but not too bad.  The portrayal of the nuclear blast was the best though.  It was very jarring and that's when the movie picked up.  I especially liked the filmmakers take on what would happen in such an event.  I just hope we never see a real one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EBJ93E1T50RT.html">A1EBJ93E1T50RT</a><br/><p>I didn't pick up "The Sum of all Fears" because I wanted to watch the movie.  I tried, and failed, to read the book a dozen years ago, though since then I've finished a couple of Clancy novels and seen most of the movies.  But when I heard that Clancy -- a tremendously feisty writer who posts to his own Usenet forum -- actually recorded an audio commentary for this DVD, along with the director, Phil Alden Robinson, I just had to be there.<p>The basics of the screenplay are weird.  An elegant European neo-Nazi, with a penchant for fine wine, classical music, and a vaguely non-denominational Austrian accent, inexplicably detonates a nuclear bomb in the middle of the Super Bowl, played in Montreal's Olympic Stadium, which for the movie's purposes is located in South Baltimore.  With me so far?  Good.  Me neither.<p>Clancy verbally abuses Robinson for most of the commentary track by telling him what the movie got wrong.  Mostly this relates to the misuse of boats and fighter planes, or incorrect military jargon.  Robinson takes it all well, calmly explaining his choices, and politely deferring to Clancy on all the minor points.  These two guys obviously share different political views, although it's odd that neither director commented on the 9/11 factor.  The book as written was a lot closer to the 9/11 scenario than the movie's watered-down plot.  Yet Clancy and Robinson never discuss the reasoning behind the change.  One of the more interesting revelations, though, is that the movie's US President (James Cromwell) is based on Michael Dukakis.  Clancy has high praise for Morgan Freeman and Liev Schrieber, but suggests that Bridget Moynihan, who plays Ben Affleck's love interest, needs to eat a couple of hot dogs every day.  Wow!<p>When the movie's over, Robinson tells Clancy it's been "an honor and a pleasure".  Clancy, not missing a beat, replies, "Well, I don't know if it was an honor".<p>You definitely don't want to miss this double act.</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>The Sum of all Fears is a gripping thriller in which a young Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) must by himself stop the US and Russia from blowing each other to pieces via nuclear war.<p>The exciting climax comes about because of a nuclear attack.  The US thinks it is Russia and are prepared to retaliate.  The nuclear attack was in fact caused by a third party.  Here is the problem of the movie.<p>In Clancy's original novel, the terrorists were anti-Israeli Islamic extremists.  Before the 09/11 tragedy, the movie decided to the politically correct route and replace the Islamic terrorists with facist Nazis.  Thus, thousands of Americans die by a nuclear bomb and the movie portrays it as the responsibility of only a few deranged Nazis.  In retrospect, the producers would have made a better movie by keeping the bad guys as the Islamic terrorists, but I don't think anyone would want to see that kind of movie.  It would be too realistic.<p>So Sum of All Fears is a good movie that uses bad guys (Nazis) that aren't really a threat instead of someone like Al Queda, who are a threat, to get to the thrust of the movie.  If you can overlook who the bad guys are, this movie turns out to be really exciting.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Q6R4481YFFG.html">A14Q6R4481YFFG</a><br/><p>The WSJ had an article a few years ago ("How to Market Movie About the Bomb So It Won't Be One," May 30, 2002) where Clancy admitted he changed the bad guys from Arabs to neo-Nazis for the movie because he wanted to be "sensitive to stereotypes."  Pathetic, absolutely pathetic.  Is it a stereotype to say that the biggest terrorist attack in the history of the world was carried out by Arab men?  The one group that Hollywood still feels it can beat up on is neo-Nazis, even if it's completely ridiculous.  I guarantee you, most neo-Nazis in this country are more interested in getting enough money together to buy a six-pack, than trying to get their hands on a nuke to blow up their own country.  Foreign Nazis?  Even more lame.<br /><br />On the other hand, if Clancy (who's an executive producer of the movie, so he's got NO excuse) had had the integrity to keep the Arabs as the bad guys, we could have had an ultra-realistic, prescient, hard-hitting and thought-provoking movie.  Shame on you Mr. Clancy, shame!</p></br><a href="../users/A1A87TUBBDPMF0.html">A1A87TUBBDPMF0</a><br/><p>(this is a corrected version of a review I posted)<br />The Sum of All Fears, the fourth entry in the Jack Ryan film series, may be perhaps the hardest to assess objectively.<p>Viewed purely as a stand-alone action thriller, Sum of All Fears is an above average effort, ranking just below Executive Decision and way above Under Siege 2.  In spite of a tight budget, Phil Alden Robinson (Field of Dreams, Hackers) delivers a post-September 11 cautionary note about terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, and the acting by Ben Affleck, James Cromwell, Morgan Freeman, L. Schreiber, and the others in this ensemble cast is top-notch.  While certainly not flawless, Paul Attanasio and Daniel Pyne's screenplay doesn't try to insult the audience's intelligence by going the James Bond route and having the hero stop the detonation of the bomb and catching the bad guys on his own.  And one has to admire the production staff and cinematographer for maintaining the illusion that this movie does indeed span three continents when it was actually shot mostly in Canada (with the California desert briefly but convincingly doubling for the Middle East).<p>Viewed as a Tom Clancy adaptation, however, one is left to wonder why Mace Neufeld - the producer who bought the film rights to Clancy's fiction - couldn't have made this film earlier while Harrison Ford was still interested in the Ryan role.  As I have said in earlier reviews of these Clancy-based movies, screenwriters have an almost impossible labor when they adapt a thick Clancy novel into a 120 page screenplay.  What makes Clancy's novels compelling to his fans - the large storyline with subplots and secondary characters that are developed further in other novels - doesn't always translate well to the silver screen.  This is true of every Clancy novel-turned-into-film, but the novel that has been altered the most has been Sum of All Fears, and the changes are pretty radical.<p>As most of Clancy's readers are aware, the novels' progression has mostly been centered on Ryan's rise from CIA analyst to (albeit accidentally) President of the United States.  The Sum of All Fears (the book) is the mid-journey transition, where the events at the end will lead to the searing climax of Debt of Honor.  By taking Jack Ryan back in time to the start of his CIA career (and by pretending the other movies don't exist), Neufeld, Attanasio, Pyne, Robinson (and to some degree Clancy himself, since he has an executive producing credit here) have made a hash of this idea.  To what extent Harrison Ford's loss of interest in the Ryan role was involved I can't say.  I am merely a movie watcher and not an insider (otherwise my reviews would be in the papers and not here gratis), but although Affleck is acceptable as a replacement, Ford's reliability, maturity, and steadiness are sorely missed.  Not only that, but by setting the story in 2002 (albeit in a Tom Clancy parallel universe where George W. Bush has been replaced by Robert Fowler), gone is the near-end-of-the-Cold-War urgency that made the novel so suspenseful.  (In one of those bizarre coincidences or flukes of history, the hardcover was released a few days before the failed coup against Gorbachev back in August of 1991!)<p>Not only that, but the novel's cast of villains (an ex-East German terrorist, an ex-Stasi officer, an insane Native American criminal, several radical Palestinians, and a secret supporter) has been replaced by, Ach du lieber Gott, a group of neo-Nazis!  Yes, Alan Bates makes a dapper and almost charming Nazi...in a sense he fares better here than Gregory Peck's hammy performance as Josef Mengele in The Boys from Brazil.  But although I could buy the premise of Black Sunday with Nukes in the novel and could see the blind spot of the villains' plan (okay, the nuke explodes and the USA and USSR wipe each other off the map...and radiation and fallout ruin the northern hemisphere), but in the novel the characters are so bent on revenge (one is dying of cancer anyway, so he doesn't care about the aftermath) that the fatal flaw of their plan is not evident.  Bates' Dressler, however, surely knows - as do his other apparently rich, educated, and old colleagues - that a nuclear exchange between America and Russia will also harm the Europe he is supposedly doing this insanity for.  Anderson says (in the making-of featurette) that the change of villains was forced on the writers by the lack of plausibility of the book's weird mix of German, Native American, and Palestinian conspirators.  I think Paramount and Neufeld simply feared criticism from Arab-Americans here and international audiences abroad, particularly in the wake of 9/11.<p>Other oddities in the film involve the military details.  How does that Russian Backfire bomber squadron find that American carrier on its own?  Why is the carrier shown to be almost defenseless? In the real world, that carrier  (USS Theodore Roosevelt, from her CVN 74 pennant number) would have had an F-14 combat air patrol up, as well as a ring of escorting cruisers and destroyers.  How do the Russians know that B-2A Spirits have taken off from Aviano AB in Italy (they would have been based in Whiteman AFB in Missouri, but never mind)?  And just what kind of radar do the Russians have that can spot a B-2 anyway?<p>Still, the movie does work, quirkily.  It has some really good bits, particularly the scenes with its two leading actors, Affleck and Freeman. Scheiber is actually a more interesting John Clark than the somewhat villainous looking Willem Dafoe (who played Clark in Clear and Present Danger).  James Cromwell, too, fares well as the frazzled President who, when push comes to shove, almost cracks under the strain of the crisis that the Neo-Nazis have unleashed.</p></br><a href="../users/A138826JMC0J3T.html">A138826JMC0J3T</a><br/><p>Do yourself a fovor and leave this one on the shelf and instead pick up the book because Ben Affleck does a horrible job replacing Harrison Ford as Agent Jack Ryan.

If for no other reason than to see Liev Shrieber in a part he excels in as an undercover agent cleaning up potentially national political and/or military messes. I would love to see him in more roles like this. Morgan is a great as usual and Affleck plays his part capably. The storyline change is a little ridiculous at this time since the idea of post war nazi fascist trying to make the US and Russia go to war is a bit cliche as some have pointed out. It really should have stayed with the more believable Middle East connection in the book. Still worth at least a rental. If you enjoyed this be sure to catch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783231180">The Peacemaker (Widescreen Edition)</a>.<br /><br />CA Luster</p></br><a href="../users/A2VJ80PM1G00QV.html">A2VJ80PM1G00QV</a><br/><p>Ben Affleck is a suitably young Ryan to match the fact that he is courting his future wife; Morgan Freeman, as always, is excellent. James Cromwell does well by the President although not always well served by the scriptwriter. There are thrills aplenty as we watch, knowing that an unexploded nuclear bomb has been discovered in the Golan Heights. Who has it? What will they do with it? Finding out provides its share of thrills as the film unfolds. By far, not of the first rank, but sufficient for an entertaining two hours.<br />After my brief comment I read some of the negative reviews. Taste for films varies by individuals, as it  does for most cultural objects. I did not read the book, or if I did, it was too long ago for me to  remember the plot, so I would not comment on the relationship of the screenplay to the novel. However, I am moved, as I often am, vigorously to disagree with the notion that one can translate a book into a movie as if each word projects an exact image on screen. Words on a page are words on a page, images on a screen are images on a screen,  and never the twain will meet. Of course, some poorer novels are written essentially as screenplays so the film-maker has little trouble using them almost as is. Some movies take a highly literate book  and fail because they do not make something new out it. I am entirely on the side of Fred Astaire, who insisted to a person who was being "portrayed" in one of his films, that regardless of what she and her husband had actually done, the film demanded something other than that to be successful. As one of our ages' best artists said of painting, if what is in a painting could be said in words, you have a lousy painting. Painting is for what cannot be communicated any other way. Amusingly, there is a line given to Larry Parks (as Jolson) in Jolson Sings Again, when he is supposed to be working with the writers on The Jolson Story, in which he tells them not to stick to the truth, but to make up a good story.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KB14WCZ1DVE3.html">A2KB14WCZ1DVE3</a><br/><p>... well, not terrible.  I had big reservations about seeing this film, as I had heard how much it had strayed from the book.  Tom Clancy must have more money than some foreign countries.  Doesn't he have enough clout to dictate a true filming of his work?  Or enough money to say "Do it my way or not at all?".  <p>And to some degree I still agree with this thought.  The decision to diminish the Arab role as part of the bad-guy contingent is absolutely unforgivable.  What are they afraid of, that people might actually think that there are forces in the Middle East that would like to plant terror in the United States?  Who could think of such a thing?  No, let's put all the blame on the shoulders of those universal bad guys, the neo-Nazis.  <p>And going back in time in the Jack Ryan series was not a problem to me.  But to have him just meeting his future wife is an irritation.  If gives her the thankless role of playing the suffering girlfriend who sighs as her man saves the world.  Finally, does anybody else notice that the proximity all our heroes are to the nuclear device means that slow death by cancer is just around the corner?<p>All of the above in unforgivable, and yet, the novel was about more than these things.  It was about the sheer ruthlessness of what some people will do to achieve their ends.  This is well portrayed here, though I would have rather seen the religious fanaticism that fuels today's attacks used here.  It's about the toughness of making decisions when your country has just been attacked and you have to decide how many people you're going to kill in return.  And it's about the realization that even though The Cold War is over, the need for a strong military is probably necessary.  <p>Oh yes, Ben as Jack.  The movie does go overboard to show his uncomfortable ness in his new role with the CIA.  They didn't have to hit you over the head with this.  And he seems to know a lot of things that the rest of the world doesn't.  But when it gets down and dirty, he does handle the job credibly, and I wasn't prepared to say this.  I think the plot changes are more serious than casting him in the role, and if they can film a truer book next time, I can accept him as a more-confident Jack next time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Ben Affleck plays a young CIA agent caught in the crossfire between the US and Russia.  A coalition of power-hungry men is contriving to start a war between the two superpowers, in order to gain world domination.  Affleck figures this out while the entire US government seems totally puzzled as to why attacks are suddenly occuring on strategic US locations.  The movie is slick and the action is non-stop, but the premise of a young PhD. who has written a paper about the new Russian president and thus knows his every motivation is a little hard to swallow.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>To date, this is probably the worst Clancy adaptation. Granted, this is set in a time frame before the others, but it is hard to imagine Jack Ryan being THIS incompetent. Come on, even summer interns would not have such problems. Some details are left out or hardly mentioned at all and other trivia goes on and on. Not to mention the lame how-fast-can-we-end-the-movie ending. Seems like the production must have been shut down and they had to scrounge what sections of film they had. Compared to the other Clancy movies I would give it an even lower rating, but since it is watchable in its own right, three stars.</p></br></body></html>

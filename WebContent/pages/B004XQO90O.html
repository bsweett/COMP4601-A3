Each time he learns a little more, but we are not really sure where he is in 'real time' and where it is he is visiting (and I can't reveal too much without spoiling the film.) Jake Gyllenhaal gives a great performance, a fine balance of pathos, anger, fear, and frustration. The supporting cast of Michelle Monaghan (as a woman on the train) and Vera Farmiga (as a military officer involved in the simulation/time travel) are both excellent as well.<br /><br />The action was filmed wonderfully, and the story kept me intrigued. My only complaints, and the reason for the 4-star rating, is that the film dragged at parts, when the Jake G. character returned to the train over and over. It's a difficult scenario to pull off - forcing the viewer to watch the same scene over and over, or at least parts of it - and I felt it did get old. Also, I was still slightly baffled about certain aspects of the plot at the end - as to what the 'source code' exactly was - I felt it needed to be fleshed out a little bit more. But overall, a good film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>In the not-at-all-distant future, the US military runs a trial of their new take on time travel. Through a loosely-explained implementation of cutting edge technology, they're able to insert an unwitting agent into the near past, where he then relives the eight minutes immediately preceding a terrorist attack over and over again, desperately seeking suspects and answers. I'm typically a big fan of this style of high-concept science fiction flicks, and for the great majority of its running time, Source Code manages to continuously one-up itself in that respect. The film doesn't shy away from delivering powerful, surprising answers as events play themselves out, while a deep, complex script ensures there's always a new mystery to pick up where the last one left off. With that nice juicy carrot always dangling just out of reach and a breakneck pace from start to finish, this plays more like an intense, brilliant short film and not the feature-length offering it actually is. Though an awkward, mismatched happy ending does sour things to a certain extent, the sharp curves it navigates before running into that brick wall won't easily be forgotten.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>What can you accomplish in the final eight minutes of your life? Can you save the day? Maybe prevent a bomb from detonating on a train? And if not that, can you reconcile with your estranged family? Or kiss the girl you just fell in love with? SOURCE CODE is a sci-fi thriller, and it's got its clever on. Running at a no-nonsense 94 minutes, it's spare and efficient and that's partly why it works. It drives up that sense of immediacy.<br /><br />If, during the first fifteen minutes or so (or even deeper in), you've become all baffled, then that means the plot's got you where it wants you. This is one of them films that drops a big reveal every few minutes. It helps that our reluctant protagonist is in the same state of bewilderment. 17th Airborne helicopter pilot, Army Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) suddenly finds himself on a Chicago commuter train seated opposite a lovely co-passenger chatting him up familiarly. Not too long after he glances at a mirror and sees someone else's face gazing back at him. And eight minutes after he'd first come to, the train explodes, killing everyone onboard, including him, false face and all.<br /><br />Colter Stevens now finds himself holed up in a sort of containment pod in some nebulous Army lab. A scientist informs him of the tragic train bombing which had happened earlier that day. She mentions experimental technology which would allow his consciousness to be projected onto the last eight minutes of the memories of one of the victims. Except that Colter Stevens would be able to act and therefore alter those memories. It's not really time travel, but for brevity's sake and because it's a sexier label, let's stick with that. Colter's mission is to locate the explosive device on the train and unearth the bomber... in eight minutes' time. You can see why the guy would need to be sent back time and again. With each reinsertion, with each new variation on how these eight minutes play out, Colter gets that much closer to piecing the puzzle together. And, somewhere along the way, he falls in love with that lovely co-passenger. And since she's being played by Michelle Monaghan who simply has this way about her, it's understandable.<br /><br />Operation Beleaguered Castle is the experimental program what's guinea-pigging Colter Stevens, and this venture just may end up saving countless lives, except that there's such a dehumanizing element involved. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a strong, wired performance as our hero purposely kept in the dark for a huge chunk of the film. He's strongly advised to not dig into his own recent past. Our guy demonstrates his ornery streak.<br /><br />Obviously, given the premise, there are bits of parallelism with films like GROUNDHOG DAY, 12:01, and DEJA VU, and if you're a fan of time travel (although, again, this isn't really time travel), you'll lap up what unfolds on the screen. Even if, in spots, you're rendered bewildered and perplexed and confounded (but having tremendous fun, all the same). I will say that I do agree with some of them other folks what said SOURCE CODE should've ended with the freeze frame sequence. That would've carried a more potent and poignant statement. Instead, the film trots out several codas too many, opts for a more conventional and rather chickensh_- ending. But that's my only bugaboo. This is a ripper of a movie, thrilling and surprising and smart and mostly full of good choices. And they're playing me for a sucker but I can't help but be amused each time Jake Gyllenhaal's character is told "Everything's gonna be okay." And then the train explodes, unfailingly.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XT8AJB7S9JJG.html">A1XT8AJB7S9JJG</a><br/><p>"What would you do if you knew you only had one minute to live?"  Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal) is picked to be part of a new and secret plan.  He is able to relive the last eight minutes of someones life over and over in order to stop terrorist activity.  The only problem is that he doesn't realize it at first.  His goal is to find out who bombed a train in Chicago in order to stop a bigger and more deadly explosion later in the day, but Colter wants to change the plans, if he can.  This is a very good movie, but one you must pay attention to in order to follow it easily.  This is from the same director of "Moon", so if you have seen that movie you will know what to expect from this movie.  This is a movie that would get better the more you watch, very layered type of movie and you will be able to catch different things each time you watch.  One of the better sci-fi/thrillers along the lines of "Inception" and "Adjustment Bureau", not as good as those, but comparisons could be drawn.  Overall, a very interesting movie that needs to be seen more then once in order to fully get what you need out of it.  I liked it though.  I give it a B+.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Yes I would, you almost should.<br /><br />*Also try - Speed Of Thought & Moon</p></br><a href="../users/A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE.html">A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE</a><br/><p>This movie puts a new spin on the possibility of changing realities. It is a wild mix of the movies: D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu and Ground Hog Day. And yes there is the element of a terrorist bomb and yes there is an iterative segment of time involved, in this case it is only 8 minutes.<br /><br />The storyline centers around Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal)- an American Army helicopter pilot whose last memory is flying in Afghanistan. He then wakes up on a commuter train, but he looks like someone else.<br /><br />The movie starts off like an adventure computer game, where you are thrown into a scenario where you are not sure where you are and what is really happening. As the movie progresses, you begin to realize that Colter is also in the same position, being totally unaware of his full situation.<br /><br />The movie is very interesting and like the case with Ground Hog Day, in each iteration of the eight minutes, Colter gets more and more done. The story is quite gripping and unfolds on two levels:<br /><br />- [1] the Train bomb situation<br />- [2] the real situation of Colter Stevens<br /><br />The latter is quite moving emotionally and draws you into a deep longing that Colter has to make peace with his father and to hear his voice just one last time.<br /><br />So, although it may not be quite original in its design, there is a lot of emotional content to absorb the viewer in. In my opinion, it is a good movie and well portrayed. The end had a nice twist to it. Enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>Source Code is a suspenseful, surprisingly intelligent, occasionally touching, movie that's far better than I'd expected it to be. With tight pacing, great editing, good acting and fine directing by Duncan Jones, best known for Moon, it's a very good sci-fi action film released outside the usual summertime area for such movies.<br /><br />The film tells the tale of a man (Jake Gyllenhall), who wakes up on a train. He has no idea why he's there or who the woman across from him is. As he's trying to get things sorted out, an explosion goes off, killing everyone. He then comes to inside a capsule where it's explained to him that the train was blown up in a terrorist bombing. The terrorist was kind enough to do a practice run and apparently plans to detonate a dirty bomb in Chicago. Due to some sort of "quantum" effect he can "leap" into the body of a man who died on the train and live out his last eight minutes of life. Doing that will, with luck, enable him to find the bomber.<br /><br />If it's a premise that sounds familiar, that's because it is. It's perhaps no surprise that Scott Bakula's voice turns up in a cameo during the movie, since it clearly owes a lot to his most famous work. In fact, it's basically Quantum Leap mashed-up with Groundhog Day while managing to be better than the first and at least as engaging as the second.<br /><br />There was really nothing I disliked about this film. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's the best film I've seen so far this year, and, sadly, will likely be the best science fiction film for quite some time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>**1/2.

That's not the case here.  This is a story built layer upon layer, playing out in bits and getting stronger as it goes along.<br /><br />I didn't expect this at all.  I expected the opposite.<br /><br />This story is told so well, that the viewer becomes emotionally invested in it.  In it's outcome, and the possibilities it presents.<br /><br />A very suspenseful, thoughtful, and witty piece of storytelling craftsmanship.<br /><br />I like being brought into a film, and this does just that.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>It has been more than a month since I saw Source Code. I have not seen any better film this year. Also, Jake Gylenhaal is perfect for this role and the acting and script are tight.  This is the thriller of thrillers. The suspense, tension, acting, drama and action will leave you gasping for more, yes it's one of those films. Highly recommended. Vera Farmiga, like always, had her good moments in the film too. At 94 minutes this film is really riveting.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up to find himself in the middle of a conversation with a beautiful woman (Michelle Monaghan) he finds himself on a commuter train to Chicago. 8 min. later he is dispatched by an explosive. Once again he wakes up to find himself disoriented and being interrogated by an Air Force officer (Vera Farmiga). It seems that he has a mission and will relive those same 8 min. over again until he completes the objective. However Colter may have objectives of his own. As the story unfolds with Colter and the people he interacts with get closer to both objectives we go along for the ride.<br /><br />As you know there are several movies out there with the same theme is time or the essence of time being allowed to change over again so that you can right your mistakes. This movie of course is one of them. It may not be set apart from a lot of other movies that you seem with similar themes; however it is excellent in both visuals and story setting. You will not be disappointed in taking the time to view this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>Though some might say he's there already, I'd say Jake is just getting going. He's so ridiculously likeable, but somewhat distant, yet always engagingly intelligent in alomst everything he does...it's a unique take on things and every time out he brings it home. Same as always here, with a good script milking the old time travel cliches to fit our current manufactured obsession with the guaranteed-to-be-never-ending War On Terror. With the wrong lead this film could really blow, but Gyllenhall keeps it happening from start to finish.<br /><br />Source Code is another crisp character study of one man up against oblivion, as with the director's first film, Moon, and it works just as well. Come to think of it, Jake and Sam Rockwell would be an excellent pairing in a movie. Hello, Hollywood...<br /><br />There's a lot of Philip K. Dick in here, from ideas to tone, and the best part is the clever ending, which borrows from many previous time travel works to fashion a best-of-genre ending that's cheesy yet also pretty satisfying, using technology to fulfill our desire for immortality along with happy endings (oxymoronic though that may be...hey, no one ever said we were that smart...). Yet the final conceit, the morally upright soldier doing what's right against her superior's wishes, is a great concept but almost non-existent in the real world military. We only wish our soldiers put people before protocol. Oh well, this is a fantasy after all...<br /><br />If you like sci-fi or Gyllenhall (in super crisp hi-def blu-ray closeups!) or some edgy, mostly non-violent suspense, Source Code will keep you locked into an interesting mind loop for an hour and a half of your life.<br /><br />Or was it 8 minutes?</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>`Source Code' does what `<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012QCZ5O">Vantage Point (Single-Disc Edition)</a>' tried to do, but failed.  It makes us look at a public scene where some imminent violence or calamity is about to take place, and then backs up to show us the same scene again with a different point-of-view.  (Except this time, the protagonist relives the same moments and scenes on a commuter train.)  As has been stated time and time again, `Source Code''s method may be preposterous science fiction--like anime' adventure `<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VWYJ68">Paprika</a>--' but its thrust is decidedly more closely aligned to `<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Z8GZYW">Groundhog Day (Special 15th Anniversary Edition)</a>'.<br /><br />The story begins with a disoriented Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) who finds himself on a commuter train headed to Chicago.  Next to him is a woman identifying herself as his girlfriend, Christine (Michelle Monaghan).  A serious of events take place:  Someone spills coffee on his shoe; he gets up; someone knocks over a file with papers in it; and he goes to the bathroom where a mirror shows him to be someone else than he knows himself to be.<br /><br />After a series of awkward moves, he sees his train pass another train, and both blow up into oblivion...Then, we are taken into a military vessel, much resembling a small space unit, where Colter is received on a screen with instructions from Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) who gets him to use a "source code" technology, which enables him to relive the scene, find information, and prevent otherwise inevitable catastrophe.<br /><br />He fights the mission with a fervent confusion--not able to fully comprehend when he was on an earlier mission--not in incognito and on the war front of Afghanistan.  To get him on track, Goodwin and her superior officer, Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright), have to brief him as quickly as possible because their intelligence program is in experimental infancy with many harrowing risks for Colter and civilization at large...<br /><br />The causality of `Source Code' is easily as fanciful as `<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG980U">Inception</a>,' but the story is much easier to follow, and the format and development admirably suspend disbelief in ways that few movies do.  While similar movies can be awkwardly paced, tediously unfolded, or convoluted beyond our senses, `Source Code' is satisfying popcorn entertainment with an admirable message about the brevity and preciousness of life without ever being weighed down by stale or labored moments.<br /><br />(Credit information is taken from IMDB.com)</p></br><a href="../users/A3FEQXNCFC68KC.html">A3FEQXNCFC68KC</a><br/><p>I have heard a lot of people describing this movie in different ways. It's Quantum Leap mixed with Groundhog Day. It's Sliders mixed with Murder on the Orient Express. It's The Matrix mixed with Journeyman. You get so many variations on what people find in the movie but they all come down to a decisive trend in everybody's minds. Source Code cannot be easily defined in relation any single movie made prior. The best anybody can do is grab pieces of other films to best describe the experience they had. And you know what? They are all correct.<br /><br />Source Code is part science fiction, part mystery, part thriller, part love story, part action film and for some there are even more aspects. Even worse the science fiction side can also be considered part Twilight Zone, part time travel, part alternate realities, and even part theoretical science. In other words this movie defies a lot of standard conventions and gives you an experience you will not ever have had from any movie before it.<br /><br />The basic premise of the film is a man in the military is going back in time to find out who planted a bomb on a train in order to prevent and even worse bombing. He only has eight minutes each time he goes back. This setup opens up a whole intricate mess of subplots and developing stories. First the soldier (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) tries to get a handle on what happened to him. Then he tries various techniques in gathering clues on who the bomber is. Then he gets emotionally involved. It gets even more interesting from there.<br /><br />The story evolves in a way that is both fast paced and well developed at the same time. Gyllenhaal's character gets new revelations and the movie switches lanes each time seamlessly. I swear this film could have been retooled as a miniseries it covers so many different poignant elements, yet the pacing still feels comprehensive in it's movie length running time instead of rushed. This is a rare ability for a film and Director Duncan Jones really hits the nail on the head with it.<br /><br />The sci-fi aspects are understated. Other than seeing the inside of a contraption and the zap back into time the movie uses science fiction as only a vehicle to move into the more interesting film aspects like the mystery and detective work of finding the bomber, the suspense of wondering what will happen, and the thrills when things start falling into place. It's more of a real world kind of film from there.<br /><br />Production is very well done. Special effects are relegated mostly to the background with notable exceptions on the time travel and train explosions (which are done with a more creative dramatic effect than just seeing things go boom). Acting is quite good all around. This isn't much of a drama so nobody is really being pushed on their acting chops. There is a nice bit of emotion on the final act so don't count this movie out in that area either.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray release will be presented in 5.1 DTS-HD audio and will just a few extras. Looks like the Blu-Ray will essentially have same stuff that's going to be on the DVD. Only presented differently. Here's what's been announced so far:<br /><br />Audio Commentary - With director Duncan Jones, writer Ben Ripley and star Jake Gyllenhaal. From hearing Duncan Jones in other commentaries and interviews I am looking forward to his input.<br /><br />Access: Source Code - This is an interactive 'feature' tied to specific scenes in the movie. It will include cast interviews, scientific commentary on time travel, trivia and other tidbits. Some sources are claiming this stuff will be on a separate menu as well, but the cover photos I have seen only mention this picture-in-picture version only. Kind of bugs me if that's true. The DVD will have this stuff on separate menus only.<br /><br />Source Code is a very well made movie that turns whatever genre you feel it best fits in on its ear. It's both complex and easy to follow with a great mix of action, thrills and emotions that would seem to please just about every viewer. Watch this movie.

I kept thinking of what happened to Captain Pike at the end of the Star Trek TV episode.  But that's ok.<br /><br />I should also mention that even on my ancient tube television the opening shots of Chicago are just friggin spectacular.  I'm guessing this has to do with the use of a Red camera about which I know little except that it's state of the art.

Much of the credit for this quality comes from the intelligent and imaginative writing of Ben Ripley and the tight direction by Duncan Jones, but the main reason this film works so well is the presence of charismatic and fine acting by Jake Gyllenhaal.<br /><br />The story borders on the obtuse: a device has been invented by Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) that can maintain a person in a state of recall much the way a light bulb has a glow after it has been extinguished.  Rutledge has placed helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is missing in action in Afghanistan, in a capsule that is capable, under the direction of military officer Goodwin (Vera Farmiga), of projecting Stevens  onto a train entering Chicago that has been planted with a bomb in order to discover the perpetrator who is apparently planning another bomb that will decimate the city of Chicago.  It is a back and forth series of 8 minute exercises, each time Stevens relives the moments before a bomb detonation and gradually learns the the device and its owner. On board the train he meets Christina (Michelle Monaghan) who 'sees' Stevens as her boyfriend Sean and during these repeat flashbacks Stevens and Christina form a bond that makes Stevens re-think his 'purpose' in this military gimmicky.<br /><br />*In the hands of the wrong people this little venture would seem trite and silly, but with this crew of creators it becomes a puzzle that touches on tension, fear, humor, and warmth.  That is what a superb cast can do with any material, but with this particular strange tale it works perfectly.  Grady Harp, July 11</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Source Code" is director Duncan Jones' second feature film, after the existential science fiction drama "Moon" (2009) took viewers back to the thoughtful sci-fi of the 1970s. Elements of that style are in evidence in the unretouched look of "Source Code", which, in spite of its contemporary setting, shares some of the same themes. Capt. Colter Stephens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up on a Chicago-bound commuter train not knowing where he is or how he got there. The last thing he remembers was being a helicopter pilot with the 17th Airborne in Afghanistan. Now he sits opposite a woman named Christina (Michelle Monaghan), who calls him Sean and seems friendly. Colter's reflection in the mirror is unfamiliar to him, and, before he can figure it out, the train explodes in a fiery ball.<br /><br />Now Colter is strapped into a capsule as a woman speaks to him through a monitor screen about an operation called Beleaguered Castle. She tries to help him regain cogent thought processes. Her name is Capt. Goodwin (Vera Farmiga), and she explains that the train he was just on exploded this morning, killing those aboard. Colter's mission is to go back and find the bomber, so a second terrorist attack can be prevented. He has 8 minutes. He's not traveling back in time, but into the residual memories of a man who was killed on the train. And so Colter goes back to the train, Christina, the explosion, the capsule, Capt. Goodwin. Again and again, as he hunts for the bomber, an understanding of himself, and of the implications of the technology that enables him.<br /><br />It reminded me of "Moon" in its identity crisis and artificial reality, constructed for the benefit, or imprisonment, of the protagonist. This has a slicker, action-movie tone, though, rather than the contemplative pace of 1970s sci-fi. There is romance, action, and existentialism. And "Source Code", the mind-bending fusion of quantum mechanics and neurobiology that sends Colter into a dead man's memories, is billed as "a powerful weapon in the War on Terror." I felt the ending was a bit of a cop-out, and I'm not sure that it makes sense. But Colter's existential adventure does make sense, and there is enough action to keep the audience engaged even though, like our protagonist, we keep ending up back on the same train. Duncan Jones is now two-for-two and a promising talent.<br /><br />The DVD (Summit Entertainment 2011): There are 2 featurettes, an optional Trivia Track that you can run during the film, and an audio commentary. "Cast and Crew Insights" (35 min) interviews cast and director about themes, characters, and each other, in 11 parts. Some nice comments, but it is repetitive and too long. "Focal Points" (7 min) presents the technical ideas used in the film in 5 parts: memory recall, military virtual reality simulations, quantum physics, many worlds theory, and brain computer interface. The audio commentary is by director Duncan Jones, actor Jake Gyllenhaal, and writer Ben Ripley. They compare the film to earlier drafts, discuss technical details and directorial decisions, filming, and Gyllenhaal shares his experiences.

It looked really stupid, some sort of action packed `Groundhog Day' and I'm still not sold on the idea of Jake Gyllenhaal being a good actor (his sister on the other hand is tremendous) so I remember seeing the trailer for this and thinking "no need to see that" but then the reviews rolled in and word of mouth was good and so, with nothing better to do, the wife and I settled in for a watch.<br /><br />The basic premise is that Jake Gyllenhaal is a bomber pilot named Colter Stevens who has been recruited for a special mission where he relives the last 8 minutes of a terrorist attack victim's life in order to uncover who the terrorist was and how to prevent it from happening again.  He lives out those 8 minutes and then dies only to be rebooted back at the same spot to relive it again in an attempt to uncover as much information as he can so that they can save as many people as possible.  Once in his new body, Colter forms a quick friendship with Christina, a young woman accompanying his host, but his desire to help himself out of the situation and write his own fate (or be a bigger hero) begins to fray the edges of his mission.<br /><br />Gyllenhaal carries the film very well, but the entire cast is solid here.  Monaghan is a beauty (stunning, really) and she flirts in all the right angles.  Jeffrey Wright is perfectly creepy in his mysterious role, and Michael Arden slays his character's reveal.  It is Vera Farmiga though who once again solidifies her current status in Hollywood.  I just love this woman!<br /><br />`Source Code' is fast paced and exciting and uses its premise in a way that really works.  It also sets itself up for a sequel, one that I'll be anxious to see...so here's to hoping they don't botch that one up!</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>SOURCE CODE (dir. Duncan Jones, 2011, 93 minutes AND I WILL POSSIBLY SPOIL THIS WITHOUT INTENTION) is an ocean of fun, Hitchcockian suspense and metaphysics, unbearable tension, extreme silliness - all this meant as a wrapping for some deep moral dilemmas.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal plays Captain Colter Stevens, an experimental subject (with an emphasis on the "mental"). He is meant to retrieve as much data as possible to find a bomber who is heading toward Chicago. The trouble is, he is supposed to find this bomber, if he can, in the past. This is a reboot of GROUNDHOG DAY, 13 MONKEYS, TRON and any other similarly great, silly films. A really good clue: this film is very reminiscent of an old "Star Trek: The Next Generation" episode called "A Matter of Perspective", episode 62, 3rd season, in which Cmdr. Riker is accused of murder, and a hologram reconstruction of the crime is carefully studied. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6303406378">Star Trek - The Next Generation, Episode 62: A Matter Of Perspective [VHS</a>])<br /><br />The problem as I see it is an immense, unnecessary flaw in the story and plot. The film seems like time travel. It isn't. It also seems like it's communication with the dead. Well, almost. The flaw is that this movie vacillates between two mutually annihilating stories/technologies. It is impossible to reconcile them unless you decide time's components themselves are parallel universes. Even then, better to avoid bogging the movie down with too much thinking. They even tell Capt. Stevens that in the film.<br /><br />No surprise, then, that this occasionally bass-ackward movie stands its manifold messages on their heads, which is the brilliant fun of it. From the uselessness of contacting the dead to help us, to the little value we place on our soldiers while asking them to sacrifice it all. From the hysteria of preventing terrorism to the hysteria of becoming the most famous savior of the world. From secret government projects to playing God. It's all here, and it is spooky. Hitchcock, Kurosawa and Gilliam did this kind of thing much better - yet they would never have dreamt of trying what SOURCE CODE accomplishes.<br /><br />With the brilliant talents of Jeffrey Wright as Dr. Rutledge and Vera Farmiga as Captain Colleen Goodwin, a PLANET OF THE APES soundtrack and non-stop action, this instant classic cannot be missed. In spite of the migraine I obtained by thinking out all the stupid things they did with the logic here, I loved it. Took away a star for the migraine, thanks a lot Hollyweird ....</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>SPOILER CODE: There is no time travel.<br /><br />I ascribe to that theory for my current modern conspiracy Delta Green role-playing campaign, and so does Source Code.  The premise is simple, if considerably underused in science fiction.  Source Code seeks to correct that imbalance. Like Donnie Darko, Source Code posits that perception is reality. There's no such thing as one time stream, but rather multiple streams formed every time a decision is made.<br /><br />Source Code uses this many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics to fight the war on terror. Army helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is co-opted to investigate a terrorist attack on a train in Chicago. He jumps into the body of Sean Fentress, a school teacher, who is traveling with his attractive but platonic companion Christina Warren (adorable Michelle Monaghan).  It doesn't end well.<br /><br />Air Force Captain Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) soon dispels Stevens' confusion: he has eight minutes to go back into the Source Code, a snapshot of reality that's basically a highly interactive video game.  Time is of the essence, so Stevens is sent back into the Source Code again and again to find the bomb and the identity of the terrorist, his reservations notwithstanding. It's about this time that Source Code starts to strain under the weight of its plot.<br /><br />Stripped to its basics, Source Code is basically a two-person play about relationships, one in person (Stevens/Warren) and the other long-distance (Stevens/Goodwin).  The camera pulls in tight on Gyllenhall and Farmiga as they engage in alternately pained, exasperated, frustrated, and flirty conversations.  It pulls out to appreciate Monaghan's loveliness and Gyllenhall's handsome profile.  This is an actor's movie.<br /><br />It's also a Duncan Jones film, who is fast becoming a modern-day Phillip K. Dick as he tackles questions of self in his films. Like Moon, Source Code is as much about the definition of reality as it advances the plot.<br /><br />Which is perhaps why the resolution isn't particularly compelling.  Source Code studiously avoids any hint of political controversy by having a bland villain with little motivation. It telegraphs its plot twists. And its ending is a little too neat for my tastes.  But then, Source Code is more interested in poking your brain than tugging your heart strings.  Jones' primary goal seems to be focused on getting the audience to view time travel differently, and in that regard Source Code is a resounding success.  I finally grokked the basics of quantum mechanics thanks to the extras on the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br /> The concept where a particular past juncture in time is re-visited in order to effect a change in future circumstances, was marvelously handled in the brilliant comedy-fantasy, 'Groundhog Day'. 'Source Code' utilizes a similar concept, but here it should basically be subsumed under the genre of Sci-fi Thriller. Unlike 'Groundhog Day', which repeatedly brings a time-tripping Bill Murray back to the past by sleight of hand, 'Source Code' provides a pseudo-scientific rationale, which proves in the end to be decidedly derivative of other time travel tales we've seen before.<br /><br />Our protagonist, former Army helicopter pilot, Colter Stevens, now severely injured and in a comatose state, is being used as part of a secret US Army project dubbed 'Source Code', to uncover the identity of an individual who bombed a Chicago commuter train, earlier that day. The creator of the project, Dr. Rutledge, and his assistant, Air Force Captain Goodwin, repeatedly keep sending Stevens back eight minutes prior to the bombing inside an experimental device which resembles a space capsule, in order to find out who planted the bomb so they can stop him from detonating an even more destructive dirty bomb in downtown Chicago, which the bomber has promised to do an hour later.<br /><br />Stevens learns that he's unable to change events in the future reality which Goodwin and Rutledge are a part of, and is only able to be an observer. The Source Code enables Stevens to enter the body of one of the now deceased victims, Sean Fentress, and move about on the train in a parallel universe. While the basic events in each alternate time line are the same (the bomber always plants the bomb in the same place), due to Stevens/Fentress acting differently in each time line, the exact sequence of events is changed. The concept derives from 'Groundhog Day', where the core events end up as variations on a theme. The interactive aspect of the protagonist's abilities, can also be likened to the Star Trek holodeck, where a user is able to interact with a series of images which are mere projections of reality.<br /><br />One can argue with all the pseudo-scientific explanations but the films' scenarists are basically asking the audience to suspend one's disbelief when it comes to the main premise. For some this is a big problem, but I found other areas of the film to take issue with. One of screenwriter Ben Ripley's big quandaries is how to develop Stevens' character arc in eight minute segments. You'll recall that Bill Murray's 'Phil' character in 'Groundhog Day' was a narcissist who needed to learn an important life's lesson about being a nice guy. He has a whole day (repeated multiple times) to transform himself. Here, we learn virtually nothing about Fentress as his back story is a cypher. When Stevens becomes Fentress, Ripley has him gradually warming up to the film's love interest, Christina Warren, after he acts gruffly toward her when Stevens makes his first 'time trip'. But Stevens/Fentress acts badly at first because Stevens is disoriented not because he has a character defect. So the transformation seems unnecessary and forced since Steven's only real goal is to prevent the bomber from causing further havoc.<br /><br />Equally less charming are the assorted characters Stevens must deal with on the train and the methods he employs to find out whether they might be the particular villain he's looking for. Again, a comparison to 'Groundhog Day' is instructive. All of the characters Phil interacts with in the Groundhog Day universe, are utterly quirky and charming. Here, they're stereotypical--either obnoxious (bad comedian) or ineffectual (computer geek). What's more, Ripley lacks the imagination to come up with a series of interesting variants. All Stevens/Fentress ends up doing is awkwardly confronting each one of his suspects by ripping the bags they're carrying and spilling the contents on the ground and getting into some kind of physical or verbal confrontation.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest clue that 'Source Code' lacks gravitas, is in its choice of a convincing antagonist. Heaven forbid that Mr. Ripley would attempt to create a bad guy rooted in today's headlines. Instead of perhaps an Al Qaeda sympathizer, we're presented with a Mad Bomber of the 1950s dressed up as a modern day disaffected techie. When both the bad guys and the good guys in your movie don't seem very real, the stakes aren't very high and hence the tension on the 'suspense' meter, has got to be very low!<br /><br />Finally, there's the whole question of a so-called 'twist ending' that doesn't seem to be very surprising at all. Remember, according to the rules of the alternate time line, changing events in a parallel universe, cannot change anything in the present real world. So when Stevens sends the text message to Goodwin that he's stopped the bomber and that the Source Code experiment worked, and Goodwin and Rutledge aren't even aware that any of those events have transpired, that's not the same world we experienced at the beginning of the film. Rather, it's an alternate universe where the 'happy ending' of Sean and Christina walking off into the sunset, is a reality. One other thing that did bother a lot of other people who have posted on the internet, is what happened to Sean once Stevens takes over his consciousness? I guess he's left screaming, inside the mirror!<br /><br />Back in the real world, the reality of the train bombing remains unchanged. We do wonder, after all those time jumps, did Stevens have enough time to actually communicate the information about the bomber to Rutledge and Goodwin? Couldn't the bomber have easily driven to downtown Chicago and set off his dirty bomb given how much time Stevens was taking with his jumps and inside the capsule?<br /><br />Source Code looks and feels more like a movie made exclusively for the Syfy channel. It keeps your interest in a basic way but certainly doesn't deserve all the accolades heaped upon it to date.</p></br><a href="../users/A7P9LPMSBAAME.html">A7P9LPMSBAAME</a><br/><p>that's all folks.

Stevens finds himself in an experimental device that allows users to undergo the last eight minutes of their lives within an alternative timeline, and requested to discover the location of the bomb on the train and identify who set it off. Supposedly this train blast is a precursor to a larger dirty nuclear device that will be detonated in downtown Chicago. It's just too complicated, too unrealistic, and too long.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>Source Code, 2011 film<br /><br />The story begins with a view of the Chicago waterfront. One man rides a train; he seems stunned and unaware of himself. A double-decker train carries commuters to Chicago. There is an explosion outside! Next there is a strange event where he is questioned. "Who bombed the train?" We return to the train. More strange behavior. He searches a restroom and finds a strange machine. He warns the crew. There is an explosion. Is it real? Is it confusing? "This makes no sense." Who is the bomber? Quiet and withdrawn? "Anything strange on the train?" [The actors in this story?] He gets off the train to follow a man. Motion sickness? There is a fight, a man falls on the tracks. Then we see more strange events. Who is controlling things? We finally learn of the reason for this exercise: a terrorist will explode a "dirty bomb" in Chicago!<br /><br />His next assignment is to find the conducter's room. He fails in this. "Everything is going to be OK." The scenes repeat. The man acts strange. He borrows a phone from a lady. There is another change of scenery. "Am I dead?" Is he imagining all this? His controllers speak to him. Can he find the bomber? "Send me back in." He finds the bomb with its cell phone activator. Did he find the bomber? "Sorry." He follows another man. Will he lose him? "I know its you." There is a surprise in the trunk. The man explains his actions. "There has to be rubble." He now has the bomber's name. He has a last request. The SWAT team gets the driver. A job well done. The story runs on. Will his mission be terminated? "Thank you for your service. Good luck!" So now the story repeats again. Shawn disarms the bomb.<br /><br />Will they clear his memory? He stops Derek Frost. "It's over." He makes a phone call. Then another to a dead soldier's father. "Are you OK?" There is conversation among the passengers. They are not friendly. Shawn makes a bet with a man; can he make the other passengers laugh? The red button is pushed. We see the body! "It is a beautiful morning in Chicago." "Do you believe in fate?" "So what do you want to do today?" Goodwin gets a text message on her phone. "Tell him everything will be OK."<br /><br />This is a very strange story that repeats itself over and over (to create padding and make it appear that something is happening). Not recommended. It shows why the story or plot is the most important part of any movie. The end shows a long list of names for the people who worked on this production. So who paid for this production? There were other movies about people being threatened by terrorists with a bomb. They were all better.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>I'll admit I went in to Source Code with zero expectations at all- it didn't look very appealing from the trailer. However, I'll admit I did like a few parts. There are a couple scenes of gorgeously shot, tear-jerkingly beautiful brilliance. That, and the cinematography is worth noting- It is very slick and tone-setting. But the way this movie plays out, it's almost like a parody of the intellectial science fiction thriller.<br /><br />The story has been done before- a computer program where you are allowed to enter someone's body. The Matrix did it, and to a lesser extent but not in the form of a computer program- Being John Malkovich, that movie where a portal was opened in an office building and you could enter John Malkovich's mind for a few minutes. Except here, the program is so that Jake Gyllenhaal can find the bomber of a train.<br /><br />The acting is unbelievably bad. I felt like I was watching a cheaply made TV movie. Gyllenhaal was acted off the screen by that ridiculous hairpiece of his. The plot is so deathly slow, dull, and takes nearly forever to get going, and one of the worst endings EVER absolutely ruins what could have been a good action thriller to begin with. Overall, avoid.<br /><br />OVERALL: 2/10<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Gorgeously shot<br />-Nice special effects<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Pretty much everything else<br />-One of the worst scripts of 2011, almost this year's "Salt"<br />-Boring buildup to a total non-conclusion<br />-Some of the worst acting this side of Community Theatre</p></br><a href="../users/APBB297H3ZA5E.html">APBB297H3ZA5E</a><br/><p>1.

It was just very boring watching these people act their roles.  And then... the story itself was convoluted / unrealistic / dumb etc...<br /><br />2.  Thus, when you have terrible acting and a more lame / convoluted plot line=a complete dud of a movie.<br /><br />3.  By the way, another piece of evidence that this movie is a complete dud:  it's on amazon prime streaming.

Moon (2009) saw Sam Rockwell turn in a very good performance and Source Code has built on that success. Jones has attracted a wonderful cast and the $32 million budget allows for a more spectacular presentation. Moon reminded me of older classics such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, but Source Code feels like a modern story.<br /><br />The movie is a thriller with a strong science fiction element, but it also plays like a mystery. The opening scene shows Captain Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal) on a train in Chicago. When he sees his reflection in the window of the train, it's not him. Christina (Monaghan), the woman in the opposite seat, calls him Sean. A few minutes later we see the train explode and Stevens wakes up alone in a chamber of some kind.<br /><br />Jones shows us everything from the viewpoint of Stevens, so we only gradually come to understand the situation. Stevens is part of an experimental project which enables him to inhabit the body of somebody else. The project is led by Dr. Rutledge (Wright) and Colleen Goodwin (Farmiga).<br /><br />They can only communicate with Stevens by using a camera and a computer screen. He's told that he must find out where the bomb is and uncover the person responsible for planting it. He can't avoid the explosion, but the information could prevent a future disaster involving the bomber. He can only inhabit the body of Sean for eight minutes at a time. So we see Stevens trying to gather information. Each time the train explodes, the pattern resets and he tries again. It's like a blend of Groundhog Day and Quantum Leap.<br /><br />We have a race against the clock to prevent further terrorism and that keeps us on the edge of our seats. There's also the chance of romance between Sean and Christina, as well as great special effects. Comedian Russell Peters provides most of the comic relief. This package has plenty to keep us hooked. At the outset I expected one of the twists to be that Sean turns out to be the bomber, but I was wrong. Couldn't Stevens simply take over the body of the bomber on his next visit once he found out who it was, or does the technology only allow you to access people who are "compatible" with you?<br /><br />Put yourself in that position for a moment. If you were a train passenger tasked with uncovering the identity of a bomber, how would you proceed? Would you be polite to total strangers as you questioned them? How about contacting the guard and explaining the situation? Whatever course of action you choose, the train will explode in eight minutes (unless you locate and disarm the bomb). That allows Jones to break the established rules somewhat. If the pattern resets each time, he can do anything. Sean can be rude, engage in criminal activity, or follow incredibly dangerous courses of action. He could even kill or be killed. That makes the movie less predictable than most.<br /><br />I won't reveal what does happen, but hopefully I've described the situation well enough for you to know whether you'll like the movie.<br /><br />The movie raises some serious themes such as how the line between right and wrong can become blurred. In a sense it also deals with the issue of slavery, just as Moon did.<br /><br />Jones has produced another interesting idea and turned it into a thrilling story. The four main actors turned in good performances and the whole thing worked well for me. I'm a fan of the whole Groundhog Day concept and enjoy Run Lola Run for the same reason. There have also been episodes of The X-Files and Star Trek Next Generation dealing with the same concept.<br /><br />Video Quality 4.5/5<br />I detected slight aliasing on a couple of overhead shots of the city, but it's only there for a second or two. Colors look bright and clear, although red tint is slightly enhanced in facial shots. Detail is strong throughout, especially in close-ups. This is a pleasing transfer and exactly what you would expect from a recent release.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4.5/5<br />There's a lot going on in Source Code and the English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track handles everything well. The explosions carry real weight and the ambient effects, such as coffee spilling, are easy to detect. The dialogue is clear throughout and the score adds to the atmosphere of the movie.<br /><br />Special Features 2.5/5<br /><br />Audio Commentary with Director Duncan Jones, Writer James Ripley and Actor Jake Gyllenhaal.<br /><br />Access Source Code - A PiP feature including comments from cast and crew as well as trivia and expert comments on time travel.

This is a movie that can be enjoyed as an action thriller, but it could attract others due to the science fiction or romantic elements. For those that like to think, the science fiction elements definitely provide food for thought. I enjoyed Source Code in the theater and am happy to finally have it in my collection.

Jake Gyllenhaal is charming as ever, with great support from Michelle Monaghan and always reliable Vera Fermiga. Loads of suspense, a somewhat clever script, and fine editing had me from moment one. It's really fun stuff, with the entire cast rolling with the punches. My only argument is that the usually reliable Jeffrey Wright was sorely miscast (was Michael Caine busy?). Duncan Jones' film is quite enjoyable, loaded with nuance and verve. I liked it a lot. Gyllenhaal never fails to charm.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH.html">A2KWQ64TRHB3YH</a><br/><p>This is a very good film with a sci-fi story with an unusual plot and good acting. It raises many issues such as should we be able to experiment on humans when to do so would help mankind, what is time, can we change the past, how can we affect the future, can we hide information from the family of dead soldiers, and what is heroism. Viewers are pulled into the drama wandering what is going on, just as the hero of the film wonders. He is told some things, but not everything, but he figures it out. The film has a good surprise ending.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>The premise seems iffy, but I've seen worse: time travel becomes possible, but only a limited sort. Some few people can go back in time to the last eight minutes of another's life. Unfortunately, that includes the event that ended it, so it's hardly a pleasure cruise. Much to no one's surprise, the military takes this technology on as a counter-terrorism tool. It's too late to avert the disaster that already happened, but maybe it contains clues that will help prevent a bigger one. Eight minutes is hardly enough to get started, so Colter Stevens has to take the trip again and again, learning a little more each time, and dying again each time.<br /><br />The action plays well, and plays a little differently in each eight-minute trip (so he can make progress against the terrorist), right to the very end - which contains a pleasant flip. On the whole, this action movie acquits itself much better than lots I can name.<br /><br />So, what's my beef? The name. Obviously, some Lala-lander heard this cool techie term "source code". He didn't understand what it meant, so assumed that it had no meaning - leaving him free to make one up. I could do that too. Let's let the word "scriptwriter" refer to a South American turnip, and "director" be a children's playground toy. See how well that works? Heck, even a movie like Gattaca had the decency to create a new word when they created a new meaning. Outside that one bit of ridiculosity, I really did enjoy this one.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters</p></br><a href="../users/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA.html">A3NH7PYU4AD5GA</a><br/><p>Good sci-fi thriller about rewinding and doing it again...<br />Military hero finds himself in a strange mission in Chicago ..

The main character, a captain with possibly a sci fi fleet, keeps repeating the same event over and over involving a train which is blown up by a mad bomber.  Jake G plays the captain and he is quite good. He carries the whole movie, virtually every frame.<br /><br />This reminds me of the German film RUN LOLA RUN by Tom Twyker. He had Lola repeating the same event again and again with the end result of her ending up dead or her boyfriend or both.  She keeps redoing the sequence of events so that she can get them to both live. However, there is no "state" or army involved, no bombing event and no controlling force.  We never know what caused Lola to live this sequence again and again.  That was a 5 star film for me but Twyker did it first.  If you liked this movie, you will love the Twyker one.</p></br><a href="../users/A9NCQGVV5W8N0.html">A9NCQGVV5W8N0</a><br/><p>A decent cocktail of "Quantum Leap", "Groundhog Day" and "Twelve Monkeys" which sees Jake Gyllenhaal's s air-force pilot seconded into a covert military operation and forced to relive the final eight minutes of a commuter train bombing - via the expedient of a quantum simulation - in order to try and ascertain the identity of the bomber and avert a further terrorist catastrophe.<br /><br />It's a decent enough film although not quite the tour-de-force I was hoping for from "Moon" director Duncan Jones's second feature. Gyllenhaal makes a nicely tweaked lead in the Bruce-Willis-in-12 Monkeys tradition but the rest of the cast - with the exception of Vera Farmiga and a criminally underused Jeffrey Wright - are fairly forgettable.<br /><br />Definitely a case of "Close but no Cigar"; unfortunately not quite the classic it could have been with a little more polish.</p></br><a href="../users/AJD9EA658HCFW.html">AJD9EA658HCFW</a><br/><p>In hit television show "The X-Files" there is an episode titled "Monday". It's about a day that keeps happening over and over again, only differing in the small details of the day. In the end Mulder and Scully, (the stars of the show) end up dieing in a bank, due to a bomb explosion.<br /><br />The plot of "Source Code" is very similar to that of the "X-Files" episode "Monday". The story centers on Army helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal). The film begins with Stevens waking up on a train. He realizes, that he is in someone else's body. Within a few minutes, the train wakes up, where he regains conciseness in what is called a "Source Code". It is explained to him that the "Source Code" is a modern invention that allows one to experience the last eight minutes of a person's life. Stevens's objective is to find the bomb on the train.<br /><br />Overall, "Source Code" hooks you from the beginning and keeps your interest until the very end.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>If <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/080017948X">Groundhog Day</a> were written by Tom Clancy, David Baldacci or one of those guys that can craftily weave a tale of terrorism, you may have just ended up with Source Code. Instead of comedy with Bill Murray you get an action film with Jake Gyllenhaal that exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />Gyllenhaal connects to the Source Code through a device that allows him to experience the last eight minutes of a person's life. The movie explains that this is not necessarily time travel, but rather placing the user in an alternate time line, universe or something like that. Um...okay. Even though I've tried and failed to get my mind around the difference and what exactly it all means, I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie from start to finish. The movie keeps the action and suspense coming as Gyllenhaal time after time is thrown back in time...er, I mean, into an alternate whatever...in order to discover the location of a bomb aboard a train and more importantly identify who put it there and detonated it.<br /><br />Gyllenhaal practically is a one man show albeit with some rather small supporting moments from the other main characters. Source Code might just be Gyllenhaal's best performance to date (that I've seen). I guess some kudos should also go to Michelle Monaghan for playing her part so uniquely but also precisely in the succession of "on the train again "Groundhog Dayesque" sequences. And keep an eye out for Director Duncan Jones next project, because if it's a s good as Source Code or his last project called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002T9H2ME">Moon</a> it'll will be something worth waiting for and watching.<br /><br />Check Source Code out if you're looking for a good action flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A2809U2S14N0K1.html">A2809U2S14N0K1</a><br/><p>I found the story interesting. A guy has eight minutes repeatedly, in a train that some loony is blowing up. Looking at the plot I kept thinking what if some evil guy got hold of this machine, what could he do with it?<br /><br />I found the characters fascinating without being over the top. I did very much like the acting by Vera Farmiga, in particular.  I also liked Jake Gyllenhaal too.<br /><br />I confess, I did not like the ending. I did not make sense with the story and I think it would have been better not to have a typical Hollywood happy ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>SOURCE CODE, like the similarly themed ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is a love story in a sci-fi environment.  In both films, the hero does anything to protect the woman he loves.  In CODE, Jake Gylenhaal is a soldier who is assigned the task of preventing a terrorist attack on a commuter train in Chicago, which will result in the death of his girl friend, Michelle Monaghan.  This is accomplished by a secret government agency's "source code"---a device that gives Jake 8 minute time segments to find the bomb and the terrorist.<br />Director Duncan Jones elicits good performances from his leads, as well as Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright as the government agents controlling Jake.  Jones focuses on the people instead of producing an action film, and that's commendable.<br />SOURCE CODE is certainly a well-made film, but its predictable in its finale, and I found myself somewhat confused at the ending.  Since I don't want to spoil anything, I can't go into further detail, but I can't say SOURCE CODE is a great film, but it is enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/A3956O40ZZYFMY.html">A3956O40ZZYFMY</a><br/><p>Just a great movie. No real hidden political agenda (other than perhaps wringing every bit you can out of a servicemans enlistment). GREAT acting, plot, direction, editing.....a real surprise considering every other movie I have been unfortunate enough to see that was released this year.<br />I only regret that I didnt see it at the theaters....woulda been even better.....but the video is certainly worth at least renting.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>"Source Code" Duncan Jones' (you know David Bowie's son)latest science fiction thriller continues to make good on the promise of "Moon".<br /><br />While "Source Code" may sound like a more serious version of "Groundhog Day" (which may or may not have found inspiration in a short story by author Richard Lupoff that had the same premise as both films). While quite a good film the premise has its limitations and flaws; the character played by Michelle Monaghan isn't really well developed because we get to see so little of her in those eight minutes that are repeated like an endless loop. Still, the screenplay (and director Jones) do the best they can within the confines of the premise.<br /><br />The Blu-ray has a sharp, superb looking transfer. Audio sounds terrific throughout with nice action spread throughout the surround channels.<br /><br />Some people have complained about the ending--I liked it and found it refreshing after seeing too many films with somewhat downbeat endings although I did find it a bit disturbing--(SPOILERS BELOW):<br /><br />Our hero "chooses" to take over the life of the person he was temporarily "inhabiting". Was the result a combination of his memories/personality (much like in "Quantum Leap" and, interestingly, Scott Bakula plays our hero's dad on the phone)or did he obliterate the teacher he inhabited? There are some intersting questions left open at the conclusion of the film which has some disturbing consequences as well.<br /><br />(END OF SPOILERS)<br /><br />The Blu-ray has some nice special features including Commentary with Director Duncan Jones, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Writer Ben Ripley who pops in on occasion with some interesting insights as well. "Access: Source Code" has trivia, interviews and other bits of information that pops up almost like a picture-in-picture special feature.<br /><br />"Source Code" continues to demonstrate considerable talent from Jones and like the similiarly themed "Deja Vu" (which had a bit more flexibility with its premise), it's still a clever thriller that makes the most of its recycled premise.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>"Source Code" is a solid movie that will keep you engaged from beginning to end.  It has good acting, an interesting premise, and a plot that takes the entire running time to develop and thus makes you want to keep watching.  However, the film fails to rise to sci-fi classic status due to a failure to develop anything other than that interesting plot.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Source Code" follows the strange occurrences of Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal), a military soldier involved in a top-secret time-travel experiment.  Without saying any more and risk ruining the overall plot, suffice it to say that Stevens' primary mission is to stop an act of terrorism involving a bomb on a passenger train...no matter how many times it takes for him to get things right.<br /><br />The high points of this movie are the acting and the basic time-travel premise.  Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan turn in fine performances, as does Vera Farmiga as a conflicted military leader.  The plot is also catchy, taking from previous sci-fi material found in Star Trek TNG (Picard stopping the Enterprise from blowing up) and The X-Files (Mulder trying to stop the bank from exploding).<br /><br />Unfortunately, though, there is not a whole lot else in this movie to draw you in.  While the acting is indeed above average, the scripted characters and their interactions are nothing to write home about.  The main romantic duo that is supposed to carry the emotional base of the film just doesn't deliver the payoff in the end.<br /><br />Also, there comes a certain point in this movie where you find yourself watching just because you want to figure everything out (after the main climax has come to a close).  But (*SPOILER ALERT*): This is one of those movies that leaves the enduing up to your interpretation.  Some people like that, while others don't.  I guess I fall into the latter camp.  There's just so much left up to us as viewers to put into place that I would have preferred a bit more scripted closure.<br /><br />Thus, while this isn't an outright classic in my mind, it will at least entertain you for the 90+ minute duration, which is more than I can say for most movies these days.  Rent it cheaply somewhere, but you really don't need to own this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>The suspenseful initial sequence paves the way for this intriguing yarn. A decorated soldier, captain Colter stevens (Jake Guillenhaal) wakes up in the body of an unknown man; he's aware he's part of a mission with a goal: to find the bomber of a commuter train.<br /><br />"Source code" is a program that enables him to cross over into this man in the last 8 minutes of his life. So, the time is running and once he returns to search the clues the time is getting shorter.<br /><br />Dazzling and original script.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up inside the body of another man - get your mind out of the gutter, I mean "inside" like Quantum Leap - he must use his next eight minutes efficiently, because the train he's on is about to explode.  How does he know this?  Well, it turns out Stevens is part of the Source Code, a secret government program that can use "parabolic calculus" (whatever that is) to fold time and put him into another person's identity.  A little like D&eacute;j&agrave; vu with Denzel except their superior technology had a 4 day window and...actually, it's a LOT like D&eacute;j&agrave; vu.<br /><br />This borderline plagiarism would have been better off using the term "velluvial matrix" instead of "parabolic calculus" to explain the technology, because there are numerous problems with the time travel aspects of this film.  For instance, if there is an 8-minute window, and the concept behind the limitations is glossed over, why can't it be 8.5 minutes?  Or 9 minutes?  For something so unknown and unexplained it sure has a strict timeframe.  Second, some of the movements and discoveries while possessing Chicago school teacher Sean Fentress are simply impossible.  If Fentress never did it, he couldn't possibly have the memories capable of supporting Stevens' escapades throughout the train.  What I'm trying to say is, ignore the metaphysical connections because the science is pointless.  Nonetheless, the majority of this film is enjoyable.<br /><br />Gyllenhaal exudes anguish in most roles, which made him perfect for Stevens.  He's unaware, dazed, and rushes through each 8-minute iteration with the gusto of irritable bowel sufferer.  Vera Farmiga, who I normally enjoy, appears to be coasting through her role as the pseudoscience facilitator, giving Stevens helpful guidance along the way (e.g. look for bags, hold on I'm playing Minesweeper).  Although, a more military and scientific approach to finding someone responsible for crimes in a parallel plain of existence would be to simply kill half of the people.  If the event doesn't happen, the culprit is in the dead half.  If it happens, next time around kill half of the left overs.  Divide by two ad nauseum.  Even the terrorist portion doesn't make a ton of sense.  One of the most predictable misdirections in cinema history is created when a Hollywood political slant is subtly inserted.  Ultimately, however, the movie asks more questions than it answers, and an ambiguous ending furthers the confusion.<br /><br />It's fun, well made, and performed well.  But if you think too deeply, the brain shutoff valve is necessary.</p></br><a href="../users/AW1493ZQTQ2ET.html">AW1493ZQTQ2ET</a><br/><p>This is a rather odd little movie, but I think that's a big part of why I liked it.  The timespan covered by the movie is only a day, in fact focusing on only a few minutes of that day, and only a handful of people are involved, yet the movie is able to deftly explore a lot of important themes from a lot of angles via that small slice of life.  The acting is also very good, with nothing being overdone.  True, the alleged quantum physics used to make the plot possible is almost all nonsensical mumbo jumbo, but that's OK because the wise viewer will inherently be inclined to push the nonsense to the periphery and just run with the story.  Here are a few of the themes that stood out for me:<br /><br />- Life is "nonlinearly sensitive" in the sense that the smallest events can result in an entirely different life trajectory (the well-known "butterfly effect").<br /><br />- Superficial judgments of people often turn out to be completely wrong.<br /><br />- Life can end unexpectedly, so don't squander the time you have.  Make every day count.<br /><br />- Don't forget to tell the people you love that you love them.  Before it's too late ...<br /><br />- There may be some form of afterlife, but it could be quite different than what we imagine.<br /><br />Now do you see why I liked the movie?  Recommended if you're looking for something that has some depth.  In fact, when I finished the movie I thought it deserved four stars, but my further reflection on the movie upgraded it to a solid five stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>Director Duncan Jones (he's David Bowie's son) makes every second count in this sci-fi thriller that reminds us of the momentous import of being present in the moments of our life.

In this modern day sci-fi thriller, Jake Gyllenhaal plays a helicopter pilot shot down in Afghanistan; but he seems in a confusing state of mind.  In reality, scientific/medical technology has tapped into what is left of his brain (not much body left).  He is being used to travel back in time for 8 minute stretches.  He appears on a commuter train in Chicago just before a bomb goes off and kills everyone on board.  His mission is to stop it.  It takes him several attempts in consecutive 8 minute time frames.  Generally I'm not much for this "Groundhog Day" style of filmmaking but here Jones manages to change the environment enough that the story remains interesting.  Mid-movie the film becomes a traditional thriller as Colter (Jake G.) gets ever closer to the terrorist.  The ending is a bit of a cop-out, directed at mainstream filmgoers.  Some will hate it.  Overall, this is certainly satisfying entertainment in a spring full of popcorn worthy films.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Duncan Jones' "Source Code" is a taut sci-fi thriller, of which intriguing premise may remind us of a 1993 movie "Groundhog Day." Jake Gyllenhaal is Colter Stevens, a military helicopter pilot, who is given a near impossible task to find out the terrorist responsible for the recent train bombing in Chicago.<br /><br />Assuming the identity of a victim on the doomed train, Colter is sent back to "relive" the eight minutes before the bomb goes off. Like Bill Murray's hapless protagonist, Colter is forced to live the same eight minutes again and again by Jenkins (Vera Farmiga) and Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright), who are desperate to know who the terrorist is.<br /><br />Despite the time-loop concept the entire film is based on, director Duncan Jones employs a simple narrative style to focus the characters and their interactions. The result is a surprisingly emotional conclusion (like Jones' previous thriller "Moon"), in which the protagonist Colter has to face the inevitable.<br /><br />As an action thriller "Source Code" is fast-paced and slick, but perhaps some viewers might feel the idea of reliving the same eight minutes is underdeveloped. The reaction is understandable, but the film is not just about the process of detecting the terrorist (which is considerably suspenseful), but about the change that happens in the hero, who comes to see those strangers on the train as humans with feelings and stories. On that score the film delivers.</p></br></body></html>

It is also hilarious, biting and a work of satirical brilliance. Surprisingly, it is also good-hearted beneath its boorish exterior.<br /><br />Sacha Baron Cohen is a comic genius -- a man whose exquisitely planned bits of anarchy are strung together with an unexpected intelligence and sophistication. Plots lines interweave and resolve; comic elements are raised several times; characters develop, have conflicts and grow. All this in a film whose main attraction is that it contains scenes shot with unwitting actors. It's like viewing a beautiful watercolor painting, only to learn that it was composed in ten minutes by a man licking the canvas with a tongue colored by popsicles. The sheer talent required makes the feat even more impressive.<br /><br />"Borat" mostly avoids mere gross-out humor in favor of attacks on the pomposity of the upper classes and on and the hyper-politeness and inherent prickliness of many Americans. Cohen continually tests the boundaries of what we will tolerate, delighting in showing us the critical moments when our feelings overcome our breeding. And he loves to show us being as vile and racist as his lead. Hearing a Texan advise Borat to shave his mustache in order to look more Italian (ethnic but acceptable) than Muslim (unacceptably ethnic) was to witness the moronic underbelly of the national racial conversation. Watching a pastor run out when a hooker crashes a dinner party is to underline how far we have come from the One who invited prostitutes into his company.<br /><br />"Borat" is not for everyone. Its vulgarity is pretty extreme, though restrained enough to be believable. Watching Borat and a fat man wrestle in the nude (with sighting of male genitals) is not a sight most would sign up for. Still, it's amazing that even this scene fits in comfortably with the rest of the film. "Borat" surprises by taking its actors seriously while satirizing the rest of the planet's inhabitants. The only distraction was the meddlesome question of how much of the movie was staged, how much was completely acted and how much partially staged.<br /><br />Definitely a movie worth watching for those who appreciate jabs at anti-semites, rich Americans and the occasional swimming bear.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>The people who don't like this movie appear to be either disgusted by its crudity (have they seen any of the "Jackass" shows/movies?) or Borat's gleeful racism (which only exposes how ridiculous such prejudices are).<br /><br />Myself, I think this is an instant comedy classic.  I can't remember the last time I gasped and laughed so much at a single movie.  "Blazing Saddles"?  The acting, the writing and the wonderful timing of the opening scenes in Borat's village were hysterical.<br /><br />I thought Sacha Baron Cohen was a genius when I saw his Ali G show on HBO.  I'd resisted watching it for a long time because--like all the people in each segment of his show--I thought these idiots (Ali G, Borat, Bruno) were real.  Frankly, Cohen's characters aren't that far removed from what I've seen on MTV, Bravo and The E! Channel.<br /><br />Once I got the joke though, I was off and laughing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I49HL6XR62DI.html">A3I49HL6XR62DI</a><br/><p>I expected this to be the funniest film ever made. Well, it's not. However, it is original and Sacha Baron Cohen put forth a tour de force performance in "Borat". In my opinion the funniest parts of the film are those in which Cohen as Borat, interacts with people who have no idea who he is. His attempts to give men welcome kisses as he walks the streets of NY are hysterical. The driving lesson is outrageously funny as a real driving instructor, oblivious to the fact that Cohen is acting, tries to cope with Borat's attempts to drink booze while shouting obscenities at other drivers. You will fall down laughing. Another great segment is the ride in the RV with the sexist college frat boys. Cutting edge stuff. However, a lot of the other material falls flat. The rodeo is embarrassing. The nude wrestling scene could have used a good edit. Pamela Anderson obviously knew who Cohen was when he appeared at her "book signing" and it's just not spontaneous. Also -- what happened to the song, "Throw the J**s down the well so my country can be free?" I heard it prior to the film's release; it really made you think about the convenience anti-semitism provides to some folks and, at the same time, was terribly funny. Much better than the National Anthem sequence at the rodeo. Gone in the R-rated version. Also, warning - the scatological humor in "Borat" is just revolting. See the film -- Cohen is amazing. But I'm wondering where he can go from here. I hope his next film has a better editor and is a bit better crafted.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>For the reviewers that hated this movie, I truly expected to be among you.  Usually the silly comedy genre (Dumb & Dumber) just doesn't make me laugh.  Lily Tomlin & Steve Martin in "All of Me" made me laugh.  "Little Miss Sunshine" made me laugh.  I don't like disparaging humor.  In this film, Sacha Baron Cohen's anti-Jewish sentiment made me squeamish.  Then they started getting sillier like when instructing the artist to remember the horn, "It must be realistic."  By then I was laughing.  I wondered if there wasn't intended irony with the actor's last name.  Yes, this humor is very lowbrow.  It makes us ask the existential question, "Is it really okay to laugh at backward Eastern Europeans?"  But then, this is no more an accurate a representation of them than it is is of Americans.  Could a major export be pubic hair?  It's just comedy.  And I laughed SO hard, I had to sit back in my chair to not faint from laughter.  Unlike Beth Hartford Deroos' review, I did find the 300-pound naked fat man funny, particularly when they started running through the ballroom and wrestling onto the stage.  What absolute silly abandon!  Ken Davitian as Azamat does a great job.  He'll be in the "Get Smart 08" movie & has played on TV on "Six Feet Under," "Gilmore Girls" & "E.R."  Obviously, it wasn't a deep part, but it was very funny.  The DVD extras were hysterical.  Martha Stewart trying to teach Sacha how to make a bed with him getting in it and undressing.  As Martha folds the corners, he asks, "Where do you chain the womens?", as if this was a routine part of what happens in an American bed.  The scene in the animal shelter where Cohen wants to adopt a dog so he can "have sexy time" and the outrage on the animal shelter operator's face as she shoos him out of the facility is hysterical.  Cohen calling conservative black commentator Alan Keys "Chocolate face" is a humor that about only he could bring off.  "Borat" won the Best Picture Award of the American Film Institute.  Sacha Baron Cohen won Best Actor Awards from the Golden Globes, San Francisco Film Critics Circle & Utah Film Critics as well as the "Most Offensive Male Characters" Award by the Women Film Critics Circle.  This DVD did make me laugh.  It may affect you the same way!  Beware & enjoy at your own risk!</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>One wonders if the rodeo audience, for just one example, realized how ridiculous they were and how much they deserved the skewering that they didn't even know was satirical!  Is this film rude, crude, gross and outrageous? Yes, guilty on all counts.  But that's what makes it so effective.  Cohen exposes the dark, hypocritical side of the U.S. by being the earnestly obnoxious Borat.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I really liked this movie.  I had heard reviews from people that loved it, and some who hated it, so I watched this one expecting something decent, but not great.  This is a very un-PC movie.  To many it seems crude and vulgar, but it is much more than that.  A lot of the people who dislike this movie don't get things like South Park, which are over the top, but are really terrific satires.  Borat is a funny movie.  Sacha deserves the riches he made from this movie just for the nude wrestling scene alone.  I would never have done that in a million years.  I would rent this one if you are not sure if it is to your tastes.  For anyone else, this is a must buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>Borat is your everyday Kazahki news reporter. his sister is fourth best hooker, his neighboor is a jerk, he has a retarted brother, and he has the oldest mom in his village at 43 years of age. when he is assigned to make a documentary about the "US and A", what follows is a absolute hilarious romp through america that ranges from ediquette parties, gay parades, antique stores, nude wrestling, hyoer religious seminars and even the purchesing of a bear. after all of the reviews, i simply had to see this film and boy i was not dissapointed. the is definently one of the most funniest comedies i have seen in a while and it is the best raunchy comedy since American Pie. Cohen's character of Borat is simply comic genius, he can milk any laugh out of his character by the most simpliest of actions. not only that but the situations are practically golden, each one garunteed to get a laugh out of you. i have to say, this movie is definently not for everyone. there is tons of full frontal male nudity, some pretty fowl language, extremly racist jokes, and some downright low brow humor. but, if you dont care about all of that and just want to see the movie even more, then Borat is the one for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A30IP5D5DLHRPA.html">A30IP5D5DLHRPA</a><br/><p>First and foremost, if you are a parent of a child under 18 spare yourself the anguish and kicking yourself in the rear by not taking your kids to see this,  The same goes for everyone who thinks they'll be offended by it; chances are you will be offended.  In the theatre I saw Borat in, half the audience was laughing or on the floor while the more conservative audience (usually non-college student adults and older viewers) berated us for laughing at the racial and sexist jokes that clutter Borat.<br /><br />I will admit, Borat goes well over the top in both crude humor and imagry.  The one scene that comes to mind involves wrestling between a naked Borat and his overly obese producer... who is also naked and the fight tends to meander... a lot.  At this point I covered my eyes (while laughing hysterically) and kept demanding the movie Gods to make it stop.  The showing of the full-frontal nudity in males happens twice and while it is seemingly hysterical to myself and other Cohen fans, the general audience in the theatre just gagged or walked out.<br /><br />As for being whitty and satiracle, I found Borat to be hilarious.  I will not say American culture involves inherant violence and desires to kill all people of Iraq (as Borat more or less "proved" during the Rodeo scene), but he certainly brought out the worst in everyone he encountered.  The scene where he visits a gun shop to get "protection from Jews," the owner just stands there and changes the subject.  Many saw this as condoning the act when the guy was simply trying to be polite and not cause any trouble.<br /><br />Borat does a great job of taking social norms and taboos and throwing them right into the face of Americans.  For instance, he tries to be friendly on a subway only to be threatened by everyone he encounters and given the social norms in NY, this certainly makes it all the more funny.  Another social norm turned upside down is his treatment of women; when attending a feminist meeting he laughs at the feminists and brings up "research" that women's brains are smaller and keeps refering to one feminist as a guy.<br /><br />Pertaining to the candid-camera aspect and the controversy thereof; while I sympathize with the people he was extremely rude to such as the dining society... let's think about this.  If someone acting incredibly stupid shows up with a camera screw and is well-financed; he's either a friend of George Soros or it's a prank.  The fraternity guys claimed they were duped into thinking it was a documentary on the fraternity system and yet they didn't question why a guy from Kazachkstan was doing the filming and he was incredibly stupid.  Not to mention one has to know if he's being filmed and with technology today (particularly youtube etc) the film is going to be distributed.<br /><br />I loved the story; Borat is trying to find Pamela Anderson to make him his wife and it was obvious that one scene where he meets her is staged... but still funny.  Borat encounters many funny figures along the way and his usual antics such as loving women will make crude humor fans laugh.  One of Borat's obvious querps is his disdain for Jews (Cohen is a Jew himself) and the encounter with a Jewish couple at a bed and breakfast, who tried to be very sweet (although it seemed as though it was staged) and trigger the Blair-Witch Project scene that follows.<br /><br />Again, this is very crude humor appealing to college students, teenagers and Cohen fans like myself.  DO NOT SEE THIS is you think you will be offended or are easily offended.  Cannot stress this enough; which does force me to ding Borat to 4-stars because while I found Borat to be a five-star in my book, it does not appeal to the general audience.  This film was very entertaining for my friends and I to see and was worth the wait; we will get the DVD when it comes out as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>Guerilla improv often has a very short shelf life, but this one's still funny even after you know where it's going. In Borat, Sacha Baron Cohen has a character that's perfect for dragging hilarious material out of his unsuspecting subjects: naive and disarming on the surface, vulgar and profane beneath. He gets some really ripe stuff from the act this time around, with the lowlights of his American tour including a homophobic cowboy, a troupe of bigoted etiquette experts and an RV full of misogynist frat boys. The short, storyline-advancing scenes in between each unscripted segment are generally thin and bland, but Cohen's ad-libbed torments of the unprepared masses are clearly the movie's meat and potatoes and it wisely never strays far from that core.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>If you're Azamat-sized, forget about wearing the tee shirt!<br /><br />BORAT (2006) is easily the wackiest movie made in many a year.

I was one of only a dozen people in the theater on a Thursday afternoon and I'm the only one that laughed.  As a matter of fact, I fell on the floor.<br /><br />The film is simultaneously disgusting, racist, vulgar and idiotic.  Cohen makes fun of society [which is OK] and of people who befriended him [which isn't].  His character--although impossibly naive--is a one hundred percent revolving jerk capable of the lowest stunt.  It's difficult to not arrive at the conclusion that Cohen is a self-made man, capable of incredible self-promotion.<br /><br />So why did I love it?  I'm not sure I really want to know.  By the way, I've been to Kazahkstan and, as far as I know, there is nothing like the 'running of the Jew.'<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels--"Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>The free-running sequence in Casino Royale may be breathtaking, but it doesn't quite manage to provide the best fight scene of 2006 - that honor goes to the notorious one in Borat which, like Casino Royale, also involves testicles in an example of dedication by an actor that makes Christian Bale's weight loss in The Machinist look like phoning it in. You have to admire Cohen's cajones (which are on view in more ways than one) as he goes above and beyond the call of duty in his determination to stay in character no matter how hostile the environment he's helped to create. It's pretty easy to spot the faked or partialy faked sequences - the friendly Jewish couple who rent them a room, the children at the ice cream truck, the Pamela Anderson finale - and most of the victims that aren't faked are more than deserving of their fate (the racist rodeo impresario, the frat boys) or handle themselves well (the feminists). Even the villagers currently suing can't really have much of a case: the moment an extra agrees to put a d***o on as a prosthetic arm, it's pretty obvious they're not participating in a documentary. (Hell, they're not even real Kazaks, so it's not as if they're playing themselves!) And yes, it is very funny even if, like most comedies, it does run out of steam in the `serious' last act.<br /><br />Although there's been some criticism of the exras on the DVD, it's a decent enough package.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>Borat, a wild and sometimes almost completely out of control comedy, tells the fictional story of a news reporter named Borat Sagdiyev who travels from Kazakhstan to America to study American life. His government allegedly hopes to "benefit" from learning American ways. Of course, all this is merely a premise for a wacky comedy. We see Borat, played by Sacha Baron Cohen, traveling around the United States with his producer Azamat, making fun of them and sometimes driving them crazy with his Borat personality. The people he interviews, including a humor coach, feminists, a rodeo crowd and college students never knew that he was pulling their legs while they were making this film.<br /><br />It's stunning at times how much the Americans, including the humor coach and the people at a society dinner, put up with the rather crude and obnoxious Borat. Borat has many ways of making people less than comfortable and catch them off their guard. For example, he actually walks up to men on the New York City subway and tries to kiss them on the cheek! Ay! Of course, some people paid a high price for being "subjects" of the Borat experience; we are all familiar by now of the lawsuits that people filed against Sacha Cohen because they were humiliated by him on camera. They never knew they'd be seen across the world on movie screens. That could be embarrassing!<br /><br />Look also for a strong subplot: Borat sees Pamela Anderson on television and decides to run across the country, "interviewing" people, as he travels not just to understand Americans but also to trap Pamela Anderson into marrying him. Watch how this plays out when Borat eventually does meet Pamela!<br /><br />This movie is not for sensitive people who insist on political correctness. Borat Sagdiyev is certainly very much a Jew hater (although in real life Sacha Cohen is very religious Jew); and Borat's views on women, romance, handicapped people and African American people aren't exactly politically correct. In fact, Borat's beliefs are mostly downright racist. The trick, to make the movie work as a comedy, is to take these bigoted views and expose them (and the Americans who become ensnared in Borat's "little schemes") in a way that is sure to get a laugh. In essence, Borat tries to be a modern day "Archie Bunker" who also makes fun of (and provokes) people by trying to kiss them on the cheek when they have never even seen him before.<br /><br />The DVD comes with a plethora of deleted scenes; and the music "infomercial" was also very well done. We also get footage of Borat speaking to crowds, being interviewed on Late Night with Conen O'Brien and more!<br /><br />The cinematography is great in the scenes with Borat and Pamela Anderson; and I liked the scenes back in Kazakhstan when Borat is preparing to go to America.<br /><br />If you can take a joke, you will enjoy Borat. It's not for everyone; it's far from being politically correct but it should be OK once in a while to make fun of ourselves. After all, if Sacha Cohen, a devout Jew, can play the Jew-hating Borat, we ought to be able to laugh at ourselves, too. I will give this movie four stars and not five because there are some awfully controversial moments in the film; but I do recommend you see this. You ought to have a good laugh!</p></br><a href="../users/A3JXOXKWOIETIY.html">A3JXOXKWOIETIY</a><br/><p>Borat is, simply put, one of the funniest films of all time.  Sacha Cohen never steps out of character and what makes it funny is people believe he's real.  Borat's apparent ignorance is a setup to reveal the actual ignorance of those he encounters.  Though the producers got releases some are suing him for revealing how dumb they are.<br />  Borat basically mocks all his characters attributes: antisemitism, sexism, lack of etiquette, etc. An interesting trivia note is when Borat is speaking Kazakh, he's really speaking Hebrew with some Polish thrown in.  And his sidekick is speaking Armenian.  The village is actually in Romania (and they're getting in on the lawsuits too). High five!</p></br><a href="../users/ADB8XCKNSDY5Z.html">ADB8XCKNSDY5Z</a><br/><p>I think the main reason I hate ultra-offensive films is the film makers usually lack the talent to make any jokes besides offensive ones.  I think Borat is different though.  Although offensive jokes run consistently thoughout the movie, Borat shows the capability to pull off other kinds of humor as well.  In one scene he's shown riding in a car to go off to America, and when the camera zooms out, we see that the car is actually being pulled by a horse and buggy.  Then there's a scene where Borat sings his country's national anthem at a rodeo and upsets the entire patriotic audience.  And all through the movie Borat's broken English alone is enough to make me chuckle.<br /><br />When Borat isn't ultra-offensive, it switches to being just plain silly.  Its like a combination of a Mel Brook's movie with MTV's Jackass.<br /><br />Like I said, I usually can't find a way to enjoy comedies that advertise themselves as low-brow and crude, but I must admit I found Borat's total disregard for political correctness to be very refreshing.  I'm not saying I hope to see more movies like it, but I thought it was something to see.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>Since *Borat* is offensively hilarious, this film isn't for everyone.  As I was watching (and laughing), I can see where some people just might get turned off and get offended.  Otherwise, keep an open mind and just see what's so hilarious about Borat.<br /><br />Borat is a reporter in his country, Kazakhstan.  Borat and his producer, Azamat go to America to make a documentary on American culture.  This is where things go awry and hilarious.  Borat just cannot understand why people do not do certain things and is puzzled when they "bared their teeth".  For example, the 2 quick pecks on the cheeks when greeting is the traditional custom for Borat.  However, Americans resist that particular kind of greeting.<br /><br />Borat cracked me up when he meets diverse Americans, such as gays, Blacks, the upper class, prostitutes, Pamela Anderson and Jews.  What was even more hilarious was when Borat catches Azamat using the Pamela Anderson book as a stimulation for self-pleasure, Borat goes ballistic.  They wrestle in the nude and run out to a conference hall chasing.<br /><br />Now, *Borat* isn't funny every single seconds.  There were a couple that were worthy of a half-chuckle.  It did have a couple of short slow or dry moments.  Other than that, *Borat* was consistent with humor throughout.<br /><br />But, let me say it again, it is offensively funny.  So, you can either be silly and laugh or be serious and take offense.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>Like Jerry Seinfeld, Sasha Cohen goes straight for the laugh, and isn't concerned with any "message". Like Trey Parker and Matt Stone, co-creators of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00023P49C">South Park</a>, in "Borat...", many of the laughs fall into the category of toilet humor. This movie is my main exposure to Cohen. I saw a few episodes of his TV show prior to the movie, but just like watching a few episodes of South Park couldn't possibly prepare me for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000022TSW">South Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut</a>, I had no idea what I was in for.<br /><br />While Cohen isn't concerned about a "message", we see one immediately when he arrives in New York. His overeager attempts to greet New Yorkers with kisses are met with hysterical results. One man quite literally runs into and down the street to escape him; others threaten him with great bodily harm.<br /><br />Borat is supposedly in the "U.S. and A" to film a documentary for his country, Kazakhstan. While in his hotel room, he sees an episode of Baywatch, and falls in love with C.J. During a meeting with feminists - hysterical - he finds that she lives in Malibu, CA, and so decides to travel cross-country and ask Pamela Anderson to marry him.<br /><br />I won't go through the so-called plot, because the fun is in the spontaneity of the humor, but there is one incident I'd like to address.<br /><br />On the way to California, he schedules various stops to learn more about American culture. One such stop is at a rodeo in Roanoke, VA, where he angles his way into singing the national anthem - but he chooses to sing it with the words of his country's own anthem supplanting ours. Before singing, he espoused great support for the war on terror, and hoped that George Bush would drink the blood of every single [Iraqi]. This was met with thunderous applause. But then he started to sing, and asserted that Kazakhstan was the greatest country in the world. What struck me as odd here was that nobody started to boo until he declared that Kazakhstan was the #1 exporter of potassium, and that their potassium was the best. Honestly, I don't think anybody knew what they were booing about, other than someone was saying that a country other than theirs was #1. Again, Cohen wasn't going for a message, just a reaction, but we got one loud and clear. It was even clearer in the extras, where news coverage for that event was shown and the newscaster declared that Borat was "bashing" everything from the war to the Bush administration, which was a flat-out lie.<br /><br />Borat's trip took him through the South, and as one reviewer indicated, the South has been picked on considerably, and it would have been interesting to inspect the reactions of his radical behavior when applied to Midwesterners. I agree. That would have been an interesting approach. My gut tells me, though, that it wouldn't have been as funny.<br /><br />Borat's fear and hatred of the Jew was, to me, humorous, mainly because they were shown, during one of his "interviews," to be ill-founded and silly. Indeed, that particular scene, where he rented a room from an elderly Jewish couple, spoke loudly to the tumult in the Middle East, and the pointlessness of the hatred that is there so deeply ingrained.<br /><br />The Bonus Features weren't all I hoped them to be. Other than the enlightening Roanoke news broadcast, nothing that had been "censored" was as funny or pointed as what was in the film, so those were judicious cuts.<br /><br />Also, the extras were neither subtitled nor closed captioned. I don't understand why, when the movie grossed almost fifteen times what it cost to make (this virtually guaranteeing that the DVD will be successful), they couldn't spend the extra money and subtitle and/or caption the extras, as they did for the film itself. More and more producers of DVDs are doing this now, and for those of us who are hearing impaired, it makes a difference - the difference being that we might not buy a DVD if we don't think the special features/extras will be accessible to us.<br /><br />4? out of 5.</p></br><a href="../users/A22VNXHU6IZ5MT.html">A22VNXHU6IZ5MT</a><br/><p>Borat's great movie film is now on shiny DVD from Twentieth Century Fox!!!

It's freaking hilarious, in a terrible way. Sacha Baron Cohen is himself a Jew, but he makes fun of Jewish people in this film - a LOT. I had to stifle a laugh at the 'Running of the Jew' ceremony. Borat comes to America with the purpose of learning things and coming back to his country (hence the full title of this film)<br /><br />Borat falls in love with Pamela Anderson, so while he is on his trip, he attempts to take her as his bride. I have to say that my favorite scene is the one where he is at the rodeo and says he supports George W Bush's 'war of terror', and it is funny to see how Americans react to his Borat persona (not knowing he is merely an actor) and how he purposely mangles his 'understanding' of what they are telling him, such as when he is at that one woman's house and acts as if he does not know what the toilet is for, or when the other woman tries to teach him socialization skills such as telling jokes or how to excuse oneself.<br /><br />Is this movie in bad taste? Yeah! This movie is NOT for everyone, especially those easily offended. But otherwise it is freaking hilarious.</p></br><a href="../users/A3B87UZLPCF0HW.html">A3B87UZLPCF0HW</a><br/><p>Borat (Cohen) is a Kazakhstani TV personality sent to the US by his country - with a documentary crew in tow - on a fact-finding-mission about "the greatest country on earth". This is an acutely political piece of filmmaking that cleverly uses the guise of a dim-witted, if undeniably sweet character, to make some irrefutable points about the frame of mind of (some) American culture. That said, there's a point (in the film) where Borat wrestles his naked corpulent producer to the floor in a cringe-inducing scene that will have you both laughing and wincing in disbelief at the lengths that Cohen is willing to go to - and good God, laugh you will. This is simply one of the funniest films of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A16YCLRKOU0EV3.html">A16YCLRKOU0EV3</a><br/><p>I started watching Borat on the Ali G Show in college in 2005 when my suitemate introduced me to it, and I'm glad he did. This movie is very funny, if you have an open, unpolitically correct mind. The comedy in this movie, much like the comedy in South Park in my opinion, is in the style of All in the Family. The dvd box and the disc itself, as well as the on-screen menus and bonus materials are some of the most original, well thought-out designs I have ever seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROZK0G84RGMZ.html">A3ROZK0G84RGMZ</a><br/><p>I know this movie can be offensive to many people but it is only a movie.  The wrestling scene was a bit gross but at the same time really funny.  I loved how he literally tries to bag Pamela Anderson.

The funniest thing to me is how he was able to get some Americans to basically confess on how they felt about racism.  Great.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RFG9LI7JDILS.html">A2RFG9LI7JDILS</a><br/><p>Borat will surely divide its viewers.. it is not intended to be a pc film exploring cultural differences.. it is rather a complete violation of everything pc and brings out the worst in our international relations.. But it is endearing, very funny, and its explorations of the american psyche are spot on.. I found myself more often than not laughing at the American's who confront something different than themselves and bring out the worst stereotypes of Americana.. Borat is one of the most outrageous and totally relevant portrayals of international relations in the history of cinema.. Sacha baron cohen is hilarious in his absurd yet sympathetic portrayal of Borat.. a man completely out of place who always says the wrong things according to the other culture.. I found myself thinking as much as i was laughing..</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>I cannot remember the last time I laughed this hard and this much at a movie.  I might have to go all the way back to "Blazing Saddles," "Animal House," and "Airplane!"<br /><br />"Borat" is just that funny.<br /><br />There is so much that is so politcally incorrect, so outrageous...just so WRONG that I was gasping just before the biggest laughs.  The sold-out crowd I saw it with sounded like they would agree with me.<br /><br />Before you go, you have to know this: Borat isn't real.  He's one of three characters played by a brilliant British comedian named Sacha Baron Cohen, who's perfected each persona to appear totally believable.  His other two characters, the hopelessly white and moronic Ali G and the out-and-proud gay fashionista Bruno are absent here but Borat easily carries the show.  How Cohen doesn't break character in some situations is as much fun as watching the hapless people he's goofing on.<br /><br />The film has a loose feel to it but it contains a great eye for detail.  For example, pay attention to what's inside of Borat's producer's refrigerator when Borat catches up to him in L.A.<br /><br />I can't wait for the DVD to hopefully listen to a commentary from the filmmakers!<br /><br />Wildly, wildly funny.</p></br><a href="../users/A10X0JN8KTK89H.html">A10X0JN8KTK89H</a><br/><p>When I told the cashier that I'd like two tickets to Borat, he told me that if I could name the other two characters that Sacha Baron Cohen plays, my girlfriend and I could attend the film for free. I easily named Bruno and struggled to name the obvious, Ali G, and I got my free tickets.<br /><br />Let me begin by saying that I "get" this film. Cohen's anthropological project is not lost on me. I understand that Borat is a deconstructive mirror of American culture, but I do not understand how this is a new and funny idea. It's been done before in everything from Henry James' novel The American to Eddie Murphy's film "Coming to America."<br /><br />But I could forgive the unoriginality of the film if it could make me laugh. Sadly, the laughs were few. I spent most of my time wondering how the film was produced. It would have been better if there wasn't an attempt at an enduring plot, but rather an episodic plotting of American ignorance. And where the film could have delivered funny commentary (say, a consistent kind of reporting back to Kazakhstan about how Americans do this or that), it instead went for Jackass-style embarrassment of real people. Since this kind of "humor" clogs all contemporary media, I feel desensitized and therefore disinterested in it.<br /><br />But really, I shouldn't be reviewing this film. I'm not of the intended audience. It was made for those who had a political awakening at a younger age than me. What seems boring and immature to me might actually tickle the funny bone of my younger siblings and my students. That's what getting old does to you. It separates you from the younger generation. The decision is to either embrace or reject this inevitability.<br /><br />Perhaps some people will think I'm "looking too deeply" into this movie and expecting too much of it. If that's true, let's not pretend that this is the greatest comedy ever.<br /><br />In the end, I didn't get much out of this film. What I did learn is that I have finally started getting old. I'm glad that I can go to a movie like Borat and be unable to enjoy its mediocrity. Most importantly, I'm glad that I didn't waste $17 on tickets.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: Borat is the brainchild of Sacha Baron Cohen, an incredibly versatile and hilarious British comedian. Sacha Baron Cohen is a shape shifter, he has created characters and has basically become those characters, Ali G and Borat are his most famous. Borat is a spin-off movie from the Borat segments we saw in his TV show, Da Ali G Show. In the short segment we had Borat, a TV journalist from Kazakhstan who is basically trying to understand the ways of American culture. The film is the exact same premise except on a feature length scale.<br /><br />  In this mockumentary we have Borat who travels to the USA under a grant from his government in hopes of learning ways to benefit the lifestyle in his home country of Kazakhstan. In the midst of his journey he happens to watch an episode of Baywatch and now wants to go to California to marry Pamela Anderson. That's your basic structure, but that's not what makes this movie flat out hilarious.<br /><br />  What makes this movie extremely funny are the various social commentaries on our culture and religion worldwide. We travel from the east coast to the west coast experiencing all of the United States' diversity. In one scene he sits down with an instructor to teach him manners while eating with upper class white Americans, and he asks if it's appropriate to bring a guest. So, he does bring a guest, and that guest is a black hooker. I mean, just watching him making fun of ourselves is absolutely hilarious. In one hilarious scene he and his producer stay at a bed and breakfast at a home owned by an old Jewish couple. In the middle of the night he spots two cockroaches and they flip out because they think the Jews changed form and are trying to kill them. They stand there jumping and screaming while throwing money at the cockroaches. In another scene he sits down with feminists and asks if teaching women would be a problem since their brains are the size of a squirrel's. It's scenes like these that make Borat incredibly smart and probably the funniest movie you have seen in a while. The film pushes the limits in terms of shock value in some places, for example, a nude wrestling match between Borat and his manager in their hotel room when Borat catches him masturbating to a picture of Pamela Anderson. So, the film has two sides, it can be at times gross out humor but not without it's biting social satire.<br /><br />  Larry Charles directed this brilliant comedic movie, and while the meat of the film comes from Sacha Baron Cohen's writing you cannot deny the style. Shot as low budget as possible, Larry Charles has made this his own personal style. Some of the scenes are set up so perfectly that you have to credit Charles for the direction. When Borat first arrives in New York we suddenly hear Harry Nilsson's "Everybody's Talkin", and then we begin a little reference to Midnight Cowboy as we see Borat wandering New York City. Charles is best known for directing and working on Seinfeld and he stayed with Larry David to help develop and direct some episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm. Larry Charles also has written and directed episodes of Entourage and directed the Bob Dylan starring film, Masked & Anonymous.<br /><br />ACTING: Sacha Baron Cohen is the star of this movie, and he is the genius who plays Borat. What many people don't know is that Sacha Baron Cohen is British and he is Jewish. He is the most versitile comedian working today in my opinion. He can transform into anybody, hide his accent, and completely embody the persona. He is Ali G, Borat, he co-starred in Talladega Nights as Will Ferrel's French nemesis, and he was the voice of King Julyan in Madagascar. The character of Borat is not offensive to the people of Kazakhstan as many people are complaining, it's a serious jab at our intolerant culture. It doesn't show his ignorance, but rather the ignorance and intolerance of the American people. He created one of the funniest characters in film history.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Borat is an incredible social satire that will have you laughing till it hurts. It is not only a brilliant satire on our culture, but a crude and hilarious way of looking at it. The only problem with this movie is that it is in fact based on a segment that was only 10 minutes of the Da Ali G Show. In ways it does start to drag and it slows down in a few places, and that's mainly because it was originally developed for television. I said the same thing about Jackass Number Two a few months ago, and that's a problem that I don't think you can fix when translating a television concept to film. Overall this is a hilarious piece of comedic filmmaking. I like! It's very niiice!</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>We're entering rarified comic air here.  I don't think I'm remiss in mentioning Sacha Baron Cohen in the same breath as Chaplin, Keaton, Fields, or Sellers.  I haven't laughed so hard at a movie since "This is Spinal Tap" in 1984.  Not since Mel Brooks ("The Producers", "Blazing Saddles") have so many sacred cows been skewered in such an innocent and inoffensive way.  Credit Cohen's Borat, a gentle soul even when spouting out politically incorrect platitudes.  The beauty of this film is that you don't know what's scripted and what's improvised.  It's also a terrific piece of Americana.  I was surprised that political and religious conservatives like Bob Barr and Alan Keyes participated in this flick.  Who says Republicans don't have a sense of humor?  Kudos should also go to Pamela Anderson for allowing her persona to be lampooned.  I'm still crying Gypsy tears of joy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Having seen Clerks II, I thought that I had seen one of the more shocking movies around but it pales in comparison to this movie.  People with prudish attitudes should definitely stay home and even open minded people like myself will have some issues as to how far the movie will go.<br /><br />This movie seemed like a long joke that stretched so far that I started to get a headache after the first hour.  Borat (Cohen) seemed to want to do really outrageous thing to unsuspecting audiences (we have seen a lot of similar things on YouTube but some of the people in the film seem so generally nice that you feel especially bad with the jokes played on them especially the nice old couple that rent a bed and breakfast to Borat and his companion.<br /><br />Some of the scenes are gut-wrenchingly funny with a lot of "guy" humor especially when Borat says some shocking things to a bunch of women feminists.  Others cross the line especially some of the sexually explicit humor between Borat and his companion.<br /><br />I give this movie just under four stars but I preferred the previously mentioned Clerks II over it for overall humor (at least I did not get a headache from that film).</p></br><a href="../users/A38DQCCC64K4W.html">A38DQCCC64K4W</a><br/><p>I have decided to longer buy into the hype surrounding any movie. Yeah, right. But I was certainly expecting a few more BIG laughs from this movie...Still, it was pretty much constantly entertaining and downright shocking at times. Cohen def. has some nerve, kind of in that Tom Green 'I'm going to annoy the **** out of you' way. There were only two bits that weren't really all that funny to me(the bed and breakfast and the church...which was just scary!!!); All the deleted/additional footage was priceless, esp. the Dr., the dog pound, and the supermarket.  There are plenty of laughs all around, and like 'Bowling for Columbine', this movie allows alot of the 'real people' in it dig their own graves. And while some will find it offensive on numerous levels, I just found it really funny...'Hey, Vanilla Face...'...Classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>I enjoyed the movie besides the subtle hints hidden in there of perhaps a bias towards the U.S.? or maybe just in general? But the movie, The creator and character I don't think are trying to make a political statement, At least not in my belief. It is very funny and provoking, When He chases Pamela Anderson is a favorite scene, when he goes to a Pentecoastal Church is another(Could be offensive, not to me). When He arrives in the U.S. in the beginning ,in NYC and there is all these rude people, and when He talks to A Feminist group.I laughed out loud so bad. Very Enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>I must say that I'm a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen's "Da Ali G Show," and have enjoyed it for some time now.  Borat was fun to watch as he made his way through the United States looking for people to agitate, disgust, anger, etc.  However, in this film, "Borat:  Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Cohen runs the comedy well dry.  The scripted moments of this film were the weakest points in the movie.  **SPOILERS**  The incident with the bear, the bickering with his producer, and the lonely nights pining for Pamela Anderson were lukewarm at best.  I will say that the celebrated "naked fight" is very, very funny and is actually a highlight of the film.  However, Cohen is at his best when he confronts people in candid moments.  Be it at a church service, in the company of drunken frat boys, or at the dinner table, Cohen knows how to get funny (or at least brutally honest) responses from those he encounters.  These types of interactions show just how cruel, ignorant, kind, proud, forgiving, or oblivious people can be when put into certain situations.<br /><br />**End Spoilers**<br /><br />The film itself is okay, but it's nothing more than an overdone "Borat" skit that is best taken in small doses.  The DVD provides a few deleted scenes (some of the best being with the numerous police officers that Borat interacts with). It also includes a report on the Borat incident at a rodeo and a few other things that neither add to or take away from the film.<br /><br />If you're familiar with Borat already and enjoy his antics, consider this a strong rental.  If you're easily offended, don't bother.  Overall, "Borat" is a funny film that has equal parts hilarity and unfunny idiocy in it.  Even though I'm a fan of the TV series, I have no plans on purchasing this DVD.  Rent it before you buy it, folks.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>I guess I am shocked at how divisive this film seems to be--it's apparently another in the camp of "love it" or "hate it."  I was familiar with Sasha Baron Cohen and the Borat character from HBO's "Da Ali G Show".  While I was amused by this reprehensible, yet surprisingly innocent "Kazahstanian," I was skeptical about a full fledged big screen treatment.  Turning a comedy skit into a feature movie is a "iffy" proposition, at best.  Take a look at almost every Saturday Night Live adaptation for corroboration.  I'd have to say, then, that I was pleasantly surprised--Borat is a winner.<br /><br />Part scripted, partly hidden camera improv, partly "Jackass" tomfoolery--you're never quite sure what is to be believed in "Borat".  Some may feel that this limits the film's effectiveness as commentary, but I feel this enhances it's comedic appeal.  For there is such unbridled outrageousness to be had in "Borat," it's hard not to be caught up in the spirit.  I probably laughed more consistently within the framework of this spare 83 minute film than I have all year.  Some of it is dumb humor, to be sure--some of it was shock value or disbelief.<br /><br />But a large part of the humor comes from real life.  By playing the moronic, offensive imbecile--Cohen, and thus Borat, expose a cavalier prejudice, hypocrisy, and/or intolerance that exists within American culture.  Whether it's buying a gun to kill Jews, viewing women as sex objects to be violated, or supporting the genocide of our enemies--Borat always finds willing subjects to engage, people who in one way or another identify with these barbaric ideas.<br /><br />It's tempting to dismiss Borat as offensive nonsense, I know many have already stated that opinion.  It might also be tempting for others to embrace "Borat" as one of the more unapologetic and politically relevant films in quite some time.  But I don't think it is attempting anything quite so significant--and that, in truth, may be it's greatest success.  It walks the line unlike any other film in recent memory.  It has elicited much love from fans and major critics and much hatred from it's detractors.  This power to provoke such passion, such debate--be it feelings, emotions, thoughts, ideas--that is the film's crowning achievement.  This crazy little film is not only one of the year's funniest films, it has also become one of the year's most talked about.  Who can argue with that?  KGHarris, 11/06.</p></br><a href="../users/A29QA79VLQGHY6.html">A29QA79VLQGHY6</a><br/><p>The "Borat" party continues on DVD, with cool-stupid menus and lots of howlers in the "Surplus Material" section (that's extra features to most of us). A 20-minute video about the Borat character's U.S. promo tour  -- "Global Vistings and Television Shows for Purposes of Propaganda of Documentary" -- takes us to Cannes, with the infamous florescent thong incident that freaked out photo editors worldwide. From the Riviera, it's on to the talk-show circuit with appearances on Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno. Borat to Conan: "Your pubis, is it red? May I harvest it?" On Leno, Borat is ready for love as he mistakes Martha Stewart's bed-making demonstration for an invitation to sex. Stewart plays along, sort of.<br /><br />There's also a mock late-night TV music ad, with Borat singing to kids about their miseries and then covering "Born to Be Wild" from the stupid van. In the "Censored Footages" section of 8 clips, check out Borat's visit to an incredulous doctor -- "That means you had sex with your sister? ... No high 5" -- and a "Baywatch" spoof, "Sexy Drown Watch," with plenty of flab on display -- and another thong.<br /><br />It all adds up to a bonus half-hour with Borat, most of it as good as anything in the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>The public reaction to Borat speaks volumes about the very small amount of the US population that either doesn't have HBO or simply has never tuned into HBO's Da Ali G Show. Sacha Baron Cohen certainly didn't break new ground with the Borat character in the full-length feature film Borat. Indeed, the Borat character was a regular part of the Ali G show first popularized in the UK in 2000 and introduced to US viewers via HBO in 2004.<br /><br />So technically, all the hub-bub on the one side of the fence about Borat being a "racist" character or a misrepresentation of the Kazakhstan people is about 7 years late. And the suggestion on the other side of the fence that Borat is the funniest movie or character to come along in years is way overrated.<br /><br />The Borat character is funny. But what is funnier is watching the reaction to the character by the people that he is duping. Similarly, Cohen's Ali G character (a stereotypical hip-hop, British ghetto banger TV host) and the Bruno character (a stereotypical gay mannerismed TV host) have the same modus operandi....<br /><br />....And that modus operandi is Socratic irony. The characters deliberately feign ignorance in order to expose weakness in another's position. The result: most of the time hilarity. Whether it's Borat, Ali G or Bruno, the laughs are less to each character's behavior and more to the reaction of the person being duped and the commitment that people have to being politically correct so as not to question the ridiculous opinions and questions that Cohen's characters come up with. Cohen's characters' naive stupidity make his victims look equally stupid...Socratic irony. (The only victim that I ever saw that had enough intelligence to walk out of the situation without any regard to whether or not he was offending the Cohen character was Donald Trump.)<br /><br />Comparitively, if what we're really after here are public reactions to pranks and gags, you can get it all for free on YouTube. Cohen just has a better knack for executing his gags on VIPs. Therefore, to make a full length movie that developed the Borat character was a bit overkill for me. A movie that was similar to Da Ali G Show that mixed up the characters a bit would have kept the gags a bit more fresh.<br /><br />So do you want to see some funny pranks and gags that get a bit tired by the end of full length feature film about just the Borat character? Then the Borat movie is for you. Would you rather see it mixed up a bit between different characters? Then go with Da Ali G Show seasonal DVD releases. You want pranks and gags for free? Go to YouTube.<br /><br />But don't be fooled into being offended by any of the Cohen characters. They are not real; the man behind the mask really isn't that stupid. He's trying to make YOU look stupid. And if you take Cohen's characters seriously, you will indeed look stupid. You see? Socratic irony.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Finally had the opportunity to watch this and try to understand the hype surrounding this. After viewing this I thought it was silly to an extent regarding these culture clashes. The way the film is made is quite unorthodox because there are few actors and the main part of characters are people who really think they are talking to a reporter from Kazakhstan, just a candid camera. It is not surprising the huge controversy aroused as some of the people tricked into the 'documentary' have already sued Cohen.<br /><br />The film is funny and you will sure laugh at one stage or another. But there are many clich&eacute;s and stereotypes that Cohen uses as he wishes presenting a subjective vision of society. First of all, he could have used a fake country instead of Kazakhstan. It would not been so easy to trick some of the 'victims' into the 'movie film' but the comical effect would have been the same without offending anyone. Just like Molvania from the guys of the hilarious travel guides from Jetlag Travel (from which I think Cohen gets some of the inspiration).<br /><br />Then, there is the Jew issue. Although Borat (and all Kazakhstan according to the movie) is afraid of Jews and hates them profoundly, the film is not offensive to Jews at all. Jews pictured in the film are very nice people and the display of hatred against Jewish is so over stated and absurd that the irony is far from subtle. It cannot be any other way as Cohen is a Jew himself. However this is used as excuse: "Look, I'm laughing at me making jokes about Jews... now I am legitimated to laugh at anyone as I wish".<br /><br />The target of Cohen criticism is clear, the white Christian traditional southern people. He laughs at some evangelists in a church, high class republican southern people, drunk college guys, people attending a Rodeo... using sometimes hidden and sometime obvious insults, always protected by a camera and the "I am from another culture, you should be respectful". Some of the people pictured could be idiots but you can find idiots in every single community in the world. In fact, outside the USA the film has been taken as an opportunity to laugh at those type of Americans. The rhythm of the movie is a little uneven with some slow spots making the short 80 minutes of movie a little bit too much. However, as ridiculous as this movie is and the absurdity's of the situations described in Cohen acting is bit hilarious.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MQ672FYFNM7B.html">A3MQ672FYFNM7B</a><br/><p>The movie films Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen, of "Ali G." fame) as he takes a journey across America so he can document American culture. Along the way he falls in love with Pam Anderson and decides that he is destined to marry his dream-women. This is Borat's first time in the US so he isn't used to the customs or modern conveniences (such as a commode that flushes.)<br /><br />Along the way Borat meets, interviews, and speaks with various Americans. "Borat" is a thousand times more vulgar than any other adult-comedy and makes "South Park" look like a sweet Disney picture.<br /><br />I loved when Borat met with the feminist organization in NY and referred to one of the ladies as "pussycat." It was pure comedy and so offensive. I don't think this was scripted? Borat's sidekick, Azamat was also very funny. When Borat and Azamat had the nude wrestling match I thought I was going to wet my pants, I never laughed so hard.<br /><br />Borat takes cheap potshots and Jewish people, homosexual men, women, African American people, and the physically and emotionally handicapped. His ignorant comments are very offensive and make him sound extremely stupid. But as Borat speaks to various other Americans on his journey it is soon apparent that many Americans also share Borat's bigoted views. By the way, I found it very curious that the dinner party guests did not want to end the evening until Borat's African-American date arrived; but everything else he did before that was acceptable? Kind of sad and shocking and really says a lot...<br /><br />A lot of the scenes must have been scripted, staged, and rehearsed otherwise the movie never could have been made. But it was still funny to see Borat when he tried to "marry" Pam Anderson. I am shocked that it only got an R rating. It should at least be rated NC-17; I hate to imagine what was cut out to keep the R rating?</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>I like the premise.  A lot.  Plus Borat has a presence to him, and his mangled grammar strongly reflects what I've encountered in my 9 years in Asia.<br /><br />Like my title says, I don't think it's too vulgar.  I'm not easily offended.  Rather, I found its humor too predictable.  It set up these great situations and then got a little lazy in writing its way through them.  It's an independent film which, unlike Hollywood pablum, doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence.  But in the end I just didn't laugh much.<br /><br />This is much better than anything out of the Crocodile Dundee franchise, just to pick one example of "foreigner in U S of the A" comedies of the "fish out of water" variety.  But I quit after 30 or 40 minutes because it was just somehow missing something.  I can't quite say what.  Deep thought?  Follow-through?  A supporting cast that should've remained unemployees wannabes flipping burgers?  I have no cultural learnings to make benefit for you here.<br /><br />I really don't believe this is a two-star movie, by the way.  It is too glorious for that.  I really wanted to give it 2.5, but that's not an option here.  Then I saw it was averaging 3.5, which strikes me as a bit high, so I was cruel just to bring that average down.  Go ahead and shoot me.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LNWA25IM2DX.html">A9LNWA25IM2DX</a><br/><p>This irreverent film has little left to be said. This not usually my type of movie, the huge success of it was a clear consequence of all the propaganda and publicity surrounding it (which by the way is included as bonus material in this DVD release), I was a little reluctant to watch it at the movie theaters and I waited to watch it on DVD.<br /><br />Man I loved this film, the "innocence" of the character may be funny to a lot of people, but that is precisely what Sacha Baron Cohen used as a mean to get the worst of the people interacting with him, by provoking everyone surrounding him while pretending to be an innocent character from Kazakhstan, many of the more bizarre lines in this film come from the people around him and not Borat himself. This of course generated a lot of legal problems when the film was released that did nothing but give the movie more publicity than the one it already had.<br /><br />I still find it hard to believe he was able to leave the rodeo after insulting all the people in the place, there are lots of situations in which Borat does nothing but set the situation for people to show what they really think or believe (a police officer tells him to be ready to be stopped in his van lots of times because of his appearance, when Borat asks why, the officer simply replies "that's the way it is in America")<br /><br />I am not saying of course this is a serious film, it can be outrageous, disgusting, but funny in the end. This release contains deleted material that I believe could have been better that some things that were left in the film (check out the employee at the convenience store when he tries to explain that in America there can be many different types of cheese and also see Borat trying to buy a dog to have "sexy time" and then eat it)<br /><br />It also includes a section for "Global Propaganda" that contains interviews with Connan O Brien, Saturday night Live and Jay Leno with Martha Stewart (my personal favorite) It is also funny to see the way Borat thanks Michael Moore at a film festival when he tries to thank him. Another bonus material to be found is the bizarre music infomercial (advertising the music from Kazakhstan) released on the web to promote the film.<br /><br />Again, this may not be my regular type of film but it sure had me laughing, it is a film that beyond the jokes it might leave you with a couple things to think about.</p></br><a href="../users/A38YUU4J5Q4EJO.html">A38YUU4J5Q4EJO</a><br/><p>I LOVED Borat, and until I bought the DVD, I have never heard of his character.It is supposed to be Borat leaves his country (which I can't even pronounce!) to come to America and do a documentary, as the camera follows all his shenanigans :) .<br /><br />I just died laughing at so many parts. One that particularly cracked me up was when he tongue kisses a blonde woman, then says "This is my seester!"<br /><br />I also liked where Borat washed his clothes out in the park, in a pond.<br /><br />and where the bellhop was escorting Borat to his hotel room and he thought the elevator was it.I was ROLLING laughing. And where he kidnapped Pamela Anderson was TOO funny!<br /><br />I guess some of it was a little twisted, but so what?

Like Allen Funt, the originator of the format, Sacha Baron Cohen - along with his co-writers, Anthony Hines, Peter Baynham and Dan Mazer and director Larry Charles - generates laughs by tricking unsuspecting people into making complete and utter fools of themselves on camera.  Only, in this case, Cohen ventures much further into the realms of vulgarity and crudeness than Funt could ever have imagined or the television censors of his time would ever have permitted.<br /><br />As embodied by Cohen, Borat is a fictional character who hails from the very real West Asian country of Kazakhstan.  Convinced that he can learn some valuable lessons from the West that he can then bring back and share with his own people, Borat says goodbye to his impoverished village and heads to the United States to experience first hand the accoutrements of American culture.  The film chronicles the many absurd encounters he has with the folks he meets, mainly in Middle America, as he wends his way westward across the continent in search of his dream girl, Pamela Anderson.<br /><br />Some of the "skits" the filmmakers have come up with are sidesplitting and hilarious, some merely amusing, and others downright offensive (and all the funnier for being offensive, I might add).  The movie is least successful when it breaks away from the strict "Candid Camera" formula and shows us Borat on his own, out of sight of anyone not in on the joke, still carrying on the fiction.  In other words, the more "scripted" the movie appears, the less authentic it feels.  It should also be noted that there are times when one gets the impression that the people on whom the deception is being played are not quite as ignorant of the ruse as they appear to be, primarily because the placing of the camera often feels illogical if the spontaneity were truly real and genuine.  The one element that made "Candid Camera" utterly believable was that it was careful to keep the camera completely hidden throughout the course of the bit.  Here we wonder why it takes people so long to realize that they are indeed the target of a colossal joke (a prime example is when the old Jewish couple is walking up the stairs to bring food to the visiting Borat and the camera is filming them from OUTSIDE the room rather than sticking with Borat and his cohort within).<br /><br />However, what gives the movie its gravitas and heft, and takes it far beyond the level of mere "Jackass"-type gimmickry is how Cohen manages to use his shtick to expose the bigotry and xenophobia that lie just beneath the surface of a certain segment of American society.  Yet, one should also point out that quite a number of these people are actually more tolerant and indulgent of Borat's inane antics than one might except any reasonable person to be (or than we ourselves might be if we were put in a similar situation).  Indeed, there's a certain cruelty to the film in that the individuals and groups he is mocking are actually treating him rather nicely at times.  The audience is allowed to feel superior to the people on screen in a way that might not be entirely justified.  "Candid Camera" always seemed innocent and harmless in its intentions; "Borat" definitely does not, which is both the strength and the weakness of the film.<br /><br />Still, love him or loathe him, one cannot help but sit back and admire the sheer courage and chutzpah Cohen displays in placing himself in what are, in actuality, some pretty hairy situations.  That he isn't ridden out of town on a rail, the outraged citizenry chasing close behind him with torches ablaze, is, perhaps, the most astonishing aspect of the movie.  It's the bald-faced audacity with which Cohen throws himself into his work - rather than the quality of the individual sketches themselves - that ultimately makes "Borat" so much fun to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>Out of all the supposedly daring, controversial pictures released in 2006 - "The Da Vinci Code" and "V For Vendetta" being two prime examples - here is the movie event of the year, that one must-see picture.<br /><br />"Borat." Yes, "Borat."<br /><br />It is not the slickest comedy, and surely not the funniest, but its timely fusion of ingredients - satire, puns, visual gags, verbal gaffes, grossly-gross nudie stuff - make it irresistible and effective. Let's face it: It's the 10-car pileup on the Interstate. Our eyes are wide, our necks are wrenched and our mouths are slack in disbelief.<br /><br />Officially titled "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," the film stars comedian Sacha Baron Cohen as the title character, a wild-looking, anti-Semitic buffoon who plays up every stereotype Americans have about the Third World and Eastern Europe.<br /><br />Especially the anti-Semitism, which is revealed in an annual Kazak ritual so terrifically offensive (and creative) that writing about it won't do it justice. Several set pieces in "Borat" fall into that category. They work solely in the context of the character, not outside him. The best parts of the movie are the kind of satire you have to leave at the theater door.<br /><br />Doesn't mean you can't go back.<br /><br />So Borat is sent to New York City with his assistant (Ken Davitian) for cultural reports, and he finds a hostile city unwilling to receive his customary greeting of a kiss. His work there is unsuccessful. Then he sees Pamela Anderson on "Baywatch," finds out she lives in Malibu, Calif., and treks across the country in a used ice cream truck with his assistant. And a pet bear.<br /><br />He makes stops, mostly in the South, on his way to California. In scenes that Cohen and director Larry Charles insist are real, Borat appears on a morning show, sings at a rodeo and breaks up a Southern dining club by inviting an overweight black prostitute named Lunell.<br /><br />Some of "Borat" really is a crass reworking of "Candid Camera," as this fictional reporter, through innocent, Third World ignorance, forces his subjects to confront his skewed morality or cheerfully join him. A couple do, including some fraternity members in an RV. If there is one scene that feels forced in "Borat," it's this one. These guys seem to be cranking up their misogyny a few too many decibels.<br /><br />But one sequence is hilariously real, and that's a nude wrestling match between Cohen and Davitian, who is, well, a big man. The two are fighting WWE-style - except that it's no act - and I've never seen anything ? quite ? like ? it. It works on three levels: As a shock fest, a study in fight dynamics and a play on the homophobic Borat's complete willingness to engage in the grapple.<br /><br />What we're seeing is the id run amok, a movie that pretends as if children grew into full-size adults within the first 10 years of their lives, lacking an understanding in subversion and dark corners of the human heart. That's deep talk for what seems like such a goofy movie, but comedy occasionally does what drama cannot by throwing truth on a tilt to bring a shaded corner into light.<br /><br />We know that "Borat" is after more than cheap laughs because chunks of it just don't work. For me, anyway. The Pam Anderson material is dumb and overdone, but then, I'm no fan of Anderson. The dinner party sequence was lame, and Cohen is a little needlessly mean. If Jews want to accuse Cohen, who is Jewish, of self-hate, they could, but his use of anti-Semitism mostly highlights its stupidity.<br /><br />In other words, it's not searching, as most American comedies do, for a lowest common denominator, but erecting its own standard upon which to be judged. Cohen is a cagey, clever talent; while "Borat" is often improvised, the comedian had to map out these targets and create a humor that could survive the length of a feature film and not just a skit.<br /><br />"Borat" called its shot, slugged it into the cheap seats and just introduced us to the next year's No. 1 Halloween costume. Very nice, Mr. Cohen. Very nice.</p></br><a href="../users/AZQ7O73EAS3VI.html">AZQ7O73EAS3VI</a><br/><p>Disgusting as times. But hilarious.

His perspectives on the movie are unique to those from Kazakhstan and I hope you enjoy his review."<br /><br />(Note: the commentary by Dorat is in no way supported or condoned by me, and do not necessarily represent my world-view opinions.)<br /><br />Hello! Is Dorat here. Can you hear me? Hello? Oh. I guess this one way conversation, so I talk at you and you listen. Okay? Hello?<br /><br />Okay. I come speak today of movie, Borat. My second cousin from Kazakhstan make documentary and I love it. It touch my heart. I need say, too, that Borat's sister now #2 prostitute in all of Kazakhstan. Her trophy bigger now. She kiss like Juicy Fruit gum. You know Juicy Fruit? Hello? Okay.<br /><br />When Borat leave Kazakhstan, we worry he make us look stupid. But he did great job. His house nice place, too. He show how it stand almost straight and have room for beautiful cow in livingroom. I need say, too, there was rumor Borat's wife die. Is not so. She fall in love with man from Siberia and go north. She may be dead now but don't think so.<br /><br />Borat come to New York City on plane with Azamat, other Kazakhstan man who help Borat. It scary Americans on subway not kiss Borat back when he greet them. What wrong with America? Hello? You still listening? Okay. I worried, too, that Borat's Kazakhstan chicken get stomped on subway when she get out of bag. But not happen. Whew!<br /><br />It nice to see many good places to relieve bowels in America. The flowers in front of place called Trump Towers look pretty and open.<br /><br />On early visit, Borat meet man who teach him jokes in America. It strange, too, that Americans do not joke of retards. They so stupid, you must make jokes. And what happening with feminism. Is that right word? Hello? Okay. Borat speak true about womans smaller brains. Scientific study in Kazakhstan prove it. Don't know why those womans so upset with Borat for speaking true.<br /><br />Television in America look very nice. And is place where Borat fall in love with Pameela Anderson. I would sex her up as good as my own sister, too. But Borat should not have lie to Azamat about why they go to California. He should have said to Azamat, "We go California so I can sex up and marry Pameela."<br /><br />The trip across America is fun and scary. I love bear they get for protection. Too bad Azamat get so hungry later. Poor bear. At least they no have to clean up bear poop now. I not know, too, that American Jews no have horns. Is most scary! When Borat and Azamat stay at Jew home and not know until too late. Brrrr! I thought documentary turn into horror film. But I cheer when Borat and Azamat get out of Jew home safely in middle of night.<br /><br />When Azamat and Borat get into huge fight, was sad. But Azamat should not been ma$turbate to Pameela's picture. They wrestle and fight and run through hotel. Naked fighting is tough, because no clothes to hang on to. When Azamat pinned Borat to bed and make mustache smell like te$ticle$, was sad day for Borat.<br /><br />It good that they return to friends soon. I surprised, though, that Azamat dress like Hitler in California. Was he trying to hide?<br /><br />When Borat finally meet Pameela, it sadden me she not understand Kazakhstan way of marriage proposal. Kidnap is natural courting. I sure Borat should explain to Pameela if given opportunity.<br /><br />I happy to see Borat return home to Kazakhstan. He bring Luenell back with him, too, and she now #1 prostitute in all Kazakhstan. Borat sister now have competition.<br /><br />I take away from movie pride all Kazakhstan people now feel for country. We have representative in Borat. He a man who know the cultural learnings of America for make benefit glorious nation of Kazakhstan.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a creative and funny film that is simply not for everyone, as it contains material that is bound to offend someone. It is a quasi mockumentary, cinema verite style flick. Sasha Baron Cohen plays the character of Borat Sagdiyev, a journalist from the eastern European, third world country of Kazakhstan.<br /><br />Borat travels to the United States to learn American culture and film his experiences in order to bring back his new found knowledge to the masses in Kazakhstan. Along his journey, he interacts with real people with hilarious and eyebrow raising consequences. Borat always stays in character, which means he is alternately offensive and ignorant. Some of the Americans with whom he interacts raise a few eyebrows themselves.<br /><br />There are moments in the film are simply startling and totally outrageous. Others are even amazingly funny. There certainly are scenes in the film that rise to the level of social commentary, while others are simply sophomoric. Still, the film cannot help but entertain those who view the film without pre-conceived notions.  This is one film where I was either laughing my head off or staring at the screen open-mouthed, as I watched the misadventures of Borat in America.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COG8T9MPP3KA.html">A1COG8T9MPP3KA</a><br/><p>Agreed that Americans are very gullible to the next trend.

Annoying, overly serious convention attendees.<br /><br />The part where Borat shows a nude picture of his family to someone has been done in his TV show awhile back.

Sacha Baron Cohen definitely makes a lasting impression on viewers and has accumulated a strange cult following. Will you ever be the same after watching this movie - probably not.

It pokes fun, in some cases more extreme than others, for our benefit.  If we're paying 8 and in some cases even 10 dollars to see a movie, we expect to see something hilarious!<br /><br />Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is raunchy, crass, and often the character Borat is racist and sexist, and yet it always makes you laugh.  While many laughs comes from Borat's statements and questions, many more come from the responses of the real life people involved, such as the scene where Borat asks a car dealer if he has a car good for running down gypsies.<br /><br />If you think it's not okay to make fun of anyone, you'll hate this movie.  And if you do, please don't trash it mindlessly.  The racous laughter stemming from the theaters this plays in is proof enough of its success.<br /><br />Even if short on plot, this movie is undoubtedly one of the best comedies I've seen in too many years, best of 2006 among the likes of Clerks II.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>Yes, Borat is not politically correct, but who cares?  Borat is funny, in your face and most politically incorrect.<br /><br />Borat Sagdiyev is a television talking head from Kazakhstan played by the very clever Sacha Baron Cohen.  But, what the heck, everyone knows this!  You would have to have been living in a cave not to have at least heard of Borat.<br /><br />The basis of the film is a travelogue of the anarchic Borat travelling across America from east to west ostensibly to film a documentary but also to marry Pamela Anderson.  Along the way, Borat has a series of misadventures.  It is probably the more subtle of these that gave me the biggest laugh.  His thinking that a New York elevator was his hotel room was beautiful.  His shock that a woman could write a book while speaking with a group of feminists was absolutely priceless.  How so many people can be taken in by Borat is simply amazing.  Some people seem to take themselves just a little bit too seriously.<br /><br />If you're going to be offended by nudity or racist humour, steer clear of this film.  If you're willing to roll with the punches, you're in for a great 90 minutes!</p></br><a href="../users/A2K3L0DOPQQ697.html">A2K3L0DOPQQ697</a><br/><p>Borat proves to be the Python of our generation.<br /><br />I say this as a die-hard Monty Python fan - not because the humour is on the same level or follows the same guidelines (in fact, the common ground is here is that it follows no guidelines) - but because both comedy teams mask their sketches in a feature film, passing them off as a story when it becomes glaringly clear that the latter is an elaborate pretext under which to have outrageous, absurdist and side-splittingly fun in a series of genius gags.<br /><br />Yet for all of Borat's subsequent disorganisation and warped narrative, we are first served a gorgeously condensed introduction to our character in his village in Kazakhstan. This segment was possibly the biggest crowd-pleaser in my theatre and perhaps rightly so, for I would call it the film's goldmine in terms of sheer laugh-out-loud humour. Here we are introduced to Borat's sister ("She is number-four prostitute in whole of Kazakhstan."), whom he kisses on the mouth, his main interests (ping-pong, sunbathing and "watch ladies make toilet") as well as a wide variety of hilarious native Kazakhs. Undoubtedly the success of the introduction stems from a combination of novelty and a culture shock.<br /><br />Once the sprawling surge of Kazakhstani culture subsides, Borat flies to New York City to make a movie-film about the glorious US and A. The booming Russian ethnic score melts into Harry Nilsson's "Everybody's Talking' At Me" and the film gets ambitious: it spoofs Jon Voight's incongruous cowboy character walking down Manhattan in Midnight Cowboy (1969). This I found a pleasant surprise, but the referential spoofs end here and the rest is all Sasha Baron Cohen - and we couldn't be happier.<br /><br />The second half of Borat is arguably less compelling. It is hard to tell why, for the humour remains consistently good and there is an almost exponential stupidity with our Borat character as the sets out to go to California to marry Pamela Anderson. I would not go as far as to say the novelty "wears off", but we are a little more settled now and Borat has found his safe footing. Next, however, the film totally floors whatever safeness you may have with one of the most unspeakably graphic hotel room scenes I have ever seen. I won't give anything away, but rest assured that some viewers (*males*) will watch in horrified silence while others will literally cramp up from laughing so violently. I belong more to the latter category.<br /><br />As Borat travels through America, there is a wealth of juxtapositions to be found when he interacts with the people - members of the white house, television broadcasters, etiquette teachers, Christian fundamentalists and Jews - all offers layered hilarity and a consistent cloud of laughter kept hovering in the air. Sadly, it was not always directed toward Borat (but most of the time) but toward some truly idiotic hick Americans. When I was informed the film used many candid takes, I can only hope the unreasonably creepy Jesus convention was *not* one of them.<br /><br />In conclusion, "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006)" is a towering comedy achievement. It is apparent that Sasha Baron Cohen has done something truly cool here and has created an anti-semitic, misogynist and bigoted character that aptly embodies all racy taboos. As an actor he is unmistakably brave and uninhibited, which makes it easy for the film to lose itself in a tornado of gags, spoofs, bizarre one-liners and graphic jokes.

That is the question that is posed here in the film BORAT.I can absolutely see why people got upset at this film.It is appealing AND appalling.It is outrageous and it is sensitive.It is mockery and it is sadly the truth.BORAT is a mockumentary of the highest order where one sets out to spoof only to get the real scoop.People show their true colours, whether positive or negative when they think that they are in a "safe place" to do so.( I have learned this many times over the years...when people don't REALLY know who you are, and think you are like them,they will say what THEY really think...and yes,I am always "off-ended"...regain my balance...and then tell them what a fool they just made of themselves!My favorite is when an old man went on to me about the [...], only to find out that my sister is married to a man from Japan...GREAT!...all you ever have to do is not get upset, but simply tell the person the truth.God, do they back-peddle and get embarrassed...all without any argument!)<br />I understand that Kazakhstan considers Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat)_ public enemy # 1!

As far as being shocking, i was not personally offended or shocked.  Basically in movies you can have peoples' heads blown off and bodies torn to pieces and still get a Pg-13 rating, but if you say the F word or show a breast it gets an R rating.<br />As far as the really negative reviews it seems as if people are madd at the movie and wrote reviews with a thesaurus and dictionary on hand to incorporate every large word into their review.  I think the movie was actually smart and the show smarter basically it makes fun of the close minded, judgemental, conservative, and uptight people in our society, by making them look bad by using a ridiculous character to bring out their ugly side.  In a way it's theraputic to see these people that judge everyone to be mocked i mean these are the everyday people not putting on blinkers in traffic, talking on the cell phones while driving and driving bad, people that work a register and dont say thank you or welcome, that push their views on other people, people that basically are oblivious to their surroundings but are able to annoy everyone else, where maybe sometimes ignorance is bliss but in the show and in this movie we get to laugh at them instead of honking our horns at them.<br />Anyway all and all the movie is fun, and it's clever however if you haven't bought anything yet try the complete series.<br />Thanks for reading.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>I have finally seen Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, and it was very funny.  It is not, as some people have said, one of the greatest comedies ever made, nor it is particularly good satire.  Many scenes are really just done to provoke people, and this they do very well.  It's not very difficult to offend southerners (or anyone else for that matter) when you bring a prostitute to their house, or when you take a dump and bring it down in a bag, or the scene where Borat and his producer run through a hotel naked.  Most of the targets here are quite easy, and there really isn't any wit here at work.  With that said, there are many hilarious scenes, like the opening segment, the driving instructor (who is very funny himself), the weather man (who manages to upstage Borat), Borat's insulting of the feminists, and the camraderie Borat has with some bruthas in the hood.  It may be interesting to note that Borat's encounters with black people in the film are the most congenial, as they are very nice to him and treat him well.  His meetings with white people are usually hostile and confrontational.  This is a film worth seeing, but it's not a revolutionary comedy or anything of the sort.  We probably won't see another Borat film (at least not like this one), because everyone's in on the joke now.  Just a note--for those wishing to see/hear Borat's legendary ditty "Throw the Jew Down the Well" and see his "Jew Hunting" segment with a Texas hunter, those are NOT in this film.  They are part of the Ali G. show, where this character originated.  The film is worth seeing, definitely, but probably just once, maybe twice...</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>I find this an excruciatingly difficult film to rate and review.  In its short lifespan in the public realm it has tended to polarize viewers into a camp that has dramatically overestimated its virtues and one that absurdly exaggerates its vices.  I belong somewhere in between.  I have often been impressed with the talents of Sacha Baron Cohen in the past, but have not always been convinced that they were being employed in a worthy manner.  I have often laughed my head off at Ali G., only to ask myself later, "What was the point?"  I can't help but wonder if there is a degree of cynicism underlying his work.  Much of his work depends on fooling other people into thinking this utter idiot he is portraying, whether Ali G., Borat, or Br&uuml;no, really exists.  Many of the interviews we are shown end up incredibly truncated, no doubt because those he is interviewing either walk away or see through his act.  Only rarely does someone figure him out and then join in (check out his interview as Ali G. of Pat Buchanan, who quickly figures him out when he asks whether or not Saddam had BLT's and Pat says that in fact Saddam used BLT's on his own people).  Who are we supposed to laugh at in these films and sketches?  Are we ever laughing with anyone, or only at people?  Sometimes we are clearly laughing at Borat and with Cohen at his creation.  But very frequently we end up laughing with the people populating his movie.  I had a great deal of trouble enjoying these scenes in the movie.<br /><br />It doesn't help that we can't always figure out when everyone in the scene is in on what is happening.  For instance, it is quite clear that Pamela Anderson was perfectly aware she was in a movie at the movie's end.  And the woman playing the prostitute who agrees to marry him at the end of the film obviously had to be in on the joke.  But it isn't clear that the owner of the antique store was aware.  If the owner wasn't aware, the grief Borat's antics caused anguish that I simply find unpleasant and if he was aware, it was simply not a very funny scene.  There were too many such moments in the movie.<br /><br />Despite these misgivings, however, there is no question that Cohen does an astonishing job as Borat.  He is gifted on so many levels:  he is a tremendous physical comedian, somewhat reminiscent of another tall graduate of Cambridge University, John Cleese.  He also has an astonishing gift for improvisation both in scripted and unscripted scenes.  Anyone who has seen him as Ali G. knows how he can make amazing adjustments with those he is interacting with.  And his ability to stay in character is a ceaseless wonder.  He is also a genuinely funny man.  I actually regret that all too often he seems more intent on seeing how far he can take things rather than trying to be funny, but he still manages to be incredibly funny in scene after scene.<br /><br />But, once again, to what purpose?  Many have referred to this as social satire, but I can't acknowledge that it ascends to that level.  There is no doubt that he wants us to see America as being as strange as we find Borat and he certainly finds a number of incredibly quirky people.  The scene in which he has dinner with a dining club the South illustrates this perfectly.  Despite his absolutely bizarre behavior, he somehow manages to make the diners look as bizarre as he does.  In the end, it doesn't reach the genuinely satiric levels of Albert Brooks or Neil LaBute, but neither does it become something that merely mines the gross and bizarre for laughs like HAROLD AND KUMAR GO TO WHITE CASTLE.<br /><br />By the end of the film I had winced a lot, groaned a bit, and shook my head in discomfort, but I also laughed very, very hard on many occasions.  I don't know if this adds up to a recommendation or not, but I can honestly say that except for the Borat skits on DA ALI G. SHOW, you certainly haven't seen anything like this before.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>Unbelievable...and most refreshing. I cringed and laughed at the same time, because everything Borat said is something I've heard others say, regarding our own culture. I'm only wondering how much was staged, and how much real. I really liked Luenell, especially at the etiquette-heavy dinner party. Mr. Cohen is definitely a force to be reckoned with, and I applaud him for his effort. The DVD has lots of extra scenes that were cut, and will be as offensive as the film itself. I really enjoyed it a lot. The only way I could  see a sequel is if Borat took a northern route and met the mid-westerners like myself. We have foibles of our own, and the southerners have been picked on enough. I can't blab away plot-points, but this is truly a sweet, outrageous, crazy display of human nature; innate prejudices that everyone insists they don't have; longing for acceptance in an often alien world. And the consistancy of Mr. Cohen's performance is nothing short of amazing. He IS the new face of comedy in this millenium (Ali G, etc., accepted).</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>This movie is very funny, very crude, very racist, very sexist, and highly controversial, and I love every minute of it! Borat Sagdiyev leaves his nation of Kazakhstan and goes to America to film a documentary. He tries to drive a car, learns about feminism, sings the Kazakhstan national anthem at a rodeo full of rednecks, makes jokes about retarded people, tries to use proper manners during dinner and much more. When he sees Pamela Anderson on t.v. he travels to California to make her his wife. Another part I think is very funny is when Borat and his producer fight and run around naked in a hotel. I highly recommend BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>this film didn't move hardly at all. as a matter of fact this film for me was predictable within the first half hour of it going on. I don't find Cohen that funny on a whole. all the stereotype situations gets tired real fast. I watched his Ali G show and truth be told he pretty much does the same thing over&over on a whole.  had he truly challenged himself this might have been worth seeing instead of being predictable.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>There is no question that Sacha Baron Cohen is very, very smart. After all, he has contrived a way to get ordinary people to open their hearts and minds and let all their darkness and bigotry come spilling out. In the end, I think it's way more subtle and sophisticated than it seems. But that's only part of the story. Not all of the "victims" of Borat's pranks are unsympathetic. There are some who are well-meaning, altruistic, and sympathetic to this seemingly lovable idiot from an alien land where, he manages to convince them, men drink fermented horse urine and make women ride on the outside of buses. And that's the rub. Cohen is making sport of the good and bad, the innocent and racist, with one fat brush. Through his eyes, the world is populated with sloppy, boorish, ignorant, and sometimes really, really nice fools that smart people can make sport of relentlessly.<br /><br />After all, you'd have to be a complete idiot to believe that there is a country where gays wear blue hats, men brag about their sisters' oral sex skills, Jews are feared as shape-shifting demons, and no one knows how to use a toilet. The sad truth, however, is that a lot of decent, well-meaning and sympathetic types take Borat at face value -- not because of stupidity or idiocy -- but because they're perfect targets for a fraud. And that's exactly what Sacha Baron Cohen really is -- a good old-fashioned fraud. He's the embodiment of reality TV, the rich bachelor who isn't, the bold-faced lie.<br /><br />And, in the end, though I laughed and laughed and felt kind of sick about it afterwards, Cohen a pretty sick and talented schmuck. He's great a making fools of people, and, like the crowd on the school bus that laughed at the clumsy doofus with the banana-shaped head (I think every school bus has one), we laugh along with Cohen at how stupid, pathetic, and flawed people are. Laugh, laugh, laugh.<br /><br />I couldn't help but smile when I learned that, during his promotional blitz in character, a New Yorker who wasn't having any of it began to deliver a nice beating to Mr. Cohen. A cynical person might be saddened to learn that  someone broke it up.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BA72K4VK1UN1.html">A1BA72K4VK1UN1</a><br/><p>I'm not here to launch detailed film review as I normally do... and I definitely won't endeavor to point out the nonstop political incorrectness of this crazy film. I just chiefly wanted to convey that this is the most hilarious, side-splitting film I've ever seen in my half-Century (+) on the planet.<br /><br />THE STORY: Borat is a television commentator in Kazakhstan and he comes to America with his producer on a shoestring budget to document life here. He starts out in New York City but he quickly decides to head for California where his true Hollywood love is involved in the television industry (Baywatch). He encounters BIG TROUBLE (based upon his crude cultural background) everywhere he goes. It's that simple.<br /><br />My brother and I watched this movie yesterday and both of us laughed so hard from beginning to end that we had to watch the movie a second time to hear all the stuff we failed to attend during the first round from laughing too loudly. Neither of us is a contemporary film fan (both of us are retired cops) but we avow to make a big exception here. We had tears in our eyes and could barely catch our breath -- it's that funny.<br /><br />Is this 2006 film for everyone? Well no, the kiddies will have to be nudged out of the room (and out of earshot as well) and I assume that there are women, minorities, devout Christians, and other folks who are particularly sensitive to ethnic remarks and incendiary language who will abhor this one. I'd say that most people will come down on this movie firmly on one side or the other, with few on the fence.<br /><br />So, there's some pretty provocative nudity and the language is akin to what you might expect to hear from an angry and drunken Portuguese Stevedore. Heck, the antics themselves are pretty provocative. But in the end, if you don't care about all that stuff, it's just a movie, folks -- if you think that this presentation would offend you, just don't watch it.<br /><br />All others RUN... don't walk, RUN to the video store and rent or buy this crazy film! Family Dollar Stores are selling pre-viewed copies for six bucks and I've seen them elsewhere too. Make sure to get the widescreen version -- 84 minutes of rolling-on-the-floor-and-you-know-what-else.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>Well, first of all, I don't think there's any doubting that Sacha Baron Cohen is one of the most exceptional comedians of our day. His work here completely solidifies his reputation, and I look forward to him finding more work in Hollywood. Perhaps, like with Jim Carrey, they'll build entire films around his presence which would suit this fan just fine. It sounds like they're on the road to doing so as I read he's making a movie with Johnny Depp and I know he played a character in Talladega Nights. As for Borat, it is a magnificent film and I highly recommend it; although, it certainly isn't something that you can see over and over again. Its humor is all of the "embarrassment" variety so it goes down with the jolt and thrill of a shot of Maker's Mark. You do feel very bad for the average citizen who finds his or her self unintentionally lampooned. One aspect of it I loved in particular was the interaction between Borat and his producer. With the suit and short tie he was a 100 percent sterling imitation of a Soviet Union bureaucrat. Every time I saw that guy I laughed.  I must disagree over the anti-Semitism charges as Borat's posing as an anti-Semite created the situation in which people could then speak more freely. Borat is also fun to laugh at and laughing at him also allows for the satirization of those who hold the same offensive views. We know that Jews don't run our nation or are a force of evil so it's quite natural, and healthy, to laugh at those fools who think otherwise. There's no Jew baiting here in my opinion. All there is a masterful cinematographic achievement. I can't wait for the Bruno flick to come out.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Borat Sagdiyev (Cohen) is a TV reporter from Kazakhstan who embarks on a journey to America to make a documentary of the United States for his home country with the hope that they can learn from us.  His producet Azamat (Davitian) accompanies him on his journey.  Soon, in New York City, Borat discovers and falls in love with Pamela Anderson after watching "Baywatch".  He decides that he will not only film in New York, but all across the country, ending up in California where he hopes to meet the "virginal" Pamela Anderson.  Along the way, he learns how to drive, adopts a bear, gets humor lessons, sings at a rodeo, and wrestle with Azamat.<br /><br />This is easily the funniest movie I have seen this year.  Sacha Baron Cohen has created an idiot character that exposes the prejudices of the unsuspecting people he interacts with.  Most of what he says is cringeworthy, as he has the ability to say the exact wrong thing to the various people he runs into.  This movie is not for everyone, in fact there is surely something in this movie to offend everyone, but there is more to it than you might initially think.  I highly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>Borat is a marvel in the fields of mockumentaries and social experiments.  Sacha Baron Cohen's character of Borat, a Kazakh TV reporter, is not real, and yet he was able to fool a whole lot of people into thinking he was.  The film follows Borat (Cohen) and his producer Azamat (Ken Davitian) as they travel across the United States to film a documentary with the mission of observing American culture and using it to improve Kazakhstan.  The twist is that while Borat and Azamat are fictional characters, most everyone in the film are real people.<br /><br />The film starts and ends in Borat's home village in Kazakhstan, which is portrayed as a stereotypical ex-communist bloc country; it is very poor, cultural aspects that were cool in America 20 years ago are cool now, and there is a lot of intolerance (the town is extremely anti-Semitic).  All of the people in these scenes are actors, but once Borat gets to America, nearly (I would say 98%) all of the people interviewed for the documentary are real people who have no idea that Borat isn't real.<br /><br />While the stated purpose of Borat is to make Kazakhstan a better country, Cohen's mission statement was to show the sheer absurdity of American political correctness.  Though we live in a PC culture, racist, sexist, and other "-ist" ideas boil beneath the surface.  Borat is a character who says incredibly offensive things without realizing it.  His poor grasp on the English language and racist and sexist upbringing get him into trouble with a lot of people, such as when he tells a group of feminists that it is a proven fact that women have smaller brains than men.  The interesting thing is that most people don't object to any of the insensitive things that Borat says, while a few even agree with him and back up his claims.  For example, while attending a rodeo in the south, he tells the foreman that in his country, homosexuals are hanged.  The foreman responds by saying that people in America wish that they could do that here.<br /><br />The movie is incredibly offensive, but nothing that Borat says will offend you.  It is what we Americans do in response.  Borat is a fictional character, and while the things he says are silly, we know that Cohen doesn't mean them.  It is the responses of our fellow citizens that are shockingly offensive and hilarious.  Whether it be the Texan antique shop owner whose store is full of Confederate battle flags and pro-secession messages or the gun shop employee who answers Borats question of, "What gun would you reccomend to kill Jew?" with, "Probably a 9mm", it is a real eye-opener to see how some people in this country really think.<br /><br />It's amazing to think that the people who participated in this "documentary" didn't read their release forms closely enough to realize what was really going on when they signed them (though the frat boys from the end of the film are trying to sue due to feelings of being misled by the producers).  Still, I'm glad it worked out the way it did so that we could have this amazing film.</p></br><a href="../users/APIW11UEPKIC2.html">APIW11UEPKIC2</a><br/><p>I forgot to mention though, it is hilarious!  I am going to tell you right off the bat that if you are going to be offended by Borat kissing his sister, this is not for you.  If you are going to be offended by Borat showing everyone(and you)his son's junk, you will not want to see this.  Now if you are looking for a nude male fight scene that is a hundred times even more gross, then you have found your movie.<br /><br />You have probably seen 'Da Ali G Show' on HBO, you will know Borat as the idiot reporter from Kazakhstan.  We actually get to see his town for the first time I believe and it was a real treat.  Now the thing tha I really loved about thsi movie was that it didn't try to be a movie.  It does try to make a couple of plot points but doesn't worry about them.  It gives itself every oppurtunity possible to tell a joke.  This guy will truly do ANYTHING for a laugh.  Unlike the HBO show, a few parts do feel a bit staged.  This is not a bad thing because I promise you that the finale is totally orinigal and I did not expect it one bit.  And of course the nude fight scene cannot be missed.  It is hard to look at but once you have seen it, it is impossible to look away.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>I have seen my share of dumb, stupid, pointless obsene comedies, but this one certainly tops that list, or close to it. I found absolutely nothing funny about this film. Was it original, yea, sure, but that doesn't make it good. I mean, it was barely watchable. I applaud Sasha for attempting to play a role like this, and for staying in character, but really, this is a pretty awful movie. And worst of all is, I bet there are quite a few ignorant people out there that would think that how they portray Kazakstan in the film, is how it really is, which I must say, it is certainly not. I know how to take a joke every now and then, when it truly is funny, but this is a complete waste of time. Yes, it is interesting to note that there are quite a few clueless and dumb people in this country who would do or say anything if they got a chance to be in a 'movie' but it really isn't surprising. And then you get the people threatening to sue just cause they didn't think it would be seen here in America. Give me a break.</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>I went into this movie expecting the worst. I'm not a fan of the Ali G show, and I was sure that I would hate this movie and think the humor trite and overblown. I was wrong. Borat was so funny, I had to apologize to the friend who wanted to see it for my initial skepticism.  It's political satire at its very best and the best part of it is that this movie isn't afraid to laugh at itself.  Borat pokes fun at everyone, not just America.  In fact, my only problem with this movie was the nude male fight scene which, while hilarious, went on too long for my taste.  I'd definitely recommend this movie if you're in the mood for a laughing good time.</p></br><a href="../users/A13D1WTFEMS9VH.html">A13D1WTFEMS9VH</a><br/><p>I watched this movie with my 21-year old son, who enjoyed it a lot more than I did. While it is effective as a horror story about the profound ignorance and deep-seated prejudices of the Americans it caught 'Candid Camera'-style, this would have been better as a 5-minute skit on 'The Daily Show'. It relies far too much on toilet/gross-out bits for laughs, which in a very limited form appeals to the 15-year old in all of us. However, in a full-length movie it just doesn't cut it.<br /><br />I recall watching an episode of Tom Green's old TV show wherein he was suckling the mammary gland of some bovid (!) and asking the camera, "Is this comedy?"<br /><br />No, Tom, it isn't. And neither is 'Borat'.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen, "Madagascar", "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby") introduces us to his home town in Kazakhstan. He has been charged, by his government, with creating a documentary to improve the financial fortunes of his country. His journey? To travel to America and find out how he can make his country more like the United States and increase tourism and revenue. Arriving in New York, he greets people on the street like he would at home, trying to shake their hands and kiss them on both cheeks. Naturally, most of the people run away from him, swearing at the freak. His longtime producer, Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian), tries to keep him on track, but Borat begins watching American television in his hotel room and comes across a re-run of "Baywatch". Instantly, he becomes completely enamored of Pamela Anderson and decides he will travel to California and marry her. His producer is reluctant, but Borat convinces him and they set off on their journey after purchasing an old ice cream truck. Along the way, they meet many interesting people. But will he be able to find Pamela Anderson?<br /><br />"Borat", the brainchild of Sacha Baron Cohen, a British comedian, who seems to have a knack for creating truly off-center characters (he was the most memorable voice in "Madagascar" and the most memorable character in "Talladega Nights") and directed by Larry Charles (one of the writer/ producers involved in "Seinfeld", "Curb Your Enthusiasm" and other television projects), is a truly funny, truly outrageous and truly memorable film. It is not a perfect film, but it is extremely funny and extremely un-politically correct.<br /><br />From the moment Borat begins introducing us to the people of his village, we know we are in for a strange trip. He quickly exposes us to the character's feelings, philosophies, prejudices and phobias. We learn a little about his country and squirm in our seats. You just can't say the things he says in our country. It isn't politically correct and people would get upset. Will he fit in our country?<br /><br />What Cohen does here is almost brilliant. He is making fun of our preconceived notions of what Kazakhstan is like because we know little, if anything, about the country. We expect it to look like he is portraying it. He merely amplifies the image, making it more of a caricature. We expect them to use horses to pull their cars, to marry young and have many children and we expect them to carry a rooster in their luggage.<br /><br />Then he flies to New York.<br /><br />In New York, the humor continues, but it changes focus. We are laughing at Borat's exchanges with real people, but we are also laughing at their interactions with him. New Yorkers run from him, or swear at him, as soon as he approaches, trying to shake their hand or to kiss them on the cheek.<br /><br />All of these interactions appear to be completely improvised. The people he meets along the journey appear to be real "normal" people who have no idea who Borat really is. They seem to believe they are actually interacting with a reporter from a foreign country that many mistakenly refer to as Russia. If this is true, it is simply amazing to me many of these people are not threatening legal action. They don't come off well and that is what makes much of this humor all the more outstanding. And difficult to watch. As we are laughing at these statements, we are also uncomfortable because even though we know people can't still think this way, we know people still think this way.<br /><br />At a rodeo, he is invited to sing the National Anthem. Before hand, he tries to kiss a man he has just met on the cheeks. He says "Don't do that, that's what those guys who float around do", waving his hand at his wrist, and then makes a comment about them that is truly shocking. People really still believe these things? Amazing. Then, when he steps out to begin singing, he says "I support your war of terror". The audience cheers because no one seems to really hear what he is saying. They hear the words "war" and "terror" and immediately assume he is showing a sign of support. Later, after taking an etiquette class, he meets with a group of well-off Southerners for a formal dinner. They try to understand the cultural differences and build a bridge between the cultures, but when his guest arrives, everything turns for the worst.<br /><br />The brilliance of this comedy comes from the fact that we are, initially, laughing at his backwards little country, and all of their eccentricities, then we are laughing at our backwards little country and all of our eccentrics.<br /><br />Cohen does an amazing job of bringing this character to life. Early on, we realize Borat shares his countries fear of and hatred for people of Jewish ancestry. At no point does he ever back off or lessen this viewpoint. We watch the running of "the Jew" in his village. Later, he and his producer stop at a bed and breakfast and learn the couple who own it are Jewish. They shrink back in horror, but feel trapped. Throughout the film, Cohen maintains all of the characters eccentricities, creating an extremely consistent and believable character. This is all the more interesting and amazing when you consider how broad the comedy is. Generally, this type of character would laugh at himself, trying to clue us in to the joke, but he doesn't. He doesn't seem to realize there is a joke and as we continue to watch, we begin to think perhaps we are watching a documentary.<br /><br />"Borat" contains a lot of laughs, and they are consistent throughout. But there is a lot of truly adult stuff. I was surprised by the amount of full frontal male nudity. In one scene, Borat and his manager get into a fight and begin rolling around their hotel room, completely nude. Its a funny scene, but also sophomoric, because the fight degenerates into a bunch of homoerotic icons. The main purpose of the joke, besides the homoerotic references, seems to be the fact Borat's manager is extremely overweight. Not only are they guys, who fall into a bunch of sexual positions, but one guy is extremely fat. They are doing the two things many might find disgusting. Having sex with a man. And having sex with an overweight person. This was not the highlight of the film, but because it is shocking it is still funny.<br /><br />The film is technically brilliant. Every frame has been given a grainy image, to make it appear the Kazakh crew is using old video equipment, which is probably new to them. Every time a new person appears on screen, there is a title in Borat's native language with the American translation superimposed sloppily over the top. The film also resembles any propaganda film we have seen from another country, the same sort of phony staged introductions, the same awkward moments, the grainy footage looks like it has been played through ten too many bad elementary school projectors.<br /><br />In the area where I live, many matinee screenings sold out. I also saw that many evening shows were sold out very early on each day of the opening weekend. This rarely happens. When it does, it is usually an indication the film will have a monstrous opening weekend. Not really surprising because Cohen has been everywhere, always in character; "Saturday Night Live", "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" and his show has a cult following. This, and the universally glowing reviews, have apparently created a phenomenon. Amazingly, the film opened on about 900 screens, about half of a normal studio release. Fox has apparently seen the writing on the wall and already ordered a sequel.<br /><br />That is good news. High five.</p></br><a href="../users/A36RS7KTNOBROF.html">A36RS7KTNOBROF</a><br/><p>I never laught so hard in my LIFE."Borat" is fantastic.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>Although superficially this mockumentary would seem to be a satire of the people of Kazakhstan or the citizens of any country thereabouts, it is really a satire of America the beautiful.  Surprise!  It makes some good points and there are some laughs.  Mostly though I think the average viewer would be grossed out about half the time.  But that's okay.  For the average movie-goer or DVD watcher, getting grossed out is a lot better than being bored.<br /><br />Of course you might be bored too.  Personally I don't think I could watch the naked mock fight between Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitan) again.  I wasn't so much grossed out as made to feel that really I ought to find better ways to waste my time.<br /><br />Yes, we're bored in America.  Our neurons are sated with violence, pornography, and crude, boorish behavior toward our fellows (both real and on TV and in the movies).  Which is why, to be successful, people like Sacha Baron Cohen have to turn up the crude volume to get the old laugh-o-meter activated.  A glimpse of stocking used to be looked on as something shocking, now, heaven knows, anything goes.<br /><br />But should we care?  Yes, your preteen sons are going to find out who in the neighborhood has this DVD and they're going to watch it.  Will they be scarred for life?  Will they "get it"?  Will it make them uncouth?  Will they watch it more than half a dozen times?<br /><br />One of the interesting things about this movie is the publicity it got and the controversy it engendered.  Kazakhstan initially was greatly offended and protested loudly at this misrepresentation of its people.  But then they thought it over and realized that maybe this isn't necessarily such a bad thing.  In Hollywood any publicity is good.  They probably figured out that what is being made fun of is the average American's provincial attitude toward foreigners.  Cohen goes a long way toward proving that with the scene at the rodeo, for example, where his line, "We support your war of terror!" gets a nice round of applause.  And the guy who thinks that somebody with a moustache looks like a Muslim who looks like a terrorist adds a little to the impression that Americans, when they think about foreigners, think superficially.<br /><br />Actually, they don't do any real thinking.  Xenophobia reigns supreme in the heartland--but that would be the heartland of any country.  The frequent anti-Semitic shtick throughout was originally aimed at Europeans, I understand, who despite the embarrassment of the Holocaust are apparently as anti-Semitic as ever.  But Cohen, who is Jewish, makes fun of the antisemitism of Muslims as well as Westerners.  And he makes fun of the uneducated and uncouth as well as the superficially sophisticated--witness the scene at the Magnolia Fine Dining Society.<br /><br />Some people sued or threatened to sue.  Some guys from the University of South Carolina who were caught off guard and drunk, mouthed some stupidities for all of the world to hear.  They sued but lost the case, I understand.<br /><br />Larry Charles of TV's Seinfeld fame directed.  He achieved some tension with the simple plot of Borat coming to American and making a road trip across the land to California to meet and hopefully mate with Pamela Anderson.  That was pretty funny.  I understand that some of the scenes were staged and scripted, for example the book signing scene with Miss Anderson was at least partly staged.  But other scenes were play-as-you-go with Cohen just making up stuff and saying provocative things to get reactions from the innocents.  The scene in the bathroom with the woman from the Magnolia Fine Dining Society was pretty funny as she explains to Borat so seriously and so sincerely how to wipe himself.<br /><br />Bottom line here is, should you bother to watch?  My answer: maybe if you can stand the crudities, and maybe if you don't squirm at satire directed at Americans.  On the other hand, this is not in my opinion in the same league as some other famous comedic movies.  Certainly it is not nearly as good as Blazing Saddles (1974), which I was watching the other night.  Finally, the techniques used by Cohen and Charles are interesting in their own right because of the reaction of people who were taken in, or somewhat taken in, and so that they ended up saying some outrageous and embarrassing things.</p></br><a href="../users/ATQTE464YAZM1.html">ATQTE464YAZM1</a><br/><p>I saw this film a bit late. All my friends were about it, and it seemed like any where I went with them they were quoting it. This actually worried me somewhat - I've had experiences like this in the past and when I go see the movie I find it bad or simply overrated. Thankfully, when I saw this on DVD at last, it was not one of those films.<br /><br />"Borat" is a mockumentary centered around Borat, the Kazakh journalist from the Ali-G Show, who ventures to New York City to find out what Kazakhstan can learn from America. Catching a rerun of "Baywatch," Borat finds himself in love with Pamela Anderson and convinces his friend Azamat that they need to head to California for further research.<br /><br />The journey is essentially a series of Borat skits tied together by the Pamela Anderson storyline, in which Borat talks to real people pretending to be a serious journalist. Regardless of this thin plot it is still an enjoyable movie. Each scenario is just as funny as the last, and even though there was a lot of outcry over how this film portrayed Kazakhstan I think it makes fun of America just as much. While calling Sacha Cohen a genius might get me heckled, he is really clever in the way that he can call people out on the faults of their beliefs while playing dumb the whole time. For example, there's a scene where he's riding in an RV with some frat house guys who exclaim, "Remember, when you have sex with a girl, don't call her back!" Borat laughs and says, "Because you don't have her number, right?" The guys look at one another and stutter, and eventually mutter something along the lines of, "Well...you know, it's an honor thing, it's about respect." There's another scene where he's at a rodeo as a special guest and opens up with, "We support your war on terror!", gets applause, then starts saying more and more ridiculous stuff ("May George Bush drink the blood of every man, woman, and child in Iraq!") and STILL gets applause.<br /><br />Actually, truth be told, it may not be a movie for all tastes. There's a wrestling scene in the hotel room that will haunt your dreams and retard sleep for nights to come. This is another example of one of those films you either love or hate, and I happened to love it. So go ahead, check it out. Who knows, you may love it PAUSE not.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SCD2NYTIAQTY.html">A1SCD2NYTIAQTY</a><br/><p>"Borat" has caused so much comment to fly, not to mention paperwork for over-paid litigation lawyers, that one is almost obligated to see what all the fuss was about. In one of the first scenes, when Borat says "I like sex. It is nice.", you get a pretty good prelude to what is to follow.<br /><br />This is politically incorrect, tasteless, offensive and crass humour, to put it mildly. However, despite myself, I had to admit that Borat was pretty cool guy and that Cohen is a much braver man than I. Offending everyone from driving instructors, rodeo managers and audiences, passengers on trains, people in the street and etiquette coaches, "Borat" really is "in-your-face" humour.<br /><br />The basic premise of the movie is Borat's journey to the "US and A" to find out about that great country so as to improve his native Kazakhstan. Along the way, he falls in love and travels across the entire country to find the woman of his dreams. I still wonder that he didn't get pounded into a pulp by the security.<br /><br />Despite all the rudeness, I was very surprised that there was a bit of a sensitive side to the movie as well, between Borat and Luenell. It was a nice little message, if somewhat cliched and corny.<br /><br />In short, this movie is not for everyone. If sexual references and nudity are not your thing, I would avoid this one like the bubonic plague. Would I see it again? No. However, I am glad that I have seen it. Some parts were genuinely funny, and others made me cringe. However, it was good and fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>Sure, this movie was over the top in un-political correctness, and that was how it was supposed to be.  It is a fictional movie that made not only the main caracter look ignorant, but the folks around him.  This is filmed much like the Jackass films, ambush style greetings, shocking things with no clothing ect...  But this has the bashing of cultures tossed in, like the jewish community, and the extreme right christian fundamentals, which is garunteed to push buttons.  Overall, just not that great of a movie, great concept though, and if you shut your mind down for a minute and realize how rediculous some of the stuff in the movie is (like the fight between him and his friend, or the talk of his family) you have to chuckle once in a while.  If you must see this, just rent it, don't buy it until you know if you like it or not.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>I saw this movie after numerous friends saw it and recommended it to me.  By looking at its ratings on IMDB.com and other websites, it was supposed to be one of the funniest movies of 2006.  I was wholly disappointed.  As a minority, and someone who appreciates good racial and ethnic jokes, I found this movie's comedy to be a haphazard mix of derogatory, old-hat or just plain disgusting.  Much of the humor featured in this film has been included in older movies.  For example, the notion of Borat going from his backwards, ignorant, rural village in Kazakhstan to the wonders and cosmopolitanism of New York City is a storyline with too much play already.  The Beverly Hillbillies mastered this situational backdrop decades ago without the overt illusions to incest and personal violence made in this movie.  As another example, when Borat first enters his hotel room in NYC, he unknowingly refreshes himself with water from the toilet bowl.  A similar scene was used 20 years ago in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventures in regards to the Mongol warrior.  The underwear scenes were also quite old as similar tricks have been used in old SNL skits and the movie Zoolander.  Even the bungled singing of the National Anthem by Borat seems to reminisce Roseanna Barr's blasphemy in front of a MLB game in the early 1990s.<br /><br />There were occasional, original funny scenes, such as the bear Borat adopts to defend themselves.  But these few scenes were drowned out by the quantity of jokes in poor humor.  This DVD does not feature much beyond the movie, and the labels of the different special features were hard to comprehend.  All in all, a waste of time and money.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>Borat does have some funny moments (the best are actually in the outtakes) but it is SO non-PC it's humor and targets are completely obvious and act as expected.  Some scenes are obviously staged, others not but after the set-ups most people will know where they are headed so the comic payoff is often diminished.  Worth a look if you are in the mood, but not the comic masterpiece it is touted as being.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>I finally got to see "Borat" in its fourth week of release. I have to say, I enjoyed every minute. While the plot is a bit shallow, the film itself is frank, funny, and cruel. It definitely unmasks the hypocritical, shallow, and disgusting society we live in. Even when people know a camera is pointed to their face, they say and do things they know they will later regret. It makes for fascinating viewing, and a wonderful opportunity to laugh at the idiots trying to sue Cohen after signing releases allowing him to use the footage.<br /><br />This was the funniest movie I have seen in a long time...Cohen is hilarious...I can't wait for "Bruno" to come out next year!</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>Sacha Baron Cohen can be a talented performer, but "Borat" is 82 minutes of sheer hell masquerading as a satiric "mockumentary." The results are too vulgar and calculated to be funny. Since many critics admire this film, it's simply a matter of taste. However, do not confuse "Borat" with any form of comic genius.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>I've heard a lot about how this film made the average American look crass and dull-witted.<br /><br />But I'd like to say that foreigners of different countries have told me they felt "Borat" showed the U.S. in a very good light.<br /><br />They saw quickly that it was all a set up, yet they professed astonishment that Americans were so were reluctant to take offense, so willing to give Borat the benefit of the doubt, and so long-fused while he was tromping all over their sacred cows.  Eventually, of course, several of the "participants" lose patience, but only after having displayed a degree of charity and indulgence that would be virtually unheard-of in other cultures.<br /><br />I love my country!</p></br><a href="../users/A24KZBAAUTC83R.html">A24KZBAAUTC83R</a><br/><p>My wife and I have been watching this guy do this schtick since D ali G show has been on HBO.<br /><br />It is good to see a talented comedian make it big.

The film brings to the screen the Kazakh sex-starved journalist Borat, as he travels across the USA on an errand by his government to make a documentary on the American way of life.<br /><br />Sacha Baron Cohen takes the country by storm when he hits the American shores and starts picking on as many different groups as possible; from politicians, minorities and religious groups to feminists, hotel staff and innocent passerby's.<br /><br />His success lies in the indiscriminate use of caustic humor against everybody.<br /><br />However, unlike in Ali G Indahouse and the Da Ali G Show-The Complete First Season, a.k.a. Ali G in Da USAiii, where the setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful, in Borat it's just average and in some cases, such as the male nude "wrestling" scenes, just tasteless and sad.<br /><br />Nevertheless it does have its moments and at times it does make you hold your breath in anticipation or burst out laughing.<br /><br />In addition, the way Borat had that crowd going with "We support your war of terror!" was hilarious and he managed to get his message across very effectively.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's an ok movie if you're in a silly mood and/or are heavily intoxicated, and that's about it; no masterpiece here.</p></br><a href="../users/A3572FTYUQQW3P.html">A3572FTYUQQW3P</a><br/><p>Apparently I missed something in this film because I only found it mildly funny.  In fact the audience that attended the same performance I did hardly laughed at all and this included several college age boys sitting nearby.  While some people laughed (as did I) there were no knee slappers. However the reviewers here all think this was a hilarious film.  I was not offended by it, I just didn't think it was funny.<br /><br />Borat is basically a series of Saturday Night Live skits loosely connected, much like Talledaga Nights, but Talledaga was actually hilarious.  In this film, which is a pseudo documentary the people he encounters are not actors but he deliberately pushes them by his rude behavior to react.  His personal conduct is appalling and cannot be excused on the basis of cultural differences.  He accosts people in New York who react negatively to his attempts at friendliness.  Having personally been accosted by various nuts in large cities I didn't find their reactions to be unusual.  Watching a bunch of college boys get drunk and make fools of themselves didn't strike me as especially funny and the college kids sitting near me apparently didn't either because this skit didn't get any laughs and only a few chuckles.  Of course some of the anti-semitic skits were funny - especially the bed and breakfast scene but these never reached the level of Mel Brooks's treatment of the same subject. Nevertheless because of the few real laughs in this movie I gave it two stars, but overall I thought it was rather dull and as it wore on --  less and less funny. Plus there were scenes that I thought didn't especially fit other than to shock the audience.  The masturbation scenes were sort of funny but to what purpose? The same was true of the nude wrestling scene -- sort of funny but what was the point and how did it fit into a "documentary"?  I felt that making fun of people who were sincerely trying to help -- the Christian scene -- showed appalling bad manners and whose only purpose seemed to be to make fun of the people.  The same was true of the dinner party.  The Americans were trying to accomodate Borat but he continued to insult them until they reacted.  Would you have acted differently if a guest in your home was as rude and insulting?  Why was this supposed to be funny?  Not one laugh in the audience.  In fact this film is getting great reviews from Hollywood and New York but then those are the people who think the typical American is some sort of yahoo.<br /><br />I realize I am in the minority because I thought this film was only mildly funny and hardly worth the money.  I would say -- don't bother -- its all hype and not much comedic substance.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>"Borat," the twisted comedic gem from the brilliant, alert mind of Sacha Baron Cohen has one thing on its mind: exposing the ugly bigotry still festering just beneath America's seemingly welcoming, cosmopolitan society.  Cohen's antics as clueless and helplessly hateful Kazack reporter filming a documentary about America and searching to wed Pamela Anderson provide different Americans with an assumededly safe launching point to talk freely about their own prejudices.  Cohen also gets in a naked man-fight, rides around with a protective bear, makes out with his sister and pokes fun at the mentally challenged and the Jews, but that is all beside the point.  Cohen's real mission is to make America stare into it's own still prejudiced heart.  A rodeo cowboy in Georgia generalizes all Muslims as terrorists and admits he would want to see every single homosexual hanged, and the rodeo crowd cheers when Cohen says that George Bush should drink the blood of every man woman and child in Iraq.  A bunch of drunk frat boys casually admit slaves in America would be a good thing and that women are dumb, weak and should be subserviant to men, to say nothing of their attitudes toward the Jews.  These exchanges are funny, but in an almost frightening way.  America should have exorcised these flaws long ago, but they still stick around, waiting to rear their ugly head, if they are given the right catalyst of course.  Cohen's strategy does not always work, as some scenes (the dinner in a southern mansion, humor lessons with an Amerian instructor) sacrifice the social satire for more routine laughs about cultural divide.  But when the commentary kicks in, the implications for American society, now and in the future, are hard to ignore.</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>This slightly mean-spirited, vaguely intelligent movie contantly reaches in and drags laughter out of you, whether you want to give it up or not. Yes, it's at times hilarious, and yes, it's a LOT more crude than the innocent old Borat sketches used to be (ah, the simple fun of Borat's country-western rendition of "Throw The Jew Down The Well") and I'll admit parts of this movie left me open-mouthed with well-deserved shock, but it's every bit as disturbingly funny as it was promised to be, so it gives you your money's worth. And everything you've heard about it that you can't make yourself believe could possibly be true is actually probably 100% true, including a nihilistic pseudo-homoerotic nude wrestling match between Borat and his producer.<br /><br />Just in a side note, I really think the Pamela Anderson segment was totally rehearsed and staged, as were the part with the bear, and also the old Jewish couple who operated the bed and breakfast. The B&B part was a total setup, maybe even done in a set with actors, but most of the rest of this movie I do think rang impressively true. (Particularly those South Carolina frat boys!)<br /><br />Borat's movie is funny, and it does expose hypocrisies and shed light on some American cultural attitudes, but above all this is humor at its most unapologetically raw.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>Sacha Baron Cohen stars as Borat, a journalist from Kazakhstan who has come to America to make a documentary.  While in New York, he  sees "Baywatch" on TV and vows to go to California and marry Pamela Anderson.  Off he goes across the country, meeting (and insulting) various groups along the way, including Jews, Christians, animal lovers, rodeo fans, fine diners, a doctor, and just about anyone else you can imagine.  The vignettes were shot with real people, a la <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIWHEI">Candid Camera</a>, who react to the outrageous words and actions of the guileless and amazingly coarse Borat.<br /><br />I'd heard that this movie was outrageous and vulgar and insulting and it certainly is - and also the funniest movie I can remember seeing.  I laughed non-stop (while shaking my head in wonder at Borat's "victims":  Why would they sign releases to let their footage appear in the movie?).<br /><br />Borat never breaks character and keeps the joke up right to the end.  His pride in his run-down country is sweet and his innocence is what makes the movie work.  In the Extras, Borat appears on "The Tonight Show"...<br /><br />Jay Leno: "What do you say to people who say your movie is homophobic and anti-Semitic?"<br /><br />Borat:  "Thank you!"<br /><br />You'll either love it or think it's the most vulgar and offensive movie ever made.  I loved it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>A couple of years ago, in 2006, the biggest comedy hit was a film called Borat: Cultural Learnings Of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation Of Kazakhstan. The film grew out of a recurring character on a British television show, Da Ali G. Show, created by Jewish comedian Sacha Baron Cohen. I mention the man's religion because the film attacks Anti-Semitism in a brutally funny way, even as many dull-witted critics accuse the film of that bias. If so, then Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator was also Anti-Semitic, and his Monsieur Verdoux was a defense of mass murder. Cohen plays a Kazakh television reporter, Borat Sagdiyev, sent to America to make a documentary on American living for the benefit of his home nation. That's the setup, which starts in Borat's native village, and depicts his family and villagers as a bunch of creepy, incestuous morons who have an annual `Running Of The Jew' festival, ala the bulls at Pamplona, Spain. Of course, this is not because the film is satirizing that `reality,' but because it's picking up and throwing the Western preconceptions of that country back in the faces of that audience, much the same way that the film Everything Is Illuminated portrayed the Russian natives that are presented as idiots in that film in ways to tweak the preconceptions those people and customs engender in the West. In keeping with that, the supposed Kazakh language and `National Anthem' are, naturally, gibberish and folly.<br /><br />  The 84 minute film is a mockumentary that is not subtle in anything it does (ala Spinal Tap, or the Christopher Guest films), and is certainly not a work of genius, anymore than a Three Stooges short is, so why so many viewers and critics felt so negatively about the film, even as it broke box office records, shows that American stupidity is never to be underestimated, even though a similar ruckus ensued a few years earlier when the satiric tv cartoon South Park was made into a terrifically scalding movie. After the setup, the film is a series of blackout sketches that take Borat (in character) as he basically does a Candid Camera routine in front of gullible Americans who believe he is a legitimate Russian reporter. He has run ins with politicos like Alan Keyes and Bob Barr- the current Libertarian Party Presidential candidate, a gay pride parade, and a group of Feminazis. Cohen deliciously gets all to reveal their own darker and denser sides. All of the sketches are gotten through quickly, so the jokes never get old. The one thread in the film is that Borat's ugly wife dies, not long after Borat sees a Baywatch rerun, and falls in love with Pamela Anderson, whom he decides to sexually pursue crosscountry. Along with him, in a used ice cream truck they buy, is an unseen Kazakh cameraman and the film's producer, Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian). Other than Cohen and Davitian, the only other real actors in the film are Anderson, who makes a late cameo when Borat literally tries to bag her, and a black woman named Luenell, who plays a prostitute Borat ends up marrying.<br /><br />  Through it all, a number of misadventures occur, such as a test of etiquette lessons at a dinner party with Southern white racists, learning cultural tips from black gangstas in a Southern hood, rodeo goers who display an immense amount of cowboy xenophobia, slavery loving frat boys who pick Borat up in the desert and show him a Pamela Anderson porno tape to dispirit him, and Pentecostalists who speak in tongues, who teach him the power of Mr. Jesus. But, bar none, the funniest scene in the film comes when Borat leaves a hotel bathroom, and finds Azamat jerking off to his magazine. The two engage in a naked fight that ends up with Azamat pouncing on Borat in a 69 position, and the two of them running naked through the hotel, until tackled and asked to leave. This is what separates the two men, and sends Borat into the desert. Ultimately, he loses Pamela Anderson- whom he never had, and marries Luenell, and reports that life back in Kazakhstan is better than before.<br /><br />  The Twentieth Century Fox DVD has an old Soviet Era film feel to it, replete with badly worn looking film stock and Cyrillic lettering, and poor English translations of the gibberish Kazakh language. It has no audio commentary, but has some cool deleted scenes- although it was a good decision to excise them, especially a long and tedious (although funny) supermarket scene. There are also faux commercials- a music infomercial for the movie's soundtrack, a Kazakh Baywatch spoof called Sexydrownwatch, and an interesting compendium of the worldwide publicity tour for the film, including some late night tv appearances with Cohen in character as Borat.<br /><br />  One of the more interesting sidelights of researching this film was seeing how many people who appeared, and signed waivers, tried to sue the filmmakers (including director Larry Charles). This includes the nation of Kazakhstan and a group representing Gypsies, who claim their town was defamed and presented in a bad light, for Cohen shot that portion of the film in Romania. Yet, I was not astonished. Anytime someone shows up another party, be it intellectually or humorously (or, worst of all, both ways) there are bound to be immature and money-grubbing morons looking to make an unethical buck. That none of the rubes could figure out they were being put on bespeaks the utter idiocy of the American public at large. Now, it's hard to believe all the scenes were taken cold. After all, could the frat boys have had the Pamela Anderson video needed to despoil Borat's dream? Yes, she's a frat boy fantasy, but still, Occam's Razor says it was a setup, and indeed, all the alleged lawsuits may be just a part of the publicity campaign.<br /><br />  Nonetheless, the film suffers none the worse for it. And, if all the scenes were truly done cold, it bespeaks much of the goodness of the poorer and more disenfranchised members of society than the well off. Blue collar folk, the black gangstas, and the gay paraders, all embrace Borat with humor and grace, whereas the rich and white often scorn him. And, despite the harsh attacks on the film, culturally and socially, and despite there being nothing too deep here, Borat is a wonderful critique- nay, full out assault, on the asininity of Political Correctness, for, despite all the claimed offenses in the film, none of the people who appeared and filed lawsuits suffered anything they did not inflict themselves, due to their own arrogance and biases, and fully knowing they had signed proper legal releases, which is included at the film's credit's end.<br /><br />  Borat is the sort of a film that comes along at a certain moment and finds its niche (the hysteria and xenophobia rampant post-9/11), due to events in the real world, but will not long be remembered once the situations that made it so popular fade. Nonetheless, even in 50 years, there will still be a dozen or so scenes that will give one laughing pains the way a Moe, Larry, and Curly eye gouge still does. And that sort of staying power is still worth something in the ephemera of Hollywood these days.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>As they say, there's a sucker born every minute, but taking BORAT into account, multiply that equation by at least ten.  Comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, playing a reporter from Kazakhstan ostensibly in the States to make a documentary, pulls one sadistic prank after another, from sea to shining sea, on unsuspecting folks who subsequently become his comedic accomplices.  The result is funny; hilariously funny; side-splittingly funny.<br /><br />From BORAT's opening sequence from his (fictitious) village in Kazakhstan, this film serves notice that everyone, regardless of politically correct protection, is fair game.  And Cohen also sends the metaphorical shot across the bow that his brand of humor is not for the faint of heart, then promptly backs it up by such ostentatious behavior as bringing his own feces to a formal dinner gathering--to fighting and wrestling with his alleged manager (an obese and very hairy Ken Davitian) along the halls, lobby, and convention room of a packed hotel. . .both men as naked as the day they came into the world.  It's outrageous, it's often disgusting, it's raw and shocking--yet it's also hysterical, as Cohen's shocked bystanders swallow it all, hook, line, and sinker.<br /><br />That's right.  From chasing terrified New Yorkers in central Manhattan to wreaking havoc in a Texas antiques store, BORAT captures people in the act of being themselves.  Most of the time it's not pretty, but it's darn sure funny, and it's 100 percent revealing.  No doubt there's a group of frat youngsters who are still wishing Cohen's camera had never been turned on.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>With dialog like "When you go to America, don't do too much raping--only women," and "You mean the guy who put his rubber fist up my anus last night was a homosexual?" you know you're not watching Leave it to Beaver or even All in the Family. Borat is basically an outrageously funny and obscene take on the idea of the uncultured barbarian who goes to the "big city" to see how the other half lives, and has various outlandish adventures along the way. From the 5000 year old Sumerian story, The Epic of Gilgamesh to Midnight Cowboy and hundreds of other stories and films, this idea has provided an inexhaustible gold mine of funny and outrageous material for storytellers  for thousands of years. This movie is no different; it's just far more risque, outrageous, and possibly tasteless, but loses none of its comic potential for that. Cohen and his partner (can't recall his name) are both superb in their roles and the whole cast really looks like they're having a good time with this outlandish and uproarious farce that constantly looks like it's going to spin out of control. Even the most jaded movie fan should find something funny or just different in Borat.</p></br><a href="../users/A23L2BR07AOBG1.html">A23L2BR07AOBG1</a><br/><p>The movie isn't bad at all, however, it isn't the great piece of gold that a lot of people seem to think it is.  One reason it doesn't reach that greatness is because it combines the original concept of doing interviews with real people who are unaware it's a sham with footage of Borat with another actor, and these scenes don't really work for me in contrast with the rest of the film.  I just feel it works best in "Da Ali G Show." For me, the best part in the film was with the Frat boys in the RV who watch the DVD with him and his heart breaks, this is just classic.  Another thing that worked great for me on the DVD was the compilation of the press footage Borat got. His appearances on Jay Leno and Conan are worth the price of the DVD alone and show just how far this man will go with people who may, or may not know how far that is, something that was not as central in the movie. To me, that's the appeal of every character in "Da Ali G show" and especially Borat since he plays off the the whole culture clash sensitivity and shows just how sensitive people are and how much some people try to hide it, just for the sake of a foreigner. Overall, it's not a bad purchase, but I wouldn't recommend it for the movie, but for the extras (which are few, but good). I would also like to say that whoever does the music at the beginning and end of the film, is a comic genius, and hits exactly the right WRONG notes, if you know what I mean.

One of my IMDb friends who is known as an ironic and rather sarcastic critic, called "Borat" a brilliant satire. I don't know - maybe I just don't get the brilliance. I did laugh couple of times but mostly I was disgusted - it is not that brave or outrageous and as a movie it has next to none redeeming values. It hang somewhere in the middle and became simply boring which is the worst crime for a comedy and even with the running time only 84 minutes, "Borat" more than overstayed its welcome. Baron played it safe - it does not take too much courage right now to criticize Bush or to make Jewish jokes or to make fun of the poor uneducated village people. No matter what message he (Baron or Borat) is putting in/out there, the movie is sophomoric and the grandest case of the Emperor with No Clothes (in more way than one) I've witnessed. It is forgettable and mediocre at its best.</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>Okay, let me start with this statement....as other reviewers have said, this film is NOT FOR EVERYONE.  Its not politically correct but it is VERY FUNNY.<br /><br />Borat, a reporter from his native land of Kazakhstan, is sent, along with his short, chubby producer Azamat, to the U. S. to explore American culture.<br /><br />In New York, after watching an episode of "Baywatch", Borat falls for Pamela Anderson and decides he must cross the country to find his beloved lifeguard in California.  Along the way, Borat encounters dozens of people with various and hilarious outcomes.  Whether its a nude wrestling match between Azamat and Borat, hitching a ride with racist and sexist frat boys or his "marriage" attempt with Anderson, you are bound to bust a gut at some point in this film.<br /><br />Finally, don't skip on the deleted scenes.  There are six of them and all of them (other than the "cheese" one) are very funny too.  Borat's trip to the animal shelter and massage therapist are priceless.<br /><br />If you are easily offended, you many not want to view this film.  Otherwise, give it a go and you are guaranteed some laughs!</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>3 1/2 'Borat' in many ways is an original and very funny movie. Although we've seen hints of the clueless alien before ('Moscow on the Hudson,' 'Crocodile Dundee,' and, even to a lesser extent Jeff Bridges in 'Starman,') 'Borat' takes us through America with an alien-like never before. Using the male custom of greeting one another for a kiss, having different toiletry folkways, and regarding Jews with an ignorant fear, Borat and his producer sidekick, Azamat (Ken Davidian), set out for America in search of the best in us to take back to his country. His learning curve is necessary lesser than most visitors and immigrants, but it provides some very funny moments. One is found where he and Azamat wrestle naked in their hotel room (a match which goes into the hallways, the elevator and a hotel convention) after Borat catches him having a crude fascination with Pamela Anderson. (His infatuation with her is enough allure to take his trek from New York to California--not as originally planned.) (The Middle East has known to import 'Baywatch' like no other American product, regardless of their regard--or lack thereof--of women.) This enables our clueless Kazakhstanis a full view of America, and they meet all kinds, including a rodeo crowd, where are hero innocently provides a poor rendering of the National Anthem. They also meet gays, feminists, frat boys, an etiquette society, a Confederate antique store owner, etc. While much of the movie is crude, it is intensely funny. It has the power to offend some of the people some of the time, but it also has the power to make us all laugh most of the time. Even if the jokes are mostly on us.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>I saw Borat on Friday.

The humor - all dark - shouldn't be laughed at.  Anti-semitism shouldn't be funny.  Retard jokes clearly shouldn't be funny.  Naked men running around should be funny.  But somehow Sacha Baron Cohen makes us laugh at them.  In a post-modern twist, we laugh at the morons who enjoy this humor (us) as the same time we laugh at the movie.<br /><br />Perhaps because we tell ourselves, "He's making fun of the ignorant people" we allow ourselves to laugh with him.  Or is just we are always guessing is it real?  (And how did Newt Gingrich escape without a credit?)<br /><br />If you've got any sense of humor, you'll find yourself laughing.

It makes some serious, even grim points but does it in such a way you almost feel sympathy for the victims.  And then there is the vulgarity (some of which is very funny) which essentially takes away any chance of getting a message across.<br /><br />Yes, this country has many very backward people and as far as I know, none were coached to say what they did.  But is it really that entertaining to make fun of them?  Surprisingly, no.  Politicians, of course are fair game.<br /><br />I'll say one thing.  The guy has balls.

But, let tell you Borat is the funniest movie I have EVER seen. That is a pretty strong statement but it is true. I have never laughed harder or longer than I did during this film. You would have to see Borat at least 10 times to get all of the jokes, there are just too many funny parts. Just a few highlights include Borat and Azamat wrestling nude, Borat and Azamat staying at a bed and breakfast with Jews, Borat inviting a black overweight prostitute to a stuffy southern ministers house and of course the Pam Anderson bit. The thing that makes Borat so funny is that all of his victims are real people who are unaware that they are being exposed as either racist or sexist idiots. If Sacha Baron Cohen is not nominated for an Oscar and does not win for this role, then no comedic role will ever win an Oscar. Baron Cohen is absolutely flawless and relentless as the mock Kazack (sp?) reporter. The scene where Borat and Azamat crash a mortgage broker's seminar nude and start wrestling on the stage is the funniest thing I have ever seen in my life. There are only a handful of times in my life that I can say I've experienced a life-altering event but Borat is one of those moments. This movie will stay with me for the rest of my life. An absolute instant classic and the funniest movie ever made. Highest recommendation possible.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Borat rhymes with two things : boring forward and gore backward. To turn anything hateful and disgusting into some kind of humorous item from the big trick store round the corner is not easy, but is it funny? What's more I had already seen many of these gagging choking gags in other films, like drinking from the toilet bowl, bringing your feces in a plastic bag to the dinner table for disposal, inviting a street lady to a dinner party in a middle class home, and so many others. In fact Schwarzenegger is more effective in that line of the cultural gap or shock between the good old Soviet culture and the American lifestyle when he plays the KGB officer in New York running after a couple of Georgian Mafiosi in Red Heat if I remember well. It is amazing how they have, through advertising, made this film into what it is not, a funny film whereas it is sad and even very sad to see the thickness of disrespect they accumulate and pile up in order to produce a shocked little laugh. But one thing is sure. This film represent the spirit of its time, that end of an eight year tenure that was getting so stale and so full of carbon dioxide and poor in oxygen that we were dying like a poor fish thrown on the grassy bank of a dried up river. Even the bush of the rose garden were severely wilted and close to death from drought, the drought of the absence of basic honesty and truthful freedom of speech. But that does not save the film, that makes it an archeological testimony of the lurking death in which we were drowning then.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/A2CK0VXUDVXGMN.html">A2CK0VXUDVXGMN</a><br/><p>Clever idea, just not executed very well.  The money it made does not speak well for Americans intelligence.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>I first learned of the character of Borat this past summer from a friend of mine who introduced me to DA ALI G SHOW.  I found the sketches that I watched to be rather intriguing and at time quite humorous.  Sacha Baron Cohen's portrayal of the faux-Kazakhstanian journalist reminded me of another comedian that I greatly admired, Andy Kaufman.  Cohen's Borat most resembles Kaufman's Latka Gravas.  However, Borat is a far more crude and rude type of character than Latka ever was.<br /><br />The movie is "filmed" in a grainy, mockumentary style.  According to the plot of the film, Borat has been sent to America by the Kazakhstan government to observe the people in the United States and bring back what he learns so that the lives of the Kazakhstan people can be improved by the knowledge he brings back.  Borat and his comrade, Azamat Bagato (Ken Davitian) begin their journey in New York City.  Actually, they are supposed to stay in New York, but after Borat views an episode of Baywatch on television, he decides he has to go to California to find Pamela Anderson and marry her.  Thus begins a cross-country excursion that takes Borat through Georgia and Texas and eventually California.  Along the way, Borat stays at a bed & breakfast operated by an elderly Jewish couple, buys a black bear as a guard pet, befriends a prostitute, causes havoc at a local television station, scares children, and offends lots of people.<br /><br />There are moments when the movie is hilarious and there are other times when the film is quite insightful and becomes an almost brilliant dark satire into the American subconscious.  However, more often than not, BORAT (the movie not the character) is so pretentious that it is comes off as being a boring travelogue.  There are some very funny bits that occur (the chicken on the subway made me chuckle and I couldn't help but laugh when Borat was able to stand his ground against a group of feminists).  There are also some times when the movie shows part of the bigotry that many people in America have, such as when Borat asks a gun owner about which gun is best to kill a Jew, when Borat is talking with an older cowman before a rodeo, and when Borat goes on a drinking spree with some college students.  There are people in the United States who still harbor great hatred towards people of different races and religions.  But, we already knew that, didn't we.  In that sense, BORAT fails as a satire because it doesn't show the audience anything new that we didn't know and it doesn't offer any real suggestions in curing those problems.<br /><br />There are many moments in BORAT that are intended to be funny and illustrate how backward American people are, but instead of doing that the film illustrates just how kind and giving American people tend to be.  While lost in a "rough" area of Atlanta, Georgia Borat is befriended by a group of young black men (of course this is later used to show how racist certain hotel people are).  While eating dinner at the home of a genteel Southern family, the hosts go out of their way to accommodate Borat and make him feel welcome; they go far and above what people would consider acceptable, but they are good and kind people.  In a scene that is meant to be funny, Borat is embraced by a Pentecostal church--despite what one might believe about their religious practices, the people at the church embrace Borat.  Even the group of drunken college students, who spout various racist comments, befriend Borat and seek to comfort him during a trying time.<br /><br />There are also some moments in the movie that are intended to be funny, but have no humour value whatsoever.  For instance, there is a scene where Borat and Azamat get into an argument and begin wrestling naked in their hotel room.  The wrestling match continues throughout the hotel and into the stage of a conference room of the hotel where a dinner is being held.  Apparently, two naked men wrestling with each other in various sexually-suggestive positions is supposed to be laugh-out-loud hilarious.  I just didn't get it.  It was unnecessary and served no value whatsoever.<br /><br />Having seen some of the Borat skits from THE ALI G SHOW, having been intrigued by the preview for BORAT, and having heard so much of the hype, I was disappointed by BORAT the movie.  It wasn't the laugh-out-loud comedy I thought it was going to be and neither was it the full-blown dark satire I had heard that it was.  The film contains elements of both, but the movie doesn't live up to the hype.  The film most resembles a SNL movie, but the grainy film style makes it more entertaining than most of those.  Many high school and college students will love this film, but unless you're in those crowds are work with them, you probably won't find BORAT very entertaining at all.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MQQI4UYT9C11.html">A2MQQI4UYT9C11</a><br/><p>Most film adaptations of TV skits seem pretty thin, being that a 10-minute idea is being stretched to 90 or more minutes.  I've never seen Sasha Baron Cohen's "Ali-G" Show on HBO, but his "Borat" character from the show did just fine in his own feature-length movie.  Much of the tale of Borat's (a Kazakh journalist's cultural adventures in the US) was unscripted, as Americans he encountered were led to believe that Borat was a legitimate journalist. Their reactions are understandable in some cases (as when Borat tries to kiss male strangers in the "traditional" Kazakh way in the subway), and just plain scary in others (as when the gun dealer recommends "a gun to kill Jews with").  The result is almost non-stop hilarity, from the Running of the Jews in Borat's hometown in Kazakhstan, to his rendition of the Kazakh national anthem ("oh glorious exporter of potassium") at a Virginia rodeo.  The movie features a lot of bathroom humor (much of it very graphic), sex humor (all talk) and hairy male body humor (much of it just gross), but you never know what's coming next--somehow it's all both direct and subtle enough to keep you both grossed out and guessing.  I wondered if Pamela Anderson knew what was coming as Borat finally catches up to the fantasy love object he sees an episode of Baywatch on his hotel TV (the word is that she did).  Borat is the funniest movie I've seen this year, and ranks with "The Meaning of Life" on my list of funniest bad taste movies of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>If you could have told me last year that such an offensive film could get so much critical acclaim and even awards, golden globe best actor and an oscar for best screenplay, I would have committed to a psych hospital.  Well this one did, and now I am probably the crazy one for not likeing it.  It hard to predict which movies will spark controversy in the media, thing that attack religion such as passion of the christ, or movies such as brokeback mountain.  Now, this movie that clearly is a huge stereotype of Kazakhstanians and the way it beats on the jewish population, I don't remember nearly the press on this movie.  And men wrestling naked...please, warn people. I just don't care for this movie, it was offensive and rude.  And for those that think I "don't get it", no I get it, its suppose to be so over the top its funny, but some things just aren't, and this is one of them.  Luckily it's just a movie. The character of borat is shallow and sterotypical for theatric reasons.  Besides, wasn't this guy done by Andy Kaufmann back on the show Taxi?  Not original, just offensive in my book.  Again, another marker that the acadamy awards are off the base of the standard american public, either that or I missed the sinking ship that american public has taken to make this movie a semi-sucess.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>After seeing "Borat," I would have to say that Sacha Baron Cohen is one of the most brilliant and audacious comedians I've ever seen--a four-way cross between Peter Sellers, Andy Kaufman, Johnny Knoxville, and Rabelais. But I also have no desire, at least right now, to ever see this film again. As with some of Richard Pryor's concert films, "Borat" makes us laugh partly in pleasure, partly in shock, and partly in embarrassed recognition of the foibles of humankind, of which the entire audience, of course, are members. But whereas Pryor merely gave his observations of America as he saw it, Baron Cohen travels the U.S. disguised as Borat to record the less-than-enlightened opinions of the various Americans he meets. In the cases of elected officials, fundamentalist ministers and other self-styled official spokesmen for American culture, he hoists them fairly by their own petards (the homophobic rodeo manager is the best case in point). I was less comfortable, however, with his forays on the private citizens who were only trying to be nice to a foreigner, and who would have remained anonymous forever if it weren't for Baron Cohen/Borat. Even Borat's biggest fans have to admit he's an agent provocateur of grotesque proportions. Was it really necessary to regale formal dinner guests in Atlanta with bags of (putatively) his own feces? And while I don't really like being in the position of defending drunken frat boys, those particular drunken frat boys were trying to be kind to Borat, and all non-habitual drunks tend to say and do things in private that would never translate to their behavior when sober and in the outside world. There are parts of "Borat" that I consider as hilarious as anything ever put on film: I never thought anyone would beat Mel Brooks' evisceration of anti-Semitism in the "Springtime for Hitler" sequence of "The Producers," but darned if Baron Cohen doesn't do it with "The Running of the Jew." However, too much of the film in my opinion amounts to sabotage on innocent private citizens. My guess is that I would have made like the one New Yorker Borat approached, and run away from him. Now that I've seen his movie, I'd run twice as fast.</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>You've heard about it, you've read about it, and by now you have probably seen it. Borat, the legendaery comedy movie starring our friend from Eastern Europe, has two purposes, to shock you and make you laugh your heiny off.<br /><br />In all seriousness, only a Jewish person could get away with a movie like this. If a non-Jew were to make these kinds of jokes, this film would have probably never seen the light of day. Much like a black stand-up comedian who has a license to say N****r, Borat can show an oversized female Jewish character laying an egg and then having children crush it. This is the kind of humor that politicians in America have to ignore. If anyone caught them laughing, they would be run out of town.<br /><br />I am not saying this film will be funny for everyone. Maybe not everyone likes to see a 300 pound, hairy and disgustingly obese man run around naked, getting bit on the teet, and having his massive bare buttocks slamming down on another man's face, but when you buy a ticket on the Borat Express, you got to stay on for the ride until the end.<br /><br />To me this film was refreshing. In a time when over-budget, A-list star movies leave you wanting more, Borat looks and feels much more like an independent film. I sincerely hope that one of the reasons this film was made was to strike Hollywood where it hurt. You can make a funny and entertaining movie without a billion dollars. I only wish Borat had a derogatory joke about Steven Spielburg, but insulting the most successful director of all time (and a fellow Jew), well maybe even Borat has his limits.<br /><br />I personally enjoyed every part of this movie. Some of my favorite scenes were the yard sale ("I come to collect your tears Gypsy"), the hotel room wrestling match ("How dare you make hand party with my Pam-eel"), and of course the village ("Dis is my sister, she is number 4 prostitute in all Khakistan"). I am not running for office and I have no need to be PC. This movie made me laugh out loud several times. From the driving lesson to the dinner on Secede Ave. From the rodeo to the gun store ("What is best gun to kill a Jew?"). This film is something I can watch again and again.<br /><br />The only thing I did not understand was the Pamela Anderson part. Right before he turned on Baywatch, a scene of Married with Children came on. Peg Bundy (Katey Sagal) was the sexiest woman to ever sashay across a TV screen. If I was Borat I would have wnet after her in a heartbeat. But then again, seeing Pamela Anderson being wrestled around and being put in a bag was as entertaining as the rest of the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>This is definitely a comedy that lives completely on the edge. Its sheer audacity and fearlessness against public rebuke are admirable to some, repulsive to others. Except for a few groaners, this is one of the most hilariously observant films about global perceptions of the U.S. and an incisive, unguarded account of the prevailing social attitudes and cultural taboos in this country. In a compelling Andy Kaufman-like turn, Sacha Baron Cohen plays Borat Sagdiyev, a television commentator from Kazakhstan, here portrayed as the most backward of third-world countries. He has been assigned by his government to travel to the U.S. to make a documentary about American cultural mores.<br /><br />After introducing us to his country, Borat arrives in Manhattan accompanied by his hefty, worrisome producer Azamat. But there is a change of plan when Borat sets his sights on Pamela Anderson and sets out on a road trip across the country to meet her in L.A. There is no let-up of ridiculous sight gags and maddeningly funny asides during its quickly paced 82-minute running time. Unlike the Pamploma bulls, there is the "Running of the Jew" in which the Kazakh villagers attack a couple of giant, papier-m?ch&eacute; puppets, Mr. and Mrs. Jew, who in turn lays a giant egg which the local children beat furiously with sticks. Other scenes have Borat erroneously presuming that a hotel elevator is his room and being a semi-attentive student to amazingly tolerant instructors as he gets lessons on comedy, driving and etiquette.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, Cohen keeps upping the ante and yielding even more comic dividends  - a question to a gun store clerk about the best weapon to kill Jews answered without hesitation; a B&B owned by a kindly Jewish couple which turns into a scene from "The Blair Witch Project"; a conservative Southern dinner party that gets ugly when Borat invites an overweight black prostitute as his guest; an aging cowboy who lets his bigotry spew freely at the rodeo; a trio of frat boys from South Carolina who enthusiastically share their supremely sexist attitudes; and most infamously, an extended naked wrestling match between Borat and the grotesque Azamat that ends up in a convention of mortgage brokers. All these scenes expose a raw nerve which feels concurrently offensive, truthful and hilariously comic.<br /><br />Credit needs to go to director Larry Charles, who guides this venture with the same type of deadpan &eacute;lan he showed with HBO's "Curb Your Enthusiasm" and the screenplay by Cohen, Anthony Hines, Peter Baynham, and Dan Mazer, which lends a loose structure to what seems to be a series of staged scenes with all the non-actors. But above anything else, it's Cohen's major accomplishment that he can make Borat an anti-Semitic, sexist homophobe and still have him come across as an amiable, cheek-kissing fellow full of innocently executed malapropisms. I'm sure the easily offended will continue to express their disgust, but for the more adventurous, brace yourself for a comedy that will make you roar with laughter while giving you that unsettling feeling of recognition. It's quite a trick which Cohen and company pull off superbly.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198O25QYUPXE.html">A2198O25QYUPXE</a><br/><p>"Borat" is a mockumentary comedy of a fictional Kazakhstani journalist who is seeking cultural enlightenment for his country by visiting America.<br /><br />Sacha Baron Cohen stars as Borat and provides one of the most uproarious performances of his career to date.<br /><br />Some viewers may feel that this film heckles America but it is important to consider that Borat's naivety in displaying acceptable conduct is the essence of the narrative, and his own misguided philosophy makes a fool out of many people, yet he is the butt of all the joking even though he pulls some unwitting people in with him.<br /><br />This movie does have a lot of crude and politically incorrect humour, yet in a world that at times can be too sensitive for its own good, it's a different experience to see a film that breaks all the rules and throws the viewer off their seat with a combination of disbelief and laughter.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

Film the reactions, edit it, and you have a movie. The question for the viewer is whether it is a movie worth watching. I didn't think so. There is no wit involved here. You either think it is hilarious to mock a Christian religious service or you don't (I would like to see Cohen do the same to an Islamic religious meeting.

Hours of filming ordinary people just to select the minutes where they can be made to look foolish and using a shill to guide the conversation and provoke comments is part of show business. You can see this on the "Tonight" show, or in past "Sixty Minutes". Its not likely on a live broadcast.<br /><br />Does the word "borat" have a meaning that can't be said on broadcast media?

This is a brilliantly composed slice of comedic pie; a hilarious riot that is all the more hysterical thanks to the way in which it was created.<br /><br />Like I stated in my review title; the man that duped America got the last laugh.<br /><br />In `Borat', Cohen portrays the fictitious character of Borat Sagdiyev, a man living in Kazakhstan who ventures to the United States (The U.S. and A) to learn experiences to further benefit his own country.  He takes along with him a fat guy and a cameraman to help document his journey.  He arrives in New York, visits News Stations, gets an etiquette coach, talks to feminist groups and then falls in love with Pamela Anderson while watching Baywatch and sets of on a nationwide adventure to find her in California.  On his journey he buys a bear to protect his from Jews, nearly insights a riot at a rodeo, finds himself partying with frat boys and gays, winds up being healed by some holly-rollers and tries to kidnap Pamela Anderson by throwing a sack over her head while attending her book signing.<br /><br />The fact that 90% of this isn't staged is just amazing.<br /><br />`Borat' is not a film for all.  In fact, many will find this highly offensive.  Even if you love this film you will most likely still find it highly offensive, which is part of its charm.  Cohen is a revelation here.  If is no surprise that he was inches from an Oscar nomination here (he's the only actor to win any award that year outside of Whitaker and Gosling) and he really should have gotten one; he's that inspired in his comedic approach.  He never once breaks character, which would have been hard for anyone to do while carrying around a plastic bag full of your own feces while attending a dinner party.  I just wish I had been one of the people on the subway the day he let that chicken loose.<br /><br />This movie is brilliant.</p></br><a href="../users/A20TJ5P97W5MS1.html">A20TJ5P97W5MS1</a><br/><p>As a culture what do we really know about ourselves? Borat is a well made, intelligent, satire mockumentary. This film was written, produced by, and stars the English comedian Sacha Baron Cohen. Cohen plays a journalist named Borat who is traveling through the United States from Kazakhstan. Borat travels through the American country side and interacts with what appear to be actual Americans. The results are at times hilarious and equally disturbing considering some of the thoughts and feelings of the individuals Borat interacts with. It is always questionable which element of the film is more funny: Borat's questions or the American's responses. This film could be viewed as a sign of the times. It attempts to uncover the mainstream American culture. Arguably the best part about this feature was the controversy surrounding it upon release in the theaters. Cohen did his homework and scored a hit.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Suprisingly well-plotted for an 80 minute extension of Cohen's ulterior Ali G Show personality, Borat is unapologetically crude but often uproariously funny; it's certainly not for everyone but it also can convert non-believers (like myself) to Cohen's cause.</p></br><a href="../users/A25KKXUQQ0OLWB.html">A25KKXUQQ0OLWB</a><br/><p>I fell in love with Borat when he became my favorite character on the Da Ali G Show.  I am an ESOL Teacher and find other cultures interesting.  While it is very possible to see Sasha Baron Cohen's characterization of a Kazakhstan immigrant offensive, I think it has a lot more to do with how Americans deal with people from other countries and their beliefs of people who live in them.  Cohen seems determine to get Americans to take a look at their prejudices whether they are out there in plain sight or hidden under the guise of "tolerance".  I do have complaints about how hard he leans on gay jokes which I believe he is uncomfortable with, and the naked fight scene goes on far too long and offensively.  Of course, that is what Cohen sees as his bread and butter - giving offense to everyone and everybody.  I guess that includes me because I was not immune.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>I am misplace my inhibitions and hurt my stomach from much chuckling when I make watch this film.

Especially when the Golden Globe nominations  pegged both the film and the star as candidates for potential honors!!!!  And though many very fine reviewers find this film worthy of praise, the response after viewing the piece in a theater packed with people howling with laughter - again, for this viewer - was one of being appalled.<br /><br />Comedy is an art, an art that magnifies human foibles and allows a different viewpoint to make even sad aspects of life appear humorous. Dark comedy can be cruel when the writing is acerbically witty and smart.  What BORAT seems to have done is costume and scene change a standup comedy routine bent on grossing out its audience and choosing a demeaning manner instead of a parody to lash out at the multiple groups it attacks, be those the people of Kazakhstan, Pentecostal Holiness churches, drunk sexist/racist teenagers, feminists, businessmen, actors, Jews, homosexuals, rodeo folks, genteel Southerners, TV talk show hosts/weathermen, etc.<br /><br />Production wise the filming is crude, the storyline is plotted to look as though it were spontaneous candid camera takes (yet credits a long list of writers including Cohen), and the flatline character of Borat is as predictable as the potty mouth humor it accompanies.  But apparently the public wants this type of entertainment on the screens: the film is raking in millions for the effrontery of Sacha Baron Cohen.  Have we really arrived at a state where our choices range from comic book hero flicks to gory slasher flicks to the base, crude, and thoughtless antics of extended comedy hour routines?  Food for thought, but this viewer is obviously in the tiny minority.

Therefore, the 7 of 34 helpful votes you see might be reflective of that prior review.  "Reviewers of reviewers" can be so cruel!<br /><br />I saw this movie with my brother in a packed theater!  I rarely see movies in the theater anymore.  I just don't see the point of paying $7 - $10 for the movie, than $15, three to six months later for the DVD?  What's the point!  But my brother generously invited me, and I have to say, I'm very glad I accepted his invitation!  This movie was absolutely hilarious!  I think it was 10 X funnier than any movie I've seen in the past 10 years.  I even joked with my bro, I told him, I think that was even funnier than "The Apple Dumpling Gang" it being one of those movies that we saw as a kid, and thought was so hilarious, but if we were to watch it as adults, would think it was pretty stupid!<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILERS:<br />But this movie, Borat, we saw as adults, and got to laugh as kids again.  Wow!  What a rush!  I think the whole "man on man" love thing, was possibly the most hilarious thing ever caught on film!  I think his obsession with Pamela Anderson was also very funny!  Question:  Did Pamela act, or was she surprised by his attack at the Virgin Records store?  My brother and I were discussing that for a while!<br /><br />If you want to laugh as kids, but over very adult material, than go see this one, or rent it!  But be warned:  the material is quite adult.  I'm surprised this was Rated R, and not NC 17.  It was pretty bad.  Trust me!  You won't be sorry<br /><br />MC White said:  I have a new favorite comedy!

He lands in New York, falls in love with Pamela Anderson when he sees her on television, and so he and his producer Azamat make a road trip to meet her in California. This is the only plot of the film, and it is irrelevant to its purpose. Borat has benefited from the truth that there is no such thing as bad publicity. The controversial film will offend just about everyone with its anti-Semitic, racist, misogynist, homophobic, and anti-Christian humor. To me the problem with the film was not its vulgarity, which was plenty bad, but that the film simply wasn't funny, and that's a problem for a comedy. Some of Borat was staged, and other parts were real life ambushes of unsuspecting people; the directors will not say which parts are which. Those who defend Borat argue that it's a clever satire about bigotry; others argue that it aggravates it. Either way, save your time and money.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>The Apocalypse must surely be upon us! If the immense popularity of a mock-umentary film like `Borat' ('06) isn't a sign of the impending demise of Western Civilization then I don't know what is. Lewd, crude, demeaning and repulsive are just a few of the words that come to mind when I recall viewing this movie. Oh yes I forgot, not funny. It reminds me of the now defunct `Tom Green Show' that aired on MTV several years ago, it has that same type of documentary style in your face humor with Tom acting weird in public and freaking people out. `Borat' is kind of like Tom Green with an accent. There are a few funny sequences like the gypsy tears bit at a yard sale and the Mr. Jesus material was enjoyable, but the good moments are very few and far between.<br /><br />I've been told that I'm completely missing the point of the movie. It's supposed to be offensive, afterall it's pointing out societal norms and beliefs that are in and of themselves offensive. That's the point. I get the point and I'm not against scathing political or social satire, I just didn't enjoy this attempt.<br /><br />This film is definitely worth seeing ~ NOT!</p></br><a href="../users/A2JXAQ92WYPAAR.html">A2JXAQ92WYPAAR</a><br/><p>"Borat" is precisely what we have been waiting for, for fifty some years! Before WWII, American humor consisted of silliness. After the war, humor began to take itself seriously, particularly in the 60s with all these so-called brilliant comedians with college educations and axes to grind. Pure nonsense got lost along the way. Many of us have not forgotten, however, as evidenced by the continuing popularity of the Marx Brothers. Borat fits right in with that lovable family of goofs. Can't you just picture him there at the races with Harpo, Groucho, or Zeppo? The intelligence, of which he has plenty, is shown in his razor sharp satire. Oh, this goofiness should not be interpreted as stupidity. He's brilliant. He's a genius. He's sees a lot, and in this short film succeeds in showing as much about America that is true and deeply revealing as any of the serious dramas that incite rave reviews. Borat falls in with Harpo Marx and Forrest Gump as a lovable moron whose innocence is crucial for exposing the lies and hypocrisy of Americans, especially those who claim to be "good," "honest," or "proper." Borat is all about pulling the curtain aside to show everybody that the Wizard is a humbug.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>(And the packaging!)  I'm amazed they deleted the scene with the clueless grocery store manager... Yeah, it's kinda long, but it's also one of the funniest things I've ever seen on film.  I couldn't breathe I was laughing so hard. Overall, a fine comedy -- not as scabrous as I'd been led to believe, but still a scathing satire of contemporary life in the U.S. and A.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Not-too-bright Kazakshtanian reporter Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) with a camera-crew and buddy Azamat (Ken Davitian) heads from his beloved country to the USA to film a documentary on the culture of America. But at a hotel room in New York City, he watches a TV show called Baywatch as Pamela Anderson catches his eye and decides to head all the way from New York to California as he still films his documentary so he can get with Pamela as he encounters Jews (which are hated his in country), gays, African Americans, hookers and other crazy stuff on a cross trip country filmmaking trip.<br /><br />Brilliant social satire dark comedy-mockumentary from the creative genius of British comedy maestro Sacha Baron Cohen (Creator of "The Da Ali G Show") is one of his finest movies with "Da Ali G Movie" and "Bruno" which all formed a trilogy. This movie pushes no limits between taste and creativity as it's quite controversial as sometimes being antisemetic but Cohen is a British Jewish person and he defended this movie as being a satire on American culture including racism. The film is the best of Cohen's big trilogy but it may offend people but in a good way even with an unbelivable nude fight scene that has to be seen to believed.<br /><br />This DVD contains only three extras which is a shame such as deleted scenes, Global PR Tour and music informercial.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I remember when I first saw the previews for Borat and he promoted the movie as "I promise it'll be the funniest movie you'll ever see".  Yeah right.  The movie's about a man who travels across America and meets different people and religions and does nothing but disrespects them the entire time.  It's all because he wants to go to California and have a relationship with Pamela Anderson.<br /><br />The best way to respect the REAL people who actually had their feelings hurt during the recording of this film is to give it a low rating.  Sure, I laughed at a few parts, such as the bear in the ice cream truck scaring away children and the two naked men wrestling each other in the bedroom (in a very disgusting, almost sexual, way).  Still, everything about the movie was more about shocking the audience instead of delivering a satisfying story.  When the movie was finally released, many people found out they were involved in the film who didn't have a clue about it while the film was being made, and these people felt absolutely sick about the movie, and rightfully so.<br /><br />One man going across America making fun of all the cultures and religions isn't funny to me.  People have a right to hate this movie with a passion.  Some people try to convince me Borat didn't mean to make fun of the people in the film, but the expression on his face that he's supposedly clueless when in fact he's actually knowledgeable about different cultures paints a more accurate picture.  Avoid.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>I admit that I laughed pretty hard a few times while watching "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan." However, my overall opinion of this film is that it's truly tasteless and incredibly offensive to just about everyone.<br /><br />The film follows Kazakhstan journalist Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) on his journey across America. In addition to filming a documentary, Borat falls madly in love with Pamela Anderson after watching an old "Baywatch" rerun, and he desperately tries to get to California in order to make Pamela his wife so he can have "the sexy time" with her.<br /><br />Yes, "Borat" can be pretty funny at times. How can you NOT laugh at a man traveling across the country in an ice cream van with a grizzly bear in the rear compartment? However, there are a lot of things in the film that cross the line in terms of poking fun at women, Jews, etc. I probably could have taken all that in stride, though, if not for all the other crude elements of this movie. All the jokes about rape and bestiality were really pushing it, but the nakedness proved to be too much for me, especially the much-talked about nude fight scene between Borat and his travel companion, Azamat (Ken Davitian). Watching the two of them chase each other through the hotel nearly blinded me for life.<br /><br />"Borat" is good for a few cheap laughs, but I think it's an extremely uncouth film that isn't worthy of all the attention it has generated.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>By the time I finally saw Borat, every detail of the movie had been reported in detail in the media.  Part of Borat's hilarity is that it matches our hunger for reality-show type interaction with candid camera type events and in doing so, exposes the bigotry of its unwitting cast.<br /><br />The plot is almost beside the point, so I won't go over it in detail here.  Suffice it to say that Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) is a journalist new to America from Kazakhstan, making a film with his producer Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian).  They film every experience, from Borat singing a national anthem at a rodeo to Borat hitching a ride with drunk frat boys, Borat running naked in a hotel to Borat attending classes on social etiquette.<br /><br />Contrary to what the many lawsuits that arose from this film, most of the American citizens compose themselves admirably. Sure, there's the occasional bigoted jerk, but said jerks are easy to spot.  If you're shocked about a gun shop owner not blinking when Borat asks for a "gun to kill a Jew" then you haven't been to a gun shop.<br /><br />And perhaps that's part of the humor.  Borat visits places we know exist in America but haven't been there ourselves, and it shows the worst and best we have to offer in typical American fashion...by pointing a camera at it.<br /><br />But I don't buy it.<br /><br />One of the key elements of a magician's art is deception.  The magician will tell you he has nothing up his sleeve, but he most certainly does.  People picked from the audience who supposedly don't know the magician are actually trained plants. In short, magicians lie and we believe them because we want to.<br /><br />Similarly, Cohen's crafted a charade that this is all raw footage, and yet there's the omnipresent camera with its boom microphone and glaring lights. It's clear that the subjects, if they aren't in on the joke, are certainly pandering to the camera.  Until we invent floating invisible cameras or simply violate peoples' rights to make good television, this will always be the case.<br /><br />Borat is rude, crude, and hilarious.  But the amount of navel-gazing it created on behalf of the nation due to its supposedly candid look at America is unwarranted.  In the tradition of our reality TV culture, Borat is as authentic as...well, reality TV shows.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P9D22KDEXVMN.html">A3P9D22KDEXVMN</a><br/><p>There were some truly funny scenes in this movie.  Other scenes drew laughs that were the type that make you feel guilty for laughing.  Other parts of the movie were simply disgusting.  After reading some of the reviews, it is clear that there is no middle ground when it comes to this movie.  Some want to put it on a pedestal as a brilliant political comedy that pokes fun at America, while others simply lambast it.  I am taking the middle road here.  The movie is funny to watch, with some parts that make you cringe and feel uncomfortable even as an innocent observer.<br /><br />The most troubling aspects of this movie dealt with the sheer mean-spiritedness that some of the scenes featured.  For example, a very sweet jewish couple that ran the bed and breakfast.  Whether or not Cohen is Jewish, the way those people were treated showed little class.  If they were part of the joke, I would not be so disgusted; but I don't think they were.<br /><br />The fight between Cohen and his partner in which they were rolling around nude, served no point other than sick shock value.  How that scene, or the bathroom/dinner table scene serves as political commentary is beyond me.  There is no reason to make this movei more than it is.  It is a slapstick, low brow, comedy with some funny scenes and other scenes that are simply gross and geared towards the type of drunken college kids in the R.V. that Borat got drunk with.<br /><br />Three stars.  Not recommended for family viewing at all, but could be perfect for a drunken poker party.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F1FOR46702YF.html">A1F1FOR46702YF</a><br/><p>Comedian Sacha Baron Cohen (Da Ali G Show & Talladega Nights) takes a cross-country road-trip through the United States in the breakthrough comedy "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan". Popular TV journalist Borat Sagdiyev (Cohen) travels from his simple home in Kazakhstan to the United States to record a documentary about American customs to bring back to his beloved home. With his able producer Azamat Bagatov, Borat interacts with Americans and heads to California to seduce "Baywatch" star Pamela Anderson. "Borat" is an outrageously humorous mockumentary that showcases Cohen's fearless comedic talents. Most scenes in the movie are unscripted with real Americans. "Borat" isn't for everyone. Due to its prejudiced remarks, the mockumentary generated much controversy and was banned in several countries. In the United States, "Borat" received strong positive reviews by critics, became a commercial success and received numerous awards.<br /><br />If you enjoyed "Borat" in theaters then pick up your copy of critically acclaimed mockumentary on DVD. The mockumentary is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. Due to the various types of cameras used in the film, the picture quality is somewhat mixed but still pretty sharp. The 5.1 Dolby Digital sound isn't terrific but still clean and well-balanced. The DVD contains 8 deleted scenes that were cut from the film, and a 17-minute collection of footage made to promote the film. Overall, "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan" earns a "B".</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>BUT hilariously funny!!

I was laughing so hard I got light-headed and feared I would pass out.  Thank god I saw this film less than a half-mile from a hospital.<br /><br />Can't wait for the DVD -- can't wait to see the stuff that DIDN'T make it into the film.

After falling in love with CJ on Baywatch, Borat convinces his producer companion to leave NYC in search of California (and Pamela Anderson) so that they might cross the US and A and find real culture. Armed with his vial of gypsy tears to ward off evil, a wild bear, and a dilapidated ice cream truck, the two companions from Kazakhstan head west.  What ensues is comedic blasphemy to the point of needing an oxygen bottle to maintain consciousness; because you will laugh yourself into asphyxia.<br /><br />Shot for real cheap.  The producers of this film scored a hit and scored hard.  As for the controversy and all that.  I'll say this: No one is holding a gun to your head to watch this!!  Right?  Gawd!  People are so f*cking uptight nowadays!  Get a clue.  This is the most tongue-in-cheek movie ever made!  There are no boundries.  And the most hysterical thing is that most of the people in this movie (supposedly) had no idea that it wasn't real.  That is the sheer genius of Borat.  They took real people, put them into uncomfortable situations, and watched the results.  Most people aren't very nice when they're nudged in the wrong direction and Borat proves that.  If people can't take a joke, f*ck them!  There are far too many other attrocities going on in the world to be wasting time protesting a movie.<br /><br />Borat is obviously not going to be for everyone, but if you want to laugh yourself hoarse and you have a somewhat open-minded sense of humor, buy it right now.  You won't be disappointed.  The deleted scenes are hysterical too.<br /><br />DIG IT!!!!!</p></br></body></html>

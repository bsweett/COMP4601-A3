It just draaaags at many points. Some might call it sweepingly epic, though the term pointlessly overblown also applies. Considering the hype, I'd call it the most overrated movie I've seen in years.<br /><br />The real dealbreaker for me was the music, which is horridly manipulative from the very start, portending doom during simple expository shots and generally calling notice to itself all the time. I love a good score, but only when it fits hand in glove with the movie. This stuff is more like foot on hand.<br /><br />Lewis is the highlight, and he is indeed excellent, making us care about a man who's not very worthy of much love. Upton Sinclair's story is somewhat overdone here, though; despite some fine moments, I just stopped caring about what happened to whom about 90 minutes in, and knowing we were in for another 70 minutes was somewhat sigh-inducing.<br /><br />Which is too bad, as this film would have wowed me if cut to about 100 minutes, or at most two hours. But maybe that's just me. I'd heard so much for so long that I expected too much and got much less than hoped for. Excepting Lewis, always a treat to watch.<br /><br />Nonetheless, there is no way I'd want to see this again for a year or three, even for a barrel of oil.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>No Country For Old Men and There Will Be Blood have often been compared with each other. This is due to the fact that both were from the same studios (Miramax & Paramount Vintage), and were in production at the same time (and right next to each other). I don't see why people should argue which film is better than the other. They're two completely different films. NCFOM is based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, while TWBB is based on the book "Oil!" by Upton Sinclair. NCFOM is set in 1980, TWBB is set in the early 20th century. One's about violence, the other's about greed. And so on. But I do admit, I slightly prefer NCFOM over TWBB, mostly because of the silent suspense and the absolutely creepy performance of Javier Bardem. But TWBB is still a great film as well.<br /><br />As I've said before, this film is mostly about greed and how it affects us and the people around us. Daniel Plainview (played by the excellent Daniel Day-Lewis) is a wealthy businessman who relies on oil for his profits. Accompanied by his adopted son H.W. (Dillon Freasier), both individuals are led to a barren California city called Little Boston. There, they discover oil that's been leaked out of the ground due to a recent earthquake. With careful planning, Daniel attempts to buy the entire city, with just a few issues at hand. A young man by the name of Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) wants $10,000 to build his church, The Church of the Third Revelation. From this point on, it's a battle between religion, hypocrisy, wealth, and family.<br /><br />Like NCFOM, TWBB tends to be very slow-moving. I see this in a good way. This film doesn't move too quick because we get to see the characters being clearly and fully affected by the oil that's sleeping underground. They are fully realized, as the slow pacing helps us understand these people. Speeding it up in a Hollywoodized way won't help since this is indeed a character-driven story. With the slower and steadier way, there is no confusion on what's going on, and the partial ambiance that surrounds the movie adds to the tension between Daniel and Eli. Speaking of Daniel and Eli, I just have to say that the actors have done a splendid job. Before this, I've seen only one film that stars Day-Lewis: Last of the Mohicans. He was absolutely amazing in that film, and he is even more amazing here. You never know when he's going to lose his temper, or what he's really going to do in the next scene, which makes the character even scarier. Meanwhile, according to imdb, Dano had only four days to prepare for the role of Eli, since another actor had to be replaced for reasons unknown. Thankfully, he was able to pull it off. The quiet determination of the character is fully realized, and you can never tell if he's a hypocrite or just someone who thinks he's seen God. As for the supporting cast, they play their parts very well. The one exception here is Kevin J. O'Connor: he's seems very wooden at times. But other than that, Dillon Freasier and the other supporting actors can be very believable throughout the entire film.<br /><br />Almost everything else in TWBB(cinematography, set designs, etc.) are flawless. And I say almost, because I had just one tiny problem. A few music cues that are chosen here don't seem to fit the scenes that they play in. But the music can be very appropriate at times, like Johhny Greenwood's percussive "Convergence" when both tragedy and success strike in the middle of the film. The piece itself adds greater suspense and drama in this very important part of the film. TWBB overall is one of the more marvelous films of 2007. Day-Lewis deserved the oscar, as well as Robert Elswit for the stellar cinematography.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"There Will Be Blood" is Paul Thomas Anderson's loose interpretation of Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel "Oil!". In this version, prospector Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis) sets out to become an oil magnate in turn-of-the-century California. He aggressively obtains drilling rights from landowners under somewhat dubious terms and pays them a royalty. In 1911, a man from the town of New Boston sells Daniel information about oil on his family ranch. With his young son H.W. (Dillon Freasier), Daniel sets out to buy all the land he can get in New Boston before his competitors do. But his promises to bring prosperity to the town must compete with charismatic local religious demagogue Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) for the hearts and souls of the citizens.<br /><br />"There Will Be Blood" is entertaining for about two-thirds of its 2 hour 38 minute run time. We spend the first 15 minutes watching Daniel prospect for silver and oil, to give you some idea of the pace. The story is not in any way realistic beyond the naturalistic production design, and the last third goes too far over the top to sustain credibility. As is typical of Paul Thomas Anderson, who wrote as well as directed this film, it's not clear just what the film is supposed to be. Every scene unfolds with gravity, but the endless power struggle between Daniel and Eli is black comedy. Daniel Day Lewis' Oscar-winning performance is not realistic, but rather an affected acting style that is suited to the film's dark humor and implausible behavior.<br /><br />We seem to have a black comedy and a character study that is hardly believable, presented as epic drama. It makes very little sense. Daniel Day Lewis' histrionics must carry the entire film. And they do. Daniel Plainview believes in single-minded ambition for its own sake, and his venom is something to see. The conflict with Eli Sunday is perversely amusing. And young H.W., buffeted about by his father's goals, evokes the audience's sympathy. Mind you, they are in a plot whose parts do not coalesce. And beyond the director's low opinion of oilmen and preachers, there is no point, and for a while I thought there would be no end. But most of it is entertaining, so this is a big improvement as Paul Thomas Anderson's films go.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Loosely based upon the novel OIL by Upton Sinclair, writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson takes a portion of Sinclair's original story and makes it his own in THERE WILL BE BLOOD, a movie about greed, oil, power, and duplicity.  THERE WILL BE BLOOD follows the life of Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis).  For the first fifteen minutes of the movie, not a word is spoken.  The audience watches as Plainview seems to be mining for gold, but is instead ultimately looking for oil.  He slowly continues digging for black gold, eventually pulling it out from the ground one bucket at the time.  Time progresses and a small crew is added.  Tragedy strikes the crew and the baby of one of the workers is left orphaned.  Plainview takes the child and adopts the boy as his own to use as a prop as he travels across the country asking people to let him mine their oil for them.<br /><br />Years later in 1911, Plainview is approached by a young man named Paul Sunday (Paul Dano).  Sunday is from a small community called Little Boston and he tells Plainview that there is so much oil in his hometown that it seeps out of the ground when it rains.  In exchange for some money, he shows Plainview the location of the land and disappears from the story.  Plainview and H.W.(Dillon Freasier), his son, investigate the land and discover that what Paul said was indeed true.  Without mentioning Paul, Plainview befriends the Sunday family and impresses upon them what he wants to do and how important it is.  At first the family isn't impressed, particularly Paul's twin brother Eli (Dano), but after listening to Plainview's eloquent speech and being satisfied that the new industry will benefit not only the town but Eli's church, the family agrees and promises to get the other townspeople together for a meeting.  As the drilling for the oil commences, so, too, does the power struggle between Eli and Daniel.  They both are greedy and hunger for power, but use very different means and arenas to obtain it.<br /><br />The final portion of the film fastforwards to 1927, allows the audience to see what has become of the majors characters, and gives the story an incomplete coda.  Daniel is wealthy beyond one's imagination, but is so eaten up by suspicion, hatred, and greed that he disowns H.W.  Meanwhile, Eli has become an internationally known preacher, but has almost become as corrupt as Daniel.<br /><br />The acting in THERE WILL BE BLOOD is astonishing.  Daniel Day-Lewis is at the top of his game, which is saying a lot for a man who sometimes takes years to study for a role and immerse himself into the character.  Day-Lewis offered the strongest performance of the year and well deserved the Best Actor Oscar he received.  Paul Dano also gives a wonderful performance, and even though he was overlooked by the Academy, he should have at least been nominated for a Supporting Actor award.  Day-Lewis had over a year to study for his role, but Dano was cast as Eli Sunday after shooting on the film had already begun.<br /><br />Another component of THERE WILL BE BLOOD that I really enjoyed was the score by Johnny Greenwood.  The music in the film is full of dissonance, which reflects the inner turmoil of the characters beneath the cool exteriors and posing relationships they have with each other.  The music screeches and shrieks, yet like the Sirens' call there is something mysteriously enchanting about it.<br /><br />THERE WILL BE BLOOD is a dark and sometimes disturbing drama about greed, power, duplicity, and ultimately murder.  Cinematically the film is comparable the CITIZEN KANE, but the two movies are very different.  KANE offers the story of a man corrupted by power who had some redeeming characteristics, but THERE WILL BE BLOOD follows the story of a man consumed by evil with no redeeming characteristics.  I am reminded of Macbeth and the story told by an idiot full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.  Though it might not signify anything, even an idiotic story can be an entertaining one.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>Is Daniel Day-Lewis the best actor in the world?  Given his reluctance to make many films this is a difficult question to answer.  Certainly there is no actor today of whom we expect truly extraordinary things on the rare occasions he does make a major movie.  Despite having turned in several unforgettable performances over the years of almost inconceivable range -- just contrast his effeminate fop in ROOM WITH A VIEW with his sexy Tomas in THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING with his Hawkeye as ultimate action hero in THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS with his wheelchair bound Christy Brown in MY LEFT FOOT (for which he justifiably won his first Oscar) with his unfairly accused political prisoner in IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER (second Oscar nomination) with the brutal Bill the Butcher in THE GANGS OF NEW YORK (third Oscar nomination).  Which is the real Daniel Day-Lewis?  None of them?  All of them?  What is so intensely exciting about Day-Lewis as an actor is how completely he becomes who he is playing.  It is hard to imagine him being different than he is in the film.  He is famous for the degree to which he stays "in character" during the filming of a movie.  I can only imagine that it takes him several days if not weeks to come down from wherever he has to exist while performing a role.<br /><br />I saw THERE WILL BE BLOOD the night before the Oscars.  The Academy Awards frequently not only get things wrong, but also do so in quite stupid ways.  They have a long history of this.  Remember, neither Alfred Hitchcock nor Barbara Stanwyck ever won Oscars, nor did Ernst Lubitsch nor Cary Grant, not did . . . and the list could go on forever.  But I left the theater completely convinced that for once a performance was so astonishing that not even the often absurd Oscars could get this one wrong.  Nor did they.  In fact, if you could do a winners competition among the Oscar winners, Day-Lewis might beat out all the other winners this decade for a sort of Super Oscar.  I don't remember the last time I saw a performance this amazing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I'm not convinced the rest of the movie is as good as Day-Lewis.  I give it five stars, but I wonder if it is the masterpiece many are proclaiming it.  I'll share my doubts later in the review.  There were many things I loved in the film.  I don't remember the last time I loved an incidental sound track like I did this one (though of course, a film like ONCE, where the music was central to the whole film, is a completely different matter -- one of the other things I loved at this year's Oscars was Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova winning an Oscar of their own).  The music was sometimes lyrical, but more often it was atmospheric, generating an almost visceral reaction.  ONCE aside, this may have been the movie from 2007 whose music I most enjoyed.<br /><br />And visually this was a delight.  Shot after shot was a complete delight.  Even today, several days after having seen the movie, a host of brilliant images come to mind.  The bare, sparse, almost ascetic sets were haunting.  I especially love the beginning of the film.  It must have been at least 15 to 20 minutes into the film before the first word was spoken.  Yet during that time we learn so much about Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis) and the world he inhabits.  It is brutal, demanding, and dangerous work.<br /><br />Obviously Paul Thomas Anderson means the film in a topical way.  I actually read many, many years ago Upton Sinclair's OIL, the book upon which this film was loosely based.  Sinclair was, of course, an ardent socialist, a position I'm not at all out of sympathy with.  Like Sinclair and, apparently, Anderson, I agree that capitalism is a very dangerous, extraordinarily unproductive economic system.  Well, it is productive for those at the top, but not for most of the people within that economy.  But my complaints are far more specific, with the delusions of the free marketers (if the free marketers ever bothered to actually read Adam Smith they would discover that he is not a free marketer, since he believed that there should be many moral limits placed on economic enterprise -- in other words, Smith felt that government might need to intervene in an economy, something the most ardent free marketers would deny).  Now I go into this in a tiny bit of detail to contrast it with what THERE WILL BE BLOOD says about capitalism, which is:  capitalism is bad.  There is no subtlety in the depiction of Plainview as a capitalist.  We see that in the end it leaves neither the exploiter nor the exploited happy, but is that because there is something messed up on the system?  Or is it simply because Plainview is a sociopath?<br /><br />Anderson strikes out against the second great blight on American life today.  If free market utopians have destroyed the economic well being of most Americans by their promises that if we just stick with the market, all will benefit (embodied in various trickle down theories -- but as one of Plainview's contemporaries, Will Rogers, liked to explain, gold isn't, like many assume, like water.  If you put it at the top of a pile, it doesn't trickle down to everything below.  Nope, Gold is like Gold.  Put it at the top and it just stays there).  But the second blight on American life is clearly a politicized fundamentalist Christianity.  If Anderson aims one barrel of his shotgun at capitalist exploiters, the other is at false religious leaders.  The two forces clash for the length of the film, until literally coming to blows at the end.  But again, apart from just throwing Eli's hypocritical preacher out there as a symbol of the emptiness of religion gone bad, nothing is either said or even hinted at on a deeper level.  We all know that there are charlatan preachers.  We know there are religious demagogues like James Dobson and Pat Robertson.  Just as Plainview says nothing about capitalism in general, so Eli says nothing about religion in general.  They are paraded out as symbols, but their symbolism is never truly investigated.<br /><br />Nonetheless, if this is not a deep film, it is on the surface of things a brilliant one.  There are so many great moments.  The scene in which Plainview converts to Christianity in order to get the rights to take his pipeline across the property of one old crank is as unforgettable as any scene you'll ever encounter.<br /><br />By the way, the line from the film that is quickly becoming one of the most famous from any recent film - "I drink your milkshake" - comes, according to an interview I heard with Paul Thomas Anderson, from testimony that Senator Albert Fall gave during the Teapot Dome Scandal.  Fall was explaining about "drainage," drilling at an angle to take oil that is below the surface of someone else's land.  (Not that I'm trying to justify Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, but what precipitated that invasion was precisely Kuwait's stealing Iraq's oil by drilling at a sharp angle at their border into Iraqi oil reserves.  Iraq actually had a legitimate complaint against Kuwait, though I'm sure no one believes that this justified their invading the smaller country.)  Anderson claimed - I have not independently verified this - that Fall used the same image as that in the film.  Namely, "If you have a milkshake and I have a milkshake, and my straw reaches all across the room, then I drink your milkshake."  Though Anderson also admits he embellished the line a bit.  No question that Daniel Day-Lewis sold the line.<br /><br />But in the end, there is one main reason for seeing this film:  Daniel Day-Lewis.  Before I saw this I would have put him on the shortest of short lists of the great actors of his age.  Now I truly think he stands alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEJIORC1MBG3.html">A2FEJIORC1MBG3</a><br/><p>In the audacious opening shot of his magnificent, sprawling, demented epic, "There Will Be Blood", director P.T. Anderson presents us with a tracking shot of a vast expanse of rocky, desolate scrub land, scored by an ominous, discordant drone. When the camera (literally) disappears down a hole, we are introduced to the story's protagonist, a lone, shadowy figure, chiseling away at the subterranean rock wall of a derelict well with a fierce, single-minded determination. There is nary a word of dialogue uttered during the ensuing 15 minutes or so of screen time; yet through the masterful implementation of purely cinematic language, we are given a sufficient enough glimpse so as to feel that we may already have some inkling of what it is that drives this man, even though we do not yet even know his name. Stylistically, this scene is more than a little reminiscent of the prologue for "2001: A Space Odyssey". What we witness in the film's introduction may not be quite as profound or seminal as Kubrick's rendering of "the dawn of man", but it does put the spotlight on something just as primeval. It is something that is buried deep within the capitalist DNA-the relentless drive to amass wealth and power through willful exploitation and opportunism (hey, don't knock it- it's what made this country great!)<br /><br />Flash forward a few years, and we find that our mystery man not only has a name, but has made a name for himself in the midst of California's turn-of-the-century oil boom. The ambitious Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) has moved up from prospecting for precious metals to leasing tracts of land for the oil drilling rights. He is well on his way to becoming a very wealthy man. He did not get to this place in his life by being a nice guy (who does?). He is a bachelor; but in order to give an impression as a sincere "family man", he totes a young orphan along to business meetings, who he introduces as his son (not unlike Ryan and Tatum O'Neal's con artist team in "Paper Moon"). In his worldview, you are either with him, or you are his "competitor". In fact, Plainview is the quintessential lone wolf, having very little tolerance or use for people in general, unless they can help him further his agenda.<br /><br />Plainview's biggest payday arrives in the form of a furtive and enigmatic young man named Paul Sunday (Paul Dano), who walks out of the desert one day with a hot tip about a possible oil field that lies beneath his family's central California ranch land. Everything appears to be going swimmingly until Plainview crosses paths with Sunday's twin brother Eli (also played by Dano) a fire and brimstone evangelical who sees his family's business partnership with Plainview as a potential cash cow for building up his ministry. The relationship between these two characters forms the heart of the story's conflict.<br /><br />Plainview and Sunday are in reality two peas in a pod; they both employ their own fashion of charlatanism and manipulation to get what they want. They circle each other warily, grudgingly accepting that they need each other to achieve their goals. Plainview sees himself as an empire builder, and promises the milk and honey of economic prosperity to sway the landowners to his way of thinking. The somewhat unhinged Sunday envisions himself as a prophet, and uses the lure of eternal life and the theatrics of faith healing to win over his followers. He clearly sees (plainly views?) Plainview as the Devil; this is proffered by the director in one of the film's most stunning visual moments, where Anderson frames Day-Lewis in ominous silhouette against the hellish backdrop of an oil well fire, recalling the image of Chernabog in the "Night on Bald Mountain" segment from "Fantasia". I also think it is significant to note that when we are first introduced to Plainview, he emerges from underground (the Underworld?). The resulting confilict between prophet and profiteer makes for a compelling tale.<br /><br />The story spans thirty years; culminating on the eve of the Depression, by which time the obscenely wealthy but completely soulless Plainview has morphed into a reclusive Charles Foster Kane type figure, alone in his mansion. The film's jaw-dropping climatic scene is destined to be dissected and argued over by film buffs for some years to come.<br /><br />The story is rich in allegory; especially in the character of Plainview, who is the very personification of the blood-soaked history of profit-driven expansionism in America (and it goes without saying that the particular brand of puritanical religious zealotry represented by Sunday has been responsible for its fair share of damage throughout U.S. history as well). This film reminded me, oddly enough, of the excellent documentary "The Corporation", in which the filmmakers build a psychological profile of the typical corporation, as if it were a person. The summation from that film's official website says:<br /><br />"To assess the `personality' of the corporate `person,' a checklist is employed, using diagnostic criteria of the World Health Organization and the standard diagnostic tool of psychiatrists and psychologists. The operational principles of the corporation give it a highly anti-social `personality': it is self-interested, inherently amoral, callous and deceitful; it breaches social and legal standards to get its way; it does not suffer from guilt, yet it can mimic the human qualities of empathy, caring and altruism."<br /><br />That works for me as a profile of Plainview, and to some extent, Sunday as well. The famously dedicated and meticulous Day-Lewis is nothing short of astonishing in his role. I dare say it is one of his finest performances to date. He does make some interesting choices; especially in his carefully measured vocal inflection. I swear that he is uncannily channeling the voice of the late Jack Palance. But it works-and maybe it's not such a stretch, since director Anderson appears to be channeling the mythic style of George Stevens' westerns ("Giant", obviously; and in a tangential sense, "Shane"). Credit must also go to Paul Dano ("Little Miss Sunshine"), who does an admirable job of holding his own against the greatest character actor on earth. In a recent TV interview, Dano said that Day-Lewis never once broke character, even refusing to acknowledge him off-camera.<br /><br />This marks the most cohesive and mature work from director Anderson, who adapted his screenplay from Upton Sinclair's novel "Oil!". Anderson's previous films have shown a tendency to polarize critics and audiences. I personally find him one of the most unique American filmmakers working today, and I think that this movie is going to surprise a lot of people. Kudos as well for Radiohead guitarist Johnny Greenwood's soundtrack.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ST1XBL6EQTBV.html">A1ST1XBL6EQTBV</a><br/><p>I went out and bought this film  on 2-disc DVD over all the<br />hoopla at the Oscars over it, and I must say that it just<br />left me feeling like it was "Just, Okay"!!--That's all!<br />Daniel Day-Lewis does get deep into his roles and is totally believable<br />in his role as the ruthless, scheming, maniacal lead character!<br />The boy who plays his adopted son is great too.<br />But there is much inconsistency and uneveness in the story-telling.<br />The so-called rivalry between Daniel Day-Lewis's character and<br />the bible-thumping young religious zealot boy who stands up<br />to him is not illustrated well..(only a few uneven scenes here<br />and there, which makes me think that some of the better<br />scenes are on the cutting room floor!)<br />Don't get me wrong, there are some great moments too!<br />But in the big scheme...Ehhh, not so much!<br />I agree with one of the reviewers who said that the second disc<br />sucks as far as special features go!</p></br><a href="../users/A3LH77PBDFEO3F.html">A3LH77PBDFEO3F</a><br/><p>When There Will Be Blood came out I was very interested in seeing it. My family was involved in the oil industry in one way or another from 1959 to 1987. One of the first places the film names is Signal Hill in Long Beach CA where my mother was a dispatcher for many years, and my father was a scientist that developed the project to inject steam into the tar in Yorba Linda Ca, that was later adopted to Kern County and other places that provide a majority of domestic crude oil. I myself worked for many years on oil rigs in Kern County (Oildale, Belridge, Taft etc. until my last day when I nearly lost my hand in '87) So.... I thought a film about the early days of California's oil industry would be fascinating.<br /><br />But here is the deal,<br />Every character in the film is  so narcissistic and amoral that the great acting and stunning cinematography was just wasted. I didn't care about any of the characters in the story (with the exception of the wife of the son) enough to enjoy the film at all.<br /><br />So if you want a movie that is well acted, and well filmed, but is unmoving and dull with an annoying soundtrack, this is for you.

He is a man willing to endure pain and humiliation to grasp more money, or more power.  As he quickly moves from gold to black gold, he becomes more powerful, and his ruthlessness and underhandedness become more and more apparent, combined with the charisma required to persuade landowners to part with the mineral rights of their property.  We learn about how he sees other people when he adopts a boy who he finds useful to put a kind face on his activities, and how he treats a man appears claiming to be his half brother.  The movie kicks into gear though when he meets an equally power hungry man in the unlikely form of the young faith healer and preacher, to whom he takes a seemingly instant dislike.  With the relationships with these three characters, we see his dilemna- his power is only something if he can pass it on, but when he sees only the worst in other people, how can he?  Who will be worthy of the three to take on his mantle..?<br />The style of the movie has some stunning direction which tells us much of the story through scenes and images, rather than words, yet this is married with an intelligent, absorbing and uncompromising script.  The music is daringly inventive, although with me the jury is out whether it is a success or a distraction.<br />Daniel Day-Lewis turns in yet another 100% authentic and believable performance, creating a chilling and yet at times charismatic character, and Paul Dano is remarkable as the young preacher.<br />Sure, women are given little to no role in the story, and it is unremitting in its bleakness, at times feeling like it has been designed to within an inch of its cinematic life.  It's not going to be to everyone's taste..

There Will Be Blood is one of them, and is arguably the best effort that writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson has ever put to celluloid, most notably thanks to the brilliant, Oscar winning performance of Daniel Day-Lewis as oil tycoon Daniel Plainview.  Plainview's rise is chronicled as he, along with his adopted son H.W. (Dillon Freasier), sets sights on an oil-rich land inhabited by the Sunday family, whose evangelist son Eli (Paul Dano) Plainview soon comes into conflict with.  There is even more going on in between all the proceedings, as Anderson presents an amalgamation of greed, love, redemption, and torment.  Not only is Daniel Day-Lewis a magnetic sight to behold, but every other performance (from Freasier, to Dano, to Kevin J. O'Connor, to Ciaran Hinds) are their own little miracles.  Everything else, from Anderson's direction, to brilliant and breathtaking cinematography, to a hair raising music score; all adds up to the modern day masterpiece that is There Will Be Blood.  While it is certainly not for all tastes, There Will Be Blood is a brilliant film regardless, and in that respect alone, the film is a must-see.</p></br><a href="../users/A8DI0COTCMRDV.html">A8DI0COTCMRDV</a><br/><p>Some of the reviews here on amazon for this film are not only quite interesting but more so they are quite egotistical sounding. P.T. Anderson's "There Will Be Blood"(in my personal opinion)is a masterpiece! Now I'm not the most educated reviewer here on amazon so I speak for myself and do not intend to push on you what you should think about this film(or any film for that matter). For me the story that is being told  is always very important, but never as important as the way in wich the storyteller chooses to tell it. "There Will Be Blood" is a brilliant example of a director taking a ordinary tale of good old american greed and turning it into an extraordinary tale of how the darkness of the human soul tends to destroy the lighter more intelegent side. This is no "good guy, bad guy" movie. This is real life where everyone has a good and bad side and(I quote Daniel Plainview)where religion is nothing but a superstition. This is a place where power cries out to the ugly side of life and money pumps the veins and keeps our 75% souless existance moving foward and will surely be the reason for our demise. It seems a few reviewers here at amazon pretty much(in so many words)believe that they would have made a better movie than P.T. Anderson but to each is there own. A film like this was meant to provoke the viewer and leave it up to the individual to come out the otherside gripping his or her own conclusion and/or opinion in the same way a painting or a song can. All I know is I truly was moved by this film and all it's components especially the score and cinematography and still hold true to my opinion that Daniel Day Lewis may very well be the greatest actor alive!</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>Very dark, but poignant story of a crazed oil man who has a passion for money and little use for people.  I kept hoping for an enlightening moment in this dark character, but his humanity just continues to seep out of his soul like the oil than runs from the ground, and he continues to make deep wounds in the earth...and himself. There appears to be no cure for the main character (played by Daniel Day Lewis), his heart just grows harder and more destructive.  Opportunities for redemption and love are right in front of him, but he turns a blind eye. The story is rich in emotion and the acting riveting, but there is no happy ending.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay  -  Author</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar in 2008 for his performance in this film. I can well understand why. Cast as an unscrupulous oil tycoon in the early part of the 20th century, he paints the portrait of true greed and ruthlessness.  He has no relationships, no family and no regrets as he cheats people out of their land in order to build oil wells.  There is no dialogue for the first 15 minutes of the film.  We see him prospecting for gold in a makeshift and dangerous shaft.  He's alone, and when he has a fall that breaks his leg, he pulls himself out of the shaft in grit and determination.  His characterization is set then.<br /><br />Later we see him working on a mine with a small baby in a basket.  He tells everyone this is his son and that his wife has died in childbirth, but throughout the film we never meet any woman in his life and there is no back story at all about the child.  He calls the child his son and is grooming him to be an oilman and there are some very poignant scenes between these two.  And then, an accident happens and his son becomes deaf.  The father does what he thinks is right, but leaves the son hating him forever.<br /><br />Into this mix comes a young evangelical preacher, played by Paul Dano, whose family sold oil to the oilman.  This young man is a religious zealot and wants say a prayer to dedicate the first oil well that is dug on the land.  But the oilman disrespects him and embarrasses him instead and this leads to a lifelong hatred and competition between them both, resulting in a rather confusing and violent conclusion to the film.<br /><br />The acting was superb. The theme was fascinating, and it moved so fast that its length of 158 minutes didn't bother me at all.  It is not for everybody though because it is very violent and the theme and plot are not tied up neatly.  Frankly, though I loved it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>The central character in "There Will Be Blood", oil tycoon Daniel Plainview (played by thoroughbred thespian Daniel Day-Lewis) is a fascinatingly repugnant character. He's greedy, ruthless, cruel, and shamelessly manipulative, to be sure ... but it's really the touch of humanity he occasionally displays that truly makes him tragic, because you can see that beneath all his contempt is a sad, broken-hearted man. Although capable of affection, whenever Daniel feels abandoned or betrayed he reacts viciously and often violently, destroying any possibility of authentic relationships.<br /><br />Throughout the movie his character's fate is tied to that of Eli Sunday, a theatrical minister who, despite superficial differences, is as ruthlessly ambitious as Plainview is. Sunday is Plainview's nemesis and mirror ... their mutual hatred is due to the fact that they surely see all of their own loathsome qualities reflected in the other. Throughout the film the two characters spar, compete, play mind games and torture each other.<br /><br />Although the film ends with a final confrontation between the two characters in which one apparently "wins", powerhouse director P.T. Anderson makes it clear that there are no real winners in this film, just empty characters who sold their souls to the devil long ago. "There Will Be Blood" is an indictment of human nature, the destructiveness of anger and greed, and the American Dream gone horrible awry.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>This movie is too long and too slow.... I think that it could have been made into a much shorter length movie and made its point in much less time then the 2.5 hours it took to do so.<br /><br />The acting on all counts by all cast members was magnificent. Daniel Day Lewis is perfect for the role of Daniel Plainview, the single-minded individual whose sole purpose in life is to get rich through mining oil.... Daniel Plainview is an entirely ruthless individual whom isn't above lying and using any other devious means necessary to obtain what he wants.... Primarily money, wealth, success and power. Plainview doesn't have friends and hates humanity at large and is unwavering in his behavior throughout the entire movie. It is a bit difficult to believe anyone could be this callous, ruthless, and downright mean as Daniel Plainview.... He's almost one dimensional because he is so one sided in his callousness.<br /><br />This movie seems to represent what one will do out of greed/hunger for money and conquest. It is as if the ends justify the means no matter what the cost is.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>Since hitting it big with 1997's critically-lauded "Boogie Nights," Paul Thomas Anderson has stood in the front ranks of American filmmakers.  Actually, Anderson has crouched in the front ranks, dreaming about what would make a great shot and how he could do this scene or that scene, while all the other filmmakers stand around and chat.  For his fifth film, "There Will Be Blood," Anderson has set aside his trademark Altman-esque lushness for a style which recalls Francis Ford Coppola in his prime.  Finally, Anderson stands in the front ranks - and it comes as no surprise that he has perfect posture.<br /><br />The spine of "There Will Be Blood" is Daniel Day-Lewis, who stars as oil-drilling entrepeneur Daniel Plainview.  It is the single greatest performance of Day-Lewis' distinguished career as an actor.  To go further, it is one of the greatest performances in cinematic history.  Daniel Plainview is one of the most fascinating and complex protagonists ever seen on the big screen.  I use the term "protagonist" loosely.  Plainview is as slimey as the oil he has devoted his life to drilling, and as dangerous as the tools he uses to do so.  He may look human, he may sound human, and at times he may even act like a genuine human being, but if there is any humanity in this man, it is buried deeper than the oil he drills.<br /><br />Plainview swindles people out of their homes, their property, their fortunes, without a care.  But what makes the character so interesting is the sneaking suspicion that he's not completely cold, that there is humanity in the depths of his soul, or was, at one point.  It seems like he may love his adopted son, H. W. (Dillon Freasier) - but just when we're sure he does, Anderson pulls the rug out from under our feet.  Plainview's memories of "back home," recounted to his brother Henry (Kevin J. O'Connor), are worth noting.  Plainview talks about a house he saw when he was a boy.<br /><br />"I thought as a boy that was the most beautiful house I'd ever seen, and I wanted it," Plainview remembers.  "I wanted to live in it, and eat in it, and clean it.  And even as a boy, I wanted to have children to run around in it."<br /><br />Henry points out that Plainview can have anything he wants now.  He can make his own house, one that looks just like the house from his childhood.<br /><br />Plainview grimaces.  "I'm sure if I saw that house now," he spits, "it would make me sick."<br /><br />It's one of two scenes in the film which offer glimpses into Plainview's soul, or what remains of it.  The second also involves Henry: this time, Plainview admits, "I see the worst in people.  I don't need to look past seeing them to get all I need.  I've built my hatreds up over the years, little by little ... I can't keep doing this on my own, with all these ... people."  He spits out the last part as though he'd swallowed an insect, and then he laughs.  The world is his own private joke.<br /><br />But there can be no joking about Day-Lewis' performance.  Daniel Plainview is in his eyes.  He's in the way he talks, the way he moves, the way he breathes.  He is Daniel Plainview.  And though the film rests upon his broad and sturdy shoulders, he is supported by a similarly talented cast.<br /><br />Highlighting the supporting cast is young Paul Dano, last seen as the irritating emo kid from "Little Miss Sunshine."  Dano, as the media has noted, plays two different roles: brothers Paul and Eli Sunday.  Paul Sunday appears in only one scene, informing Daniel Plainview of the wealth of oil ready to be drilled on the Sunday farm.  Eli Sunday is, essentially, the head of the Sunday family, and even the head of the town.  He leads the local church, and delivers passionate sermons that are, frankly, godawful.  He is also the thorn in Daniel Plainview's side.  It's the perfect role for Dano to showcase a depth not even hinted at in his previous roles.  He may be one to watch out for in the future.<br /><br />Dillon Freasier is also noteworthy.  There is something absolutely fascinating about his distant and confused portrayal of H. W. Plainview.  He seems like the embodiment of all the good devoid from his adoptive father.  This is Freasier's first film role, but he's already make his mark.<br /><br />Paul Thomas Anderson, on the other hand, made his mark a decade ago, but only with "There Will Be Blood" has he truly had an impact on cinematic history.  Though elements of the film may recall the work of Stanley Kubrick, or the work of Robert Altman (who was one of the biggest influences on Anderson's previous films), this is the first film Anderson has made which has felt wholly original.  It's the work of a true visionary.  Finally, Anderson feels like the god behind-the-scenes who ties together all the threads of existence, rather than the gifted puppetmaster with a vision as he may have seemed before.  Each shot, stunningly photographed by Robert Elswit, has a beautiful directness which recalls the glory days of Hollywood studio epics.<br /><br />Thematically, "There Will Be Blood" recalls one classic in particular: John Huston's "Treasure of the Sierra Madre."  Huston's dark masterpiece, which revolved around two beggars who wind up a trip to Mexico and discover a wealth of gold in the hills, has a lot in common with Anderson's own bleak masterpiece.  Both portray the corruption of the human soul as inevitable, although "Blood" is a little less harsh in its delivery of the statement.  At the start of each film, audiences are allowed the tiniest bit of hope, which is gradually squeezed until there is nothing left to do but submit to this frightening vision of humanity.  Lastly, both films end on a comic note, albeit a blood-stained note for Anderson's film.  He's said that he watched "Treasure of the Sierra Madre" every night during production before going to bed.  Suffice to say it shows.<br /><br />As far as editing goes, "There Will Be Blood" owes a lot to the taut, scene-into-scene style of Stanley Kubrick, particularly "The Shining."  "Blood" is edited by Dylan Tichenor, who also edited "Boogie Nights" and "Magnolia."  "Boogie Nights"' pacing recalled the work of Martin Scorsese, while "Magnolia" moved with the frenetic pacing of an Altman movie on crack.  Anderson's last picture, 2002's "Punch-Drunk Love," is among the most lush, dreamy movies in recent memory; that film's editing was smooth and breezy.  Even the most astute moviegoer would have a hard time believing that the same man who brought you the film where Adam Sandler acts or the movie where the sky rains frogs has now brought us this hulking, somber reflection on the human spirit.<br /><br />One final note: the score is composed by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood.  As one might expect, it's a bit of an oddity, which makes it all the more fitting for a movie like this.  It is certainly among the most sparse film scores in history, but its unusual instrumentation renders it one of the more interesting and potent soundtracks of the new millennium.<br /><br />Just how good is "There Will Be Blood"?  It's good enough to drink the milkshake of any other movie released this decade.  It is the finest film of 2007, surpassing even the Coens' extraodinary "No Country for Old Men" - but better still, it's one of the best movies ever made.  Very, very few films this century have come near this level of greatness - in fact, only Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" trilogy comes to mind.  "There Will Be Blood" is a film which makes a powerful statement through powerful filmmaking.  Its performances are peerless, its photography is beautiful and direct, its editing is classically tight, and its direction - well, P. T. Anderson may not be Scorsese or Coppola yet, but by god, he's on his way.</p></br><a href="../users/A10E3F50DIUJEE.html">A10E3F50DIUJEE</a><br/><p>I really feel this movie, although it could be slow at times, was quite good.  The acting was great, the cinematography was just stunning, and the story was compelling.<br /><br />The last 30 minutes of the film are my favorite--so intense!<br /><br />I realize this is not a "blockbuster" movie where everyone could easily enjoy it.  But if you like Paul Thomas Anderson, this movie will please you.  If you haven't seen this movie (or his other films), I advise you to rent it before you buy it, and keep an open mind.<br /><br />Sadly the greeting card style "case" (using that term kindly) was flimsy and I needed to get another plastic case so the DVD would not become damaged.  But that is my only complaint.  (*Note, I did NOT buy the special edition.)</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>This is an elegant, beautifully-filmed, brilliantly-scored and intensely acted cinematic experience... ...that left me completely nonplussed and apathetic by the time it finished.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis is really the only actor in this who's either A: on-screen for enough of the movie to make an impact, and/or B: talented enough to make a great performance out of a straightforward set of dialogue. It's not that his supporting cast isn't very, very good - it is - but this film, intentionally or no, ends up as a huge Star Vehicle for Day-Lewis' finely honed thesp skills, and he is excellent as a kind of Charles Foster Kane-meets-J.R. Ewing. Actually, the megalomaniacal leanings of Daniel Plainview are so total and so well-crafted that it's astonishing that we might feel any sympathy for him at all: but thanks to Day-Lewis' skill in the role, he doesn't wind up as a boring bad guy.<br /><br />For which the audience should be very, very grateful: Daniel Plainview is in probably 90% of this film's frames. Although sometimes this does get a little... ...well, more on that later.<br /><br />The direction is superlative and the cinematography, exquisite: Paul Thomas Anderson and director of photography Robert Elswitt have done a wonderful job of visualising the maddening disquiet of Plainview's greed against a barren, unforgiving environment.<br /><br />And the music and sound direction are wonderful, too - this movie uses silence as a sound to great effect for the first thirty minutes or so, and the discord created between lush orchestral movements and harsh, hard-to-hear air raid sirens further the audience's connection with the unusual, unpleasant actions and circumstances of the Plainview family.<br /><br />So why only three stars? For me, "There Will Be Blood" was like eating an entire table full of chocolate cakes in one sitting: sure, they're gorgeous and appealing and made to tempt the consumer - but a whole table full is just too rich and you wind up sick and bored. The relentless intensity of "There Will Be Blood" doesn't allow the audience to catch its breath at all, and while the acting and production are all excellent, the monotony of the film's intense tone doesn't let us assimilate what we've seen. We're constantly assaulted with more Very Serious Acting, more Very Meaningful Imagery, more Terribly Important Cinema - and "There Will Be Blood", at a hefty running time of 158 minutes, asks too much of its audience in trying to stay engaged with all this high-octane one-note relentless Cinematic Wonderfulness.<br /><br />That said, it's still a powerful, brilliant bit of cinema: I just didn't care to see more of it after the one hundred minute mark. Somehow, for me, it's less than the sum of its parts - even if its parts are incredible.</p></br><a href="../users/A6FIAB28IS79.html">A6FIAB28IS79</a><br/><p>The acting, the settings, the cinematography, the uncompromising editing (rejecting the familiar shot/reverse shot relay in favor of long takes), the spectacular scene of a fiery oil strike (recalling the air strike in "Apocalypse Now"), the nuanced richness of the film score, the tour-de-force performance of Day-Lewis (perhaps only Orson Welles' Kane compares) require that anyone who is the least bit serious about film make this experience a top priority.  But the end of this disturbing spectacle doesn't produce the catharsis of either a "Citizen Kane" (whose protagonist has at least an intimation of the truth, i.e. Rosebud) or an "Oedipus Rex" (whose protagonist not only eventually acquires self-knowledge but acts on it), and for that reason I'm withholding a star.<br /><br />But there's yet another reason to have some reservations.  Films that are ultimately the most powerful and enduring are those that put the verisimilitude of "everyday life" first and foremost, leaving the deeper allegorical implications to those who choose to pursue them.  At the half-way point, "There Will Be Blood" takes a surrealistic turn, and more than likely many spectators who have begun this lengthy film (with Lewis dominating every shot and scene save one) will tune out.  It's even more likely that most casual spectators will, at the end of this seemingly out-of-control scenario, simply breathe a sigh of relief that it's over and dismiss the whole business as wild and wacky, crazy stuff.<br /><br />Still, this is a viewing experience that can only strengthen its grip on reflective spectators.  Now that I've seen the film, it's become rooted in consciousness much like a Faulkner novel, in which a single character (named Compson or Sutpen) comes to represent an entire culture, from its idealistic, heroic and noble beginnings to its delusional and narcissistic, pathetic and decadent end (Faulkner's thunderous "Absalom! Absalom!" is the modern prototype).  You will see no blood in this film.  That would require a character capable of forgiving and being forgiven, of loving and being loved, of being not merely the sole god of his universe (who abandons his son, after denying that he's even begotten him) but the lamb, willing to sacrifice himself for others and able to function as a member of a human family whose bonds are not merely the artificial ones based on greed, radical individualism, and unrelenting competitiveness.  Instead, we are left with the certainty that the ambition and arrogance we have witnessed can only beget more needless destruction of human life.  In that sense, there indeed will be blood.<br /><br />Yes, the movie is especially relevant to our present political-economic situation (toward the end of the film a character makes reference to a bad "economy"--and the year is 1927, 2 years before 1929--or, if you prefer, 2009).  But it hits even deeper and closer to home than the culture surrounding us.  It doesn't require a lot of soul-searching to see the protagonist as a symbol, or magnified reflection, of one's own selfish journey in life.  The discovery is more than a little disturbing, exposing the wounds of ethnic pride, family insularity and, above all, the constant denial and prideful isolation practiced by the willful self.  Nonetheless, the film ultimately falls short of the balance between "pity and fear" that Aristotle required of great tragedy.  Daniel Day-Lewis's character is obviously fatally flawed if not hubris personified  (also part of the Aristotelian definition), and that's a pity of immense proportions--but no more.<br /><br />[Later: This is a film that continues to play itself out long after the final scene. It's occurred to me that there is, after all, a hint of redemptive blood-- not in the protagonist but his son.  The early shots of the child as a baby are sufficient proof to this viewer that Daniel Plainview is (despite his final disclaimer that he adopted the child merely as a sales gimmick) the boy's father.  The spectator's "reward," or epiphany, occurs when, for a fractional moment at the end, we see the "deaf-mute" son respond to his father's voice.  That moment tells us that the son has deliberately chosen an indirect, defensive route of communicating with a non-communicative father, wisely (as it turns out) hedging his bets should the father prove adamant and unyielding in his bloodless inhumanity.  The son, not the father, has seen to the completion of the "Abraham-Isaac" story, an archetypal drama that offers hope for a future in which  the son, rather than repeat the sins of the father, acquires an identity of his own.]</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>This will not be everyone's cup of tea, and considering the subject matter, I did not think this film would be mine either but thanks to some creative work from the writers and director, and a perfected performance from Daniel Day-Lewis, There Will Be Blood was a pleasant joy ride of entertainment.<br /><br />The film begins with music one would expect to hear out of a horror film, while the director has us gazing across a desert on a sunny day, in the western U.S.  The music is erie and perhaps grants us immidiate forshadowing of what is to come throughout the film.  I did not realize it at first, but there is no spoken dialouge for the first 15 minutes of the film...I practically jumped when the first words came across, as the 15 minutes of spoken silence where quite effective, giving us an insiders look at the stages of extracting oil in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<br /><br />Daniel Plainview's persistence pays off, as his oil business steadily grows and expands, while raising his young son in the early 20th century.  From the get-go, Daniel is not the nicest or most honest man around, and any gentlemenship he displays is out of business rather than kindness.  For awhile we only know the business side of Daniel, yet desire to know more, which eventually comes around but not until later on in the film.  The desire to understand this man more kept a certain suspense going.  Things are fairly calm throughout the first hour of the film, and you expect (even hope) for something to go wrong to make things interesting.  They do, certain tragedies strike and tensions build, primarily between Daniel and Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), the leader of the local church.  The deeper meaning of the story begins to unfold, when we discover the villainous (in his own ways) Plainview and Sunday are more alike than different as would like to believe.<br /><br />Though the film has it's moments and messages that are interesting and make a point, it's the performance of Day-Lewis that is unforgettable and make this film sharp.  He brings all the right elements as a perfected actor should, allowing the role to come alive as if it were the very real thing.<br /><br />Acting - 5<br />Characters - 4<br />Drama - 4<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4</p></br><a href="../users/AY46DEOJJYFTW.html">AY46DEOJJYFTW</a><br/><p>Daniel Day Lewis is incredible even though I found myself thinking about that character he played in GANGS of NEW YORK at times and I absolutely love Paul Thomas Anderson films.

But the key to this film really is Day-Lewis' performance and the whole film rests on his portrayal of Daniel Plainview, never has a film rested so strongly on one actors supreme work. This film doesn't have any real resolution, although some parts are tied up, but this looks at the overall life of this brutal and savage man as he exploits both community and nature for his gains in oil. At 2 and 1/2 hours it did begin to feel a touch long towards the end, but Day-Lewis manages to hold you captivated by his rich and in-depth performance and keeps you watching until the very end. The supporting actors play their roles well and Plainviews son was especially note-worthy.

With the exception of rare moments of affection for his deaf son, whose deafness is caused by an accident at his father's oil wells, Plainview cares for no one on earth, hates most people, is highly competitive and filled with unstoppable greed and ambition.<br /><br />The film is based on a novel by Upton Sinclair OIL and is set in the early decades of the 20th century when a lot of Americans acted like Plainview-- to a lesser degree we hope-- in their quest for wealth at whatever expense.<br /><br />The critics could not get enough of this film. Daniel Day-Lewis earned an Oscar for best actor for his portrayal of Plainview. While he is supported by good performances by other actors, notably that of Paul Dano ("Little Miss Sunshine") as the hell-fire minister of the Church of the Third Revelation, Eli Sunday, the film ultimately belongs to Day-Lewis.<br /><br />In addition to his statement about greed, Anderson also shoots a nice arrow into fundamentalist, crazy religion.

He searches for it, buys, cheats, or steals the land where he finds it, and then he drills for it. He has little patience for human realations, but sees everything as a magnificent struggle, with the land, with the oil, with the workers he must hire to drill for it. You wouldn't like this man, but you'd respect, or at the very least, fear him. He is like a force of nature, and only pretends to have normal human feelings in order to negotiate a better deal when he is buying, cheating, or stealing land on which to drill for oil. Daniel Day-Lewis has really thrown himself into the role, and he aims to play the role to the hilt, without caring at all about the audience liking his character. In fact, the less you like him, the better he is doing his job. But it can be lonely, and when he thinks he has found a long lost brother, Henry Brand (Kevin J. O'Connor), he confesses his feelings:<br /><br />Daniel Plainview: I see the worst in people. I don't need to look past seeing them to get all I need. I've built my hatreds up over the years, little by little, Henry... to have you here gives me a second breath.

I am a sinner!<br />Plainview: I am a sinner.<br />Eli Sunday: I am sorry Lord!<br />Plainview: I am sorry Lord.<br />Eli Sunday: I want the blood!<br />Plainview: I want the blood.<br />Eli Sunday: You have abandoned your child!<br />Plainview: I have abandoned my child.<br />Eli Sunday: I will never backslide!<br />Plainview: I will never backslide.<br />Eli Sunday: I was lost, but now I am found!<br />Plainview: I was lost but now I'm found.<br />Eli Sunday: I have abandoned my child!<br />[Plainview glares at him]<br />Eli Sunday: Say it... say it!<br />[Plainview mumbles]<br />Eli Sunday: Say it louder... say it louder!<br />Plainview: I've abandoned my child! I've abandoned my child! I've abandoned my boy!<br /><br />The Sunday farm is only fit for growing weeds, and raising goats. The soil is alkaline, and the water is salty but there is oil. The only problem for Eli is that his brother Paul Sunday (also played by Paul Dano in a dual role) has already sold the land to Plainview.<br /><br />Eli Sunday: Daniel, I'm asking if you'd like to have business with the Church of the Third Revelation in developing this lease on young Bandy's thousand acre tract. I'm offering you to drill on one of the great undeveloped fields of Little Boston!<br />Plainview: I'd be happy to work with you.<br />Eli Sunday: You would? Yes, yes, of course. Wonderful.<br />Plainview: But there is one condition for this work.<br />Eli Sunday: All right.<br />Plainview: I'd like you to tell me that you are a false prophet... I'd like you to tell me that you are, and have been, a false prophet... and that God is a superstition.<br />Eli Sunday: ...but that's a lie... it's a lie, I cannot say it.<br />[long pause]<br />Eli Sunday: When can we begin to drill?<br />Plainview: Right away.<br />Eli Sunday: How long will it take to bring in the well?<br />Plainview: Should be very quick.<br />Eli Sunday: I would like a one hundred thousand dollar signing bonus plus the five that is owed with interest.<br />Plainview: That's only fair.<br />Eli Sunday: I am a false prophet and God is a superstition. If that's what you believe, then I will say it.<br />Plainview: Say it like you mean it.<br />Eli Sunday: Daniel...<br />Plainview: Say it like it's your sermon.<br />Eli Sunday: This is foolish.<br />[long pause]<br />Eli Sunday: I am a false prophet! God is a superstition! I am a false prophet! God is a superstition! I am a false prophet! God is a superstition!<br />[pause]<br />Eli Sunday: Is that fine?<br />Plainview: Those areas have been drilled.<br />Eli Sunday: What?<br />Plainview: Those areas have been drilled.<br />Eli Sunday: ...no they haven't...<br />Plainview: It's called drainage. I own everything around it... so I get everything underneath it.<br />Eli Sunday: But there are no derricks there. This is the Bandy tract. Do you understand?<br />Plainview: Do you? I drink your water, Eli. I drink it up. Everyday. I drink the blood of lamb from Bandy's tract.<br /><br />[How can this be? Plainview is really taking delight in turning the tables on the 'false prophet.']<br /><br />Plainview: Drainage! Drainage, Eli, you boy. Drained dry. I'm so sorry. Here, if you have a milkshake, and I have a milkshake, and I have a straw. There it is, that's a straw, you see? You watching?. And my straw reaches acroooooooss the room, and starts to drink your milkshake... I... drink... your... milkshake!<br />[sucking sound]<br />Plainview: I drink it up!<br /><br />There Will Be Blood is a tour de force performance from Daniel Day-Lewis. You might not like the character he is playing, but you have to admit that he is totally commited to that character, and matches Plainview's intensity, pound for pound, every second he is onscreen.<br /><br />The cinematography and settings are magnificent. The composer of the film's music was Jonny Greenwood, primarily famous as the guitarist for the British rock band Radiohead. There is some Brahms and music from other composers, but the bulk of the music was by Greenwood, and it really adds to the epic granduer. This is an epic of man against nature. There are long stretches where there is no dialogue at all, just man battling against nature, struggling and striving to pump that oil out of the ground. Living in Bakersfield, an oil town, I see oil derricks all around me. Some of the action takes place right here, for instance, scenes were shot in Santa Clarita, and they talk of a pipeline through the Tehachapi Mountains. That is right down Kern Canyon. We have a Kern County Oil Museum, and other historic sights in Taft. All that history is right around us, and it made me curious about how they got all the oil pumping. There Will Be Blood tells that story very well.<br /><br />TEN PIVOTAL ROLES OF DANIEL DAY-LEWIS<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKN9">Gangs of New York (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a> (2002) ....

The musical score -- an impressionistic mix of half-musical screeches and mechanical noises -- was an overpowering presence throughout the film. So much so that its occasional absence was jarring and unnerving. "There Will Be Blood" features a tour de force performance by Daniel Day Lewis as the monomaniacal oilman Daniel Plainview -- a man whose singleness of vision matches his surname. Indeed, Plainview has but one aim -- to become wealthy beyond imagining, to work devilishly hard to get there and to let absolutely nothing get in the way of his dream. Plainview is the epitome of the American character -- driven, relentless, brutal and dismissive of societal niceties, except insofar as they help him achieve his aims. His chief antagonist is Eli Sunday, the preacher son of a poor farmer. Sunday and Plainview each seek their own means to riches, and quickly become locked in a vicious pas-de-deux. Sunday needs Plainview to finance his church; Plainview needs Sunday's approbation to persuade his congregation to cooperate in his ventures. The tension between these two men becomes so overwhelming at times that I started to wonder whether there was an allegorical element going on -- religion v business -- or perhaps a commentary about the unholy alliance between commerce and the Cross in American culture.<br /><br />But TWBB is extraordinary on so many levels. The acting is superb. DDL molds his character into a natural force. His growling voice, perpetually sweaty face and cold eyes convey menace even when expressing the most banal of sentiments. The writing is phenomenal; the recreation of the turn-of-the-century Southwest is more than a little convincing. The depiction of the early, grueling methods of extracting oil from the ground is fascinating. The plotting never gives away the story arc, as periods of intensity and frenetic action are juxtaposed unpredictably against periods of reflection and preternatural quiet. There are many star performance in the film, but aside from DDL, kudos go to Dillon Freasier as Plainview's young, laconic son, H.W. "There Will Be Blood" is a masterpiece, an original, and tremendous ride through one man's personal obsession to succeed.</p></br><a href="../users/AS558SNWF1DXG.html">AS558SNWF1DXG</a><br/><p>I'm a huge P.T. Anderson fan and, of course, was very excited when -- years after "Punch-Drunk Love" -- he reappeared with a new movie: "There Will Be Blood," a two-and-a-half hour epic about oil prospectors at the turn of the century. I saw it the day it opened.<br /><br />On my first viewing, though, I didn't know what I thought. I respected the film. I thought Day-Lewis was amazing. I knew it was a daring, challenging effort. But I didn't know if I actually liked it, especially that crazy ending. The whole thing seemed to contain very little of the P.T.A. that I liked so much.<br /><br />I was so perplexed I went back and saw it again. And that's when it really affected me. That's when certain sequences -- an oil fire, a speech about schools and bread, even just the sight of a drifting cloud shading a desert camp, a dab of oil on a baby's forehead or the shapes of oil wells sprung up on the horizon -- became profoundly, inescapably moving.<br /><br />This is a movie so rich and deliberate and limestone-dense that knowing what will happen in the end actually sharpens its impact. It's in a second viewing that one can fully appreciate the characterization Daniel Day-Lewis brings to the role of Plainview.<br /><br />But other elements are just as strong or very nearly -- young Dillon Freasier, who had not acted before, is astonishingly potent as Plainview's mostly silent son; Kevin J. O'Connor uncannily mirrors and converses Day-Lewis' characterization; Ciaran Hinds does a lot with very little as Fletcher Hamilton, Plainview's tough but watchful and subtly tender right-hand-man. And much was written about the abrasive edges of Jonny Greenwood's string-heavy score, but it's impossible to listen to a piece like, for example, "Prospector Arrives" and not be moved; he's created a rarity of a score -- music that's absolutely inseparable from the film, and almost seems to have been created simultaneously with the direction.<br /><br />The movie's biggest talent, however, is Anderson. Many directors have lately tried to channel Terrence Malick (for example "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" which is a beautiful, haunting movie -- but really not much more than a gorgeous ode to "Days of Heaven"). Anderson does evoke Malick, but he incorporates enough of his own style and voice that the film transcends imitation and becomes something else entirely -- possibly something greater even than Malick's own films.<br /><br />---<br /><br />The double-disk DVD is taking flack for not offering a wealth of material. But I think it's a fine, handsomely presented package. I think the extra disk offers just enough background on the film without giving away everything.<br /><br />A slideshow and through a 1923 documentary, "The Story of Petroleum," offers many of the sources and much of the inspiration behind much of the movie, beyond what was drawn from Upton Sinclair's novel, "Oil!"<br /><br />A fine deleted scene, "Fishing," shows us that -- contrary to what Plainview tells a crowd early in the film -- he occasionally DOES lose his tools down the hole and has to spend weeks fishing for them. The scene is great to see -- and sheds a lot of light on the relationship between Daniel and Eli's father -- but it would've interrupted the flow of the final narrative, and I'm glad it wasn't in the final cut.<br /><br />I'm also glad there's no alternate audio track. Yes, P.T.A. gives some of the most interesting commentary around, but I honestly appreciate that he's leaving hidden some of the mysteries hidden behind this strange and wonderful and beautiful film. It's not for everyone, I realize, but I think it's the best movie of this year and last year and possibly the year before that. It just took me a second viewing to figure that out.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Upton Sinclair's epic novel OIL! has been successfully transformed to a film by screen writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson ('Magnolia','Boogie Nights', etc). The film is a long song (158 minutes), covering a fascinating span of time in turn of the century California when oil gained the lure of gold and transformed the land and the people into creatures of capitalism and greed and lust, and were it not for the presence of Daniel Day-Lewis' powerful performance as the man who makes it all happen, the story itself would become tiresome.  It doesn't.<br /><br />Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a silver miner in 1898, but soon discovers oil and begins on a mission to become wealthy, owning most of the oil fields from the mountains of central California to the Pacific Ocean. With his medicine man manner of getting people to do what he wants he pursues his greed relentlessly, disrupting small sleepy towns like Little Boston as he gains access to the wealth of the black gold.  There are odd characters along the way, such as the evangelist Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) who become crushable clods beneath Plainview's boots. The progress of the story is well known to most: it is the telling of the tale in the hands of wholly credible, completely physically immersed Daniel Day-Lewis that makes the story seem new.<br /><br />The film's grimy atmosphere is well presented in Robert Elswit's cinematography and the odd musical score by Jonny Greenwood is as ominous as the vantage of Plainview. Greenwood elects to weave classical works into the fabric of the film: when young HW falls deaf after an explosion the silence is partnered by one of Arv&ouml; P&auml;rt's 'Fratres', and the film's credits are displayed over the Anne-Sophie Mutter/von Karajan recording of Brahms' Violin Concerto. Strange bedfellows, yes, but entirely appropriate to the overall mood of the film. The journey is long and depressing, but the power of Day-Lewis' performance is magic.  Grady Harp, April 08</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>When is a "Collector's Edition" not a collector's edition? When the second disc barely has an one hour's worth of additional featurettes and other extras. "There Will Be Blood" deserved to be recognized as one of the finest films from last year. That's not to say the film is perfect but its flaws are pretty easy to overlook because of Paul Thomas Anderson's sweeping and ambitious storytelling. I'd recommend the single disc edition as the "Collector's Edition" doesn't have all that much in the way of extras. The single disc edition is really all you need even though it doesn't have ANY extras.<br /><br />The packaging for this set is horrible (which I could forgive if the discs weren't scratched up in the process). How did this get past the marketing department at Paramount?<br /><br />"There Will Be Blood" based on Upton Sinclair's novel OIL! gives us two portraits of two very different men both ruled by their own obsession--Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis in his Oscar winning role who seems to be channeling John Huston from the film "Chinatown")an oil man who in spite of his impressive skills as a smooth talking salesman, doesn't like people very much (aside from his son H.W. which he uses to help sell people that his is "a family business") and Eli Sunday (Paul Dano)a smooth talking healer and leader of the Church of the Third Relevation. Both men want wealth and power for Plainview its a means to escape. While Sunday sees the oil leaking out of the ground of his father's ranch to gather a flock, reach out with his message and, in turn, gain the power that he believes he deserves. The two men don't get along from the moment they meet--Eli is on to Daniel's "plain speaking" way of doing business and getting something for next to nothing and Daniel believes that Eli is a charlatan. In their own way each is a hard nosed uncompromising businessman with visions that don't mesh.<br /><br />The DVD:<br /><br />Robert Elswit's cinematography deservedly won an Oscar for the film and while the DVD transfer looks good, the night sequences are a bit murky and dark. Detail overall is pretty good with a color scheme that accurately captures the theatrical look of the film.<br /><br />Audio sounds terrific nicely reproducing Johnny Greenwood's score.<br /><br />There are no extras on the first disc which has a menu as plain as Daniel's view of the world. The second disc features a vintage silent featurette that runs about 27 minutes and uses Greenwood's score to accompany it. It tells the "story" of oil and shows us how oilmen hunted for it and brought it to market.<br /><br />We also get "15 Minutes" a collection of vintage stills from the era taken around oil sites, behind-the-scenes footage and various clips showing all the work that Anderson and his crew put into researching the film. It's a silent segment accompanied by music and lasts, yep, just over 15 minutes.<br /><br />Next up we two deleted scenes that last nearly ten minutes. Under three minutes "Dallies Gone Wild" is an alternate take of the restaurant scene involving Daniel, his son H.W. and employees of Standard Oil.<br /><br />We also get the teaser for the film and the original theatrical trailer both of which remind me of the lost art of crafting a great trailer that will pull in an audience without giving away too much. All things considered, this is a disappointing "Collector's Edition" even with the awkward collectable packaging that is included (where the discs slide inside) and would be prone to damage with time.<br /><br />Conclusion: A powerful, terrific film and one of the ten best from 2007, "There Will Be Blood" appears in a disappointing special edition from Paramount. The film looks fine and the soundtrack is brilliantly rendered which should be enough to get fans to purchase the single disc DVD and that's what I would recommend.<br /><br />The extras on disc two of the "Collector's Edition" are slim pickings to say the least. It's as if Paramount rushed to pull this material together in light of the Academy Award nominations and wins the film scored. They are very disappointing for a two disc edition and I can't strongly recommend the two disc edition based on this. If you just want the film, go for the single disc edition and wait to see what the Blu-ray comes packs in the way of special features.<br /><br />A reminder...Voting at amazon.com is about whether or not the review helped you decide to purchase the product NOT about whether or not you agree with the reviewer.

Day-Lewis' resonant voice is a potent magnet. It evokes the deceptively dulcet tones of John Huston in Chinatown, charm slathered over wolfish perversity, the better to cheat you with, my dear." Peter Travers<br /><br />In the first few minutes after the final moments of this film, I sat in silence. I felt like I had been punched in the belly, the impact of this film and the performance by Daniel Day-Lewis is monumental. Daniel Plainview, is a man who was scratching for a living in the beginning of teh 1900's. He scratched for silver at first and developed a bum leg after falling down a mine. He moved on to oil and after striking an oil well he moved on to become an oil tycoon. At this time he adopted a young boy he named HW. This boy became the love of Plainview's life, and the only tender moments we see are with HW. Plainview's nemesis is Eli Sunday, a preacher in the Evangelical mode. He and Plainview get under each other's skin, and the true embarrassments in life that both feel occur because of the other. Each of them are preaching a sermon the other has no belief in.<br /><br />Plainview also meets a brother with whom he feels close and is able to share his inner feeling until the day that he discovers a truth that changes things forever. Daniel Plainview is a man like no other, he represents to us the dark, the evil of power that enfolds someone in the grip of living a life that does not bother with human relationships. Plainview told his brother,"I look at people and I see nothing worth liking."<br /><br />From the opening scenes of darkness and strife until the final scene that will cut to your core, we sit enmeshed in this story, this film. Paul Anderson, the director has more than a memorable film, it is a monument to the epitome of film making.  I could find nothing to criticize in this film. It will long be remembered as a masterpiece.  From the musical score to the photography to the actors all, everyone and everything is perfect.<br /><br />Highly, Highly, Highly Recommended. prisrob 04-11-08<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783227906">In the Name of the Father</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PAAJYW">Magnolia</a></p></br><a href="../users/A2GA2SO3YK6CXI.html">A2GA2SO3YK6CXI</a><br/><p>We acquired this movie because it had won several awards and the main character is played by one of our favorite stars, Daniel Day-Lewis, but as the movie unfolds, we found ourselves disappointed by the film. While the performances are excellent and the story a clear indication of where ambition, corruption and big business, specially the oil industry can take individual passions, the lack of humanity of some of these individuals is simply abhorrent.<br /><br />The film delves into the beginnings of the oil industry in the United States, seen through the life of a self made oilman by the name of Daniel Plainview, masterfully played by Daniel Day-Lewis. He travels the country identifying opportunities where to buy land that yields black gold, oil, to gain power, wealth and status.<br /><br />It is during the early part of the 20th century and we get the impression that the process was brutal, without regard to the cost of human life and at times with dire consequences for the families that lived on the land where oil was found.<br /><br />The movie confronts religion and family values against capitalism and the acquisition of power, and it is terrible to see how a young man who claims to be a prophet forces Daniel Plainview to accept religion in exchange for land where to build a pipe line, later paying back by having to renounce his beliefs in exchange for money to cover debts resulting from the market crash that leaves him penniless.<br /><br />Not a movie I will see again... anytime soon.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Paul Thomas Anderson ("Boogie Nights") has created a grim, powerful masterpiece of a film with "There Will Be Blood."  I'm not sure when I'll want to watch it again - it may be years - but eventually I will dive back in to this stark portrayal of one man's drive for the American Dream.<br /><br />Daniel Day Lewis plays Daniel Plainview and gives one of his trademark pitch-perfect, scary performances.  Plainview is essentially an ogre, desperate to sate his own appetites and more than willing to crush any mere human who crosses his path.<br /><br />Indeed, we first see Plainview hacking out a living in a silver mine, living in solitary desolation almost like a fabled monster in a cave.  Plainview's the kind of guy who considers a shattered leg worthy of a grunt or two, but not a real impediment to success - we see this in some brutal early scenes.<br /><br />But eventually Plainview becomes an oilman, willing to risk it all to find Wealth in the ground.  And why?  So he can get enough money so he can avoid human contact of any kind, a la Howard Hughes.<br /><br />This is a strange, powerful film.  A harsh soundtrack, a bleak landscape, and a cast filled with strong men playing for keeps in an unforgiving world combine to make this a chilling, riveting masterpiece. "I drink your milkshake!" is destined to go down as one of the great catch-phrases of cinema, perhaps the ultimate bit of trash-talk.<br /><br />Look for powerful performances throughout the film, although to be fair women don't get much chance to shine here.  Lewis is stellar, as always, but Paul Dano ("Little Miss Sunshine") really surprises as the twin boys Paul and Eli Sunday - the latter gets one of the most bizarre and horrifying story arcs in recent memory.  I'm not sure how many times these two actors shot the controversial final scene, but I hope for their sakes they filmed the rehearsal.<br /><br />A great, powerful, jarring film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis), a man filled with hatred and disdain for the human race, spends his life sucking oil from the ground and amassing a fortune.  His power and wealth allow him to look down on the rest of humanity, but cannot protect him from his own self-contempt.<br /><br />Paul Thomas Anderson's epic film is a deeply cynical meditation on two forces that defined the rise of America, entrepreneurialism and religion.  It features great performances and a magnificent evocation of the oil fields of the West during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  There are many fascinating aspects of this film, but the most interesting may be Plainview's lifelong enmity toward the charismatic preacher Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), whose flock represents for Plainview all that is gullible and foolish in people.  The two men humiliate each other in several remarkable scenes, most notably the one in which Plainview is coerced into joining the church in order to gain some land rights; it's a tour de force performance from Day Lewis.  Jonny Greenwood's extraordinary, unique soundtrack is unexpected but totally appropriate.  I'm sure that this rich film will reward many repeat viewings.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>For a while, I thought the arc of this movie was going to parallel the classic "Citizen Kane" trajectory, with Daniel Day-Lewis' character rising from humble beginnings and snatched opportunities as an oil well rigger - to a hollow, rattling, rambling millionaire alone amidst his riches. However, just as I thought I had the character's conclusion pegged that way, the movie made another catapult into new territory.<br /><br />Everything about this movie proceeds by jagged, akimbo grasshopper leaps, like the ones that might be made by the giant grasshopper-like well pumps that dominate the film's landscapes. "Blood" has a distinctive beat to its plot - just as its score has a distinctive beat marked by industrial clanks and crunches.<br /><br />The plot is loosely based on Upton Sinclair's book, "Oil," exposing the greed and chicanery rampant in the oil mining industry. However where Sinclair's book made the protagonist's adversaries a consortium of industrialists - this movie made Lewis' main adversaries a group of religious fundamentalists. That was a daring choice, but it does give the action another dimension.<br /><br />Paul Dano is superb as the two-faced religious leader - so smooth and passively faith-basted on the one hand - so much the raging tyrant on the other. However Daniel Day-Lewis brings in the tour de force performance as oilman extraordinaire. This is a memorable film on all scores.</p></br><a href="../users/A1T3O2LILVK0C4.html">A1T3O2LILVK0C4</a><br/><p>Paul Thomas Anderson's film adaptation of Upton Sinclair's novel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143112260">Oil!</a> is a somber masterpiece. There Will Be Blood is a fascinating examination of mankind's descent into madness, greed and zealotry. But rather than being heavy-handed or pretentious, the film is subtle, ironic and darkly humorous. It's not often that you see an American film that so skillfully balances these themes without being tainted by political partiality. Nor has there been a film in recent years that so rightly caused controversy. And yet I challenge anyone to watch this film and not be affected by it... or to forget it.<br /><br />As viewers, we are first introduced to Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) while he's working as a miner in 1898. Soon after his interests turn to oil. From the onset we can see that he is a single-minded, determined man of an unusual nature. His main concern in life isn't himself, or his workers, or even his own son. His only care is his business and even that he pursues with seeming indifference. Daniel is not an emotive individual. He's coldly ambitious and the only evidence of his feeling human emotion at all is his explosive anger. But Daniel hides his temperament from the people he scams. He uses his son as a mascot, promoting a fabricated image of a family run business. He unrelentingly pursues landowners with a confidence that borders on egomaniacal. Still, he isn't a monster... yet. When a young man named Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) claims that his family farm has oil that seeps through the ground, Daniel is at first skeptical of a man who appears so earnest. Paul intends to be paid for his information and he doesn't care if his family loses money to Plainview. This suits Daniel well (opportunism and industry went hand in hand in the early 20th century). Daniel and his son, H.W. arrive in Paul's small town where they meet the Sunday family. Their son Eli, Paul's identical twin brother, is a preacher of a fanatical Evangelist cult and he's reluctant to allow his family to sell their land to Daniel. He can see that Daniel is a successful man and that he may be able to profit from Daniel's keen sense of business. The pairing of these two men, both dangerously greedy and prideful, leads to a dramatic confrontation. Eli says that God will curse the oil well unless Daniel pays tribute to the church and allows Eli to bless the derrick. When Daniel dismisses Eli disaster strikes and H.W. suffers the consequences. Before long a stranger shows up in town declaring that he's Daniel's long lost brother. But he is not what he seems and Daniel's discovery of this brings him to the precipice of insanity and pushes him over the edge. His combined guilt for his mistakes with H.W., his all-consuming hatred of Eli and his blind ambition lead him to a horrific finale. The last scene of the film is an electrifying and unsettling culmination of one man's journey into madness.<br /><br />This film isn't for everyone. I loved it but I enjoy stories told from the dark depths of the human psyche. The film isn't as violent as the title implies but it is shocking and disturbing. Paul Thomas Anderson has created a psychological epic chronicling two men's moral and mental disintegration. The style of the film reminds me of controversial director, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007CVSB">D.W. Griffith's silent historical melodramas</a> which explore similarly pessimistic views of life. Ultimately There Will Be Blood is a masterful exploration of two greatly flawed characters who are portrayed by immensely talented actors.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>This is, hands down, without a doubt, one of the strangest damn movies I have ever seen. Unsettling and weird and wonderful and fantastic.<br /><br />The plot is simple: a man, Daniel Plainview, steamrollers over everyone and everything in his path in order to get oil, and thereby, money and power. There's a great many comparisons that can be made between this character and Charles Foster Kane (and if you haven't seen <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9E">Citizen Kane (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, do so), the primary difference being that Kane at least was somewhat likable. The best you can say for Plainview is that he is, at times, pitiable.<br /><br />Mostly the movie is a character study, pitting Plainview against a young preacher, Eli Sunday. His church is called The Church of the Third Revelation, which if you're a smart-a$$ like me tells you everything you need to know about who he is and what he does. Suffice to say that in modern times he'd have big hair, a bad suit and the ability to cry/plead for money on cue whenever a TV camera is on him.<br /><br />It's very hard to describe this movie beyond what I've said, at least as far as the plot goes. The cinematography is mind-blowing and the music is... well, effective. There's a weird sound that plays over the soundtrack from time to time. It sounds rather like an air-raide siren if you only played out the first note of it and then didn't stop.<br /><br />It is one of the most memorable and effective films I've ever seen. It's very hard to watch at times, but entirely worth it, if for no other reason than Daniel Day-Lewis' performance.<br /><br />One last note: whomever thought this was a good idea for DVD packaging needs to be smacked, cause it totally isn't. Green, yes, but very stupid. Some sort of plastic to at least hold the discs in place would've been nice, but, oh, well.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CK0VXUDVXGMN.html">A2CK0VXUDVXGMN</a><br/><p>This was a quirky, sometimes difficult to understand expose of American greed and religious opportunity, flip sides of the same coin.  Still, the ending seemed contrived, overly symbolic and spoiled, for me anyway, an otherwise artistic, odd movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A328547P5BGZC.html">A328547P5BGZC</a><br/><p>I bought this 2 disc special edition when it came out.<br /><br />The movie wasn't quite the masterpiece that the critics claim.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis was outstanding as Daniel Plainfield, an oilman! He nailed the role and played the part to perfection.<br /><br />But the movie starts slow and is longer then need be and without alot of serious suspense or action, it never really grabbed me.<br /><br />As far as packaging, I wish they had used the plastic case, but instead opted to use a thin cardboard version. The future of dvd cases, yikes, I hope not.<br /><br />Overall, I would rate this movie a 7 out of 10!!</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>This film is almost three hours long, and there's not a word of dialogue for the first fifteen minutes, but I could barely believe it when the credits rolled. Based upon the novel Oil! (1927) by Upton Sinclair, the film is set in the wild California frontier at the end of the 19th and beginning of the early twentieth-centuries. Daniel Day-Lewis stars as Daniel Plainview, a silver miner who discovers crude oil on his land, and Paul Dano, who plays a preacher named Eli Sunday who sells rights to the oil on his family's property in order to help his church. Playview and Sunday become moral rivals, and thirty years later, at the end of the film, both characters have been deeply corrupted. Plainview goes mad, whereas Eli admits that he's a fake and God doesn't exist. In an important sub-plot, Plainview's adopted son lives under his father's very dark shadow, and declares at the end of the film, "I thank God I have none of you in me." Plainview's own last words are a confessional understatement: "I'm finished." Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, the film won two Academy Awards -- Best Actor for Day-Lewis and Best Cinematography for Robert Elswitt.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>"There Will Be Blood" - Paul Thomas Anderson's ambitious adaptation of Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel, "Oil" - runs for a good fifteen minutes before a single word is ever spoken.  Yet, that prolonged reticence is probably the least peculiar aspect of a movie that becomes progressively more bizarre the longer it goes on.<br /><br />In the role that won him an Oscar, Daniel Day-Lewis - who, with his stentorian tones, sounds as if he's channeling John Huston for large portions of the film - plays Daniel Plainview, an ambitious oil man in turn-of-the-century California who, in his ruthless quest for money and success, finds he has no room left over in his heart for either God or his fellow man.  Plainview's main antagonist is Eli Sunday, a fire-and-brimstone faith-healer who turns out to be every bit as opportunistic and empty-souled as the godless Plainview (and considerably more hypocritical).<br /><br />With two such unsavory and unsympathetic lead characters, Anderson really didn't have much choice but to go for the abstract in his approach, turning Sinclair's tale into an exercise in art house style that is as liable to alienate "general audience" viewers as pull them in.  Anderson is dealing with some mighty resonant themes here - greed, deception, abandonment, religion, filial relationships, Man's place in the universe - and he brings an appropriately "grand opera" sensibility to the film.  He lets Day-Lewis swing for the fences in his performance, resulting in a mesmerizing admixture of over-the-top histrionics and soul-searing subtlety.  Anderson has mounted the film in such a way as to make the visuals and the landscape as integral to the storyline as the characters - at times even more so, as the script frequently fails to sufficiently clarify the motives for why the characters do what they do.  Their actions often feel so arbitrary and inexplicable that we begin to wonder if crucial portions of the film might not have actually ended up on the cutting-room floor.  This is particularly the case in the later stretches of the movie as Plainview descends ever more into paranoia and madness.<br /><br />Paul Dano ("Little Miss Sunshine") and Dillon Freasier are both excellent as the callow preacher and Plainview's young son, H.W., respectively; and Robert Elswit's award-winning cinematography evokes the beauty of the setting without ever downplaying its bleakness.  Finally, Jonny Greenwood's haunting score nicely underlines the purple-prose nature of the piece.<br /><br />Alternately visionary and pretentious, "There Will Be Blood" may not be for all tastes and audience demographics, but its uniqueness, daring and style remind us of why many of us enjoy going to the movies in the first place.</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>...this is my least favorite Paul Thomas Anderson film (his others which were far, far better: Punch Drunk Love, Magnolia, Boogie Nights).  Technically, it's superb: cinematography, the always-stellar acting of Daniel Day Lewis, score, script, film editing, etc.  However it starts off VERY slow (no dialogue for first ten minutes) and never really picks up because the film is mainly a character study of the workaholic and rapacious oilman Daniel Plainview that DDL plays, yet without any clear antagonists or dramatic tension, other than Eli Sunday, a creepy small-town farmboy-cum-preacher who makes a series of feeble attempts to grab his own piece of the pie, and Plainview's adopted son HW who later becomes estranged from him.<br /><br />Due in large part to the title and to watching Plainview's ruthlessness and greed, I kept thinking this was going to be one of those "chickens coming home to roost" karmic tragedies where you see the main character build himself up obsessively and then, through his own inherent flaws, fall apart at the end.  Instead, Plainview merely plateaus into a kind of deeply entrenched and isolated state of evil by the end---still dominant and a bit more twisted and violent than before, but now an eccentric recluse sort of like Howard Hughes.<br /><br />After some thought it was clear to me that Anderson has made what is more or less a "message movie" very much in the spirit of Upton Sinclair: a full frontal assault on the two most cherished myths in American history---namely, that of the capitalist entrepreneur "self-made man," and of the church being a moral beacon and pillar of the community.  This film provides a blistering counterpoint: Daniel Plainview the oilman is a heartless, obsessive, one-dimensional workaholic who has neither scruples nor humanity; Eli Sunday the charismatic but hypocritical small-town preacher is equally ambitious, manipulative and ruthless but is at heart impotent and pathetic whenever confronted by Plainview directly, and finally destroyed (literally and figuratively) by Plainview at the end.  In other words, we are presented with a very dark vision of business making religion its whore, as much as religion wants to milk business but is too inept to succeed.  Plainview, as the embodiment of small entrepreneur allowed to grow into large scale industrial tycoon, is simply a psychotic beast who eats Sunday for lunch, right along with all the gullible, weak and passive common people (like Sunday's congregation, whose land he swindles from them) whom Plainview systematically deceives and exploits to make his fortune from though they imagine that they are following Sunday.<br /><br />As Phillip Roth wrote in The Human Stain, "Human history is a story of the ruthless and the defenseless."<br /><br />This is a subtle and hard to dispute social-historical analysis, which Anderson's film unfortunately does not do a very good job of communicating clear, in no small part because of how slow and monochromatic it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A109LWN9DUGPDP.html">A109LWN9DUGPDP</a><br/><p>Personlly I think this is the best movie I've seen in many years but this dvd release is one big joke...hahaha.The 2 disc and single disc are put in cardboard dvd holders which in turn totally scratches the dvds like nothing I've ever seen.I havn't wacthed this dvd yet but if I can get through it without a freeze or skip I will be shocked.Paramount/Miramax go sit on it you all really put it to us on this one I want a complete refund for one packaged properly.I've never been this dissapointed on a dvd release and I've been through alot of them.</p></br><a href="../users/A51IK68MWKV5R.html">A51IK68MWKV5R</a><br/><p>I went into There Will Be Blood expecting a solid movie, but nothing on the scale writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson delivers. I enjoyed Magnolia and especially Boogie Nights for various reasons (often despite their flaws), but in those films, Anderson seemed to be merely following the multiple-character trail Robert Altman blazed many years before. This film really feels like a truly original story by a much more mature storyteller.<br /><br />In addition to the terrific acting from star Daniel Day Lewis (and to a lesser extent, Paul Dano in a dual role), there were two major plusses about this movie. First, that I had no idea where the story was going. In an age where it seems that one movie is pretty much like another, this is a welcome surprise.<br /><br />The second additional plus was the terrific modern-classical score from Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood (including portions of his Popcorn Superhet Receiver). It is the first in recent memory that both calls unnecessary attention to itself (mostly due to its use of dissonance during particularly dramatic scenes) and remains true to the film.<br /><br />Most of the time, when I notice that I'm hearing a score, it's because it's particularly bad. A good score, most of the time, should be like a good editor: if they're doing their job, you won't notice them. But Greenwood's music outdoes itself on both fronts, making the music from There Will Be Blood also the first score since Danny Elfman's peak in the early 1990s that I am actually considering purchasing on CD.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I have been wanting to see this film for quite some time now and for the most part it doesn't disappoint! The story a ruthless, but human oil tycoon is compelling, but the ending left me wanting a bit more. The film is beautifully shot and the acting is wonderful, especially Mr. Lewis's portrayal of the main character. It's a long film, but it never feels that way. This may not be my favorite film of the year, but it's darn good!</p></br><a href="../users/A1HG2DOSBZEX4I.html">A1HG2DOSBZEX4I</a><br/><p>Director P.T. Anderson has created a moumental but flawed film about one man's ambition as it comes into conflict with the concept of faith. Based on Upton Sinclair's novel Oil!, There Will Be Blood tells the story of independant oilman Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) as he struggles to get rich in turn of the century America.<br /><br />Day-Lewis,channeling John Huston, gives a career defining performance as a man totally alone in his ambition to become rich. This film is a character study more than an action narrative. Daniel Plainview is a complex man with no friends, no sense of history and presumably no morals as he attempts to control his destiny in the growing oil business. When he comes into conflict with an evangelical preacher Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) true colors are shown and a fight to the finish is begun.<br /><br />The performance by Day-Lewis won him a deserved Best Actor Oscar. Also of note is the great camara work by Richard Elswit and the unique musical score by Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead.<br /><br />I viewed the two disc edition which features the film on disc one and special features on the second disc. The special features include 15 minutes of stills and research to a Greenwood score, two trailers and some deleted scenes. These extras run for about 30 minutes. The main feature here is The History of Petroleum (1923-27) a silent black and white film produced by Sinclair Oil and the US Bureau of Mines. This short is also scored by Greenwood.<br /><br />This film is definately worth checking out but may be a better rental than purchase. One further note the packaging on this set is horrible. The discs are squeezed into cardboard sleeves that virtually insure scratching with repeated viewings.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This is the story of one of the most eccentrically evil and heartless men that has ever been put on film.  DDL exudes the alienation and hatred of a psychotic achiever, who will stop at no humiliation or violence to achieve his goal of building a house as he remembers it from his childhood.<br /><br />The portrait of a raw Texas, shorn of romantic myth, is unbelievably vivid and graphic.  From the silent work that DDL carries out in a dank mine, you get a feeling for the lack of all social structure and decency in the greedy poor.  As he works his way up, he leaves a trail of damaged people in all his achievements.  However, this work of art is no caricature.  The characters are realistic and believable, if uglier than we care to imagine much of our past to have been.<br /><br />DDL creates a truly unique character.  He hates and uses everyone, even the son he adopts, letting no one close, especially women.  His one unguarded moment leads inexorably  to murder.  His alcoholism and seething rage are all that he has, beyond his oil wealth.  It is truly frightening.<br /><br />Recommended.  THis is a true artistic success,  but I would recommend renting it rather than buying it:  you will only want to watch it once.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UNJ46NSB352E.html">A1UNJ46NSB352E</a><br/><p>There Will Be Blood is a fantastic movie featuring one excellent performance by Daniel Day-Lewis.  The rest of the cast performs admirably.  Daniel Plainview is an oilman, taking his son around the country to make a bit of money.  Plainview's story is clearly the focus of the movie, and while it may take some patience, it is worth the ride.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray is a mixed bag; the transfer of the movie itself is excellent, but the extras are simply not there.  There's an old film on oil that was produced by the US government, there's a 15-minute slideshow/comparison to shots in the movie, and there are a small handful of deleted scenes.  The deleted scenes are the most interesting extras, and they are all worth it.  There's an especially nice end to the second one in which Plainview expresses his opinion of Eli, the preacher.<br /><br />If extras are your thing, you may want to wait to see if they ever release a special edition.  If you just want a beautiful version of the film, pick it up.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis) is a nearly emotionless man, a business first prospector and oil man who will do whatever it takes to be rich.  He comes off at times a bit possessed by the concerns and desires of becoming a filthy rich oil baron, at others a somewhat caring man, including his son H.W. Plainview in nearly all his business meetings and speeches with land-owners.<br /><br />A mysterious young boy comes to Plainview one day with tales of cheap oil land for sale in California.  He seems interested in a quick buck, but also willing to hand over the whereabouts of land that could provide Plainview untold riches.<br /><br />The small town Plainview was told about is Little Boston, and therein lives Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), a very contradictory man.  Pious yet greedy, interested in the church's prosperity but also his own stardom, perhaps a televangelist before the advent of television, Eli yearns for the power that Daniel already has and demands from others.<br /><br />The movie does a great job of displaying the incredibly harsh, dangerous life of a miner at the turn of the last century.  In this trying environment, a man will do anything for what he covets.  The juxtaposition of two powerhouse characters, who seemingly share aspirations as well as vices, is destined from the very beginning to cause a clash of wills.  Once each character is made to publicly display their flaws - Daniel's failures as a father and Eli's blasphemous nature - there is no turning back.<br /><br />There Will Be Blood is a good movie, but it's not as great as it's made out to be.  It gained Hollywood's flavor of the month shortly after its release, and Daniel Day Lewis is the best of his career and deserving of every accolade, but it's far too slow in short spells for it to be a truly epic movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things<br />*Excellent filming style, editing, and cinematography.

If you're looking for a bloody action film, this would not be it.<br />*Abrupt, crazy ending.<br /><br />This is basically like "Citizen Kane" in the west; a broad story about relentless ambition and corruption.  It's a very long, slow-moving film, with an epic scope and scale.  The story can be seen as tedious or boring, and perhaps even pointless, but the main attraction are the characters, all of whom are well-developed and well-acted.  With patience, it is worthwhile watching at least once.<br /><br />Image and sound quality is excellent (especailly in blu-ray).  The single-disc DVD has no special features.  The two-disc and blu-ray versions have a 1923 silent film depicting the oil business, a fifteen-minute montage of behind-the-scenes stuff, a few deleted scenes, and a couple of the trailers.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NYQCLFQRTI74.html">A2NYQCLFQRTI74</a><br/><p>The story of an oilman, Daniel Plainview.<br /><br />Splendid performances by Daniel-Day Lewis and Paul Dano, who is very convincing as a preacher.<br />Beautiful cinematography by Robert Elswit.<br />My hats off to the producers, who took a risk in producing this film, and to the scriptwriters who did outstanding work in adapting the book Oil by Upton Sinclair - even if they didn't respect the book 100%, the final product is a great movie.<br /><br />I certainly didn't expect this film to be this excellent.

It plays like one of those major melodramas from the earlier years and does not fail to pull you in in with its theatrics.  Day-Lewis deserved his second Oscar for sure and damn if Paul Dano is not the exact opposit of his Little Miss Sunshine trip.  It keeps spilling over the brim, but it's sure worthwhile.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>The many ways that greed manifests are countless in this film.  Virtually no character goes without claim on some level of selfishness when oil is discovered on otherwise useless California properties.  The lives of the inhabitants of a small farm community are turned upside down when the reality of what wealth can be gained dawns on them, as well as when they realize the price they will pay to have it.  The story is a believable exploitation of the land and lives of those striking out on the American frontier. Central to its conflict are Daniel Plainview, a slick oil prospector with the sincerity of a snake oil salesman, and Eli Sunday, the ambitious young pastor of a struggling country church.<br /><br />Day-Lewis Truly deserved all the accolades he won for his performance of Daniel Plainview in this film.  The range of his skills was wholly evident in this film, from the overall reserved and refined mannerisms of Plainview, to his later explosive and subtly vitriolic snide treatment of others.  In truth, every performance in this film was flawless.  In particular Paul Dano, Sunday, should have gotten more attention for his supporting role.  His passionate sermons were frightening and moving in his ability to swing from demure to suddenly thundering.  The physicality he brought to the character was entrancing as much as creepy.  I'm excited to think of what work he will do from this point forward.<br /><br />Overall the direction of the film seemed to be spot-on in delivery.  Most impressive to me were the great gaps in dialogue.  I'm always impressed when a scene is forced to move forward without speech.  That said, I'm not quite sure to what the poor pacing and seeming gaps in sequencing should be attributed.  In some places the film moved quite slowly, while sudden artless segu&eacute;s seemed to leave out huge chunks of time and plot development.  I also found the score to be extremely distracting throughout most of the film.  Indeed it was innovative and not what one would expect in a western...  Still, the musical arrangements were not only ill-suited for a lot of the film, but they were flat out too loud in much of it.<br /><br />All-in-all, the film is well done.  It will be a feather in the cap of its cast, even if the final cut was a bit dodgy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I am not reviewing the actual DVD.

Daniel Day Lewis is the finest actor of our time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I49HL6XR62DI.html">A3I49HL6XR62DI</a><br/><p>"There will be Blood" explores the oil boom in early-20th century America via its character profile of oil baron Daniel Plainview portrayed by Daniel Day Lewis. A man who literally dug his first oil strike with his own hands, Plainview becomes a swindler and, eventually, a murderer. He twists the oil out of the land by taking advantage of rural people who are too naive to understand his purposes. He goes head-to-head with rural fundamentalist preacher, Eli Sunday who is one of the few people able to understand Plainview's corruption, but who later falls victim to corporate greed himself. Upton Sinclair wrote the original novel upon which this film is based, "Oil". Daniel Day Lewis embeds himself in the corporate robber baron, Plainview. This is one of the towering performances of the 21st century.<br /><br />A great film with a stunningly inventive musical score -- electronic and mechanical. Set aside 3 hours and see "There Will Be Blood".</p></br><a href="../users/AQUVTQFFXP4AC.html">AQUVTQFFXP4AC</a><br/><p>*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />This movie solidifies Daniel Day-Lewis as the breakout actor of this decade. Always selective in his roles, he does the character of Daniel Plainview with such brilliant intensity, humor, love, hate, and subtlety that you never realize his character is changing as the movie progresses.<br /><br />The story is not at all highly dramatic and complex, following the simple story of Plainview's attempt to get at the vast ocean of oil beneath a small western village. The movie is primarily a character study, as Daniel takes up perhaps 90% of the movie.<br /><br />Paul Dano, as Eli Sunday, plays opposite Daniel not too often, but in such a social duel with one another that doesn't overwhelm or underwhelm. And you begin to notice throughout the movie that Eli becomes more and more like Daniel as the story progresses.<br /><br />The movie's focus on Daniel is done in such a way that the movie is about him, but not in a megalomaniacal way that he must be on screen at all times. Other characters shine around him, and play off of him to make their own characters that much more interesting.<br /><br />The music is highly unique, and definitely would break the movie if it were any different, or non-present at all.  It almost works like a silent movie if it were just the music and subtitles.  It could even work as a musical without singing.<br /><br />But the highest marks the movie gets, the most brilliant part of the film, the most frightening element of it, and the meaning behind my vaguely grotesque review title, is the fact that the character of Daniel Plainview is written and portrayed with such affection, reality, and depth, that he is very nearly a real person.  He could seem to be more real than many living people today.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis knows and perfectly executes every emotion the character would experience, in such a way that even when he goes overboard, it's utterly believable that such a character would say such a thing, or do such a thing.  There are no gaps in personality or lapses in logic.  From the beginning, you are frightened by how utterly real a person he is, and how utterly good-natured, kind-hearted, and human he is!  Even as he sets about his work, his primary concerns are less with making money and more with making sure his workers are provided for, the town (Little Boston) provided for, and everyone working happily at full capacity.<br /><br />Even as he slowly becomes insane, he retains aspects of humanity, as he sobs mournfully for his lost brother after learning the truth and killing the imposter Henry Plainview.  He even sobs, and drinks himself to sleep after confronting his son (at the end, when he's grown up), revealing he was an orphan he took care of after his father died, and severing all ties to him.  He does all he can for HW after the boy loses his hearing, and keeps careful tabs on him when he's sent away to a school for the deaf, constantly questioning Fletcher Hamilton about his accomodations.<br /><br />The nomination and subsequent winning of Best Actor for Daniel Day-Lewis, after watching this performance, is absolutely no contest.  I strongly and firmly believe that this was the best dramatic acting portrayal of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/AN8M401S8Y6DA.html">AN8M401S8Y6DA</a><br/><p>A well shot film by Paul Thomas Anderson about the greed that fuels the oil business based loosely on Upton Sinclair's novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934568457">Oil</a>.  Sounds like a movie about history, so what's this nonsense of a horror movie based on actual events?  The title sounds like a horror film, is it that?  No.  The score is like something out of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UJ48WC">The Shining [Blu-ray</a>], could it be the mood?  No.<br />In 2007 I pre paid for my oil and did a budget plan with a local company, my rate was $2.59.  On May 1st 2008 I was sent my new contract to lock into the a rate of $3.84 which I had to return by May 30.  On May 22, 2008 I received another letter saying they had sold out of oil in record time and my contract was void and they would send out new information.  On June 3, 2008 I received the letter stating I could lock in for $4.29 a gallon, for the avg I need that is $326 a month and $3,586.000 a year.  And I have a new house and don't use that much heat in comparison to others.  Oh, before arriving home to get the letter in the mail I stopped to fill up my gas tank at over $4 a gallon.  I've just set the stage for some real life horror or satire depending on how you see the glass.  Paul Thomas Anderson knowingly or unknowingly creates a character in Plainview  that can be used as a metaphor to mock the ridiculousness or our current state or to show the true horror of it.  As for the title in a revolution there is usually blood.  Either way nobody is packing up the family and moving to Beverly because we couldn't afford the gas it would take us to get there.<br />Another horror film just in theory it reminded me of (again only in theory) is the highly criticized <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008191WO">The Amityville Horror</a> for it's being based on a true story.  Ghosts or not that family's financial fears are real and hit home.<br />MY IDEA:<br />I read an article that stated that Nascar is suffering because these die hard fans usually travel all over to see the races but with large vehicles and what not they cant' afford it.  So here it is.  The biggest gas guzzlers have to be race cars, so what if Nascar boycotted itself.  Went on strike.  Those guys make pretty decent money and their fans are die hard.  More people might watch Sportscenter then the news and it plays about 20 times a day and each time would cover such a story.  Perhaps maybe just a well known well off racer.  It's a theory which I'm sure someone could poke a ton of holes in.  I don't have the answers I'm just throwing out ideas.<br /><br />DVD Features:  (NONE)</p></br><a href="../users/A19OQ7LWE2YJL3.html">A19OQ7LWE2YJL3</a><br/><p>It started out with a bang and I was so enthralled.  But Day-Lewis' character really bored me in the end. And the story too. Lewis's character was so odd and one-dimensional.  And frankly, I don't understand why he won Best Actor?!  It was like he was re-playing the bloody, violent, wild-eyed part from GANGS OF NEW YORK and I was disappointed.  Doesn't he play anything else?  Is that all that interests him in a role?  OK this one he has a kid, or an adopted kid, and that opens up possiblities. But honestly for such a reknowned actor I'd think he could find some more variety in his roles. C'est la vie, it's his choice of course.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>Daniel Day Lewis is very impressive in this film...and, for the most part, very handsome...even with oil on his face.  So, for my money, it's worth watching....once.  The script is based on a story by Upton Sinclair which was relevant and important at the time Sinclair wrote it.  Now...not so much.  I think the film could have been better if the main character, Daniel Plainview, had been given more to do than cheat and rob people.  True, the interaction with his son is interesting and that saves the film.  Also, the little bit with the blond girl, Mary, was interesting and, at that point, he seemed to be a caring man who was protecting the girl from beatings by her father.<br /><br />What I didn't understand from the film was how deeply he degenerated after he the son returned to him.  It seemed that things were going well for him--he had the family that he had always longed for and certainly the material success.  So why, in the last segment, in his huge mansion, was he so severely embittered?  There was nothing to explain the schism between him and his son. The final scene bordered on the bizarre...did Sinclair write that?<br /><br />While I'm complaining, I'll add that I've about had enough of the character of the charlatan minister.  Perhaps they abounded at the time of Sinclair, but I think this stereotype has been exploited enough.  I've met many wonderful men who were ministers, even of the holy roller type, and I personally find it offensive that they are so often portrayed in this way. This fellow, Eli, was alternately wimpy, cruel, craven and hysterical, not to mention that he was bad looking and had a terrible haircut. I never did understand what happened to Paul. (Only Robert DuVall, in The Apostle, showed the positive side of these men.)<br /><br />Visually the film gives you plenty to look at.  The oil well fire is spectacular.  Even though it's long, it did hold my interest, mostly because of Lewis' performance.  He is such a spectacular looking man and has such a great voice that he engages our sympathy way beyond what was realistic for such a character.<br /><br />I was heartened to read so many negative reviews...am happy to see that not everyone is impressed by the hype this film got.  I give it three stars for the overall spectacle and the Lewis' performance.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A (Paramount) / Region Free<br />VC-1 BD-50<br />Average Video Bit Rate: 26.07 Mbps<br />Total Bit Rate: 33.80 Mbps<br />Running time: 2:38:25<br />Movie size: 40,161,970,176 bytes<br />Disc size: 48,617,189,620 bytes<br />Dolby TrueHD 5.1 24-bit<br /><br /># 15 Minutes (HD, 15 minutes)<br /># Fishing (HD, 6 minutes)<br /># Haircut/Interrupted Hymn (HD, 3 minutes)<br /># Dailies Gone Wild (HD, 3 minutes)<br /># Trailers (HD, 3 minutes)<br /># The Story of Petroleum (HD, 26 minutes)<br /><br />Version: U.K / Japan (Miramax - BVHE) [Region Locked]<br />VC-1 BD-50<br />Average Video Bit Rate: ????

That is to say, it's an instant classic.  Shot with a lyrical confidence that evokes both Bernardo Bertolucci's "1900" and Terrence Malick's "Days of Heaven," it nonetheless firmly establishes its own identity, and if "Boogie Nights" or "Punch-Drunk Love" alone haven't convinced people that Paul Thomas Anderson is the most interesting American director working today, this film certainly should.  Loosely based on Upton Sinclair's "Oil" (but really having as much to do with "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre," with a little "Chinatown" and "Citizen Kane" thrown in), the tragic drama stars Daniel Day-Lewis, perhaps the greatest British actor of his generation, as Daniel Plainview, an obsessive, sociopathic robber baron who in the first scene literally wills himself back to life and crawls across a desert not so much to safety, but to cash in his haul of silver.  Those first five minutes tell us everything we need to know about this character, who will go from bad to worse to worse yet in a depiction of unbridled greed that is refreshing in its brutal honesty.  In a country where greed is so often depicted in film as divinely ordained, Plainview will seem a theatrical canard to those who catch glimpses of themselves in him, or in his like-minded foil, the duplicitous Reverend Sunday (played with effete menace by Paul Dano).  Though Day-Lewis' portrayal sometimes threatens caricature of actor/director John Huston (whose fine works include "Treasure of the Sierra Madre"), and there seems to be an act missing before the disturbing but inevitable climax of the film, it's tough to find any real flaws in the work, whose raw soundtrack by Radiohead's Johnny Greenwood is often as relentless as Plainview himself.  If I have one wish for Paul Thomas Anderson, it's that he resist Hollywood overtures to make the next tinny summer blockbuster or moronic Christmas comedy and instead keep plugging away -- he's on course to go down in history as one of America's truly great filmmakers.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>There comes a point when even a great film can be over-hyped; when even a marvel of cinema, a masterpiece if you will, will get so much attention and accolades that it becomes `that movie that failed to live up'.  On the outset, while watching `There Will Be Blood' you could come to believe that to be true of this film.  Heralded as PT Anderson's finest film to date and regarded as one of the two cinematic masterpieces of this year past, `There Will Be Blood' has an obligation to deliver.  What is sad is that many people are not aware of exactly what it plans to deliver.  I can see now how backlash can begin, but I'm here to say that `backlash' in this case is undoubtedly undeserved.<br /><br />Paul Thomas Anderson's epic masterpiece (there, I said it) `There Will Be Blood' is not the movie many may believe it to be.  It is a slow and conflicted journey through the desperations and frustrations placed upon us by greed and selfishness.  It exposes the similarities between materialism and religious self-righteousness and it proves that nothing good can come of evil.<br /><br />`There Will Be Blood' is loosely based of off Upton Sinclair's novel `Oil!' but truly it serves as Anderson's very own vision.  Anderson pits oilman Daniel Plainview against religious preacher Eli Sunday in a small town of Little Boston during the turn of the century.  Plainview is a greedy man, a selfish man who will do anything he can to get what he wants, but Sunday is not much different.  Sunday is a man consumed with a fire that matches the determination of Plainview himself.  They are a perfect match; thus they are perfect enemies.<br /><br />The film moves at a slow pace, taking it's time to build and flesh out these characters.  Aside from Plainview and Sunday you have Daniel's son, H.W., a young yet oddly mature boy who takes in much more than one would expect.  As his fathers `business partner', young H.W. stands comfortably at his father's side; a sight that is often as chilling as it is heartbreaking.<br /><br />`There Will Be Blood' is a film that opens with such a savage calm, a feeling of unsettled tranquility.  The score blazing in the distance, Plainview mining for gold; not a word spoken and yet so much is being said.  It ends on a completely different note; one of tranquil savagery; a burst of manic violence that leaves the viewer feeling oddly subdued.  It's such a masterful way to open and close a film; opening in such a way that keeps us on edge and closing in such a way that puts us at ease.<br /><br />Yet another reason why PT Anderson should have won that directing Oscar.<br /><br />The film is masterfully crafted; a film that just fits so beautifully together, each facet connecting nicely with the next.  It's beautifully shot; the Oscar winning cinematography is spellbinding to say the least.  The score is also a huge plus here, lending a helping hand in creating the perfect mood for this piece.  I remember falling in love with Greenwood's score when I first heard it, but hearing it within the confines of this film adds a whole new light to its grace and beauty.<br /><br />And then there is the acting...<br /><br />Much credit has been given to Daniel Day-Lewis for his performance as Daniel Plainview.  He's won just about every award imaginable and has received countless amounts of praise and admiration, for which he has received it with the utmost sincerity and gratitude.  I am here to acknowledge once again his magnificence here.  Day-Lewis completely becomes Daniel Plainview.  He doesn't look like Daniel Day-Lewis; he doesn't sound like Daniel Day-Lewis; he doesn't act like Daniel Day-Lewis.  Daniel Day-Lewis does not exist within this character; only Daniel Plainview is present.  He flawlessly boils to the surface this mans flaws and transgressions, his bolstering greed and domination.  There are moments when you know that this man is thinking the worst and yet all we see is that sly grin and his eyes, those eyes that speak volumes.  This is not just one of the finest performances of the year, but perhaps in the history of cinema.<br /><br />Daniel is not without good company though.  There are two other performers here that steal scenes and command attention.  Young Dillon Freasier, who plays H.W., delivers a brilliant performance.  He masterfully creates and otherworldly maturity that chills the bones while speaking barely a word.  Pay close attention to the relationship between father and son; there are volumes to be told.  Of course we have Paul Dano who plays the eccentric Eli Sunday.  His performance is mind-bogglingly good.  There is a scene where he proceeds to expel the arthritis from the hands of one of the members of his church.  It's the first scene where we really get a glimpse into this very complex character.  It's brilliant to say the least and it serves as a masterful building block for what is to come.<br /><br />`There Will Be Blood' is a film that everyone should see.  Everyone should know what they are about to witness first; that way they can really embrace it for what it is.  This is not an action film, nor a thriller in your most conventional sense.  `There Will Be Blood' is quite frankly one of the best character studies I've seen in recent years.  It's a film that flawlessly exposes the inhumanity within humanity and forces the audience to accept the `ugly' within our souls.  As many have noted; this is not a film that wants to be liked.  It will not leave you feeling warm and fuzzy on the inside, but it will leave you with much to ponder, much to think about and contemplate and will thus leave you with much to remember.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>"There will be blood" is a penetrating analysis about two equally transcendental lines; it's about how an audacious and smart oilman, who explores and makes drillings in search of the devoted black gold,  may become when the dreams of ambition and greed transform themselves in ethic values; and how these fatal consequences isolate him from his friends and family; on the other hand we have in contraposition, the religious fervor of a faker who pretends to be the embodiment of a spiritual call.<br /><br />It's not a mere coincidence the chosen historical period reminds us to the well reminded episode that inspired "Inherit the wind" in which the religious intolerance was represented in a vast portion of the nation.<br /><br />Daniel Day Lewis once more demonstrates us why he is one the ten best actors in this planet with his spellbinding performance.<br /><br />A crude and revealing testimonial of forceful transcendence</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>Watching There Will Be Blood is definently an interesting experience. I can't quite put my finger on it but there is just something so hypnotic about this film that, from the very first scene, you can't help but become oddly entranced by it all. From the almost silent fifteen first minutes to the strangely engrossing oil scenes, the slighty hysteric rantings of crazed young preacher Eli, even the almost curve ball final act, you can't help want to see more and more of the film and when it does end, you leaves you sitting there, almost tempted to want to rewatch the film all over again. Again, I can't figure out what it was but whatever it is, it just leaves you with that satisfied movie going experience.<br /><br />We are taken into the life of the charasmatic and slightly eccentric Daniel Plainview, who describes himself as a professional oil man. Already having made a impressive buisness of himself, he is approached by a young man who gives him a tip that the town he lives in may have a vast underground oil supply. Seeing the opportunity at hand, he packs up his equipment and with his son H.W. in tow, sets off for the small town with great intentions in mind. Along the way, he makes himself a rival in the form of Eli Sunday, twin brother of the boy who gave Daniel the tip off. A overbearing bible thumper, he has the same intentions of greatness as Daniel and as the movie goes on, there rivalry slowy grow as they try to make their goals into reality.<br /><br />First thing is first, all the acting is definently on par. Paul Dano (probally best known from his role in Little Miss Sunshine) brings a fire and intensity to his characters, his big scenes never boarding as over the top or zanny but just the right amount of fantatasism and passion. And as for Daniel Day Lewis, a very well known character actor with some pretty odd methods of preparing for a role, once again submerges himself into this role. He spits fire, his eyes burn with intensity, never does his performance go over to the hammy side, which in a role like this could have very easily went over the top. Oscar worthy, definently.<br /><br />Paul Thomas Anderson has always been a personal favorite of mine, Boogie Nights and Magnolia, both super diffrent films and each one so very diffrent in there own mind, and each on effective in their purpose. This was his much needed comeback film after the pretty average Punch Drunk Love, once again taking care in his work and producing an engrossing story that has you hooked from the beginning. Everything else is also great, Cinematography just pops, Art Direction is just the right amount of grit, everything in this film comes together.<br /><br />My one main critisism would probally have to be that this film may have been a bit to over hyped. Reading reviews, I've probally glimpsed the word 'Masterpiece' used in almost every single one. I wouldn't go to far as to call this film a masterpiece, I could probally name about twenty other films in the past eight years that can easily out surpass this film in terms of quality and impact. It kind of suffered the same effect as No Country for Old Men, but unlike the later film which I felt was severly overrated, this one actually deserved most of its praise.<br /><br />Other then that, it's definantly one of the films to see from 2007. Great direction, great acting, its a must see for movie lovers and a must have for PTS fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>To me, this is a typical PT Anderson film.  It has great sequences in it. It also has incredibly bad ones.  It's overlong (and I love long films).<br />It has great performances, and it has bad ones.  Its dialogue is awful.  It has great cinemtography and production design, but thematically it's a mess.  In other words, There Will Be Blood is an incredibly uneven film, which is consistent with all of PT Anderson's work.<br /><br />PT Anderson is an anomaly in his age bracket.  He's a Gen X director, but has no real sense of Gen X "irony" or smugness.  He has ambition coming out of every pore of his body.  You have to admire the hell out of him for that.  He wants to make the great, grand picture.  Most of his peers make very shallow films (Tarantino's Grindhouse is a good example).  I can't imagine PT Anderson watching Switchblade Sisters and saying "this is a great film".  I can see him saying "that chick is hot, but I still shouldn't be watching this garbage".  Having said that, he just can't make a really consistent film.  This was his first film in nearly 6 years (the last one was Punch Drunk Love in 2001), and overall, There Will Be Blood is a mess.<br /><br />There is a lot of good here.  The cinematography is gorgeous.  It's one of the most beautifully shot films I've seen in a while.  The production design is fantastic (by Jack Fisk, one of the best in the business).  The acting by Daniel Day Lewis is mesmerizing.  Lewis's face, eyes, and voice are so expressive that you forget some of the bad dialogue that you can't take your eyes off of him.  There are some downright surreal, intense scenes.  When Daniel Day Lewis kills his "brother", it's one of the most effective scenes in the film.  Music, look, acting, it all gels.  The next scene (in a church) is purposely overlit, and continues the surrealism.  It's very good.  The rest of the film continues the haunted look, which I really liked.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these good things are undone by many bad things.  The dialogue here has to be some of the worst I've heard in a long time.  Andreson has never been able to write really good dialogue, and here it's really bad.  Lewis's monologues are really obvious, and the infamous line "I drink your milkshake" has entered into movie folklore, but not for the majesticness of the speech, but for the camp value.  There's also a really, really bad line in one of Paul Dano's (Eli Sunday is the name of the character.  Rather obvious for a preacher, eh?) where he says "I will gum you!".  The townspeople are portrayed as simpletons, something that seems to always happen in period pieces like this.  There is no real motivation for Lewis's character other than he is greedy.  Thematically, his desertion of his son (he does it twice in the film) makes no sense.  One scene he is playing with the boy, then the boy goes deaf, then Lewis puts him on a train.  Then he comes back.  Then later in the film, Lewis tells his son he's an orphan who Lewis just used as a prop to get people to go along with his plans.  This is obviously not true, but there is no explanation, narratively or artistically, as to why there's such inconsistency.  PT Anderson seems to be stuck between a straightforward narrative and a surreal tone, and it doesn't work.  And the final scene, while beautifully shot and designed, is unintentionally funny, much like the frogs finale in Magnolia.<br /><br />Dano's character is poorly drawn.  Many have said he was miscast, but I would argue that he just didn't have a good character to build on.  He's the cliched preacher.  The rest of the character are caricatures.  The music score is another problem.  Sometimes it's perfect (like in the brother's death scene), other times it's so out of place.  Anderson was trying to do someting different obviously, but it just doesn't work overall.  The score is reminiscent of Stravinsky and Mozart, and sounds more like a symphony than a film score.  Many have said that Johnny Greenwood's score would make a good listening experience in itself, away from the film.  They're right.<br /><br />Many have said that PT Anderson borrows (or steals) from Kubrick here.  He does.  The leaps in time recall the abrupt time changes in 2001 and Full Metal Jacket, the madness of Lewis recalls The Shining (he's even walking the same way Jack Nicholson does at the end of The Shining), and the eerie, deliberately uttered dialogue in the final scene is reminiscent of the billard room scene in Eyes Wide Shut.  Anderson also said in interviews he wanted to emulate the Dawn of Man sequence in 2001 in the opening of the film (which has minimal dialogue).  Regardless of whether Anderson is ripping off Kubrick or simply being influenced by him (there is a difference between the two), the whole film still doesn't flow, like 2001, The Shining, and Eyes Wide Shut do.<br /><br />So, overall, this film has enough great moments in it to view it.  It is not as good as Citizen Kane or Giant.  Those films had a lot of depth and character that this one simply lacks.  See There Will Be Blood (great title, by the way) for Daniel Day Lewis, the cinematography, production design, and, if you're into that sort of thing, laugh at the unintentionally funny scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A185QFJRTB5W93.html">A185QFJRTB5W93</a><br/><p>This movie shows the "corporate" depravity that exist in so many people.  Putting money over all other things never leads to a good end.  Overall, I admit that I liked the film.  It should have ended about 15 minutes sooner and it would have been EXCELLENT.  However, due to that final 15 minute RANT, I can only give the film 3 stars.  The ending was unneeded in an otherwise fine film.  Lewis does an extraordinary job in his performance, but we even tire of watching his lunacy by the end.  Just a RENTAL...nothing more.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>This long film (by today's standards) is riveting at all times, thanks to the vision and control of Paul Thomas Anderson. It's been said that Daniel Day-Lewis only re-channelled his performance as Bill the Butcher (Gangs of New York), but here he's in almost every scene, and the performance is as complete as it can get; the nastiest performance to win an Oscar since Hannibal Lechter or Aileen Wuornos.  He deserved the Oscar. I longed for some information regarding Mr. Plainview's previous history, and the appearance of Kevin J. Dillon as his step-brother was a great sub-plot. It's the only time Plainview showed any concern for anyone but himself. None of it turns out good. Rehashing the plot wouldn't make sense, but this is a finely crafted film, rich in detail and excellent cinematography. I also enjoyed Paul Dano (L.I.E.; Little Miss Sunshine), who showed range of character throughout. One argument is that the 2-disc DVD is inadequate, regarding Disc 2, and that is correct. Most interviews are repetitive, and it included some old documentary footage of the importance of oil...duh...?! Anyway, it's a worthy film. Check it out!</p></br><a href="../users/A2UW83R0JOZZ6.html">A2UW83R0JOZZ6</a><br/><p>Winner of two Academy Awards for Best Actor (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Best Cinematography, "There Will Be Blood" is based upon the 1927 novel "Oil!" by Upton Sinclair and takes place in California during the early 20th century with an oil prospecter making his fortune.  Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis), the aforementioned oilman, is a shrewd businessman and sees death early on as a part of life in the industry but it is only after he is challenged by a deceptive evangelist does death go from inadvertent to unmistakably discriminate.<br /><br />In a cacophonous mix of cutthroat business and zealous religion, a war is instigated when a young man named Paul Sunday (Dano) comes to Daniel and offers to point him in the direction of a surefire fortune in exchange for a handsome sum.  Paul's hometown village of "Little Boston" is a figurative gold mine, the family farm and the hundreds of miles surrounding it an untapped wealth of crude oil.  Under the guise of pheasant hunting enthusiasts, Daniel and his son H.W. (Freasier) start investigating the property and their suspicions are quickly confirmed.  Within no time, a deal is on the table but Paul's twin brother Eli (Dano), a local preacher, impedes the contract by not only demanding a generous portion of the proceeds but also the chance to expand his modest congregation.  Hiding behind the fa?ade of Christianity, he is motivated by greed, only to be unexpectedly matched by the cruelty and cunning of Daniel.<br /><br />The film is more than deserved of both of its Oscars, namely Day-Lewis's riveting performance as Daniel Plainview, a man who is torn between the love for his son and his love for self-affluence (or so one thinks).  The 52-year old Oscar winner's performance is matched by that of his 24-year old co-star Paul Dano as Eli Sunday.  Though he was cast as both of the Sunday brothers, it is as the sanctimonious Eli that Dano makes a pointed connection with the audience.  He is the character whom viewers love to hate, using religion to veil his egoism and his struggle for power, so much so that he aids in lending sympathy to Daniel, a man whose motivations are equally insatiate to his own.<br /><br />Stunning cinematography comes courtesy of Robert Elswit, a man who served as director of photography for P.T. Anderson's much-discussed `99 film "Magnolia".  Filmed in greater part in Marfa, Texas (neighboring with the cast and crew of "No Country For Old Men"), Elswit recreates and highlights the best of old California's sweeping vistas, its rustic mountain ranges, rolling hills and dry desert-like tundra the picture-perfect backdrop.<br /><br />Paul Thomas Anderson has a short but unique body of work and this film has created the official apex of his career.  It is also a sign that there will be many more interesting projects to come from this 38-year old writer/director/producer.  Dusting off the ashes ten years after the outrageous cult favorite "Boogie Nights", "There Will Be Blood" is a definitive sign that this director has matured.<br /><br />Out of a total of 10 stars, I give it a 9.  I can only hope it will parallel to Joel and Ethan Cohen's magnum opus "No Country For Old Men".</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>It is 1898, and Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) has just struck oil for the first time.  As the years pass, Plainview becomes a wealthy oilman, traveling the countryside with his son, buying land and building oil wells.  When he buys one farm, he begins an antagonistic relationship with a young preacher.<br /><br />I didn't "get" this movie.  I know critics praised it for being a great piece of art but for me it was two and a half long hours of monotonous tedium.  The only thing interesting about it was the soundtrack which created an eerie, ominous mood, making me believe it was building to some exciting action.  But the plot, such as it is, just rambles through the years and we learn nothing of the oilman's background or his thoughts  beyond the oilfield.  We don't know why he's so angry and cold.<br /><br />There is minimal dialogue and when people do speak, there is no emotional connection (except for Plainview and his odd son, but even that deteriorates - and again, we don't know why).  The young preacher wasn't believable at all; he seemed weak and silly, not at all an equal adversary for the heartless Plainview.  No one in the cast was sympathetic or interesting and I gave up caring about them.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Some people have already hailed this as a masterpiece topping nearly all films in history.  I saw one recent list of the greatest movies ever made that put There Will be Blood as number two, following only <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W0WM">Casablanca</a>.  Perhaps that kind of message is somewhat consistent with the film's themes of false prophets and capitalist hype.  Time will tell if this movie deserves that kind of glorious praise I suppose, but I will agree without a shadow of a doubt that among the many tall trees in 2007, There Will be Blood is the tallest.  It is an astounding achievement and P.T. Anderson (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PAAJZ6">Boogie Nights</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PAAJYW">Magnolia</a>) has officially settled into all of his massive potential.  He had not made a movie in five years but has always shown flashes of brilliance.<br /><br />There Will be Blood is apparently based to some degree on the Upton Sinclair novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0141031700">Oil!</a>.  The movie tells the tale of a silver miner named Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) who stumbles upon oil deposits in one of his mines.  The first part of the film shows us how he gradually refines his drilling techniques and how he eventually creates a massively successful oil enterprise.  One of his expeditions into a small town suspected of having vast oil reserves is framed in greater detail and introduces us to Eli (Paul Dano), a faith healer and head of the Church of the Third Revelation.  Many other significant stories involving Plainview's adopted son and a half-brother he didn't know he had, also portray the moral dilemmas he faces, but it is his dance with Eli that is more fascinating and layered than many cinematic conflicts I can think of.  Blind faith and devotion, whether it be in God or money, so easily devolve to greed, dishonesty, and self-destruction.  This is a dark movie with an incredibly powerful screenplay.<br /><br />Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead put together the music and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XA50MK">soundtrack</a> is as effective as we've come to expect from a P.T. Anderson movie, as is the first rate cinematography from Anderson partner Robert Elswit, who has put together a wonderful career even outside of Anderson's movies.  However, stylistically this is restrained by comparison to Anderson's earlier films and I actually think it serves to make the film far more effective.  Almost everyone loves the hip booming <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002UKO">soundtrack</a> and Tarantino-esque dialogue of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PAAJZ6">Boogie Nights</a>,  but it would not have worked in a serious film like this, and Anderson seems to have grown out of caring about that sort of thing.  Good for him, I really enjoyed forgetting I was watching a movie and instead stepping into the cutthroat world of Daniel Plainview for two and a half hours.<br /><br />The one element of this film that will be remembered in the annals of cinematic history is of course the Oscar winning, and more than Oscar worthy, performance of Daniel Day Lewis.  This guy is never less than great in anything he has ever done and seems to come out of seclusion every three to five years or so to show the rest of the world what acting really is.  I'm hard-pressed to think of a performance that is definitely better than this one.  He is a remarkable and gifted actor, and showcases that here more than anywhere else.  On the other hand, I think Paul Dano's performance will be overlooked.  The young actor was highly praised in many circles for his performance in 2006's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7VHQE">Little Miss Sunshine</a>, a dramatically different performance in a dramatically different movie, but here is even better and is definitely one to look out for.<br /><br />There Will be Blood offers great visuals, great performances, and significant insights that some viewers may be sensitive to.  I felt a subtle contemporary social commentary that points to overwhelming hypocrisies happening in our modern world.  I cannot recommend this movie highly enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>That the "critics" will eat up.  Only the performances of Daniel Day-Lewis as Daniel Plainview and Paul Dano as Eli Sunday save "There Will Be Blood" from being a terrible film.  Director Paul Thomas Anderson empties out a bag of tricks in order to make this movie appeal to award-giving crowd, thus eliminating the interests of most movie-goers.  Lewis is a greedy, driven oilman intent on getting the most profit from his victims by using his own down-to-earth sales pitch and cute son.  Dano plays a preacher intent on doing the same thing, but through conning the crowd as a fire and brimstone preacher.  The two lock horns when Plainview buys Sunday's family farm from his father at a bargain and then blowing off Eli and his requests for money for the church.<br /><br />The film runs about an hour too long and is littered throughout with long shot sequences, erratic music and, in actuality, very little blood.  Many have accused Anderson of either stealing from Stanley Kubrick or paying homage to him through this film.  Either way, he's no Stanley Kubrick.<br /><br />Lewis and Dano play their respective characters very well.  Plainview is a complete jerk, even to his son.  There is a very matter-of-factness in Lewis' delivery of lines that makes the character worth struggling through the plodding script to see.  Dano's Sunday is just as vicious, but in a much more sinister and silent way.  Only when he's preaching does he really raise his voice.  He also has a violent streak, as the viewer will witness during an interaction with his father.<br /><br />Overall, this film is average.  There is nothing entirely terrible about it but there's nothing entirely great either.  Dano and Lewis do great jobs with what they're given, but it's not enough to give "There Will Be Blood" more than three stars.  Recommended as a rental, unless you believe that every film that's ever won some type of award truly deserved it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JHHYYOOO4DS6.html">A2JHHYYOOO4DS6</a><br/><p>I was blown away by his performance. A Simple story of a man struggling to make a living without the support of a wife.... only a somewhat challenging child. What seems slow at first picks up the pace as new characters are introduced. It is then we get to see people's personalities evolve under changing circumstances. (The preacher man was a riot.)</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Similar to the film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005V9IJ">Cast Away</a> in which Tom Hanks carries the entire production, THERE WILL BE BLOOD has that same air due to the phenomenal performance by Daniel Day-Lewis ...with one big exception. Hanks was alone, so there really was no other supporting cast to compare him against while on his little island (unless you count the volleyball, `Wilson'). Daniel Day-Lewis was surrounded by a fine cast, but he outshone everyone of them by leagues.<br /><br />Not surprising, Day-Lewis won every acting award in every awards ceremony in 2007 (from the Oscars on down).<br /><br />More of a story about greed, There Will Be Blood is also a battle of wills: one with god-fearing faith and the other without. The faithful is represented by a fire-breathing preacher named Eli Sunday (Paul Dano, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7VHQE">Little Miss Sunshine</a>). Apparently an identical twin, Eli's brother Paul finds the successful oil tycoon Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) and offers up his family's ranch in California as a place where "oil runs on the surface of the ground." Daniel and his `son' head onto the ranch and discover that there is, indeed, a lot of oil to be had. Making an initial promise to Eli that they'll "build a new church" for the local congregation, Daniel sets to work buying up all the surrounding property and dropping his first rig into the ground. Problems quickly arise with Eli, however, who has his own form of greed: the greed of religion. Wanting his money to build his church, Eli inserts himself into Daniel's business and the two quickly bump heads. Bad things begin happening around the new oil derrick: a well-man dies, an explosion and fire, and the sudden head injury of Daniel's son, H.W. Plainview (Dillon Freasier).<br /><br />The greed of Daniel Plainview knows no bounds, and the internal corruption that it causes is eked out in terrible portions. When Daniel put his son on a train and abandons him, we see that there's much more beneath the surface of this fractured man. Morality isn't something he's familiar with. Eli quickly zeroes in on this and all but forces Daniel to be baptized and saved in order to continue his successful drilling of the area. This is something that will come back and haunt both Eli and Daniel at the end of the film.<br /><br />Again, it is the awe-invoking performance by Day-Lewis that carries the film throughout its 158 minute length. The other actors do fine jobs, no doubt about it, but they pale in comparison to Day-Lewis' John Huston inspired performance (his voice was impeccable).<br /><br />This is a pretty dark film with not-just-a-few allusions that lean toward biblical text (many of the character names are taken straight from the bible, including Abel, Mary, Daniel, and Eli). The allusions go deeper than simple names, however, and watching There Will Be Blood one can't help but see them. The great part about this is that the ending doesn't wind up where you think it should. Forget redemption. You'll know how harsh Daniel Plainview's life has become when you hear him say, "I'm finished." [shiver!]</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>This is a fantastic film, a sort of study on the character defects we all possess.  The dark side of humanity exposed, flaws illuminated like skin under florescent lighting.  Faith tested and put under scrutiny and later proven.  Tough questions asked but never answered.  Egos bashed and bruised.  Boys turned into men, unwillingly.  These are some of the topics covered in "There Will Be Blood", subtle and sometimes blatant, it sneaks into your brain like a slow poison.  "There Will be Blood" is old school cinema.  It's not brainless violence, super hero melodrama.  It's storytelling and character driven.  The score is fantastic as well, casting a sureal vibe to a story that is as old as time, ego and greed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>Overall, There Will Be Blood is a film with a good opening, a few good potential moments and scenes (as with the faux brother), but it ends in near disaster. Its ending would rank as one of the worst in history (think Akira Kurosawa's Rashomom) if only the rest of the film had been stronger. Also, in no way, shape, nor form is the film an `epic.' Other than the word `surreal' the term epic may be the most overused and misused word in the arts. An epic is a tale that covers a great deal of history, time, and place. It also delves deeply into the characters and plot. There Will Be Blood is a series of cursory sketches that are meager and often poorly connected. I spoke of the hit and miss cinematography, but the musical scoring to this film is even worse. And, even if one were to put aside the technical lack, and the script problems, there's the acting. It's simply not good. The two main characters, Lewis and Dano have no chemistry, in the sense that their hatred of each other never seems genuine. And, while Dano is a cipher emotionally, Lewis chews scenery even more than he did as Bill The Butcher In Martin Scorsese's Gangs Of New York. Granted, while not a great film, that film was better written than this one, but there is a certain cartoonishness in Lewis's portrayal that neuters all attempt at real drama. One cares not a damn for any of the mannekin-like characters- save perhaps for the faux brother, whose very fakeness was designed merely to show of Lewis's character's rage and psychopathy, but did nothing of the sort. It only made the faux brother's character seem slighter by his casual dismissal from Daniel's life. Also, the tale is both too linear and too sparse in development to have any real poesy. It relies not on characterization but grotesques- they aren't even caricatures. And, after the first fifteen minutes, I kept wondering what a real visionary director like Theo Angelopoulos or Michelangelo Antonioni would have done with this film's premise- even its footage, for quality editing could have severely tightened the film up, and made it less dependent upon overwrought theatrics. In essence, one can tell this was a Hollywood film, even from the first minutes of silence.<br /><br />  There Will Be Blood attempts to be epic, great, and tie in with the current political zeitgeist by showing viewers the beginnings of what caused global warming. Instead, it is a meandering tale that relies on soap operatic tricks (such as Bandy's blackmailing Daniel into Eli's church- why?) that don't even have a payoff, however cheap; as well as being dull and poor in almost every filmic aspect (not unlike its twinned, wildly overpraised critical cousin, the Coen Brothers' No Country For Old Men). That this film got so raved over as a great piece of cinema shows how little critics and filmgoers today understand real art and/or care about it. Which scenario is worse is open for debate. This film's quality isn't.</p></br><a href="../users/A31JRSZQ76YA1N.html">A31JRSZQ76YA1N</a><br/><p>OBVIOUSLY INSPIRED by Von Stoheim's GREED - this "homage" to the silent screen is dreadful.<br /><br />Daniel Day Lweis impersonates the Great Walter Huston - shame on you Boy!Dano is wonderful though as the religious fanatic .....<br />it could have been worse ....<br />but very overstated as "art".</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Okay, the three stars are for the cinematography, production design, and some of the acting.<br />Here are the flaws:<br />1.  the music is irritating and pervasive to the point of being a distraction.  We don't need to be manipulated with music; just tell the story.<br />2.  I assume Daniel Day-Lewis was doing the best he could with the "direction."  The same goes for Paul Dano, though I found his preacher-man over the top at times.  The wonderful Ciaran Hinds (I think it was him) is wasted in a tiny role. The only one I enjoyed watching was the young boy playing H.W.<br />3.  the tracking shots and several other shots linger too long.  This is a common problem with directors who are so enamored of their own work that they cannot bear to clip out a single frame in the editing room.<br />4.  The last part of the film is bizarre.  The milkshake/bowling alley scene is unintentionally funny, and we have no idea what happened between 1911 and 1927.  How did Daniel deteriorate so much?  And the last scene just leaves us wondering how long he's going to sit on the bowling lanes with a dead body.<br />Rent it on cheapo day, but don't pay full price.</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>THERE WILL BE BLOOD is a perfect example of the disconnect of Hollywood and its version of a "good" movie and what the American public will pay to go see. This movie was nominated for several awards, including best picture, and Daniel Day Lewis picked up the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Daniel Plainview. Daniel Plainview is an oil man. He's an independant oil man and very persuasive at getting land owners to let him drill on their land. Plainview gets word of a town that has tons of oil, and he heads there with his young son. Plainview convinces the town to let him drill on their land, and promises new roads and schools and much wealth for the people.<br /><br />This movie is all about Daniel Plainview, his son, and the person he truly is. As the movie progresses, Daniel Plainview doesn't change, he just reveals what kind of person he is. The movie is based on the novel OIL, by socialist Upton Sinclair, yet the movie contains no political message against big oil or big business. Plainview's primary adversary in the movie is Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), a pastor of a small church in the town. While the church's beliefs are anything but mainstream, the movie has really nothing to say about religion.<br /><br />This is a movie made in Hollywood for Hollywood. I'll admit I enjoyed Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Daniel Plainview. In the film, Plainview looked exactly like a 1980s Tom Selleck. I also enjoyed the scenery and early 20th centurey setting. For the first twenty minutes of the movie, there is no dialogue. This is very unrealistic and shows that the filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson is trying to take the viewers out of the movie and notice the director.<br /><br />This is a well made movie with a good performance by Lewis. But it is also an overlong character study of a despicable man. I can see why this movie won awards, and I can also see why it was a box office failure. (According to Box Office Mojo, ranked 66th in 2007, just behind WATER HORSE: LEGEND OF THE DEEP.)</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>A man is digging beneath ground into rock.

Sinclair's novel must have been much better than this film.]</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>I like basically any movie that Daniel Day Lewis appears in and this is no exception. The actor, Paul Dano, was previously unknown to me, but he did a fine job portraying the Sunday brothers here. There Will Be Blood may not be faithful to Upton Sinclair's original story but it is a compelling portrait of evil in this world. I always laugh at those who think human beings are more good than evil. I have never seen any evidence for this being true in the course of my life. Evil is capable of corrupting us all, and Lewis's Daniel Plainview is a haunting portrait of a man who emits villainy the way most of us emit carbon dioxide. For this reason, Paul Thomas Anderson has put together a classic and valuable movie. I admit that it wasn't pleasant to watch but it certainly was excellent.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>The film has well earned its prizes, awards and other distinctions. But beyond these labels on the sleeve of the DVD or the poster of the film, the film will remain a milestone in the cinema that tries to show the real world and the ruthlessness of its survival instinct.<br /><br />The first element I will point out is that it gives the lie to Hubbard and his survival in scientology. In the real world there is no survival without development and development is first: no development then extinction. Ask Neanderthals when he was to share Europe with Cro-Magnon. The poor Neanderthals could not even fish and ran like mammoths. The real survival is in the power of man, as a species and as an individual, to develop. Survival that does not bring and presuppose development is just a fake, a false prophecy. I say that for two reasons.<br /><br />The first reason is that without the oil industry, there would have been no car industry (and other inner combustion engine industry), no gas station networks, no highway networks, no suburban development. That's the most clear and brutal side of the film. The oil industry brings a new phase in the industrial revolution of its own on which we are still living and polluting. Millions of people got jobs, millions of people got income, millions of people got a present and a future. Survival in development. But this development is also violent and it is the fitter who can develop most and fastest. So on the starting line there might be many people but on the arrival line there will only be a few if not only one. It is easier to make a camel get through the eye of a needle than to bring many winners on the winning line of industrial competition.<br /><br />The film is absolutely ugly and gruesome about it and it makes so many people, in the film, completely sick and disturbed. A man is ready to assume the identity of another provided this new identity is that of the main character's brother for an obvious profit. Don't forget that prophet and profit are homonyms. A child is ready to set the hut in which he is sleeping with his father and fake uncle ablaze just to mark his territory and his resistance and his dissatisfaction. And there are so many other cases.<br /><br />Then, my second reason, in any fast developing situation like this one there are some people who will take advantage of it to mentally control the change, that is to say to gather people behind them and then pressurize the industrialists so that the gurus can get what they want, which is worldly power and money. These are the second type of false prophets of the industrial age. They can be religious and affiliated to any church, most of them being purely opportunistic about the rich provided they give money to the various churches, temples, synagogues or mosques, and of course other good benefacting (I mean bringing a profit to the prophet) organizations. The religious organizations and their prophets, false most of them, are the typical form of that vampiristic money sucking leeches in the USA who can only survive if God blesses the child and America.<br /><br />But there are other forms that are just as deadly and life-sucking. You can see Hitler and the Nazi party, and all other fascistic movements, as exactly the same ambition: take advantage of the developing industrial revolution to line your pockets with power and money. But on the other side you can have all the socialistic and communistic preaching that is exactly the same thing. And the military forces can decide to use their weapons to become the false prophets of this industrial development. The worst concoction is when one of these political movements takes the control of the armed forces, or vice versa, and then they establish a totally irreversible dictatorship.<br /><br />Irreversible, well, maybe not.<br /><br />The film suggests that you can always become deaf to these and run away and start your own development in some other country or state. It also suggests that the industrialists and the prophesizing profiteers may get into a fight to the death and then some others will come and pick up the pieces and recuperate the whole treasure chest. The film does not allude to the political mode of democratic management of this development. Just be the prophet that will win an election till a new prophet comes and wins it against you and gets you out. But be sure this intruder will not last long and will be out of the job when another one comes and claim victory. Democracy is a permanent rotation of false prophets.<br /><br />Alleluia<br /><br />Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/A2SNUORW55MZWO.html">A2SNUORW55MZWO</a><br/><p>....not when Daniel Day_Lewis is involved. Seriously, I had to put off writing this review for a couple of weeks because I was speechless. Once again Mr. Day-Lewis takes complete control. This is a great movie... Even better than I could ever describe. The story is great, the directing and scenery... it's all great. But the acting is out of this world. A lot of people said this is a slow and long movie, yet I was captivated from the very first second. When it was over I felt like it only lasted a few minutes. At first I couldn't figure out what was going on... was the main character a caring and feeling man? Did he truly love his son? I don't want to give anything away, but let's just say that this movie had me going back and forth the entire time until the very end. The film has everything I love... especially the whole God debate. I truly enjoyed this movie and it is worth probably about 12 stars. Let's face it, we are lucky to live in this period where, in my opinion, we are treated to the greatest actor in history making films for us to see. This movie and Daniel Day-Lewis are perfect as perfect can be. There Will Be Blood is absolutely a movie you should own. Oh, you gotta see this!</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>This movie did not appeal to me.  It is a overly long epic on a greedy, crazy, deceptive man, Daniel Plainview (played by Daniel Day Lewis).  The movie is based on the 1927 Sinclair novel Oil!  It begins in 1902 showing Plainview as a mineral and silver prospector in the Southwest.  The first 30 minutes drag on as there is little dialogue. After one of his workers dies in an accident, Plainview adopts the man's orphaned son.  We find out later the mother also died in childbirth.  He names the boy H.W. (Dillon Freasier) and uses him to establish himself as a family man and set a good image.<br /><br />Several years later, 1911, Plainview meets Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) who comes to his office with a proposal.  He knows of an oil deposit under his family's property in Little Boston, California and will let Plainview in on the secret for $500.  Plainview agrees travels out with H.W. asking to camp and quail hunt with his son.  After dinner with the Sunday family one evening he asks to buy the land at $3,700, which he feels is a good deal.  Paul's twin brother Eli (also played by Paul Dano) understands Plainview's deceptive offer and holds out for $10,000.  He wants part of his father's money to found a church.  Finally Plainview agrees and oil producton on the Sunday land begins.<br /><br />Eli asks Plainview to bless the oil well at the dedication.  Plainview, for some reason feels this is a power-play, and grabs Mary Sunday (a family member who does not like to pray) and dedicates the well holding her hand.<br /><br />Soon an on-site accident kills a worker, deafens his adopted son, and also catches the rig on fire.  You wonder if Eli should have blessed the well.<br /><br />Later a visitor (Kevin J. O'Connor) comes to Plainview's home saying he is his half brother and needs work.  Plainview takes him in, and H.W. discovers flaws in his story an attempts to kill him by setting his bed alight.  Plainview is upset at his boy's behavior and sends him to a school in northern California.<br /><br />The movie then goes into deals and offers with Union and Standard oil, a murder, deals and insults from Eli.  Later, in 1927, H.W. (Russell Harvards) finishes school and marries his childhood sweetheartr Mary Sunday (Colleen Foy).  His father, Daniel Plainview lives in a mansion alone.  He is obsessed with business and alcohol.  H.W. (through a sign language interpreter) to let him establish his own business.  This means disolving their partnership.  Plainview makes fun of his son's deafness and tells him of his origins and that he was adopted.<br /><br />Later, Eli visits Plainview, now head of a larger church and a religious radio show.  He needs money and goes to Plainview.  The odd ending shows that Plainview wants Eli to confess he is a false profit and God is a superstition. Eli finally does so after much humiliation.  The setting is the mansions bowling alley.  More anger and dialogue about land and oil ensue between Eli and Plainview, then Plainview uses an oversized straw to drink Eli's milkshake from across the room.  Then an angry Plainview chases Eli around the room with a bowling pin beating  him to death with it.  The only servant in the house comes down to see what is going on.  Plainview says "I'm finished" and the film ends.<br /><br />So the film bores, shows the worst of capitalism, greed and deception, and the ending is bizarre.  Daniel Day Lewis does a fine acting job, but the insane greedy character was not worth watching despite all the awards he and the movie received.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>This film is a total package art form.  It has fascinating story, all around great actors and mesmerizing music that from the start is letting us know that there could not be possible good ending to this storytelling.  We learn about Daniel Plainview, a man who is living in California searching for oil.  It is late 1800s and people are still trying to find their own riches in the new land.  Daniel is shrewd, calculated and persistent.  He wants to succeed in his endeavors more than anything.  We learn about the day of the oil man rigger who life is full of physical demands and hard work.  Job is dirty and dangerous and oil fields are not afraid to claim their victims.  As Daniel becomes successful and accumulates capital, he is eager to continue searching for new wells and dig them until there is no more oil left.  In that effort helps him his young son whose innocent looks and quiet demeanor are bait for family people eager to sell their property to another family man trying to make a living for himself and his motherless son.  This all continues well until Daniel meets his arch nemesis - a local preacher who wants to make a congregation from the local oil diggers and their families.  Over the years, these two have their own disagreements and manage to get even with each other only to prove to each other that they are really the same and as such cannot coexist.  What fascinated me is the character of Daniel - he is dark, full of hatered and contempt of people even the ones closest to him, he is a loner without ever feeling lonely who knows how to feed of other people's emotions and needs and then use them to his own advantage.  This is one of those films that everyone should have in their personal library.  Daniel Day Lewis has won Academy Award for his role of Daniel Plainview but I must say that young Paul Dano was a great supporting actor too.</p></br><a href="../users/AK0CENM3LUM28.html">AK0CENM3LUM28</a><br/><p>There Will Be Blood / B0013FXWU6<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />For the life of me, I don't understand why this film received such rave reviews. I was genuinely looking forward to it, having heard how good it was and being a literary fan of Upton Sinclair, but neither myself nor my fiance thought this film was any good.<br /><br />I can't help but feel that someone needs to inform Hollywood that "long" does not equal "epic", and that a focused, meaningful short story is far more powerful than a long-winded, meandering plod to the three hour mark. Much of this movie feels like a desperate search for a meaning or point to hang its hat on, which is a shame because if Sinclair brought anything to his writing, it was a point, albeit an often propaganda-laden one. And, fundamentally, this movie doesn't seem to understand where it wants to go or what it wants to do with Sinclair's points - there are some shades of his pro-socialism message (such as when Plainview promises that the development of the oil derrick will be accompanied by the development of schools, irrigation systems, and other improvements to symbiotically aid the community) as well as some criticism against capitalism and religion as being means to control the working class, but the directors clearly aren't married to the ideas and the watered-down presentation and uncertain focus render the message confused and vestigial.<br /><br />Instead, the writers seemingly want to focus on the character of Daniel Plainview, but even this ends up inconsistent, as they cannot decide whether to portray Plainview as a decent but haunted man spiraling into madness or a charming, sociopathic murderer. Possibly this indecision is due to a desire for an amoral, enigmatic character, but without a driving plot or point, character development was the only thing left to carry this movie. Early on, there is a half-hearted attempt to personalize the capitalism vs. religion struggle into one between Plainview and Eli, the local preacher, but the attempt feels forced and unnatural - Eli is so cartoonishly ghoulish and evil that he feels more like a cardboard cut-out than a person and Plainview's character change between bemused acceptance and violent resistance occurs with an almost audible 'clunk' as though a switch were flipped. The result is less that Plainview feels like a sum of his tragic experiences and pain and more like an authorial insertion who is kind as required and murderous when not. Unfortunately, authorial insertion characters are not interesting because they tell us nothing about humanity (as they are driven by plot necessities, rather than realistic events or emotions).<br /><br />Ultimately, I can't help but feel that this movie was crippled by its own ambitions. With a little more polish and a lot of editing, I feel this movie could have worked in either of two ways - either with Daniel a kind man (rescuing his adoptive son, attempting to build up the community, etc.) who is broken by the betrayals around him (Eli the preacher, his fake brother, his son's radical behavioral changes) OR with Daniel as a complete sociopath (using his son to his advantage, murdering and cheating his partners, deceiving the community into believing they will receive more than he intends to deliver) who wreaks havoc in the lives around him, particularly his son. Unfortunately, the movie seems to want to have its cake and eat it too, and isn't willing to pick one direction and stick with it. Daniel is not a kind but wronged man as he begins the movie as ready and willing to cheat, deceive, and murder his way to the top as he is at the end of the movie; and while Daniel could easily be described as a sociopath in the movie's present state, the fact of his sociopathic nature doesn't drive the movie because it never actually tragically affects anyone - all the ancillary characters either deserve his bad treatment (Eli) or are the better for it in order to escape him (his son).<br /><br />A note about the score in this movie - we thought it was dreadful. I was shocked to see it in mentioned as a *positive* aspect of the movie. I, personally, do not think that the same strain of drumming or the same five notes on a violin repeated over and over and OVER again for 20 minutes is something a composer should be proud of, but to each his own, I guess.<br /><br />Based on what I've read of the other reviews, I think it's safe to hazard that if you're a fan of the director, you'll probably disagree with my review and enjoy the movie for your own reasons, and I respect that. I suppose, then, that this review is directed more to Sinclair fans and non enthusiasts as a warning that you may not find this lengthy movie to be as griping as advertised.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I'm a *little* disappointed with There Will Be Blood. I was led to believe it was a dark horror film, but it's anything but. The pace is identical to a slow-moving western, and the storyline isn't what I expected either. The ending is absolutely terrible too.<br /><br />I DO like moments of the storyline because it focuses on one mans greed and the consequences and inner torment he constantly feels as a result of thinking only about himself and the money he makes concerning oil. This is good stuff. The storyline surrounding his son is pretty good too.<br /><br />A good portion of the beginning is oddly quiet with eerie violin strings playing for several minutes, making it appear like a good horror film is about to kick in... but no, it's not anything like a horror film.  In fact for a while I was wondering if anybody would actually SPEAK!<br /><br />Actually the violins are REALLY good throughout the movie, always giving you the feeling something ominous is about to take place such as a brutal killing scene or one of the characters completely snapping suddenly... no, doesn't ever happen.<br /><br />And where's the BLOOD? There really isn't any.<br /><br />It's basically a twisted drama when it comes down to it. One thing about the storyline that bugged me is the way the time period would suddenly jump forward several years with only a short time for the viewers to prepare for it. It felt a bit rushed as a result.<br /><br />Overall, the movie kept my attention of course, otherwise I wouldn't have bothered giving it 4 out of 5 stars. It's fairly enticing, though moments of the storyline seem a bit flawed and uninteresting for it to have received so much attention from movie lovers at one point.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>"There Will Be Blood" is an excellent example of what a director can do when he grafts together epic literary tales ("King Lear", "Oedipus Rex") and compacts them into one tragic tale.  Paul Thomas Anderson must have had a lot of fun (maybe) skimming the proverbial froth from innumerable tales of the tragic "great" man and transforming them into this tour de force of tragedy.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis deserves an award for his performance as this hollow, ambitious and sadistic man who arrives on the scene with no origin.  He doesn't talk; he growls.  He doesn't walk; ravages the land he walks on with a proud aggression.  He wants money and he wants oil.<br /><br />This brings him into conflict with perhaps the most despicable character in the film (yes, more despicable than Plainview): the Preacher Eli.  A narcissistic, money hungry con artist who even physically resembles a snake, his heart does not reside in Logos or Divine Truth but in money.  One thing I did not like about this film at all was the constant mockery of the mere idea of God's existence--because there's one fraud playing a huge part in the film, Anderson has to engage in cliched Starbucks cinematic modernity?  (Which is one of the reasons "No Country For Old Men" is a better film: it is not about the madness of one titanic figure, it is about fate and the ultimate).<br /><br />Plainview, for all his considerable business skills, is essentially a demented and angry misanthrope.  I'd disagree with reviewers (Roger Ebert being one of them) who saw no mercy in this guy.  He seems to care very much for his son H.W. until the end, until all the betrayals real and imagined have occured.  I had to laugh a few times when Plainview flips out, at one point telling a member of Standard Oil that he was going to "visit him at his home and cut his throat in the middle of the night": all the guy did was suggest that, as a millionaire, he could devote more of his time to his son.  His spontaneous convulsions of rage are both amusing and horrifying.<br /><br />I expected something to change in Plainview's fate midway through the movie for some reason.  It never did.  Things get worse and worse until he is finally worse off, even, than Charles Foster Kane.  And more dangerous.<br /><br />A finely crafted movie.  Definitely destined to become a cult classic.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>I'm not sure where to begin this review.  I usually start with a summary of whatever I'm reviewing (movie, book, CD), and then go into my thoughts on it.  But how do I summarize this movie?  Daniel Plainview becomes an oil man and is determined to keep his position, no matter what the cost?  Anyone who's seen this film can tell you that such a statement barely summarizes the plot of "There Will Be Blood."<br /><br />The movie isn't really about plot, anyways.  I mean, it's there, yes; it's a hell of a story, loosely based upon Upton Sinclair's outstanding 1927 effort, "Oil!".  But even "Oil!" wasn't so much about plot as it was about a social concern (as were most, if not all, of Sinclair's novels).  "There Will Be Blood" (it is definitely Paul Thomas Andeson's movie; he wrote it, he directed it; it doesn't feel much like an adaptation at all) is more about humanity, about one character's "growth" (I use the term lightly) as he succumbs further and further to his greed.  Daniel Plainview, as portrayed by Daniel Day-Lewis (who thoroughly deserves the Best Actor trophy he took home for this), is a downright evil man.  We are given little motivation for his evil (aside from greed; but we all suffer from that, don't we?) nor should we be given one.  I have heard people complain that the movie is dark, that it is uncomfortable to watch, that it has no redeeming features.  This is all true--thank God.  It is an honest portrayal of a dishonest man, and never once succumbs to the pressure to be a box office sensational feel-good film.<br /><br />I should say a little bit about other aspects of the movie, although if you've already seen it then such a rehash is pointless, and if you're curious about watching it you're already convinced one way or the other.  Paul Dano, as Plainview's "nemesis" (be warned: such terminology does not apply in a film such as this), is a wonder as always.  Why I've never heard of him, outside of "Little Miss Sunshine," I do not know, and is something I aim to rectify.  Kevin J. O'Connor, as Plainview's long-lost brother, is impressive; we can forgive him his turn as the comic relief in cheesy-yet-enjoyable horror fare such as "Van Helsing" and "The Mummy."  Dillon Feasier, as Plainview's adoptive son, is mesmerizing; it's rare you find a child actor with that much depth.  The scenery also becomes a star of the film; shot in part where the recent "No Country For Old Men" was filmed (Anderson and the Coen Brothers would occasionally disrupt one another's filming), the landscape awes and captivates.  The musical score underlies the depth of the film--something that's been rare in Hollywood, though as of late has been making something of a comeback.<br /><br />Have you made up your mind yet?  I can't blame you if you don't feel like seeing this movie; I was skeptical myself at first.  Even after the film, I had to think a while.  It wasn't until after a month or so that I decided that not only did I enjoy this movie, but that it is one of my favorites.  It's not an easy thing to watch, I'll admit.  Greed is one of humanity's curses; it's a primitive desire, but a powerful one.  "There Will Be Blood" is a dark, haunting look at one man's submission to his greed--and the life that it takes him through.</p></br><a href="../users/AKS9SJTHTU0OM.html">AKS9SJTHTU0OM</a><br/><p>If the early Paul Thomas Anderson seemed to be channeling the young hyper-energetic Martin Scorsese, 'There Will Be Blood' - a more quiet and thoughtful, but no less amazing and cinematic work - shows Anderson working in the vein of Stanley Kubrick. In place of a hyperactive camera, there is now a coldly, brilliantly observational one. In place of empathetic if damaged characters there are now people drowning in their own poison and lies.<br /><br />He has created a film both boldly theatrical and subtly real, both broadly political and intensely personal. Complicated and intentionally confusing emotionally, with a protagonist gradually subsumed by greed, the film is full of ideas and themes, but feels more mature and focused than Anderson's earlier work, brilliant as that all was. Daniel Day Lewis is amazing, the film looks incredible (if simply shot for an Anderson film), one only sees more and more layers and meanings on repeated viewings.<br /><br />One of the more important films of recent years, this critique of the American dream - both personal, and by extension national - of success, of conquest, and of control is mesmerizing, and ultimately devastating.</p></br><a href="../users/ARFCORBCTKX1J.html">ARFCORBCTKX1J</a><br/><p>Imagine "Citizen Kane" with petroleum replacing newspapers, and you have a pretty good idea of what "There Will Be Blood" is about. Whether it's a great film is debatable. But there's no question it's an absolute knockout -- for its acting, cinematography, and music.<br /><br />"There Will Be Blood" is another in Hollywood's long line of left-wing "I hate American society" films. I love such movies (we need them now more than ever), especially when they attack fundamental American values such as greed, hypocrisy, materialism, and shallow religiosity. This one strikes with a Panzer division and cruise missiles.<br /><br />The meaning of the title is not altogether clear. I interpret it as the second part of the statement "Whenever a great deal of money is involved, there will be blood." Take it as you like.<br /><br />Though Daniel Day-Lewis's performance has been widely praised, it is, to some degree, one-note "Spock" acting with little variation in tone. Worse, he sounds as if he's channeling Jack Palance. (Other people hear John Huston.) And when Paul Dano (in an otherwise fine performance) goes into a squeally fit, he sounds like Gene Wilder groveling in front of Zero Mostel. It's surprising the director failed to catch and fix these problems, which grow increasingly irritating.<br /><br />The cinematography is not irritating. "There Will Be Blood" is one of the best-photographed color films I've ever seen. I particularly like the way detail is retained in bright backgrounds, without burning them out. The music score is also exceptional, totally "wrong", yet absolutely perfect, even the use of a terrible performance of the Brahms violin concerto (Sophe-Mutter + HvK).<br /><br />One obvious question might be... Given the subject matter, is "There Will Be Blood" as good as "Citizen Kane"? Nope, because the latter is (surprisingly) a far more audacious film. And Welles had the genius to add the "Rosebud" riddle, which keeps the audience interested.<br /><br />Given the highly positive critical response to "There Will Be Blood", you should read a review from a right-wing critic who not only detested the film, but utterly missed its obvious (and to be fair, heavy-handed) points. Amazon doesn't permit URLs, but go to the Wikipedia article for the film and click on footnote 31, to read Armond White's review.<br /><br />"There Will Be Blood" would barely rank a PG rating, if it weren't for a brutal (though not particularly graphic) murder near the end. Whether it's enough to justify an R, I don't know. But it's the kind of film teenagers /ought/ to see (especially those belonging to Young Republicans), so parents shouldn't hesitate to let them watch.<br /><br />The Blu-ray transfer is magnificent, of almost-demo quality.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>I struggled, thinking, okay, it's a four star, sometimes five star film, but the ending, the motivation of the characters and overt violence did the film in. Three stars for beautiful cinemotography and a mesmerizing Danial-Day Lewis, an interesting take on the early oil business, but that's about it. Depressing really!</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>At the end of 2009, critics began releasing their "Best Films of the Decade" lists and There Will Be Blood was number one for both Peter Travers and Michael Phillips, among others. It would be to bold of me to call this one of the decade's best films, but what director Paul Thomas Anderson has created with There Will Be Blood is a big, grand film rarely seen today with a towering performance by its star Daniel Day-Lewis.<br /><br />I do not need to divulge the plot to you. Day-Lewis plays oilman Daniel Plainview and Paul Dano plays fire-and-brimstone preacher Eli Sunday. I could describe the plot for you, but it's unnecessary, not simply because you likely already know about it but because this is a film that is not about plot...It's about evoking time, character, and emotions. No dialogue is spoken in the film for the first 14 minutes and it's remarkable what Anderson is able to express simply through images.<br /><br />Paul Thomas Anderson, never without ambition, was at his most ambitious with this film. Working with a vast landscape and a brilliant cinematographer (Robert Elswit, who won an Academy Award for his work here), Anderson easily evokes the early 1900s that a man like Plainview would inhabit and he doesn't mind taking a moment to linger on the vast setting he's working with. Jonny Greenwood's musical score is so unique and fits this film so well; it's larger-than-life, epic, and sinister. Anderson immerses his audience so completely into this time, this atmosphere, and it's Greenwood's score dictates the mood...It's masterfully made, but it's not just the workings behind the camera that made this film receive its acclaim.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis won his second Academy Award for this film and rarely has an actor delivered a screen performance of this caliber. This is a performance that transcends mere acting, where Day-Lewis is (and not for the first time) not just playing Daniel Plainview but becoming the man. It's much more of a transformation than a performance and it's one of the more fascinating performances I've ever seen. The voice, mannerisms, and the insanity he's capable of expressing with a single look is remarkable. Hardly anything Day-Lewis brings to this character suggests he's acting and it's no small feat to make such a towering, larger-than-life figure wholly believable and real. Who else could have brought such intensity and believability to the "milkshake" speech?<br /><br />Dano is effective too as both Paul Sunday and Eli Sunday and he stands his ground against Day-Lewis. There isn't a weak link anywhere in the performances, but it's Day-Lewis' show and he keeps his stranglehold on it throughout.<br /><br />There Will Be Blood is only three years old, but it can already be evaluated as timeless. There's such a grand scope of creative vision at work here that the film's faults (if it has any) can't be picked up on with the naked eye. The film is a masterpiece, one that grows richer with repeat viewings and it's one of the few films I know will still be watched and discussed thirty years from now.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Part of me was not looking forward to "There Will Be Blood", the latest from Paul Thomas Anderson who did "Boogie Nights" and "Magnolia". Part of it is that a lot of times the films come across as slightly pretentious; as if the film is genuinely a classic right out of the gate and anyone who says otherwise just doesn't know movies or hasn't seen it enough to fully appreciate it. However, I will admit the guy does have filmmaking talent and screenplay-wise, he writes very sharply and even in complex matters and with his latest, you can see that there is a solid filmmaker underneath here and indeed many were calling the film the best of 2007, but after 3 viewings, I still think there's promise but not a fully realized film here.<br /><br />The film takes place in the late 19th/20th century where self-made oilman Daniel Plainview has been going from place to place making promises and drilling in the ground for lucrative and money-making oil deposits. With his adoptive son, H.W., Daniel is quite ambitious and committed to his successes and amassing of wealth so when Paul Sunday of the town of Little Boston arrives with talks of an untapped oil deposit, Daniel and his son head down there only to find a problem in Eli Sunday, Paul's brother, who can sell and promote his church just as well as Daniel's love for oil and money.<br /><br />I recently saw Magnolia again, which was a film on first viewing I didn't really care for, but deciding to revisit it, I thought I'd at least give it another shot and while it still had its problems, I liked it slightly more. The same thing happened with this film where its pacing and length problems weren't as glaring and it's lack of a compelling narrative wasn't as troublesome. Ultimately, the film is more a character study than anything as we see a character get more demanding, oppressive and quite foregone. The comparisons to "Citizen Kane" are well founded and while the film did keep me interesting, there were other times where I felt it wasn't as compelling as it should've been.<br /><br />Every year there tends to be one of those performances where it's kind of obvious they're going to win so it was without shock that Daniel Day-Lewis won, who's utterly convincing and explosive who's quite comfortable slipping into his darker half. We have Paul Dano who holds his own despite the age difference (although his choking cat impression during a sermon is unintentionally funny, as well as Day-Lewis' "drainage!" line). Aside from H.W., and a role by Kevin J. O'Connor who's best known for comedic roles in "the Mummy" and "Deep Rising", everyone is kind of set dressing.<br /><br />Where the film stumbles a bit is in its score. Nothing wrong with it and some scenes work quite well but there's one sound, an irritating crescendo dissonance that opens the film and re-appears, is grating and in other scenes it doesn't quite match up. Then there's the ending scene which takes place in, of all places, a bowling alley, with unintentionally funny parts and a weird use of the word "milkshake". A subplot is needed for story and character but it still extends its length to dragging levels. But then its near-wordless opening sequence, a spectacular setpiece involving a derrick fire and Day-Lewis' performance keep you interested.<br /><br />Its less-than-stellar assortments of goodies aside, There Will Be Blood is indeed a worthy watch, however, I'm not going to call it an outright masterpiece because everyone says it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>Actors can be divided up into two categories: Of coarse there are good actors. More interestingly, there are actors that are generally considered to be good, maybe really are good, and then the category in which Daniel Day-Lewis belongs.<br /><br />Indeed there is many a fine actor that has worked in the movies and are famous and loved for their great performances. Often these actors are always quite recognizable in whatever role, however different from the last, that we find them in. No doubt you can come up with your own very long list of these performers! I don't know that there is anything all that wrong with that. There is this much smaller group of performers out there that achieve what is actually the ultimate goal of their particular craft. These performers disappear into the role and what you see on the screen is only the character. Your attention goes to the character and to such an extent that you find yourself amazed that this is the same actor that you'd seen in previous roles.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis actually reminds me of the great director Stanley Kubrick. They are masters of their art. You could at times not help but wish they'd give us more in terms of their output because they're just so damn good -- and by *good* I mean about as perfect as a person can be in doing what they do. You realize though, that your maybe getting a little greedy because when they worked they put *everything* they had into it. Kubrick is gone and we have to live with the fact that we'll not get anymore more Kubrick films. But in all probability we will see -albeit barely recognizably, Daniel Day-Lewis practicing his craft, taking the form of another  character.<br /><br />Watch MY LEFT FOOT, THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS, GANGS OF NEW YORK, THERE WILL BE BLOOD and tell me there is a better actor in the world now.</p></br><a href="../users/ATZ1LTONGHOP6.html">ATZ1LTONGHOP6</a><br/><p>"There Will Be Blood" tells the story of an early 20th Century oil tycoon, Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his interactions with those around him, in particular, his son and a young preacher, Eli Sunday (Paul Dano).<br />"There Will Be Blood" has received much critical acclaim and is currently ranked at #107 in the IMdB Top 250, and yet, I just can't see why. Paul Thomas Anderson is a very good writer and director, as has been demonstrated by his earlier works "Boogie Nights" and "Magnolia", but the sprawling character structure format Anderson used in his previous works, just doesn't work in this case. Instead, I just found "There Will Be Blood" to be overly long, depressing and unfocussed.<br /><br />One of the biggest problems with "There Will Be Blood" is that there just aren't enough major characters to sustain 2 ? hours of film. Whereas "Magnolia" must have had around a dozen major characters in it, "There Will Be Blood" only really has one, Daniel Plainview, and he isn't all that interesting. Daniel Plainview's character doesn't seem to change or develop at all for the duration of the movie. I think that one of the main purposes of this film is to show the interaction between Plainview and Eli Sunday (the interaction between capitalism and religion), but there aren't all that many scenes in which these characters interact and they are too spaced out to really have much of an impact (and in my opinion, don't adequately justify the ending of the film). I think that this film could have been greatly improved by trimming it down to around 100 minutes, so as to intensify the focus on these scenes.<br /><br />As with all of Anderson's movies, "There Will Be Blood" is beautifully filmed, but in a way, that makes it all the more frustrating. It's like a big, beautifully wrapped Christmas box that only contains a pair of socks. It definitely does not deserve all of the awards and nominations that it received. In my opinion, "Breach", which was released in the same year as "There Will Be Blood" and received virtually no nominations, is a much better written and acted movie (Chris Cooper was brilliant in "Breach", while Daniel Day-Lewis seemed to be almost overacting in this film) and whereas I doubt I will ever watch "There Will Be Blood" again, I suspect that my copy of "Breach" will be viewed many more times.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y0HX12MCT6OR.html">A1Y0HX12MCT6OR</a><br/><p>To celebrate my 100th passive-aggresive review shot out like projectile diarrhea out on Amazon's pages to the horror of many, I've chosen a personal favorite of mine: There Will Be Blood, where the only criticism I can find about it is the name. There Will Be Blood chronicles the life of Daniel Plainview, an ambitious miner-turned-oilman in search of fortune during the early 1900's when the industrial revolution was hitting the western United States.<br /><br />The themes present throughout the film range from family to isolation, greed to power, and creation of a town to destruction of one's mind. The whole time slowly showing Daniel's fall from grace and descent into alcohol-fueled madness in his self-percieved 'victory', whilst he's isolated himself from everyone that loved him into his hollow mansion.<br /><br />Early on in the movie one of Daniel's men dies due to a rigging accident, leaving his infant son behind to the care of Daniel Plainview. When Daniel's going from town to town offering his services he uses his 'son' H.W. to show everyone that he is a family man and not a faceless Union Oil lobbyist. As his business expands Daniel shows H.W. the tools of the trade, some tips and pointers, and is raising H.W. to be his successor. However due to another oil accident (before the insurance days) H.W. is caught in the loud pressure release of the excavation and becomes permanently deaf, unable to communicate to Daniel anymore. So what does Daniel, the warm-hearted and loving family man do? Send his son off to a San Francisco boarding school for the deaf of course! After his 'healing' from Eli however Daniel takes his son back and brings him a teacher, in order to assist with communicating.<br /><br />Near the end when Daniel is in his lofty mansion his son approaches him to tell him that he's breaking off with his father and starting his own drilling company in Mexico. Daniel takes this as a business threat and disowns H.W. right there on the spot, calling him nothing more than a cute face used for buying land. H.W. walks away and Daniel is left alone in his dark mansion, a few fleeting memories of H.W. passing through his mind, showing the audience that Daniel really did love his adopted son at some point. So what drove them apart, was it H.W. going deaf? Was it Daniel gaining all of his riches? Or did they just slowly have a falling out as H.W. matured more and grew to know his father in another light?<br /><br />Another plot point in the movie is where Daniel meets his long lost supposed brother Henry who heard about Daniel striking big and wants to offer his assistance. It is with  Henry who Daniel feels the most comfortable with revealing his deepest and darkest thoughts, how he hates most people, and wants to make a fortune to get away from everybody. The fact that Daniel trusts his supposed brother so much shows that somewhere deep down he has a sense and admiration for family bonds and trust, but somewhere for some reason he's been alienated from his own family and has a fractured family of his own. It kind of makes me laugh when I think of the scenes with Daniel, Henry, and H.W. together, a supposed 'family' when in actuallity none of them are even remotely related. Daniel eventually gains suspicions about Henry and puts him to the test to see if he's really the brother, the supposed brother who Daniel has shared his darkest secrets with has infiltrated his trust and guard. After putting Henry down Daniel is shaken to the core, knowing that his real brother is dead this is the only moment where you really see Daniel in a vulnerable state, his real family is dead and gone, and his only family is a phony act that Daniel orchestrated.<br /><br />Another major conflict in There Will Be Blood is the slow burning rivalry between Daniel and Eli Sunday, the towns local priest who rival's Daniel in his taste for money and power. Daniel and Eli both represent two opposing foundations of the United States; capitalism and religion. Daniel promises the gullible townsfolk that he'll be making everyone prospourous and rich, while Eli promises everyone that they'll be healed and receive salvation, both headstrong in their mission enough to warrant butting heads on more than one occasion, all the awhile keeping it under the noses of the townspeople.<br /><br />Eventually Daniel reaches an ultimatum from one of his prospective clients, that they'll allow him to run an oil line through their land only if he attends one of Eli's sermons and 'accepts salvation', in a great scene of Eli getting revenge on Daniel while giving the church audience a show. Daniel, in spite of bringing profit and wealth among the community, is finally confronted in front of an audience about all of his failings as a father and as a family man, triggered by his abandonment of H.W. and Henry's murder. Eli is much more enthusiastic about confronting Daniel's demons than Daniel, after Daniel threatened a union oilman's life for bringing up his family, he is left powerless due to the overwhelming number of church-goers following Eli's demands for salvation. Eli has won this round.<br /><br />Onto the final scene Daniel Plainview is woken from a liquor-fuel slumber by none other than Eli, who's apparently forgotten about the hard feelings from over a decade ago, but Daniel in his isolated alcoholic madness sure as hell hasn't, and Eli has walked right into the spider's web. Sobbing and begging for money, Eli reveals that he has gone broke and is desperate for another donation, while Daniel silently soaks up Eli's misery and despair until he erupts in a rage and bludgeons Eli to death. Daniel 'won' in a game where there are seemingly no winners.<br /><br />There are other aspects of There Will Be Blood to admire, the score itself by Johnny Greenwood punctuates the mood, creating memorable scenes, while the cinematography shows the yawning rural landscape, with all the open fields analogous with the vast potential for oil striking the United States was in at the time. There is no scene more breath-taking that I've ever seen then when H.W. is being carried away by Daniel while the oil is coming from the ground, the music, the acting, the scenery, it all molded together to what I would call the best scene of all time. When Daniel and Henry are setting the trail for the pipeline to run through the music is industrious and ambitious, and when the fifteen year time gap is shown through the melancholy violins sets the stage perfectly for the final act.<br /><br />Really I could go on and on about There Will Be Blood, this is an American classic that rewards repeat viewings, each viewing showing a subtlety in each character's behaviors, while still cloaking their true intentions and thoughts in mystery and speculation. This is not a movie for everybody, the story unfolds at a slow pace letting you get more involved in the world and despite the dumb horror movie title there is almost no blood, the violence isn't the focus of the movie, it's usually accidential and whenever there is bloodshed it's by the hands of our 'hero' Daniel Plainview. However those going in who have patience and searching for something unique will find a wholly unique and engrossing experience, going into one man's heart of darkness in the boom of the oil rise.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>When was the last time you saw an actor portray an absolutely vile and reprehensible human being and want to give said actor a standing ovation?  Folks, Daniel Day-Lewis is as brilliant as he is mesmerizing as ambitious oilman Daniel Plainview in THERE WILL BE BLOOD, a powerful film depicting the oil industry in the infancy of the 20th Century.  Over the span of about 30 years, we see Plainview transform from a smooth-talking salesman to a vicious, greedy tycoon; the common theme throughout this transformation is Plainview's utter contempt for his fellow man.  No one--not even his own blood--is worthy, especially if they happen to get in Plainview's way.<br /><br />Day-Lewis is riveting playing such an odious, contemptible character; whether he's feigning compassion or committing cold-blooded crimes he's totally convincing and believable.  This film is a one-man show, as Day-Lewis completely dominates every scene he's in--not in an overbearing manner, but masterfully and brilliantly.  That's not to say the supporting cast isn't up to par, because it is; led by Paul Dano playing a young faith healer with a most annoying girlish scream, the cast augments Day-Lewis's performance.  Honorable mention goes to Kevin J. O'Connor playing Plainview's long lost brother Henry.<br /><br />THERE WILL BE BLOOD is a finely crafted film featuring award-winning cinematography by Robert Elswit and a most haunting musical score by Jonny Greenwood.  Haunting is a great word to describe this film; stunning yet another, as Day-Lewis delivers a most disagreeable character via an exceptional performance.  See this movie!<br />--D.

It is not often that I get mesmerised by a single actor's performance, but Daniel Day Lewis' performance in There Will Be Blood truly had me riveted from start to finish, not an easy feat given the movie's 2.5 hours length. It was an amazing performance filled with depth and emotion.<br /><br />There Will Be Blood traces the rise of Daniel Plainview, a miner who soon discovers more lucrative prospects in oil. He also finds himself adopting an orphaned infant boy whom he raises as his own. The boy, H.W. [played as a kid by Dillon Freasier] is 'used' to promote Plainview's own interests by picturing him as a wholesome, family-oriented man, despite the lack of a wife by his side. Plainview zealously goes about securing mineral lease rights and his fortunes take a turn for the better when a young man named Paul Sunday [Paul Dano] shows up in his office one day claiming to know the whereabouts of an oil-rich territory in exchange for a sum of money.<br /><br />So Daniel and his son go to Little Boston, CA and not only do they strike gold in the discovery of oil but it sets the stage for an enduring conflict between Plainview and Eli Sunday [Paul Dano again], an evangelist who tries to rival Plainview for the leadership of the community, but of course Plainview is having none of that - he doesn't like sharing anything.<br /><br />Paul Dano's performance as the overly-religious Eli Sunday is filled with a simmering fervour that releases itself into loud exhortations to God and yes, Plainview and I would say that these two actors, Day Lewis and Dano are the real reasons to watch this movie. Their conflict and animosity towards each other is apparent from the first time they meet and it only gets worse as time progresses.<br /><br />The story of There Will Be Blood is multi-faceted and complex and we see how Daniel's character evolves from a simple, hardworking miner and loving dad into a ruthless businessman who acts out in violence when he is crossed and spirals into self-destruction, losing him truly precious things along the way, such as friendship and most importantly his close bond with his adopted son.<br /><br />Powerful performances, a well-plotted storyline and masterful direction by Paul Thomas Anderson - a must-watch!</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>This is an exceptional film that explores America's unique obsessions with driving ambitious industry and evangelical religion. Loosely based on Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel, Oil, the film is a stand alone excellent product that is independent of the novel. The complex subject matter can be explored because of the film's narrative structure that is chronological and straight forward story telling as well as the exceptional acting demonstrated by all the main characters. The film may be interpreted as fascinating character study and it may also be interpreted as an exploration of the darker side of capitalism encountering the darker side of evangelism.<br /><br />The film begins in 1898 with scenes of Daniel Plainview, a silver miner, discovering silver and simultaneously breaking his leg through a nasty fall down a mine shaft. We see this man literally crawl to stake his claim before he discovers oil in his second attempt at exploration. Gradually this man hires a crew and begins a series of discoveries of oil until in 1902 an accident kills a driller and Daniel informally adopts the orphaned child HW as his son. In 1911 Plainview and his business associate are approached by a California sheep herder, Paul Sunday, who reveals for a small payment where oil can be found on his family farm. Daniel and his adopted son act like hunters and visit the Sunday farm and find the claims are true. From this point a struggle begins between Daniel Plainview and Eli Sunday, the charismatic evangelical preaching son in the Sunday family. This tension builds as the Sunday family is pushed into the sidelines as Plainview's wealth and dominance builds. Multiple dramatic episodes unfold as a derrick explosion and fire leave young HW deaf. A long lost younger brother of Daniel appears only to eventually be revealed to be less than he promises. Eli Sunday establishes the Church of the Third Revelation and becomes a force that Daniel must compromise with to maintain control of property rights and workers.<br /><br />As character study, the film is exceptional. We see Daniel as a man of amazing drive and determination. He is ambitious and crafty. These characteristics lead to outstanding industry and internal corruption. He moves from a speculator who strategizes to get oil out of the ground to a man obsessed with control of the land rights of the oil fields and the maneuvers needed to outwit his competition and maintain power.  He cares for the orphan HW but his parenting skills and priorities are out of order. HW is rendered deaf in a derrick explosion and eventually Daniel is able to get him into a school for the deaf where he learns sign language allowing him to communicate. Daniel also opens up when he thinks his long lost younger brother, Henry, joins him and wishes to work in the oil field. In conversation with Henry we hear Daniel's philosophy with such comments as: "I have a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed."  He also states: "I hate most people." Later he says: "I look at people and I see nothing worth liking."  Prophetically he says:"I want to make enough money to get away from everyone."  It is with Eli Sunday that we see revealed the most amazing sides of Daniel's personality. Daniel relishes in humiliating the evangelist and his family until through the Church of the Third Revelation, Eli gains power over the local landowners and Daniel must become `saved' and part of the congregation to gain access to their land-rights. Daniel must undergo the trial of acting like his soul has been saved by Jesus so as to gain financial advantage. This humiliation further buries his soul under his unresolved inner demons and pain, twisting him further from human experience and compassion. Daniel Day-Lewis plays this role with attention to every small detail of expression which paints a frightening portrait of fierce heartless greed and lust for power driven by some inner absence of recognition of his fellowman's dignity.<br /><br />The character of Eli Sunday, played by Paul Dano, is only a bit less complex.  This young man gains power through evangelical fundamentalism and after several years of humiliation and beating from Daniel, seeks his revenge is forcing Daniel to become saved by Jesus to gain property rights. But Eli knows that Daniel is not really saved, for Eli also is prideful and uses his church as a theater to degrade and belittle Daniel when he knows Daniel is desperate for the land rights to take his oil to the Pacific Ocean.<br /><br />In addition to an astute character study, the film is also a study in American capitalism and American evangelism. We see the dark under belly of both and we see the results when the two forces clash. This is a thoughtful and exceptional film.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>I do not regard this as a great film.  Nor do I understand why Daniel Day-Lewis, a fine actor, won the Academy Award for impersonating John Huston's performance diction flawlessly.  But there you go.  People rave about this film and Day-Lewis won the Oscar(tm).  If you look back over the history of these awards you will find a lot of head scratchers that must have made a lot more sense in their time than they do today.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis plays Daniel Plainview who is a monster.  In retrospect, the world this character inhabited would have been much better off if he had simply died in the pit we see him working in at the beginning of the movie.  Plainview is a man driven by a soul emptying hatred of everything and everyone which must arise from the same regard for himself.  He is a solitary man whose only appetite is to build his business and make money so, as he later says, he can get away from everything.  We see him make no friends, he has not a single woman in his life (nor are there many female roles in the movie).  He acquires his son when a hand dies in a pit.  Rather than send the kid to relatives, he takes him on as a prop so when he tells farmers and investors that he is a family man with family feelings he has some evidence.<br /><br />How he treats the boy, H. W. he is called, shows how conflicted Daniel is.  He shows genuine delight in teaching the boy his trade and demonstrating his prowess in front of him.  But when the boy is made deaf in an explosion at a well, Daniel sends him off in a very cruel fashion because his value as a prop is diminished.  However, I think it is also because a deaf son can't fully share his world.  It is interesting that they never try to communicate by writing to each other.  Was the boy not taught to read or write?  An indication of this comes when someone claiming to be Daniel's half-brother shows up.  H.W. looks at pictures in the man's diary but holds the book so the writing is upside down and he never looks at it or turns it around to read it.<br /><br />The central conflict in the movie is Daniel's lifelong conflict with Eli Sunday, a religious zealot whose entire ambition centers on building his Church of the Third Revelation.  Daniel came to the Sunday land because Eli's twin brother Paul told him about the easy oil there.  Daniel paid him and then found a way to pay Eli's father, Abel Sunday (significance in the name? The innocent victim?), quail money (as Daniel told H.W.) instead of oil money.  You see, Daniel came to the land with H.W. posing as a man interesting in quail hunting rather than admitting he was looking for oil.  Daniel demonstrates his ability to make bitter enemies needlessly when Eli tries to strong arm his way to bless the new well.  Instead, Daniel introduces Eli's sister and blesses the well himself.  Later, Eli finds a way to humiliate Daniel (to be fair, he uses the same method to humiliate each convert).  At the end of the movie, Daniel returns the insult.<br /><br />But the grimness of the movie and Daniel's inability to allow anyone to exist outside of his own universe of dominance is a horror.  He commits tremendous emotional and/or physical violence against anyone who fails to stay within the bounds he has determined for them in his own warped mind and empty soul.  The problem is that this is a character who is so sick in the soul that he is mostly useless in telling anything but a singular horror story.  Do the writers suppose that all oil men or business men are possessed of this sickness?  I can't believe they would buy into such a childish notion.  Nearly every business person I know enjoys their success, using their work to improve the lives of others, and has great friendships.  Yes, there are exceptions, but not to the cartoonish extremes of Plainview.<br /><br />The film also wears its artiness on its sleeve.  Like a lot of middle-brow movies pretending to be high-brow art, they are clever with some interesting elements that invite a level of thought that the viewer can congratulate himself (or herself) for formulating.  However, the movie is just too ham fisted and unrealistic to be high art.  Since there are long stretches without dialog and the images during those stretches don't really do much, the musical score provides us with strong and loud cues telling us when to be disoriented, anxious, and so forth.  It isn't that the music selected isn't interestingly done, but that it doesn't form a unity and is far too obvious in its intention to be an artistic achievement.  It is more like advertising or melodrama in purpose even if the music itself is drawn from actual musical artworks.  One doesn't congratulate a commercial for using Beethoven by calling it art.<br /><br />Daniel finally gets his riches and builds a huge empty mansion that is more prison than palace.  He has all the trappings of luxury, but no appetite to enjoy them (he uses one main hall and his artifacts for target practice) and no friends to share them with.  When the adult and married H.W. wants to strike out on his own, Daniel responds with hatred, cruelty, and demonstrates how his emptiness of soul creates a world destroying vacuum for everyone unfortunate enough to come in contact with him.  At the end the conflict between Eli and Daniel becomes ridiculously horrible and the movie simply ends rather than show us Daniel either facing the consequences of his brutality or escaping them.<br /><br />For me, this was a grim film that was so unpleasant that I never want to see it again and recommend that you don't even bother with it.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>I love this movie.  DDL is wonderful in every way and satisfyingly pissy and iconoclastic.  He intentionally looks like a beautiful scarecrow in this movie.  Without DDL, Paul Dano's excellent portrayal of stinker would have been unbearable to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>Yes a movie about oil really is that boring. I'm sure all the great and wonderful themes the critics were all raving about is in this movie somewhere, ie: Greed, power, family, etc...However, it's nothing that I haven't seen before.  The movie was longer than it needed to be. The musical score felt incredibly forced and ridiculously over the top. I felt as if it was trying to ring and emotion out of the viewers. Sort of like a horror movie that is only pretending to be scary because of the loud music. That is how I felt watching There Will Be Blood. Except it wasn't scary, or engaging. In fact, for the most part, it was quite boring. Yes, Daniel Day-Lewis is wonderful in this, no question. But a man cannot make a movie. Or at least, not one with a boring premise to begin with. I am not even going to comment on the ending as there are plenty of reviews that feel as I do. I am not going to say that this movie had no significant point, however, for such a long, drawn-out plot, it sure made it diffucult to even care about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A7P9LPMSBAAME.html">A7P9LPMSBAAME</a><br/><p>A movie of EPIC PROPORTIONS spanning a life time. Greed, paranoia, religion, false pride, dishonor, deception, control, corruption, abandonment, and murder are primary in the life of an early day oilman played by LEWIS. Not pleasant, BRUTAL but entirely RIVETING. A WORLD WIDE AWARD WINNER. BRILLIANTLY DIRECTED by Paul Thomas Anderson (Boogie Nights). GREAT CINEMA</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>If you ever explore threads asking people to list the movies they find the most boring, you'll see that There Will Be Blood is often mentioned. I can understand why. The opening 14-and-a-half minutes doesn't contain any dialogue unless you count the occasional grunt or cry of pain. The score is often unsettling and unlike anything you would expect to hear. The pacing is slow and the film has plenty of painful scenes.<br /><br />The opening scene is set in 1898 and gives us immediate insight into the character of Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis). We see him working alone, prospecting for oil. It's a physically demanding occupation which is full of danger. One small lapse can cause a severe injury or even death. Plainview falls down a well shaft and breaks his leg, but discovers oil in the process. We then see him crawl backwards as he slowly makes his way into town to register the find. He's one of the most stubborn and driven characters you will ever see portrayed on film.<br /><br />In 1902, he's working with a group of men, and we are reminded again how dangerous the work is. A tiny mistake results in the death of a man and Plainview adopts his orphaned baby boy.<br /><br />The story jumps forward several years and we see Plainview and his adopted son, HW, attending a town meeting. Plainview has discovered that the region contains oil and we see him making an offer to extract the oil. His argument is calm, reasonable, and logical. He's quite a salesman. He talks of other offers the town may receive and why his own proposal is the best solution for everyone. We are given the impression that he knows what he's talking about and it's difficult to resist his offer.<br /><br />When Plainview is visited by Paul Sunday (Dano), the main part of the film begins. Paul offers to reveal the location of land rich in oil and he negotiates a price for the information. Plainview visits the town and finds that the information is accurate. He begins buying up all the available land.<br /><br />The film contains a power struggle between Plainview and Eli Sunday (also played by Dano). Eli becomes Plainview's enemy immediately by negotiating a higher price for his father's ranch than Plainview expected to pay. Eli is also the town's priest and he seeks power and recognition at every available opportunity. Plainview sees him as a fake and doesn't seem to have any religious beliefs of his own, but he's forced to bow to Eli's wishes on several occasions.<br /><br />I've barely touched on the plot, but I won't reveal any more. This is a sprawling story spanning several decades. It's one of the most intense character studies that I've ever seen. You'll see how Plainview relates to other people and his adopted son. He's a ruthless businessman and it's dangerous to cross him. In one scene, we hear his honest thoughts on society:<br /><br />"I have a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed. I hate most people."<br /><br />That last sentence is spoken with irony, but Plainview makes it clear that he understands his own true character. As the story progresses, we see what obsession and hatred can do to a man when it's maintained over a long period of time.<br /><br />My knowledge of film isn't as deep as you would expect for someone of my age. It's a relatively new obsession in my life. However, I believe that Daniel Day-Lewis delivers the best acting performance I have ever seen. I didn't doubt for a moment that he was a bitter, obsessed, driven man, capable of doing anything to bring him closer to his goals. Day-Lewis is in every scene and the film wouldn't have had the same impact without his astonishing performance.<br /><br />The technical aspects of the film are also superb. Jonny Greenwood's unusual score is particularly effective. One of my favorite moments happens during a drilling accident when the percussion increases in tempo as the scene unfolds. The cinematography is breathtaking at times. There's an early scene in which Plainview and HW approach the crest of a hill and the distant landscape is revealed. It's one of several moments of extreme beauty in the film.<br /><br />If the film has a fault, I would say that the final 20 minutes don't quite match the quality of the rest of the story. This closing sequence still works, and contains a few memorable moments, but the first two hours are close to perfect.<br /><br />If you enjoy character studies that aren't afraid to take the time to tell a story, There Will Be Blood might be your kind of film. If you need action and an upbeat conclusion, then it's probably not for you.</p></br></body></html>

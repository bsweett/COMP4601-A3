The movie immediately struck me as intriguing and original; I felt myself being drawn in to the mystery and the danger and became very curious how things were going to progress. The movie was doing a great job of involving me in the story and creating the beginnings of a sympathetic concern for the characters.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving does an impressive job as the enigmatic V and Natalie Portman has an opportunity to display her acting skills in a very convincing manner as the young Evey. The scenery and overall ambience of the movie are effective in conveying the oppressive nature of life under the dictatorial control of Chancellor Adam Sutler, played by John Hurt.<br /><br />This is a dark, serious, action movie which I believe more sensitive children and adults should probably avoid. It is very effective in conveying a memorable impression of tragedy, darkness and violence which some may find hard to handle.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC.html">A1V3TRGWOMA8LC</a><br/><p>I haven't read the graphic novel (though I should) but the film is a masterpiece of execution, bringing together a tightly-knitted plot, a tremendous cast of actors and some truly memorable visuals. V is a cinematic giant that transcends the melodramatic elements that dog many comic book adaptations, and manages to tread the line of raising complex political issues while capably keeping the audience in suspense every step of way.<br /><br />The main character, "V", is a model for every citizen - unchanged, unhinged, unwavering - he stands for ideas with a steadfast motivation that's both simple and admirable, against a backdrop of a totalitarian Great Britain as a portent of things to come. V is a fine example of mode-against-type, since he never takes off his mask, and is all the more powerful for that. It's remarkable how Hugo Weaving manages to convey the entire character without the audience ever seeing his face. Similarly, Natalie Portman is perfect in her role as a scared citizen who overcomes her fear of the system and develops a sense of true freedom.<br /><br />It's a great movie that's as important as it is well-made. It also has a phenomenal soundtrack from Dario Marianelli that just lifts the soul and underscores the transformative and inspirational message of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>I just finished watching what could be considered the futuristic British equivalent of America's Independence Day. This may be the wrong take on the story but here's what I got from a first viewing.<br /><br />In V FOR VENDETTA (USA/UK/Germany-2005), a mysterious man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask, black hat and cape plans to implode Westminster Palace as a way of getting out the truth to people being oppressed and controlled through a state-run TV network. At the end of a long, trying story on the stroke of midnight on November 5th (Guy Fawkes Day), a series of spectacular explosions fells the entire building along with Big Ben, while the coda of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture plays and a beautiful fireworks display lights up the night sky.<br /><br />And to think I saw this movie totally by accident during the overnight after July 4th, not knowing at all what would happen. (Another TWILIGHT ZONE moment).</p></br><a href="../users/A38921VU3NJDFK.html">A38921VU3NJDFK</a><br/><p>V for Vendetta, a film version of Alan Moore's graphic novel, is set in a futuristic totalitarian Britain and peruses the chords of politics through the vengeful eyes of a mysterious, masked rebel-fighter known as "V". Produced by The Matrix's Wachowski brothers, and directed stylishly by then-newcomer James McTeigue, this roaring, action-packed flick manages a rare brand of intelligence and lucratively enthuses the idea that citizens run by governments are na?ve to the confines of such leadership and are too quick to conform. V for Vendetta perpetrated Hollywood's long-since-owed delivery of a film equally rich in smarts and entertainment value--somewhat of a rarity in the sci-fi and action genres, lately.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Even after multiple viewings I cannot deny that V for Vendetta has serious flaws--the scenes with Natalie Portman and V don't really click--but the film has scenes of such power and skill that it lingers in the memory far more than more accomplished but less ambitious movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A146D2LYLICNLS.html">A146D2LYLICNLS</a><br/><p>"V for Vendetta" has become among my favorite films of all time. Finally, a major Hollywood production that's intelligent and whose main focus is the story and not the special effects (usually it's the other way around with this genre). V is the most interesting, mysterious and complex character I've seen in a movie in quite some time, even if we sometimes question his actions. Everything about this movie works IMO. It's stylish, well-acted, dark, intriguing and intelligent. Forget politics - this is a fine piece of filmmaking.<br /><br />And what a great DVD release, with a flawless transfer. I highly recommend investing the extra $ and getting the 2-disc edition. The section on the history of Guy Fawkes is worth the price of admission. And here's how to access the "Saturday Night Live Digital Short" Easter Egg:<br /><br />Play the second disc. Click on "More" at the bottom to go to the second screen that features the "Cat Power Montage" option. Place the "V" cursor on the "Cat Power Montage" option and press Up. If done correctly, the image of the pair of wings at the top will turn black. Now place the cursor on the wings and press Enter to see a side of Natalie Portman you never thought you would!</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>I belive this must be a heck of a comic book, and I hope they did it justice brining it to the big screen.  I like this movie a lot, and I'm going to be digging for the illustrated graphic novel soon.  The action in this movie is fast, whitty, and very well staged.  There is quite a bit of gore, but that adds to the impact of the situation that Britain is in.  The angles of the propaganda shots, speeches, and the banners are all reminiscent of camera work done for Alan Parker's classic, Pink Floyd's "The Wall".  For yonger fan's, check out "The Wall" for a deeper appreciation.  Of course, the scarry parallels to the Thrid Reich are also sink in the realism of this film too.  This is worth buying, and a no brain renter if you do not like buying.</p></br><a href="../users/AVT9Q9PTUCDMR.html">AVT9Q9PTUCDMR</a><br/><p>I'm tired with this whole "it's a graphic novel" nonsense, when really a graphic novel is just a fancy way to say better done "comic book." V For Vendetta has lots of great Orwellian type themes, but it still comes across as far too simplistic and dumbed down for the masses.<br /><br />First of all, if you can get past the ridiculous mask and '60s mop top Peter Tork haircut of V (and why in the scene at the pub when this V guy first appears that not a single patron makes as wisecrack about the fop in the ridiculous mask is so beyond me it's mindboggling).<br /><br />The action is definitely good. The casting is brilliant. John Hurt (hey, 1984 and all) as the Orwellian leader of Britain was perfect as was the SCTV-like telescreen he talks through. The Stephens--Fry and Rea--were inspired. Again Britain seems bereft of actresses such that yet another American must play an English heroine (Natalie Portman, come on down).<br /><br />As far as the extras, all you get is a 15-minute "Making Of" which is good but spends a little too much time trying to tell us how there are parallels in this graphic novel to the post-911 world. Sorry, but I get tired of this Conspiracy 101 drivel being spewed by anyone, and the fact this movie had virtually no impact at all on people's consciousness proves that that was a stretch (unless you now count donutheads at Occupy Whatever City wearing V for Venti masks)<br /><br />It's good fun to watch as long as you leave your brain cells at the door.</p></br><a href="../users/A24F1UX8ZT5IXY.html">A24F1UX8ZT5IXY</a><br/><p>Amazingly enough, V for Vendetta winds up being quite a memorable film. It is no tour de force, the 1984 homages are ridiculously simplistic, a dull subplot mires the entire affair -- but the core message and dramatic high points of the film are undeniable. Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving both give inspired performances, backed with a surprising amount of emotional depth.<br /><br />Much of the revolutionary talk is treated in a pithy fashion, and it is very apparent that we are watching material evolved from a comic book. This is anarchism light, shirking any real discussion of the political ramifications of anything beyond totalitarian rule and its obliteration. It would have been nice and much more meaningful to have not only heard but experienced scenes that developed out of a more complex conception of the political realm.<br /><br />Yet, despite it all I found myself myself enjoying the whole thing. Realistically, I would give the film 3 and a half stars -- but extra points need be given for the ending credits song.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Guy Fawkes was an Englishman who disagreed with English politics so much that he attempted to blow up Parliament on November 5, 1605.  He was a member of a conspiracy to overthrow the government, but was captured before the plot could be completed.  Under extreme torture he revealed the names of the other conspirators and they were all hung together.  Each year in England and other parts of the British Commonwealth Guy Fawkes day is celebrated on November 5 with bonfires that burn effigies of Guy Fawkes, fireworks, and massive parties.<br /><br />Information like this is not usually needed to enjoy and understand a movie. However, when the movie is as deep, complex, and dark as V FOR VENDETTA the information above is essential to understanding the film.  V FOR VENDETTA is based upon a graphic novel written by Alan Moore.  The movie takes place in a not all that too distant future.  The world is a complex hybrid of George Orwell's 1984 and Aldous Huxley's A BRAVE NEW WORLD.  Due to a misguided war of domination, the United States is no longer a superpower and Britain is back in control with a new Empire.<br /><br />The country is led (actually ruled) by Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt).  Sutler rules the country with an iron hand and makes his ways known to the public through a variety of messages that he broadcasts via huge video screens and across the nation's television network.  The populace seems to have become addicted to amusement and spends the majority of their time watching television. They know that most of the news they hear is actually made up, but they still watch and listen.<br /><br />On a clear night at midnight on November 5th, V (Hugo Weaving) blows up the Banking Building in London.  Later in the day, he hijacks the news station and broadcasts a message to the country asking the citizens to join him in one year from the day when they will begin a revolution, eradicate Parliament, and begin things anew.  "Remember, remember the fifth of November."  While at the television station, V is joined by Evey (Natalie Portman) a woman he saved from being raped and arrested the night before.  Evey is knocked unconscious during the chaos and V brings her back to his secret lair.  As the plot thickens, Evey becomes V's accomplice as he begins killing various government officials who were responsible for secret government killings of their own citizens.  The action rises and falls like the graceful melody of a symphony until the final act when all the game pieces are put into place and checkmate is called.<br /><br />V FOR VENDETTA is based off of a comic book, but it's not like a typical comic book movie.  In most comic book movies, though there might be a great deal of character development there is a ton of action, not a great deal of dialogue, and hardly any serious thinking necessary by the viewer.  V FOR VENDETTA does have a great deal of character development, but other than that and the mask and costume that V wears, that's about the only similarities between this and the average comic book film.  The film is full of serious dialogue, witty diatribes, and monologues full of alliteration.  This wonderful wordplay just isn't amusing; it also forces the audience to think about what the speakers are saying.  Words are meaningful and have power and V FOR VENDETTA does an excellent job of illustrating this.<br /><br />Also, V FOR VENDETTA doesn't really have a traditional hero.  Though it could be argued that Evey is the film's heroine, we don't see her in action or on screen long enough to know whether she is the heroine.  Instead, we are presented with the actions of V and it is he himself that the movie revolves.  It can be argued that V is the hero because he performs some truly heroic actions during the course of the film:  he prevents Evey from being raped, he leads a popular uprising against a tyrannical dictatorship, he fights battles for the average citizens, and he salvages works or Art from destruction.  At the same time, V performs his very heroic deeds through some very dishonorable and ignoble means, for example he murders people and performs acts of massive terrorism.  Many might decide that a character such as V is too much like those who destroyed the World Trade Center and attacked the Pentagon to be a hero.<br /><br />Overall, V FOR VENDETTA is a very entertaining and thought-provoking film.  The film doesn't rely upon action to move the story along, is full of character development, and contains some extraordinary witty wordplay.  I enjoyed the movie and anyone who enjoys an action movie that requires thinking will, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>I knew I would love this movie the moment we first see V and he begins spouting lines in alliteration.  That cue right there let me know this wasn't going to be the average action film.  Of course, with all of the hoopla and news about this movie and its controversy, I never once truly thought it would be the average action film.<br /><br />In fact, to call it an action film is misleading.  It has more in line with political thrillers than other action films.  There are a couple central mysteries that the plot wraps itself around.  Each of these mysteries are investigated through various means including Stephen Rea as a detective brave enough to follow the trails.  Speaking of the cast, it is quite formidable.  V is, of course, played by Hugo Weaving who not many know off hand but will remember him as either Agent Smith or Elrond the elf.  Natalie Portman plays Evey.  In a terrific and ironic twist, London's dictator is played by John Hurt who starred in 1984, a film V for Vendetta has a lot in common with.<br /><br />V for Vendetta is about London in 2020, a time not very far removed from us, but utterly alien.  The United States has fallen from the power-country and Britain has reigned its head in a dictatorship way.  Sutler, the dictator in question, uses footage from around the world (some true some not) in order to subdue his citizens.  Citizens are told of the horrors in far off lands, the attrocities being committed.  And then is told that this "uber-protection" he utilizes is for his citizens best.  "See?  We don't have these problems here in London."  True.  But the problems there are, arguably, worse.<br /><br />V also owes a debt of gratitude to Guy Fawkes, the anti-hero who, in 1605, tried to blow up Parliament because of their laws that didn't given Catholics the same rights as the Angelicans.  In other words, the freedom to act and live as they deserved.  In 2020, 400 years after this event, the day has been all but forgotten and the citizens live in blissful ignorance that they have given up all their rights.<br /><br />What the film makers have done, though, is give us an interesting protagonist in V.  Is he mad?  Is he genius?  Is he right?  Wrong?  None of these questions are directly and the film makers leave the audience with more questions than answers as to what to think of this film.  People are drawing connections to current day situations.  I don't think this is unfounded, but instead of using the film to make a critique of our current culture, I believe they are doing something more interesting.  The London in this movie got to the way they were due to apathy and fear and allowing their government to usurp any rights and freedoms they have.  As free citizens, this movie instead evokes us and pleads with us to not let us get to that situation.  A situation in which it takes a 'terrorist' to knock some sense into the government and its people.<br /><br />A must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>As a fan of the original graphic novel, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, depth and emotional impact of this movie. Americans really need to watch this one (before it is too late), the story about a mysterious hero named V, fighting a facist regime in a future England.<br /><br />The most incredible moment in the film is the speech V gives when he takes over a state-controlled television station - this speech should be broadcast on American prime-time TV, it gets right to the point.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the ads for V, it is a drama, not an action film. Stuff does blow up real good but that is not the point of the film. The film's hopeful message that tyrannical governments fall under their own weight, great acting performances and great cinematography make V For Vendetta a winner.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>I was in the middle of writing a long, long review for this, but it sucked, sucked, sucked, so I'll try for something short.  So here it is: 'V for Vendetta' is a sharp, good-looking and solidly crafted, I dunno, action-thriller-sci-fi kinda thing.  It's far from 100% faithful to the comic, but it's closer than I'd anticipated, and manages to par things down into a more cohesive narrative.  This comes at the cost of some ideas, yes, which is too bad, but it's a necessary evil and doesn't come with out some benefits.  Personally, I thought the comic was a bit too meandering and lacked sufficient narrative thrust.  That's bound to be a problem much of the time, considering the format, but it's was worse then it needed be.  Still, some good stuff is lost.  I particularly miss V's affinity for anarchy:  Here they really make no mention of this, with the only vestige remaining being his V symbol, which is, of course, a circled anarchy 'A' turned upside down, minus the line across.  He opposes the current government, yes, but there's no discussion of what he'd replace it with.<br /><br />This was written and produced by the Wachowskis, so yes it's got some Matrix-isms, but fewer then plenty of other films, and the dialogue is rarely, though still occasionally, painful.  The action scenes are generally nicely done; I particularly like the one towards the end, which features many slow motion gouts of blood.  So many action movies are tragically bloodless...  The film looks great, creating a plausible near-future Britain  that manages to be very cold and distant without seeming to far removed from reality.  Performances are solid all around, with particular kudos going to Weaving as V.  He's most notable for the fact that his character is simply believable and not utterly ridiculous.  It would've been very easy for him to come across as such.  Portman is acceptable as Evey, and while the performance is hardly stunning there's really nothing wrong with it. (Just further proof of what a godawful writer/director George Lucas is...)  The rest of the cast are character actor types, and they're all fine.  Interestingly enough, Stephen Rea's Finch, the man who is heading the investigation of V and discovers dangerous governmental secrets in the process, is the major point of identification for the audience. (Or, he was for me.)  I liked him, so it worked, I guess.  Also, I think it's neat that this movie is filled with ugly people, all creased and lumpy and old and with bad teeth.  (Though the one major female character is still very attractive, prior to her hair being cut off, anyway.)  That just happens so rarely.<br /><br />The film perhaps dragged slightly in the final acts, but only briefly.  It's also hurt by a slightly underwhelming and perhaps overly happy conclusion, but how do you finish a story like this anyway?  The ending in the comic wasn't utterly satisfactory either, so while it's different it's a fairly lateral move.<br /><br />The controversy surrouding this film is fairly stupid.  Yes, it's Anti-Bush.  I've encountered anti-Bush sentiments before, however, so I'm not particularly shocked or impressed.  Yeah, the protagonist is a 'terrorist', but that just proves how vague and variable language is.  He blows up a couple of empty buildings and kills some people who wronged him personally all while attacking a government that is legitmately evil and managing to avoid injuring the innocent almost entirely.  In short, he's no more subersive thean a million other film heroes, and less so then plenty.<br /><br />Yeah, I'm done.  An entertaining, sometimes enthralling film.  It's not as smart or deep as it thinks it is, or as some will tell you, but it's smarter than most major films, I suppose, and is always watchable, which is what really matters.<br /><br />Grade: B</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>"V for Vendetta" is a political allegory in league with "A Clockwork Orange", "Fahrenheit 451" and "1984" although neither as compelling nor realistic as any of those films. It reminded me most of the Ridley Scott ad for Nike that ran one time, during the 1984 Super Bowl, where a young athlete flung a hammer through a television screen featuring Big Brother.<br /><br />While hardly a masterpiece, "V for Vendetta" is certainly better and more entertaining than "The Island", the last modern film I saw that addressed mass hysteria, mass mind control, and oppression.<br /><br />The hero is a masked character in a round hat and cape named V, a victim of a government biochemical experiment gone bad, who is out for revenge against those that did him wrong in totalitarian England. He manages to do things no one could realistically do -- control all television in England for his message, fight off a dozen armed guards at a time, etc. -- but still makes his point in a world where apparently everyone watched HDTV.<br /><br />Aside from getting even with the 10 people on his list, V sets out to lead a counterrevolution to regain democracy, or so he says; he appears in most scenes to be more despotic than democratic. The film revolves around his exploits, his friendship with a like-minded young woman, and the government's inability to corral him.<br /><br />The characterizations in this film are all one-dimensional, almost cartoonish, but that does not detract from the involvement or enjoyment aspects of the fantasy. It's kind of like Woddy Allen's "Bananas" played straight, without the laughs. If you enjoyed any of the aforementioned films I'm sure you'll enjoy "V for Vendetta".</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>-- in two ways. It's a great adaptation of a comic, and an adaptation of a great comic. The two factors combine to create a movie with a much more "mainstream" look than any other comic adaptation I've seen and a much better dramatic flow.<br /><br />First, the story: It's set in the visible future, in an England under some Orwellian regime with a crypto-christian edge. Agents of the regime are above the law, but not above using their power to abuse the rest of the citizenry. Our hero, V, began his the story as a human test animal in some inhuman medical experiment, but came out of it alive - mostly. Now, he's here for revenge against the sadistic crew that ran the test facility, and against the totalitarian regime that supported it. It's hardly a spoiler to say that V gets his revenge.<br /><br />V's mask is about the only real comic-y image in the whole movie. That general sense of reality only strengthens the rest of the movie, including Natalie Portman's (Evie's) imprisonment and the final computer-generated fireworks. There are plenty of surreal elements, though. Except for V's mask and maybe Evie, almost all of the faces are disturbingly asymmetric, as if the twisted faces represented the twisted minds behind them.<br /><br />Maybe the real surprise, if you don't usually read comics, is that V comes from DC, the publisher that created Batman, Superman, and their immediate kin. DC has had the Vertigo line of comics for a long time, intended to hold on to readers who outgrew the super-hero-in-tights genre (that's S-H-I-... never mind). I've enjoyed the Vertigo line, but I admit I haven't read V yet. Based on what I saw in this movie, that's about to change.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>We here in the United States have been blessed with the right to tell others what our opinions are concerning politics, religion, and other areas of life. While we may disagree with one another, we are still able to live a free life with our own beliefs and lifestyles.<br /><br />But what if that was not the case? What if, instead of living the way you wish, you had to live the way the government tells you to? What if you lived under totalitarian rule, and to speak out against your government was a crime punishable by death? What would you do then? Would you live in fear, or fight against the oppression?<br /><br />This is the question raised by "V for Vendetta," a powerful look at life under total rule, a world similar to George Orwell's "1984." The Wachowski Brothers, coming off the success of their "Matrix" films, have produced a rousing, exciting, and amazing story of one man who decided to fight against the system that left him scarred.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving gives an exceptional performance as V, who uses terrorist tactics against the government, but never against innocent people. Natalie Portman gives another fine performance as Evey, a person whose parents were murdered by the government, and who finds courage with V's help. The rest of the cast, including Stephen Rea and John Hurt, give wonderful supporting performances.<br /><br />The storytelling is fantastic, while the action sequences and visual effects are thrilling and visually-stunning.

"Brave New World" has been the ghost behind "Fahrenheit 451", "THX1138", "Gattika", "1984" and "A Clockwork Orange". Oppressive, sprawling government plows on unchallenged, until one individual decides to rebel/conform/escape. In the case of "V For Vendetta", we're talking a rebellion based on the inimitable botched plot of Guy Fawkes, on the fifth of November, 1605. A character, who we only know as "V", saves a media go-fer, played by Natalie Portman, just as she's about to be raped by two "enforcers" of the fascist government that has come to rule all of Britain and Lord knows where else, as the USA has declined into chaos and lost its position in the world. This character, a very well educated, cultured individual dead set on bringing down the Orwellian nightmare that is all around him, draws the grateful young girl into his world, giving her selective information on himself, judging her own possible inclination toward rebellion.<br /><br />This character wears a stylized Guy Fawkes "mask" 24/7, giving him a bizarre, stage-like appearance, with his permanent "expression" basically a smug grin topped by narrowed eyes. Hugo Weaving gives a terrific performance as the cultured "V", amazing you with his eloquence and style, not to mention his ruthlessness and determination in his mission. Another fine performance is given by John Hurt, as the main villain in the piece, the grand leader of the dystopic government, Chancellor Adam Suttler. Odd that the actor who played the victimized Winston Smith in 1984's "Nineteen-Eighty-Four", should play Big Brother in this piece. Natalie Portman provides a waifish, affecting visual as Evey, "V"'s essential "sidekick" in the film, but her attempt to synthesize a British accent leaves a little to be desired.<br /><br />"Blackadder" and "Wooster and Jeeves"'s Stephen Fry portrays Dietrich, a government approved wag that broadcasts his show to mollify the masses, until he decides to go after Suttler himself in one final episode of his TV show. Other actors involved are Stephen Rea as Inspector Finch and Sinead Cusack as a medical technician that has some history with "V".<br /><br />There is a Mephistophelean quality to "V" that will have you fascinated with him from the very beginning. Weaving's subtle, sometimes graceful performance, (the violent scenes are choreographed like ballet!) ought to at least have him CONSIDERED for an oscar nod! You are constantly amazed at: how well informed he is, how cultured he is, and how intelligent and resourceful and adept he is.<br /><br />But all this still doesn't counter what I think is an ending that sends a bad message. In the end (spoiler alert!) both Parliament and BIG BEN are blown up as "V" is given a viking sendoff by young Evey. This is after, in one of the opening scenes, Old Bailey is blown up as well! Somebody doesn't like Blair's Britain, eh wot?<br /><br />A VERY intriguing movie that gives the whole "1984" storyline a new spin.

Its message can - and will - easily be dismissed by naysayers as sophomoric or too "out there," or "anti-american" but there is also an earnestness here that will resonate strongly, and perhaps, frighteningly, to many viewers who will not fail to see the correlation between this fictional tale and the way the world we live in works.<br /><br />Filled with stereotypes and archetypes, "V" is unapologetic in its essaying of morality and in its strongly held sentiment that this tale is "for the people, by the people."  Brothers and writers Larry and Andy Wachowski (of Matrix fame) have infused their screenplay with the anger, confusion and hope captured in Alan Moore's original graphic novel - and it's better looking as a result.<br /><br />I truly believe that many who see "V" will be upset by it, but hopefully more of us will be inspired by its bold, blatant message and take a good hard look at ourselves and the way the world works around us and see that, with sacrifice and thoughtfulness, the world can be changed.<br /><br />As Evey, Natalie Portman is cast in something of the "victim" role, but she makes us route for her, and to her credit she goes beyond that making the transformation of her character not only believable, but in the end, noble.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving - the man behind the mask - gives a performance that can only be described as mesmerizing.  As "V" he exposes all of the strength and weakness of a character that is equal parts savior and villain.<br /><br />The physical production is beautiful in its realism as it paints a nightmarish world of the not-very-distant future (2020) and is chilling in its depiction of governmental power, socio-political corruption and, ultimately, the complacency of its citizens.  Weaving's "V" challenges, and ultimately changes all of that, as he quickly unravels the fabric of civilized society, capturing the public with his bold ideas - and with the promise and permanancy of change through rebellion and political uprising.<br /><br />Most chillingly, the film invokes the dread once feared in "1984" but with a renewed vigor that drives home the horrors Orwell foresaw, and still loom large in our comfy modern world.  Chilling?  You betcha!  For those who know the novel, there is little skimping, and, given the current world situation, one must absolutely applaud the filmmakers for "going there" as far as the ending is concerned.  This is film making at its emotional and challenging best.<br /><br />Are there flaws?  Of course there are, but ultimately "V for Vendetta" rises far above them in its presentation of a world filled with ideas that have forever been debated, and does it in a story well told, beautifully acted and full of hope for humankind.  Not bad work for a movie.  Actually, it's magnificent.</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>Alan Moore's decision to want his name off the final credits for the film adaptation of V for Vendetta now makes sense. Moore has had a hate/hate relationship with Hollywood and the film industry in general. They've taken two of his other works in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and From Hell and bollocks'd them up (to borrow a term used quite abit in V for Vendetta). Outside of Watchmen, Alan Moore sees V for Vendetta as one of his more personal works and after reading the screenplay adaptation of the graphic novel by The Wachowski Brothers his decision afterwards was to demand his name be removed from the film if it was ever made. Part of this was his hatred of the film industry for their past mistakes and another being his wish for a perfect adaptation or none at all. Well, V for Vendetta by James McTeigue and The Wachowski Brothers is not a perfect film adaptation. What it turns out to be is a film that stays true to the spirit of Moore's graphic novel and given a modern, up-to-the-current news retelling of the world's state of affairs.<br /><br />V for Vendetta starts off with abit of a prologue to explain the relevance of the Guy Fawkes mask worn by V throughout the film and the significance of the date of the 5th of November. I think this change in the story from the source material may be for the benefit of audiences who didn't grow up in the UK and have no idea of who Guy Fawkes was and what his Gunpowder Plot was all about. The sequence is short but informative. From then on we move on to the start of the main story and here the film adheres close enough to the source material with a few changes to the Evey character (played with skill that more than makes up for her Amidala performances) but not enough to ruin the character. Caught after curfew and accosted by the ruling government's secret police called Fingermen, Evey soon encounters V who saves her not just from imprisonment but rape.<br /><br />Right from the start the one thing McTeigue and The Wachowski Brothers got dead-on was casting Hugo Weaving as the title character. Voice silky, velvety and sonorous, Weaving infuses V with an otherworldly, theatrical personality. Whether V was speaking phrases from Shakespeare, philosophers or pop culture icons, the voice gave a character who doesn't show his face from behind the enternally-smiling Guy Fawkes mask real life. I'd forgiven the makers of this films for some of the changes they made to the story and some of the characters for keeping V as close to how Moore wrote him. Once V and Evey are thrown in together by the happenstance of that nightly encounter their fates became intertwined. Portman plays the reluctant witness to V's acts of terrorism, murders and destruction in the beginning, but a poignant and emotionally powerful sequence to start the second half of the film soon brings Evey's character not much towards V's way of doing things, but to understanding just why he's doing them. This sequence became the emotional punch of the whole film and is literally lifted word for word from the graphic novel. I heard more than just a few people sobbing in the theater as the scenes and story unfolded.<br /><br />The rest of the cast seemed like a who's who of the British acting community. From Stephen Rea's stubborn and dogged Chief Inspector Finch whose quest to find V leads him to finding clues about his government's past actions that he'd rather have not found. Then there's Stephen Fry's flamboyant TV show host who becomes Evey's only other ally whose secret longings have been forbidden by the government, but who's awakened by V's actions to go through with his own form of rebellion. Then there's John Hurt as High Chancellor Adam Sutler who's seen chewing up the scenery with his Hitler-like performance through Big Brother video conferences (an ironic bit of casting since John Hurt also played Winston Smith in the film adaptation of the Orwell classic 1984). I really couldn't find any of the supporting players as having done a bad job in their performances. Even Hurt's Sutler may seemed over-the-top to some but his performance just showed how much of a hatemonger Sutler and in the end his Norsefire party really were in order to stay in power.<br /><br />The story itself, as I mentioned earlier, had had some changes made to it. Some of these changes angered Moore and probably anger his more die-hard fans. I count myself as one of these die-hards, but I know how film adaptations of classic literary works must and need to trim some of the fat from the main body and theme of the story to fully translate onto the silver screen. The Wachowski Brother's screenplay did just that. They trimmed some of the side stories and tertiary characters from the story and concentrated on V, Evey and Inspector Finch's pursuit of both and the truth. This adaptation is much closer to how Peter Jackson adapted The Lord of the Rings. As a fan of Moore I understood why he was unhappy with the changes. But then Moore is also an avowed perfectionist and only a perfect adaptation would do.<br /><br />Already critics on both sides of the aisle have called V for Vendetta revolutionary, subversive, daring to irresponsible, propagandist. All because the film dares to ask serious questions about the nature and role of violence as a form of dissent. But the granddaddy question the film brings up that has people talking is the question: terrorist or freedom fighter? Is V one or the other or is he both? Make no mistake about it, V for all intents and purposes is a terrorist if one was to use the definition of what a terrorist is. The makers of this film goes to great lenghts to describe throughout the film just how Sutler and his Norsefire (with its iconic Nazi-like symbols and fundamentaist Christian thinking) party rose to power in the UK. Partly due to what seemed like the failed US foreign policy and its subsequent and destructive decline as a superpower and the worldwide panic and fear it began as a result. V for Vendetta also ask just who was to blame for allowing such individuals to rule over them. V has his reasons for killing these powers-that-be, but he also points out that people really should just look in the mirror if they need to know who really was to blame. For it was the population --- whose desire to remain safe and have a semblance of peace --- gave up more and more of their basic liberties and rights for a return to order. If one was to look at the past 100 years they would see that it's happened before. There was the regime of Pol Pot in Cambodia, Milosevic's Greater Serbia, and the king of the hill of them all being Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Inner Circle.<br /><br />Another thing about V for Vendetta that will surely talked about alot will be the images used in the film. Not just images and symbols looking so much like Nazi icons, but images from the current events sweeping the globe that has been shown time and time again in the news and written about in magazines and newspapers. The film shows people bound and hooded like prisoners from Abu Ghraib. The reason of the war on terror used time and time again by Sutler to justify why England and its people need him and his group to protect them by any means necessary. V for Vendetta seems like a timely film for our current times. Even with the conclusion of the film finally accomplishing what Guy Fawkes failed to do that night of November 5th some 400 plus years ago, V for Vendetta doesn't give all the answers to all the questions it raises. For some I'm sure this would be something that'll frustrate them. So much of people who go to watch thought-provoking films want their questions answered as clearly as possible and all of them. V for Vendetta doesn't answer them but gives the audience enough information to try and work it out themselves.<br /><br />In final analysis, V for Vendetta accomplishes in bringing the main themes of Alan Moore's graphic novel to life and even does it well despite some of the changes made. It is a film that is sure to polarize the extreme left and right of the political pundits and commentators. But as a piece of thought-provoking and even as a politically subversive film, V for Vendetta does it job well. It is not a perfect film by any respect, but the story and message it tries to convey in addition to its value as a piece of entertainment mor than makes up for its flaws. V for Vendetta more than continues the current crop of seriously done comic book fillm adaptations (Batman Begins, X2, Sin City, and A History of Violence) but it also shows that Alan Moore's work can be adapted well to the screen when given to the right people. It may not be perfect and it may not make Alan Moore happy, but it comes close and more than makes up for LXG and From Hell.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>Until reading other reviews on this site, I wasn't aware that "V for Vendetta" was adapted from a graphic novel, and certainly not aware that the author/illustrator was unhappy with the finished product. This happens so often when Hollywood gets their hands on something, and I'm wondering when they'll learn. While it's true that movies can't be word for word translations of books, nor image by image, they can still be true to the story. The only reason stories (I'm using that as a very broad term) are made into films is because the story invoked passion of some kind in its readers. Too often, Hollywood either doesn't understand what passions were invoked in the reader, how to translate those to film, or dismisses them entirely. However, oftentimes a story is far too complex, contains too many character, too many divergent plot lines, or too many ideas for a proper translation to occur. When that happens, we either find a script that cuts to the core of the story and eliminates anything that isn't absolutely essential to the story. That's where everybody has difficulty. Hollywood and the fans of the story rarely agree on what was left out, what was left in, what was enhanced - what was essential.<br /><br />It seems, according to reviews here, that the film remained essentially true to its core, and trimmed around the edges. That said, many here disagree vehemently.<br /><br />That served me fine. I didn't find gaping holes or questions, and never felt that any plot line was hurried. The film presented radical ideas in a magnificent fashion, first through a very unlikely hero (whose creation was, as usual, tragic), and second through the establishment he was fighting against.<br /><br />"V" was pursuing two things in the film. 1) To bring down the establishment, which had become increasingly totalitarian, and 2) to make those responsible for his creation pay.<br /><br />Both are radical, subversive, and vigilante in nature. Some have said that "V" is a terrorist, and in a sense, he certainly is. This is no Batman, no Spider-Man, and certainly no Superman. He is not a crusader for good, and possesses his own set of ethics - undoubtedly burned into him in his birth. While I personally can't agree with his tactics, I never found myself rooting against him. The "system" that was in place was a horrid one, and it did need to be brought down - especially by someone who himself had been "brought down" by the system.<br /><br />The acting is first rate, as are the special effects.<br /><br />As I noted in the first paragraph, stories are made into film because the story invoked passion of some sort. This film certainly evoked passion in me. It's a terrifying reminder that totalitarian regimes have existed, that some have been created virtually overnight, and how perilously close we are now to slipping backward, instead of forward.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UNMXBJSVIXFB.html">A2UNMXBJSVIXFB</a><br/><p>Movie - 4.5<br /><br />V for Vendetta strikes me as a well-scripted Chex Mix that serves as a superhero, revolutionary, and revenge movie all at once. But what makes the gunpowder treason and plot so interesting is the character of V himself and the circumstances in which his "quest" ultimately reveals a number of poignant observations. Aside from the obvious parallel between he and The Count of Monte Cristo, I particularly find the whole "rebellion against authority" theme to be a refreshing testament to the way certain governments can sometimes be a bit too controlling or ironically na?ve for their own good, which in turn can cause said revolution. This is best portrayed through the character of Evey who, along with everyone else, had conformed and obeyed to the whims of a harsh and suffocating dictatorship for so long. And as history (or even science) has proven, for every action, there is indeed an equal and opposite reaction; authority &lt;--> rebellion. But in one of the more unique twists, this revenge and rebellion is all catalyzed under the guise of a Guy Fawkes-masked vindicator whose actions also indeed can fit that of a textbook terrorist. 9/11 undertones are easily apparent when they mention the symbol of a building being destroyed and its ability to change the world for better or worse. I don't know when this graphic novel was written, but apparently the symbolism is justifiably and eerily accurate for what it's worth. I suppose it just depends on which side you're coming from and the amount of subjectivity involved when trying to observe such events. But in the end, I really enjoyed this movie for its extremely good choice in having cast Hugo Weaving as V and Natalie Portman as Evey. The only problems I had were a few pacing issues with the screenplay, that might've been better resolved with either a longer run time or more immersing musical score.<br /><br />Video - 3.5<br /><br />Presented in VC-1 with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio, I took a look at the bitrates (mostly in the high teens and low 20s) and it appears Warner Bros. used the exact same transfer from the previously released HD-DVD (aka the more inferior release). After reading the BD review of Batman Begins, I am now convinced that during the format war, some movies may have unexpectedly gotten the shaft in terms of a faithful transfer/encode. Because of the mere max capacity of 30GBs on a dual-layered HD-DVD, there wasn't as much space for as good a transfer/encode. The result: a few movies not quite meeting up to BD expectations LIKE a Batman Begins, V for Vendetta, and whatever else I might have in my library that was caught up in the war. Needless to say, while the BD presentation here is good, it's probably nowhere near as good as it could be. Colors are vivid, but not as in depth as I've seen in older, albeit newly-encoded, titles. Sharpness is around what you'd expect for an HD presentation, but some scenes looked a tad grainy and fuzzy (and not the good kind, like a Bourne Identity on BD, which by the way was re-encoded and looks great with the higher bitrates). Blacks aren't particularly deep either, which is a shame as it's a pretty dark movie. I'm disappointed, but it's better than DVD anyway...<br /><br />Audio - 4.0<br /><br />In addition, this TrueHD 5.1 track also seems to be a direct copy of the HD-DVD's. I don't have any HD-DVDs to compare, but I've heard other Warner Bros. titles with the same option, and they are remarkably more in depth than what we're given on this BD. Most of the film is dialogue and comes through very crisp (not that it should be hard), but the more action-focused scenes were lacking in surround usage. Music (one of the problems I had with the film overall) also seems less immersing than I'd like (where at least Batman Begins had a terrific score). LFEs were pretty good on a couple of scenes, though, such as the first fight where V introduces himself and that very cool montage with the dominoes. It's not quite up to snuff with other BDs having only an average bitrate between 1.6 and 2.1Mbps, but it's better than regular Dolby Digital.<br /><br />Extras - 3.5<br /><br />I enjoyed the extras, which consist mostly of behind-the-scenes footage concerning production and writing, but I felt there weren't enough. The one segment making comparisons between V and a terrorist is especially interesting, though they could've offered a little more subjectivity to the ideas and overall concepts of what this could represent in society. All features are in SD.<br /><br />Overall - 4.0<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film for its unique twist on the superhero genre -- to essentially portray the hero as a terrorist. Much like its script (which is supremely enunciated by Hugo Weaving), the cast is excellent with a special commendation to John Hurt who basically just talks on a giant TV for most of the film. But regardless, the plot itself touches upon many subtleties about authority, self-will, the power of symbolism, and its ability to withstand the test of time, be it through censorship, controlled viewing, etc. I highly recommend this for the great story. But with only an average A/V transfer thanks to HD-DVD's inferiority and the laziness of Warner Bros. studios to do a proper re-encoding, we fans of V may have to wait for an eventual double dip, along with some of their other catalog titles.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z2ZN39LL07GI.html">A1Z2ZN39LL07GI</a><br/><p>V for Vendetta from comic to movie. when you see the movie don't think it's power hero like super-man.

I'm glad I finally saw it.<br /><br />I didn't catch exactly when this story takes place, but I recall the date 2035 being mentioned, so it was at least that far in the future. Much of the world is in chaos, but England is under the iron control of a theocracy. An unlikely hero emerges who wears a Guy Fawkes mask and a black cape, and all black clothes.<br /><br />He calls himself V (Hugo Weaving), and we know of him primarily through the eyes of Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), a young woman who becomes involved with him in an unusual way.<br /><br />Everything about this story is unusual, although there are clearly elements reminiscent of other stories, both movies and books. The flavor of 1984 is in it, as well as The Count of Monte Christo, Phantom of the Opera, The Wall, and Zorro at least; you may well discover others. It was a graphic novel (i.e., comic book) before it became a movie.<br /><br />I can tell you almost nothing about it without spoiling some of the best surprises. I saw elements of esoteric initiation traditions, radical theories of mind control, political science, mass communication, and more. If it helps to understand what I'm talking about, let me just say that you may want to play it often enough to grab some of the best quotes. Or perhaps I'll look for the graphic novel.<br /><br />A movie that will live forever as a cult classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>I really liked this film. Natalie Portman does a nice job as Evie, and I really liked the character of V. Overall this is a really good movie with lots of exciting parts and drama. I would have given this movie a 5-star rating, but I was disappointed in the fact that they didn't explore V's background as much as they could/should have, since without that, the story didn't feel as well-rounded as it could have.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>I came to this film expecting great things of the directors after loving the matrix trilogy so much. Sadly I was a little disappointed, but only a little. It is OK, but very stylised and the story seems a little aimless in places (hence the 4 stars). Hugo Weaving does an admirable job portraying his characters sentiments whilst restricted by a mask throughout and Natalie Portman does a good job with a rather poor character that seems to change her temperament a touch too frequently to be believable. For fans of action movies and graphic novels this should keep you entertained, at least as you pick holes in it afterwards!!

What an appropriate message for the mass media!

As for newcomer James McTeigue, who served as an assistant director on the "Matrix films", provides a unique film that, while it drags slightly and takes time to make its point, is enthralling and entertaining nonetheless.  In a state of government that is controlled by a tyrant and is in a state of civil war, there's nowhere safe for anyone that is a possible suspect of terrorism. With corrupt leaders and crooked officers, there is only one thing that is suspected of this and that is the right to rebel against the government. Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman, "Episode 3: Attack of the Clones" and "Garden State") becomes cornered in a dark alley by several government officers who have only one thing on their mind. Luckily she is saved from the power hungry officers by a man in black that wears a Guy-Fawkes mask and whose weapon of choice is the dozen of daggers that he carries around. She's intrigued by the man in black (played by "The Matrix" trilogy's Hugo Weaving), who has no second thought of using violence as a mean of expression for his rebellious ideas, who latter has been labeled as the terrorist of the new generation and given the name "V". With her curiosity, Evey is kidnapped by V and learns of his lifestyles that he carries on. Meanwhile, Inspector Eric Finch, (Stephen Rea, in a fine supporting role) is questioning the authority of the nations dictator (John Hurt), whose face is blown up on a large movie screen as he dictates his committee, displaying his ego and attempt to be intimidating to his council. As the film progresses, you begin to learn the reasoning for V's acts of terrorism involving explosions of national monuments and the mentality that violence is the only way to rebel.<br /><br />"V for Vendetta" is not your average blockbuster film. Instead of mind blowing stunts constantly thrown at the audience, the focus is on the dilemmas on the characters. Our antihero V is out for revenge on the government that created the man he is. Using anarchy as a weapon, V shakes the people out of their oppression and takes a stand against their corrupt government. Evey, while unwillingly ends entangled into V's plan, joins V's alliance. Officer Finch starts to question his ethics of loyalty to his government, when he starts to uncover a disturbing conspiracy. While based on Alan Moore's graphic novels, the film has a distinct similarity to George Orwell's"1984". Free thought is taken away, cultures seen radical are abolished, homosexuality unaccepted, televisions everywhere watching and monitoring your conversations; Big Brother is watching. The political side plays second fiddle to much, when it should have been in the forefront all the time. There are some startling references to history; Nazi Germany, Gay Fawkes, while looking at our modern state; war on terrorism. The problem with V for Vendetta is that it's a mix affair. The beginning is chaotic and unfocused. Much like when Neo meets the Architect in "Matrix Reloaded", the Wachowski Brothers are throwing the thesaurus at you, with V spitting as many V words in one sentence. "Vendetta" takes its time to focus, though when it does really gets the gears moving in sync. First time director James McTeigue, does a strong job, with flare for great visuals and artistry.<br /><br />When your face holds the most expression and insight into a person, Hugo Weaving has a hard task of bringing expression to a man behind a Gay Fawkes mask. With great mannerisms and a commanding voice, Weaving is immaculate as V. Natalie Portman provides a fine performance as Evey, even with a shaved head she is still beautiful. Stephen Rea and Stephen Fry are both great. John Hurt is disturbing as Adam Sutler, booming with such a spiteful voice.  When the year 1984 approached, people wondered if George Orwell's vision of the future would come into fruition. With the year 2020 just around the corner, will "V for Vendetta" do the same; probably not. Though with provocative and somewhat controversial subject matter, it does raise questions, and food for thought.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>Although Alan Moore is regarded as one of the giants of the graphic novel, he has not been well served on film.  FROM HELL was a bit of a disappointment given the talent involved in the project, while THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN was simply a horror.  Until last year Moore's fellow great Frank Miller had suffered much the same fate, but 2005 should have seen the release of a great version of Miller's SIN CITY and Moore's V FOR VENDETTA.  But the subway bombings in London made the studio postpone the original November 5 release date until 2006.  Now that there is a great film version of a Moore classic, the big question is whether anyone will be able to do the same thing with the greatest of all graphic novels, Moore's THE WATCHMEN.  I pray that they won't, that they will realize to do a mini-series instead.  It is simply too complex a work not to receive the longer treatment.<br /><br />This is not merely one of the best film versions of a famous graphic novel; it is one of the finest political films of recent years.  The original political context for the novel was Margaret Thatcher's policies and the attitudes surrounding them in the 1980s.  The politics here have been updated somewhat.  Though Thatcher's policies--especially in regard to immigrants and non-whites--struck many as mildly fascist, a host of the policies and actions of George W. Bush and the Religious Right in America have impressed many as even more so.  I don't want to say that the United States is in danger of becoming a fascist state, but I will say that the kind of world envisioned by the Christian Dominionists and Reconstructionists bear startling similarities to the vision of the Nazis, only with God inserted into the center of things instead of the German people (and I write this as a Christian who is frightened by the implications of the political beliefs of some of my brethren).  If V FOR VENDETTA the novel was about the world that Thatcher's England could create if allowed to evolve unchecked, V FOR VENDETTA is a warning of where policies similar to George Bush's could take us.  The parallels are implicit throughout the film, but made explicit in a scene in which Evey is taken into the basement of Stephen Fry's character.  There they see a large poster containing a swastika along with Bush's phrase "The coalition of the willing," a blatant linking of Bush with fascism.  Furthermore, the persecution of homosexuals in the film is intended to recall the Bush administration's playing off the fear and hatred many in the religious right have for gays and lesbians.  And Prothero will remind any viewer of Bill O'Reilly or Rush Limbaugh.  And frequent mention is made of the way the fascist government has redefined words, much as the Bush administration has.  All of these elements have been subtly adapted from the novel to make them more relevant to the present situation.  (If you haven't read the novel, I strongly recommend it, but at the very least one should if in a bookstore pick up the book and read Moore's preface, where he expresses dismay over Thatcher.)<br /><br />But what if you like Bush?  Can you enjoy the movie anyway?  I think one can easily watch it and ignore the political context and have the time of one's life.  And thirty years from now people who weren't born when Bush was president would be able to enjoy it without understanding the context.  Alan Moore's mysterious V is one of the most compelling heroes of the past couple of decades, a moral anarchist in William Godwin's original sense.  He begins the film a complete mystery, a man not only without a face but without any apparent context.  The film as a whole is simultaneously constructed as a revenge narrative, as V deliberately destroys the entire system that made his creation possible, and a mystery tale, as Inspector Finch, played wonderfully by Stephen Rea, gradually unravels the cipher that is V.  There are some wonderful action sequences, but they are never allowed to obscure the fact that this is more a movie about ideas.  In many films the main point seems to be the action, with the ideas merely tacked on, but here the ideas are never less than paramount.<br /><br />I liked just about everything about this film.  Hugo Weaving was superb as V.  One of the things I most enjoyed about the Matrix films was listening to Weaving's Agent Smith converse with Neo, not so much what he said as the way he said it.  Because he spends the entire movie behind a mask, here we have to focus entirely on his voice.  Given the mask, it is amazing that he was able to pull it off.  I loved the look of V's outfit.  The design of his costume and map are very faithful to David Lloyd's original artwork.  The cast was very strong.  I've mentioned Weaving and Rea, but for a political fantasy concerning the future a la Orwell, this has a wonderful assemblage of talent, with fine actors like Stephen Fry, John Hurt, Tim Piggott-Smith, and Rupert Graves.  I very much liked Natalie Portman as Evey.  When I first heard that she was in the film I was mildly alarmed.  She bears little resemblance to Evey in the novel, but my fears were misplaced.  She is such an intelligent actress and this comes out throughout her work.<br /><br />It does depart from the novel at several points, but all in all I thought the adaptation remarkably faithful to the book.  I was disappointed that one bit was left out.  Shortly before he dies, V asks Evey to give him a Viking funeral, and she does, by sending him on the train underneath the parliament buildings.  It would have been easy to include those lines and would have required nothing additional.  I think the film is lesser for lacking those lines.  One could also debate the ending, since in the novel Evey takes on the persona of V, even donning his costume to continue his work.<br /><br />All in all, this is a highly entertaining film that I can urge anyone to watch.  It is one of those rare films that manage to combine both riveting action sequences with political commentary.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>"I know what happened; you were afraid. Who wouldn't be?"<br /><br />- V<br /><br />I bring in this qoute from the movie becuase I have to say that this movie totally blows your mind on so many levels. The character known only as "V" looks like your simple, reptative man in a mask who is either a superhero or a serial killer. I'm sure that we've all seen that song and dance before. This, in turn, makes moviewatchers afriad to go see the movie thinking that it will be unoriginal and just more of the same nonsense formula that everyonE and their cousin has already seen. This is not true.<br /><br />This story, like a good book, evolves on the screen. It unfolds and strikes purpose into the hearts, minds, and spirits of many people who have watched it.<br /><br />When me and my girlfriend first thought of going to see a movie, we both agreed on V for Vendetta in hopes that it would be unique and that it would stand out among all movies made from 1920's--to---2005. And our minds were thankfully melted in a moment of sheer nostalgia grace. This movie has a life of its own! It breathes heart and sheds tears in your soul. The perfect movie of 2006 has finally arrived, knocking on the door in the famous V persona with a rose to greet us all with.<br /><br />After the first viewing, we had to see it again imedietally and . . .were blown away for a second time!<br /><br />This movie, you should know, is not your typical action-movie-superhero story. It has a deeper meaning and an even deeper plotline. The story is mult-layered with symbols, history, operatic, and sometimes funny, scenes all mixed together in a tapestry of hope.<br /><br />The begining, middle, and ending were perfect in every way. Period.<br /><br />I have no gripes or any thing bad to say about it becuase for me it is impossible to do so. It just is.<br /><br />Whether you like the movie or hate it; it did its job in making you think. Since that fateful day, and that 8.00 dollar ticket stubb, me and my girlfriend can not shuddap about how fluidly brillant this gem of a movie is!<br /><br />We've seen it three times in all and, in all probability will go see it a fourth and fifth.<br /><br />And we will both own the dvd and watch it until it breaks from lack of oxygen from never leaving our dvd players!<br /><br />To those who don't like the movie I will say that you are entitled to your opinion but I believe that when you invest your time watching a movie . . . your head should be clear, a clean slate, if you will. All political views, likes, dislikes, and moods should be tossed out the car window on your way to the theater.<br /><br />Take this into perspective: Everyone knows that there are numerous superheroes, correct? There's Batman, Super-man, Spider-man, X-men, many more. Now, when you go to watch any of those seprate movies do you really expect for any of those movies to have character cross-overs or a relation to each other? No. Why? Becuase each of those movies exist in their own little world.<br /><br />V for Vendetta, aside from being the best movie you will ever see in your entire life, has been beaten with remarks and comments that it's attacking political views. No it's not. When you see this movie you must keep an open mind!<br /><br />This is such a good movie, it deserves its own GENRE category!<br /><br />What I liked the most about this film is that it was never corny, but always sly; never stupid, always smart; never overhyped, always reaching expectations; never predictable, always unexpected; never Normal, always original; Characters have scope, they never are two-dimensional.<br /><br />Each frame is like a comic-book panel!<br /><br />This isn't a movie, folks! THIS IS MOVING ART!!!!<br /><br />And so, on an ending note, let it be known that I could compliment this movie in explosive detail.<br /><br />This movie made me remember the fifth of November and my girlfriend as well. And we will always remember the persona of that delictably mischieviously independent masked vigilante "V".<br /><br />Just know that this movie reaches the goal of being different and memorable.<br /><br />IT OVERSHADOWS ALL MOVIES!!!!<br /><br />IT'S EVEN TEN TIMES BETTER THAN THE MATRIX!!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>In the near future in totalatrian Great Britain, the fascist goverment has taken control of the country and taking almost everyone's freedom. However, a mysterious masked avenger named V (Hugo Weaving) takes matters into his own hands as he becomes a rebel that fights against those that have disfigured him along time ago. A woman named Evey (Natalie Portman) befriends this mysterious anti-hero as she must know what he must fight against and could start a major revolution on the 5th of November.<br /><br />Co-starring Stephen Rhea and John Hurt, this powerful and startling sci-fi action drama is inspired by the brilliant DC/Vertigo graphic novel by David Lloyd of the same name. It's a thought provoking and action packed film is a visually stunning and very realistic look at futuristic society gone wrong but yet somehow someone would fight against it, the film is wonderfully written and co-produced by the Wachowski Brothers who brought us "The Matrix" trilogy and wonderfully directed by James McTeigue. The film is one of the smartest and coolest Sci-fi movies of the new century that also plays as a political statement, Hugo Weaving steals the show as the title hero in probably the best performance of his career since Agent Smith from "The Matrix" or Lord Elrond from "Lord of the Rings".<br /><br />This 2-Disc DVD offers some good extras like theatrical trailer, easter egg, a behind the scenes look of the film, three featurettes, Soundtrack info and a Montage as this is a must see movie event as it could be the "Blade Runner" of the 2000's.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KAR9G699RM56.html">A1KAR9G699RM56</a><br/><p>As a film fan, I have seen too many shabby comic adaptations, and truthfully too many films which only act intelligent, and are indeed not so.  This film dispels both of those commonplaces, and really is one of those films that a fan like me waits for, if only to remind myself why I go to the theatres.<br /><br />To set-up a basic introduction, first you need to know that this takes place sometime in the future, in the United Kingdom.  The world is very different, as the US is said to be in turmoil, while Great Britain indeed looks very powerful and strong.  Or so says their media, because in the movie's not too distant past Britain was controlled (through elections) by Sullivan (played by John Hurt) who is as much a 1984 Big Brother, as he is a president.  This is why we meet the 'terrorist' V, and Portman's character Evey, who together have both in their own way suffered under Sutler.<br /><br />Enough plot summary though, as I assure you that this movie will be worth your while.  Because once again, this film is smart and action-packed (thanks Wachowski brothers!); this is indeed too often becoming a rarity.  One more positive note, is that even though the situation is foreign (and not just by nationality), there is some commonality for all to relate to and dig into.  So, what can I say, except see it, like it, love it.<br /><br />I hope you do.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>V for Vendetta is one of those must-read comics that I never got around to reading.  I know, I know, how can I respect myself as a well-rounded geek if I don't read everything Alan Moore puts out?  I'm trying to catch up, give me a break.<br /><br />Anyway, my suspicion is that, in spite of Moore's well-known hatred of all things Hollywood, this movie does it justice.  To wit, it's the future.  The United States is no longer the major superpower, replaced by a despotic Britain that has a tight-fisted grip on its populace.  Outside, the world rages with disease (the bird flu), terrorists (including Muslim extremists), and every other ill free society offers. Well, no more.<br /><br />The people have spoken, out of fear, and they have elected Adam Sutler, played by John Hurt with all the bug-eyed spit of a self-styled dictator.  Sutler employs Creedy (Tim Pigott-Smith) as the chief of his secret service, who goes about "black bagging" people who are different: homosexuals, protestors, and comedians.  They're all fodder for black bagging and they're never seen again.<br /><br />The minions of Creedy are known as Fingers, and these Fingers have the run of Britain, including its women.  So it's no surprise when Evey (Natalie Portman, beautiful even when bald) is accosted by Fingers out for some fun.  Fortunately, a man in a mask, hat, wig, and cape known as "V" (with fantastic aplomb by Hugo Weaving) comes to her rescue.  Wielding only knives, he easily dispatches her opponents.  Then he shows her his "symphony," blowing up a building and a symbol with a shower of fireworks.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter, V takes rolls out the rest of his plan: he appears on national television to call the citizens to appear on Guy Fawkes Day (November 5).  Guy Fawkes is a historical figure that planned to blow up Parliament with gunpowder, but he was captured before he could pull it off.  Apparently, V plans the very same thing (sans capture, of course).<br /><br />In the process, Evey discovers her past as well as her future. Merely being associated with V is too dangerous to allow her to safely exist, and it's not long before she must make a choice: about being afraid, about being loyal, about being herself, and about her love for V.<br /><br />Skillfully interwoven into this plot is poor Officer Finch (Stephen Rhea) as he struggles to uncover V's background. We learn many things about V, not the least of which that he is an experiment gone awry.  In essence, he is a mistake and a success, the vengeful child of a government that created him.  V is for Vengeance indeed.<br /><br />On a visceral level, this film could just have been about the title: revenge.  But it's so much more than that.  The touch of the Wachowski brothers is everywhere, from the dialogue to the camera shots, beautifully panning, teasing, titillating and mocking with every shot, every sound, and every line.  V is an English-major's protagonist, spouting alliterations and quoting Shakespeare.  Dressed in a Guy Fawkes mask and voiced with honeyed tones by Weaving, he's instantly likable and frightening, a madcap spirit who heralds the clarion call of change.  See, now they've got me doing it!<br /><br />"V" inspires you like that. Yes, there are obvious jabs at current events.  If anything, they're too obvious.  The film doesn't need to have watchwords like "avian flu" and "terrorist" interspersed throughout.  The message comes across regardless of the setting: the price of freedom is fear.<br /><br />Give it up at your own risk.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Q15TP2FXYYMF.html">A1Q15TP2FXYYMF</a><br/><p>Having been a fan of the graphic novel for many years I was interested to see how exactly the Wachowski's intended to translate Moore's early 90's view of the future into a believable concept for the twentieth century. Despite what most of the purists may say, Moores original view of totalitarian britain has aged somewhat, and an exacttranslation of the graphic novel onto the silver screen would have been far too esoteric and inaccessable for those who had not been previously introduced to the material. What we have here the is an adaptation of the original concept of the novel, with some of the plot points rearranged and characters redrawn, in order to fit a movie format, and to better explore the intricacies of this fascist police state. Whereas moore portrayed a world where the government is in complete control, both of the nation and the hearts and minds of the citizenry, the Wachowski's have altered this somewhat. What we have now is a government that controls through deception and spin, by creating fear in the populace and presenting Anglo-christian based national socialism as the cure for all ills. This is in contrast to moores vision where the government rules by intimidation and violence, the citizens of britain are brow beaten dogs utterly submissive and incapable of thought, in this movie the populace have simply been kept in the dark and are awaiting someone to turn the light on. Enter V.<br /><br />What makes this film such a triumph is it's assertion that no matter how entrencehd a governments control becomes, there are always going to be people who question them always people who look at the world and sense something is wrong. People know when they're being lied to, know when spin becomes outright lies and are perfectly capable of standing for their own rights. Of course V's attacks act as the catalyst for this process ut the ultimate act of herosim is performed by the public.<br /><br />Yes there are better action films, yes there are better films that question the world we live in, but very few do both with such style and grace. This time the wachowski's managed to of their message without recourse to big black coats and rage against the machine music. Rebellion isn't just for angry teenagers- it must be for everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/AXFI7TAWD6H6X.html">AXFI7TAWD6H6X</a><br/><p>I never read the graphic novel that the film "V for Vendetta" was based in. I heard about the comparisons to the current political climate but I went into this film as that it was merely entertainment. I did not go in with any pre-conceived notions or political agenda.<br /><br />After the artistically disasterous Matrix trilogy (sorry, all three films were three too many), the Wachowski brothers return to the big screen with a vengenece with the explosive "V for Vendetta". The setting takes place in the future where the United States is no longer the lone superpower on the planet and is in a complete disarray. Britain has now taken over the US's role. Along the way John Hurt's character Adam Sutler has risen to power and became a totalitarian dictator. Hugo Weaving plays a mysterious figure named V who hides behind a mask. His intentions are to bring down Adam Sutler and his cronies. Natalie Portman is Evey, a young woman who accidently gets caught up in V's escapades when V rescues her from some strangers who tries to attack her.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film a bit. The action sequences and the storyline kept me on the edge of my seat. I loved listening to Hugo Weaving speak through the mask so eloquently. It was quite a departure from his villainous role in the Matrix series. I loved the diversity in the music which ranged from orchestral to modern day indie pop (Cat Power). The film isn't completely perfect. I thought some scenes tended to drag on longer than they should have been but overall I enjoyed "V for Vendetta" as a whole.</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>V for Vendetta is based upon a graphic novel by Alan Moore, which I was unaware of prior to seeing the film.  I cannot speak for the adaptation from the book but I found the film inspirational in that one understands the experiences from which the courage to face up to a totalitarian regime come from.<br /><br />The story begins some years in the not too distant future when England has been transformed into a Fascist state under the rule of a chancellor (played by John Hurt).  The United States is embroiled in a civil war (origin unknown).  The dictatorship (with overtones of Hitler) has a foot in Orwell's 1984 in describing a regime that has literally banned all freedoms but it struck me more that these are the hallmarks of all dictatorships: the cult of the leader, suppressing free speech, spying on their citizens.  The film centers on the mysterious character called "V," who is part Zorro and Phantom of the Opera (in that he is disfigured) wearing a mask of Guy Fawkes (famed for the Gunpowder Plot during the reign of James I); he is an avenger and a liberator.  The pivotal character Evey (Rachael Portman) has suffered under the dictatorship with her parents (who protested against the regime) dying in labor camps and her brother dying as a result of biological weapon released by the government to instill fear.  The key part of the story is Evey's transformation from a fearful person, who bows to the dictatorship, into a defiant freedom fighter.<br /><br />However, Evey is not the only person affected by "V."  After his initial act of defiance (blowing up the Old Bailey on Guy Fawkes' Day) all of the people are awakened into their own acts of defiance.  This is the focus of "V for Vendetta," that power is with the people to produce change.  This is true throughout history from the American Revolution to the Orange Revolution.  After seeing the film I read the reviews of some film critics who believe the film is a jab at the Bush Administration.  Lately, several films have been exploited for a political message that I think is simply not there.  Even the "March of the Penguins" became a political football when it was held up as an example of "family values!"  One can read into "V for Vendetta" what one wishes but I do not see how it can be labeled as having an anti-Bush agenda.  The point of the film is that we all have a responsibility to hold our governments accountable for what they do, not just a single figure who has the courage to stand up; we all have to be ready to make sacrifices.  For me, this is a story of the triumph of the human spirit.<br /><br />The casting is perfect on all levels.  Hugo Weaving rises to the challenge of acting behind a mask using his voice alone to bring depth to his character and Natalie Portman goes from a frightened young woman to being committed and fearless.  Stephen Rhea's Inspector Finch is an interesting everyman whose aim is to capture "V" but gradually understands the depths of the corrupt regime he is supporting, Stephen Fry has an excellent part as a television comedy show host who has much to hide and Tim Piggott-Smith is a superb villain.  Being a long-time fan of John Hurt it was enjoyable to see him again, especially since in the film of "1984" he was the victim of Big Brother.<br /><br />I was drawn into the film from the start and the 132 minutes passed faster than I wanted, and I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>This movie is perfect. What can I say? Rarely does a movie based on a comic book get it right on the level that this film does. Usually with movies like X-Men or Fantastic Four, there are so many characters and storylines that certain elements get lost or becoming confusing. That problem doesn't exist in this film. The storyline is just brilliant. It really makes you think about politics and the government that exist in the real world as well as the media. And it makes you question whether or not terrorism can ever be justified.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>The first half of this film has a great intelligent flow in terms of acting, dialogues, screenplay and background music. I loved V's introduction to the film and his dialogue delivery was very intriguing. Natalie Portman does a good job and she's proved her multidimensional side. This film has a few goofs but I'm not discussing them here, towards the second half it gets draggy and one feels the editing could have done more justice to the climax. The best scenes in the film are the ones where Natalie Portman gets a letter which she reads out and the writers' story of life is relived.<br /><br />Definitely worth a watch in the theater.<br /><br />Overall - 8/10<br /><br />ps - I liked this film more than the newspapers said I would and more than most people did.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>if Natalie Portman was a better actress.  You'll probably immediately recall her fake, pained facial expressions from scenes of maudlin excess in the Star Wars prequels (which, of course, were god-awful films, but don't get me started).  And because she appears in so many scenes, and her acting is at best hit or miss, it does take V for Vendetta down a notch.  Which doesn't mean you shouldn't see it, of course.  It's been a long time since we've had such a thoughtful, beautiful, and engaging movie like this, and even more surprising that it would come from the guys who most recently brought us (yawn) the two boring and pseudo-intellectual sequels to the Matrix.  Yep, the Warchowski brothers have written a highly literate, powerful movie that you really should see.<br /><br />Aside from Portman (who does a stretch in a dungeon and comes out looking like a concentration camp survivor -- except that she was just as emaciated before she went in ... does she eat in real life?), the acting is really first rate.  Stephen Fry is sensational as a talk show host with a secret life, Hugo Weaving gives a powerful performance from beneath a rigid mask, John Hurt is great as a power-mad 1984-style dictator, Steven Rea is wonderful as a detective with a heart, and Tim Pigott-Smith plays the stern face of evil with aplomb.<br /><br />All this aside, I can't help but believe that many people, blinded by modern propaganda, will mistake the world in V for Vengeance as a thinly veiled stab at the modern United States or the Bush administration.  It obviously isn't.  In fact, only an intellectual adolescent would mistake real totalitarianism for what's going on in the United States, but that discussion is for another place and time.  Moreover, the film also, by dwelling on homosexuality as much as it does (some attention to this is warranted given that sexual freedom is often controlled in totalitarian states, but it almost predominates), dilutes attention from the real victim of oppression:  expression in all of its forms, not just sexual.  Sadly, I think in today's world, however, freedom is more often associated with what a person does with their sexual organs than with the quality of their ideas.  Love is important, and sex is important too, but free thought and realm of ideas are what make us special ... and what we must die to protect if need be.<br /><br />All this, plus a satisfying ending.

In a post-September 11 world it is not easy to watch a film that makes a terrorist into a hero.  However, if all you see in V is a terrorist then I think you've missed the point of the film, because there is also a strong undercurrent of patriotism throughout.  V for Vendetta is set in a not-so-distant future that looks dusturbingly like a future that could easily be formed out of real-life current events.  In this future the government  has taken away basic civil liberties in the name of national security; government policies are based on fanatical religious doctine; and those who are different (gays and lesbians) are vilified and blamed for the ills of the world.  Sounds familiar, anyone?  This was also a well-cast film.  Hugo Weaving is simply great as V; and even though you never get to see his face, Weaving is able to convey real emotional strength.  Weaving is a very under-valued actor.  Natlie Portman was also great as Evey, the shy girl who comes around to V's thinking.  It says something about this film that when the final, horrific scene happens you find yourself cheered and excited.  This film is disturbing, but one of the finest of 2006.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>This movie is freaking awesome. Wehere else can you hear the 1812 overture put to such great use. Love the Guy Fawkes mask. The story is about vengeance but V is the most electrifying hero ever. This is so better than the matrix.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>`V' opened to critical acclaim as well as critical controversy.  I never got around to seeing it in the theater, and even after its DVD release it's taken me months to give it a look.  I will say that, while the film is visually engaging, I found myself wondering what all the hype was about.  `V' just never got around to grabbing my interest the way I expected it to, and with all the `Matrix' comparisons I expected a little more in the action department, but the film is sorely lacking in that area as well.<br /><br />The film circles around a terrorist named V (Hugo Weaving) who is disgusted with the country's current situation.  England is under the rule of Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) who rules by instilling fear in the eyes of the nation.  V happens upon young Evey (Natalie Portman) who unwillingly becomes his prodigy, but when a close friend is murdered at the hands of the government she becomes a little more willing to help make a statement.<br /><br />That's precisely what this movie tries to do, make a statement, but it falls short of a memorable one.  The acting too was a bit of a sore spot.  Yes, Hugo does a fine job, but he had a mask on the entire time so it makes acting a bit easier...the audience has no chance to read your face and know your phony.  Portman to me was a huge disappointment.  She seemed miscast and slightly out of her element.  She showed so much promise with `Closer' that I expected her to really soar here and I was sadly let down.<br /><br />The action and or directing this movie took are decent, and the few fight and or action sequences are highlights to the film, but they are few as I mentioned, and I expected more of them.  The movie tries really hard to make a point, to have a moral backdrop but it just doesn't come across on the screen.  I've read that Alan Moore (the writer of the graphic novel of which this movie is based) was not pleased with the film.  I've never read his novel, but I can assume (since Hollywood has a really bad problem with this) that it was drastically changed for the big screen.  Either way, I don't really understand all the hype, but this film does have it's supporters.  It's not a bad movie but it's far from the masterpiece some would have you believe!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>This is easily the best film that I have seen in the early stages of 2006. The acting is great, with the faceless Hugo Weaving playing V with great physical presence and an intelligent voice. Natalie Portman turns in one of her best performances here which shocked me to say the least.  She even looks hot bald! The visuals, music, set design, and action scenes are perfect without being overdone. This is a thinking action film, heavy with smart dialogue and interesting ideas. Some people are looking for a buried political message about our government in this movie, but it is based on a graphic novel written long ago. The government in the film has more in common with the Nazi party and Hitler than anything going on today. I will be seeing V for Vendetta at least once more in theaters and will add the DVD to my collection the day it is released.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>One of the main enjoyments of Alan Moore's graphic novel, "V for Vendetta," was the sense that it was *about* something.  Moore's visceral contempt for mindless conformity was there on every page, and even though his story had many of the standard "Big Brother" ideas, there were also several unusual and thought-provoking plot developments and ideas.<br /><br />Much of what made "V" such a fantastic graphic novel is absent from this film version, which is presumably why Alan Moore has distanced himself from the movie.  Hugo Weaving is a good choice for the character of V, with his sinister voice and acrobatic body, and Natalie Portman is another good choice as Evey, V's unwilling sidekick and heir apparent.  But these two play their parts in a modified story that is remarkably absent of any emotional heft.<br /><br />The special effects of this movie are astounding, as could be expected from the team that put together the "Matrix" movies.  Mega-explosions are handled expertly, as are several other combat and epic-vista scenes.  But special effects are not enough to push "V" into the class of great action movies.  "V" keeps the viewer at a distance from both V and Evey, even remarkably during Evey's wrenching detention scene.  This scene is the emotional core of the story and brings home the evils of Moore's totalitarian vision, but in this movie it largely feels like a hurried respite between action scenes.<br /><br />For visual appeal, "V" is a five-star production from start to finish.  But like "Van Helsing," "Hulk," or the "Matrix" sequels, "V" cannot be recommended as a great movie (or even a very good one) solely by virtue of its special effects.  At the heart of every great movie - even a great action movie - there must be a great story.  "V" takes what makes the graphic novel a special work and truncates it for blockbuster concerns.  This isn't a bad movie by any means - we're not talking "Speed 2" or "Dune" - but it is a disappointment when the high expectations aren't met.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I49HL6XR62DI.html">A3I49HL6XR62DI</a><br/><p>V for Vendetta calls into question our post 911 assumptions about war, society, politics, culture and human relations. Ever think about conspiracy theories? Ever wonder if bird flu is for real? Ever wonder if the media are in collusion with the government to distract the public from really important issues? Ever wonder what the difference between a terrorist and a freedom fighter is? Ever wonder where governmental protection stops and totalitarianism begins?

Remember, remember the fifth of November . . .</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>I've never read the graphic novel on which James McTeigue's "V for Vendetta" is based, but together with the late cinematographer Adrian Biddle, McTeigue certainly makes it unforgettable on the visual level. A sort of "1984" crossed with "The Phantom of the Opera" and "The Count of Monte Cristo" (the last of which is a major motif in the movie), "V for Vendetta" is the often gripping tale of a masked avenger wreaking havoc on the leaders of a brutal, neo-Fascist totalitarian regime in mid-21st Century England. Murderously intolerant of anyone who isn't a straight, fundamentalist Christian right-winger, the dystopia of "V for Vendetta" has parallels to those created in "The Handmaid's Tale" and "Fahrenheit 451," as well as some uncomfortable parallels to political and social realities in present-day England and America. McTeigue gleefully ransacks images from art, literature, theater and cinema to create a film that is never boring and often compelling, even when--particularly toward the end--its story doesn't make a lot of sense. The Wachowski Brothers' script is less interested in creating a cogent rationale and timeline for the story than in creating opportunities for making things fall down go boom; the final scenes, though visually brilliant, pose more questions than they answer. (Sure, the brothers are portraying a society in chaos, but the screenplay itself can't be chaotic.) It's a big help that the supporting players are some of the greatest talents in British Rep. Actors such as John Hurt, Stephen Rea, Rupert Graves, Stephen Fry, Tim Pigott-Smith, John Standing and Sinead Cusack play their roles with absolute conviction, adding immeasurably to the film's impact. As the masked avenger, Hugo Weaving works wonders with his body and voice, but can only partially overcome the handicap of the smirking, immobile Guy Fawkes mask he is forced to wear throughout the movie. As the young woman who becomes the avenger's helpmate and confidante, Natalie Portman is not as good as she was in "Closer" (a movie pretty much not worth seeing except for her), but vastly better than she was as Princess Padme in the "Star Wars" movies. In all, "V for Vendetta" is an entertaining if not totally satisfactory entry in the action-comic book movie genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F9VH8916IA40.html">A3F9VH8916IA40</a><br/><p>V for Vendetta was certainly not what I expected. Instead of getting an in your face action flick about some do gooder we get a political film about an oppressive government using fear tactics to keep its people under control. And V is out to stop them. But is V really the heroic freedom fighter we are led to believe? Or has he become an evil himself? Who is V? Is he just some random guy? Is he some lunatic? Is he Eve's father? We don't really know. And even at the end of the movie we don't have a clue.<br /><br /> V for Vendetta is set is the near future in London England. Something has happened that has left the United States in ruins and the rest of the world in poverty. In England an evil fanatic has seized control of the government. By using the fear of terrorist and diesis this new leader is able to keep the people under his iron grip. It is not a total nightmare government the way Gorge Orwell's 1984 was, but give it some time and it could get that way. Than out from no where comes V who brings with him a message of hope. He wants to start a revolution and overthrow the government. His tactic is to destroy parliament and kill the dictator.<br /><br /> Obviously this movie is very political and not for the easily offended. If you can not stand people challenging your views than by all means skip this move. It will just make you faint anyway. Save yourself the aggravation. But for the rest of us who like debating other peoples views instead of slandering them, this is an amazing film. True it does some in fact talk about the Bush administration and the war against terror but reasonable people will not go out and slander the movie just for that. I am a republican Christian who is against gay marriage, and this movie has some pointed things to say about all of that. The government is a far right extremist group that justifies its actions somehow by saying it is the will of God. They murder Muslims and gay's and forbid any religion except Christianity while they try to justify what they are doing. But this movie doesn't just say "republicans are evil bla bla bla" it make its point in a very well written way. Muslims and gays are seen as people instead as enemies that so many people seem to think they are. Extreme right wing Christian fanatics are seen as just a dangeres as Muslim extremist, as in fact they are. Of course this movie slant to the left, but it does have a good message. Like don't ever give up your freedom, no matter what. Do not allow your government to use fear tactics to scare you into letting up your liberties. Never stop fighting, and if you must die for what you believe.<br /><br /> V for Vendetta is a very good film, do yourself a favor and go see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>I just saw this movie on sunday.

It makes a great political message.<br /><br />So go see this movie today!!</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>First the plot--Imagine "Batman Begins" with the Liam Neeson character as the hero crossed with "The Phantom of the Opera" with a twist of 1984 thrown in for good measure and you've got an idea of the film "V for Vendetta". V (Hugo Weaving)is bound and determined for justice and that includes taking down the government of a man (John Hurt)who has turned England into a God fearing police state. V is on a time table to undo this government as the government is looking for him. In a TV broadcast he tells England he will take out the House of Paraliment by November 5th (Guy Fawkes Day in England)and asks the population to show their support by being there when he does it. The film though turns on the relationship between V and Evey (Natalie Portman)the daughter of two revolutionaries put to death by the government when she was a child. She represents us as she observes V and slowly comes to understand his madness. When she is saved by V from rape by members of the government she is thrown into a world she can no longer make heads nor tails of. Clearly this film isn't going to be for everyone and fans of Alan Moore's graphic novel will probably be disappointed. No matter the film manages to tell a gripping story for a mainstream Hollywood release. This isn't "The Matrix" nor is it "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen". It's better than the Matrix sequels but not quite as great as I'd hoped. It's still an entertaining film. It's clear by the vote count here that somehow I've been unhelpful. I'm not quite sure what folks were looking for here but this film did appeal to me even if it wasn't perfect.<br /><br />V may be a bit naive (when he takes out the government he believes that the people will take back power and the government will fear them instead of the people fearing the government)he's also a fascinating mixture of vigilante, hero and villan. Stylishly directed by James McTeigue (assistant director of "The Matrix" here helming his first film)with beautiful cinematography by the late Adrian Bittle ("The World is Not Enough", "Aliens" and "Thelma & Louise")"V for Vendetta" may not perfectly capture Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel but it certainly captures the spirit of it. Written as a protest against Thatcher and her government policies, "V for Vendetta" works amazingly well in this adaptation by "The Matrix" writers Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski. Featuring stunning performances and great support work particularly by Hugo Weaving, Natalie Portman, Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, John Hurt, Tim Pigoett-Smith and Rupert Graves "V for Vendetta" takes a lot of risks for a mainstream Hollywood movie in the post 9/11 world we live in but it's points are intelligent and well worth noting.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>A mysterious figure known as `V' (Hugo Weaving) begins an assault against England's government led by Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt). He saves Evey (Natalie Portman), a young woman, from the Fingermen, a covert branch of the government's police force. His first step is to attract the attention of the people and he does this by blowing up the Old Bailey, the symbol of law and justice within England, a system that no longer works. Sutler is outraged and immediately summons a meeting of his inner council, lording over them through a huge video screen. Sutler orders Finch (Stephen Rea), the leader of the police force, to find the perpetrator. As V wears a Guy Fawkes mask throughout, it is difficult to identify him, so Finch zeroes in on Evey.<br /><br />M for Message<br /><br />"V for Vendetta", written and produced by the Wachowski Brothers ("The Matrix" trilogy) and directed by James McTiegue is the latest entry in what I hope will be a continuing trend. We all know Hollywood loves blockbusters. Generally, these films are exercises allowing the filmmakers to trot out all of their tricks. Sort of like the old Mickey Rooney - Judy Garland films. "Let's put on a show" followed by a huge, elaborate musical in their backyard, or the barn, with great musical numbers, full orchestras, but little rhyme or reason. In today's Hollywood, a new film is the excuse to showcase any new special effects or stunts, showcasing the `talents' of everyone involved. Story? Story is unimportant. "Look at all of the cool crap we can blow up. Let's put on a show."<br /><br />With "Batman Begins" and now "V for Vendetta" (yes, in Hollywood, two films count as a trend. I would consider "Terminator 2" part of the trend but that was released too long ago) we see a movement to create blockbusters which also attempt to say something. "Vendetta" tries to incorporate messages about government control, some of which may be viewed as parables for our current administration.<br /><br />T for Thematic<br /><br />Based on a graphic novel, the author has removed his name from the film because he was unhappy with the thematic changes in the story. His graphic novel was created with a critical eye towards Margaret Thatcher's Tory government. I have never read the graphic novel, so I can't comment on any changes, but the film seems to be more a critique of the current British and American governments.<br /><br />There are scenes depicting wire tapping, prolonged wars, chemical experiments which may have lead to chemical warfare, spin doctors, government control in the face of paranoia, political talk show hosts and more.<br /><br />V for Visual<br /><br />The film creates an interesting visual universe blending elements of modern design, the Nazis, Big Brother, the 1940s, and "Phantom of the Opera". These ideas and images blend together far too easily and help create a world which seems a little old fashioned and a little modern. Visually, this works extremely well with the thematic elements, reinforcing the message for every two steps forwards, we take one step back.<br /><br />H for History<br /><br />"Vendetta" is set in the future, but as historians will tell you those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it. The film begins with a prologue depicting the story of Guy Fawkes, the man who attempted to blow up Parliament on November 5, 1605. Moving forward more than 400 years, "Vendetta" begins on November 4 and as soon as the clock strikes midnight, V blows up the Old Bailey.<br /><br />B for Back-story<br /><br />But we have questions and the questions need to be answered. Who is V? How did he come about? What prompted him to begin his current journey? What is Evey's background? How did the Chancellor come to rule Britain with an iron grip? These are important things for us to know, to help make these characters believable and interesting. And the filmmakers realize this importance. A considerable amount of screen time is spent portraying part of these histories; through a series of back stories and montages, we learn these things, adding depth and interest to the story. If you think about it, few dramas made in Hollywood today devote this much time to the back-story, let alone a big budget `action' film.<br /><br />O for Observer<br /><br />At one point, there may be too much back story. Because so much time is devoted to four or five various bits of history, these serve to take us out of the story, making us an observer, not a participant. We almost, not quite but almost disconnect from the story. Just as V expects British citizens to realize they need to stand up and fight for their rights, the filmmakers expect us to participate in the film. Passive observance isn't enough for this film, yet it almost gets that. One of the back stories in particular tests our resolve; it seems unnecessary to learn about a character we never actually meet the person in the film.<br /><br />G for Good<br /><br />Natalie Portman is good as Evey Hammond, the young woman who becomes V's unwitting accomplice. Initially, she is just like every other British citizen; trying to deal with the past while surviving in the present with little overt concern about the future. How does she do this? She tries to forget the past and complacently deal with the present. As she becomes embroiled in Vs plot, she begins to gain strength, to become an ally to the masked man. It is an interesting performance. Throughout a significant portion of the film, her character is imprisoned, tortured or interrogated. After this, she is still not completely committed to V's cause, the transformation continues. It is testament to everyone involved that Evey never becomes a superhero, always remaining a human being. It is her resolve, her persona that must change.<br /><br />H for Hero<br /><br />Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith, "The Matrix" trilogy) has the most difficult role; behind a mask throughout, he has to create a character without facial expressions. He does this in a manner of ways, through words, body language, and action. His hands and arms, the cock of his head, his voice, all lend to his character. On more than one occasion, he uses riddles to temporarily perplex his foes. At one point, a speech uses seemingly every word beginning with the letter `V'. This verbal exposition provides a unique, fun and interesting dimension to his character.<br /><br />More importantly, Weaving manages to convey the various complexities of his character. Technically, he is an outlaw, but we see the world he lives in, through his eyes, and realize he is more of a hero. Some of his actions may appear severe, but his character is living in desperate times. Desperate times call for desperate measures.<br /><br />S for Support<br /><br />The supporting cast is universally good, providing an interesting level to the film. Stephen Rea is the standout as Finch, the leader of the traditional police. He begins to realize the problems with the current regime, yet still must carryout his job. Throughout, we see the conflict on his face, testing him every minute, Stephen Fry is very good as a television personality hiding a secret from the world. John Hurt is suitably ominous as Chancellor Sutler, always appearing on large video screens. Tim Piggot-Smith is very good as the head of the Fingermen, the government's version of the Gestapo.<br /><br />C for Conclusion<br /><br />"V for Vendetta" is a very well-made film with a lot of ideas and messages. It is not a traditional action film. There are a few choreographed fight sequences, but the majority of the film is a drama, exploring how V and Evey will change there country, for the better, for the worse, through their actions and the actions of the people.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>"V for Vendetta" is more than just a masked terrorist running amuck in a futuristic Britain; it is more than just the quick wits of an anti-hero challenging the government; and it is far more than just the follow-up film from the Wachowski brothers.  This is a philosophical cinematic entry disguised as a blockbuster.  While most will argue that it is a poor excuse for the graphic novel (and slightly I agree) because it doesn't follow the story frame by frame, the themes are still pulled through.  Looking back into the graphic novel, the changes made from page to screen were dramatic, yet bold.  The "happy" ending in the film gives way to the more dismal, slightly uplifting ending in the graphic novel.  The main difference between the two is the lack of grittiness, one could call it realism, found within the story and missing in the film.  "V for Vendetta" the film is beautiful, watched in full HD, the sound, visuals, and colors are exactly the opposite from the graphic novel, and while comparing the two is not the extent of this review, it is an element that needs to be considered.  Alan Moore took his name off this film, reading the graphic novel will explain why.<br /><br />With that said, what worked and was miscalculated in the film?  To begin, the Wachowskis coupled with the direction of director James McTeigue captured the visual of "V" perfectly.  The mask was chilling, and the darkened question of his origins remained open-ended.  Their depiction of this masked vigilante was brilliant.  The way the shadows fell, the camera angles on his face instilled both fear and excitement for this character.  "V", with this film, became iconic.  Alas, the visual alone couldn't counter what preceded "V".  The use of Hugo Weaving's voice was, like Natalie Portman's accent, weak.  "V" was a bold character, but when he spoke, he seemed weaker and in less control.  Weaving's voice-work didn't capture the intensity that surrounds this character - and then there was Portman.  While she brought some innocence to the character of Eve (a name symbolic as well as poignant), the fading British accent continued the idea that she was merely Natalie Portman playing a character, not just Eve incarnate.  Stephen Rae was superb in his role, as always, as the tamed cop hunting for a belief he struggles with, and John Hurt was completely over the top, applauding his role as evil as outstanding.  These secondary characters, proving their might stronger than the primary ones, added much needed relief to this film, but it didn't make it perfect.<br /><br />"V for Vendetta" is a great film to sit down and enjoy two hours of crisp visuals, amazing music (look for a beautiful cover by "Cat Power"), and intense ideals.  It is a thinking film.  It camouflages itself as a big-budget action/adventure film, but all the while it is asking to you see the modern news and question our governments.  It will keep your mind occupied for hours.  McTeigue did a great job of bringing modern relevance (still tragic today) into this film to create a timeless sensation, but it still doesn't counter the disappointing acting.  As mentioned before, what makes "V for Vendetta" the graphic novel work is our characters, and as they lacked in the film - it moved it in a different direction.  Without the graphic novel, this film still works as entertainment, and slight thought - but it isn't a complete masterpiece.  I enjoyed this film when it was first released on the big screen, but watching it today - the small nuances with the characters just don't hold up well over time.  Its message is in tact, but lacks the body.<br /><br />Grade: *** out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>The Wachowski brothers <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1404202641">The Wachowski Brothers: Creators Of The Matrix (Famous Families)</a> wrote and produced their version of Alan Moore's V for Vendetta. (I understand Alan Moore dismissed it, no surprise there.)<br /><br />I watched the documentary first, Freedom.  In it, one of the speakers says that the film is a cross between Alien and 1984.  Yes, definitely Orwellian.  Alien?  Well, not really.<br /><br />"V" wants revenge for what was done to him -- he was one of many experimented on by a woman doctor who thought she was doing viral research and could not understand why the patients (i.e., prisoners, undesirables, etc.) would ignore her.  Talk about being in denial!  Lakehill Sanitarium developed a virus that was let loose on the country, which helped bring The High Chancellor to power.

Loved that line.<br /><br />Everyone in the film tries to put a spin on the violence let loose by "V".  Building explosion?  Oh, that was a demolition, here are the bribed witnesses who say so.  Get the picture?<br /><br />Natalie's portrayal as a prison victim, getting her head shaved, being dragged by her feet, hot scalding water torture -- not unlike a post-9/11 Gitmo prison, eh?<br /><br />Recommended film -- not so much for its political message which gets pounded in like a sledge hammer -- but for the developing romance between "V" and Evie.

Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving are the oddball, dream-pair of revolutionaries Evey and V, w/ a neo-fascist regime to clobber. Said regime is lead by a Big Brother-ish figure (John Hurt) who uses all media outlets as tools for mass distribution of propoganda (aka: news) in order to control, contain, and deceive the populous. If that's not enough, he also has his military, as well as his gestapo-like secret police force. Unfortunately for him, he has totally mis-judged and severely underestimated the human spirit and its hunger for freedom. V exploits / utilizes this catostrophic oversight to bring his master plan into being. Does V use violent means? Yes. Does he have a personal score to settle? Definitely. However, V's targets are each responsible for thousands of torturous deaths, and would certainly cause thousands more.

In today's day and age, it's easy to see why that would be hard to accomplish, considering how inhumane most terrorism is. This movie has a way of blurring the line between a nonviolent conscience and a radical need for change, and the fact that it was able to do that fascinated me on so many levels. There are a couple of people to thank for this: first and foremost there are Alan Moore and David Lloyd for creating the original graphic novel; then there are the Wachowski Brothers for adapting the graphic novel into a screenplay; and then there's James McTeigue for his direction.<br /><br />Of course, the cast has to be thanked as well, most notably Hugo Weaving for his incredibly effective portrayal of the shadowy bandit known only as V. What we're shown is a classic antihero character, completely and appropriately surrounded by an air of mystery (which is obviously helped by the fact that he's never seen without wearing a Guy Fawkes mask). It's very much safe to assume that he's not quite normal, both mentally and physically; he seems invincible from the way he fights, but more so, he seems incredibly cultured, not only from his expanded vocabulary, but from his interest in theater and film, as well (he's quite fond of the movie "The Count of Monte Cristo"). The only concrete insight we're given concerns one major event from his past, an event that completely shapes him into a vengeful yet important instigator of society. I dare not say what that event was, nor do I dare say whom he wishes to hunt down and destroy. But rest assured it's one of the most pivotal plot devices in this movie.<br /><br />A lot of ideas presented have been used before: this is a futuristic story (although it's the not-too-distant future) about a totalitarian government and the rebel who decides to take a stand against it. Even though that aspect is fairly unoriginal (all you have to do is read George Orwell's "1984" or see Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner" to see what I mean), the way "V For Vendetta" is told completely makes up for it, especially since it sends a message that a lot of people need to hear. That's probably why it wasn't surprising that the filmmakers included a cop (Stephen Rea as Chief Inspector Finch) who starts out loyal but gradually rethinks everything he's been told to believe. Hints of the Holocaust were added to the mix, as well, and that to me was even less surprising.<br /><br />The not-too-distant future we're presented shows us England under the dictatorship of Adam Sutler (John Hurt). It's a heavily regimented society formed from the devastation of disease and the collapse of major governments (our country is referred to as the Former United States). Maybe that's why Sutler is practically never seen in person; he's a ruler whose face is almost exclusively seen on a greatly oversized television screen (which I'm sure was an intentional tribute to Orwell's Big Brother character). To say he has absolute control over the country would be an understatement; political opposition, homosexuality, and religious freedom are all illegal and punishable by death. (Does any of this seem overwhelmingly familiar?)<br /><br />The vast majority of the population is complacent and fearful. We frequently sees shots of regular families in their living rooms watching their TVs, witnessing the government's propaganda in the form of falsified news bulletins and religious banter (delivered with style by Roger Allam as the despicable Lewis Prothero). You can see the anger and sadness in their eyes as they're being lied to from their own people. At the same time, you can see the unwillingness to do something about it; anyone who's ever faced a dilemma knows the agony of not rocking the boat when they know they should.<br /><br />Things get interesting when we meet Evey (Natalie Portman, who can finally fake a decent British accent). Her past is about as dark and painful as you might expect, and as a result, she has some intense but reserved feelings about the government. She's introduced to V in a back alley after some corrupt police officers attempt to rape her. Right away it becomes obvious that the two were meant to be allies. It's also obvious that she is intrigued yet suspicious of his beliefs and methods. What are not so obvious are his feelings for her, and they remain elusive throughout the film; he's accommodating and witty while at the same time overpowering and distant. These conflicting personalities were eventually foremost in my mind, especially after Evey is kidnapped, questioned, and tortured (but to find out why, you'll have to see the movie).<br /><br />Some may be offended by "V For Vendetta"'s unapologetic views on oppression and freedom, and they certainly have the right to feel that way. Nevertheless, I truly feel that this is one of the most relevant films of the year, especially given the issues and controversies we continuously see in the world. It's by no means just a stylized action thriller, as the television commercials may lead some to believe. Underneath it all, it's trying to convey a serious political message, one that doesn't have to be believed so much as it does have to be heard.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>Current special effects and our ability to think permits us virtually unlimited possibilities for movies.  In spite of the possibilities, rarely do film makers take full advantage of what is available to them.  Director James McTeigue and writers Alan Moore (who created "V for Vendetta" as a comic), Andy Wachowski, and Larry Wachowski have taken a concept never before seen in the movies and created a marvelous, enjoyable and entertaining film.<br /><br />Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) has used a series of wars to create a fascist government in England.  There is an inside joke in this choice of actors.  John Hurt previously played Winston Smith in the movie "1984," and he essentially is Big Brother in this movie.  The movie provides us with the history of Guy Fawkes at the very beginning of the movie.  Guy Fawkes failed in an attempt to blow up Parliament on November 5, 1605.  The character V uses a mask of Guy Fawkes to cover his face from the very beginning of the movie.  It takes little imagination to realize that V has some fireworks of his own planned.  Later we learn that V is mostly likely horribly disfigured and the mask may be to save us from seeing V as he really is.<br /><br />Much of what we learn about V comes from his interaction with Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), who V rescued from a couple of policemen that were about to rape Evey.  Unfortunately, Evey's life takes a nasty turn when she helps V.  Evey's only choice is to stay with V.<br /><br />Other than the introduction and the distraction provided by Evey, who we need so that the story of V can unfold, the remainder of the movie focuses on V and his escapades.  What wonderful escapades they are, and how bizarrely the conflict between V and Sutler proceeds.  We see little of Sutler except as an image on monitors until the very end of the movie.  The monitor is Sutler's mask.  We never see V's face, and V never directly confronts Sutler until the end of the movie.  Even at the end, the confrontation is indirect.  I dare not say more without spoiling the plot further.<br /><br />The result of the interesting progression of this movie is that of a chess game where we see the result of the moves, but the players are rarely, if ever, present.<br /><br />The selection of John Hurt as Sutler and Hugo Weaving as V was brilliant.  Hurt is absolutely sinister and nearly insane as he feels control slipping away.  Hurt executes his role with perfection, and there are places where I thought he was on the edge of frothing at the mouth.<br /><br />Weaving is casual, with a sonorous voice that borders on sinister, and yet can be incredibly romantic.  Weaving brings sadness to his role that is sensed at first in his voice.  V will do what he has to do, but it does not bring him pleasure.  He is logical in his actions and purposeful, without emotion.  V's actions were set in motion by events that happened to him, and we accept those actions as V has accepted them.  V acts like the steps he is taking are equivalent to taking out the garbage or raking the yard.  He must do what he is doing, regardless of the consequences.  His actions are the only purpose he has in his life.<br /><br />One aspect of this film has generated controversy.  Is it acceptable for someone to violently overthrow a government?  We would say no.  However, in this movie the government is no longer democratic.  Sutler is an absolute dictator.  There is no possibility for the government to be representative.  While terrorism, which is what V does, is abhorrent, a fascist government that will not permit a change in government is also abhorrent.  If there was another way to resolve the problems facing England in this movie, I am unable to see what that way was.<br /><br />If this movie makes people wonder, as it made me wonder, or if it makes people think, as it made me think, then the movie has done a wonderful thing.  This movie is creative, thought-provoking, well-plotted, and entertaining.  While this movie may have flaws, I was so caught up in the story and spent so much time trying to think about the story that I failed to spot any.<br /><br />If you enjoy thought-provoking science fiction, try this movie.  I thought it was wonderful, and look forward to watching it again.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Cinematic translations of graphic novels and comic books seem to be gaining prominence these days with "Sin City", "A History of Violence" and "Aeon Flux" as three examples of this growing genre. Here is another one adapted from a series of comic books written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd between 1982 and 1985. Produced and written by the Wachowski Brothers in their signature "Matrix" style and directed by their protege James McTeigue, the movie has a wildly inventive premise that despite its twenty-year old origins has a timely relevance in a post-9/11 world. It is indeed a comic book come to life, but it's also an often powerful political allegory that takes subtle jabs at the current administrations in both the UK and the US.<br /><br />It's all set in a dystopian London in the year 2020, a time when England has turned into a totalitarian regime under the thumb of fascist chancellor Adam Sutler. The story focuses on a young TV station assistant named Evey. On her way to meet her co-worker, TV personality Gordon Dietrich, she is caught after curfew by some thugs in a dark alley. A savior arrives in the form of a masked vigilante named V, and their ensuing relationship is what drives the labyrinth plot. Starting with the nighttime destruction of the Old Bailey, complete with fireworks and Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture" blaring over loudspeakers, V orchestrates terrorist acts in a one-man attempt to usurp Sutler. Evey is frightened but ultimately intrigued by V, as her parents were taken away by Sutler's storm troopers as political agitators. She eventually seeks sanctuary with Dietrich but then gets caught in what appears to be her own purgatory. At the same time, the tenacious Inspector Finch attempts to find V before any further terrorist acts occur.<br /><br />This apocalyptic movie dares to ask the question of whether terrorism is ever justified, and the filmmakers go about making V a scarifying but ultimately sympathetic figure. Many of the visual elements are impressive here, but various plot points do not coalesce into a coherent narrative. The Wachowskis have constructed a complex, elliptical story with so many convolutions around the various targets - the government, the media, the terrorists - that it gets difficult to keep track. Part of the problem is simply scope because the movie's agenda feels so broad as to make some of the elements feel trivial, in particular, the "Beauty and the Beast"-cum-"Phantom of the Opera" connection between V and Evey.<br /><br />On the other hand, certain passages work quite well, such as the brutalizing sequence when Evey is incarcerated and she starts to read a series of notes from a prisoner named Valerie, who has been executed for being a lesbian. There are also welcome bits of humor, for example, Evey dressed in one scene as a little girl to gain the trust of a bishop critical in allowing one of V's attacks to occur, and the Benny Hill antics on Dietrich's TV show meant to ridicule both V and Sutler. With a convincing British accent, Natalie Portman is solid as Evey as she shows both her adventurous and vulnerable sides with equal aplomb. As V, Hugo Weaving does what he can behind the confines of the Joker-style mask. In an ironic twist to his role as Winston in "1984", John Hurt chews quite a bit of scenery in the decidedly Big Brother role of Sutler. Stephen Rea makes a subtle Inspector Finch, while Stephen Fry uses his dry comic manner to good effect as Dietrich. The movie runs a bit long at 132 minutes, but it is relentlessly creative filmmaking.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Overall, I was definitely disappointed by "V for Vendetta," primarily because I was anticipating a really great adaptation of the work by writer Alan Moore and artist David Lloyd.  I was also looking forward to a movie that I would be able to use in my Introduction to Popular Culture class when it comes out on DVD because I thought it would be a nice example of how cinema functions rhetorically.  The idea that a masked figure who blows up public buildings could be a revolutionary hero rather than a murdering terrorist is a radical notion post 9/11.  But this film lacks the subtlety of the original graphic novel and makes a strategic error in foisting a conclusion to this dark tale.  The results are compelling, but not the provocative story I was hoping to see.<br /><br />After recapping the story of Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot for ignorant colonials, we cut to the future a couple of decades down the road where Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), is out after curfew in London.  She is about to be raped and probably killed by "fingermen" of the security forces when she is rescued by V, dressed in black and a Guy Fawkes mask.  He takes her to the roof top where he conducts a symphony that end with the Old Bailey blowing up.  They meet again when V takes over the single television channel to broadcast a promise that one year hence he will blow up the Parliament building (on Guy Fawkes day, of course) and asks that everyone in England who supports his cause to take to the streets that night to support his actions.  When Evey acts to protect V from the police, he takes her under his wing, and begins to educate her on his method and his madness. Meanwhile, Inspector Finch (Stephen Rea) is put on the case but immediately hamstrung by the government from being able to investigate the clues that would lead to the identity of the terrorist.<br /><br />The screenplay by the Wachowski Brothers turns Moore's attack on the conservative inclinations of the government of Margaret Thatcher into a more overt representation of a fascist government.  The insignia of this brave new world is a twisted version of the cross, and the fact that the person in charge is a chancellor recalls Hitler, as does the way the chancellor dresses.  Casting John Hurt, who played Winston Smith in the 1984 of "Nineteen Eighty-Four," as Adam Sutler, the fearless leader in this film only heightens the Orwellian analogy.  Moore and Lloyd had the evil men of the government look like ordinary bureaucrats, but this film stacks the deck so that the allusions to Hitler and "Nineteen Eighty-Four" are so obvious that of course our sympathies are with the terrorist blowing up the buildings (besides, they are not our buildings, they are English buildings; but more on that later).<br /><br />In the movie V speaks of the power of ideas and the importance of using words to persuade rather than coerce, but what really matters is blowing up buildings.  However, in the graphic novel the point was to blow up symbols.  The shift from having Big Ben be the first thing that V blows up in the book, to the total destruction of Parliament being V's ultimate goal, is rather significant.  V's final target in the book was 10 Downing Street and the final explosion is seen from the distance because the explosion is not the point.  It is the awakening political consciousness of Evey that is the soul of this film.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that the film provides, in relative terms, a happy ending.  No political diatribe worth its salt is going to warn the masses of the evil inherent in the system and then provide an ending that reassures the audience that everything is going to be all right.  The graphic novel ends with a victory, but clearly the war will continue, for at least another generation.  The movie seeks to reassure us with a Rolling Stones song (and does not even bother to play the entire song).  Moore and Lloyd wanted to enlist us, following in the footsteps of Evey as she follows V, but the makers of this film would be happy if we pre-order the DVD after seeing the film.<br /><br />For most viewers it will be the way the films resonates against current events that will be the primary point of controversy.  Relatively few will have read the graphic novel, but far more people remember September 11th in the U.S. than the 5th of November in the U.K.  The idea of purging an English-speaking nation of Muslims, immigrants and homosexuals may or may not seem like something that can happen here.  Blowing up apparently empty buildings in the middle of the night and reserving the blood letting for situations where V gets up close and personal with the bad guys can certainly make this terrorist seem different and, dare we say, acceptable.  In the end we are so clearly distanced from this story that it does not ask us to make any hard choices.<br /><br />I would have preferred to see "V for Vendetta" as a television mini-series, not only because I think an episodic approach is better suited to telling the story, but also because it is a much more intimate tale that what we see on the big screen where they go out of their way to crank up the volume on the explosions.  Beyond that, the frozen face that is V's mask becomes a disadvantage both for Weaving and director James McTeigue.  There is only so much you can do with lighting and head tilts, and the first-time director relies too often on close-ups (no wonder James Purefoy bailed on the role).  "Sin City" set a standard for adapting a graphic novel to the screen that will probably never be approached by any one else, but I was hoping this one would be a lot closer to the mark.</p></br><a href="../users/A2809U2S14N0K1.html">A2809U2S14N0K1</a><br/><p>What we have here is some sort of fascist England whose main issue seems a dislike of gay people. We also have a freedom fighter who plans to blow up the British parliment building in public view in the name of freedom. To me the story made little sense.<br /><br />The acting was reasonable. Nothing memorable.<br /><br />From the directors of the matrix, I thought the special effects were rather ordinary. I suppose I expected more from them.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"V For Vendetta" is excellent! One of the year's best!

It sounded a little lame, and the last time I saw Natalie Portman she was less than rewarding. This time, however, she captured my attention and held it like you would expect a beautiful young woman to do, though with her own twist, namely that her persona manages to speak of her humanity more strongly than her physicality. It seems Natalie has deepened her skills since The Professional. Still, the movie relies on her performance to the extent that it would have failed if she had faltered. She doesn't.<br />This movie is a towering achievement, and there's no doubt in my mind that it will be the standard in its genre for a long time to come. And if you thought Hugo Weaving a slightly odd choice for Agent Smith in his last big role, watch him win you over in this film. He does it with insight and intuition despite extreme limitations (a Guy Fawkes mask). And John Hurt is every bit as righteous and outraged as some of our real politicians, making him all too easily recognizable.<br /><br />I like this film! V may introduce himself with about 1,000 more words than necessary, but quickly, this film makes its points like some master litigator building an ironclad case. Oh I looked at my watch alright, but not to see how much more I had to endure, but how much of this cinematic miracle was left before I'd be unceremoniously thrown out into the cold, cold night. To say this screenplay is brilliant is a colossal understatement. It's almost impossible to believe any writing team could have dreamed it up, much less one where one of the team is seeking a sex-change operation in a real-life. And considering that the Wachowski brothers were responsible for The Matrix as well, I thank my lucky stars that I didn't grow up to be in competition with these guys! Quite unlike the Matrix sequels, this movie is very much the worthy of successor of The Matrix.<br /><br />A couple of after thoughts: If you've heard about the Holocaust allusions, don't worry. You're not pummeled into submission with yet another account of that tragedy. And two, I fervently hope this operation they're talking about doesn't diminish their ability to create mind boggling cinema. That would truly be a tragedy, all around.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>For a lot of people, tell them a film is based on a graphic novel -- a "comic book" -- and they immediately write it off as juvenile. Some of us know better, though. The fact that the story a movie came from appeared first in another graphic medium has very little to do with anything. You have to evaluate the film on its own merits. This one is a combination of adventure fantasy -- bigger-than-life hero vs. superbad villains -- and political cautionary tale. It's a couple of decades in the future, the U.S. has collapsed economically and politically and is mired in civil war, and England has fallen into an authoritarian, fascist nightmare, largely with the acquiescence of its own people. Into all this steps a man in a Guy Fawkes mask with a vendetta against those in power for what they did to him in his earlier life. In the book, V's cause is anarchy; in the film, it's English freedom. (Alan Moore loathed the change in theme as "Americanization," but revolution plays better in Hollywood if it's in support of democracy.) Though we never see the real, damaged face of V, the voice behind the mask is that of Hugo Weaving -- and a great voice it is, too. Natalie Portman plays Evey, the only survivor of a family that was wiped out piecemeal by the fascists, and the story also is about her climb up from constant fear. John Hurt is excellent as Sutler, the frothingly menacing Head Chancellor who glares out from an oversize TV screen like Big Brother in "1984." There are plenty of plot holes, mostly having to do with the ease with which V gets in and out of very high-security places to commit his executions. On the other hand, the Wachowski brothers also were responsible for the "Matrix" films, so you know the sfx are going to be above average -- especially the final shoot-out in the tube station and the destruction of the Houses of Parliament as witnessed by thousands of Londoners in Guy Fawkes masks. Not a bad flick, and it's obviously destined to be a cult film, but it would have been interesting to see what the Wachowskis could have done by sticking closer to the themes and details of the book.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Another graphic novel comes to life in captivating motion picture treatment. V for Vendetta is an exciting look at the post apocalyptic world created by Alan Moore and David Lloyd.<br /><br />There's suspense, intense drama, a great story...everything that you want from of good movie in the genre. Critics that say V for Vendetta glorifies terrorism should get out of the movie reviewing business and get into politics.<br /><br />V for Vendetta is chock full of good acting by good actors that is a jolt of fresh air from the stale performances that overrun Hollywood.<br /><br />Natalie Portman is great, as are the main supporting cast. Unfortunately, it might be easy to forget that this is Hugo Weaving with another awesome performance (it sure is easy to remember the awesome performances by Hugo Weaving of the feared Agent Smith in the Matrix series or of the menacing Elrond in the Lord of the Rings series, no?). Weaving's Guy Fawkes mask never comes off to reveal his portrayal of V.<br /><br />V has a vendetta. He will attempt to bring down the Fascist government created by the apocalypse. He will deal with the leaders of the fascist regime and with those that made him what he has become. The story of his endeavors is very well put together and fun to watch.<br /><br />Highly recommended for adventurists that like their action with a cool, believable story.<br /><br />Add it to your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>This is a remake of so many films, novels and historical events that we just wonder if it hasn't invented a new concept, that of the salad-bowl remake. Of course we can think of 1984 and Big Brother who has become the High Chancellor. Of course we can think of Zorro or Batman who have become V. Of course we can think of so many other films (try The Running Man for instance, or Total Recall) that have been dealing with the end of a world turned into an absolutely totalitarian dictatorship. The apocalypse of another apocalypse, an apocalyptic end to a catastrophic apocalypse. So what does this film bring us that is new ? A touch of optimism. A real change is possible when and only when the people starts moving, and the people will move if you provide them with some hope by destroying a few symbolic milestones in their everyday political landscape. Optimistic. And imagine the armed forces of such an absolutely fascistic regime not firing at the crowd that is coming unarmed and numerous. Optimistic. Is it good to have a little dose of optimism from time to time ? Maybe. Yet the film is interesting and both thrilling and entertaining. But it does not provide us with any real belief that this may happen in our world. Fascism can take over but it is always - today - in mild forms though the deeper nature is brutal and ruthless : they prefer famishing and starving someone through economic means to sending them to any concentration camp. But to revive Guy Fawkes is a real fine idea. He is so British, so English, so cute and quaint. Guy Fawkes is not even a skeleton in the British cupboard, or cabinet if your prefer. He is a real friend that we may meet at any street corner of our mind or imagination.

First-time director James McTeigue worked as assistant director in three `Matrix's and one `Star Wars' and yes, the titular `V' is played by Hugo Weaving. This time, however, you never see his face hidden behind a mask - like Agent Smith wearing glasses. And fewer action scenes.<br /><br />`V for Vendetta' is set in the totalitarian society of England in the near future, where one masked anti-hero shakes up the nation's political system which is controlled by one Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt). To do so, `V' employs a Guy Fawkes method - well, blow up the Old Bailey, you know - and he does it with accompanied music, before an accidental witness Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), who becomes the suspect of the case, chased by the secret police.<br /><br />[NATALIE PORTMAN as BALLERINA?] The far-fetched story contains as many elements as possible - actions, humors, imprisonment, and even romance - and there is always something right in front of you that is interesting to see, like the interior of `V''s room, his penchant for using theatrical manners, or believe me or not, one pinkish ballerina clothes Portman wears. The film certainly has several good action sequences, but what is fascinating may be the character of `V' himself, and the far-reaching effects that changes the life of other characters including Evey.<br /><br />To me, however, two actors from UK are more impressive than `V' and Evey. They are Stephen Rea as Inspector Finch and Stephen Fry as popular TV show host. They both represent the ordinary people who attempt to follow their conscience even under the fascist regime without using the terrorist tactics that `V' employs. And they know they are very weak, like Jonathan Pryce's hero in `Brazil.'<br /><br />Compared with them, the acting Portman looks sometimes weak, with the British accent that appears and disappears. The film's reference to one Dumas novel is too obvious, and even detracting. There is one big twist in the middle part of the film, which is not convincing, and most of all, John Hurt's `Sutler,' always yelling before the monitor, is not my idea of the fascist leader in the 21st century. And as to the film's explanation about the emergence of UK's dark totalitarian society, it is as credible as the big secret of the `Matrix.'<br /><br />`V for Vendetta' is absolutely a `love-or-hate' film. Its unmistakable message is represented by the words of `V,' but some of you may find it shallow, and say no one in the truly totalitarian society can act like `V'. It is a curious mixture of the childish (anti-)heroism of musketeer and the sinister image of terrorist. The film tries to mix them, but is not always successful. Still the film's stylish actions and images with unexpected humor are undeniable.</p></br><a href="../users/A10HMPPHWI3V0A.html">A10HMPPHWI3V0A</a><br/><p>I thought that this was a good little political thriller, it had some outstanding dialogue, exemplery effects & an overall pretty good little screenplay. Portman does a great job for such a vague charactor and "V" is a wonderful part as a whole, he truly represents a true, opinionated and couragous hero. I thought that it got stuck in the mud and began to get a little slow their in the middle but it sped up again in the end and overall it succeeded in being what slowly becomes a very unique "Marvel" film. Some of the parts of the film I thought were very clever such a the speech that "V" makes @ the beginning of the movie in  which he speaks in words that all start with the letter "V". Some other people say that you should read the comic book (I believe it is), before watching the movie so that you have a full understanding about what is going on and that way you can enjoy the "Deeper Meaning" as well, ...

However, there are some real groaners. The movie makes one think about the role of government and the abuse of power. These are good ideas to ponder. The theme of ideas gives to one of the worse groaners. It went something like "Behind this mask is an idea and ideas are bulletproof." The other bad line if you stop and think about it is "It is the government that should be afraid of the people." What does that really mean? Respect the people, maybe. A government that fears the people gives rise to dictatorships and genocide.<br /><br />The movie has some intelligence in the dialog and the plot, but it gives not even a hint toward the answers. The philosopy is inane. Chaos for chaos sake seems to be the message. There are some nice plot twists, but one really big one that does not seem plausible at all.<br /><br />The movie is visually stunning, the mask is really cool.

After seeing his From Hell, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and now this made into films, it's of little wonder why he wants nothing to do with the movie industry.  That aside, the film version of V For Vendetta isn't all bad, and it has some great moments and echos the atmosphere of the comic, but the changes made by the Wachowski Brothers downplays the morality tale that Moore so brilliantly weaved in the 80's when he foresaw a bleak and totalitarian future; one of which is becoming more and more frighteningly real by the day.  Natalie Portman is a combination of worthy and wooden in the role of Evey Hammond, a would be everyman who gets involved with a Guy Fawkes-mask wearing terrorist named V (Hugo Weaving, surprisingly perfectly cast) who plans to strike back against the oppressive British rule.  The sets, design (V's outfit has been wonderfully re-created) and action scenes are all well done, mainly by most of the crew members who worked on the Matrix films, and James McTeigue makes a solid debut as a director; but Moore's message gets lost in all the glossy action.  John Hurt is here as Sutler, the maniacal zealot Chancellor, and while it's good to see both Stephen Rea and Stephen Fry in big roles in a big picture, particularly Rea as the disenchanted inspector who has been assigned to the case.  All in all, Alan Moore's comic may be much more worthy of your time, but the film adaptation of V For Vendetta isn't all bad, which in itself is quite a surprise when you think about who all was behind it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GQKB1KF0CRPE.html">A3GQKB1KF0CRPE</a><br/><p>Admittedly, I don't go to the theatre much these days with all my deadlines, but I still know what is dead-bang good (for me, at least! lol).  I have not been impressed with this endless stream of regurgitated remakes this past year.  It's like Hollywood has gone brain dead.  Worse, these remakes are sooooooooo weak.  So when a movie moves me, spellbinds me, leaves me breathless, I am so thrilled to find it.  This movie has the pinch of 1984 (odd, since John Hurt was in that film, too), Zorro, Phantom of the Opera...heck, even the "V" is so much like the telly series V!!!  With a film striking so many "chords" within us, it's bound to find an audience, but is it original?  Damn straight it is!<br /><br />This movie, obviously, done in the UK, gives visions of grace and beauty, of the every man wanting a voice, wanting justice, wanting to believe.  It gives you humanity; it gives you romance.  The writing is fast paced, inventive so what was old is new again.  And Hugo Weaving is THE actor for the role of V.<br /><br />Remember, remember the fifth of November...a haunting film that stays with you.  Yes, you will remember, remember!!</p></br><a href="../users/ABFOAYZA2UHD3.html">ABFOAYZA2UHD3</a><br/><p>Natelie Portman overacting, as usual (her diapason of facial and body expressions is staggeringly narrow and more than wanting) but the script, photography, effects and the rest of the cast are excellent. Highly recommended, just like the comic book.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>We saw this movie on the IMAX screen here in San Francisco and it was fairly overpowering.  At the end of the movie we just sat there in our chairs while the Rolling Stones' "Street Fighting Man" blared out of the 108+ speakers hidden behind the screen, too drained to say anything but eager to agree.<br /><br />Natalie Portman is OK, her disturbing and irrelevant resemblance to Sinead O'Connor made us wonder why they just didn't go whole hog and put O'Connor in the movie.  She's not the world's most interesting actress but she seemed to be giving it her all, so we wound up liking her even at the same time as we were thinking how  tiny she is, like a little elf.  And the torture scenes seemed so unrealistic, like wouldn't a sneeze blow her against the prison cell wall and splat her like a flyswatter?  No way could she withstand the abuse she's dealt out in this movie.  I thought she had it bad in GARDEN STATE being forced into kookiness the whole time but here she has to represent the entire viewership of the movie as she (and by extension, ourselves) are argued and browbeaten into radical politics, possibly anarchy, by a well-written screenplay and a series of haunting, scary images on the screen.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving fares better, even with his painted on china (or is it bulletproof steel) mask and its great painted grin, like a merry-go-round horse grinning in a death rictus.  I thought it strange that he would choose as his theme song "Cry Me a River," but the other song he plays, by Antony and the Johnsons, really hit the note of the sexually "other."  When V falls in love with Evey, it really does change his plans as well as his perspective on the ultimate meaning of life and death.  As a love story, V FOR VENDETTA is a little bit similar to MY FAIR LADY.<br /><br />Is there some special pleading in the movie for gay and lesbian civil rights?  I don't see how you can read the subplots of Gordon Dietrich and of Valerie Page any other way.  My hat is off to a mainstream American movie that dares to raise these issues in the current climate of rightwing homophobia.<br /><br />Someone at the theater said the filmmakers had originally cast James Purefoy, whom I remember as the faun in NARNIA, to play V, then after a few scenes realized he wasn't working out, similarly to the way Viggo Mortensen wound up replacing Stuart Townsend as Aragorn in THE LORD OF THE RINGS.  I watched the movie and I concur with the filmmaker's decision.  I just can't imagine V played by anyone else but Weaving.  But this isn't really an actor's movie, is it?  (Although Stephen Rea does some magnificently simple yet enthralling work as Chief Inspector Finch, the policeman who gradually goes over to the "dark side.")  I was astounded by the way that, individual plots points and loose threads seem to disappear into outer space while leaving us with a modern fable of great power and communal beauty and fire.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>At long last, Alan Moore's tale of a post-nuclear England, a fascist government and the lone terrorist/freedom fighter who stood up to it comes to the screen.  It's felt like a long time, especially due to the pushed back release date, but it was certainly worth it.<br /><br />V For Vendetta is based upon the graphic novel written by Alan Moore, who is generally considered to be one of the greatest comics writers of all time.  Moore's stories are known for their political intrigue and amazing ability to look at real-life situations in ways very few other forms of entertainment in any media can.  While the story has changed a little from the 1982 book, the 2006 film still captures the message perfectly.<br /><br />Set in London, England in the near future, it turns out things have gone very wrong in the world.  Due to the military advances of the United States, the world has suffered through a terrible nuclear war.  England is one of the few countries to survive, which is lucky for them, seeing as how they were allies of the US and aided in their military campaign.  For years, there was chaos and panic due to the lack of resources, and things didn't calm down until a new political party was able to come to power.  Led by Adam Sutler (John Hurt), the party promised peace and tranquility.  Unfortunately, in return for peace, the citiznes of England gave up their rights.  Quarantine zones were set up, curfews were enacted, and non-whites, gays, and non-Christians (anyone different) was deemed dangerous, rounded up, and taken away.  Furthermore, free speech, which includes political activism and speaking out against the government, was outlawed.  A secret police force was also set up.<br /><br />One evening, a young woman named Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) left her home after curfew and was assaulted by the secret police.  They planned on raping her, but a masked vigilante known only as V (Hugo Weaving) came to her rescue.  Wearing a Guy Fawkes mask and black leather garments, V effortlessly took out the trio of cops using only knives and his knowledge of the martial arts.  It turns out that V is somewhat of a Batman-type character in the sense that he can effectively use simple weapons, karate, and manipulation of his surroundings to take out his enemies, but he has a definite political agenda.  V is tired of the fascism and means to bring about a better type of goverment.  Using extensive knowledge of the government's inner workings, explosives, and computer hacking skills, V is able to blow up the Old Bailey as well as hack into the media networks.<br /><br />As the story progresses, we slowly learn V's motivations for why he is doing what he is doing, while Chief Inspector Finch (Stephen Rea), a respected party member, begins an investigation of his own as to who V is and what his motives are.<br /><br />It is interesting that, in today's world when the term terrorist is synonymous with evil, a movie whose "protagonist" is a terrorist would even be made.  However, one has to keep in mind that one man's terrorist is the freedom fighter of someone else (George Washington was most likely seen as a terrorist in the eyes of the British).  Still, V's tactics are brutal, and he is definitely not a hero.  The question that one must ask is how far one must go in pursuit of libery and justice.<br /><br />While there are a few things from the book that didn't make it into the film and there were a few story changes, the film more or less captures Moore's vision (though in the book, V explicitly states that he sought anarchy, while that isn't quite clear in the film).  The politics of this film may seem offensive to people at the extreme sides of the spectrum, but overall, it should intrigue most people.  And for the less politically-minded, it is also a great action film.  Verdict: go see V!</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I've never read the graphic novel, but I don't think you need to read it to appreciate the movie. There are some that will, upon seeing this film, say that it was akin to Andrew Lloyd Weber attempting to make a political statement: overly dramatic. These people would be well served to remember that the symbol of drama is a mask, which certainly begs one important question- Why, if you are so put off by an overtly dramatic motion picture, would you choose to see a movie that stars as the (anti)hero a man in a mask?<br /><br />This film doesn't glorify V as a terrorist but shows that under certain circumstances he was tempted to be what he is. The film has an intriguing atmosphere throughout, a few slow moments, and an apocalyptic future setting that really heightens the tension with starkly dark set design and stunning cinematography. There is a reference or close resemblance to Guatanamo prison in the film. And it made the film even more direct.<br /><br />Hidden behind the creepy mask, Hugo Weaving really proves he is a versatile actor. His character provokes thoughtful questions in a dystrophic future, and every emotion of his character is brought out by Weavings performance. Portman on the other hand also excels, with a convincing accent. She really is the heroine of the film and she handles the role quite well. The scenes between Evey and V are touching and well handled. The rest of the film is great in its execution. The climax, especially, was uplifting and will live on to be the most memorable conclusion. The action is striking and the performances in the drama are standout.<br /><br />I'm going to say that it's nothing short of its brilliance. Entertaining from the start, V manages to combine a strong socio-political message in a compact and highly intense experience. Infused with issues and concepts that pervade in the global political climate of our times, this movie is endowed with a tremendous timely relevance that belies its trappings as a mere action adventure. A terrific achievement produced by the Wachowski's and Silver.</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>V for Vendetta is the film you want to see with friends BEFORE dinner so that you can discuss it DURING dinner.  Wow.<br /><br />From the movie's web site, I found out that many of V's ( the main character) lines are not "original," but come from quotes of other, real,  famous (and infamous) leaders.<br /><br />The action starts quickly, but the story builds slowly. To the end, you are still waiting for answers.  Thank goodness the director and writers leave some unanswered... this is a powerful technique.<br /><br />There's even more.  Media manipulation by government.  The People's revolt.  The importance of youth in shaping the future.  Experiments on people.  Why good cops are essential in society.  There is a segment dealing with homosexuality and a horrible, draconian government approach to it (Nazi Germany is the obvious reference here).  It will be interesting to see how critics relate this part of the film to the "controversy" over Brokeback Mountain.<br /><br />I tell you, this is a heck of a film.  And did I mention the action?  Oh, and the hints about the Matrix connection.  This was NOT a "Matrix clone" at all.<br /><br />Should have been rated PG-13 instead of R.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UBVJEV1LLS7.html">A38UBVJEV1LLS7</a><br/><p>Poor Alan Moore has been a tortured man for some time. Two of his graphic novels have been turned into what can only be called - crap. However, V for Vendetta does not suffer such a fate. There are some discrepancies, of course, but the film as a whole is highly successful and very entertaining.<br /><br />V for Vendetta is very well cast with loveable and hateable foils that make the film easy to follow. Portman is a joy as usual (not always). She is more than sufficient and brings much to her role as Evey. I was disappointed that they changed her profession (readers will catch my drift). However, the heart of her character is the same, and Portman does her finest, most touching work since Closer. V is well cast as well. I actually like the voice of Weaving coming from beneath that mocking mask, and his chemistry with Portman is remarkable considering that they are never actually face-to-face.<br /><br />The political aims (Bush etc.) in the film are fairly open, and can sometimes be distracting. However, as a whole the film is true to spirit of the novel. The air of revolution is thick with ideals and freedom, and one can actually see the people coming to life. I also think that the ending scenes are beautifully handled as the country transforms from a society of drones to one of individuals. I think that most anybody can enjoy this movie, if only for its incredible action and surprising sensitivity. Remember, remember this film forever.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3F04ZK7FG66.html">A2E3F04ZK7FG66</a><br/><p>I wouldn't say this is a great movie, but at least it took some chances. The idea of a terrorist as a popular hero, the irony of John Hurt who played Winston in "1984" playing the dictator, and the further irony of Stephen Rea who played a terrorist in "The Crying Game" playing the relentless cop who is now hunting a terrorist for the totalitarian regime were all braver ideas than I am accustomed to seeing coming out of Hollywood these days. However, it does seem obvious that the movie is taking swipes at the Bush administration and its supporters, which is not exactly a brave or bold position in Hollywood, or anywhere else for that matter.<br /><br />The acting is commendable. It is good to see Natalie Portman given the chance to take on a more challenging role than she was given in her part in the Star Wars prequels where, along with the rest of the cast, she saw lots of action but had little opportunity to act. Plus, Hugo Weaving had a real challenge to project a personality behind the Halloween mask he wore throughout the film with mere body language and the inflection of his voice. I think it was a challenge that he met admirably.<br /><br />I guess the one thing that really bothered me was the basic premise of the film. Having just read "While Europe Slept" I find it difficult to believe that the United States would end up self destructing by ever managing to be more politically correct than any country in Europe, including Great Britain. I also find it hard to believe that religious fundamentalism would ever take root in England, since its language and ways would seem foreign to almost the entire citizenry. After all, the entire continent of Europe has been in a post-Christian era for about the last one hundred years. Nobody in Europe would even understand what the dictator was talking about when he delivered one of his religious rants - he might as well be reciting Shakespeare backwards.<br /><br />However, if you can suspend your beliefs as to what is the most likely future of particular western countries, this is a pretty good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: The story of V, the masked freedom fighter (or terrorist), is a dark vision of the future and how the government basically runs our lives. We have seen a recent lineup of films that take on this 1984 theme of Big Brother and we must overthrow it. If you remember the slightly enjoyable Equilibrium, and the recent Aeon Flux and Ultraviolet then you can see that this has been expressed in film already. However, with the Wachowskis helming the script we finally have a real intellectual look at the subject of a totalitarian government. The film takes place in Britain and is ruled by a dictator who is played by John Hurt (you know him as the guy from Alien who had his chest bursted open). V is the man who was betrayed and left for dead by the government and almost lost his life in a fire. Now he stands against his nation's leader by destroying government buildings and rounding up society to stand with him. He covers up his scarred body with a black caped outfit and a vaudevillian mask. Natalie Portman plays the supporting role who ends up seeing the world has V sees it. The film is very stylish and the dialogue is rich with meaning. I haven't read the graphic novel, so I cannot say if this interpretation is faithful the the comic character. But it's hard to find whose vision is being represented in the film, and that kind of makes the film a little unfocused at times. You have the original source material by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, the screenplay by the Wachowski's, and first time director James McTeigue. McTeigue was First Assistant Director on all three Matrix films, so it looks as if he is just being largely influenced by the Wachowski's. It basically feels like there are 5 directors, and not one straight vision. Hugo Weaving seals the movie with his sophisticated voice and really gives the character a reason for his motivation. It's an overall entertaining film with lots of ideas being expressed. The only thing is that these ideas have been expressed many times already in a variety of similar films.<br /><br />ACTING: Hugo Weaving (known as Agent Smith in the Matrix films) plays V, and he does a fantastic job even though we never see his face. He expresses his character's emotion through voice, and his voice is a perfect fit for the character. Natalie Portman basically becomes V's back support, and becomes more attracted to him and his goals throughout the film. She goes through a rebirth and sees the government the way V does, and basically fights alongside him. I have to mention though that her British accent was quite weak. John Hurt does a satisfactory job as the angry dictator. The cast does a fine job, but no standout performances.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: How does one man secretly manufacture and ship vaudevillian masks, black capes, and black hats to the entire population of England while the country is under a dicatorship and everything is run by the government? I don't know, but if you can get past some illogical plot holes and a familiar plot; the film itself is entertaining and enjoyable. It's well done, but it has inconsistant direction. There are more pros than cons about the film, and it's worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>First of all, This movie was better than I thought it was gonna be. It's about governmental and political dictatorship. It shows how a government based on greed oppresses it's people by means of prejudice, invoking fear, censorship, and curfews. It gives you a look at how the media misinforms and misleads the people intentionally with false information. This movie is about a country needing one fearless leader, icon, or symbol willing to stand up and speak against these injustices. They get it in the form of a masked individual known simply as "V". "V" is all about starting a revolution to overthrow the government, so the people can take back their country and freedom without fear or reservations. Personally, I don't think this movie is pro-Bush or anti-Bush, but I do think it's left up to you to make the call, or interpret it as you will. All I know is, as far as entertainment value goes it was great. Natalie Portman was wonderful, and she still looked beautiful without hair. This movie gets..THUMBS UP!</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>Reading "V for Vendetta" (the graphic novel) was such an overwhelming experience that one could be forgiven for wishing fervently that a movie adaptation *not* be made. But the Wachowski Brothers have done a fantastic job of bringing the story to cinema.<br /><br />The story's main elements are here. Britain is a police state controlled by a fanatical and puritanical elite. The media is nothing but the propaganda arm of the government. And it is a government with much to hide. Into this repressive atmosphere comes "V," a terrorist bomber who wears a Guy Fawkes mask, black cape, broad brimmed hat, leggings and gloves, who spouts Shakespeare while staging elaborate explosions. The government needs to track him down before another "November, November, the fifth of the November" arrives, with more detonations and (more important) the possible toppling of their rule.<br /><br />Lovers of the graphic novel will recognize most of the main plot elements, which shall not be detailed here but which involve nazi-like concentration camps, medical experiments on humans and an attempt to suppress all but the most banal art and literature. A few plot and character changes tweaks don't disrupt the overall flow of the film. Evey, V's young protege, played with great expressiveness by Natalie Portman, is much smarter and more self-aware than in the novel. The number of government characters and spurned lovers, so hard to keep track of in the novel, have been pared down and made more recognizable.<br /><br />Most importantly, many of the novel's messages and insights have been retained -- the population pacified with a constant stream of TV amusements; the fear based on lies; the deep-seated need for freedom, the love of beauty, whether literary, religious or musical or visual. The parallels to the present are intentional. The only thing of any consequence that was missing (as far as I could tell) was the name of Alan Moore, who wrote the novel. "V" purists will no doubt dislike the ending, where most of the film's changes occur. Because of the paring down of extraneous characters, necessary actions have been shifted to other characters. Most of these shifts become apparent in the last 1/2 hour of the film. I'm no purist, and I thought this worked well.<br /><br />"V for Vendetta" is well worth the watch -- it is finely-crafted, well-written and superbly acted. Hugo Weaving (Elrond in Lord of the Rings) as "V" never showed his faced, but conveyed a broad range of emotions. His voice, soft and lyrical, yet capable of conveying menace, was perfect. And Stephen Rea, as the conflicted Inspector Finch, gave a restrained and effective performance.<br /><br />The DVD extra were mainly limited to a short "making of" feature that included so-so interviews with the actors and a few behind he scenes shots showing wire work and rehearsals. Nothing earth-shattering. While not completely conveying the darkness, sense of dread of the book on which it was based, nor its complexity, nor the mad lust for vengeance that propelled V on his murderous rampage, "V for Vendetta" was about as perfect an adaptation as could be hoped for. Readers of the novel should see the movie, and movie viewers should read the novel to get the full effect of this marvelous ode against the excesses of authoritarians and the fear that puts them, and keeps them, in power.</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>Alan Moore's decision to want his name off the final credits for the film adaptation of V for Vendetta now makes sense. Moore has had a hate/hate relationship with Hollywood and the film industry in general. They've taken two of his other works in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and From Hell and bollocks'd them up (to borrow a term used quite abit in V for Vendetta). Outside of Watchmen, Alan Moore sees V for Vendetta as one of his more personal works and after reading the screenplay adaptation of the graphic novel by The Wachowski Brothers his decision afterwards was to demand his name be removed from the film if it was ever made. Part of this was his hatred of the film industry for their past mistakes and another being his wish for a perfect adaptation or none at all. Well, V for Vendetta by James McTeigue and The Wachowski Brothers is not a perfect film adaptation. What it turns out to be is a film that stays true to the spirit of Moore's graphic novel and given a modern, up-to-the-current news retelling of the world's state of affairs.<br /><br />V for Vendetta starts off with abit of a prologue to explain the relevance of the Guy Fawkes mask worn by V throughout the film and the significance of the date of the 5th of November. I think this change in the story from the source material may be for the benefit of audiences who didn't grow up in the UK and have no idea of who Guy Fawkes was and what his Gunpowder Plot was all about. The sequence is short but informative. From then on we move on to the start of the main story and here the film adheres close enough to the source material with a few changes to the Evey character (played with skill that more than makes up for her Amidala performances) but not enough to ruin the character. Caught after curfew and accosted by the ruling government's secret police called Fingermen, Evey soon encounters V who saves her not just from imprisonment but rape.<br /><br />Right from the start the one thing McTeigue and The Wachowski Brothers got dead-on was casting Hugo Weaving as the title character. Voice silky, velvety and sonorous, Weaving infuses V with an otherworldly, theatrical personality. Whether V was speaking phrases from Shakespeare, philosophers or pop culture icons, the voice gave a character who doesn't show his face from behind the enternally-smiling Guy Fawkes mask real life. I'd forgiven the makers of this films for some of the changes they made to the story and some of the characters for keeping V as close to how Moore wrote him. Once V and Evey are thrown in together by the happenstance of that nightly encounter their fates became intertwined. Portman plays the reluctant witness to V's acts of terrorism, murders and destruction in the beginning, but a poignant and emotionally powerful sequence to start the second half of the film soon brings Evey's character not much towards V's way of doing things, but to understanding just why he's doing them. This sequence became the emotional punch of the whole film and is literally lifted word for word from the graphic novel. I heard more than just a few people sobbing in the theater as the scenes and story unfolded.<br /><br />The rest of the cast seemed like a who's who of the British acting community. From Stephen Rea's stubborn and dogged Chief Inspector Finch whose quest to find V leads him to finding clues about his government's past actions that he'd rather have not found. Then there's Stephen Fry's flamboyant TV show host who becomes Evey's only other ally whose secret longings have been forbidden by the government, but who's awakened by V's actions to go through with his own form of rebellion. Then there's John Hurt as High Chancellor Adam Sutler who's seen chewing up the scenery with his Hitler-like performance through Big Brother video conferences (an ironic bit of casting since John Hurt also played Winston Smith in the film adaptation of the Orwell classic 1984). I really couldn't find any of the supporting players as having done a bad job in their performances. Even Hurt's Sutler may seemed over-the-top to some but his performance just showed how much of a hatemonger Sutler and in the end his Norsefire party really were in order to stay in power.<br /><br />The story itself, as I mentioned earlier, had had some changes made to it. Some of these changes angered Moore and probably anger his more die-hard fans. I count myself as one of these die-hards, but I know how film adaptations of classic literary works must and need to trim some of the fat from the main body and theme of the story to fully translate onto the silver screen. The Wachowski Brother's screenplay did just that. They trimmed some of the side stories and tertiary characters from the story and concentrated on V, Evey and Inspector Finch's pursuit of both and the truth. This adaptation is much closer to how Peter Jackson adapted The Lord of the Rings. As a fan of Moore I understood why he was unhappy with the changes. But then Moore is also an avowed perfectionist and only a perfect adaptation would do.<br /><br />Already critics on both sides of the aisle have called V for Vendetta revolutionary, subversive, daring to irresponsible, propagandist. All because the film dares to ask serious questions about the nature and role of violence as a form of dissent. But the granddaddy question the film brings up that has people talking is the question: terrorist or freedom fighter? Is V one or the other or is he both? Make no mistake about it, V for all intents and purposes is a terrorist if one was to use the definition of what a terrorist is. The makers of this film goes to great lenghts to describe throughout the film just how Sutler and his Norsefire (with its iconic Nazi-like symbols and fundamentaist Christian thinking) party rose to power in the UK. Partly due to what seemed like the failed US foreign policy and its subsequent and destructive decline as a superpower and the worldwide panic and fear it began as a result. V for Vendetta also ask just who was to blame for allowing such individuals to rule over them. V has his reasons for killing these powers-that-be, but he also points out that people really should just look in the mirror if they need to know who really was to blame. For it was the population --- whose desire to remain safe and have a semblance of peace --- gave up more and more of their basic liberties and rights for a return to order. If one was to look at the past 100 years they would see that it's happened before. There was the regime of Pol Pot in Cambodia, Milosevic's Greater Serbia, and the king of the hill of them all being Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Inner Circle.<br /><br />Another thing about V for Vendetta that will surely talked about alot will be the images used in the film. Not just images and symbols looking so much like Nazi icons, but images from the current events sweeping the globe that has been shown time and time again in the news and written about in magazines and newspapers. The film shows people bound and hooded like prisoners from Abu Ghraib. The reason of the war on terror used time and time again by Sutler to justify why England and its people need him and his group to protect them by any means necessary. V for Vendetta seems like a timely film for our current times. Even with the conclusion of the film finally accomplishing what Guy Fawkes failed to do that night of November 5th some 400 plus years ago, V for Vendetta doesn't give all the answers to all the questions it raises. For some I'm sure this would be something that'll frustrate them. So much of people who go to watch thought-provoking films want their questions answered as clearly as possible and all of them. V for Vendetta doesn't answer them but gives the audience enough information to try and work it out themselves.<br /><br />In final analysis, V for Vendetta accomplishes in bringing the main themes of Alan Moore's graphic novel to life and even does it well despite some of the changes made. It is a film that is sure to polarize the extreme left and right of the political pundits and commentators. But as a piece of thought-provoking and even as a politically subversive film, V for Vendetta does it job well. It is not a perfect film by any respect, but the story and message it tries to convey in addition to its value as a piece of entertainment mor than makes up for its flaws. V for Vendetta more than continues the current crop of seriously done comic book fillm adaptations (Batman Begins, X2, Sin City, and A History of Violence) but it also shows that Alan Moore's work can be adapted well to the screen when given to the right people. It may not be perfect and it may not make Alan Moore happy, but it comes close and more than makes up for LXG and From Hell.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>I liked this movie. I wanted to see it on a big screen, maybe Imax, but waited too long. It was playing at the dollar movies, but I don't like going there, people have crying babies and make so much noise they spoil it. When it came out on DVD I went to the DVD store a million times asking for it, but all the copies were checked out. Finally I saw it and it did live up to and exceeded my expectations. It was awesome.<br /><br />Natalie Portman was great (do you suppose that's where Britney got the idea to shave her head?), and Hugo Weaving really conveyed a lot of emotion, even though he wore a mask throughout the entire film. It was cool when he was listening to Getz/Gilberto The Girl From Ipanema while scrambling eggs for Natalie in his Bachelor Pad/Bunker.<br /><br />I heard that the author of the graphic novel upon which it was based disowned the project, but like Bladerunner, it might have been a different story than what the author had in mind, but was a compelling cinematic vision in its own right.<br /><br />This movie worked as an action thriller, with just the right dose of irony, and then on another level altogher, it was a thought provoking film about politics, freedom, and the lack thereof.</p></br><a href="../users/A106016KSI0YQ.html">A106016KSI0YQ</a><br/><p>The best things in this literate Wachowski brothers' adaptation of the classic Moore/Lloyd graphic novel are its stars, Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman. They bring a depth to the material through their acting that would otherwise be very much lacking. Portman's finely felt work here as the heroine Evey is a revelation, given her woodenness in the recent Star Wars trilogy, but the real acting honors must go to Weaving, who wears a plastic Guy Fawkes mask thoughout the entire film in his role as the dashing Shakespeare-quoting freedom fighter (or terrorist, depending on your perspective): all his acting has to be done without the benefit of facial expression, and damned if Weaving doesn't make an actor's showcase of of the part nonetheless and invest it with multiple dimensions.<br /><br />The concept of both the film and the graphic novel involves the political resistance of a masked swashbuckler in a totalitarian Britain of the very near future: its resonances in the wake of 9/11 and the Patriot Act are quite strong. The film's visuals are actually a bit heavyhanded: the evil High Chancellor (John Hurt, in an atypical scenery-chewing performance) communicates with his council of lackeys via closed-circuit TV in scenes reminiscent of the famous "1984" Apple Super Bowl commercial, while his rise to power is documented in clips that almost exactly evoke the Nuremberg rallies documented in "Triumph of the Will." The film's scenic designer seems to have felt his audience would be so dim that even THAT wouldn't be enough, and so the Chancellor's Norsefire Party uses as a color scheme black with red accents, as in a Satanic Black Mass. But the intelligence behind Alan moore's original conception for the work overrides this, and Weaving and Portman greatly redeem the material. This special 2-disc DVD features a short on the making of the film's visual look (the producers and director and scenic director seem intent on convincing us that what they've done with it really brilliant, which seems funny in a film all about propaganda), another on the original Moore/Lloyd graphic novel and the new wave of comics, and a third on the historical underpinnings of this film in the Gunpowder Plot and Guido "Guy" Fawkes.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>I was fortunate in that I brought no expectations to this film.  I didn't know it was from the "Matrix" crowd, a film I very much enjoyed.  If anything I thought it was one of those dumb Batman, Spiderman super-hero movies that offer light entertainment - the artistic equivalent of cotton candy.  What I found instead was that rarest of all creatures, a blockbuster film with wonderful production values that entertains and actually engages the mind by posing interesting and difficult questions.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving does more with his voice and movements than most actors do with their entire toolkit; he was perfectly cast as the man behind the mask.  Natalie Portman is excellent as the reluctant co-conspirator, drawn into V's world.  Stephen Rea is downright great as Chief Inspector Finch, our "everyman" figure who must sort through the rubble to dislodge truth.  John Hurt seems to be channeling William Smith from 1984, with a soupcon of Hitler, his frenzy and fury are thoroughly convincing.<br /><br />What makes the film so brave and unusual is that, in our nervous age, it actually casts a terrorist as hero.  This is heady stuff and reminds us that, "one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter."  V presents an interesting blend of instant karma, righteous vengeance, and social idealism.  Though his motives are personal, he does understand them in a larger context.  His handoff to Portman at the finish recalls the desire of Generals to create a world where their children can study philosophy.<br /><br />V is unlike many movies in that it has a superb 2nd act.  Portman's time in the faux prison, and the powerful epistolary relationship with the unseen individual one cell over, provide this film with a compelling underlying humanity.  Political references abound in V, as do film references, and they all serve to reinforce the core idea that governments really are created to serve people, not vice versa, and when that ceases to be the case, something must be done.  Perhaps the discomfort surrounding this film would be diminished if we all recalled that's precisely what our beloved founding fathers did.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>3.5 stars.  This is a descent movie, however, I think the concept and the story is better suited for graphic novel medium and doesn't translate as poignantly as a film.  Film, books and music are often warning us to mindful of our goverment and how easily we can slip into a totalitarian rule.  Fear is a very real weapon most goverments have already learned to weld to shrink civil rights in the name of national secruity.  Yet as a film, this one is missing some things.  I never truely contected with V.  There are a few scene when he comes off looking rather silly (cooking-kissing).  Weaving, likely a strong actor with a very theatrical voice, the mask was too cold a shield for an audience to connect to.  At the very least I would have liked to see his eyes.  Something for him to become more real to me.  Portman's character could have just as easily been taken out.  I know what she was suppose to symbolize, but, eh, I wanted her to be more involved in the revolution and I guess I wanted a bigger revolution than what was delivered on screen.  Again, it's a good film, just not a great one.</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>I am very overwhelmed and speechless after watching this movie. It takes every civil rights movement and rolls it all into one. This movie takes a very serious look at the way violence is portrayed in modern society and how it is reported to society as well. There are a few things that do stick out in my mind. One of them is "We should not be afraid of government, they should be afraid of us" and look at the last election what we did as a nation to change what is effecting us. Another thing that sticks out in my mind is history and the definition of "terrorists". Are the "terrorists" coming from an outside source? Or are they coming from within our own country? Are the "terrorists' acts" planned from our own country from people that we should trust? Or maybe we shouldn't have trusted them in the first place. If you look at history of the world from the witch hunts to Nazi Germany to modern day government, it is all "controlled and guided" by religious zealots trying to "save society" or "save the children". We should wake up as a "world" and save ourselves from them. I am with V in this one; everyone should have the ability to live in peace for whom and what they are. Not be controlled by government guided by religious zealots in how you should be or who you ought to be. Until then, there will be no peace. I highly recommend this movie to everyone!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>Great film. Impressive commentary. Stunning visuals.  Glimpse of the future, perhaps? Vivid slice of the present, without question.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>A science fiction film with a message. Who would've thought it possible. I don't mean this has never happened, it's just that it hasn't happened in quite some time. To put it in perspective, my favorite SF film was THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Although many people make that claim, here it is noteworthy because The Day The Earth Stood Still was a brave undertaking, commenting on the dangers of nuclear technology during a time when our government and our country felt this was a necessary evil. I'm not saying V FOR VENDETTA rates up on the same level, but it does have its moments, making us question the purpose of government and the repercussions of overstepping those purposes for its own "good" rather than the individuals it's supposed to serve.<br /><br />Coming from the Wachowski brothers who made THE MATRIX trilogy, V has a good cast realized via the comic book of the same name but takes a while to get on track. The first third of the film was pretty slow and involved, but the latter parts made up for this.<br /><br />The story is about a masked man named V (Hugo Weaving, THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy) who was a guinea pig for a pharmaceutical company. A group of men and women have hidden their involvement with this distasteful part of history as we lunge forward to the year 2020. A totalitarian government rules England, cowing its citizens by enforcing curfews, limiting religious freedoms, and eliminating homosexuality (if you're a gay Buddhist out after nine p.m. you're in BIG trouble!)<br /><br />Weaving a bit of history into the story, we see Guy Fawkes Day (November 5th) taken to a whole new level. V plans to destroy Parliament because of its wickedness and the fear under which English citizens now live. Not to mention that Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt, CONTACT) is one of the pharmaceutical founders that altered V's life forever; V has no recollection of his past, including his own name, and has an altered body chemistry allowing him superhuman agility thanks to the drugs that were tested on him. This is very bad news for those involved in screwing up his life. V is out for Vengeance, too.<br /><br />But V is also lonely, so when Evey (Natalie Portman, STAR WARS III) helps him make good an escape, he pulls her into his confidence, eventually forcing her to lose all her fears through a set of brutal tests. In Evey V sees the future of mankind, a sign that all may be made right with the world.<br /><br />In a stunning climax, we watch V's vision come to life, as fireworks blow, thousands turn out wearing Guy Fawkes/V masks, and Evey comes to understand how important change is in the world.<br /><br />This film certainly won't be for everyone. You have to think about what's happening to really understand the message. It doesn't smack you in the face with an obvious plot, and instead lets it seep into the viewer's subconscious.<br /><br />There are, as seen in other reviews, a lot of talk about what this film's intent was supposed to be, and I think that speaks pretty highly for the level of sophistication needed to help one grasp V. Is he a freedom fighter or a terrorist? Anyone who wants to destroy a government must be crazy and/or an anarchist, right? How far is too far when a government wants to "protect" its citizens? These are questions the movie poses but doesn't give answers to, and that is quite refreshing considering what Hollywood usually places in front of us (A + B = C). Connect your own dots and see where V leads you.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>Well, if you like your villain as some sort of Wizard of Oz - Big Brother Stalinist Nazi - Ranting Phoole with a ham handed George W. Bush smear and your hero as a self-justified terrorist who believes that destroying symbolic infrastructure will somehow revive a moribund culture and that swords are more effective than guns, well, this movie might be for you.<br /><br />I watched the movie because I am a fan of Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving (and I didn't think it was possible that the brothers who made the first Matrix could make a worse movie than Matrix 3, but I was wrong).  Portman and Weaving both do the best they can with the handicaps they are given (such as an idiotic plot and pretty weak dialogue), but ultimately their talents are wasted.<br /><br />John Hurt is a terrific actor who is given the role of the big villain.  The movie completely misunderstands how terror leaders hold power.  It thinks that they yell and scream and threaten and kill everyone indiscriminately.  Really, they have to combine murder with a kind of charisma and off-balancing kindness to keep at least some key people on their side.  Anyway, Hurt is certainly what the script asks him to be, but the character is a waste of his abilities.<br /><br />Weaving only gets to use his voice and I am not sure he was ever the body wearing the mask.  If he was, why?  He is not needed under the mask anymore than James Earl Jones had to wear the Darth Vader costume to create such a memorable character.  There is one scene that is certainly was him, but that is beside the point.  He does a fine job making the character with his voice, but the character of V, from what the movie reveals as his origins, is beyond implausible.<br /><br />The best role in the movie probably goes to Stephen Rea as Inspector Finch (he was also very good as the lead in Citizen X as the detective Lt. Bukarov).  He has that dogged presence that just keeps after the truth no matter where it leads and despite all impediments put in his way.  However, here it is not possible that someone as intelligent as Finch would be so clueless about the truth behind the regime.<br /><br />The Wachowski brothers have traded on a cheap kind of paranoia that resonates with their audience, but this one is incredibly dumb.  If you actually believe that political leaders can make reality out of media messages despite what is actually happening in the real world, well, this movie will seem like a documentary, I guess.  But I would then feel sorry for you and encourage you to get some help.  Each movie these brothers have made since the first Matrix has gotten weaker and more pathetic.  Maybe it is time to turn off their money spigot.  Of course that won't happen because they turned $50 million into $130 million at the box office plus all the DVD sales and rentals to people like me.<br /><br />Oh, well.</p></br><a href="../users/ALWB64XOXNMDP.html">ALWB64XOXNMDP</a><br/><p>I have to agree with a lot of what has been said about the film. The film left me wanting to know more about the man.  Being disfigured beneath the mask; I still wanted to see the face of the man.  What type of life did he lead before this?  What was his job? What made him want to act? These are all unanswered questions that make the movie less.  I didn't read the graphic novel.  I intend to if it answers any questions the film didn't.<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen the Wachovski's first pass at the script.  It might have provided more answers than this final version.  It was a great film but I have to wonder if any of the best parts were left on the cutting room floor.....</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>In the England of 2020, dictator Adam Sutler (Hurt) rules with an iron fist.  Citizens live in fear of him and his regime.  One man who stands against him in a mysterious figure that goes by the name "V" (Weaving).  Hidden behind a Guy Fawkes mask, he seeks to inspire the people.  Evey (Portman) is saved by V one night when she is backed into a corner by Sutler's men.  Then he invites her to a viewing of a "performance" that he has arranged...the blowing up of the Old Bailey.  He gives the government one year before he goes after parliament, and asks the citizens to stand up with him.<br /><br />"V for Vendetta" is an interesting enough movie that is an attempt to not so subtly mirror current events.  This is somewhat of a mistake, as it will alienate some of the audience.  Also, the hero is a terrorist, who resorts to torture of an innocent to further his goals.  Weaving does a good job as V, especially since you do not see his face throughout the entire movie.  Portman does a passable job as Evie, but is nothing spectacular.  "V" will give the viewer something to think about, and is not your standard comic book movie.  This is definately one of the better movies to come out so far this year though, and that may be reason enough to see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PIX2K56IZZYX.html">A2PIX2K56IZZYX</a><br/><p>Acting--------------------9 out of 10, Weaving and Portman are incredible, Rea and Hurt not to far behind<br /><br />Directing-----------------9 out of 10<br /><br />Location/Scenery---------10 out of 10, Visually stunning!!<br /><br />Action/Drama rating-------9 out of 10, Perfect mix of many themes<br /><br />Quality------------------10 out of 10, Nearly flawless<br /><br />Total Score-------------47 out of 50, A<br /><br />Violence------------High, Amazing knife battles, perfectly choreographed, high gun play<br /><br />Blood/Gore----------Medium to High, Gets pretty graphic toward the end, somewhat mild until then<br /><br />Nudity--------------Very little, Dead bodies and Portman in skimpy outfits<br /><br />Sex-----------------None<br /><br />Language------------Medium, Couple of F-bombs, and many, many bollocks<br /><br />Overall-------------Teens 16 and over should be fine<br /><br />I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this, but I'll try.

Four centuries later, V made his appearance. This smart plot combined clever and timely the ancestral legend of the Phantom Opera, the famous Count of Monte Christ, and through a wise game of crossed words and an admirable use of the semiotic, produced an underworld hero, "V" . curiously V was the signal of victory used by Churchill, but besides it might be regarded vengeance, virus and violence, who emerges from the sashes and the forgetfulness, who makes a smart plan after a terrible disgrace on Queen Mary's Hospital, as consequence of a failed experiment.<br /><br />In this sense, one might affirm the urban legend follows the mythical traces where the bad guys belong to the highest sphere of the government, featured by a visible Nazi taste (once more the semiotic lexicon, the use of the flags, the huge manifestations of submission and febrile obedience before the shelter state, the figure of the First Chancellor, who never talks directly to his subordinates, with clear reminiscences of George Orwell's 1984's Big brother)<br /><br />The rest of the movie runs for you, marvellously edited, magisterially filmed and supported by a tense and unpredictable script will lead the spectator to a chilling and surprising climax, with the accords of 1812 Overture, another semiotic element of well known historical transcendence.<br /><br />Natalie Portman once more carves in relief her outstanding skills as character actress, Hugh Weaving as V gives a very convincing role and finally the emblematic John Hurt (who precisely was part of the cast of 1984) as the hated Chancellor conform a well-rounded film that will reward even the most exigent of the spectators.<br /><br />To my mind, this movie must be included among the most emblematic cult movies of this raising century.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>V FOR VENDETTA is a superbly orchestrated and well made movie, with evidence of its MATRIX lineage highly evident in the stylized feel of the movie.  Hugo Weaving does a remarkably good job considering we never see the actors face, so with his Guy Fawlkes mask always on, his character has to be accessed with his voice more than anything, and Weaving is amazing in conveying V's mission and feelings.  Natalie Portman is equally impressive as Evey, the girl he rescues from police and hides her away in his hideaway.  Their relationship develops interestingly and convincingly.  Stephen Rea as the determined Police Inspector does some of his best work since THE CRYING GAME, and John Hurt who plays the tyrannical Chancellor rises to the occasion.  The film's message is pertinent to a society where the government certainly squelches individualism and creativity, nnd the direction and camera work are brilliant.  It isn't a pleasant picture the movie paints, but it is certainly well done and worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCPMT1RRS7K0.html">A1VCPMT1RRS7K0</a><br/><p>This movie turned out to be FAR better than I was expecting.

He was perfect for the role and I don't believe that anyone in the business could have outdone him in this role.

Allow me first to apologize for this interruption. I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of the every day routine- the security of the familiar, the tranquility of repetition. I enjoy them as much as any bloke. But in the spirit of commemoration, whereby those important events of the past, usually associated with someone's death or the end of some awful, bloody struggle, are celebrated with a nice holiday, I thought we could mark this November the 5th, a day that is sadly no longer remembered, by taking some time out of our daily lives to sit down and have a little chat. There are of course those who do not want us to speak. I suspect even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will soon be on their way. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those who are more responsible than others and they will be held accountable but again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler. He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent. Last night I sought to end that silence. Last night I destroyed the Old Bailey to remind this country of what it has forgotten. More than four hundred years ago a great citizen wished to embed the fifth of November forever in our memory. His hope was to remind the world that fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words, they are perspectives. So if you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you then I would suggest that you allow the fifth of November to pass unmarked. But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek, then I ask you to stand beside me one year from tonight, outside the gates of Parliament, and together we shall give them a fifth of November that shall never, ever be forgot. "<br /><br />"V" is the symbol that everyone is waiting for. The man who makes right all the wrongs that have been done. He accomplishes this by violence as his vendetta, and that theme is where all goes wrong. Certainly, he accomplishes what he set out to do, but murder, violence are not what out country wants. We want peaceful solutions, although we have not found in our history that peace derives change. War and violence are usually needed to forgo change. The country cannot and will not accept that our Democratic principles will not allow it. "V" is our hero and is played brilliantly by Hugo Weaving. The heroine, Evey played by Natalie Portman is the victim and the unwanted heroine. She knows not what she is doing, but she understands it s a necessity.  The confusion that ensues in this movie is not hard to understand. A little bit of our history is needed to fully understand that HOPE is what is needed.<br /><br />"The two conflicting political viewpoints of anarchism and fascism permeate the story. The Norsefire regime shares every facet of fascist ideology: it rules by fear and authority and worships strong leadership (i.e. the f&uuml;hrerprinzip). However, the regime was put in place by democratic means, just like the regime in Nazi Germany. As in most fascist regimes, there are several different types of police and military police who engage in power struggles with each other yet obey the same leader." Wikipedia.<br /><br />Of note: "V for Vendetta deals with issues of race, sexuality, religion, totalitarianism, and terrorism. Its controversial storyline and themes have, inevitably, made it the target of both criticism and praise from different sociopolitical groups. Many libertarians, especially at the Mises Institute's LewRockwell.com see the film as a positive depiction in favor of a free society with limited government and free enterprise, citing the state's terrorism as being of greater evil and rationalized by its political machinery, while V's acts are seen as 'terrorist' because they are done by a single individual."<br /><br />The cast was well selected and superb.<br /><br />Stephen Rea ....

The secondary underlying message of the film is that we should be weary of those who have an anti-gay, anti-Islam agenda. Which religious group could they be referring to exactly? hmmmmmmm...</p></br><a href="../users/A3CIH3P8UDB6GR.html">A3CIH3P8UDB6GR</a><br/><p>First of all, I thought it was kind of cheesy and how it was just not much as what I expected.  I will say at the end with all the masks. "cool part!"  Although, i will buy it in HD DVD format but I think it's a movie that will grow on you if watched more than once. . . or twice. . . for that reason I just think that it felt like Zorro meets Revolutionist meets Batman Gotham City.  It had its moment but I thought the Natalie Portman character was kind of stupid, and I like Natalie. . . but oh well......  Should Rent it and atleast give this movie a try.  I'm buying it lol with just 3 stars but thats because i'm builting an HD DVD Collections and think this movie would look great!!! But if i hated the movie lol . . . forget HD lol rather buy Muppet Show HD DVD than this, but it wasn't BAD!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>After anticipating this movie for so long, all of a sudden I found myself not wanting to watch it. I couldn't figure it out: was it the negative press, or the controversy, or the fact that I read the original graphic novel and wasn't that big of a fan of it? I still can't figure it out after watching it actually. It's certainly an admirable film and one that's really easy to like but I found it hard to love.<br /><br />We're in an Orwellian "1984"-esque England where the government controls everything, microphones and cameras are everywhere, religious texts are banned and dissenters often disappear. Leading the fight for freedom is V, a man in a mask inspired by Guy Fawkes who dons knives and takes down key members of government and plans to blow up Parliament. With him is Evey, a young woman whose had more than her share of problems who can't figure out whether action does create results, even if said action involves killing and explosions.<br /><br />Remember how after 9/11, certain songs or movies were kind of banned for awhile? Then there was that Simpsons episode where Homer goes to the Towers looking for a washroom that got taken off the air? Well Vendetta certainly picked a worst(or better, depending on your viewpoint) time to come out since anything involving terrorism gets people up in arms. I find governments have the ability to go deaf at will, oblivious to people's cries for help until they decide action should be taken. Standing in front of a tree once a year and saying the environment is good does not make you an environmentalist. Well, blowing up Parliament or the White House certainly isn't a good idea to create change, it's sad that something of that magnitude in some form has to happen before people realize "hey, we ARE getting screwed here!"<br /><br />How is the film? Well, it's got problems really. It starts out fine but then it hits the hour mark and while it doesn't slam on the brakes, the gas is definately running out. I'm not an action junkie but I'd like something of substance to happen and unfortunately it just kind of goes. Acting-wise though the film is quite good with Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving, the latter being very charismatic even just through voice. But like in Lord of the Rings, I can't help but think he's gonna bust out a "Mr. Anderson..." at any moment.<br /><br />Extras-wise it's incredibly disappointing. There was more featurettes on my one disc Serenity then there was on this thing. Expect another release sometime in the future I bet. The film works at the same time for reasons it doesn't but despite the fact the Wachowski Brothers are all over this, it certainly makes up for the last 2 Matrix movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A19OQ7LWE2YJL3.html">A19OQ7LWE2YJL3</a><br/><p>A little slow and confusing in spots, and pretty hard to believe Portman as a lowly office clerk.  But a very interesting plot and premise. Good story about an idea and trying to make a difference.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Though the packaging of both the theatrical release and the DVD suggest that V FOR VENDETTA  is yet another action hero comic book foray, nothing could be further from fact.  James McTeigue has directed this Wachowski Brothers adaptation of Alan Moore's comic book into a story that is intelligent, frightening, spectacularly produced and acted and the result is a fable for our minds to consider.<br /><br />Swooping out of the time in England in 1605 for some background as to the mission of our hero, V (Hugo Weaving)  appears as a masked grinning man who uses terrorist tactics to take down a British government as corrupt as any one might imagine.  The time is 2020 and England rules in a totalitarian manner, its greatest enemy, the United States, has self destructed, and the government controls the lives and thoughts of the British citizenry.  One remnant of the government's destructive forces is a beautiful girl Evey (Natalie Portman) who rapidly becomes V's apprentice/accomplice in the fight against the corrupt powers. The police (Stephen Rea and Rupert Graves) work to capture V and Evey, thinking they are terrorists out to destroy the government.  But the heads of state (John Hurt et al) fanatically attempt to brainwash the populace through the television madness of a talk show host.  Gradually the horrors of the current regime are revealed and it is a case of the good guys versus the bad guys with Portman and Weaving towering in importance by the end of the film.  The quality of acting form this fine cast (including such actors as Stephen Fry among many others) is first class, making the potential silliness of the story dissolve into horror.<br /><br />Well crafted films such as this serve the public well: sometimes it takes a visual depiction of the 'comic book look' of government officials to make us more sensitized to the direction we could be taking. It is an entertaining, fine movie - but it is more importantly a red flag warning we should all be heeding!

War, disease, discrimination and violence are at an all time high, especially in the U.K., which is under the control of the sadistic Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt) and his secret police. Citizens of London have no basic freedoms. They are oppressed by their totalitarian government, almost brainwashed to a degree. Little do they know, one man is out to change all that.<br /><br />That man is a masked agent going by the name of V (played magnificently by Hugo Weaving). Inspired by the legendary Guy Fawkes, V is thought of a terrorist by many, as his tactics often involve endangering lives and going to great extremes to achieve liberation. When V saves the life of working class girl Evey Hammond (the always captivating Miss Natalie Portman), V offers her a chance to join him on his crusade for complete freedom. Evey, despite her odd attraction to this masked avenger with a great taste in the arts, is reluctant. She is not sure whether to view him as a hero or to share the viewpoint of those who view him as the villain. But when Evey realizes just how much the government has brought suffering to her fellow citizens (not to mention the memories of the loss of her family), Evey realizes V is the only symbol of freedom left in the world. She joins V, even after he manipulates, tricks and tortures her, because she knows no matter what, his methods are the last chance the world has got.<br /><br />Backed by an excellent supporting cast, "V For Vendetta" is not only one of the finest comic book movies ever made, but also scores actual merits as a movie in general. The storyline, the acting, the direction, and special effects are all top notch, and make "V For Vendetta" one of the first great cinematic triumphs of 21st century cinema.<br /><br />This two disc special edition is loaded with a stunning array of drool-worthy extras, including several documentaries as well as secret access to Natalie's uproarious gangsta-rap from "Saturday Night Live". All these as well as the masterpiece that is the film itself make "V For Vendetta" a must have for anybody's dvd collection.</p></br><a href="../users/AV1KYJXHOWPMD.html">AV1KYJXHOWPMD</a><br/><p>Very exciting movie.

Recomended.</p></br><a href="../users/AXQ8T2D9IT6UG.html">AXQ8T2D9IT6UG</a><br/><p>"V for Vendetta" is an interesting movie that won't allow you to remain indifferent. Love or hate it, I'm pretty sure that you will have an opinion about this polemic film, based on a comic written by Alan Moore, adapted to the big screen by the Wachowski Brothers, and directed by James McTeigue.<br /><br />The story begins in England, but not in the England we know. McTeigue's England is eerily similar to the country that Orwell's tells us about in "1984". There is a dictator, Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt), that was chosen in free elections, but that afterwards decided to become an absolute ruler, exerting power without any kind of restriction. The citizens do nothing, they have relinquished their right to participate and to decide, and are merely sheep being told what to do and what to think. Their freedom is curtailed, but they feel safe.<br /><br />However someone is prepared to shake their certitude, and make them realize that things are not what they seem to be. That person is V (Hugo Weaving), a man that is willing to risk everything in order to turn meek sheep into citizens, and to wreak havoc on the enemies that destroyed his life a long time ago. Evey (Natalie Portman), a young woman that V rescues from Sutler's minions, is a privileged spectator of V's plans, and the first person to become a fervent follower. That path, though, is not easy, as Evey's new strenght will be forged in the fires of prison.<br /><br />This is a highly controversial movie that delves upon difficult subjects, for example whether the end validates the means, and the power of words. All the same, "V for Vendetta" makes you think, has great actors, an original cinematography and a hectic pace. From my point of view, this film is simply a must see.<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></br><a href="../users/A2MQQI4UYT9C11.html">A2MQQI4UYT9C11</a><br/><p>Natalie Portman was the major reason for my interest in this one.  Otherwise, I'm not a big fan of comic book movies, and might never have seen a very provocative and well-made film.  The near-future British setting recalls "Clockwork Orange", as does the man-vs-state story, although Hugo Weaving's "V" is a more admirable protagonist than Malcolm McDowell's Alex.  "V"'s V-alliterative soliloquy near the beginning and the overall production design are highlights, as is the history lesson on Guy Fawkes Day.  Surprisingly, Portman gets outdone by mask-wearing Weaving, who has the perfect voice for such a mysterious and threatening part.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>While I didn't like this one as much as some recent graphic novel screenplays such as a History of Violence and Road to Perdition, it was a good try.  I found it to be a bit long, and I thought it could have been trimmed a tiny bit.  Though I know that Alan Moore fans are already angered by some of the side plots and character trimming that had already occured.  The movie involves a future Britain that has become a Nazi like totalitarian state.  There is no denying the jabs at the current American government.  I am not a big fan of making terrorism a heroic thing, so I wasn't crazy about V blowing up things.  It is an interesting movie and social commentary.  Fine acting, and a fair adaptation.  Worth a watch, but not quite a buy for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A1O60Q7LBN4MQ.html">A1O60Q7LBN4MQ</a><br/><p>A little 1984 (George Orwell) and the real politics of today (terrorism, possible germ warfare) with imagination what the future could hold. I was enthralled and I can't help but think if I was British I would appreciate this movie more.<br /><br />We must be vigilant and not allow the government to get away with anything. No matter what political affiliation you have, we must keep checks in place so nothing near this can happen.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>Here is a stunningly elegant movie that is sure to grasp your attention.  The "hero" is a dark vigilante type character who has been victimized by "the system."  He is out for revenge, and the powers-that-be in the upper echelons of government had better take heed!<br /><br />Natalie Portman is gorgeous.  Heck, she even looks great bald.  She also has a lot of potential as an actress.  She is perfect as the dark hero's side-kick.  Hugo Weaving is terrific as the vigilante.  He shows off the distinctive voice that we were introduced to in THE MATRIX series.<br /><br />On some level, this movie seems to be a subtle attack at the Bush administration and all of the steps it has taken to absorb more power and subtract any sort of congressional oversight.  Cutting away civil liberties in hopes of gaining more security is almost never a good idea. The totalitarian paradigm of "the ends justify the means of extreme government" is as alive and well today it has always been.  Just a thought.....<br /><br />In any case, this is a thrilling (albeit dark)  movie that is sure to be a worthwhile addition to your DVD collection.  When the leader of a country becomes the "bad guy" we're all in peril.  That is one lesson that will forever remain unchanging.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Despite some deficiencies in the plot, V for Vendetta makes for a fantastic, refreshingly different kind of motion picture.  The controversy surrounding the film was blown out of proportion, but it's easy to see why it could raise hackles in some quarters.  It's really the old terrorist vs. freedom fighter question which has taken on such an important place in modern society.  Despite a jab here or there at the United States, I don't think the film really makes any statement at all along today's geopolitical lines - due in no small part to the story's fantastical setting.  We all know never to say "it can't happen here," but I for one can certainly never foresee a blatantly fascist society with its very own Hitlerian demagogue emerging in, of all places, England.  Clearly, at least to me, the questions this film raises are quite abstract and not directly applicable to current events vis-&agrave;-vis the war on terror.  As an eye-opening reminder of the possibility of governmental abuse of power, however, the film's warning stands us all in good stead.<br /><br />The setting for this film is a futuristic England, wherein a fiery egomaniac and his cronies have usurped power and brought a hard iron fist down on the people.  Freedom of ideas and expression no longer exists; minority groups have been decimated by imprisonment, torture, and death; and militaristic nationalism has become the new religion.  Those who resisted the meteoric rise of the new High Chancellor have been dealt with ruthlessly, producing a population cowed and blind to the evils of their brave new nation-state.  The illusion of peace is broken by one man, however - one man brave enough to speak the truth, rally the masses, and get his message out that the government is beyond corrupt and purely evil.  V wears the mask of the infamous Guy Fawkes, but his message is more than symbolic.  For twenty years, he has worked for this moment in time, intent on meting out justice and vengeance on those who wronged him personally and the body politic as a whole.  His tactics are certainly questionable, but his motivations are unimpeachable.<br /><br />It's all too easy to get bogged down in the question as to V's nature - be it terrorist or freedom fighter.  Unfortunately, the question must be asked and has been asked by some who condemn the film for glorifying terrorism.  To my eyes, he's clearly a terrorist - and a freedom fighter.  One has to look at the whole picture, though.  Here, we can see that the government V seeks to destroy is unquestionably evil.  Does that make it okay for V to employ tactics of murder and widespread destruction?  That's for each viewer to decide.  It's difficult to judge a man who does the wrong things for the right reasons.  It's even harder to carry that sort of thinking further, but it's healthy for individuals to ponder such questions, especially as humanity has a long tradition of learning nothing from history.<br /><br />Back to the film itself, one must pay tribute to a number of wonderful performances.  Natalie Portman proves once again that she's among the finest actresses in the world (a fact which George Lucas never seemed to acknowledge, since he didn't allow her to actually act in Star Wars Episode III).  The character of Evey was quite a challenge, but Portman makes you doubt that any other actress could have played her.  Nothing says commitment like a beautiful woman allowing her head to be shaved for the benefit of the character.  Hugo Weaving is mysteriously majestic as the man behind the mask, giving unassailable substance to a character who could have easily come across as cartoonish.  Stephen Rea brings a wonderful human counterpart to the story as the Chief Inspector, and John Hurt is brilliantly effective as the evil Chancellor.  The overall cinematography is also spectacularly done, while the special effects are really something to see.  V for Vendetta really is just a few plot holes and inconsistencies away from being a certifiable five-star film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>Christain? Right wing, security overkill & paranoid. Braying jackasses in the media prattling on how wonderful you are. Sound like a government we know?<br />  It's facist Britain in 2020. The United States has fallen into civil war & no longer matters.<br />This seems to raise faintly disguised satisfaction in Britain. There is a terroist in London. He on the side of the people aiming to overthrow the oppressive government. For purpose of this movie, he is the good guy. He is pretty brutal & kills without hesitation, those that he deems, deserve it. He is inspired by Guy Fawkes. He plans to blow up Parliament on September 5. On that day  in 1605, Fawkes was to blow up Parliament. Fawkes was caught, tortured & hung. V wears a mask throughut. Natalie Portman is Evey & she's never been better. V saves her life & shortly she is involved in his activities. Both her parents had been murdered by this government & she has little use for it in any case. He does test her in a way that is cruel but ultimately helps her know her limits. They love each other but it is chaste & borne out of mutual admiration. I really like the whole feel of this movie. It did not feel like a futuristic fantasy. The old newsreels & faux news report made it seem very real. One the best movies in the last several years & highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R3O02O0PON4.html">A29R3O02O0PON4</a><br/><p>When this movie first came out, we were still in the middle of George Bush's 2nd term and the war in Iraq was not going so well.  So many people, including myself, viewed this movie as Left-wing propaganda in Great Britain projected onto the political climate in the US.  In fact, I hated the film, as it portrayed the terrorist as the good guy, or maybe in this case, the anti-hero.  BUT, as I rewatch this movie in 2009 with now ~9 months of the Obama Adminstration in charge of America, I see this "fascist" portrayal of the UK as more of a reflection of the current Obama Administration.  YES...I said it.  The Obama Administration.<br /><br />As we see in the movie, V's overall motive and theme is "People should not fear their government, the government should fear its people."  Sure, the Hitler-like and militaristic methods of the UK government in this film are a bit "right-wingish" imagery (which I'd argue is incorrect on the fact that Nationalized Socialism is anything but "right-wing"), BUT that aside, the policies of this UK government, like the stiffling of free speech, especially the comedic bit mocking the chancellor (oh, where have we heard that title before?  1936 Germany perhaps?) is exactly like what the Obama Adminstration is doing these days.  One example being telling a health insurance company to cease and desist their advertising campaign regarding the possible cut to Medicare.  Umm, First Amendment rights violation right there.  I don't care if the ad is correct or not, they have a right say it.<br /><br />And in the end of the film where we see a "mob" of people dressed in V's cape and mask ascend to the Parlimentary building to watch it blow up.  This is remanescant of the 9.12 March on Washington.</p></br><a href="../users/A38I00SO3D9ZSM.html">A38I00SO3D9ZSM</a><br/><p>Every conceivable, ridiculous cliche about conservative politicians is exaggerated to the maximum and crammed into this movie.  Imagine Michael Moore writing/directing Batman meets Zorro.<br /><br />V for Vendetta is visually impressive.  It has that dark feel of Tim Burton's films.  Hugo Weaving conveys more emotion from behind a mask than most actors can manage with faces fully exposed.  The fighting scenes -- what few there are -- are enjoyable.<br /><br />At the risk of giving too much away, the hero, V, is a modern-day Guy Fawkes, who is still remembered in England every year on November 5th.  Interestingly -- and without knowing beforehand the connection between V and Guy Fawkes -- I rented and watched this movie on November 5th.  If anything good came out of viewing V for Vendetta is that it made me want to learn more about Guy Fawkes. The movie was otherwise a disappointment.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>I have to say that I am not familiar with any of the comics, or had had any other contact with the characters apart from this movie so I cannot make any comparisons to other sources, nor can I take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have.  Therefore, coming from someone that did not "know" of V prior to the film I have to say... that I was rather disappointed!<br />V for Vendetta brings to the screen the not-so-impossible scenario that in the future England (or any western country for that matter) has become a dictatorship.  Subsequently, a man idolizing a 1605 failed attempt by Guy Fawkes to blow up the English parliament takes it upon himself to start a revolution in order to bring down the regime.  What the revolutionary does not anticipate is to find love in the midst of it all...  It's a bit like the X-Files meets "1984" with a bit of Matrix, and all that in a Marvel Comics universe.<br />On the positive side:<br />Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving, Stephen Rea, John Hurt, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!<br />Moreover, the special effects are pretty good.<br />On the negative side:<br />The film is way too political and too radical for the comics genre.<br />In addition, as in the case of the Michael Moore films, there are good and valid points, but the approach used is so radical and extreme that to a certain extent it backfires and may have the opposite effects.<br />Ridiculing law and order by portraying frequent curfews and constantly stating that they "are for your protection," may encourage lawlessness and anarchy.  Furthermore, the film comes to the defence of certain groups and minorities that mainstream people and common folk do not feel close or akin to, thus scaring them away from pressing matters such as who controls the media (which is something that is presented well in the film).<br />In a nutshell, V for Vendetta may not be a terrible movie, but it's also not what they've made it out to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q9YEG1XPEJN.html">A15Q9YEG1XPEJN</a><br/><p>V for Vendetta will not be a film that everyone will see. It is, however, a film that everyone SHOULD see.<br /><br />If this film didn't have source material that it is fairly faithful to, I'd say that the filmmakers wrote the script based on events of the last five years. That's how timely it is.<br /><br />Known to the public as a terrorist, V, is a man who dons a Guy Fawkes mask and costume and attempts to bring about a revolution in a near-future England. Along the way he befriends a young woman - Evey (Natalie Portman) - who inadvertantly becomes his friend.<br /><br />V for Vendetta is a very British film and that is a good thing. The cast is very British and very well schooled in their craft as character actors. As a result, the film is exciting, clean, crisp, and invigorating when it should be and dramatic and engaging when it should be.<br /><br />The script is tight and well written. The content....well, it's amazing how timely it truly is.<br /><br />V is the ultimate anti-hero. Sure, he is acting outside the law and performing acts that would constitute terrorism, but we must remember that the U.S. was founded on similar acts: the Boston Tea Party, the Revolutionary War, etc.<br /><br />This film is about change and how it is necessary for people to take their blinders off and see what is wrong in the world and actively participate in making the change come about.<br /><br />Amazing film!</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>I just finished watching what could be considered the futuristic British equivalent of America's Independence Day. This may be the wrong take on the story but here's what I got from a first viewing.<br /><br />In V FOR VENDETTA (USA/UK/Germany-2005), a mysterious man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask, black hat and cape plans to implode Westminster Palace as a way of getting out the truth to people being oppressed and controlled through a state-run TV network. At the end of a long, trying story on the stroke of midnight on November 5th (Guy Fawkes Day), a series of spectacular explosions fells the entire building along with Big Ben, while the coda of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture plays and a beautiful fireworks display lights up the night sky.<br /><br />And to think I saw this movie totally by accident during the overnight after July 4th, not knowing at all what would happen. (Another TWILIGHT ZONE moment).</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>The Wachowski Brothers, of "Matrix" fame, adapted "V for Vendetta" from the graphic novel by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, moving the action further into a dystopian future where Great Britain has exchanged obedient consent to totalitarian rule for order and peace in a world beset by violence and chaos. A single avenger (Hugo Weaving), calling himself "V" and wearing a smirking Guy Fawkes mask, plans to shake the population out of complacency and exact revenge on those who tortured him years ago. On the 5th of November, the anniversary of Guy Fawkes' 1605 Gunpowder Plot, V blows The Old Bailey sky high. And he warns that next year it will be the Houses of Parliament. Chief Inspector Eric Finch (Stephen Rea) is charged with finding V and his supposed accomplice, a young woman named Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) whom V saved from arrest when she was out after curfew. When he is not rabble-rousing, V is leaving a trail of murder victims, whom Finch traces to a detention center that housed top secret biological research years ago. But Finch's investigation attracts the displeasure of the Chancellor (John Hurt) and secret police chief Creedy (Tim Pigott-Smith).<br /><br />Although it is ostensibly an action movie, I found "V for Vendetta" mostly tedious and generally bland. "V" could as easily stand for "verbose" as "vendetta". V's wordy, philosophical oration would put the populace to sleep, not move them to arms. The plot is simplistic and the dialogue stilted, as you might expect of a graphic novel. The depth should be found in the story's ideas, but "V for Vendetta" comes up short in that department. Alan Moore, who wrote the comic, has criticized the American writers and director James McTeigue for transforming his conflict between anarchism and fascism in Britain into a critique of neo-conservatism in the United States. I have not read the graphic novel, so I must judge the film alone, which is an awkward mix of all of those ideas. There is a message about the politics of fear, as the fascist regime exploited fear of violence and disease to increase its domain in the name of national security. Citizens traded freedom for security, or the illusion of security, whether they really wanted to or not. This would be an interesting theme if it came across strongly, but unfortunately, the politics of fear is peripheral in the film.<br /><br />Much has been made of the idea that "V for Vendetta" casts a "terrorist" in heroic light. In fact, the film avoids the issue of terrorism almost entirely. V isn't much of a terrorist, and he's hardly heroic. He's an amoral, manipulative ideologue who treats his friends as badly as his enemies. His vendetta is one of personal vengeance. He blows up government buildings with no one in them. V doesn't kill civilians. His explosions are theater, complete with musical scores and fireworks. As terrorism is violence intended to leverage a political cause by creating fear, it would not be an effective tool against a regime whose power is rooted in the fact that everyone is afraid of the world around them. The government is the exploiter of fear, not V. So "V for Vendetta" is uniquely unsuited to comment on terrorism. V's violence is intended to be emblematic. It's vandalism, not terrorism. He's an anarchist. He targets institutions, not people. If you want to see a movie about revolutionary politics and terrorism, see "The Battle of Algiers", Gillo Pontecorvo's masterpiece of political cinema that has the added benefit of being true. "V for Vendetta" is the sum of shallow characters and nonsensical plot wrapped up in bland politics, and it's casual view of torture is indefensible.<br /><br />The DVD (Warner Brothers 2006 single disc edition): The single bonus feature is "Freedom! Freedom! Making V for Vendetta" (16 min), which consists mainly of interviews with producer Joel Silver, director James McTeigue, production designer Owen Paterson, and much of the cast, including Natalie Portman, Stephen Fry, Stephen Rea, John Hurt, and Hugo Weaving.

This movie have BETTER action scenes, special effects, story, concept and characters than Constantine and Count of Monte Cristo 2001.

Director James McTeigue working with a script provided by the Wachowski brothers and based of the novel by Alan Moore creates a socially critical film in the mode of the classic story "1984".<br /><br />In the year 2020 worldwide conflicts have fueled the creation of a totalitarian society in England led by the unyielding, dictatorial Chancellor Adam Sutler played powerfully by the accomplished John Hurt.  Having quashed the ideals of intellectuals, citizens live under fear of reprisal for wrong thinking.  Under these repressive conditons arises V, a lone voice attempting by terroristic acts to alter the shape of society.<br /><br />During one of V's escapades, he comes into contact with working girl Evey Hammond played by Natalie Portman.  She comes to his aid as he attempts to take control of the government run television station where she works.  They form an uneasy bond at first and V takes Evey in his confidence.  We learn that both Weaving and Portman are products of their society.  V was a survivor of a government sponored experiment into biologic warfare.  Portman survived the destruction of her family at the hands of an unsympathetic government.<br /><br />V who stealthily gets around in swashbuckling fashion cloaked with a Guy Fawkes mask throughout the film, has designs to make a stupendous terroristic statement on Guy Fawkes Day, November 5th.  He schools Evey in his philosophy and together they work towards making major changes into societal structure.<br /><br />The special effects and visual imagery were prodigious and the stunt work was also first rate.  Weaving, Portman and Hurt were all impressive in their portrayals.  Despite the cartoonish nature of the film, it did provide relevant critiques into authoritarian societies which deny its members a freedom of choice.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>While the movie started off rather ridiculously fake with all sorts of unusual voice acting, it eventually got better.  The only problem was the entire story wasn't interesting enough to care about, so after 50% of the film went by, I really lost interest.  I also didn't care for the slow motion effects showing people dying and blood squirting from their bodies.  The V character was decent, but he can't save an average film.

I get that out of the way at the top of this review because I know it will not be the popular opinion.  But at some point I've realized that I'm nobody if I'm not honest. So I'll say it right now, V FOR VENDETTA is not an action movie, it's a propaganda film.  It's a film about how great anarchy is.<br /><br />About 50 or 70 years into the future Great Britain is run by a totalitarian dictator (John Hurt).  Books, music, and all sorts of free expression are banned.  The government has created a police state that keeps people in line.  Then a shadowy masked figure named V (Hugo Weaving) steps out of the shadows and fights the government by exposing their corruption through terrorist actions.  Buildings are blown up, television signals are stolen, and caught in the middle of it all is Evey (Natalie Portman).  Evey, the reluctant student of the mysterious V, will play a pivotal role in overthrow of the government, whether she wants to or not.<br /><br />Now where do I start. On a purely cinematic level this movie is not very fluid. Most scenes revolve around characters talking about how horrible things are.  They talk and talk and then talk some more.  The screenplay is so verbose that any action you may have been expecting flashes by in seconds.  V's origin is told and retold at least 4 different times and there is a subplot involving an actress that just goes on and on.<br /><br />As for the rest of the film, the best scene involves a humorous take on the government.  It's bold and the man involved in the full on attack of the social order doesn't parade around in mask.  He's bold because he puts his name and face out for the world too see.  Yes he pays the consequences for his action, but he used the tools at hand to subvert the government.  He didn't need bombs, he didn't need violence, he just needed to be socially disobedient.<br /><br />But V this movies hero hides behind a mask of platitudes and terrorist actions.  He's too proud to put his face out there for the world to see.  He's like a man who writes a manifesto about how horrible the world is and signs it with an alias.  Who wants to listen to a coward. V believes that the only way to get people to listen is to blow things up and to murder the men in charge.  But what then?  Do you start another government?  Does that one become corrupt?<br /><br />I know its not a popular idea but did you ever just think that maybe human beings are rotten to the core? That our hearts are dark?  That if given the right circumstances we all could be Hitler? I know I've lied, I've stolen things, and I've hurt the people I love the most.  I've even made my wife cry and  I know there are people out there that think I'm a jerk. So I ask you am I good person? I strive to be, but the human condition drags me down.<br /><br />That's why we invent law.  Whether it be moral law, or traffic law, laws are put in place to fight against the human condition.  But Laws are so easily corrupted, from going 35 in a 25 miles per hour zone, or murdering your neighbor for his sneakers, we break laws because we are weak, selfish and at our cores we don't want anybody to tell us what to do.<br /><br />V operates in a place where humans are basically good except for those that disagree with him.  Government and greed are the problems.  He and those who agree with him are the ones who are right.  Organized religion is wrong. Politics is wrong. If we can somehow get rid of them the world will be a better place.  But alas isn't he himself turning his followers into robots? What if one of his followers challenged him?  Would he be labeled a traitor?  Would he be sent away?  The final outcome of V FOR VENDETTA may seem helpful, but why replace one tyranny for another.<br /><br />I know I've gone off on a tangent here. I know my comments may make some people angry. But alas I live in America and for all the horrible things that are going wrong,  I'm glad I can still thank God that I live in a country where many men and women strive to do what's right.  I can question my government without having to resort to terrorist actions and where men and women can believe what they want.  We are "One Nation Under God", be it a Christian God, or a Muslim God, or Zeus the God Of War.  My faith in America is not in the government.  My freedom is not protected by George W. Bush or V the mysterious masked vigilante.  It come from some place higher, some place stronger than myself.  Terrorism breeds more terrorism. Anarchy breeds nothing but chaos and V FOR VENDETTA is a horrible education in hedonism and nihilism.<br /><br />Do you want change the world?  It begins in the human heart. It begins when you strive to do good regardless of whether the Government is protecting you or not.  It's means dying not for self, but for others and striving for truth and not empty platitudes. V FOR VENDETTA is about a coward, and that's just sad.</p></br><a href="../users/A192KEPM0HW6AC.html">A192KEPM0HW6AC</a><br/><p>Much more hilarious than Thank You for Smoking--though unintentionally so--is V for Vendetta, the latest installment of the Wachowski brothers's downward slide into formulaic banality. Directed by James McTeigue, the veteran first assistant director of such fare as Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones and the Matrix trilogy, V is his first directing effort in which nobody but himself can be blamed for monumental ineptness.<br /><br />Upon its release, V for Vendetta sparked a lot of debate among libertarians and Objectivists about its anarchistic and nihilistic themes, and from that vantage point I was prepared to write this review. Easier said than done. After viewing nearly all four hours of this CGI special effects extravaganza (during which, inexplicably, the hands on my watch moved only two hours and twelve minutes), I scarcely found any dialogue coherent enough to be debated.<br /><br />Set in the England of the future, V for Vendetta centers around its "hero," V, played by Hugo Weaving. V is a refined man of culture (after all, who doesn't enjoy hearing Julie London sing "Cry Me a River"?), who surrounds himself with now-banned books. For you see, the great Fortress has been taken over by "Norsefire," a fascist theocracy. Its leader, Chancellor Adam Sutler, is a neo-conservative turned Big Brother, played by John Hurt. Just so the subtle novelty of a fuming and spitting despot who governs by Jumbotron isn't lost on the viewer, the makeup people made certain to give Hurt a shortish-cropped mustache and a slicked-back shock of hair reminiscent of a certain Austrian corporal we all know and love.<br /><br />Against this repressive backdrop, V nurses a four-hundred-year-old chip on his shoulder about the hanging of Guy Fawkes, who in 1605 tried to blow up the British Parliament. V also has a laundry list of personal grudges: he survived a secret government biological warfare experiment gone awry, as well as burns over one hundred percent of his body.<br /><br />All of this is meant to guarantee the viewer's sympathy for V's sociopathic killing spree as a knife-wielding assassin and mad bomber. After curfew, he prowls London's streets, avenging Norsefire's innocent victims. He hides behind a plaster Guy Fawkes mask, which appears rather stiff, though not as stiff as Weaving's acting.<br /><br />V happens upon our damsel-in-distress, Evey Hammond, played by the waifish Natalie Portman, whom he rescues from a back-alley rape at the hands of the curfew police, in a deftly-choreographed, computer-generated bloodletting by stainless-steel daggers that produce the requisite "swoosh" and "chunk" sound effects. V sure moves pretty fast and furious for someone who's suffered one-hundred-percent body burns. According to the actuarial tables, he shouldn't be moving at all; but that's a moot point.<br /><br />After dispensing with the goon squad, V introduces himself to Evey by way of an alliterative soliloquy containing forty-seven words beginning with the letter "V." It's meant to be charming and chivalrous, but comes off more like Snidely Whiplash doing a Jesse Jackson impression. V then asks Evey to accompany him for a night on the town, whereupon he blows up that citadel of British jurisprudence, the Old Bailey. Talk about fireworks on a first date!<br /><br />The next day, the government takes credit for his dynamiting job, claiming that Old Bailey was condemned as unsafe. Unfortunately, another side effect that V suffered in prison was an abiding and strident narcissism; so he takes over television broadcast studios to inform Londoners that he blew up Old Bailey, and that in one year--on the day Guy Fawkes burns in effigy--he will level Parliament. Through another subtle plot twist--Evey just happens to work as a gofer at the TV studio (surprise!)--V manages to sweep her up as his innocent accomplice. This sets up the tedium that follows, right up to the anticipated anticlimactic climax.<br /><br />V for Vendetta doesn't just rip off George Orwell's 1984; that would imply some sort of thematic unity. Rather, this schizophrenic action pic is a pastiche of at least a dozen works far greater than itself. When not squiring Evey about his secret lair a l&aacute; The Phantom of the Opera, V hunts down the bastards responsible for his fate in pale homage to The Count of Monte Cristo, while inciting the people to take back their country in a side plot embarrassingly reminiscent of that other "V"--the 1983 TV mini-series about invading aliens from outer space. The film snitches from cinematic styles and genres, too. There's even a flashback that seamlessly melds the innocence of awakening lesbian passion with lush Merchant-Ivory cinematography from the 1920s.<br /><br />Amidst all the slow-mo slicing and dicing, V is fond of chiding his deserving prey that "ideas do matter." In his televised appeal to the people, he lays the blame for their loss of liberty where it properly belongs, at their own feet. The film's tagline--"People should not be afraid of their governments; governments should be afraid of their people"--is a rather Jeffersonian conception that rings with the spirit of limited government.<br /><br />Yet for all its nods to individual liberty, V for Vendetta fetishizes freedom through its direct advocacy of anarchy. Justifying his annihilation of Parliament, V argues that "the world doesn't need a building, it needs an idea"--patently ignoring the ideas of common law and representative democracy that very building embodies. Thus we are brought to V's conclusion: By destroying the betrayed institutions of democracy, somehow, the people will regain their freedom.<br /><br />This is an obscenity to anyone who remembers his World War II history. From Parliament's halls, Winston Churchill rallied Britons in their "finest hour" to face down Hitler's Third Reich on the eve of the Battle of Britain. In their sick revision, however, the Wachowskis defeat the Nazis by leveling Parliament--never mind the fact that the Nazis burned down the Germans' Reichstag to consolidate power.<br /><br />Despite V's pompously vague appeals to the power of ideas, all that viewers are left with is a lot of the moral relativity piffle that leftist professors are so fond of quoting, to the effect that "one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter." Substitute the World Trade Center and the Pentagon for Old Bailey and Parliament, and you'll get the drift of this sickening allegory.<br /><br />Or, to drive the point closer to home, substitute, in Parliament's place, Columbine High School in suburban Denver. Before the murderous rage in which Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris massacred twelve schoolmates and a teacher, they produced an amateur video glorifying their school's wanton and nihilistic destruction.<br /><br />Thankfully, they took their own sorry lives immediately thereafter. Imagine what cinematic epics Klebold and Harris might have scripted from their prison cells. Their insane musings wouldn't have looked much different from this nauseating waste of celluloid.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ.html">A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ</a><br/><p>Outside of the TV commercials and movie trailers, I knew nothing about this film. I didn't even know it was taken from a comic book. Okay... color me ignorant. What I did know was that it had a very cool trailer, Natalie Portman starring, and the Wachowski brothers ("The Matrix") were behind it. As for the movie itself - I was disappointed with the main character. "V" fought the old school way with sharp words and long daggers. He wore a mask throughout the whole movie (showing no emotion whatsoever, obviously). He spoke like Shakespeare's evil twin brother... and I grew tired of it quickly. His ideals were that of a tragic vigilanty solely possessed on striking back at government - in an artsy idealistic kind of way. The movie starts with "V" hell bent on life - so unless you know something about the story before entering the theater - you have no idea where this inflamed scorn is coming from. The action sequences (minus the beginning explosions and Big Ben being blown apart at the end) were downright dull and a let down from previous Wachowski films. Is it possible to go into a movie with NO expections and come out with even less? My wife and I frequent the movies... and honestly, "V" is the worst movie I've seen in 2006 (so far).

'V For Vendetta' plays off the Fawkes legend, bringing it into the future with a sane and cultivated hero who hides behind a mask.<br /><br />'V' (Hugo Weaving), as he identifies himself, has been a victim of the oppressive political overthrowing of a free government, and decides that revolution and death are the only answers to the world's problems.  Despite the dark sound of his schemes, it makes sense in the wake of the current leader's greed and incompetence.  Just before his first message to the government, he rescues Evey (Natalie Portman) from a savaging from being out after curfew.<br /><br />'V' and Evey meet up again as 'V' takes over a public broadcast, and this time Evey help him in return for his kindness to her.  'V' then takes her to his underground hideout to keep her safe for one year, until next November 5th when he plans to carry out his designs for a new government.  When Evey gets away from 'V', he doesn't stop her.<br /><br />But neither 'V' or the government are through with Evey.  Evey becomes a prisoner and is tortured, emerging a stronger person from it.  Lots of secrets are revealed at this time, Evey's torturer, 'V's reasoning, and other sideline plots that were boring and belonged in a movie like 'Sleepless In Seattle' rather than 'V For Vendetta'.  'V' plans on bringing Evey in on his little November 5th celebration, whether she likes it or not, but not until he has taken care of his own personal business.<br /><br />'V For Vendetta' could have been a great movie if they had stuck to a darker vein and left out all the distracting touchie-feelie moments.  About the middle of the movie, where the 'emotional' aspect really takes off, is where I got lost, and bored, and began to see this film as a passing bow to the movie-rating God.  I would rather have seen 'V' more as a John Creasy from 'Man On Fire' than a sap who gives up his cause.  Perhaps the producers were a little too frightened by 911, thinking "terrorist" rather than "revolutionist", but because of the wishy-washy convictions of 'V' it simply turned into a sappy movie with a few scenes of excellent knifework and some stylish photography.<br /><br />My recommendation is to rent first, and make up your own mind.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>"V for Vendetta" is one of the most boring revolutionary epics I've ever watched.  With a screenplay and production by the Wachowski Brothers, I'd at least expect plenty of explosions and some neat special effects because, let's be honest, folks, the only reason that the first "Matrix" flick did very well was because of the whole slo-mo bullet biz.  After the initial shock, the sequels of that particular flick were nothing more than fluff.  However, it seems that the Wachowski boys were hoping that adapting a graphic novel (i.e. a really big comic book for adults too ashamed to admit they still read comics) with a Shakespeare-spouting, Fawkes mask-wearing, anti-hero/terrorist wannabe would make for a cool picture.  It almost did, but the fact is that Hugo Weaving's portrayal of "V" is so weighed down by theatrics that the viewer is more likened to take a nap than take up arms.  Natalie Portman delivers her standard wooden performance that won our hearts in the Star Wars prequels.  Why didn't they just go with an actual British woman to play her role?  Portman's only great performance was in "The Professional" with Jean Reno, and that was quite a few years ago.<br /><br />The story centers around a supposed terrorist who goes by the name "V."  He's mad at the government for making him into a hideous monster and has decided to overthrow said government by blowing up numerous British monuments and historically important buildings.  The only catch is that this "terrorist" politely allows all of the citizens inside the buildings to escape before he does his damage.  Doesn't quite sound like a terrorist to me.  Sounds more like a pest.<br /><br />The government head, gamely played by John Hurt, is supposedly meant to represent the current U.S. government.  However, the only thing that ran through my mind when we see Hurt's character screaming and ranting at his top officers was the same screaming and ranting done by Hilary Clinton, John Kerry, and perennial loser, Al Gore.  Hurt screams threats at everyone hoping to force them into submission.  He wants things his way and doesn't care what anyone else thinks.  He's a big baby, a dictator, just like many of today's liberal leaders attempt to be under the guise of "tolerance."  I hate to get political with this review, but a movie such as this begs to moved into that arena.<br /><br />The special effects are done fairly well, and the Wachowskis even pull the old bullet-time effect out of their dwindling bag of tricks except this time they use V's knives instead of bullets.<br /><br />I'll agree with other reviewers that this film does make you think.  A totalitarian government is an evil thing, but some sort of order is needed.  Without it, you have anarchy, and anarchy has never worked.  Why?  Because someone ultimately wants to be the leader.  To be a revolutionary with a clear idea of how things should be and the best way to engage those ideals is one thing, but to simply be a rebel without a reason is absurd.  This is a film about revenge, not revolution.<br /><br />If you loved the "Matrix" trilogy, you'll probably be disappointed by this flick.  The action is spread throughout a bogged down monologue by V and the end result attempts to be artistic, but falters in the end.<br /><br />Recommended as a rental only.</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>this movie borrows heavily from the george orwell classic "1984".the guy from "1984" is even in it.its all about this guy in a "funky french guy meets the joker" mask who uses terrorist methods to try and overthrow big brother.before you blow a gasket over the word "terrorist",hes not a kamikaze psycho in a turban hes more I.R.A. like.in other words hes fighting the good fight.this guy also has some sort of super powers they never really explain.he can dodge bullets like they do in "the matrix" and is super fast like "spider man".he is really good with a knife also.the chick in this movie is padme from star wars:episode 1-2 and 3.this movie combines elements of action,politics,sci fi and drama.it also has a "violent opera" feel to it like "a clockwork orange".its a really good sleeper film that wasnt hyped relentlessly while i was trying to watch wrestling but still delivered.so that was cool.this movie is good and  should see it!</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>I've never read the graphic novel (and I never will cause reading SUCKS), but I don't think you need to read it to appericate the movie.

The film raises several interesting philosophical questions but ultimately it is severely damaged by the type of political correctness all too often seen emanating from Hollywood.<br /><br />First, the movie raises the issue as to whether violence in any form is ever justified.  Obviously the absolute pacifist ethic runs into severe problems when put into practice and in extreme situations in which one must choose between one's own life and the life of a perpetrator.  Even the idea that one should never initiate force (although which may allow for force to be used in defense against force) runs into difficulties when faced with familiar scenarios such as a mother using force to prevent her child from running into traffic.  To this extent, I agree with the movie that force is permissible as a defense against unjust political regimes.  The movie also speaks to the power of symbolism and symbolic actions.  Thus, the destruction of parliament by the (ambiguous) "hero" V is justified in the movie through the idea that it represents a symbol of a corrupt regime that must be toppled.  Secondly the movie raises the issue as to the unethical nature of state sanctioned scientific experimentation on unwitting individuals.  Both totalitarian states and the United States government have engaged in such experimentation (consider for example, the CIA's experiments in mind control and LSD research).  To this extent, I agree with the basic message.<br /><br />However, despite my reserved agreement with this movie on these two points, I must note that its message is severely damaged by political correctness.  In today's world it is political correctness that poses the greatest totalitarian threat.  Despite the current regime's claim to be "conservative", Bush is in fact nothing of the sort.  The government continues to grow and impinge upon the liberties of American citizens.  (Your property can now be confiscated by the state to generate greater tax revenue according to a recent Supreme Court decision.)  Affirmative action and abortion continue to grow in magnitude.  Illegal immigrants continue to overrun the United States (as well as Europe).  And, valuable resources are being wasted on a senseless war in Iraq.  Whether the Democrats or the Republicans win the next election the results will be the same:  greater state interference in the lives of ordinary Americans and the continued threat of ever greater globalization.  In the movie, Christians and "fascists" play the role of unambiguous "bad guys".  The bishop who appears in the movie has an unsavory sexual appetite and is involved in the creation of the death camps.  Homosexuality is glorified and made to appear a victim of a fascist regime.  In today's world, political correctness is by far the stronger force and the various communist regimes which have been propped up through the help of finance capital are never mentioned in the movie.  While the fascists and Nazis murdered approximately 25 million individuals, the communists may have murdered as many as 100 to 200 million.  This difference is staggering.  Certainly government can be a great evil, but by painting all enemies of political correctness as proponents of the state, this movie has severely undermined its own premise.  This is especially ironic given the way in which politically correct forces collude with the state to censor and promote violence against those who disagree.  It is in this respect, that I firmly oppose what this movie stands for, despite its apparent philosophical interest.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>Man oh man, when they said "Sleeper Cell", they weren't kidding with this one.<br /><br />Call it Snoozer Cell. Or since we're discussing poor Jimmy McTeigue's awkward, mind-numbingly dull lobotomy of Alan Moore's brilliant and haunting "V for Vendetta"---and since it's set in not-so-jolly-old-England in the hazy, crazy future---then, in the spirit of the Cockney dialect why don't we just call it "F for Foooking Awful"?<br /><br />Try  "B for Bowdlerized": the cinematic "V" is one plopped into the digital blender and stripped of its drama, boiled down, recycled, pureed, bled dry of its horrible irony and all too balefully human black heart.<br /><br />McTeigue cut his teeth setting up the slick action shots for the Matrix flicks, and it shows: in "V" there is a doozy of a fight sequence, and it's a bracing example of what the flick might have been---balletic, nimble, unapologetically brutal, almost graceful.<br /><br />But then McTeigue---and his well-heeled handlers, the gender-bending Wachowskis---get down to business: sticking it to G.W. Bush and those fiendish Americans!<br /><br />The story, which needed no fiddling, is fiddled with, the better to make Hugo Weaving's black-hatted Hamlet a white-helmeted paragon of Freedom: the sinister, blighted landscape of post-Apocalyptic Britain at the guts of the graphic novel is replaced by a UK gone fascist after a bout of nasty pox. Evey is no longer a prostitute, with nowhere to turn: now she's a pert, preppy, abs-and-thighs of steel -production assistant.<br /><br />And so: gone is the dark, wicked, twisted, nimble brilliance of Alan Moore's sinister diptych set in a post-apocalyptic totalitarian England, replaced by something that plays like a "V" Cliff's Notes for the terminally ADHD-set.<br /><br />S for Subtext!

With that in mind, when she's not emoting her pretty little skull off or crying or writhing around on the ground in her cute little prison smock, clasping her little shaved-like-a-peach head---well God, blokes, is Natalie Portman not one peachy bird, baby? Yeah! I know the next time I dial up Madama Helga's I'll have to remember "V" and ask for the "Portman Schoolgirl Special". Rowrrrr, baby, behave!<br /><br />T for Teeth: as in, Jesus F*cking Christ the English have bad Teeth! When V's Halloween-party army takes over and the morning-after shivers wear off, the first act of legislation the new Government of the People should pass is one of free orthodontics: if whatever they were doing over at Larkhill caused these plaguey-bad choppers, then V was onto something, after all!<br /><br />Oh yes, and T for Thespians, too! Whatever "V"'s faults, the acting is nearly sublime: all hands man their battle stations, and go down with this reeking turd---but throw out some fine performances along the way. Portman turns in the performance of her career as Evey; Stephen Rea (Finch) sulks his way through another flick; Stephen Fry (the snaggle-toothed Gordon) rejoices that he's at least not in "Gosford Park"; John Hurt (Sutler) twirls his mustachios; and Hugo Weaving phones it in from beneath a heart---or face, anyway---of Oak.<br /><br />D for Deep Pockets! As in, where the h*ll did the freewheeling, itinerant V get enough money to afford Guy Fawkes costumes for the entire population of the British Isles? And come to think of it, wouldn't that sort of order have attracted notice? "Made to order: 20 million Guy Fawkes outfits. COD."<br /><br />B for Burkha! Which is what all the popcorn chomping cuties who left the theater wondering why the action quotient wasn't higher had better start fitting themselves for, if the general consensus is that terrorism is cool, blowing buildings up is groovy, and that the Koran is our flipbook for freedom.<br /><br />In the end, it's all M for Mediocrity, and more's the pity. Our shadowy latter-day Guy Fawkes does what he has to do, and serves as an exemplar of stealthy, shadowy urban terror: setting off fertilizer bombs in the bowels of London, whacking the errant, gouty, ulcerated perverted Archbishop (aren't they all, nowadays?), strapping himself up with TNT and parading into a broadcast booth, slitting throats with gay abandon.<br /><br />But the Wachowskis have deprived their Shakespearean anarachist of a suitable foe. In Moore's original, the dictator Adam Susan (renamed Sutler in the cinematic outing, so as to further underscore the Hitler/Bush parallel to the brain-challenged in the audience) was a worthy adversary, if only because he was just as deranged as V, and as equally devoted to his outsized notions of Order as V was to his unrequited love for abstracts like Justice and Liberty: arguably, they were mirror images.<br /><br />It's amusing that "V" gets raves for thumbing its wooden nose at Bush's America, where even illegal aliens feel free to march for their 'rights'---when this very instant in the Sudan---surely V's anarchic state of nature, a realm where the people are assuredly *not* afraid of their government because it no longer exists---men are slaughtered for the mistake of belonging to the wrong tribe.<br /><br />"V" might have landed a roundhouse if it had pitted its Angel of Righteous Destruction against a truly committed avatar of Order---not the ranting Hitler-lite Sutler. Sadly, "V"'s latter-day Guy Fawkes---reduced each year to a straw-man, and burned in effigy---is pitted against an even more hopeless Straw Man, and the film dies for it.<br /><br />"V for Vendetta" is ultimately crucified on a cross of mediocrity.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A2LBG01YBSUP96.html">A2LBG01YBSUP96</a><br/><p>T for Talkitive,B for Boring,or it could still be V for Vidiculous.this is comparable to a pop song;bland verses,heard it before choruses,lameassed solos.....but inbetween the muck theres an interesting bridge.in this yapfest,there are brief moments of action.this seems to be a trend in gollywood;either too much unbelievable action sequences,or unbelievably long winded talkathons.it seems that gollywood is trying to give us our monies worth not with good movies but in their length of time.as long winded as this is,another 10 hours wouldnt have made this yapfest any better/more coherent.ok,V(hugo weaving,PERHAPS,it could have been only his voice for all we know)has a grudge against the government of new america Aka Britain.as a guinea pig in a correctional facility,he was horribly burned and tortured when the place blew up.fast forward a decade or so and hes built himself a palace/batcave where the subways once was(of course the brilliant new government kept the underground wide open).i wouldnt have been surprised if the new government helped V place his jukebox.he begins his plot for a new revolution against this new government by blowing up its symbol of strength,parliment.V starts off by doing a test run on demolishing a semi important building.V then makes it to the tv station where the new regime sells its propaganda to make his plans known.natalie portman sports an adequate accent and is in better form than the abysmal final stars wars charactor she cried her way through.nevertheless,she is reduced to once again assuming the female role;whimpering until she is saved.anyway,by this time i was in and out of a dreamstate,the never ending blabbering can do that.i wont be the one to tell you how this ends(P for Predictable ?!?!?!?!?) but rest assured,gollywood will revisit this franchise in the making.surfice it to type,i wont be going along for the ride.unfullfilled hype once got the better of me!!!! fool me once</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>The most creative moments of "V for Vendetta" are during its flashy end credits, bathed in red, played over The Rolling Stones' "Street Fighting Man."<br /><br /> No kidding.<br /><br /> The movie is a tremendous artistic letdown. Drab. Pompous. Obvious. So liberal it cannot possibly be considered a sincere allegory, but rather a preach-to-the-choir rant that Michael Moore would appreciate. At least Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" had the juice to stick it to the Bush administration - "V" merely wishes it so - and did not cloak its intentions behind an advertising campaign that features star Natalie Portman - who until now was Hollywood's staunchest defender of Israel, the closet thing we've got to a police-state democracy - in roundtables discussing the nature of terrorism.<br /><br /> The Wachowski Brothers chose to adapt Alan Moore's graphic novel as their encore to "The Matrix" trilogy, inserting the second unit director from those films, James McTigue, as director here. Set 20 years in the future, England has fallen into tyranny, with Hitleresque High Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) helming a government that enforces curfews, shapes the news to fit its agenda and employs "fingermen" to execute its ultra-conservative rulebook. It's these men that harass Evey Hammond (Portman) in a London back alley one night with the intent of raping her when a man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask disarms them, rescues the girl and sweeps her to the rooftop so she can watch him bomb Old Bailey.<br /><br /> The man is V (Hugo Weaving), a survivor of government experiments hot for payback and revolution, using the mask of Fawkes - who tried to blow up British Parliament in 1605 - to cover his disfigured face. Theatrical, talky, tortured, brilliant, V is a political Phantom, and London is his Opera House. And shy, observant Evey is the girl he'll come to love. The morning after Old Bailey comes down, V hijacks the state-run TV network and announces he will, in one year, finish what Fawkes started. He invites all of England to come and see.<br /><br /> Evey is linked to V, and has no choice but to hide out with him, at least until she can escape. She succeeds, but eventually lands in state prison, where she is tortured to divulge V's whereabouts. If, in fact, she really is in state prison.<br /><br /> "V For Vendetta" is not without its clever twists. Or sincere performances - Portman is especially invested and effective, and Stephen Rea, as a police inspector charged with finding V, pads his resume of taciturn, shambled cops.  The weaknesses are McTigue's boring direction  and the Wachowski Brothers' script in its lack of continuity and tone - the background touches that make movies like "Blade Runner," "A Clockwork Orange" and "Minority Report" challenging meditations on the future.<br /><br /> We never get a handle on the government, omnipresent in some scenes, absent in others. Considering his past, it's unlikely V would have the access to the unlimited quantities cash needed to execute his Parliament plan, which is straight out of "Shawshank Redemption" anyhow. And one can buy only so many moments when a key face looms just out of the spotlight or the second most-wanted terrorist in England can walk around easy breezy because she has a shaved head and a fake ID.<br /><br /> The Wachowskis are also too occupied with their liberal markers and props to create an effective argument. V has leather-bound books, art and movie posters in his cave. That means he's wise. A friend of Evey's hides a Koran preserved in glass. That means he's tolerant. The government's symbol is a weird variation on the Christian cross. That means Christianity is twisted.<br /><br /> Then there's the Wachowski's agenda of sexual freedom - buried in the subtext of "The Matrix" series, but front and center in "V For Vendetta" (and previously "Bound"). A government can violate a thousand rights, and yet the movie chooses as its two testimonials a gay man and a lesbian robbed of their desires. Since the picture never exactly articulates the government's other targets, yet we're certain they exist, we're left with sense that "V For Vendetta" places gay rights at the top of its freedom hierarchy, and that tyranny strikes first at gays, and society through them, similar to the Nazis persecution of the Jews.<br /><br /> A scarier, tougher movie goes right at the heart of V's thesis statement - "government should fear its people" - and examines it through a activist with whom it's not so convenient for the literati to side. Consider America's own twisted V - not the 9/11 terrorists, but Timothy McVeigh, the conservative wing nut who blew up a federal building in response to the FBI's raid on Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas. Raised on a rich diet of reciprocity, militarism and hatred, McVeigh nevertheless had an intriguing point to make about the violations of our Second Amendment gun rights. He was a modern Guy Fawkes, he spoke of collateral damage and revolution, and when it came time to line up behind him, we instead put his execution on close-circuit television so the victim's families could watch him die.<br /><br /> Just in case you forgot "V For Vendetta" was a fantasy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1T3O2LILVK0C4.html">A1T3O2LILVK0C4</a><br/><p>"The people always have some champion whom they set over them and nurse into greatness. . . . This and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs; when he first appears he is a protector."<br />-Plato<br /><br />In the 1980s comic books took a revolutionary turn (one the likes of which had not been seen since the `60s and `70s) and became politically and socially relevant again. These were the days of conservative and consumerist values, when Ronald Reagan was president and Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister. A Cold War was being fought and the lines between freedom fighter and terrorist, democracy and imperialism were quickly dissipating. It was in this political climate that David Lloyd and Alan Moore created <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/140120841X">V for Vendetta</a>, a highly intelligent graphic novel series. V for Vendetta was brilliantly written and illustrated and helped to prove that comic books weren't just for children; they were literature. The film V for Vendetta is based upon the graphic novel and was written by the Wachowski Brothers (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002Y69NG">the Matrix Trilogy</a>).<br /><br />"As in private life one differentiates between what a man thinks and says of himself and what he really is and does, so in historical struggles one must still more distinguish the language and the imaginary aspirations of parties from their real organism and their real interests, their conception of themselves from their reality."<br />-Karl Marx<br /><br />In a bleak totalitarian future, Britain has become a cesspool for corruption, conformity and brutality. People's civic rights are being severely violated by the government, under the leadership of Chancellor Sutler. The people are misguided, apathetic, and fearful of the harsh regime that rules over them but that's about to change. One night a young woman named Evey is caught by corrupt police officers after curfew. They intend to rape her but astonishingly (or predictably, if you're a comic book expert) she is saved by a costumed vigilante, who wears an antiquated mask of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385471904">Guy Fawkes</a>. His name is V and he has a deep hatred of the current government, a hatred that was born when he was tortured and experimented upon. He invites Evey to join him on the rooftops fro a "concerto" which he will conduct himself. Reluctantly she agrees to go and there she watches in shock and amazement as V detonates the Old Bailey. The next day a police squad is sent to obtain her for questioning but V shows up and saves her... sort of. He takes her back to his underground lair where he makes her breakfast and asks her to join him in his revolution. She agrees but only does so with the intention of escaping. V uses Evey to gain access to his targets but she manages to get away. Soon she is caught and arrested. She spends months in a small gloomy cell being tortured and interrogated before she is released and learns to master her fear. Meanwhile Chancellor Sutler increases his power over the population by overwhelming them with misinformation in the media. He utilizes scare tactics and military force to keep any dissidents in line but the people grow quietly more rebellious. V has promised them a revolution will commence on November the 5th and he has planned to liberate them and avenge those who have been wronged. But is he a lunatic or a hero, a guerrilla freedom fighter or a monstrous killer? Maybe he is all of those things as well as being the only hope for ending Chancellor Sutler's wicked regime... and yet at what cost?<br /><br />"One who breaks an unjust law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law."<br />-Martin Luther King, Jr.<br /><br />The film is skillfully directed by newcomer James McTeigue and features an amazing cast including Hugo Weaving as V, Natalie Portman as Evey, and John Hurt as Chancellor Sutler. Other cast members include Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, Roger Allam and Sinead Cusack.<br />V for Vendetta is a disquieting film, a film that is thought provoking and questions authority. It daringly asks questions about the world in which we live but it leaves us to find the answers. The film is understandably controversial, especially in the age of terrorism, distortion in the media, genocide, biochemical warfare and rampant political corruption. The story shows us the dangers of combining religious fanaticism, puritanical thinking, and social intolerance while handing the government complete control. The film certainly won't appeal to many conservatives or centralists. It's an extreme film that attacks extreme problems. Even Alan Moore disassociated himself from it, feeling that the screenplay was not faithful to his story*. Yet despite the film's many flaws it remains very relevant to the issues we face in modern society.<br /><br />"You can't separate peace from freedom because no one can be at peace unless he has his freedom."<br />-Malcolm X<br /><br />* For an interview with Alan Moore about his disapproval of the film adaptation, check out the following site:<br />http://www.mtv.com/shared/movies/interviews/m/moore_alan_060315/</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>V For Vendetta certainly tackles some provocative and timely themes: media and government manipulation, and terrorism and the old adage that power corrupts and governments will single-handedly manipulate the populace to stay in power.  The film is packed with ideas - sometimes a little too many - but it's a smartly designed and superbly acted thriller and it actually gives you something to think about while you're watching the Britain's Parliament House get blown up.<br /><br />V For Vendetta indeed presents a scary scenario. It is England in 2020. The effects of world instability, including the downfall of the United States, have finally reached the country and now fascist political party has come to power, in the form of a draconian Thatcherism predicated on order, conformity and intolerance.<br /><br />With the government mushrooming into totalitarian repression, the public is controlled through police repression, surveillance and propaganda - particularly through the media. High Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt) is a despot who rants from giant video monitors. Homosexuality or owning a Koran - unauthorized love and unauthorized faith - are capital crimes and free speech is seen as a disloyalty to the party, to the government and to the country. Into this mix comes the freedom fighter V (Hugo Weaving) who wears a mask and models himself in Britain's most famous revolutionary, Guy Fawkes.<br /><br />V is a revolutionary and an ideologue, his conversation is dense with analysis and philosophy; his fortress of solitude isn't a museum of weaponry, but a vast library and art gallery. He is a fearsome hand-to-hand fighter, who thinks of nothing of murdering to make his point. The center of his campaign is the protection of Evey (a ravishing Natalie Portman) when he saves her from being menaced by the secret police for violating curfew.<br /><br />The police (led by Stephen Rea and Rupert Graves) suspect that Evey is his accomplice, and V takes her into his sanctum for her own protection. As she witnesses him blow up the Old Bailey, Every falls ever more into V's revolutionary web. The screenplay by the Wachowski Brothers parallels areas of government surveillance, torture, fear-mongering and media manipulation, not to mention corporate corruption and religious hypocrisy, the references to current events being opportune depending on your world view.<br /><br />Whilst the back-story involving both Evey and V's past is a little convoluted, the Director James McTeigue adroitly visualizes the multifaceted story and keeps the action moving at a fast pace. At times, the script is a little overly alliterative and a section involving Stephen Fry's television host is filmed in such a way that it's hard to tell what's going on.<br /><br />The actors, however, are all suburb: Portman is wrenching as the victimized Evey, well matched by the masked Weaving, who crafts a terrific performance from body language and vocal inflections. Although V for Vendetta is not without its faults, it's still a timely, surprisingly entertaining and totally thought-provoking film on a future-world that could so easily come about in any country given the right political environment. Mike Leonard August 06.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>The year is 2020 and the people of Great  Britain are blind. It's not entirely their fault--the government in the persona of High Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) has put blinders on the British as much as they are too frightened to see what is happening for themselves.<br /><br />Britons' everyday world is very much like George Orwell's "1984".  The heavily censored media controls what they see.  Language has morphed to the point where harmless words now carry a serious threat. The Party is all-powerful and can make people disappear without questions.  The countryside is mined with cameras and microphones to detect any protest and the police and military are empowered to eliminate enemies of the state. The Government may well be responsible for the deaths of over a 100,000 of its citizens due to St. Mary's virus.<br /><br />Then one dark November 5th night, Evey Hammond (Portman), a young British woman is walking home and is accosted by men bent on doing her harm.  She's rescued by a black clad figure in a Guy Fawkes mask.<br /><br />He calls himself "V."<br /><br />V (Hugo Weaving) offers truth and hope to the British people.  Taking his cue from the Guy Fawkes of history who tried to overthrow the British Government almost 4 centuries prior, V promises that in a year's time, there will be a revolution--the Parliament building will be destroyed and the old government will be overthrown.<br /><br />The film covers the next year's time.  First, the police are attempting to locate V through various means.  Evey parts from V and goes out on her own only to be captured.  And V continues to spread the word to the British people.<br /><br />Every book writer aspires to at least one good line per page.  I cannot say how many that translates to in movies, but "V" is beautifully and thoughtfully written.  In addition, the acting on the part of the major characters is good as well.  How Weaving can translate so much character without a facial expression, eludes me.  Natalie Portman's performance as Evey in captivity is also stellar.<br /><br />As I started off, I really regret not having seen this film in full screen.  I understand it's available in IMAX format and I'd love to catch it on that kind of venue.  In particular, the scenes from High Chancellor Sutler would probably be hair raising.<br /><br />Though I have rented this film, it's now on my wish list to add to my collection.  There is enough content to make "V" worth watching again--and showing to my friends.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>The directors of the Matrix films bring us V for Vendetta "although they just wrote the screenplay and don't direct it". The great Hugo Weaving who played Agent Smith in those films stars here and is excellent considering he wears a mask the whole time. He brings charm and class to the role while also makes you feel bad for anyone who has to cross him. He plays a hero/terrorist trying to find justice in a world controlled by an evil dictator.<br /><br />  He isn't your ordinary hero, he doesn't mind killing people what so ever. He goes around killing the people who's fault it is that he got burnt badly and then leaves a rose on their corpse. He gets help from a women played by Natalie Portman who deep down also hates how the world is. Since her parents were taken from her and executed when she was little. Together they try to stop the evil dictator played by John Hurt, as a cop played by Stephen Rea (The Crying Game) trys to track them down and stop V. The movie is dark and very very violent but it also has heart  and a compelling story with romance on the side. It has Natalie Portman giving a better performance than she did in all 3 StarWars prequels. Well although the role is sorta similar to her role in the Professional. Where she falls for her mentore but can never actually be with him.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ICW5OUWX2A2V.html">A2ICW5OUWX2A2V</a><br/><p>This could be the most dangerous movies of 2006.  How is that?  Well, for one thing it's main charachter is what you could call a terrorist.  Second, the film takes a hard look at the world as it may come to pass, a world where individuals set aside freedom in the name of security and peace.  If nothing else, V for Vendetta is the film that revolves around Benjamin Franklin's saying, "They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."<br /><br />V for Vendetta (VFV) is a creepy movie.  How so?  It shows just what could happen if Hitler and the Nazis suddenly returned, regained power and established a new dictatorship governement.  It's big brother for the twenty first century, and it's chilling.  The government is made up of cold and emotionless police and government agents who do thier job (kidnappings, beatings, etc.) with chilling efficency.  Propoganda is played on the television.  Curfews are in effect every night.  And let's not even start talking about the detainment centers...<br /><br />Seeing this big brother government of the twenty first century is chilling.  It resembles our current state of affairs pretty well, except for all the nasty dictator stuff.  The arrest scenes (where police break into homes and carry away ordinary people) are downright chilling.  This is NOT a place you want to live.  Yet it's a fascinating look at what may happen.  The story takes place sometime in the early-mid twenty first century.  The united states has broken up into civil war over the war in the middle east which has lasted for decades.  Religious fanatics have poisioned thousands in Briton.  The movie is a fascinating study into how fear will make people do crazy things to feel safe again (such as elect power hungry maniacs who promise peace).  At one point early on, V (the title charachter) tells the public to simply look in a mirror to see who is responsible for what has happened.<br /><br />It is because of this that VFV is a warning to us, that if we give in to fear, this just might happen.  But it doesn't stop there.  Oh, no, it doesn't stop there by a long shot.<br /><br />VFV is very deep on many levels.  When you see it the first time, you can tell that there's a lot here, yet you only get a glimpse at it.  When you see it a second time, you get a better grasp of the messages being put forth, yet there is still more to see and more to discover.  In many ways VFV is like the first matrix movie.  The deeper you go into the rabbit hole, the more you are going to find. There's even a great idea behind V's mask and his face, but i'll let you figure that one out for yourself (it's fantastic, I will say that much).<br /><br />Arguably the best part of the entire film is V himself.  Not since Hellboy has the silver screen seen such a fascinating comic book charachter come to life.  V is intriguing, a very polite gentleman (when he's not out killing people), a fan of movies, a good cook (very amusing scene by the way), and always has that oh-so charming smile on his face (granted it's a mask, but it works so well).  His actions make him a Han solo charachter, not totally good, not totally bad.  He can be both a freedom fighter and a terrorist, depending upon how you see his actions.  Which one is he?  The movie lets you decide that for yourself, though it does lean towards freedom fighter.  With his charming personality, black cape, black hat and that awesome mask, V is an utterly fascinating charachter who is a delight to watch.<br /><br />The movie even touches upon the subjects of religion and homosexuality in a way that can best be described as creepy.  Because religious fanatics (the film does not say what faith these fanatics were) have apparently done so much damage that religions are now completly banned.  The issue of how homosexuals are treated is truly disturbing.  In this horrible future, homosexuals are routinely arrested and have all sorts of...well, i'll let you see for yourself. It is my hope that this world does not descend to this level of barbaric cruelty.<br /><br />While VFV may be a movie about revolution, dont go in expecting lots of action.  This is a movie about ideas (this is one of the main themes) and how ideas affect people.  That's not to say that there is no action, for there are some really well done sequences (especially a big fight near the end where V really gets to show off his fighting ability with knives).  There's also some very cool shots of huge crowds at the climax, though i'll let you see that for yourself.<br /><br />Even with all the gloominess and dictatorship going around, VFV does have some very effective humor sprinkled in.  There's a fantastic moment where V cooks breakfast for Evey, and there's an absoloutly hilarious TV special halfway through the movie that had me laughing in the theater.  It's so funny that it would be a crime to reveal what it is, so i'll let you find out for yourself.<br /><br />In the end, VFV is a movie about ideas.  What can happen to those who are afraid, and how ideas are things that you cannot control or kill ("Underneath this mask is a face and underneath that is muscles and bone.  Yet I am more then that").  It's a very thought provoking movie, one that is chillingly familiar to those of us living in this age of homeland security and the conflict with terrorism.  Highly recommended.</p></br></body></html>

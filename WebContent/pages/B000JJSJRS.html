This is the sequel and is so much better than the original.  The basic plot: some evil Arab dudes have resurrected Imhotep, chief royal advisor to long-gone Egyptian pharaoh Seti I, in order to power him up enough to take out a bad-ass known as the Scorpion King (played magnificently by The Rock)- and of course, Evie and her husband (Frasier) must kill either the Scorpion King or Imhotep to prevent the other from taking over the world.  The DVD is definitely your best choice for this flick; the VHS and DVD contain the same movie but the DVD has much better quality visuals and a hell of a lot more special material. (Unfortunately, only the VHS version has the music video for "Forever May Not Be Long Enough" by Live [a song from the soundtrack and a perfect pick, in my opinion]).  I leave you with these words spoken by the family guardian: "My friend, there is a fine line between coincidence and faith."  From a movie containing quite a bit of Christian material, this line is a perfect addition to an already great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B8GXSCB1R05T.html">A2B8GXSCB1R05T</a><br/><p>"The Scorpion King" is one of the most blatantly flawed films that I have ever enjoyed.  The plot is so telegraphed that the whole sum of the film can be figured out in the first few minutes.  Kelly Hu's outfits boarder on the ridiculous.  Her clothes would be better suited for a Jenna Jameson movie, and are so out of place in several of the action scenes that they elicit a chuckle.  The film is like a James Bond movie with barbarians, in this respect.  <p>And yet...I enjoyed it!  Maybe I was in the right mood for it, or maybe the director balanced that fine line between camp and drama.  Dwayne Johnson made an incredibly intelligent choice to eliminate the personality and trademarks of "The Rock" (With the exception of a quick glimpse of "The People's Eyebrow") and develop a new character.  Honestly, I think the film is carried by his personal charisma.  I would be happy to see him in more films.  Michael Clarke Duncan is woefully under used.  He is a true actor, and should have been allowed to be more than a stereotypical buddy/brute.  In an interesting twist, Steven Brand as the villain Memnon does not come close to matching The Scorpion King's mass but is a surprisingly believable threat.<p>This movie is not nearly as good as the original "Conan," but it is also not nearly as bad as the endless pile of copies that have followed it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q.html">A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q</a><br/><p>I greatly enjoyed  "The Mummy" when it was resurrected several few years ago.  I can recall many late hours spent watching Zacherlee and Shock Theater, entranced by the antics of a whole slew of monsters, with The Mummy being one of the most memorable.  In those days movies still had to have plots and spooky atmospherics to do what we do with special effects and a truckload of gore today.  <p>What made the new "Mummy" fun was not just the updated effects.  It also had just the right tongue-in-cheek attitude.  Let's face it, mummy movies are high camp.  Abbott and Costello figured it out first, but it took decades before Universal Pictures discovered the same secret.  Now, as in the original film series, we are offered a sequel, once again called "The Mummy Returns."<p>Set 10 years later than the time of the first movie, Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) have married and have an 8-year-old son, Alex (Freddy Boath).  They have returned to Egypt seeking the Bracelet of Anubis, an ancient artifact associated with the legendary Scorpion King of Egypt's fabled past.  In doing so they trigger an adventure that will have them chasing all over the Egyptian map.  For, not far from the O'Connell dig, a group of nefarious cultists are once again resurrecting the mummy of the evil Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), the real star of the first movie.<p>Imhotep's has plans for the Scorpion King (The Rock) and his minions which require the bracelet.  He would also like to even the score with the O'Connells, who foiled his first return.  When Alex inadvertently puts on the Bracelet of Anubis, and is kidnapped, he triggers a chase scene that stretches from England to Abyssinia.  Imhotep and his beloved Ankh-so-namun (Patricia Velasquez) use every dirty trick in the book in their plan to conquer the world.  Before Alex (and life as we know it) is rescued, our doughty heroes will be treated to every kind of adventure and mishap, including  reincarnation, dirigible rides, pigmy zombies, and the Scorpion King himself.<p>The actors are perfectly in character, capturing the thrill and fun without any sense of overacting.  The effects are gorgeous.  The DVD does a wonderful job of capturing the film, modifying it to fit the television screen without excess or glaring distortion.  As on would expect, there is a host of bonus features, including interviews, outtakes and countless explanations of the effects.  Several games and the required screen savers and wallpaper are all provided.  Great fun for all.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>In The Mummy, we saw unlikely characters come together to face an unspeakable evil.  You had an ex Legionnaire, played by Fraser, a clumsy but beautiful librarian (Weisz), her gold hungry brother, and an Arabian holy warrior fighting to keep a mystical mummy from coming to full power.  It was a great romp and we had a blast watching it.  In my opinion, the best thing about the Mummy Returns is that not only does the Mummy return, so does everyone else...well at least everyone who may not have died in the first one.  It is great to see all the familiar characters come back.  Once again, the believability and plot are stretched to their limits but also once again, the movie moves at a blinding pace.  The action and story are well structured, and the script is solid, if not hokey at times.  The story is more original, dealing with the reincarnation of Imhotep's lover as well as raising the Mummy again as well.  A chase begins, as Rick and Evelyn (and friends) pursue Imhotep and his allies across the desert.  In the tradition of making a sequel bigger and better, the formula sometimes gets too big for it's own borders, but director Stephen Sommers seems to know when to draw the line in most cases.  He maintains control and still keeps the movie from going awry.  The special effects are once again incredible, but in some places, too much CGI may have been used.  The fight scene at the end would have been better if they had toned down certain aspects.  I won't say more about it for fear or ruining it for those who may not have seen it, but if you liked the first movie, there is no reason why you wouldn't like this one.  You may not like it as much, or you may like it more.  But like the first one, take it for what is; entertainment.  Nothing more.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4.html">A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4</a><br/><p>This being the most sucssesful summer movie of 2001 , everyone is back for a bigger and better the second time around.

The original Scorpion King was not The Rock, but another guy who with fast reflexes is hard to kill.  He can catch arrows in his bare hands and can deflect weapons with his sword.  He's the best swordsman ever and he's also ruthless.<br /><br />Plots:  I did enjoy the themes of revenge and a thirst for power and how power corrupts.  Not so good was the martial arts fighting - I doubt there were martial arts fighing in pre-Biblical times!  The casual mentions of Biblical cities, such as Sodom & Gomorrah, was interesting as well.<br /><br />The fast action was great, with Dwayne Cooke's crazy arrow scenes (where an arrow can hit you and has enough momentum to punch you out of a bar!), the pause as the beautiful sorceress he has been hired to kill falls in love with him, and the bad old King who finally loses his kingdom.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Making one's own destiny is a lot of work, and the Rock does so out the top!  Kelly Hu as the sorceress is well worth the price of admission.  If you like non-stop action and some scenes that make absolutely no sense but are fun to watch, then rent this film.<br /><br />The Mummy Trilogy is better:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IEVW6E">The Mummy (1999)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IEZP8K">The Mummy Returns</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001R02W4Y">The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor</a></p></br><a href="../users/A15U64VGUV6RBF.html">A15U64VGUV6RBF</a><br/><p>Features a terrific cast, amazing digital effects and a very inventive take on the story of The Mummy.

The Scorpion King doesn't really feel like it's in either the same class of movies or even the same series in a number of ways. Not that I hate it, but it doesn't exactly compare to the other two. For the price, however, it's a good set.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ARJ16772TKHT.html">A3ARJ16772TKHT</a><br/><p>After the first two Mummy movies, this one just doesn't exactly feel like it belongs entirely.

In comparison, this one feels like there's barely any mysticism in it at all.<br /><br />Going in, you'd think the movie would largely feature the event shown in The Mummy Returns where the Scorpion King makes his deal with the devil, so to speak. But that doesn't come into play at all.

Rick (Brenden Fraser) is now married and it's up to him and his wife to save their son from these forces of evil.

I personally have always liked "The Rock" especially when he was a heel in wrestling, so when I heard he was going to be in "The Mummy Returns" it seemed a natural fit. Maybe some day I will get into that movie but my over all feeling from him was he did a good job with his first role. As a pro wrestler it seems a natural fit for him to move over into movies, he certainly is better than Hogan by a long shot.<br /><br />This is a prequel to the aforementioned Mummy film and as an off shoot or sequel or whatever you want to call it this is pretty good. The story is about an ancient time, apparently before the time of the pyramids [even though the sequel to this which is also a prequel would contradict that], were a great warrior became a king. This king along side a fine sorcerer dominated all other kingdoms and became a tyrant destroying all who opposed him thanks to her visions. That is until the last of a people who are known to be the deadliest of assassins are hired by the remaining tribes to kill the sorcerer. So Mathayus [Dwayne Johnson/The Rock] and his two other fellow people are off to kill Cassandra the sorceress, they fail in their attempt and only Mathayus is left alive. Still he wakes up with his entire body buried except for his head and there are some hungry ants looking for some food. This is were he meets his new partner in crime the slippery thief Arpid, the two make for an amusing pair [every hero needs a comic relief side kick]. From here the two battle the king and his armies, go through massive sand storms, take the sorceress, and do battle with a tribe of all female warriors [sounds like a good time, especially that last part].<br /><br />While this movie certainly has flaws it is one of those turn off your brain for a while and just relax type flicks. The acting is solid and the action is good not to mention there is some very nice eye candy for all us fellas, ladies I suppose you have The Rock to look at. Director Chuck Russell does a good job here with the action in particular as that is the main reason this film was made, and writers Stephen Sommers, Jonathan Hales, William Osborne, and David Hayter did a decent job with the script. It feels flat at times as far as dialogue but even then I never expect much from these types of films in that department. As far as the final outcome this is a pretty good film but it just felt like it could have been epic. A story like this begs for an epic story with an epic outcome, this just seemed like a good story with a good outcome. I just feel like it could have been so much more.<br /><br />As far as the acting every one is solid and seemed like they had a great time making this, I know I would. Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock does a good job on this film but you can see that he gets better with each film but he does a good job on this. Steven Brand is really good as king Memnon as he seems to have had a lot of fun with this character. Same can be said for Michael Clarke Duncan who plays Balthazar the leader of a tribe full of female warriors [lucky him]. Kelly Hu is super fine in this film as Cassandra the sorceress and does a good job with her performance. Bernard Hill as Philos does a great job in this as well in this film, love them explosives. But it is Grant Heslov who I find to be the most amusing in this film as Arpid, don't know what it is but I am a sucker for comic relief.<br /><br />This movie is an enjoyable one but this is not the classic it could have been but at least it is better than most of the things out there. As far as The Rock's first starring film he did a good job and you could see back then that we was on his way to becoming a star. And for those wondering or if you do not know this is a WWE or at the time WWF film, Vince McMahon is an executive producer on this film. This is a fun movie that I would recommend to lovers of action flicks or people who like these back in the day films like Conan.</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>Dwayne Johnson plays a natural-born hero called Mathayus... He starts off as an Akkadian mercenary crossing the ancient lands looking for his brother who is slain before his blazing eyes by a Nordic barbarian horde whose name is Memnon...<br /><br />What has kept the vicious tyrant as the absolute conqueror of the land is the fact that he has a visionary sorceress by his side who knows when he should attack his enemies... Mathayus finds out that she's a sexy gorgeous woman who looks amazingly beautiful (Surely the audience is teased ceaselessly by her cleavage-revealing...).

There are common places and stereotypes like the smart young boy and the unerring and opportunistic "fool", the beauty protagonist, the brutal villain. There are also, marvellous action sequences - specially the great explosive final - that makes it worth to watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K0UT3GA4QQG5.html">A1K0UT3GA4QQG5</a><br/><p>It has violence, more than action.

However, our era's special effects makes this movie work wonderfully.  Story is pretty good.  There are some bumps in the telling of the story, but it all evens out.  Good action sequences. Some of the characters you wish were smarter, but overall good job.  I have watched it several times and will again in the future.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>With the gigantic success of "The Mummy", Universal Studios and director Stephen Sommers believed that they had a budding franchise on their hands.  With both the movie studio and the director wishing to see this possible franchise come to fruition, little time was wasted in getting Stephen Sommers busy at work on crafting the sequel.  With a bigger budget, an already established backstory for most of the characters, and the entire cast returning, things were definitely looking good for an even bigger box office return for this sequel.<br /><br />Set in 1933, "The Mummy Returns" takes place approximately 10 years after the events of "The Mummy".  Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Rachel Weisz) are now married and have a young son named Alex.  After a devasting chain of events leads to the resurrection of Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) in London, before they realize what's going on Rick and Evie find themselves in a fight against an army of mummies, and their son ends up getting kidnapped by Imhotep.  Now that Imhotep once again walks the Earth, determined to fulfill his quest for immortality, another force has been loosed upon the world... one born of the darkest rituals of ancient Egyptian mysticism, and even more powerful than Imhotep.  With the fate of the world in the balance, Rick and Evie must race against time to save not only the world but also rescue their son from Imhotep before it's too late.<br /><br />As I stated earlier, this film received an even bigger budget, and had the fortune of getting the entire cast back together, "The Mummy Returns" succeeds in being even bigger, more extravagant, and better than the original film.  With the backstory for the majority of the characters out of the way in "The Mummy", director/writer Stephen Sommers was allowed more freedom in exploring more of the world of this franchise without having to get bogged down on origins.  An interesting segment in the movie happens at the beginning of the film when WWE's Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson makes an appearance as 'The Scorpion King' (the public liked the character so much that Universal spawned him off into his own feature film) in an epic battle that is awesome to watch.  The special effects provided by ILM are once again top-notch, all except for the final sequence with a digital hybrid of 'The Rock' and a CGI scorpion, this scene looked a bit weak on screen.  However, it's forgiveable since this would be an extremely difficult sequence to create, and with that ILM still manages to make the scene appear decent.  The only other complaint I have regarding this movie would have to be that the movie seemed to focus a little too much on the 8-year old son Alex, his character is way too annoying and he's always present since he is partly responsible for the events in this movie.  Aside from those complaints the rest of the movie is really enjoyable, and a very strong sequel to "The Mummy".<br /><br />I strongly recommend seeing this movie, but to fully enjoy the movie make sure you have seen the original film first.<br /><br />"The Mummy Returns" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sensuality.</p></br><a href="../users/AOVJYIUATQKR5.html">AOVJYIUATQKR5</a><br/><p>The sword fights, the "save my wife" the addition of a kid to the cast make this a family favorite for the adults, my sons and my daughters. I am constantly in search of movies that i can share with my whole family.  This one qualifies.

The much awaited sequel-some of the fan sites were abuzz from the moment the decision to make it was even rumored-attempted to cater to the interests of almost everyone, dissolving into a bland tale whose only claim on the viewer's attention was its complexity.  The film was overly serious and melodramatic.  The theme of reincarnation seemed to have been introduced to salvage an otherwise rather banal plot.  It also allowed for the introduction of some wonderful period scenes with colorful costumes and the only interesting  martial arts activity in the film (though not necessarily good-those in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon are infinitely better).  The film relies heavily on CGI, but other than the splendid recreations of Ancient Egypt most of the computer work is trite, consisting of little toothy monsters and the return of the skeleton army.<p>Again the history is atrocious.  Seti I was not stabbed to death.  The Egyptian museum possesses his mummy among the collection of its royal mummies, so that's definite.  Nefertiri was the  first and favorite of his Queens (her tomb is among the most beautiful and elaborate in the Valley of the Queens near Luxor) and not his daughter.  Imhotep is an Old Kingdom architect, and the Scorpion King is an early pre-dynastic king.  Ahkhsunamon was the heiress to the Thutmosid dynasty (the XVIIIth not the XIXth) one of the six daughters of Akhenaton and Nefertiti, and the wife of Tutankhamon (remember him?).  Etc, etc, etc.  It's unfortunate, since the errors in the first film could have provided the plot to the second; all Summers had to do was figure out plausible explanations for some of them-the movement of the pyramids from Cairo to Luxor being one of the few that would be difficult to explain away short of extraterrestrials.  I did it in my spare moments at work-few enough in ICU-and came up with a wonderful,  historic, internally consistent plot.  Certainly Summers has more imagination than I do!<p>Although most of the central characters reappeared and were played by the same actors, they had been transmogrified to such an extent that only their names and faces remained the same!  With the single exception of Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bay, most of the characters did more morphing than the mummy himself.  O'Connell, for instance, has become a mere shadow of himself.  Marriage seems to have robbed him of the last shreds of his sense of the absurd, and even when he is at his best, when dealing with his erstwhile buddy Izzy Buttons (Shaun Parkes), the latter steals every scene they're in together.  Rick's almost frenetic activity in the first film and his sharp as tacks wit are missing and missed in the second.  Maybe it's an advertisement against the unhealthiness of matrimony for males!<p>The individuals who were most disappointingly out of character were the two central women, Evie and Ankhsunamun.  The former has lost the ditzy, accident prone intellectual aura that lent her such charm in the first movie.  The Evie of the first film was a woman one might well see someone like O'Connell taking risks to rescue, a bright person whose brash naivete might both exasperate and attract.  The Evie of the Mummy Returns has an edge.  She's sexual rather than sexy, and she's definitely not funny.  Where is the wonderful woman who proudly, if drunkenly, states "I am a librarian!" and passes out mid-kiss, collapsing face first into the sand.<p>Of all the characters, Ankhsunamon's change is the most disappointing.  Here is a woman who sacrifices her very life for her lover in the first film, certain that his own love and devotion will do whatever it takes to resurrect her if he can.  In the first movie he nearly succeeds.  In the second, she has somehow managed to be reincarnated and attempts to bring him back from the dead for little other reason than to achieve power.  She is no longer the almost feline creature who exudes strong sexual allure that she was in the first film.  Instead of a seductress, she's now a, harsh looking Vogue model type, like a harden femme fatal out of a Dashiell Hammett murder mystery.  Her motives seem less certain, her devotion to her lover less apparent, and her courage more in doubt.  Her recoil in the face of danger seems merely a literary  contrivance, a foil to Evie's unfailing allegiance to Rick.  <p>Subverting his part as title character in order to bring in fans of the professional wrestling stars, Imhotep goes from a man with a mission to a man with feet of clay by the end of the story.  He becomes a foil for the new focus of the film, The Rock.  This is a great disappointment, since his character's problems are central to the movement of the whole story, even the whole series.  When both Rick and Imhotep were confronted with the evil of the Scorpion King, one almost expected them to work together to defeat him, perhaps deferring their own conflict to a latter episode.  Instead Summers merely chooses to make the issue a contrast between a couple devoted to one another by virtue of love and one devoted to power alone. <p>Oded Fehr, whose character Ardeth Bay delighted the audience of the first movie, embellishes the film more often, but his appearances seem more ornamental than purposeful, a sop to the millions of fans who enjoyed him in the first film.  Surely more could have been done with his character.<p>Probably the most delightful pair of characters were Rick and Evie's son, Alex, and his arch enemy the towering black henchman assigned as his jailer.  The two were perfect foils for one another, and by the end one almost hoped that the latter would change teams, for whatever self-seeking purposes, and save the boy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>As the finale of this movie shows. Evie rescues Rick, but Patricia Velasquez's resurrection of Anck Su Namun runs away from her 'true love', Imhotep.<br /><br />Brendan Fraser & Rachel Weiz are back once more, with their characters bratty little son, Alex (Freddie Boath). Arnold Vosloo is also brought back, with a much bigger role this time, and for the guys, Patricia Velasquez is back as Meela Nais, the reincarnation of Anck Su Namun. The designs on Anuk Su Namun's sleeves on her dress look exactly like her body paint in her previous life. John Hannah & Oded Fehr return as Jonathan & Ardeth Bey respectively.<br /><br />Who are the cast joined by this time? The one, the only, Dwayne Johnson, otherwise known as The Rock, for all you wrestling fans. He shone so much in the TWO scenes, Stephen Sommers promptly gave him his own movie.<br /><br />There's a lot of similarities between the first movie and this movie. When Alex is reading from the Book of the Dead, he has trouble translating a hieroglyph of a stork. His Uncle Jonathan  reminds Alex what the symbol means. In the original, Jonathan needed help from Evie translating the same symbol. The dialogue is almost exactly the same as the first film, and in both movies, the person helping the translator with the last word, is fighting with Anck-su-namun while they speak (Evie in the first film, and Jonathan in the second). Also, the title does not appear at the beginning of this film. The title finally is given at the end of the picture, after the headlining credits but before main credits roll. (That's why I love this film: I can't stand fast-forwarding through loads of credits to start watching the movie) Alex knocks over the columns in the same way his mother knocked over the bookcases in the original.<br /><br />In this, Evie realises she's been reincarnated, and she was around at the same time as Imhotep - what a coincidence! And she & Anck Su Namun also knew each other. Another coincidence. It's actually very good how they managed to work this out, despite my sarcasm. For the guys, you also get to see both girls fighting - woooo. Evie was called Nerfertiri but originally was supposed to be called Nefertiti but the producers felt that people would make (...) jokes about the name so it was changed to that of another Egyptian queen.<br /><br />There seemed to be a lot of pain in this movie: Brendan gets very much beaten up throughout - he tore a spinal disk, cracked a rib, and injured his knees during production. Dwayne Johnson suffered from food poisoning and sunstroke. (Ha!)<br /><br />This is a great movie, a fantastic sequel. There are rumours going about there's going to be a Mummy 3, without Imhotep and Anck Su Namun. It could happen, although it could be a little boring to reincarnate Imhotep 3 times, and Anck Su Namun twice. Imhotep could come back to life as king of hell as he fell down to the gate of hell. And Anck Su Namun could come back as Scropion Queen, as she was bitten alive by insects. If you liked both these films, you'll probably enjoy Scorpion King, although it seems pointless to give a guy who was in TWO scenes (hey, and he was CGI in the second scene!) his own movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1655SGPPUUCRP.html">A1655SGPPUUCRP</a><br/><p>I went into "The Scorpion King" with pretty low expectations.  Being a lover of the first two "Mummy" films, I was terribly disappointed, like many, to learn that the next film in the series would be a prequel and not involve the usual charming cast of Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz.  I also went in expecting The Rock to be boring, cheesy, and annoying.  It seemed to me that "The Scorpion King" would serve one purpose, to show off The Rock's fighting ability (like we don't know already).<p>Boy was I wrong!  "The Scorpion King" turned out to be a top quality action flick!  It was funny and filled with plenty of the witty humor that made "The Mummy" and "The Mummy Returns" such enjoyable films.  The story was actually quite exciting and involving, quite the opposite of what I expected!<p>Believe it or not, The Rock was oddly charming in his role as Mathayus, The Scorpion King.  I actually ended up really loving him!  Mathayus's jittery sidekick, Arpid (Grant Heslov) steals the show!  Heslov is so charming and utterly hilarious, it's almost as if he was made for this role!  My only complaint as far as acting goes is that of Kelly Hu, who plays the sorceress (and Mathayus's love interest).  Her lines were cheesy to begin with, but an actress of greater talent could've delivered them with more enthusiasm and character.  <p>The movie begins rather unimpressively with Mathayus rescuing his brother from some barbaric enemies.  The fight sequence was fantastic, but what really turned me off about this scene (and made me question how good the rest of the film would be) was when Mathayus came barreling in to save his brother with his bow in hand and said "Boo" and everyone started screaming.  Come on; how cheesy and clich&eacute;d is that line?  Thank God the rest of the movie isn't like that!<p>Here's a quick summarization of the plot:<p>Mathayus is hired by a band of rebels to murder the wizard who is helping the evil Memnon win battles by seeing into the future for him.  Mathayus is set on completing his mission until he sees the wizard, who is actually the beautiful witch Cassandra.  Because of Mathayus's hesitation, Memnon's guards capture him and are about to kill him when Cassandra announces that she has had a vision and he is not to die by "Memnon's hand or any that he orders".  Yeah, right.  The movie takes off from there.<p>Yes, this movie is dumb and ridiculous, but it somehow manages to rise above that to bring us a truly enjoyable film.<p>"The Scorpion King" is short but sweet, running at a convenient 90 minutes.<p>Rated PG-13 for "intense sequences of action violence and some sensuality".  Would be acceptable for around 10 and up.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HS9F7J51E9CB.html">A1HS9F7J51E9CB</a><br/><p>I went into this movie cold.  I had no idea who "The Rock" was (I'd read about him, but somehow did not connect him with this film) I did not know "The Scorpion King" was supposed to be a prequel of the Mummy movies, neither of which I had seen.  So me and my popcorn had a clear, unbiased mind.<p>The setting is long, long ago.  Gommorah is still in business and gunpowder has yet to be invented.  Arkkadian Assassin Mathayus (the Rock) has been hired to kill a sorcerer whose predictions are far too dependable. Mathayus' brother is tortured to death, and he vows revenge. When he discovers the sorcerer is a gorgeous young lady in a harem costume, he "liberates" her.  His steed is a camel, the odds against him are never less than 50 to 1, and he lays them out like dominoes. After 90 minutes of mayhem, the good guys win the kingdom, the castle and the babe.<p>Dwayne Johnson was a charmer in this potboiler.  He has almost too good a sense of humor (I thought he was going to crack up a few times over his ridiculous lines. Shades of Crosby and Hope in a "Road" picture!) His face is expressive, his movements agile, and he is definitely eye candy.  I wish him well in a movie career.  I think he would be a fine action hero.  I felt sorry for his sidekick, Philos (Bernard Hill).  The script was so bad that the feeble jokes he was forced to utter wouldn't get a giggle out of a pre-schooler.  With the exception of a few reprehensible villains and mighty Balthazar (Michael Clarke Duncan), the cast was uniformly beautiful right down to the starving children. <p>The action is non-stop, so time passes quickly and all in all, I had a good time. "The Scorpion King" makes a good non-think rental.  Laugh along with The Rock.<br />-sweetmolly-Amazon.com Reviewer</p></br><a href="../users/A1K94LXX833JTT.html">A1K94LXX833JTT</a><br/><p>The upcoming release of The Mummy: Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor has prompted Universal to release new DVD editions of The Mummy and The Mummy Returns.  This new Deluxe Edition of The Mummy Returns includes most of the special features from the 2001 Collector's Edition, plus some new features.  It will only be available in widescreen format.<br /><br />The Mummy left most professional reviewers cool to lukewarm at best, and this, the first sequel, left them cold.  But audiences still enjoyed it.  Like the first in the series, it's a big-budget, big-special-effects horror/adventure extravaganza with George of the Jungle playing an Indiana Jones-type character.  Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz reprise their roles, he the adventurer and she the Egyptologist, married to each other with a young son in 1933.  The same evil mummy-being-thing that bothered them so much in the first film is back, and this time there's an even more terrible force bent on destroying everything.  The plot isn't very strong, but there is an army of pygmy mummies.  Silly fun, sometimes more silly than fun.<br /><br />These are the new special features:<br /><br />-- "An Army To Rule The World Part 2" featurette<br />-- a digital copy of the movie<br />-- "Unraveling The Legacy Of The Mummy" featurette (also in the new The Mummy Deluxe Edition)<br />-- a sneak peak at The Mummy: Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor (also in the new The Mummy Deluxe Edition)<br /><br />Carried over from the 2001 Collector's Edition:<br /><br />-- audio commentary with director/writer Stephen Sommers and executive producer/editor Bob Ducsay<br />-- "Visual And Special Effects Formation," on how the special effects were done<br />-- "Spotlight on Location," a behind-the-scenes featurette<br />-- a conversation with The Rock, you know, the wrestler/actor, who speaks, about The Scorpion King movie<br />-- Live's "Forever May Not Be Long Enough" music video<br />-- "Egyptology 201," text on Egyptian history<br /><br />The only feature from the Collector's Edition not announced for the new Deluxe Edition that anyone is likely to miss is a few minutes of outtakes/bloopers.  (I wouldn't be surprised to see them show up as an "easter egg" (hidden feature).)<br /><br />The page for The Mummy Deluxe Edition is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018BD9FI">here</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a razzle, dazzle, knock you out of your seat with special effects, kind of movie. It is non-stop entertainment, and a worthy sequel to its predecessor, "The Mummy". Even though the plot is thin, and character development is almost non-existent, I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />Archaeologists Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Rachel Weisz) have tied the knot since the original movie and have an eight year old son, Alex, adorably played by Freddie Boath. While on an archaeological dig in Egypt, they recover a special, golden bracelet which conveys special powers to the person who wears it. Alex, not knowing this, puts on the bracelet which had, at one time, belonged to the Scorpio King, played by wrestler, The Rock.<br /><br />Evie's brother (John Hannah deliciously reprises his original role) is mistaken for Rick, as mysterious emissaries try to kill him in an attempt to recover the bracelet on behalf of the evil Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo reprising his original role). As Evie and Rick continue to do battle against these evil, murderous emissaries, the mysterious and devastatingly attractive, Medjai warrior, Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr also reprising his original role), joins them in their battle against evil.<br /><br />In this sequel, past and present collide, and reincarnation adds its own interesting, little twist to the plot. For my money, Oded Fehr walks away with the movie, as Ardeth Bay is such a compelling character: sexy, swashbuckling, and mystical, all rolled into one. He is definitely my favorite character. I hope that we will see even more of him in the next sequel. (Who are we kidding? Of course, there will be another sequel!)<br /><br />The only negative thing that I have to say about the movie has to do with the animation of the Scorpion King at the end. It is too cartoonish. I found it jarring and distracting, as it did not seem to fit with the other graphics used throughout the movie which were great. It made me give the movie four stars, rather than the five I would probably have given, had this concept not been so annoying. It was unnecessary to have this cheesy looking animation, as it detracted from the movie and downgraded its overall quality.<br /><br />Still, see this movie. It is escapism at its best, as well as pure entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QQHIY23PL7H3.html">A2QQHIY23PL7H3</a><br/><p>This set contains reprints of the two recent Mummy films starring Brendan Frasier and also The Scorpion King, notable as The Rock's first starring vehicle. Universal has not added anything new to these discs - in fact, we get the single-disc version of "The Mummy" here and not the ultimate two-disc edition (though to be fair, all it added was cast commentaries and previews for Mummy 2). If you own these films already, this product isn't aimed towards you.<br /><br />These movies are pure popcorn entertainment. The first works reasonably well as an Indiana Jones homage, and is the strongest of the three. The Mummy Returns brings all the main cast back and adds more, resulting in a very crammed movie that relies too heavily on CG effects, many of which are below par. The Scorpion King is like all of The Rock's other movies - brainless, but charming because The Rock is charming.<br /><br />Overall it's hard to recommend a set like this because popcorn flicks don't appeal to everyone. But to be fair, they're the kind of popcorn flicks that know exactly what they are and don't try to be epic, serious, or overly pretentious. This is also a very cheap set, making it a nice consideration if you like even one of the flicks.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this movie. I've read some of the other reviews here, and some people have criticized the movie for being overly cliched and predictable. No doubt some people will say that the movie serves up its hunk of beefcake in all-too-predictable a fashion (don't you hate smart-assed reviewers who take themselves all too seriously?). But come on folks, this sort of action-packed thriller isn't meant to be analyzed or dissected in too much detail--it's meant to be fun, mindless entertainment--and in that regard, it succeeds very well. I was also pleasantly surprised to find The Rock (pro-wrestler Dwayne Johnson) has considerable on-screen presence, as he goes around offing bad guys right and left.<p>Not that The Rock has to carry the whole movie on his own considerable shoulders. The bad-guy king (Steven Brand) who The Rock is sent to assasinate and his sorceress (Kelly Hu) are also good in their roles, as is The Rock's sidekick (unfortunately I don't know the actor's name) who provides some comic relief, much in the same way that R2D2 and C3PO did in the first Star Wars movie (actually Lucas got the idea for the comic pair from one of Kurosawa's movies). <p>The swordplay and fight scenes are top-notch. And speaking of swordplay, big guy Michael Clarke Duncan also has an important role as the Nubian king, and his fight with the Rock is one of the climaxes of the movie, as he almost beats The Rock in a dramatic mano-a-mano sword battle. I'm not sure there were black Nubians, who were well-known in Roman times after the emperor Octavian conquered North Africa, living in Sumeria in 4000 BC,  when the Akkadians lived in ancient Sumeria, but as I said, I don't really analyze movies like this too much. It gets in the way of the fun.<p>I don't know what ancient Akkadian or Sumerian sets would look like, either, but these seemed pretty realistic to me and added to the movie's overall ambience. (I'm sure King Sargon of Akkad would have approved even if they weren't--after all, the Akkadians haven't gotten much play in about 4000 years).  This sort of action movie plays very well on the Big Screen, and I'm sure I enjoyed seeing it more in a theater as opposed to seeing it on TV. <p>All in all, a fun way to spend a Sat. or Sun. afternoon or evening. Big Steve says goes see it and don't "Bogart" the popcorn.</p></br><a href="../users/AHCVWPLA1O4X8.html">AHCVWPLA1O4X8</a><br/><p>The Scorpion King is a spinoff of the Mummy and the Mummy returns movies.  It stars the Rock as Matthias, an assassin for hire who has a personal score to settle with the typical bad guy.  Along the way there's the girl, the comic sidekick, the rival turned ally, the climactic final battle...well, you get the picture.<p>Okay, so there's nothing that original here, but the Rock actually does a pretty good job of acting.  Also, there's his buddy Balthazar, played by Michael Clark Duncan (you know, that REALLY big guy from Armageddon and The Green Mile).  Besides the acting, the special effects are really cool, and the fight scenes are very exciting.  <p>The downside is simply that it's nothing new.  It's all been done before, but hey, we won't hold that against the Rock.  All in all, it's a movie worth seeing, but maybe not worth owning.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FEQXNCFC68KC.html">A3FEQXNCFC68KC</a><br/><p>This is essentially the same generic all flash with little substance kind of action movie I&#8217;m starting to come to expect from Stephen Sommers. Though he only wrote this one it seems the same derivative Hollywood stylings there. While admittedly this movie has tons of high flying action, The Scorpion King brings hardly anything else to the table. Add to that the various cheesy details thrown in for good measure and you have an utterly mediocre film.<br /><br />The plot is your standard revenge on your brother&#8217;s killer while saving everybody around you in the process kind of fare. While technically there is  no problem with this kind of plot the movie fails to do anything to make their version stand out. Apparently all those action scenes are at the expense of the story. Wait until you find out why they call this guy Scorpion King. Has to be the dumbest thing I ever heard and it&#8217;s put in almost as an afterthought. The blood of scorpions flows in your veins&#8230; BAH! The supporting characters are almost completely disposable and the main characters lack any real depth or development. What&#8217;s with the goofy inventor and comedy relief? Basically the storyline just sits there and is only a vehicle for the incessant action.<br /><br />And I do mean incessant action. While some of the action scenes are pretty cool and all you just can&#8217;t escape the action. EVERY single scene in this movie has action in it. There is no change in the movie&#8217;s pacing and there is no room any plot or character development because of it. To make matters that much worse the sound effects are over the top along with the rest of the special effects. I mean if I hear another squishing noise every time The Rock stabs someone I&#8217;m going to scream. There are some cheesy flashy effects on this movie like flaming swords, bad CG effects and explosions (especially when there shouldn&#8217;t be any explosions). Top it all off with the occasional rock music mismatch and there is hardly any decent production values in this movie at all.<br /><br />Still if you like non-stop action and don&#8217;t care that much for substance behind it then this is one great flick. If derivative themes and cheesy special effects bug you then I guess you&#8217;ll have to make a judgment call on whether or not you can accept the movie&#8217;s popcorn simplicity over the cheese. Ultimately if you don&#8217;t take this movie seriously&#8230; and I really mean not seriously at all&#8230; then The Scorpion King might be a decent getaway from reality.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FZA9C5MVIWHE.html">A1FZA9C5MVIWHE</a><br/><p>this is the first performance in the mummy series movies with the rock of the WWE. in 2001, they had a preview of the movie on the WWE with goldust and booker t critiquing it. i thought the critique they did was pretty hilarious. this movie has non-stop action throughout. you want pretty ladies? feast your eyes on rachel weisz. there is plenty of special effects throughout this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>Awesome movie!

I really wanted to, and still do want to try to like this movie. There were three major stories going on this movie, as well as the little side plot with the o'conells son wearing the bracelet of anubis. Now one question, If Evey is Nefertiti reincarnated. Why wasn't that even mentioned slightly in the first movie, I did like the involvement of the Scorpion king. And actually wished he had been the main bad guy of this movie, instead we get imhotep again. Now Arnold Vosloo did an incredible job as Imhotep in the first one, but you stripped him of his powers and shoved him the "pool" and buried him beneath humanaptra. Basically killing him off, but nooooooooooooo, lets bring back his reincarnated girlfriend. She digs him up, but wait, evey's been having strange dreams. Oh I forgot the 4th major story, Rick is a Madji. That's right, he's a warrior for God, as said by Ardeth Bay. Yep, we get a fight at the end between the scorpion king Imhotep, and Rick. Wait... evey's been killed but Her son brings her back to life, with the help of Johnathan, in a replica scene of the ending to the first movie. Well never fear, Rick does kill the scorpion king. Sending him to hell along with Anubis's army, Oh. Halfway through the movie, Ardeth Bay tells rick. That he is a madji, and to prove it, Tells Evey that she's Nefertiti reincarnated, and that Rick is a Reincarnated protector of sorts. Yeeeeeeeeeah, they should've just stuck with the Scorpion King. They still could have had the Mummy pygmies which are hilarious, and Rick could've battled the Scorpion King and won. Too much going on, with villains that should have been left dead. A decent movie, yes I own it, but only for the collections sake. Could've been better.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ARJ16772TKHT.html">A3ARJ16772TKHT</a><br/><p>This one has very much the same feel as the first one, which is great. It's a very good follow-up to the first movie without feeling like they're retreading the same ground the whole time.<br />At the end, when Dwayne Johnson's character appears, there is a bit of a problem since CG human faces are still rather hard today, but definitely imperfect back in 2001, but on the whole, the special effects don't distract and do their job quite well. The characters are charming enough and the action fun and frenetic enough that you can forgive a little slip-up in the special effects from time to time.<br />A good watch and a fun movie.<br />[slight spoiler]<br />I do find it a little forced that they decided to make Evy the reincarnation of an ancient Egyptian princess. Largely I think they were trying to find a way to give her character more importance in the story. I don't have a problem with wanting to do that, but this reincarnation thing just felt a little kludged. Not so much, however, to make the movie unenjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>The Mummy Returns is an awesome movie. and it brings the start to The Scorpion King. this is an awesome Movie. I Recommend This Movie For Everyone.

Again, we have people (though this time intentionally though, besides to raise the Army of Anubis, why they really want him to kill the Scorpion King, except for the reincarnated Anck-su-namun, is never explained). And again, he must suck the life out the people who opened his chest, though again intentionally compared to the first film and it isn't as long and drawn out. Though I must say, in the end, I feel a little sympathy for Imhotep as his love, the only reason for him to live, abandons him. Kudos to Arnold Vosloo for that little moment. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are back again as well and still have an amazing chemistry (which you can tell when Evelyn dies and Rick is heartbroken over it). This time, they're married and have a son named Alex, whose not as annoying as some of the other kids in movies I've reviewed. Must be something about the new millenium that all of a sudden, kids can act. John Hannah is also back and is still the comedic relief but the character comes into his own I think when he fights Anck-su-namun for his sister and recreates the scene from the first film while Alex reads from the Book of the Dead. Oded Fehr and Patricia Vel&aacute;squez also return from the first film though I find Vel&aacute;squez' character a little annoying at times though she is a legitimate threat towards her enemies and then loving towards Imhotep (until the end), so the actress really knows how to switch emotions when called for (unlike some actresses I could name). The action sequences are executed really well. The double-decker chase/fight, the pygmies (a scary yet funny scene at the same time) and the fight with Anubis' army being my favorite sequences as you can hardly tell that CGI is going on. The music is also handled really well, I think even better than the first film, with the rousing action cue being my favorite.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>The Mummy Returns (Widescreen Collector's Edition) is an entertaining blockbuster that is thin on plot and charachter development but heavy on special effects, one liners and many many action scenes. Do not expect great acting or a plot that remotely makes sense since if you do then you will be very disapointed since it has neither. I expected an actionpacked popcorn movie and this is what I got. 4/5.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>Brendan Fraser heads up the cast of two of the three films in "The Mummy Collector's Set."  It's a nice compilation of the first two "Mummy" flicks and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's vehicle, "The Scorpion King."  Odds are that if you've watched these films and enjoyed them, this is a great boxed set for you to pick up.  A newer set was released this year, which includes the first two "Mummy" films and the latest installment of the series, "Tomb of the Dragon Emperor."  "The Scorpion King" is not included in that set, but can be purchased on its own (as can all four of these films).<br /><br />The first two films are similar, with the Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) being raised from the dead and hoping to bring back is lost love in the first film (and unleashing plagues on the world) and his lost love attempting to bring him back (as well as the Scorpion King) to take over the world.  In their way in both films is Rick O'Connell (Fraser), Evelyn and Jonathan (Rachel Weisz, John Hannah) and Ardeth Bay (the underused Oded Fehr).<br /><br />The third film, "The Scorpion King," is a pure action/popcorn flick littered with comedy in the same vein as "Hercules:  The Legendary Journeys."  Dwayne Johnson and Michael Clarke Duncan lead this film that is something of a prequel to the other films.  You do not need to watch this film in order to understand anything going on in the other two and vice versa.  This film stands apart as its own entity.<br /><br />Special features range from outtakes and deleted scenes to a couple of brief documentaries on Egyptology.  There are also a couple of music videos and a look at the "real" Scorpion King.<br /><br />If you're in the mood for big action, big effects and big bad guys, pick up "The Mummy Collector's Set."  I also recommend "Tomb of the Dragon Emperor."  The only shortfall of that film is the fact that Weisz did not reprise her role in it.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Region A, B, C<br />Format: Blu-ray<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />VC-1 BD-50<br />Running time: 2:09:38<br />Movie size: 31,31 GB<br />Disc size: 36,03 GB<br />Average video bit rate: 23.07 Mbps<br /><br />Main video: VC-1 / 23.07 Mbps 1080p / 23.976fps / Advanced Profile 3<br />PiP video: VC-1 /  744 kbps 480p / 23.976fps / Advanced Profile 2<br /><br />DTS-HD Master Audio  English  4553 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 4553kbps (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 1536kbps)<br />DTS Audio  French  768 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 768kbps<br />DTS Audio  Spanish  768 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 768kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48kHz / 192kbps<br />DTS-HD Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48kHz / 192kbps<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH / French / Spanish<br />Number of chapters: 21<br /><br />#Audio Commentary<br />#Featurette: "Spotlight on Location"  (SD, 20 minutes)<br />#"Visual and Special Effects Formation" Vignettes  (SD, 20 minutes)<br />#Outtake Reel  (SD, 5 minutes)<br />#Music Video (SD)<br />#Picture-in-Picture - U-Control<br />#'The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor" Sneak Preview (SD)</p></br><a href="../users/A1U360OMVQRPUB.html">A1U360OMVQRPUB</a><br/><p>King Memnon-with the aid of his sorceress, Cassandra, who has the ability to foretell the future-steadily conquers the world of southern Egypt in 3000 BC.  Defeated and driven before him, the various tribes and smaller nations face imminent extinction or subjugation before the ferocious army Memnon controls.  Every day brings more bloodthirsty warriors to fight under Memnon's standard.  In a last-chance bid to stand against the cruel king, one of the tribal elders hires a trio of the last Akkadian mercenary warriors.  For the blood price offered, the Akkadians agree to steal into Memnon's city and assassinate the king's sorceress.  Getting into the city is dangerous work, but Mathayus and his companions manage-only to be betrayed.  Just as Memnon is about to put Mathayus to death, the sorceress interrupts.  She says that Mathayus can't be killed by the king's hand or one of his men.  Instead, Mathayus ends up staked out in the desert, up to his jaw in sand as dreaded fire ants are riled from their holes.  Knowing the fire ants will kill him and eat the flesh from his bones, Mathayus makes a deal with a horse thief to free him.  Once loose, Mathayus returns to Memnon's city ready to wreak unholy vengeance.  However, fate conspires against the Akkadian warrior, and before he can take down Memnon, he must find and raise an army of his own.<p>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is a legend among WWF fans, but he's also starred in THE MUMMY RETURNS, setting up the role he plays in THE SCORPION KING.  The Rock has also made guest appearances on STAR TREK: VOYAGER, THAT `70S SHOW, and THE NET.  Michael Clark Duncan got an award nomination for his stint as John Coffey in THE GREEN MILE, but got his start bodyguarding stars and musicians.  He's also been in PLANET OF THE APES and ARMAGEDDON, and has the role of the Kingpin in the upcoming DAREDEVIL movie.  Versed in the martial arts, Kelly Hu got her start as Melia in GROWING PAINS, then had roles in FRIDAY THE 13th PART VIII: JASON TAKES MANHATTAN, THE DOORS, then recurring roles on NASH BRIDGES and MARTIAL LAW, and has a role in the upcoming X-MEN 2.<p>As an action-adventure flick goes, THE SCORPION KING sings with violence, amazing fight choreography, and splendor that would rival an Old Hollywood period piece.  The Rock comes across very believably as Mathayus, one of the last Akkadian mercenary warriors, and a solid romantic lead.  His swordplay gleams and flashes, and his hand-to-hand combat are top-notch from all the WWF battles he's had.  The opening montage of action to set the movie into play is a blistering riff of everything the viewer has in store.  Kelly Hu, barely dressed throughout the movie, is simply gorgeous and carries her role as Cassandra easily, layering her performances in so that she underscores the action and the emotion.  Grant Heslov-playing Arpid, a horse-thief-steals the show upon occasion much as did Kevin J. O'Connor in THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS.  The pacing of the movie remains frenetic throughout, driving the viewer from one incredible scene to another.  Filmed entirely on location in California and in sound stages at Universal Studios in Burbank, THE SCORPION KING is a feast for the eyes, holding settings that look like they were only recently uncovered from the desert.  The final battle between hero and villain is awesome, captivating with intensity, and fraught with some real peril (The Rock actually had his eyebrows singed when the flaming swords got too close to him, as revealed in the DVD features).<p>Well done as the movie is, there were a couple of spots that needed better editing.  Viewers never find out how Arpid escaped from the sand when he was buried up to his neck, and during the climb up the side of the building in Chapter 16, the wire-walking was entirely too obvious because the Rock's body remained too far out.  It would have been nice to see Kelly Hu kick (literally) loose with the martial arts she made look so good in MARTIAL LAW.  Also missing from the story (although it was deliberately done, according to director Chuck Russell), is a supernatural overtone.  Magic actually played a very small part in the overall scheme of things. <p>THE SCORPION KING is an absolute must for the action-adventure fan, as well as people who loved the first two MUMMY movies starring Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz.  Anyone looking for a solid popcorn movie, a no-brainer that has action, thrills, and a good-natured sense of itself, can slip this DVD into the player and enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E975KR2HRERX.html">A3E975KR2HRERX</a><br/><p>But Universal did at the very least included DTS! to this Blu-ray! as well as the first movie.<br /><br />By the way, this movie on the whole. Was not very good and was a bit way too campy.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Sequels are tough to do because you know what to expect so filmmaker's often have to give you that plus something unexpected. Bigger and better may not always translate to better but it often translates to a sequel that is the equal of the film that spawned it. I'm going to assume that you've seen it (if not there's a critical bit at the end of this along with a plot synposis that is as sketchy as possible so as not to spoil the experience of the film) and focus on why you should buy the upgraded Blu-ray. As good as "The Mummy Returns" looks on DVD, the Blu-ray is even better looking. Colors are bolder and there's signficantly more detail but, more important, the dark scenes look much better here. The lossless audio sounds terrific as well and will put you right in the middle of the action.<br /><br />You should be aware however that Edge Enhancement is more noticeable in the BR than it was in the HD-DVD disc or the DVD and there is a fair amount of digital noise reduction applied to reduce grain in certain scenes. What does that mean? It means that we do lose some detail.<br /><br />Be aware, however, that the extras are in 480p and NOT in HD. Universal does port over U-Control (which was developed for HD-DVD) where you can customize special features on the BD disc. We get all the extras from the original single disc set plus the new extras from the 2 disc DVD ported over to the BD. "The Mummy Returns" is nicely packaged in a colorful slipcase (although I think they could have done without this). At Best Buy and Circuit City (as well as select other retailers there is also movie cash included. You have to go online and register so you can print out your movie ticket (which is good only through 8/24/08 and the site which was up earlier for access to print your ticket now requires you to wait until 8/1/08. I guess some people used their tickets early for other movies or Universal is doing this as a precautionary move).<br /><br />"The Mummy Returns" is less of a scary horror flick than its predecessor and even more like a "Raiders" type of flick. A perfect popcorn movie, Stephen Sommers takes the same ingredients (evil mummy resurrected, adventurers seeking artifacts and fortunes, supernatural powers)and creates a film that is every bit as fun as the first film was. Like "Aliens" relationship with "Alien", "The Mummy Returns" focuses on taking characters we knew from the first film and putting them in a slightly different context this time around.<br /><br />SOME SPOILERS:<br /><br />Rick (Brendan Fraiser)and Evie (Rachel Weisz)now have a 9 year old son Alex(Freddie Boath)and are still digging in dusty old tombs in Egypt. The year of the Scorpion has arrived which means that if Baltus (Alun Armstrong) and the reincarnation of Im-Ho-Tep's (Arnold Vosloo)love Meela-Nais (Patricia Velasquez returning from the first film in a much larger role) can raise Im-Ho-Tep he can take on the Scorpion King (The Rock) Im-Ho-Tep can use the armies of the underworld to rule the world. Alex is taken prisoner and Rick, Evie and Jonathan (John Hannah)Evie's brother must travel to Egypt to help Ardeth Bey (Oded Fehr)stop the creature, get their son and save the world.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L.html">A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L</a><br/><p>The first two movies are very good, in the old fashion Hollywood adventure way that many directors and writers seem to be going for.  The first two DVDs have tons of extras and great commentaries.  The third movie, The Scorpion King, feels more like a corny fantasy film, like the Gor flicks or a porn movie with all the sex removed.  They have tons of extras also but the commentaries are kind of weak.  If you don't have any of the movies I would suggest getting the set.  If you already have the first two DVDs don't bother with this set.  The first two DVDs, as the other reviewers have pointed out, are the same as those released before and I don't think the third DVD is worth getting.  Unless you can get it at a low price.  The third movie, in fact, is why the set has had two points removed.  Overall, there are lots of sexy women and humor, but the third movie just falls flat on its face, even with the charming Rock starring in it.</p></br><a href="../users/A8X8D4BUY5DFU.html">A8X8D4BUY5DFU</a><br/><p>Superb CGI, excellent actors, especially Brendan Fraser,  a very good role for him as a more macho Indiana Jones type character. Humor was subdued but omnipresent.  Horror was not excessively gruesome, even occasionally humorous. An enjoyable series.  The sequels are more action and CGI; less character development, believable plot, and humor. On the whole, above average entertainment. The first is the best for Egyptiologists.</p></br><a href="../users/A28B7IJR80M8KE.html">A28B7IJR80M8KE</a><br/><p>At first I did not care for this, but after watching it again, I have to say I love it, definately a fun summer movie, it is right up there with Indiana Jones as far as thrill rides go, Brendan Fraser's Rick O'Connell could in all reality be a rival to Harrison Ford's Jones, Director Stephen Sommers wanted to out do himself with this sequel, & for the most part he did just that, the film begins with the Scopion King (The Rock) who is out to conquer anyone & everyone, soon he is near death as he makes a last plea to his God for eternity, his wish is soon granted as he becomes immortalized for thousands of years, the film then progresses to 1933, some 8 years after the events of the first film, Rick & Evelyn are now married with an 8 year old son & for the most part living a normal life, they still treasure hunt, but with caution, they soon discover the scorpion King's wrist band that has the power to unleash his wrath upon the world, unknown to them, there are mercenary hunters digging in the City of the Dead, the first film's centerpiece, the tomb of Imetopp is once again brought back to life as he is re-united with his love who has somehow been re-incarnated in the form of another woman who bears a resemblence, when they learn of the Scorpion King's wrist band they go after O'Connell for it, that is when the fun begins, soon O'Connell & Co. are once again on the ride of their lives as 'Connell's son who is wearing the wrist band is kidnapped, Imetopp, determined to acquire the Scorpion King's powers proceeds to follow the path of which the Scorpion King dwells, what follows is one adventure after another, Everyone from the original returns for this one, somthing that is rare in sequels, Arnold Vosloo gives more depth to Imetopp, as does the protector(can't remember his name) Patricia Valesquez is stunning as his re-incarnated lover & Rachel Weisz is equally stunning as Evelyn ... & Brendan Fraser is comical as always as O'Connell, definately a thrill ride if you don't take it so seriously, the locations are stunning to watch, Ancient Egypt is brought to life in a very realistic way, a little contrived, but a winner nonetheless, definately outdoes it's original!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2QQHIY23PL7H3.html">A2QQHIY23PL7H3</a><br/><p>Now THIS is a great popcorn film!! After seeing the trailer on the Ultimate Edition of the original 'Mummy' DVD, I knew this was one summer movie I couldn't pass up. And you know what? I was right. Even detractors of 'The Mummy Returns' will agree: This film packs in more than your money's worth of action, adventure, and special effects. In fact, the film feels very similiar in pacing to 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'. In my opinion, these two rank among the best rollercoaster movies of all time.<p>It's unfair to say that 'The Mummy Returns' has no plot, when really, it has a very interesting, even epic plot. The beginning of the film details the fall of a great warrior called The Scorpion King, and how his resting grounds could unlock an ancient evil that could end the world. Whether or not the mythology is accurate is irrelevant; it's close enough to our romantic images of ancient Egypt, so it'll suffice. Unfortunately, Sommers did very little to explain this complex plot. While the action scenes in the movie are fantastic (I'll praise them later), they force the exposition to be hastily crammed, and mostly given as dialogue by Ardeth Bey. Hey there's so much action that the movie even forgets to show us its title (which we obviously know, but it's a formality that I like). Also, the return of The Mummy and his mistress were unnecessary. While I like Arnold Vosloo and Patricia Velasquez, the story could have been fine without them. Their inclusion adds in another bit of continuity, but with two major villains, both get short-changed on character development.<p>But of course the real meat of the movie is action and special effects, which are here in spades. The movie starts out in a booby-trapped temple, where the O'Connells find a rare artifact. The villains then strike at Connell Manor, where a big fight scene insues. Evie is kidnapped, so the heros storm a local museum to save her, then escape via a double-decker bus while being chased by mummies. And this is only the first hour of the movie!! The sequences are fast, energetic, and backed by an Indidana Jones-worthy score. The huge amounts of CGI work is also worth mentioning. It's not as realistic as ILM's past projects, but I think they weren't trying to go for realism. Plus, George Lucas soaked up the best talent for his Star Wars movies. The only truly bad CGI sequences are the wall of water and the Scorpion King at the end. Everything else looks great. <p>Special mention must be made of Rachel Weisz. If nothing else, buy this film to see her in action!! While she was already a talented actress in the original 'Mummy', nothing in the world prepared me for just how stunningly gorgeous she looks in this one. Her fight scenes are amazingly done, and she'll keep your eyes glued to the screen when the action and effects don't. <p>Universal has done a great job with presenting the movie. The picture quality looks great, and the audio track makes full use of surrounds. Unfortunately the extras are a disappointment. There are a few gems - the commentary track is great, as it re-teams Sommers and Duscay, and their witty, informative, banter. There is a fluffy making of documentary and some good outtakes presented like a music video. There is a section that shows how various CG sequences were created, but they require too much clicking (a common trait of Universal DVD's). All of the rest are advertisments, including tons of preview footage of the new Scorpion King movie, and a worthless tour inside the new Mummy attraction at Universal theme parks (hope they won't really have actors running around inside like they have here)<p>This is a great movie. It has it's flaws, but the action and adventure more than make up for it. And if those don't get you interested, then Rache Weisz's beauty and strong performance are worth the admission price alone. Check this film out!</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>I find it hysterical when people bash a film like this, that is only supposed to be for entertainment, by not being plot heavy or all that stuff. If, by now, those people don't understand a fun 'popcorn' movie like this, they never will. However, I'm not praising The Mummy Returns. Not by a long shot. First of all, let's get into the story. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are now husband and wife with an 8 year old son. They are sort of a Mommy-Daddy Indiana Jones like adventurers. They find a magical bracelet once owned by The Scorpion King(played by The Rock, who shows the most charisma in a very brief role). He died 5,000 years ago, and is waiting to be brought back. The mummy Imhotep(Arnold Vosloo)is resurrected again(yes! again!), and kidnaps our heroes son who put the bracelet on. The bracelet shows where to go to find The Scorpion King, and then it goes into the usual mumbo jumbo about the end of the world!. Bet you didn't expect that. Okay, so maybe you did. There's so much going on in this film that the plot doesn't really matter. The action scenes are, of course, a lot of fun. The effects are good as always and, in some cases, better than in the original. Brendan Fraser is actually believeable in his role. Watch him in anything else and you would think differently. Rachel Weisz is a gorgeous beauty. I hope to see her and her loveliness in far better material in the future. John Hannah is also back as her annoying brother. This is pure cotton candy folks, and it isn't meant to be taken any other way. It's Indiana Jones light. These movies are pretty fun and harmless. There's nothing wrong with that. This one, however, could of been better. A part 3 is inevitable.</p></br><a href="../users/ALN0TTRTLHA4E.html">ALN0TTRTLHA4E</a><br/><p>Clearly a film like this is not going to be an experience which improves ones mind and starts the nation thinking. However within its constraints it is an enjoyable fast moving film of the special effects genre. <p>I saw the fist film and liked it moderately. It clearly was not a remake of the Boris Karloff film of the same name but got certain plot ideas, which it expanded, into a comedy setting. Its strengths were the principle characters specifically Brendon Fraser and whoever plays the villain. <p>The sequel has the same cast as the original movie. It rather artificially reincarnates the villain from the first movie and we are of again. Some of the film makes absolutely no logical sense. The main characters fight to gain control of an army of mechanical warriors who fight with battle axes. With the invention of modern weapons the only use of this phantom army would be to run a protection racket in a backward town in the Sudan. One can understand that the villain of the film might see this army as impressive he is a reincarnated Egyptian after all. He has not had much time to adopt to the modern world and to see that the battle axe is a bit passe. <p>Never the less the film is reasonably well scripted, the actors look good and perform well and the film is fast passed. <p>The extra bits in the DVD are basically promotional material and explanations about the special effects. One of the weird things about the extra bits is that it shows the actors as actors and one can see how human they are. The character who plays the mummy for instance appears to be rather pudgy and his skin tone is dreadful. The transition to the screen makes a big difference.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this movie. I've read some of the other reviews here, and some people have criticized the movie for being overly cliched and predictable. No doubt some people will say that the movie serves up its hunk of beefcake in all-too-predictable a fashion (don't you hate smart-assed reviewers who take themselves all too seriously?). But come on folks, this sort of action-packed thriller isn't meant to be analyzed or dissected in too much detail--it's meant to be fun, mindless entertainment--and in that regard, it succeeds very well. I was also pleasantly surprised to find The Rock (pro-wrestler Dwayne Johnson) has considerable on-screen presence, as he goes around offing bad guys right and left.<p>Not that The Rock has to carry the whole movie on his own considerable shoulders. The bad-guy king (Steven Brand) who The Rock is sent to assasinate and his sorceress (Kelly Hu) are also good in their roles, as is The Rock's sidekick (unfortunately I don't know the actor's name) who provides some comic relief, much in the same way that R2D2 and C3PO did in the first Star Wars movie (actually Lucas got the idea for the comic pair from one of Kurosawa's movies). <p>The swordplay and fight scenes are top-notch. And speaking of swordplay, big guy Michael Clarke Duncan also has an important role as the Nubian king, and his fight with the Rock is one of the climaxes of the movie, as he almost beats The Rock in a dramatic mano-a-mano sword battle. I'm not sure there were black Nubians, who were well-known in Roman times after the emperor Octavian conquered North Africa, living in Sumeria in 4000 BC, when the Akkadians lived in ancient Sumeria, but as I said, I don't really analyze movies like this too much. It gets in the way of the fun.<p>I don't know what ancient Akkadian or Sumerian sets would look like, either, but these seemed pretty realistic to me and added to the movie's overall ambience. (I'm sure King Sargon of Akkad would have approved even if they weren't--after all, the Akkadians haven't gotten much play in about 4000 years). This sort of action movie plays very well on the Big Screen, and I'm sure I enjoyed seeing it more in a theater as opposed to seeing it on TV. <p>All in all, a fun way to spend a Sat. or Sun. afternoon or evening. Big Steve says goes see it and don't "Bogart" the popcorn.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>Mummy Returns takes the characters and story from the first film and develops on them in a big, big way. The situations and set-pieces are wilder, the odds even bigger and character arcs more complex.<br /><br />Set 10 years after the first movie Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz have made a rich living out of plundering tombs and pyramids. Who could have predicted that their old nemesis Im-Ho-Tep would return faster and stronger than before.<br /><br />But I'm still having trouble seeing Im-Ho-Tep as a villain. Surely it's the scheming, lying, conspiring supplicants that are the real villains. The look in his eyes at the end, when his lover betrays him, is heartbreaking. I can't root for him as a bad guy when he never really does anything bad. Sure he wants to rule the world and all but who doesn't?<br /><br />The effects are not the best (Star Wars Episode 2 used up all the space at ILM at the time) but there are loads of them and they're all lavish and imaginative. I HATE movies that are carried by SFX but Mummy Returns incorporates them into the story in a seamless way. How cool is the big balloon? Or the approach of Anubis' army?<br /><br />Most directors screw-up big budget, big scale movies (AVP, King Arthur, Sky Captain, Exorcist Prequel, Catwoman) but Stephen Sommers knows where the heart of this kind of movie is and delivers, once again, a cheeky adventure with loads and loads of action and enough story and character to back it up.<br /><br />Filmed in Panavision the 2.35:1 anamorphic picture is perfect and the Dolby/DTS 5.1 is very loud and thundering. A very good soundtrack indeed. The extras are total fluff and not worth the time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I can officially say, hands down, I loved The Mummy &amp; The Mummy Returns. Of course, they both had Brendan Fraser in them - always helps. You know what I hate? When films get released, and then they do a prequel. That's what annoys about me the Stars Wars or whatever movies. What is the point?!<p>But OK, &quot;The Rock&quot;, otherwise known as Dwayne Johnson, only had a small, what could almost be called a cameo, in The Mummy Returns. He almost appears from nowhere in the movie, just for a couple of small scenes at the start, and a major scene at the end - but I suppose he's all done by CGI at the end. And to capitalise on his role, Stephen Sommers made a prequel, to explain (albeit not very well) how Mathayus the Scorpion King came to be in The Mummy Returns. And I'm still lost.<p>In The Mummy Returns, Mathayus the Scorpion King looks practically evil, and he really does look different in this. Obviously, they had to give him extensions again, just to keep the continuity, and making me relive my days as a professional Barbie doll hairdresser - I was just itching to braid his hair! I think this was set about 10 years before The Mummy Returns too?<p>What's different between The Mummy movies, and this, is the lack of obvious special effects. Whereas in The Mummy movies, you had people being sucked quite literally dry, or being eaten by beatles, which demanded lots of CGI, there's not very much in this. (If you were a cynical person, which I'm so-o definitely not, then you could say it was due to lack of budget, due to the fact that The Rock got his hands on $5.5million for doing this movie) It's back to basic sword/fist fighting for The Rock, and lots of flexing of muscles. He quite literally romances the clothes off Kelly Hu - which wasn't hard, considering she didn't wear that much during the movie - and does all these weird looks, which totally reminded me of Brendan Fraser/Keanu Reeves/a guy I know! Although I desperately wanted to braid his hair, I think it would have more suitable to have short hair - plus he looks cuter with short hair. Can you imagine having to film days of scenes in the desert with hair like that?! I'd be pulling the extensions out there and then!<p>There's been rumours (or maybe it's truth by now, I'm not totally 'up' on movie/actor news - I need to get down on my hands and knees for that kinda info and beg) that Dwayne will be the next Dirty Harry. HUH?! Where did that come from? OK, so we all know Clint Eastwood is on the wrong side of 70 to be doing anymore Dirty Harry movies. (I've said that now, and thinking he's only 68 or something like that), but Dirty Harry is a character. Maybe if you were to say that he was going to be the next Arnie (with those muscles, hell yeah!), but you can't say someone's gonna be the next so-and-so character. A character is meant to be unique, and the actor who plays him will always be known for playing that character. I'm sorry, but if he does decide to do a Dirty Harry movie, a) Clint will have something to say about it, b) I can't see my mum liking it and c) people reviewing it will make endless comparisons.<p>There's heaps of extras on this, as is on both Mummy DVDs. And they literally take years to get through. Most of them aren't that much worthwhile - unless you're interested in breath-by-breath breakdowns of scenes - so all I was interested was the outtakes! But if you're into those kinda extras (which I'm not, I'd be braindead by the end of them - wait a second, am I?) then you'll be in your element with the DVD.<p>This is a good film. Anyone who follows The Rock in his career as a wrestler, will probably notice little titbits like he uses the same moves or does &quot;the stare&quot;, but I'm not. So he's an OK actor, a little bit wooden sometimes, but no one's perfect.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GQKB1KF0CRPE.html">A3GQKB1KF0CRPE</a><br/><p>The Roc made a splashy appearance in the Return of the Mummy, and got so much attention, the producers rushed to come up with a vehicle for him. They vaguely hint this movie is connected to the Mummy films, but basically the name Scorpion King is all they have in common. When they announced they were doing a remake of the Mummy, I groaned as remakes are usually the pits you think why did they bother, but was pleasantly thrilled with the results. It was wonderful!! I own both Mummy movies on DVD and play them often, for they are movies that can be view again and again and one never tires of them. <p>The Problem with this film???? What made the Mummy films so perfect and the Scorpion King just miss?? I think it is because of Brendan Fraser. He is a powerhouse talent, that is super action star, but his marvellous humour, funny voices and true screen presence, backed with the wonderful Hallam as a foil,makes the Mummy movies work and work well. <p>Scorpion King draws on the same rich texture, the expensive sets and computer work, that made the Mummy movies so opulent. The Rock is a great action star with a bankable presence in Conan the Barbarian vein, but the movie lacks the sharp repartee, wit, heart and dry humour of the first two films and suffers because of it. The action is nearly nonstop, it is wonderfully staged, but there is so much missing.<p>I enjoyed the film and liked the alternative scenes and other bonus selections, but basically, a wee tad sorry I went ahead and bought the DVD solely because I enjoyed them Mummy films. While they will continued to get use, I fear Scorpion Kings is more of a once a year film and will gather dust.<p>The action is great, the costumes and staging on par with the Mummy films...but I hear Peggy Lee singing in the background....is that all there is....???<p>If you have seen the film before and wish to own a copy, you will be thrilled with the DVD version. The sounds and film quality is super, the bonus goodies great. But do not buy this film on the rep of the two mummy films or you might be disappoint, see it first!<p>I am sure The Rock and his OTT WWF charm will see him a huge action star. His fans will not be disappointed. It is a great action film, just missing bullseye.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ.html">A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ</a><br/><p>I had high hopes after the surprisingly good 'The Mummy' became<br />an instant cult classic...but unfortunately it came up short--for me, anyway.  As far as action went, 'The Mummy Returns' certainly delivered, in fact almost too much if you ask me.  As for storyline, I liked the idea of our main couple married and<br />living comfortably in England years after the original *experience* which brought them together in the first film.  But<br />the whole Scorpion King thing left me wondering what went wrong?<br />I realize a certain amount of suspension of belief MUST be done in order to even make an attempt at enjoying these films, but<br />this one took that to the extreme--again, if you ask me.<p>My children thought it was the greatest thing EVER...and unfortunately the younger generation asks less and less of the movies they see, and therefore they seem to lack more and more<br />these days.  Some elements bothered me, including the skeletal<br />pygmies which were never explained, and how poor the ending<p>fight scene with the digitally animated Scorpion King looked overall.  Every time the focus came to the Scorpion Kings face it was a very poor representation of The Rock who played that<br />character...sure you could see the similarities, but overall it<br />looked poor.  The problem with this is that special effects these days have become SO GOOD, the bar has been raised, and if<br />something doesn't look 100% REAL, well it tends to be almost cheesy.  <p>Gripes aside, it was still worth seeing and my 9 year old daughter has it listed as her ALL-TIME favorite movie (where did I go wrong???).  Searching for a mindless load of action?  'The Mummy Returns' certainly fits the bill--and then some.  The added bonus features in this particular DVD version definitely make this buy even better, and without spoiling it, give it a shot and I think you might see it again just to see those extra's.</p></br><a href="../users/AW003H7Z3OCHA.html">AW003H7Z3OCHA</a><br/><p>Thats right! This movie is a great action tale in the spirit of the distant departed Indiana Jones Eygptian epics. This mummy sequel is better than the Original Mummy (which established the characters &amp; theme). All of the ensemble cast returns. The established characters roles are expanded, action packed, great dual love story (immortal vs mortal), unbelievable special effects. Like Indiana Jones movies you buy into the story and question nothing about the physical or mental capabilities of the characters or plot.<br />In summary: Our hero's are a family unit. We find out the destinies of 2 plots. Good (True Love) vs Evil (Symbolic Love) and all that goes with it. Indiana Jones was basically a single (loner) macho scientific action hero who defied and conquered all a trilogy we all loved. The Mummy Series provides a team of individuals with unique talents when established and thrown together form an unbeatable team.<br />Indiana Jones remained single where as Rick O'Connell marries Evie and have a Son. This trio actively and cooperatively solve riddles, battle and succeed together.<br />This DVD is Widescreen and Digitally Enhanced to provide the best picture, period. If you are a PROGRESSIVE SCAN, COMPONENT VIDEO, HDTV/16:9 WIDESCREEN OWNER, with a DIGITAL THEATRE SYSTEM OWNER stand by for one of the greatest cinematic rides ever.<br />Like Indiana Jones, Rick &amp; Evie capture our hearts and lead us on a great 1930's Eygptian Adventure.<br />P.S. - Wait to you find out the O'Connells real destinies. That is the real story which unfolds!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>"The Mummy Returns" is the bigger and flashier sequel to 1999's "The Mummy", itself a nicely updated homage to the Boris Karloff classic. The good news is that the excellent cast of the "The Mummy" have returned for the sequel. Unfortunately, bigger and flashier does not make up for a lack of plot and character development; "The Mummy Returns" is entertaining but ultimately disappointing.<br /><br />The movie opens with a retelling of the Legend of the Scorpion King (played by The Rock) who vanished in ancient times but can be revived with the right magic.  Flash forward to the present of 1933, where Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (Rachel Weisz) have married and had time to raise eight-year-old son Alex while continuing their adventures in Egyptian archeology.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the past, both recent and distant, reaches out to touch their lives.  Rachel's never-do-well brother Jonanthan (John Hannah) inadavertently draws the attention of a mysterious group seeking to resurrect the past using a bracelet with magical powers.  In a chaotic attack on O'Connell Manor, Alex, wearing the bracelet, is kidnapped.  The remainder of the movie is a series of set-piece action sequences as Rick, Evie, and Jonathan, accompanied by the Egyptian warrior Ardeth Bey, chase the returned Mummy Imhotep and his army of the dead in order to rescue Alex.  A final confrontation at the edge of the Underworld will pit Rick against both Imhotep and the revived Scorpion King.<br /><br />The special effects are the highlight of the movie, each sequence more visually stunning than the last.  The Scorpion King in the final scenes looks sadly out of place is what is otherwise a CGI festival.  Lacking is a coherent plot or any sense of reverence for the original storyline that made "The Mummy" worth watching.  At two and a half hours, the movie is overlong, and delivers very little originality.<br /><br />This movie is recommended to those who didn't see the original movie and will enjoy the special effects without missing the storyline.</p></br><a href="../users/A41I67QYRAOSQ.html">A41I67QYRAOSQ</a><br/><p>This movie is a spin off from the Mummy.  They've done a good job with the concept.  There is a good story line that keeps you wondering how is this going to work out.  The characters are believable and likeable.

Some of the other characters weren't that great either in terms of their acting abilities, but "The Rock" was the worst offender.

Maybe I was just in the mood to see a lot of things blow up real good.  There's not much point describing the plot, because it's only a flimsy skeleton upon which to hang the action sequences, which go on pretty much non-stop from beginning to end.  Everything is completely predictable, but it's humorous and moves fast.  It's easily the best of the Mummy trilogy (counting "Scorpion King"), but that's not saying much.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>all 3 movies i really love the mummy and the chemistry between the actors the sense of humor and action doesn't get bettter than that..</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Mathayus the Akkadian (Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson)defeats a powerful warlord (Steven Brand) and rescues a beautiful sorceress (Kelly Hu) in this Conan-lite adventure.  The Rock showed that he had the presence to carry a film, but the story is ridden with cliches and the narrative is strewn with coincidence.  There is always a handy escape route when the Rock needs it, and he always encounters unexpected comrades when they are required.  Brand is miscast as the warlord; he is not physically imposing and never quite seems like a match for Johnson.  The only things that raise this film (barely) to the 3-star level are the Rock's charisma and some decent action scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EUG9W2IAVCT.html">A2EUG9W2IAVCT</a><br/><p>I first saw The Mummy in 1999 in theaters.  I was in eighth grade, and the spectacle awed me, but also kept me up all night long, covers pulled over my head, radio on and hoping to see daylight.  The Mummy Returns is a Hollywood rarity in that it is as enjoyable as the first, if not quite up to parr as the 1999 predecessor.  In the end, this film rocks.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>Where "The Mummy" was impressive "The Mummy Returns" is a highly impressive movie that is stunning and extraordinarily breathtaking in its non stop action, superb plot and innate comedy!  When director Stephen Sommers put "The Mummy" on the silver screen he set a very high standard for himself and those involved.  In "The Mummy Returns," he not only exceeds that standard, he raised the bar to an entirely new level that a third film will have a hard time measuring up to.  Given how magnificent the first two films are though, I'm sure that all involved will certainly raise the standards even higher should they decide to make a third movie.<p>Where "The Mummy" had "some" amazing CGI provided by ILM, "The Mummy Returns" is stuffed to the gills with their fine work!  To say that the CGI in this film was amazing is simply an understatement.  Adding to the allure of this movie is the fact that all of the actors from the first movie returned to reprise their respective rolls.  The ever beautiful Rachel Weisz and the adventurer Brendan Fraser are nothing less than spectacular in their roles.  Oded Fehr, having had a much smaller part in the first movie, easily steps up to the much larger role in this movie.<p>Of the many movies over the years that have attempted to portray ancient Egypt, this and the first movie are tops as far as their realism and overall feel of the movie, bringing the viewer "into" ancient Egypt through such highly detailed realism.<p>The premise:<p>We flashback five thousand years and see "The Rock" as The Scorpion King leading his armies across Egypt only to run into resounding defeat and the humiliation of being sent into the sacred desert of Ahm Shere to die along with what was left of his Army.  Seeking revenge upon those who defeated him, The Scorpion King offers Anubis, God of the underworld, his soul.  Anubis accepted the offer and gave The Scorpion King his Army...<p>It is now nine years after the events depicted in "The Mummy" and the Mummy, played perfectly by Arnold Vosloo is about to be resurrected by none other than a woman who appears to be Anck Su Namun, but without her spirit resurrected from the dead.  She plans to resurrect Imhotep and then he can bring back Anck Su Namun's spirit into her vassal.  They then plan to find The Scorpion King's resting place, defeat him and take control of the Army of Anubis and take over the world!  This is all a great plan of course, except for one small problem; the Bracelet of Anubis, which can lead them to The Scorpion King, has recently come into the possession of the O'Connell's.<p>What follows is as stated above, one of the best films to come out this millennium that combines intriguing Egyptology, non stop action, superb humor and a well matched cast to make it one of the most enjoyable and fun movies to watch.<p>I highly recommend this film and its predecessor as they're both extremely entertaining!  {ssintrepid}<p>Widescreen Collector's Edition Special Features:<p>- An Exclusive Conversation with The Rock<br />- Unlock the Secrets to "The Scorpion King:" DVD-ROM Link to the movie production<br />- Spotlight on Location:  The Making of "The Mummy Returns"<br />- Visual and Special Effects Formation<br />- Feature Commentary<br />- Outtakes - This is extraordinarily entertaining but too short.<br />- Live's "Forever May Not Be Long Enough"<br />- Egyptology 201<br />- Theatrical Trailer<br />- DVD-ROM Features:  "The Mummy" PC game demo and screen savers<br />- And several other special features...</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>It took me forever to finally rent this movie. I'm a huge fan of action and costume movies, and this one had both.<br />This is packed with quirky humor ( just like bits of it in the mummy) and great fighting seqences. The Rock is a good actor, i must say. There wasn't one moment where I was thinking "god, he can't act".<br />I've been a big fan of Kelly Hu since she was seen on Martial Law, a series with Samo Hung, canceled a few years ago.<br />I think she can fight better than the ROck, but in this movie, she used a few cool magic tricks ( the one with the cobra was an amazing scene) to save her butt.<br />Great movie, that I will have to buy, or I won't be able to sleep at night.</p></br><a href="../users/AATKF0HDBQL86.html">AATKF0HDBQL86</a><br/><p>I was a wrestling fan long before The Scorpion King ever came out, and I have to say that Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock, is a master showman in whatever medium he chooses.  As Mathayus, the Arkadian assassin, he is a force to be reckoned with, hacking his way through his enemies with nary a backward glance.  His one weak spot is the Sorceress (Kelly Hu) he was meant to kill, but when he realizes the depth of his feelings for her, he will do anything to protect her.  Dwayne Johnson manages to combine both these elements into one film without making the story into a total joke in the process.<p>I would like to point out that this movie is not for everyone.  If you're one of those out there who are looking for a film that is gravid with meaning and emotion, then The Scorpion King isn't for you.  If you just want to see an action-packed film that happens to have some fine acting in it as well, then by all means, grab your wallet out and buy it.  It's your choice.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU.html">A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU</a><br/><p>i thought i was going to like this film, i was excited about seeing it, but while watching it, i always wondered, why is everybody fighting? some of the fighting just didn't seem to be needed in the story. and also i wasn't that impressed with the weird monsters attacking at the beginning and end of the film in the desert, as far as computer graphics were concerned. also the scorpion king graphics looked more like a computer game than something real and hideous and frightening. sorry, i thought it would be better than what it was.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS7LYGLUX34L.html">ATS7LYGLUX34L</a><br/><p>With a film like The Scorpion King, you should know going in that it's gonna be dopey. The question is, will it be entertaining? The answer, in this case, is yes. The film is a relatively solid Summer action flick, with decent effects and exciting fight scenes.<p>  The Rock stars as Matthias, A.K.A. the titular "Scorpion King". The last of a race of legendary assassins, he stages a one-man assault on the King who killed his brother. That's pretty much it, plotwise. The Rock is no Laurence Olivier, but he gets the job done. <p>  The Rock gets able assistance from the lovely Kelly Hu, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Grant Heslov, the comic relief who steals every scene he's in. The fight between The Rock and Duncan is worth the price of admission alone, and the climactic battle is very well done. <p>  If you go in expecting Citizen Kane, well yeah......you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for an entertaining, mind-numbing way to spend 101 minutes, look no further. I had a good time, and it seemed like everyone else in the theater did, too.

I was very disapointed by this bad movie. I expected that is was going to be good. It turned out to be very cartoonish. When one of the bad guys is hit with an arrow, their bodies fly backwards as if they were hit with a shotgun. How is an arrow able to propel someone's body into the air ? I also must complain about the special effects. The special effects are very poor. I expected great special effects like what I saw in The Mummy Returns. <p>If you want to get a movie with The Rock, then buy  The Mummy Returns instead. The Scorpion King should be erased from all movie history. It should have been produced as a one hour TV special, like Zena or Herculees.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>Ten years after their original bout with Imhotep, Rick (Fraser) and Evelyn (Weisz) O'Connell have settled down and have an eight-year-old son, Alex.

It's up to the couple to save the world--and their incorrigible son--once more.<br /><br />This episode has all the facets of the original "Mummy" coupled with an enduring love and an endearing little boy who literally steals the show from both good and bad guys.  This is more slash and burn style archeology without the gore of an Indiana Jones film.

To me, the decision seemed, and most likely was, simply an attempt from Universal to make more money on a successful franchise, and not really produce much of anything that would further the storyline established in the previous two movies. Since this movie was apparently rushed into production directly after "The Mummy Returns" wrapped, I thought I was probably right in the whole "cash cow" approach Universal was taking with the movie, and that we were going to be left with a well-below average movie, and the franchise would most likely suffer a quick, yet painful death because of it.<br /><br />"The Scorpion King" is the story of an Akkadian assassin named Mathayus (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson), who vows to avenge his brother's murder at the hands of an undefeated warlord (Steven Brand). To complete his quest for vengeance and fulfill his destiny as foretold in a prophecy stating that Mathayus will become the desert-ruling Scorpion King, he must join forces with a beautiful, yet dangerous sorceress (Kelly Hu), and a rival Nubian warrior (Michael Clarke Duncan). With their tentative partnership, Mathayus and company are in for the fight of their lives as they take on the warlord's massive army in hopes of toppling his oppressive rule.<br /><br />Even though I had plenty of doubts about this movie, as did most critics, the film turned out to be not all that bad, and even managed a moderate box office return. While not up to par with either of the previous two films in the series, "The Scorpion King" does an adequate job of providing an entertaining, somewhat campy, and extremely coincidental back-story for the character. The writing was average, which fits in perfectly with the rest of the movie's various aspects, i.e. acting, fight scenes, dialogue, etc. Some of the dialogue was a little too modernized for me, showing that the team of writers was obviously not wanting to create any semblance of historical accuracy with the movie, which I didn't expect to find a whole lot here anyhow. The humor was hit-and-miss this time around, not nearly as polished in execution or quality as its predecessors had been, and at times went far too campy to achieve laughs that some of the comedic situations became more annoying than humorous.<br /><br />Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson ("Walking Tall"), who is no stranger to choreographed fighting due to his time spent with WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment), obviously has no trouble handling the action scenes and making them entertaining for the audience. Along with his aptitude for fighting, Johnson also showed that he had some acting chops, plenty of onscreen charisma, and a seemingly good sense of humor; in essence, the future skills of another Hollywood action hero was being honed and developed with this movie. Michael Clarke Duncan ("Daredevil") shows up in an essentially one-note performance as a rival warrior and eventual comrade to Mathayus. I was disappointed that Michael wasn't given more to do in this movie, I mean a little more expansion could have been done in regards to the adversarial relationship between his character, Balthazar, and Mathayus; instead, it's just lightly touched upon and is over with almost as quickly as it began. The other cast members were good in their roles, nothing outstanding or truly noteworthy. Actress Kelly Hu provides the obligatory eye candy for the predominantly male audience and cast, as the warlord's seductive sorceress. I have yet to see what Kelly's range as an actress is as she is given little more to do here than she had been given as the essentially mute villain Lady Deathstrike in "X2: X-Men United". So, I really can't say if we've seen the extent of Kelly's talents or not, but for some reason Hollywood likes her, so I would think that there must be some level of talent here; although this is the same town that has a fascination with Hayden Christensen, who has proven time and again that he is not a good actor no matter how hard he tries.<br /><br />The action sequences in "The Scorpion King", which are many in number, relied much more on physical stunts, wirework, and good ol' fashioned fight choreography than either of the previous two movies had done. In "The Mummy" and "The Mummy Returns" much of the action was very CGI oriented, with some wirework being done, and a lot of the fights involved gunplay; however, given this story's timeframe being set much earlier in world history, all the action is done with mostly swords and bows and arrows, giving a much more up close and personal feel to all of the fighting. Most of the stunts were well done, although fairly far-fetched much of the time, generally not to the point that it was distracting from the movie; but, there were a few instances where I thought the stunts had gone too far over-the-top that the director, Chuck Russell ("Eraser"), could have shown some restraint and attempted to ground the film in some semblance of our reality.<br /><br />"The Scorpion King" is a decent spin-off, something Hollywood is rarely good at achieving, that creates an entertaining, albeit far-fetched, back-story to an intriguing character that was introduced all too briefly in "The Mummy Returns". Fairly good acting, fun action sequences, and an average story help to make "The Scorpion King" a moderately entertaining piece of movie fluff that will do nothing to impress you, but will provide you with a brief escape from the real world.<br /><br />"The Scorpion King" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sensuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A28ILXH590CMRJ.html">A28ILXH590CMRJ</a><br/><p>Basically a spin-off of the greatly successful MUMMY movies, THE SCORPION KING tells the story of an Akadian assassin (Dwayne Johnson AKA The Rock), who defeats an evil warlord and becomes the powerful Scorpion King.  Borrowing from genres as old as Conan the Barbarian, this is an old fashioned sword and sorcery flick that, while it might not be art, still has more than its share of entertainment.  The Rock has a solid screen presence and makes a credible action hero in the title role, while Kelly Hu is lovely as the sorceress who captures his heart.  Of course, there are the obligitory sidekicks and fellow warriors, including the always dependable Michael Clarke Duncan as a Nubian warrior. At about 90 minutes, the film moves at a brisk pace and doesn't allow one to dwell too much on the obvious absurdities that too many films of this type may have.  Having said that, THE SCORPION KING makes for a fun flick for those who love their action epics with a big helping of cheese.  Recommended for those who love action films and have a good sense of humor.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTSOBAPOWT3.html">A1ZTSOBAPOWT3</a><br/><p>Right when the movie starts, a fat guy gets nailed in the head with a sharp object. You know that this movie is only about the action and nothing else. The Rock is Mathayus, a bounty hunter who is targeted by an evil kingdom and a hot woman (Kelly Hu) whom she knows is a god. Why? I don't remember. But, just forget the plot, it's all about the WWE format. The Rock vs. Michael Clarke Duncan in a no DQ match that lasts five minutes! It was almost like a table match. It would've been great if Bubba Ray Dudley walked by and screamed, 'get the tables!!' Body slams and all, "The Great One" raises his eyebrow for the people. You know he saves the day and becomes a king, duh. He's "The Scorpion King." After watching this movie, the heavyweight championship isn't important anymore. The Rock should pursue an action movie career and give somebody a spine buster or rock bottom sometime. Watch "The Scorpion King" for entertainment only. If you're looking for a story and some kind of meaning, watch "Conan the Barbarian." Although, they're pretty similar.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EUG9W2IAVCT.html">A2EUG9W2IAVCT</a><br/><p>Had it been a true-to-the-time portrayl instead of a hardcore rock-and-roll infused piece of Hollywood it might've faired better at the box office and critics.  Though The Mummy series never received any huge accolades beyond it being a fun, action-packed action/comedy like the Indiana Jones series, this part is hardly up to par with its two predecessors.  The hard metal music does not help the action sequences but distances them from being way too modern, as does some of the humerous, but not true-to-the-times speech, especially by the Rock.  Still, it's action-packed and full of great special effects, but it's HARDLY at the same level as The Mummy or The Mummy Returns.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Director Stephen Sommers is responsible for some of the more questionable box-office films I've ever seen. Unlike Uwe Boll who has the box office match his talent (read: none), Sommers' films have actually been successful for the most part but right afterwards, people say how awful they were which is kind of funny. Among them is the sequel to the blockbuster hit the Mummy which had good effects but a super bad story but of course the latter is irrevelant if the film made money, hence we have the Mummy Returns where the keyword is "more": more effects, setpieces, characters, and all-around dumbness.<br /><br />Set 9 years after the last film, Rick and Evelyn have gotten married and have a child named Alex. They get caught up in a rescue mission when Alex is kidnapped since he wears the Bracelet of Anubis, which ties into the Scorpion King, an ancient powerful warrior who's about to be resurrected. Killer of the Scorpion King can command a massive army so people decide to resurrect Ihmotep, our mummy from the first film. And once again, Rick and Evelyn along with Ardeth Bay and Evelyn's brother Jonathan have to once again avert disaster.<br /><br />It's surprising to see that despite the special effects advancements over the years, the Mummy films have always had way too obvious CG. It has nothing to do with compositing and placing them in the scene that makes them look natural and not just pasted on but there's something off about the effects, like they're too texture-y and light. Nowhere is this more apparent than the Scorpion King himself and I won't spoil it but basically, I've seen Diablo II have better looking characters. However, one advancement that should've got more recognition is the big battle scenes involving thousands of armies. While it's old-hat now thanks to films like Kingdom of Heaven, Troy, Alexander and the Lord of the Rings films, this just looks better to me. The set pieces also don't have the grandiose nature from the first film. A massive tidal wave didn't have the impact of seeing a sandstorm from the last one and it makes this film obviously inferior to the first one.<br /><br />A film like this doesn't need an in-depth story. It's a summer blockbuster and knows it; you come for the thrills and visuals, not to be riveted by dialogue exchanges and character development. But still, this is kind of a stupid story. A bracelet of something will reveal the location of someone allowing a something to defeat that someone and able to command something is basically the plot and we jump from location to location and have little mini-adventures along the way. There's a sequence involving tiny pygmy mummies (but I call them monkeys) that is not only unintentionally funny but it completely apes off a similar scene in the Lost World: Jurassic Park. Or maybe I'm just complaining too much.<br /><br />There's not really a lot to recommend here. Most movies have at least something to recommend, whether it's the visuals, the acting, or just the plain strangeness of enjoying something so dumb. I don't completely hate it and why that is is kinda baffling.</p></br><a href="../users/AAECAHBNP1VD2.html">AAECAHBNP1VD2</a><br/><p>even if it is somewhat more lacking in plot development or common sense. By all logic, after the first. there was no way the Mummy should've been able to return, but hey; it's Hollywood.<br />Again, this is one long rollercoaster ride, with a tip of the tanna leaf to Indiana Jones. Special effects are, again, engaging as hell, Evie somehow managed to get much sexier, Alex lends a nice touch, O'Connel and Im-ho-tep retain the same touches from 1, and there's never a problem with more of Patricia, even if she really can't act. The new crop of villians worked, too, for what they were. Definitely woprth seeing, and some great extras.

But that's exactly the opposite of the same character in his very own movie. In fact he struggles to overthrow an evil ruler for those very reasons.<br /><br />So when, and why, did he become bad? I'm afraid I'm not following this. The movie, however, is entertaining, if rather short and silly. Chuck Russell tries to cram in loads of fighting and hokum as he can. It works and The Rock is very cool as said King (or Mathayus) and former Jason victim Kelly Hu is gorgeous as the scantily-clad Cassandra. Grant Heslov and Michael Clarke Duncan fill out their usual roles as ethnic comic-relief and big, muscle guy.<br /><br />The film has slightly less integrity to it than the Mummy movies. This is evident with the fun and lively, but completely inappropriate, score by John Debney. I'm not expecting anything like his Passion of the Christ score but blaring death metal guitars seem kinda out of place in a movie set 3000 years BC.<br /><br />But this movie is a cheeseburger, not a 17-course dinner. So why bother complaining. After all it's a prequel of a sequel of a movie that was a re-make of a movie that was made in the 30's. But it's well made and loads of fun so just go along with it and you'll enjoy.<br /><br />Filmed in Panavision the Blu Ray looks and sounds great, with lots of extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>Though you'll want to watch the ages of children or grandchildren on this one (view it by yourself first to decide if it's appropriate for their ages), this set is worthy of shelf space. The graphics in each movie are great, though I do think the first one was the best, they did wonderful sequels. You'll also want to check out 'The Scorpion King'.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

In the summer of 2001 I went to catch it at the theater with two friends and after about ten minutes we were all bored senseless by the incredible bombardment of action and F/X. We just layed back in our seats for the next two hours in utter tedium.<br /><br />It's a curious thing that too much action (and F/X) in a film can be boring. It may not seem logical but it's true, and "The Mummy Returns" is Exibit A. I recently considered the possibility that my first impression may have been in error so I decided to re-watch it after over five years. Yet, after a mere 10-15 minutes I was again completely detached from the picture, even though there were all kinds of exciting things going on, or, at least, things that SHOULD HAVE been exciting.<br /><br />"The Mummy Returns" has a lot going for it: A great cast, locations, costumes, cinematography, F/X, etc. In addition it has a great Indiana Jones appeal. Unfortunately it all adds up to a cinematic piece of excrement. What went wrong? Simply put, no substance. "The Mummy Returns" abandons the characters, and the plot is utilized simply as a flimsy clothesline for action and F/X sequences.<br /><br />FINAL ANALYSIS: "The Mummy Returns" has so many ingredients right, but it somehow utterly fails. It's unadulterated cinematic JUNK. It should be utilized in filmmaking classes as the quintessential example of style over substance -- having all the right elements, including budget, and stupefyingly fumbling the ball.<br /><br />Needless to say this could have been a great film franchise, but it was not to be. "Returns" put an end to that.</p></br><a href="../users/A27QZDO1FRRFCV.html">A27QZDO1FRRFCV</a><br/><p>Its kinda hard to see this as pre-qual to The Mummy...<br />  Pretty good set was used if not the real thing, to re-create an anciat egyption city but it does look to me that they hired bodybuilders and pornstars to repesent the guards and the egyption ladies just to save a few bucks.<br /> Alough this copy the useal action/fighting ending fight seqence<br />Witch is Boss vs. Boss and 1 Army vs. a nother Army, good guy almost loseing but good guy getting the big finish...<br /> All in All it could have been better,,, but its someting that kinda gets old after a few times.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WE94927YC3KI.html">A2WE94927YC3KI</a><br/><p>This movie was perfect and great.

What I CAN decide is that this movie can be described as pure escapism. Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold Vosloo, Patricia Velasquez, and (even) The Rock have given fine performances. The special effects may be a bit too over-the-top but it's still marvelous to look at. Fast pace, fast adventures, and a different music score (this time it's Alan Silvestri and not Jerry Goldsmith) give feast for the eyes and ears. Watch this movie. It'll help you escape far far away.<br /><br />A-</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>The original Mummy was an incredible film, mixing suspense, horror, action, and comedy. This film is nearly as good, though with much less suspense, and a whole lot more action.<br /><br />I won't sit here and tell you that this is better than the original, or even as good, but it comes pretty darn close.<br /><br />I would NOT say that character developement lacked. On top of the first movie, this film had just what it needed. What would films be like without characters like these? We have Jonathan, the comedy relief, Rick, the hero who doubles as comedy relief and Evie, the hero's wife who plays an adventerous role. The others are great too.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is a must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5LA07JCDWTN.html">A2C5LA07JCDWTN</a><br/><p>There are no more action heros. Really. Arnold is washed-up. Stallone is making straight to video movies. The Rock oozes with potential to be the next great action hero. The Scorpion King is nothing more than a showcase for The Rock's vast talents. He is not just muscle-bound but witty and even downright funny in many scenes. This guy has got charisma and style, now he just needs the substance. The Scorpion King is filled with almost every tired action film cliche yet The Rock still carries this film on his back to respectibility. Just think, this is his 1st starring role...the potential is unlimited. As for The Scorpion King, the action scenes are good except for the last battle scene and the sandstorm scene which are great. Overall, this is entertaining mindless fun for action buffs or wrestling fans. Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I am so confused.  I know the Rock played a character called the Scorpion King in "The Mummy Returns," which was supposed to set up this film.  But the character has gone from a silent, brooding warrior of great strength and skill to a wisecracking, snarling warrior of great strength and skill.  Did I miss something?  At least in "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" they explained how the character went from being the villain to the hero.  No such explanation is offered here for what I thought was a similar transition.  Then again, maybe I am guilty of thinking, which is not a prerequisite skill for watching this film.<p>Ironically, you might enjoy this film more if you have not seen "The Mummy Returns," especially if you are a devotee of WWF wrestling, the arena in which the Rock originally perfected his eyebrow arching technique.  The story is set way before the pyramids were build, when the original Scorpion King, Memnon (Steven Brand) was the best swordsman on the planet and used the prophetic talents of a sorceress (Kelly Hu) to rule the known desert.  Going up against him are the Arkadians, a group of professional assassins, of which Mathayus (the Rock) is the best and the brightest.  He is aided by a giant Nubian (Michael Clarke Duncan) is what is certainly an homage to the legendary friendship between Gilgamesh and Enkidu (sorry, I was thinking again).  Anyhow, "The Scorpion King" is clearly a standard action adventure in which the hero has to kill the bad guy, win the woman, and rule happily ever after.  <p>It dawns on me that this film is similar to "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."  That film made Hong Kong wire work a part of the Hollywood cinematic repertoire, where as this film does the same for WWF Wrestling techniques.  This film is not happy unless it is going over the top.  When our hero shoots somebody with an arrow in this film the result is comparable to having used a small tactical missile: they are sent flying through the wall.  The film certainly delivers exactly what you would expect, high energy heroics at breakneck speed, but a bit more creativity would have been nice.  At least the dialogue knows it is supposed to be either tongue in cheek or painfully bad, so you cannot hold that against the film.  The Rock delivers the performance demanded by his fans, so that is not going to be grounds for big complaints either.  I did enjoy the film, more than I thought I would, but the ultimate standard for an action film is your desire to watch it again and again, and on that critical score "The Scorpion King" falls short</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>Writer-director Stephen Sommers succeeds in creating a sequel that is even worse than its predecessor. Another example of how outdated Hollywood cliches such as mummy stories should be left in their tomb undisturbed. With even less character development and plot than the original, this movie puts all its stakes on the dazzling special effects that are too absurd if not comically bizarre to be credible.<br /><br /> The story now focuses on the Scorpion King (The Rock) who, after being dead for 5,000 years, comes to life again in the '30s to defend his newly discovered oasis from evildoers. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are back but married with a young son named Alex (Freddie Boath) to find the oasis before the antagonists.<br /><br /> Bad acting and shallow characters are as numerous as grains of sand in a desert storm; suffocating the audience with forced expressions and contrived dialogue. The Rock seems more interested in embellishing himself in his first feeble attempts at acting outside of a WWF match than actually playing the role of his character. The movie reaches the absurd in how the characters go off on their &quot;epic&quot; adventure. A flying carpet discovered in a tomb or souk by accident would have been more credible than the ridiculous flying contraption used by the characters to reach their destination.<br /><br /> If you want to laugh at how bad a movie can be, by all means, rent this movie. Again, a perfect demonstration on how long-dead story concepts should be kept in their Hollywood sarcophagi never to rise again. To bring them back to life and torment an audience ad nauseam is a curse indeed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NYQCLFQRTI74.html">A2NYQCLFQRTI74</a><br/><p>No plot, no credible facts. King Scorpion and Imhotep didn't even live in the same time frame. When will Hollywood learn?!<p>This is a pathetic sequel to the first film, The Mummy (which was much more fun). It is also a film which make several references to older films in some scenes oh! so clich&eacute; (the jet airship?!?). The scriptwriters obviously did not care about making any sense when writing this junk. Alex's mother would worry but not the father?!?!?! Oh pleeease. The kid seems to have been, at first, a copy of Ramses Peabody (see the Amelia Peabody series written by Elizabeth Peters); however this dissolves after his meeting with the mummy.<p>A film as full of oh! so phony special effects as possible. Some scenes even look like video games. It is so incredibly gory too.<p>The two stars I give for making me laugh from beginning to end, and for its unbelievable stupidity throughout the story.</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>this movie is not good, at all, I want Mummy 3, not a wrestler starring spin off, this isn't Mummy 3 simply because theres no Mummy, no Rick O' Connell, it's just a bad spin off</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>The original "The Mummy" had scary moments, a great story line, enough humor to keep the tension level manageable, and plenty of action.  All combined to make "The Mummy" thoroughly enjoyable.  Of course, one incredibly successful movie begets a sequel; thus we have "The Mummy Returns".<p>This time we figure out how to tie together Evelyn Carnahan O'Connell (Rachel Weisz) and Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velazquez).  They knew each other!  Of course!  How could we have not known?  This relationship is used to tie together the parts of the story to the end, though it felt a touch contrived in places.<p>The beginning of the movie starts off with some of the best action in the movie, as the Scorpion King's amulet is found, Imhotep is brought back to life and there is a goodly amount of chasing around and fighting as various characters are introduced.  However, from this point forward the movie seems to lose its way.  While the general concept of needing to be at the Scorpion King's oasis to gain his power is pretty straight forward, some of the journey to get there is a bit of a stretch, falling almost into comedy rather than a serious movie.  The best example is the balloon used to travel to Africa.  I admit I liked the balloon.  However, this balloon just didn't seem to fit with the tenor and quality of the original, and I was a bit disappointed.<p>There were other places where I was a bit disappointed with the movie as well, but my biggest disappointment was that there was so much potential from the original that was left unexploited, and the ultimate effect was that the movie seemed more of way to make some quick money versus trying to create a worthy successor to "The Mummy".<p>Though I felt the movie could have been better, there were parts that shine through as successes.  The train was excellent.  I am a fan of trains, and the train used in this movie was perfect, with superior detail.  The Scorpion King digital effects were very good.  Most of the portion of the movie inside the pyramid at the end was well done.  There are other places that were also well done mixed in with an occasionally slow story that doesn't hold a candle to the original.<p>Had this movie not had such a good predecessor, I suspect that I would have enjoyed it more.  However, the comparison is automatic.  In spite of my complaints and the down sides of this movie, it's still a decent movie.  Not great, but okay.  While I may be in danger of wearing out "The Mummy" DVD, it's unlikely that "The Mummy Returns" will get much more than an occasional playing.  This could have been a 5 star movie, but the occasionally cheesy story and the lack of a serious scare factor for most of the movie pushes this movie back into the realm of a very low 4 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>I saw this movie about three hours before I watched the new Star Wars film and, believe it or not, this film is better.  Surprised?  So was I; I watch this film in a theater that was practically empty, me and 1 other person.  Boy that was fun!  Boy was this film fun!  It was enjoyable from start to finish, not a boring bit in the entire film.  This is a great DVD to own since it translates very well to the small screen.  &quot;The Rock&quot; did a great job, another surprise.  I know it's hard to believe but it's true; watch it for yourself.</p></br></body></html>

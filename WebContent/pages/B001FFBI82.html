'Jarhead' doesn't showcase marine films as a typical war or action/heroism flick, its much more than that. Let's forget war and politics for sometime and simply just look into the lives of these soldiers, who happen to be a human just like you and me. A brilliant performence from Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamiee Fox quite easily engages your mind and glues you to the edge of your seat, the chemistry between them is outstanding. The musical score is decent and the cinematography is simply breathtaking. Overall, A decently made film, moreover a real film with real characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>Never read the memoir, but they say the movie is just like it. However, the print version is probably more entertaining. There's drama in the movie, just not very involving such as when Jake G goes nuts and almost shoots a fellow Marine, or when one of Jake's buddy's goes nuts when he is not allowed to fire a sniper shot at a distant Iraqi. I felt nothing during those scenes. This is a combo of old-fashioned Marine boot camp cliches and a somewhat updated take on what it was like to be a GI in the first Gulf War. It made me realize the U.S. has been wasting its time over there for almost 20 years now.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Using the deserts of the Southwest and California and under the direction of Sam Mendes, we get an unabashed depiction of U.S. Marine involvement in Iraq.  Through the eyes of marine ("jarhead") Anthony Swofford played by Jake Gyllenhaal, we get the full view of his experiences commencing in the harsh brutal environment of basic training.<br /><br />Gyllenhaal trains as a scout sniper under the tough love of his platoon leader SSgt. Sykes played nicely by Jamie Foxx.  They eventually ship out to the deserts of Saudi Arabia soon after the seizure of Kuwait by Iraq.  Each man must deal with the stress and anxiety of possible chemical and biologic warfare and months of boring inactivity in the sweltering desert heat.  As time rolls on Gyllenhaal, whose family life is a disaster becomes obsessed about the fidelity of his girlfriend from back home.  This puts more focus on murkiness behind the objectives of the Marine presence there.<br /><br />Director Mendes does a meritorious job of creating the hellhole of a setting that Desert Shield was including oil spewing burning wells and incinerated corpses decaying under the desert sun.  He aptly points out that this experience can't help but shape the future of all those who served in that conflict.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>"Jarhead" is the true story of Anthony Swafford (Gyllenhaal) from basic training through the Gulf War.  Basic training is rough and reminiscent of the movie "Full Metal Jacket".  Swafford emerges from the training as a sniper candidate, and becomes best friends with his spotter, Tony (Sarsgaard).  Sergeant Siek (Foxx) is their commander, and sees them as the best snipers of the group.  In 1990, Swafford's unit is sent to Iraq to participate in the Gulf War, but this war is not a war for snipers, and he soon finds himself ready to fight, but never allowed to.<br /><br />The unit is trained and trained and trained to be their very best, but there is no outlet for all their training, and soon that begins to take its toll.  They are soldiers who are unable to use the skills that they have, and sooner or later someone is going to snap.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent as the baby faced Swafford, and is a definite candidate for an Oscar nomination.  Sarsgaard, who has been in a number of films this year, finally has found a role to really shine in.  Finally, Foxx is perfect as a true Marine that loves being a Marine.  "Jarhead" is an interesting war movie that really has little war in it.  Its focus is on the people that are there to fight the war, and what happens when the highly trained men are not allowed to do what they have been trained for.  This is the best war movie in recent years, and I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>This film, which is based on Anthony Swofford's account of his experiences in Desert Shield and Desert Storm, is a bit controversial but controvery that makes us think is a good thing.<br /><br />In some ways this film is the exact opposite of the film Black Hawk Down. In Black Hawk Down, the war action never ends, whereas in Jarhead it never seems to start. Thus Jarhead focuses on the preparation for war, the boredom waiting for war, and the irony of fighting a war at the fringe if the action.<br /><br />The film seemed to wish to make a statement about young male soldiers - what makes them tick. In this regard, the film succeeds. The film depicts these young 19 and 20 year old fellows as nieve about the world and yet foolishly cocky. These fellows were under educated and under achievers from rural areas or the inner city. They were not the sons of doctors and lawyers from the suburbs. They were influenced by a substance called testosterone that fuels aggressive blood lust and wild mood swings. They also are subject to the effects of alcohol, which we all know does not mix well with testosterone. Yet, they are also pack driven and eventually fall in line under the direction of an alpha male, played very well by Jamie Foxx in this film.<br /><br />The film also casts a jaundiced eye toward military leadership. These young men were not really prepared for war, despite their bravado. The malfunction of equipment, such as gas masks and communication equipment, was a constant running joke in the film. Those who know just how much tax payers must pay for such useless broken equipment to military contractors realize this is far from a joke.<br /><br />The story or plot involves a group of soldiers waiting to fight, always on the edges of the action, and thus they experience such adventures and finding thousands of burned Iraqi vehicles and charred bodies; or nomads complaining of shot camels; or a desert of black burning oil fields.<br /><br />I think that this is one of those films, like Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, that get better with age and distance. With time the film will be seen as a film about the young male Marine, and not a political statement about our conflicts in Iraq.  The title "Jarhead" should lead us to the real purpose of this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>I didn't have high expectations for this movie because of all the mixed reviews, but I am hungry for HD material so I watched it.  It turned out to be a pleasent surprise-realistic story, good acting, good dialogue.  However, don't expect to see a war movie with lots of combat action-most of the movie takes place during the buildup prior to the Gulf War.  Also, while the boot camp portion of the movie is good, it can't compare to Full Metal Jacket.  The HD DVD transfer is one of the better ones and the sound is top notch as well.  Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5VLIJMDPWHI.html">A2C5VLIJMDPWHI</a><br/><p>I learned long ago to take other folks' opinion with a grain of salt and this movie would be a prime example.  A co-worker told me that this movie was a comedy...there was nothing comedic about this movie after the first 20 minutes. This was a solid, realistic look at how a soldier goes into the military.  It shows how they are broken down and built back up, the mind games the superiors play to get them to follow their commands, the manipulation involved in 9/11, the REAL point of the war (read: gas), how the soldiers had to survive in the desert, and how their relationships were tested in the process.  The branding scenes were a little too much for my eyes, but I thought this was an excellent movie.  The main character in this movie did a great job at playing a decent guy who just needed to learn how the military REALLY works and Jamie Foxx did a great job too.  This was a really, really good movie.  A couple of slow scenes happened during the bombing, but I loved the underlying meaning. Unfortunately, I think it will go over a lot of peoples' head (like the person who told me the movie was a comedy).</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Lean and surreal. Yeah it's been done before but here's one for gulf 90's. Good actors and stunning visuals hold your interest and imagination. Well done.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I absolutely loved this movie, for it stands out from the crowd of generic war films and gives you a sense of realism.  Based on Anthony Swofford's memoir, `Jarhead' stays pretty faithful to it's source and delivers a unique movie going experience that thrives on the brilliant performances of it's cast, in particular Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard.  As Anthony `Swoff' Swofford (Gyllenhaal) learns to adjust to life in the Marines he soon realizes that it's not what he expected it to be.  He doesn't want to be there, he never wanted to be there.<br /><br />On the other hand Troy (Sarsgaard) struggles with learning his reenlistment has been denied at that he must soon leave.  Troy wants nothing more than to fight, but he fears he'll never get the opportunity to engage in the very thing he's trained so hard for.  Both Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard put so much into their characters that the fact both were snubbed of Oscar nominations baffles me.  Especially Peter who quickly became the most sympathetic character in the bunch and the one we felt the most pain for.<br /><br />I've heard this is a very realistic view of what our soldiers go through, a lot of waiting around for something to happen with nothing to do but get close to those around you and pray the ones you left haven't moved on.  It's not your typical war film so don't expect `Saving Private Ryan' or anything like that.  This is a drama about the affect war has on those involved.  The cinematography is astounding, just beautifully shot, and Sam Mendes deserves top notch honors for his brilliant directing.  I'm just really shocked that this movie was overlooked by Oscar.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx does deliver a nice performance if albeit overshadowed by almost every other actor here, especially the aforementioned as well as Lucas Black who delivers the comedic relief in this film.  Gyllenhaal had a killer year with his Oscar nominated performance in `Brokeback Mountain' as well as `Proof' and with each performance he brought something new and something fresh to the fore.  He's definitely one to watch!</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Jarhead is neither a heroic, nor an entertaining war film.  Instead, Sam Mendes employs the ample cinematic brilliance that he also applied in his astonishing films American Beauty (1999) and Road to Perdition (2002).  The characters are far from perfect, as their imperfections emerge throughout the film.  The characters are not depicted as heroes, but like chauvinistic mindless brutes trained for one single purpose - to kill.  The title is also an allusion to this notion, as it refers in slang to Marines through their haircuts, but also the symbol of the head being a hollow container.  The story becomes a journey into a personal hell based on Anthony Swofford's book Jarhead: A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other Battles that capture the indoctrination and transformation to murderous warriors that will serve orders faithfully.<br /><br />The first impression that Jarhead makes is much like a reproduction of several other war films such as Kubrick's brilliant Full Metal Jacket (1987), Stone's bloody Platoon (1986), and Coppola's surreal Apocalypse Now (1979) among many others.  Some of the film's uniqueness seems to suffer from the similarities of other cinematic experiences.  Yet, it is also where some of the films strengths rest, as most people only can relate to war through the movies.  Thus, through the audience's recognition of other war films Mendes reaches all viewers when he makes one of the closing arguments that "Every war is different. Every war is the same."<br /><br />A brief series of scenes portray some of the hard nose training that Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) had to endure, which included demeaning and cruel treatment.  It is some the methods that drill sergeants apply to bring out the hatred and anger needed for a cruel and merciless killing machine.  These images are put in the light of an introductory voice-over that echoes with the thoughtful notion that soldiers will never forget these murderous skills, as they will strive to reap the pleasures of life such as loving and nurturing.  It is obvious that Swofford truly hates it in the Marines, and sees the whole ordeal as a gigantic mistake, as he finds himself under a nasty drill instructor that tries to bring out the worst in him.<br /><br />Angry and troubled Swofford is shipped out to a new location where he meets his new unit, and is put under training as a scout sniper in the US Marine Corps. It is a rigorously harsh and difficult training lead by Staff Sergeant Sykes (Jamie Foxx) whose job it is to weed out the weak.  Swofford finds the snipping business intriguing, and excels, as he becomes partner with Troy (Peter Sarsgaard).  Eventually the training comes to an end, and the first Gulf Conflict commences a short period after the training.  The idea of war makes all of the trigger-happy Marines cheerful that they are about to ship out to face the enemy that they have prepared for through the brutal training.<br /><br />The blissfulness of war soon ceases, as they learn that they will dig into defensive positions while awaiting the war. It is an extremely difficult time for the soldiers, as they find themselves isolated from civilization and the loved ones at home.  As the days run by Swofford and the other soldiers hydrate, eat, masturbate, train, or sleep. In between the daily routine, they find much time to think about life and death.  Swofford thinks about his girlfriend, and how much he wants to be with her.  Meanwhile, his buddies in desert camouflage makes fun of how much they also desire his girlfriend.  However, as the time goes by it becomes apparent through the letters that his girlfriend becomes restless and seeks new friendships.  It is when his insecurities begin a personal war on himself, a war that can drive a person mad.  In a sense, Mendes captures some of the same mystique that Malick's poetic The Thin Red Line (1998) posed, as his soldier desires to get away from the war and enjoy living life and all of its pleasures.<br /><br />As most people should know the war eventually starts, as Operation Desert Storm begins.  It also means that Swofford and his brothers-in-arms can finally do what they are trained to do.  However, it brings the audience through a surrealistic experience, especially when approaching the burning oil wells.  There is one scene where Swofford encounters an oil-drenched horse under the pitch-black sky covered in the sooty smoke.  The scene brings to mind Salvador Dali's painting The Burning Giraffe, which he painted to show his personal struggle with the war in Spain during the 1930s.  Swofford also seems to undergo some personal struggle, as he tries to keep his humanity intact around the death and darkness that surrounds him.<br /><br />Overall Jarhead presents a terrific cinematic experience.  The camerawork is extraordinary through some of its emotionally scaring imagery and its portrayal of the characters.  The lighting also feels scorching with its overwhelming whiteness in the desert day scenes.  Gyllenhaal's personification of Swofford accentuates the psychological war that often is undergone in each soldiers mind in a truthful manner, which also enhances the cinematic experience.  Many of the supporting cast also enhance the emotional predicament that Swofford experiences.  In addition, the small, but meaningful appearances by Chris Cooper and Dennis Haysbert also enhance the overall visual experience.  However, the story is not unique, as already mentioned, and this portion of the film, even though it serves the film well, has an impact on the cinematic experience.  Nonetheless, Jarhead presents a truly intriguing and worthwhile viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A33TBHM3O9AY17.html">A33TBHM3O9AY17</a><br/><p>I rented this one last night, expecting a typical war story.  What I got was something else entirely.  This is the movie adaptation of the autobiographical book of the same name by Anthony Swofford about his experiences in the Marines during the first Gulf War.  As a former military guy myself from that era, I was initially drawn into the story because I could relate to Swofford's introduction into military life at boot camp.  It was a scene familiar to anyone with armed forces experience.  Unfortunately, the movie went downhill from there.<br /><br />As the story traces Swofford's short military career through his garrison time and into Desert Shield, there remains an aura of credibility, although frankly some of the behavior depicted by the servicemen began to stretch the limits of what was believable based on what I knew of military life.  As Desert Shield drags on for months, the focus shifts to the emotional and psychological toll of wartime inactivity, which admittedly is more pronounced among sex-starved young men who know nothing but loneliness and boredom.  Even so, these scenes become exaggerated and even caricatured by the onset of the Desert Storm phase.<br /><br />Finally, the theme moves on to the futility and senselessness of war from the perspective of the average grunt on the ground.  Again, there was some familiarity here for one who had lived through eight years of often nonsensical and contradictory military culture.  However, some of the Marines' responses simply didn't jive with the reality of their circumstances, or reflect fairly on the immense professionalism that characterizes the modern U.S. military, both now and during the early 90s when this story takes place.<br /><br />Oddly enough, for a "war movie" this had almost no violence in it whatsoever.  It is much more of a character study and a psychological inquiry into the nature of young men trained to fight and kill.  It renders an indictment of high-level military leadership which, while true, is also one-sided.  In short, this story offers up heavy doses of both reality and exaggeration, and it is up to the viewer to try to sort out which is which.  For people with military experience that shouldn't be too hard, but others will likely walk away with a distorted view of our armed forces.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KG8WLR1AKO12.html">A2KG8WLR1AKO12</a><br/><p>Am I too easily impressed by Jarhead because I was never a member of the military?  Do those who have actually served find the film to be over the top and a distortion of reality?  Whatever, I can only say that I enjoyed Jarhead immensely.  We sleep peacefully only because such brutal and well trained individuals are guarding our nation.  The concerns of Thomas Hobbes must be resolved long before we can pay attention to the democratic principles of John Locke.  Anthony Swofford's experiences as a Marine sniper during Desert Storm shows the less than perfect humanity of those who kill the sworn enemies of the United States.  These brave men are often vulgar, excessively macho, and rarely politically correct.  They are sent into harm's way by our elected officials.  Do they always understand the purpose of their sacrifices?  No, sometimes our committed warriors are perplexed.  A secular faith in the democratic process is required.  Civilians ultimately make the decisions---and the military must obey.  Swofford and his buddies are ordered to defeat Saddam Hussein's attempt to monopolize the oil industry in the Middle East.  At the end, the dictator is humiliated but survives.  Our politicians decide not to eradicate Saddam's regime.  Might this disillusion the more idealistic Marine? It doesn't matter. A Marine must obey. This is the way it has to be.  Utopia is not possible on this side of the grave.  A democratic society can only do the best it can.<br /><br />There are no weak performances in Jarhead.  The acting is superb.  To an outsider like myself, these Marines seem like the real deal.  Take a chance on this film.  The risk is worth it.  I consider Jarhead to be a five star experience.  Maybe you will agree.<br /><br />David Thomson<br />Flares into Darkness</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>Jarhead follows Jake Gyllenhall through marine bootcamp, through training as a sniper and being sent to Kuwait in the first Gulf War. We watch him get chewed out, worry about his girlfriend cheating on him, fight and party with his marine brothers, go crazy with boredom in the desert and finally get to go on a mission.<br /><br />If all that sounds boring, it is. Nothing interesting happens in this movie. It's 70 minutes into it before the war even begins and then, still nothing happens. Even when he finally gets a mission, it's dull. The scope of this movie tries to be a Full Metal Jacket for the Gulf War generation but fails in the sheer pointlessness of the story.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>I hate war movies. I always have, always will. Having said that, I rarely watch war movies and have never seen such war movies as "Apocolypse Now" or "Platoon". The only reason I saw this movie was because I like Sam Mendes. Sam Mendes is an Oscar winning director (Best Director, American Beauty) and is fairly obscure. He's only directed three movies in 6 years. He carefully picks each film he does and this movie is no exception. The problem is, this movie has been unjustly billed as a war movie and it's not. It's the story of men at war in the Desert. But never do we see battle sequences portrayed in movies like "Saving Private Ryan", "Full Metal Jacket", or even "Cold Mountain". This movie is extremely entertaining, the performances are great, it's funny, and it's probably one of the biggest Oscar snubs of 2005. Hell, this movie is better than "Capote" and "Good Night, And Good Luck". Anyway, the movie is based on a memoir by Anthony Swofford, played here by Oscar nominee Jake Gylenhaal (Best Supporting Actor, Brokeback Mountain). The movie opens with Swofford (or Swoff) in boot camp. The boot camp is instantly reminiscent of the one in "Full Metal Jacket" except R. Lee Ermey doesn't show up and make us laugh our a$$es off. The Boot Camp scenes are entertaining, but short lived. Swoff is transferred to the Camp Pendleton Marine Base where he meets Troy (Peter Sarsgaard, in another underappreciated performance), Kruger (Lucas Black, the kid with the weird accent from "Sling Blade"), Fergus (Brian Heraghty), Fowler (Evan Jones, better known as Cheddar Bob from "8 Mile" who seems to be playing the miltary version of that character), and Staff Sargeant Sykes (Oscar winner Jamie Foxx). Eventually, Swoff and the other men mentioned are transferred to Iraq for Operation: Desert Shield. If you're expecting them to arrive in Iraq and begin shooting Iraqui's left and right, then this isn't your kind of movie. For some odd reason, that's why I like this movie so much. It's a war movie, without being a war movie. Besides the entertainment factors, there's also the political aspect of this film. It couldn't have came out at a better time. This movie takes place when George Bush Sr.was in office, but all the events in this movie could be taking place right now. When Bush Sr. was President, the troops were fighting in Iraq. Now, Bush Jr. is in office and the troops are fighting in Iraq. Do I see a pattern here? Anyway, as I said before this movie is also pretty damn funny. The showing of "The Deer Hunter" scene was hilarious, to me anyways, and the comment Fowler makes in the shower was pretty funny. All the performances are standout; Including Gylenhaal, Foxx, Sarsgaard, Black, and Jones in no particular order. The reason Oscar ignored this film was because it was overshadowed by movies like Capote, Crash, and Brokeback Mountain. Allthough the last two are better movies. Anyway, I highly recommend this movie and it's one of the better films of 2005.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></br><a href="../users/A1Q15TP2FXYYMF.html">A1Q15TP2FXYYMF</a><br/><p>This highly underrated film will come to define the (first) Gulf War in a way that Apocalypse Now defined Vietnam. That is not to say that it can yet be elevated to that lofty status, but that it captures and evokes the time with brutal cynicism mixed with a taste for the surreal in a similar way to Copola's masterpiece. In many ways it also resembles Full Metal Jacket, beginning as it does in the training camp with the anonomous 'jarheads' being put through the paces by a tyrannical drill sergeant. Where it surpasses Kubrick's vision is its ability to translate the process of dehumanisation onto the battle field engagingly, albeit with a more contextual message.<br /><br />Mendes's Jarheads are mere ordinance in a technological war. Trudging across the desert they encounter the burnt-out convoys hit by US laser-guided bombs, its victims anonymous, probably civillian. Their's is a modern war where the enemy is unclear, where the battle is won from the air, and their experience is defined by their never having shot their rifles. It deals with a generation of disenfranchised young men brought up to believe in American superiority but who never had to fight to achieve it. Many will leave unable to consider themselves a hero in a country obsessed by heroism, and some are left, finally, in despair at the seeming futility of it. Having been moulded into testosterone-fuelled, unthinking (hence 'Jarhead'), killing-machines, the war for many of them is one of boredom and frustration.<br /><br />Where the film is really elevated is in its highly stylised vision of the desert, unrelentingly oppressive in stark, unflinching white. Its use of contemporaneous music is also clever, even if one character comments that they don't even have music to define their age in the same way that Vietnam did. Nirvana's 'Something in the Way' accompanies a terrifying dream sequence where Swofford goes to be sick in the mess hall sink, but unleashes a torrent of sand instead of vomit. Equally brilliant is the marines offloading their munitions into the sky to Public Enemy's 'Fight the Power' in an archly symbolic vision of end of the war celebrations. There are many entirely cinematic conceits such as Gyllenhaal's protagonist Anthony Swofford encountering a oil-covered horse in the mecadamised apocalypse of a sabotaged oilfield. This seemingly offers the bewildered Swofford an almost mythological dimension to his experience, but this is soon debased by a drunken party. Swofford often seems on the verge of some kind of epithany but is misguided by the sensless machismo of 'The Core'. This theme is best realised in the brutal irony of the scene where the marines are shown patriotically chanting to Apocalypse Now's famed Ride of the Valkaries helicopter assault, apparently unaware of its subversive connotations and highly seduced by the spectacle of American military might ('Shock and Awe').</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Jarhead" is based on Anthony Swofford's memoir "Jarhead: A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other Battles" about his experiences as a Marine during the Untied States' first military action against Iraq, Operation Desert Storm. The book was considerably condensed and adapted for the screen by William Broyles, Jr., a former Marine himself who served in the Vietnam War. Corporal Anthony "Swoff" Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) narrates the film, beginning in boot camp, when he first questions the wisdom of joining the Marines. In training for the elite STA Platoon, where he will be a sniper, Swoff meets Corporal Alan Troy (Peter Saarsgard), who becomes his friend and mentor. Their platoon, under the command of Marine Staff Sergeant Sykes (Jamie Foxx), is among the first to be deployed in Operation Desert Shield after Iraq invades Kuwait. And so the wait for war begins. Hot, dehydrated, and always anxious about wives and girlfriends back home, the men get stir crazy wondering if they'll ever see any action.<br /><br />"Jarhead" is an exploration of what it was like to be a Marine in a particular place and time. More than any other war movie I have seen, "Jarhead" conveys the tedium of war. Anthony Swofford's platoon saw little action, but what they did see is rendered so visually stunning that it makes a real impression. The fact that there isn't much action allows the film to concentrate on the personalities and relationships of the men of 2nd Platoon. That's not to say the film is dull; it is deftly paced to keep us interested. And the scenes of the Kuwaiti oil wells afire, raining black gold for miles and billowing toxic fumes, are worth the price of the movie alone. Jamie Foxx delivers another strong performance as a man who loves being a Marine, looks forward to a long career, and is sympathetic to the young men under his command but at the same time contrasted to them. "Jarhead" offers some insight into the Marines' lifestyle as well as the frustration of these men who were sent to wait idly to do their jobs and then thrust into a phantasmagory of desert and fire.<br /><br />The DVD (MCA 2006): Bonus features include 3 sets of deleted scenes with optional commentary by director Sam Mendes and editor Walter Murch and 2 full audio commentaries. "Swoff's Fantasies" are 4 short deleted scenes. "News Interviews in Full" (16 ? min) are much longer versions of the press interviews that the Marines give in the movie. And there are 11 miscellaneous "Deleted Scenes". I didn't find much of interest in the deleted scenes, but the audio commentaries are good. The first audio commentary by director Sam Mendes is a detailed scene-by-scene "who, what, and why" of what was included in the film, what was left out, and how the film is structured. This is more about filmmaking than about themes. The second audio commentary is by author Anthony Swofford and screenwriter William Broyles, Jr.  They talk about their mutual experiences in the military as it relates to the film, the film's characters, its structure, and condensing the book for the screen. English captions are available for the movie. Subtitles and dubbing are available in Spanish & French.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>I remember reading a number of years ago in George Orwell's "Homage to Catalonia" that war was a period of intense boredom interspersed with brief intervals of absolute terror.  Such a view would apply to the movie, "Jarhead".<br /><br />Here, we see the military life of Anthony Swofford unfold.  As a somewhat reluctant recruit to the US marines, Swofford (as played by Jake Gyllenhall) manages to be selected as a specialist sniper.  The training period is harsh but does succeed in spitting out trained soldiers at the end.  If these men have one common feature it is that they all wish to go to war.  And George Bush Senior obliges by declaring war on Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait.  The troops can hardly wait.  But wait they must.<br /><br />After landing in Saudi Arabia as a stepping stone to Kuwait, further training continues.  Hopes of war are high amongst the young man.  However, they are destined to train and wait, train and wait.  They are itching to see action but always seem to play a secondary role to the modern war machine that relies upon precision bombs and aerial attack.  The infantry sees little action.  In fact, none of the men in Swofford's platoon gets to fire a shot in anger.<br /><br />"Jarhead" is not a typical war movie.  There is no direct clash between good guys and bad guys.  The viewer is given a far more ambiguous view of war where politics plays a greater role.  As a result, this film differs from the usual Hollywood fare where good triumphs over evil and no questions are left unanswered.  It is this apparent ambiguity that gives "Jarhead" real credibility.  It would have been so easy to fall back upon a formulaic production.<br /><br />I can strongly recommend this film.  The story is one that needs to be told.  The acting is first rate and the scenes of destruction in the wake of Saddam's burning of the Kuwaiti oilfields are absolutely mesmerising.  If only Hollywood could adopt the "Jarhead" approach to other films.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5LA07JCDWTN.html">A2C5LA07JCDWTN</a><br/><p>Even if the author didn't intend it to be, Jarhead is most certainly a backhanded slap at the American military. What makes Jarhead stand out from all other war films is that there is seemingly no war going on for much of the duration of this film. Rather, it is a psychological journey inside the minds of marines who are simply waiting around for their chance to kill something...anything. So whether it be having scorpion death matches, an illegal hootch party or simply wacking off, the tone and tenor of the film never waivers. Its glaicial pacing is vital to preserving the tone of the film. So although, Jarhead is certainly not the best film about war ever made it is certainly unique and original. Sam Mendes continues to challenge the norm with his gutsy directorial choices and although this film is no American Beauty, it is still a fine addition to his resume. Jake Gyllenhaal does a good job as Anthony Swofford, simple, brooding and understated. My only problem with Jarhead is it's resolution or lack thereof. It seems as though the author has chosen to sidestep the most vital issues of the Gulf War for fear of taking sides. This is one of the only films I've ever seen where the author/director have actually gone out of their way to stradle the fence and it's disappointing but alas the good outweighs the bad here.

His gripping book, "Jarhead: A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other Battles," was quickly optioned to be a movie. Where the book captures the fleeting explosions of adrenaline that briefly hits you between countless days of tedium, the film version really loads up the tedium.<br /><br />Really, this uninspiring true-life take on being a soldier may be the most honest take on war ever filmed. There are no heroics. No moments of raging brilliance to stop an enemy. Just hot sweaty men in a desert, scared as hell and maybe bored beyond it. What that translates to is tedious viewing. War is the long stretches of nothing between battles, and these long stretches form the majority of "Jarhead." If you're looking for "Saving Private Ryan," "Platoon" or even "The Boys of Company C," you're not getting any of that here. "Swoff" spends his entire stay in Desert Shield to Desert Storm wondering when he will finally get the chance to use his elite sniper training to make his first kill. The kill that never comes.<br /><br />"Jarhead" comes closest to mimicking the superior "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005ATQF">Full Metal Jacket</a>" in that the drollness of Swofford matches Private Joker in Kubrick's film. But "Jarhead" has no payoff. Theirs is a place where no point of view ever happens...what politics there are in the movie will come strictly from your own point of view. The film itself is visually stunning, I doubt if the scene where oil rains down on Swoff's unit in the night, the desert lit only from flaming oil wells will easily be forgotten, or the horrific "highways of death" recreation. (Google that reference for the background.) Jake Gyllenhaal gives an eerie performance, the emotions bubbling under his facade. (Almost as good as his turn in "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JOFQ">Brokeback Mountain</a>.")<br /><br />But again, I return to the movie's pace and subject matter. It really is too slow and random to be truly entertaining, and yet its lack of any real point of view makes it hard to really dig into the charachters here. Just like Swofford, you spend the duration of "Jarhead" waiting for the time when you finally see some action. The "I am always going to be a Jarhead" ending makes you wish for a deeper explanation as to why.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I thought that this was a pretty good movie and that it was a good adaptation of the book and stayed very true to it. This movie exposes that brain washing and homoerotic culture of the American Military. It also shows the truth behind the everyday life of the basic Marine during desert storm. It might not be what you expect in that the action is few and far between. But it also has a ton of the basic war movie stuff that you have seen in every war movie since The Boys from Company C.<br /><br />Still a good movie and worth watching, check it out!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>There's a lot to love about JARHEAD, but there's an underlying current, too, that may effect some viewers negatively (specifically those that have been or are Marines.) Myself never having been in the U.S. Armed Services, I can't make those glib comparisons that others who've "been there and done that" might be able to. But what I can do is rate this film on its own merits and tell you why I gave it such a high rating.<br /><br />Like Sam Mendes' other film, AMERICAN BEAUTY, which delves into the depths of suburbia and all its great and terrible significance, Mendes here takes hold of a U.S. Marine and shows us an excellent character study. But this time it's of a young man's ultimate genesis into a fighter.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal (DONNIE DARKO and OCTOBER SKY) is Anthony Swofford, a naive recruit with dreams of glory and medals, a dedicated American protector who takes his lumps during his early time in "The Suck" (the Marine Corps unofficial title given to it by the grunts). He rises to the station of a Marine Scout-Sniper along with Troy, Peter Sarsgaard (FLIGHT PLAN and KINSEY). And above them is Staff Sergeant Sykes, Jamie Fox (RAY), who "loves The Corp" and will never leave it.<br /><br />As Swofford makes it through boot camp and into the lower echelon of a Marine trained combatant, he is very willing, ready and extremely able to kill whenever the order comes.<br /><br />But what if it doesn't? This is the crux of the film.<br /><br />I've heard a lot of gossip about JARHEAD before its release, and many have d@mned it for a message that I simply did not see, that being the making of a political statement or "bashing" the Marine Corp. On the contrary, I think Mendes held back on this point and skillfully allows the viewer to insert their own beliefs (if you lean one way or the other - pro-War vs. ant-War). And that's War with a capital "W". Because, let's be honest, that is what our Armed Services are trained for. They are trained to kill during wartime. And each man/woman brings with them their own justifications for this (be it "In protection of my country" or "Because my father was a Marine" or "Because it was this or jail.")<br /><br />This film focuses on the relationship that Swofford develops with the Marine Corp and within himself. He is given the right tools (both psychologically and physically) to exterminate the enemy. He is beat down by his instructors and built back up into a killing machine ("This is my rifle. There are many like it but this one is mine..."). He's loaded with adrenaline as they enter Iraq for Operation Desert Shield. But the days start to drag and he begins to wonder if he'll ever see any action and get to do what he was designed for (sharpshooting). Boredom sets in, and with it comes resentment and anger directed at everyone (even men in his own platoon). But then a mortar attack on their outpost occurs. Slow motion blasts of sand cover Swofford's face, a sort of baptism into the War. He wets himself during this scene, but whether it's from excitement or fear is left up to the audience (I personally loved that part, as it might be perceived as another type of baptism.)<br /><br />Then we see Swofford and his platoon moving into the desert as they witness the burning of the Kuwait oil fields. They go into this muck and the feel of the film turns as dark as the petrol spilling from the infernal wells. Are they in Hell?<br /><br />My initial perception was that something bad was coming. But it never did.<br /><br />There is no "War" to speak of for Gyllenhaal's character. We never see a speck of enemy blood on-screen. No head splatters or bullet-riddled chest shots. The war is "distant", beyond his reach, and you begin to feel his frustration. Why can't he just kill somebody? (This is especially noteworthy when they are given the opportunity but it is quickly taken away.)<br /><br />All in all, this movie is a fantastic break from normal Hollywood form. There are no great external battles with dismembered bodies and the death of half the platoon. The battle here is compartmentalized into one man's struggle to find out what he's supposed to do as a killer when never given the opportunity to become one.<br /><br />(There is a great feel of dichotomy toward the end of the film when an obviously disenfranchised Vietnam Vet gets on-board the welcome home bus carrying the "victorious" Marines down Main Street; a "victory parade" that the Vietnam Marine never got.)</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director: Sam Mendes<br /><br />Cast:  Jake Gyllenhaal, Scott MacDonald, Peter Sarsgaard, Jamie Foxx, Lo Ming, Lucas Black, Kevin Foster, Brian Geraghty, Chris Cooper.<br /><br />Running Time: 123 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for Rated R for pervasive language, some violent images and strong sexual content.<br /><br />Jarhead, as many people know, is a slang term for a US Marine. One of those newly minted jarheads is Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) who, largely to even his own surprise, finds himself enduring the rigors of basic training and then still more brutal training for his assigned specialty. Swoff tells one drill sergeant that he's in the Marines only because he "took a wrong turn on the way to college." His explanation doesn't go over well. Later, he does everything he can think of to drum himself out of the Corps. Eventually, between the friendship and support of his partner, Allen Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) and the tough example set by his commander, Staff Sergeant Sykes (Jamie Foxx), Swoff becomes very, very good at his new job: a scout sniper. Needless to say, when the news breaks that Saddam Hussein has invaded Kuwait, Swoff's group is one of the first to be sent overseas.  The troops are welcomed to the desert by Lt. Col Kazinski (Chris Cooper) who commands a large segment of the Marines deployed there, and who tells them they must maintain constant vigilance and be ready to fight at a moment's notice. But months go by with nothing to do but drills and more drills, and the boredom, anxiety, heat, and desolation of their circumstances begin to wear. The men, of course, find some very creative (and usually very naughty) ways to entertain themselves and each other during this time. But when war is at last declared, they move out like the professionals they've been trained to be.  In the midst of burning oil wells and charred vehicle convoys, Swoff and his company make their way into enemy territory. They endure enemy fire and fear; fights amongst themselves and utter despair. And then, as suddenly as it began, the war is over. But despite the brevity of Swoff's experience (his own fighting war lasts only a little over four days), he and everyone else is changed by their experiences, and not all of those changes are easy to live with.<br /><br />"Jarhead" gives us the firsthand experience of one soldier in the Gulf War with all of the attendant good and bad moments. As such, it's fascinating in and of itself. But director Sam Mendes has added dramatically to the story with some truly brilliant edits, some creatively managed flashbacks, and some astounding settings (the burning oil wells are bizarrely heart breaking even as the depiction on screen is awesome; the destruction wreaked by American bombs is graphic and moving). Of course, the fact that the film is based on a book written by the real Anthony Swofford about his own experiences in the Gulf War means that even Hollywood effects can't take away from the back of our minds that much of what we see is real, or at least was.  Jake Gyllenhaal has become a very good actor indeed, and holds his own with Oscar(tm)-winner Jamie Foxx, whose performance could very well garner him another awards-season nod for his supporting role. Peter Sarsgaard is also just terrific.  "Jarhead" isn't a war movie per se in the sense that it shows a lot of shoot 'em up action, but it may be one of the few war movies that actually conveys graphically the sheer boredom and hurry-up-and-wait that is the reality for many soldiers.  That the men perform so well despite the emotional obstacles of where they are and what they might have to do, and that they're a cohesive group when it counts no matter the flaws of each or any of them, is unquestionably honored here.  Not quite up to the quality of director Sam Mendes's "American Beauty" and "Road to Perdition", but with his first three films, he has solidified himself as one of the most aggressive, intelligent, and thought-provoking filmmakers out there.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>There's some good things about Jarhead - the performances are excellent, the often, crude, absurdist, and back humor really hits its mark, and the recreation of the 1992 Persian Gulf War is generally well done, but the film is ultimately hampered by a lack of a good plot. Under director Sam Mendes' awkward direction, this film about the absurdity of the first Gulf War, which is linked to the absurdity of all wars, struggles hard to maintain momentum and find its feet.<br /><br />Jarhead is Anthony Swofford's 2003 Gulf War battlefield memoir. The central premise of the book was the ultimate irony of going off to war and kill people, but just waiting and waiting. Rather than actually seeing battle, the marines endured the sheer boredom of waiting for a war to happen, of the drinking, joking, lusting, swearing and quarreling of a bunch of adrenaline-charged and testosterones fuelled twenty year-olds, sitting around in the blazing, surreal Arabian desert, wondering, "Are we ever going to kill anyone?" It all becomes rather frustrating, lonely and tedious, and foreshadows a powder keg of pent-up anger.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal plays Swofford or "Swoff," a third-generation enlistee who joins the Marines just in time to go to Saudi Arabia for the war. Signing up for the marines rather than going to college proves to be a big mistake, as Swoff soon discovers that he hates the army. During the harrowing rigors and hazing of basic training, Staff Sgt. Sykes (Foxx), a lifer who loves his job, selects Swoff for his elite unit of scout/snipers.<br /><br />Sykes pairs Swoff with Troy (Peter Sarsgaard), giving him a partner whose calm exterior belies the turmoil inside. Other soldiers in their unit include the intellectually challenged loudmouth Fowler (Evan Jones), extremely shy Fergus (Brian Geraghty), married man Cortez (Jacob Vargas), and stolid Cuban-American Escobar (Laz Alonso).<br /><br />Jarhead's early scenes are probably the best, when the soldiers are beginning their training and the military brass is getting them all psyched up - in one scene they shout and cheer to the aerial battle scene in Apocalypse Now. Their company commander is Lieutenant Colonel Kazinski (Chris Cooper), who pumps up his men with war fever and never allows for disagreement as he toys with the men using military psychology 101 to keep them gung-ho about their mission.<br /><br />The movie's largest section takes place in the vast nothingness of the desert, where everyone digs in and waits ... and waits and waits. With no enemy to fight, conflicts inevitably turn inward. The Marines have a solution for everything, Swoff remarks, but none for losing your mind. Squabbles break out and scorpion fights are staged. Guys rag on each other about what wives or girlfriends are doing back home. The banter and jokes revolve almost entirely around toilet humor, sex and violence, which is funny for a while, but rapidly becomes rather tedious.<br /><br />Without a lack of definable plot, it's a war movie without much going on, Jarhead comes across as being a bunch of scenes strung together, including the Kuwaiti oil-fields going up in blaze, a drunken Christmas party ending in an accidental fireworks explosion, and a scene where Swoff is made to clean out the filthy latrines. However, viewers who like seeing butch, muscled young men sunning themselves in the desert will richly rewarded, and Gyllenhaal looks just fantastic.<br /><br />But the characters, particularly the secondary characters, are ultimately too dumbly portrayed to imbue that much sympathy or leave us with a lasting impression. There's the usual stock war figures, consisting of a wise guy jokester from a small-town in Massachusetts, a loud-mouth Texan, a reserved sensitive white guy from Kansas, and a pudgy Latino homebody proud of his pregnant wife back home in California.<br /><br />Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins create haunting images of the marine's ordeal: The burning oil fields and the black rain falling at night, which reduces the color scheme to yellow, red and black; of Marines digging into the oily sand to make absurd foxholes; of Swoff wandering in a daze through a landscape of charred vehicles and incinerated Iraqis, his boots making white prints in blackened sand. All this images are beautiful yet also unsettling.<br /><br />The movie also does a good job of capturing the irreverent machismo, and Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard are effective in portraying the smart and savvy nature of their characters who grow increasingly disillusioned with their mission. In fact, Jarhead is almost a quasi-war film, to the extent that it admires it's Marine heroes even as it notes their frustration and anger, and it never shies away from showing them in a less than positive light.<br /><br />But the film, probably to its ultimate detriment, never takes a political position. This neutral viewpoint causes the movie to observe intense events in a dispassionate remove without really tackling the greater issues that war raises, that of the futility and brutality of modern warfare and the often misguided politics behind it.

There's nothing like macho and usually morbid Marine Corps humor to get me laughing, and this film offers a great deal of that!<br /><br />This is what I could call a somewhat unconventional war movie.  Most of the film is centered around Operation Desert Shield.  Instead of most war movies where we see charcters trying to accomplish a particular objective(s) while encased in the fog of war, this movie approaches war from a different angle.  It's mostly about the anticipation of fighting was Saddam Insane called the "Mother of all battles" (a battle which, of course, never did materialize).<br /><br />Instead of dodging bombs & bullets, the Marines have to deal with 6 months of tedious drills, getting Dear John letters, worrying about getting Dear John letters, having their nerves frayed by living in close-quarters with others, coping with the harsh desert environment and having to overcome the sheer boredom of it all.<br /><br />The movie does a good job of depicting just how mundane it can be to be a soldier on the supposed "front lines" in this day & age.  The Marine Snipers in the movie were among the first to land in Saudi Arabia, and yet they only get to flirt with actual combat duties.  There is certainly an irony in that.<br /><br />Jamie Fox portrays one of those gung-ho Marine Staff Sergeants who it's easy to poke fun at.  While I was in the Navy there was a running joke that 20 years of sea duty turned men's minds to mush. Sailors start to actually worship the Navy after all of that time deployed, and the military becomes a sort of obession.  Looks like the same sort of thing happens in the other services as well!<br /><br />If you want a "traditional" war movie, this one may not be for you.  One of the scenes, just before the Marines were deployed, showed them watching APOCOLYPSE NOW in a theatre.  I believe that scene was put in to show the contrast between a "dramatic" war movie & what the real-life ordeal of a soldier would be like in Desert Storm.<br /><br /> If you're a fan of military movies in general or if you have been in the military, I believe you'll find this movie to your liking.  It's not a great movie, but it is a curious one.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Anticipation was high for Jarhead, the cinematic adaptation of Anthony Swifford's book of the same name about his experiences as a U.S. foot soldier in the first Persian Gulf War. The reaction to the movie was underwhelming to say the least as critics savaged it and audiences stayed away. Something was definitely in the air as the film also failed to pick up any nominations or awards at any of the important ceremonies (Golden Globes, Oscars, et al). Was the film really that bad or had it just been marketed wrong? Or, was it simply the victim of our current political climate?<br /><br />Jarhead is a film filled with striking images captured wonderfully by director of photography Roger Deakins. For example, Swofford and his platoon come across oil wells burning out of control, oil raining down on them. At night, they continue to burn providing the only light, and coupled with downpour of oil, looks like some kind of nightmarish vision of hell.<br /><br />Critics complained that nothing happened in the movie but wasn't that the point? The first Gulf War was typified by highly trained soldiers ready to kill who, for the most part, did nothing because it was predominantly a conflict fought in the air by extensive bombing that ended the war as quickly as it did. Jarhead encapsulates this notion well in a scene where Swoff and Troy are ordered to sniper two high ranking Iraqi officers and at the penultimate moment when they are given the go-ahead to kill they are ordered to stand down so that an air strike can come in and literally steal their thunder. This scene pretty much sums up the experience for a lot of soldiers over there.<br /><br />Sure, there are the unavoidable comparisons to the boot camp sequences in Full Metal Jacket to the ones in Jarhead but so what? No film lives in a vacuum and those scenes are only a small part of the movie and it soon settles into its own rhythm. The film that Jarhead most lives under the shadow of is Three Kings with its mixture of biting satire and horrific imagery of the madness of war, except that Jarhead ends where Three Kings begins. This is a film about humanity (or, rather the loss of it) and not an epic battle of good vs. evil that perhaps people were expecting. Jarhead is purposely anti-climatic. We won the war but what did we do to win it and why? And more importantly, what were we doing there? By that extension, we should also be asking the same questions about its sequel - one that we are still fighting and paying for.<br /><br />"Swoff's Fantasies" feature four deleted scenes with optional commentary by director Sam Mendes and editor Walter Murch. This is footage of Swofford's inner, fantasy life that was shown briefly in the actual movie but more was actually shot (and even more figured in the book).<br /><br />"News Interviews in Full" features more footage of Swoff and his platoon being interviewed by the media with optional commentary by Mendes and Murch. The director mentions that he let the actors adlib their answers to the pre-arranged questions.<br /><br />Also included are 11 deleted scenes with optional commentary by Mendes and Murch. Of note is a scene with Sam Rockwell who plays Swoff's uncle and is in the Marines. Mendes and Murch do an excellent job of explaining why this footage was cut and are candid in what stuff just didn't work.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by Mendes who didn't want to overthink the camerawork or go for the meticulously staged compositions as he did with his previous movies and instead opted for a looser look with extensive hand-held camerawork. This is a very strong track as he defends his choices and tells all kinds of good anecdotes.<br /><br />There is another commentary track by screenwriter William Broyles, Jr. and author Anthony Swofford. Broyles served in the Vietnam War and so these two war veterans talk with absolute authority about the authenticity of this movie. It's great to listen to Broyles and Swofford - two men who've been through what we are watching.<br /><br />On the Collector's Edition version are included three documentaries.<br /><br />First up, is the "Jarhead Diaries." Mendes provides an introduction where he states his distaste of electronic press kits (finally!) and so he had a documentary crew film more peripheral stuff and gave the actors their own cameras to shoot whatever they wanted. The actors are refreshingly candid about their feelings making this movie as they are going through the actual experience.<br /><br />"Semper Fi" takes a look at four Marines who came home from the First Gulf War and from the current one. Anthony Swofford interviews these guys and has them talk about what their experiences were like over there and what their life is like now. Because he is also a veteran, he is able to get them to open up a bit. These are pretty sobering accounts as we listen to how hard it is for them to just turn off their combat training once they come back home.<br /><br />Finally, there is "Background," a documentary about the extras who played anonymous Marines in the background of scenes. is a fascinating snapshot of their experiences.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>"Jarhead" is a marine expression that describes a recruit as an open vessel waiting to be filled by the commanders that be and by the haircut that makes the marine look like one.  The movie is a recollection of the first Persian Gulf War, told from the point of view of Private Anthony Swofford (who wrote the book, but is played by Jake Gyllenhall) and his trek from marine recruit until the end of Operation Desert Storm.  The war only lasted six weeks, and his contributions only four days, but the process he undergoes is absorbing.  "Swoff" undergoes initiation and later reluctance until he meets his command leader Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Fox) who gets him ready.  His biggest challenge is keeping a fellow marine in check (Fowler, an ex-con) who seems unstable at best and incorrigible at worst.<br /><br />The movie isn't as intense as the most acclaimed war movies, but it isn't less insightful.  We are given a palpable reality.  The scenes show the urgency of missing women, the boredom and agony of anticipation, and the wild comraderie in all its details.  The best scenes are when the narrative focuses on Swoff separate from his brigade and he shares his inner angst.  The dream sequence tells more than any scene and has a surreal stream-of-consciousness effect.  We also get a first-person feel to when they have to play football in the grueling 112 degree heat.  Other revelations are done well, too.  For instance, their frenzy is present when watching "Apocolyse Now".  There's an interview scene where Swoff and others show their reluctance to follow the military's command to keep silence about the downside of being a recruit.  (They're just brimming to tell it like it is.) Later, Swoff gets into big trouble during a holiday party where he shares contraband liquor.  The war itself, for all its brevity, in the movie and in real life, just tells the unvarnished truth.  It shows the war, like any war, in all its mundane horror.  Swoff leaves us with some concrete thoughts about how his experience changed him forever.<br /><br />"Jar Head" is a good movie experience.  It feels genuine.  The performances are fine, too.  Gyllenhall makes the experience authentic, and the supporting cast is believable throughout.  Jamie Fox, in particular, shows an acting range here that makes us appreciate his other contributions.  (His Oscar for "Ray" seems all the more deserving after seeing this film.)  The music and other atmospherics help to create a solid movie--even if it doesn't brim with suspense.  Overall, it doesn't try to sensationalize anything.  (3 1/2-4 stars)</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>"Jarhead" is a war movie not really about war.  Rather, it's about that strange time before war, when young men and boys are trained to kill without hesitation or remorse, when group-think and group cohesion become the goal of every soldier, and when the boredom and tedium of waiting for the enemy to strike can be almost as unnerving and unbearable as the horrors of war itself.<br /><br />The film is based on the true story of Anthony Swofford, a Marine sniper who served in the Gulf War in 1991.  The story begins in 1989, as Anthony is undergoing the grueling rigors of boot camp training.  When Saddam Hussein invades Kuwait, Anthony is shipped off to the Middle East as part of the operation known as Desert Shield, soon to become Desert Storm.  For Anthony and his fellow Marine sharpshooters, it is the waiting that turns out to be the least endurable aspect of the assignment, as they battle the discomforts of life in the Arabian Desert - and often each other.<br /><br />At no time does "Jarhead" pretend to be anything other than the story of one particular soldier in one particular war; we never get the sense that Anthony is supposed to be representative of all Marines at any given time.  As such, the movie eschews politics and philosophy, avoids heavy-handed moralizing and preaching, and refuses to either glorify or denigrate the men who are its subjects.  Instead, it keeps it all life-sized and realistic, showing us how ordinary men cope with the extraordinary life of being a Marine in times of peace as well as times of war.  Writer William Broyles Jr. makes every moment count as each of the major characters confronts some sort of personal demon, although Broyles never overstates the issues or indulges in cheap theatrics or hyperbole.  The men remain complex and real, with each character drawing both strength and weakness from those around him.<br /><br />Director Sam Mendes keeps the scale intimate and the story tightly focused on the interplay between the men, reserving most of the actual fighting scenes for the final act.  The film is filled with memorable moments and unforgettable images that often border on the surrealistic: the boys achieving a near-orgasmic frenzy watching the helicopter scene in "Apocalypse Now;" their stumbling upon endless rows of burned-out vehicles filled with charred corpses of fleeing civilians; oil from set-afire wells raining down from ink-black clouds, turning day into night and covering the earth with a thick coating of sludge and ooze; an oil-drenched horse mysteriously emerging out of nowhere only to disappear back into the vast wasteland of the ruined, darkened landscape.  The film is worth seeing for its imagery alone.<br /><br />Those seeking a traditional war film - one heavily laden with booming artillery and graphic battle scenes - may find "Jarhead" a bit of a slow go at times, but those in the mood for a film about personal relationships set in a military context will find much to celebrate in this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U360OMVQRPUB.html">A1U360OMVQRPUB</a><br/><p>JARHEAD recounts author Anthony Swofford's personal journey through the First Iraqi War of the early 1990s.  Based on his bestselling book of the same name, the movie marches through his experiences from boot camp to the deserts of Iraq, from the uncertainty of being accepted by the Marines to losing his girlfriend to a "Jody" to the harsh realities of civilian losses strewn all around him.  The movie is a hard and unflinching look at that war, and at the men involved in it.<br /><br />Sam Mendes (AMERICAN BEAUTY) directed.  Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Swoff, the principal character, but it's Peter Sarsgaard's protrayal of Troy and Jamie Foxx's no-nonsense approach to Staff Sergeant Sykes that really steal the show.<br /><br />Although off to a rather rocky beginning, with the immediate comparison of Swoff's drill instructor to the one in FULL METAL JACKET, JARHEAD moves quickly into its own rhythm.  The narrative and pacing of the movie is extremely well done and becomes totally hypnotic.  I found myself watching with rapt attention.  Swoff became very real to me, as did Troy.  Jamie Foxx turned in a stellar portrayal of Staff Sergeant Sykes, showing a depth of acting that he isn't often given a chance to do.  He came across as hard, but in one-on-one moments with Swoff, he revealed the dichotomy inherent, I think, in most professional soldiers:  they love what they do, but they're appalled by it at the same time, and even more confused by their love of it.<br /><br />Despite the direction and the acting, though, the substance of the movie seems to be lacking.  The emotion doesn't exactly come out of nowhere at the end, but it definitely goes nowhere.  I know that this is how many of the soldiers felt at the end of that war, but I think it would have helped if we'd gotten to know the characters a little more deeply.  Troy was getting kicked out of the Marines, but why?  Peter Sarsgaard earned a lot of sympathy from me, but I still don't know what he lied about, or why the military felt compelled to kick him out after he was such a good Marine.  That lack of knowledge really hurt at the end of the movie.<br /><br />The HD DVD release offers extremely intense video presentation.  The images are clear and sharp, well-defined.  However, even though the sound separation is done well for surround sound systems, it isn't uncompressed.  With a killer soundtrack laying down the score, the high-def fans willing to buy an enriched product even if they'd already owned a copy of the movie should have gotten that enrichment all the way around.<br /><br />JARHEAD is definitely worth a look from military movie fans, but it's not something that's going to completely satisfy.  Perhaps guys who have actually been over there during the wars will get more out of it, but I just ended up with more questions.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Universal / Region A, B, C<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />VC-1 BD-25 / Advanced Profile 3<br />Running time: 2:02:50<br />Movie size: 21,42 GB<br />Disc size: 22,05 GB<br />Average video bit rate: 15.91 Mbps<br />Number of chapters: 20<br />Subtitles: English SDH, Spanish, French<br />Extras: None<br /><br />DTS-HD Master Audio English 3840 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 3840 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 24-bit)<br />DTS Audio French 768 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 768 kbps / 24-bit<br />DTS Audio Spanish 768 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 768 kbps / 24-bit<br />Dolby Digital Audio English 192 kbps 2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps / Dolby Surround<br />Dolby Digital Audio English 192 kbps 2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps / Dolby Surround<br /><br />******************************************************************<br /><br />Version: International / Universal / Region A, B, C<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />VC-1 BD-25 / Advanced Profile 3<br />Running time: 2:02:42<br />Movie size: 35,89 GB<br />Disc size: 47,47 GB<br />Total bit rate: 39.00 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 27.33 Mbps<br />Number of chapters: 20<br />Subtitles: German, English SDH, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese, Danish, Norwegisch, Finnish, Swedish, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Greek<br /><br />DTS-HD Master Audio English 3843 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 3843 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 24-bit)<br />DTS Audio French 768 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 768 kbps / 24-bit<br />DTS Audio German 768 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 768 kbps / 24-bit<br />DTS Audio Italian 768 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 768 kbps / 24-bit<br />DTS Audio Japanese 768 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 768 kbps / 24-bit<br />DTS Audio Spanish 768 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 768 kbps / 24-bit<br />Dolby Digital Audio English 192 kbps 2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps / Dolby Surround<br />Dolby Digital Audio English 192 kbps 2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps / Dolby Surround<br /><br />#Audio commentary<br />#Swoffs fantasies<br />#Interviews<br />#Deleted Scenes<br />#Jarhead records<br />#Background Info<br />#Semper Fi documentary<br />#My scenes<br /><br />******************************************************************</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>I was reluctant to see this 2005 film.  I had read this 2003 memoir of Gulf War #1 by Marine Private Anthony Swafford and I enjoyed it.  But yet I just couldn't quite imagine it as a film.  That's because there is very little action; it's all about what's going on in the young marine's mind.  But that was the nature of that war.  There was a lot of training, a lot of waiting, lots of boredom, and lots of reporters with microphones and videotape trying to find a story where there was none.  Maybe that's why one of the things I mostly remember from that war was the soldiers playing football in the sun while wearing  full chemical retardant gear.  And this was on a desert where the average temperature was about 112 degrees Fahrenheit.<br /><br />The film got poor reviews but I was still curious.  And that's why I made sure to see it.  I'm glad I did because I found it refreshing, a war movie was about one particular soldier with a voice-over narration of well chosen words.  Jake Gyllenhaal, of Brokeback Mountain fame, is the star.  His wears a  "jarhead" crew cut and a pensive expression most of the time.  We share his anticipation, his disappointments, and his realization that all his expectations have been wrong.  He and his fellow marines have been trained and trained and then over-trained by their sergeant, played by Jamie Foxx.  There is some great surreal cinematography of the unending desert and the landscape of the oil wells aflame while the soldiers do little but come across charred bodies.  There's no heroism and when Gyllenhaal and fellow marine, Peter Sarsgaard finally think they are going to use their sharpshooter skills, their hopes are shattered by a commanding officer who refuses to let them take that shot.<br /><br />There are different kinds of wars.  And Jarhead captures the experience of Gulf War #1 magnificently.</p></br><a href="../users/AS558SNWF1DXG.html">AS558SNWF1DXG</a><br/><p>Or, at least, nobody fought in a conventional sense.<br /><br />Even in anti-war war movies (which is most of them) we're used to getting the big battle scenes, a signature glimpse of the horror that, however eye-popping or momentarily thrilling, will eventually become repellent.<br /><br />"Saving Private Ryan" has its whiplash, surround sound depiction of D-Day.<br /><br />"Full Metal Jacket" has its more-grueling-than-battle boot camp sequence, and its hunt for a sniper in the ruins of Hue City.<br /><br />"Apocalypse Now" has helicopter attacks more beautifully choreographed than ballet.<br /><br />But the new movie about America's first war with Iraq, "Jarhead," is built around the "hurry-up-and-wait" rhythms of combat in a technological age.<br /><br />It's about the forces who stood on their mark in the desert for months - from the invasion of Kuwait in Aug. 1990 to the start of hostilities in Jan. 1991 - to take part in a war that, in the end, lasted just four days and was fought mostly with planes, tanks and remote controls.<br /><br />We see it through the eyes of Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal), a smart-but-naive California kid who joins the Marines and soon realizes he's in over his head. His basic training is gone in a blink (probably to avoid further resemblance to "Full Metal Jacket") and almost immediately, he finds himself serving as a sniper in the Persian Gulf, waiting for Operation Desert Shield to become Desert Storm.<br /><br />In the meantime, he and his comrades are gung-ho, expertly trained, fairly well-equipped, coiled to strike ... and also scared, bored, lonely, frustrated and uninformed. That's a volatile cocktail.<br /><br />The result, as directed by Sam Mendes, will probably divide audiences, especially those hoping for combat scenes (a surplus of which will undoubtedly appear in the movies that spring from the second war with Iraq).<br /><br />This film, however, is slowly, episodically paced; its satire isn't always focused and there's a haziness with some details (did Marines really dig foxholes directly under drizzling torrents of oil?) that left me eager to read Swofford's book.<br /><br />But the movie is usually engaging and occasionally chilling; it gets solid performances out of Jamie Foxx and Peter Sarsgaard, who play career Marines; and its final scene, a montage set against Tom Waits' song, "Soldier's Things," may be a bit too on the nose but it still got me.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, "Jarhead" just isn't the four- or five-star home run it could have been. Though it tries, it doesn't achieve the gritty satirical edge of, for example, David O. Russell's "Three Kings" (which made a statement about the Gulf War *and* told a nifty heist story *and* de-glamorized combat violence). Like its hero, this is a movie that's angry and bound up and takes careful aim ... but never really shoots to kill.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>This movie is not Mash, Catch 22 or All Quiet on the Western Front.<br />They say every generation has a war: here a marine and his fellows in Desert Storm feel cheated<br />for not getting to kill any Iraqi soldiers.<br />The current generation might complain about getting too much<br />killing of Iraqis?<br />The idea that you want your soldiers desiring to fight<br />is probably important, but I found the scenes where<br />the marines were thirsty for blood kind of hard.<br />Somewhere between WWI and now, we have lost<br />something important?<br />I think we need the draft back,<br />because these marines don't seem to represent America<br />and how that country feels about killing.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>Here, in Jarhead, director Sam Mendes has a chance to build on some of the hate and distrust for the Marine Corps which he constructed previously in his overrated blockbuster American Beauty. It's not a pretty sight, and one would think, based on the psychological instability prevalent within Swoff's platoon, that these soldiers had spent four years fighting on the Eastern front instead of four days in the Middle East during Desert Storm. That these fellows underwent the type of ungluing they did, based on such a short period in action, is incredibly unlikely, and, to do so in such a uniform fashion, defies belief. When contemplating the madness of these characters, the fact that they all graduated from high school, let alone avoided placement in a special education program for the emotionally disturbed, is astonishing. Overall, I completely doubted the veracity of this story.<br /><br />The attempt to portray the entire company as a group of blood-thirsty zealots, who whoop and holler as a village gets destroyed in Apocalypse Now, was actually quite offensive. I really think that these negative stereotypes are put forth as a means to defile the USMC, who stand guard over our safety regardless of the way in which Hollywood demeans them. A good bit of propaganda is also included in the allusion to the fact that everything done in Iraq was due to our lust for oil. This is patently ridiculous. Our government is the richest entity on this earth and they're not concerned about how much their citizens pay for gasoline. They could care less, yet this was just another way to delegitimize the presence of the Marines on the peninsula which was probably the purpose for making the movie in the first place.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>Jaky Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain, Highway) stars as Anthony Swoffard who is in the deserts of Saudi Arabia where he is being trained by Sgt. Sykes played by Jamie Foxx (Ray, Collateral), to get ready for the on coming war. Swofford becomes a sniper and his spotter is Troy, played by Peter Sarsgaard (Skeleton Key, Shattered Glass). Darkly funny and some scenes with power make JarHead interesting and the direction is amazing, be it explosions or soldiers walking along burnt cars or oil fields at night on fire with is scary and beautiful at the same time. Also starring Chris Cooper (Capote, October Sky), Jacob Vargas (Nexy Friday, Traffic), Lucas Black (Crazy In Alabama, Sling Blade) and Dennis Haysbert (Tv's 24, Absolute Power) They got refrences from The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now and Giant with James Dean. Gyllenhaal gives one of his best performances so far, Sarsgaard is explosive and Jamie Foxx digs out of the BOMB pit that was the movie Stealth. "Welcome to the Suck!"</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Sam Mendes has made two other films, both very fine and very different: "American Beauty," an evisceration of American Society and "Road to Perdition," a `30's-era film about family, fathers and revenge. Both films have strong emotional centers and defined points-of-view both things that Mendes' latest does not.<br /><br />"Jarhead" is about Anthony Swofford (a detached Jake Gyllenhaal) and his experiences training for/being in and living through Desert Storm. There are the requisite scenes of Marine camaraderie, tough drill sergeant stuff and basic guy-to guy humiliation. And these scenes are humorous at times and sometimes not.<br /><br />The problem with "Jarhead"is that, at its core it is empty and more damaging...it is often boring. Once Swofford and his company arrive in the Middle East, it's a lot of waiting, more training and even more training. And when it finally dawns on us that there will be no actual combat...that Swofford will never actually aim and shoot his rifle at an enemy, we are more than ready for the ordeal to be over.<br /><br />Most of the performances lack energy and this we can only place on the shoulders of Mendes for Gyllenhall, Jamie Foxx and the formidable Chris Cooper have been excellent elsewhere. The only palpable energy is generated by a showing, to the company of Marines, of the helicopters swooping down onto a Viet Nam village scene to the strains of the "Ride of the Walkueres" in Coppola's "Apocalypse Now": an unfortunate reminder of how a war film should be made.<br /><br />Though beautiful to look at because of Roger Deakins's gorgeous, evocative camerawork, "Jarhead" is like a beautifully wrapped gift when, upon untying the bow, you find the box sadly and forlornly empty.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>This movie proves to be a definite improvement over the book, only because the excessive sniveling have been limited due to the interest of the movie. If this' an one man's view of his experience in the Marine Corps, its a pretty sad one at that.<br /><br />In Swofford's experiences, the US Marine Corps proves to be nothing more then but pronographic loving, lewd mannered sniveling jarheads who survived Operation Desert Storm only because their Iraqi enemies were even more weaker then they were. But this is one man's view and he wasn't a very happy Marine for sure. It pretty hard to called this a "war movie" since it really wasn't much of a war. The self-inflicted stress and trauma these Marines on screen suffered from were home sickness, boredom, losing their girlfriends and wives to guys at home and lack of enemies to kill. I am sure that the veterans of Vietnam, World War II and Korea wishes their stress and trauma were that terrible as well.<br /><br />The movie overall, however, appears to be well produced, directed and acted. Jake Gyllenhaal does a pretty good job playing the main sniveler, Swofford. Swofford proves to be an interesting character because despite of all the whining he does on screen, he still tries to do his duty the best he can. Jaime Foxx also shine as well as Swofford's squad leader and the movie appears to be well supported by fine acting.<br /><br />However, if you watch...let say...Saving Private Ryan prior to watching this movie, you will probably feel a great deal of contempt toward the whining Marines of this movie. And if not, you will still feel like questioning if this is the ideal model of "the few and the proud" Marine Corps material. I hope not!</p></br><a href="../users/A29SJTG21BVWF4.html">A29SJTG21BVWF4</a><br/><p>Although this movie has gotten a lot of good reviews.  I find that it is bland and unmoving.  However, I am not a soldier or a veterian.  Military framilies will be able to apricate this movie a lot more than the general public.  But I find that it was still intreging enought to be an enjoyable movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This is a pretty good movie, it makes me not want to join the army, espcially the way they were treaed. it's a pretty good movie. thats all i can say.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Call me old-fashioned, but a good story needs three components:  a beginning, a middle, and an end.  Leave out any one of the three, and the recipient of the story--even though he or she may be impressed by the authenticity, grit, and determination of the components portrayed--walks away from the experience with feelings of ho-hum indifference, at best.<br /><br />Such is the case with director Sam Mendes' JARHEAD ("High and tight, Soldier, high and tight!").  This movie depicting a Marine Corps unit's adventures during the 1991 Gulf War has a solid beginning, when we are introduced to several characters as they crawl and grunt through basic training before deployment to Arabia; and it has a middle, the subsequent "waiting game" the soldiers must endure prior to conflict--waiting that entails boredom, hydration, fighting amongst themselves, hydration, lamenting when their wives or girlfriends in the States dump them, hydration, going desert bonkers, and more hydration.  And then. . .nothing.  The unit marches through a barren wasteland, punctuated by burning oil wells belching hellfire into the sky, yet never encounters an enemy to engage.  Before a shot can be fired, the war is over; the unit gets shipped back home.<br /><br />There's no ending.  Granted, there is an "ending," but nothing to make us wonder, understand, or even give a darn why we were subjected to the antics of this bunch of soldiers--other than an underhanded agenda to gig the Marine Corps (duly noted by the narrating character).<br /><br />JARHEAD is a well-made, very visual, often intense film.  Lead character Jake Gyllenhaal turns in a gritty, sometimes over-the-top performance, and he's complimented very aptly by Peter Sarsgaard, Lucas Black, and several other young actors.  Jamie Foxx gets tapped on the shoulder to portray the stereotypical staff sergeant who yells and barks and admonishes and punishes and so on.  Mendes shows us the dirt, grime, sweat, comedy, drama, fear, insecurity, and immaturity of a group of males little more than boys out in the desert, augmented by an absolutely fantastic musical score; but he doesn't give the viewer an ending to match the story so diligently put in place.  It's dry.  I'll have a bottled water.<br /><br />--D. Mikels, Author, WALK-ON</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Sam Mendes' account of the Gulf War, based on the memoirs of the same title, is as hollow and empty as his much overrated `American Beauty.' By the word `hollow' I am not trying to describe its content or story which avoids the clich&eacute;s of the war films. The biggest and fatal flaw is that the sneering attitudes of `Jarhead' about the characters it describes.<br /><br />You don't need any minute summery of the film. It is about one soldier's look on the war, which could be different from the other soldiers', or could be just the same. Though I haven't read the book, it is clear that the film thinks it important to keep the touch of the first-person account of the Gulf War written by former Marine Anthony Swofford. At least I thought so in the first half of the film, which is devoted to the descriptions of the marines' boring and almost aimless life in the desert, just waiting for the war. Well, I have never been in the Marines, but it looks real.<br /><br />But as the film goes on, I started to doubt. I do not hate the film because few things happen in the film (because that is exactly the point of the film). On the contrary, too many things happen in it, all of which attempt to give an emphasis upon the emptiness of the war and the life of the Marines. If marines would hate the film because of the negative images of them with crude and immature behaviors, it is understandable. You would keep thinking, either amused or disguised, "Is this reality?" You never know, because this is after all the first-person account, but the film's real problem lies behind that.<br /><br />In spite of the strong acting (I agree reluctantly) from Jake Gyllenhaal as Swofford, the characters in the film look like amalgam of many exaggerated traits of the Marines. Look at Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) the `spotter,' who can keep cool at various trying experiences in the desert, but suddenly blows it at the moment when he is denied one thing - killing. Look at Staff Sgt, Sykes (Jamie Foxx), mouthy stereotype who suddenly speaks (briefly, as usual) of his background before the burning oil well. Mendes means something profound in these scenes, but what we see is typical war film formula that could have been more effectively done with better hands like Samuel Fuller who really went to war. And behind all of the negative images you can see the sneer of the director who really doesn't believe in anything, who doesn't care the characters even if they are based on t the real-life people.<br /><br />But after all, what kind of film, whether it is about war or suburbia, can we expect from Sam Mendes, who is a master of cynicism? It is beautifully shot cynicism, but cynicism never believes in anything good in humans. And it is always afraid of finding some merit in what it is sneering at.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>I dotn really like war movies but I did like We where soliders and some other ones but I am nt a fan of them. Right when this movie came out I knew it would be bad and not good but people said it was good and some people said it was bad so i ahd to see and I was right it was bad. The story shows the bad parts of joing the army and how people lose loved one's for example the men all think there wives are cheating on them and they lose there wives as they have affairs and then they take there children away. The movie shows how you become brainwashed into fighting while your out in the field and sometimes nothing happends liek this movie and then they show how the men get all mad. The acting was the only good part of the movie the story boring the directing bad for an ocsar winner. Overall dont waste your time you'll be wondering where my 2 hours went.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I am not a huge fan of war movies in general.  I find them all too often rather boring and redundant.  I know that they have a huge fanbase but I just never found myself in that select group.  I have enjoyed a few to an extent, but in general, if it's going to be a war movie, I much prefer the kind that involves bows and arrows and spears and armor, not guns and tanks.  I think that it is my predisposition to war films that actually made `Jarhead' stand out to me as so well done.  It is far from your typical war movie, mostly because the war is not a major character in the film.  It is more a haunting enigma that hangs over the heads of every character in the film, a hushed secret that keeps eluding them the more they desperately reach out for it.<br /><br />Anthony Swoffard is reaching pretty high.<br /><br />`Jarhead' is based off of the memoir written by Swoffard.  I have not read the book, although I hear that it is fantastic.  It chronicles (as does the movie) the action, or lack there of, that takes place while these young men train to kill.  What I loved so much about this film is that it really captures that desperation, that longing for purpose that these young men go through while separated from all they know and love.<br /><br />Not too long ago I was on a cruise with the wife and we were talking with the other couples at our dinner table (whom we had never met before), one of which was on leave to get married and was going to be returning to active duty overseas.  During our conversation he commented that a lot of the soldiers he knew, young soldiers, were there for the `thrill'.  We collectively (at least the men at the table) agreed that a big draw for young ones to join the army is to get to try in real life what they spend hours doing in videogames.  Even the `Army Now' campaigns on television focus on the action, the fighting, the `thrill'.<br /><br />`Jarhead' exposes the reality behind that `thrill'.<br /><br />Thanks to some very competent performances, `Jarhead' becomes impeccable.  I have raved and then bashed Gyllenhaal in my reviews and in conversations.  He has talent, he just doesn't always capitalize on it.  This same year he did `Proof' and `Brokeback Mountain'.  In my initial review for `Brokeback Mountain' I raved Gyllenhaal, but after subsequent viewings I realized how `out of place' he seemed at times.  In `Proof' (which I have yet to review) he is just forgettable.  In `Jarhead' he is marvelous.  There is a quality to his eyes that portray an almost confused curiosity, as if he wants to know more but is afraid of what he'll learn.  He conveys that so well here.  Jamie Foxx also steps up his game by sinking into what could have been a generic and clich&eacute;d character and giving him a little extra life.  The slew of supporting actors, not the least of which is Lucas Black, really bode well with the film and its purpose and deliver exceedingly well.<br /><br />But, if you have read the four reviews that preceded this one you will know that this review was inspired by one man and one man alone; Peter Sarsgaard.<br /><br />This is my favorite performance by Peter and truthfully one of the best supporting performances of this past decade.  He has such power and control and dynamic character development.  What is so wonderful about this performance is that he truly plays `supporting' very well.  Throughout the first two thirds of the film he almost disappears behind the man that is Gyllenhaal, allowing the film to really root in Swofford's character.  He makes a statement, sure, and he becomes that secondary character you want to learn more about, but he never crosses that line with showy actorly acrobatics.  And then the sniper scene comes and this man crumbles and I was literally BLOWN away (seriously, best single sequence of acting in the year that was 2005).  Everything that he has been gradually building up to just unloads in a single breathtaking scene.  This mans entire existence shatters and leaves us with a devastating climax.<br /><br />Sam Mendes is a director who I really have a lot of respect for.  He has gotten a bad rap for winning the Oscar so soon (first film, `American Beauty') but his following films have proven his talent.  While `Road to Perdition', `Jarhead' and `Revolutionary Road' all have there drawbacks (`Jarhead' doesn't really have one for me, but I understand why others find it less than rewarding, especially if they were expecting a generic `war' movie) they also exude a distinct knowledge of subject by Mendes.  He understands how to create something that titillates the senses (`Perdition's' rain soaked sets, `Jarhead's' sun cloaked bodies, `RR's' rooms bathed in white)  but also delivers a profound blow.  I think that for a young director he has built for himself quite the resume (I still have not seen `Away We Go', but as per usual with Mendes, it has its raving and its scathing reviews).<br /><br />If you are looking for something that is less typical and more thought provoking; less generic and predictable and more emotionally investing then I highly recommend you seek out `Jarhead' immediately.  If you are looking for your average `blow `em up' type war film then stay far, far away.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>Hate the war but love the soldier...or at least try to understand how good men can willingly be turned into killers who will shoot whatever they are told to.<br /><br />Jarhead seems to move back and forth between pointing out how the military is designed to create mindless, order-following killing machines, and then examining soldiers' frustration at not killing anyone. The scene with them cheering the battle scenes in Apocalypse Now is ironic in the extreme.<br /><br />The narrative moves well, even during the war-is-hellish-boredom parts. What lifts this film to a higher level are Gyllenhall's excellent performance (along with Foxx and most everyone else) and the stunning cinematography of the second half.<br /><br />The flaming oil fields and their resultant chaos are grippingly weird, making a strong but silent point about why we send our kids to die halfway around the world for the benefit of rich old men who don't give a damn about them. This film succeeds when it lets you get inside the heads of certain characters who have stopped thinking but can't stop feeling; it rarely judges the soldiers, instead showing their humanity and confusion when turned into automatons.<br /><br />My father was in the military, and he made me promise never to enlist, saying, "Their goal was to make me stop thinking completely. If we thought about it, why would we want to kill fathers and brothers and sons who are just like us, but born somewhere else?"<br /><br />Thus the term "jarhead"; the jar is emptied of Christian compassion for every one of God's children, and refilled with bloodlust.<br /><br />This is a much more subtle film in many ways, despite its graphic nature, than most reviewers here want to accept. The scene with the horse is absolutely perfect, saying so much with a simple, heart-breaking picture.<br /><br />Life isn't always "you're with us or against us"; sometimes it's "you're with us until we don't need you any more." Jarhead does a good job of making that and many other points.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>Jarhead (based on the 2003 best selling book by real life marine Anthony Swofford) is a haunting war film, but with a twist. When I say twist, I don't mean in a Sixth Sense sort of way. This is entirely different, and for those who followed Desert Storm as it was happening, it probably won't come as a twist at all. While I don't really want to go into the logistics of the direction this movie takes, I will say that Jarhead is more of a soldier's story than an all-out war picture.<br /><br />In this dramatic and often darkly funny offering from American Beauty and Road to Perdition director Sam Mendes, Jake Gyllenhaal plays Swoff, a confused twenty year old who enlists in the Marines during Desert Storm because he more or less has nothing better to do. After rigorous training, Swoff quickly bonds with his fellow soldiers who gleefully refer to their military endeavor as "the suck." Perfectly fitting given where these men are headed. And where Desert Storm takes them is one of the most interesting aspects of this truly original look into a side of war you may never imagined.<br /><br />Sam Mendes likes to make complicated films about complicated people and Jarhead is certainly no different in that regard. As a result, this film will most certainly divide audiences. Why? That isn't an easy question to answer, but for starters, I have no doubt that there will be some who are offended by the idea that the men involved in the "Police Action" of Mendes' film suffer similar fates to those who have fought in bigger more romantic wars. But in a way, that's the whole point of this movie. War is hell regardless of the size of the battle.<br /><br />There are several moments of undeniable power in the film, none more so than a moving sequence in which a Vietnam Vet welcomes a bus full of Marines home from Desert Storm. This particular scene is made all the more powerful because of the vastly different wars these men have been involved in.<br /><br />The marketing campaign for Jarhead is slightly deceptive. From the get go, Mendes sort of baits the audience into thinking that they know exactly where this movie is headed. As the film opens, we are even treated to a sequence in which an abrasive, gung ho drill sergeant practically beats (literally) the rules of war into Swoff's head, in what could be best described as an ode to Full Metal Jacket's bigger than life R. Lee Ermey. The war film references don't stop there. There's also nods to the likes of Apocalypse Now and Deer Hunter (a film I will never be able to watch in the same way again after seeing the way it's used in Jarhead) and the movie does have a tone that recalls David O. Russell's Three Kings, but Mendes ultimately takes Jarhead in a much different direction. The irony is, that while the journey itself is different, the outcome is virtually the same.<br /><br />Given that Jarhead revolves around the war theme, and more to the point, those who fight in a war, it may come as a surprise that the movie isn't necessarily anti-war or pro-war. It's somewhere in between. Jarhead isn't so much a political statement as it is a unique glimpse into a side of war that I've certainly never seen depicted in a film.<br /><br />Anchoring the movie is Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko) who continues to mature as an actor with each passing performance. His Swoff is a compelling young man with layers upon layers of complexity, and Gyllenhaal is dramatic, vulnerable and extremely lively in the role. The rest of the cast is stellar. Peter Sarsgaard (Kinsey, Flight Plan) is extremely effective as Troy, the voice of reason in the field. Every time things begin to get out of hand, Troy is there to rectify the situation. Jaime Foxx lends his usual likable demeanor chewing up the scenery as an energetic sniper platoon leader. The rest of the actors who make up the sniper platoon are perfectly cast (they include Sling Blade's Lucas Black), and all are given a chance to shine individually, but it is the way they play off one another that really make the film tick. This cast has genuine chemistry. They truly come across as a brotherhood.<br /><br />As Mendes films go, Jarhead didn't leave the same impression on me that American Beauty and Road to Perdition did., but it's still an exceptional film and takes this particular genre in to uncharted territory. It's well acted, well written, and well shot, and even though it's completely different than I thought it would be, I admire and respect it for it's patience and it's unique vision. While Jarhead may be about the "suck," I'm happy to report that it doesn't suck at all. It is yet another masterful title on Mendes' small but impressive resume.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VE83MZF98ITY.html">A2VE83MZF98ITY</a><br/><p>The film 'Jarhead' is based on a book of the same name by by Anthony Swofford; both the book and the film are bound to make some people angry. A Marine sniper (STA) during Desert Storm I in the early 1990s, he recounted his experiences there with vivid emotion, weaving in his experiences of boot camp, adolescence, and civilian life after the Corps in the process. This is now a major motion picture chronicling many aspects of his story, with significant differences.<br /><br />It was apparent in the book, and carries over to the film that Swofford has a chip on his shoulder - something he'll most likely readily admit. He has a 'bad attitude', and in fact revels in it. One wonders if this is a product of his war experiences, his Marine Corps training, or his upbringing. At one point his mother, who never really liked the idea of her son being in the Marines, but who wouldn't stand in her son's way, said 'I lost my baby boy when you went to war.' She described Swofford as being sweet and gentle prior to that, and angry and unhappy afterwards. One wonders how much of a change is there - if one can take the stories at face value, this is the same boy who had a fist-fight with his father over going in the Corps at the age of 17, and who had Marine Corps decals put on his shirts as a child. One of his drill instructors even gave Swofford what he considered a great compliment - 'you'll be a great killer someday.'<br /><br />I make the caveat that one might not be able to take all of this at face value, because like many men in this kind of situation, Swofford is likely to exaggerate - making some pieces more dramatic and other pieces less so. Swofford recounts many tales of men in his sniper platoon who had adjustment problems after the war; one can but wonder if that is true for Swofford, too. Also, Swofford admits to being willing and able to lie if the cause is, in some internal sense, justified - his dealings with brother, in the Army in Germany who later died of cancer, is a case in point.  Then we have the 'made in Hollywood' aspects of the film that mean this can be no documentary, but has to be dramatised.  In fact, truth is probably stranger (not necessarily better or worse) than what is portrayed on the screen.<br /><br />Regardless of the details which may or may not be completely true (and, as with many autobiographical pennings, some of the details are necessarily changed), the emotion certainly is. Perhaps the strongest point that comes across is a sense of disappointment and cynicism - that Swofford has ideals and goals is not at issue, although he does downplay these (he doth protest too much sometimes); but his experiences in the Corps and in the war were not what he dreamed. He mentions at various time the recruiting posters and campaigns - while it is true that Marine Corps never promises an easy life (quite the opposite), rarely does one learn prior to entry that one might end up being on the stirring end of the latrine clean-up detail; of human-refuse dump ablaze and blowing all over the place.<br /><br />Just as in the book, the film gives one a sense of some of the problems that the 'average' grunt faces in combat situations. This war was very different from Vietnam, of course, but some of the issues are the same - interminable waiting, equipment malfunctions (if it isn't just plain missing), fear and bravado in a strange mix, questioning and ambiguity as to the value of the war, the cause, and even their own lives. The Desert Shield/Desert Storm situation is reflected in the page numbers of Swofford's book and the timing of this film - a lot deals with the Desert Shield portion, the hurry-up-and-wait aspect; surprisingly little time is spent with Desert Storm itself, as it was on and over so quickly, relatively speaking.  There is a lot of psychological drama in this film in the waiting aspect; there's also a strong undertone of the absurdity of war.<br /><br />Stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Anthony 'Swoff' Swofford, Jamie Foxx as Sgt. Siek and Peter Sarsgaard as Troy do an excellent job in their respective roles.  Foxx turns in a really good performance, and this must be the year for Gyllenhaal.  Director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition) takes a tough book and turns it into a tough film, which is not going to replace a film such as 'Full Metal Jacket' or 'The D.I.' for quintessential Marine film, but will most likely in get top billing among many for the portrayals and situations, especially some of the more bizarre and incomprehensible bits.<br /><br />Again, while there is undoubtedly exaggeration here, and one must take some of Swofford's tales with a grain of salt (or, perhaps sand), there is realism and truth in the feelings these situations engendered. I can understand the anger of Marines and other military who read the book and will see the film and feel a sense of betrayal, but I can also understand those who feel that Swofford is saying what others can't or won't say. This is a tough product.  While I would never want the Marine Corps or military to be judged by this one thing, it is a perspective worth including in the overall mix. Snipers have a reputation for being a bit on the fringes anyway, and Swofford's story in that regard is very true to form.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed the performances by Peter Sarsgaard and Jake Gyllenhaal. Even Jamie Foxx deserves credit for the work he did in Jarhead.<br /><br />I do not normally like Jake Gyllenhaal. It is not that I dislike him at all, in most of his roles I have simply found him unremarkable. He brought a passion to Jarhead that he has not had the ability to display in previous movies. He has come a long way since Bubble Boy.<br /><br />I like Peter Sarsgaard. I have liked him in pervious parts and I appreciate the complexity he brought to the character in Jarhead.<br /><br />Not too long ago I could be heard requesting the end of Jamie Foxx's 15 minutes of fame. More often than not he plays a relatively transparent character and he does little, if anything, to bring the parts to life. (Granted, I have not seen Ray, so I am speaking only of his other work.) If he continues to bring the maturity to future characters that he brought to Jarhead, I will gladly eat my words.<br /><br />I liked the way Jarhead, in a subtle fashion, portrayed different types of Marines. The movie primarily featured the enlisted son of a proud veteran, the cowboy Marine who can't wait to kill anything and everything, the man with the haunted past trying to lose himself in the Marines, and the firm-but-fair, almost fatherly, commanding officer. There were many other men and women who fought and participated bravely in the war, but these characters were the focus of the movie.<br /><br />I liked two main themes/symbols from the movie. I found it very interesting the way the movie suggests that soldiers are coached on how to address the press when expressing their opinions on the war. I also enjoyed the contrast in one of the final scenes as the veteran Marine joins the young men on the bus. This scene was brilliant in its awkwardness.<br /><br />(I was a little disappointed by how similar boot camp experience with the drill sergeant was to the beginning of Full Metal Jacket, but it may not bother you at all.)<br /><br />I approached Jarhead very objectively and found myself very pleased with the movie. I had no expectations, lofty or otherwise. I was able to enjoy the movie for what it was. The language and some subject matter may make the movie prohibitive to a younger audience, but I believe Jarhead is an important movie for the respect and appreciation of our armed forces.</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>Since we all know what choreographed horse-dung most "reality" shows are these days, it is downright refreshing to watch a movie that skillfully conveys a time, a place, and a group of people as well as this film captures Gulf War One.  You remember, the time we actually won, actually GOT "Mission Accomplished" with barely a few scratches (well, ok there were a few hundred casualties but 90% by accidents, friendly fire or by the one Scud missile that hit an Army barracks).  Yes, THAT war---led by the elder Bush not his idiot son, and where our troops were truly greeted as liberators.<br /><br />Problem was, for the boots on the ground, Gulf War One was really one long tedious slog leading up to a total anti-climax.  The only American combat personnel to really see much action were the air force, who did most of the work ahead of the ground forces.  Oh, were all wars for oil so easy and painless!  Sam Mendes, director of the highly acclaimed "American Beauty," does a fine job of capturing exactly what that experience was like, mostly from the perspective of a brighter-than-average 20 year recruit played by Jake Gyllenhaal, a slightly absurdist anti-hero who quickly regrets his decision to volunteer which he later describes as, "I got lost on the way to college."<br /><br />Yes there are allusions to other classic war movies, and there are a number of parallels with the movie that the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr correctly called "the greatest war movie of all time:" Stanley Kubrick's masterful "Full Metal Jacket" which this movie predictably cannot match.  Yet it is far from a failure, as some reviwers have claimed---Mendes has achieved enough clout and independence as a filmmaker to not have to pander to the lowest common denominator audience's eternal desire for easily recognizable good guys, bad guys, and uplifting endings.  What we get instead is a vivid and generally very entertaining portrait of men trained and then thrown into a war that actually wasn't much of a war.<br /><br />Mendes certainly does share some subtle anti-war sentiments, but that does not prevent him from admiring the devotion that men develop for their fellow soldiers, which is the one thing that keeps them in battles that they often know are totally absurd and unnecessary, and keeps them from rebelling against commanding officers, generals and politicians who usually have far more ego than intelligence.  He also does a fine job of exposing the viewer to the very unglamorous realities of military daily life and military culture and the animalistic group dynamics that develop between young men thrown together into that type of environment.<br /><br />So those viewers looking for a nice kiss-the-flag exercise in sentimental patriotism will surely be disappointed, as will those violence junkies hoping to see some satisfying combat scenes---there really aren't any.  Mendes goes to great pains to NOT commercialize or cosmetize violence, and this is perhaps the reason why he has been accused of making a "cold" and "distanced" film in some quarters.  For instance, he chooses to show us the charred and smoking aftermath of the "Highway of Death" massacre in which US aircraft slaughtered thousands of Iraqis fleeing Kuwait ahead of the American invasion instead of the actual massacre itself.  What many viewers and reviewers seem to overlook is that in this day and age, with our modern air-based weaponry, much of war itself IS very much "cold" and "distanced"---at least the wars that we still win quickly and convincingly.<br /><br />"Jarhead" is most enjoyable if you have some appetite for dark and absurdist humor, and do not insist that every movie have the same predictable Hollywood 3-act plot lines and focus-group hooks.  Yes there are a few somewhat clunky moments but there are also some exquisitely bittersweet ones, such as when a Vietnam USMC vet hops on the homecoming bus for the returning soldiers and tries in vain to bond with them.  A Steven Spielberg or other such director would not have been able to resist turning that into some tear-jerking, crowd-pleasing ending---Mendes has the cojones and the artistic integrity to just tell it like it is, even if the audience would much prefer to get their rocks off through the usual tricks and cliches.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Some films work more effectively on a visceral level than a logical one, and this 2005 film adaptation of U.S. Marine Anthony Swofford's 2003 biting memoir is one of them. Chronicling the author's time from boot camp through the brief 1991 Gulf War, director Sam Mendes fills his sometimes blackly comic film with brutalizing images that give it a consistently propulsive urgency. Written by William Broyles Jr. (who had wartime duty in Vietnam as a pilot), it is not really a combat film as the focus of the story is the incessant waiting that the ground troops endured before realizing the conflict was over almost as soon as it began. Mendes and Broyles have us look at the preparation for the ground war within an episodic structure that keeps everything at arm's length emotionally. Moreover, they borrow liberally from previous military-themed films - not only obvious references to scenes from Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket" and Brian DePalma's "Casualties of War" but also paeans to the group dynamics in WWII-era movies with each of the Marines representing familiar wartime archetypes.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the fresh-faced Swofford and does an admirable job here as he outwardly expresses his enthusiasm, especially when he gets chosen to be a surveillance sniper, but inwardly has gnawing misgivings about his tour of duty. His becalmed voiceover is what ties the loose connective tissue of the story, as well as the constant punishment Swofford receives from his superiors, including a humiliating demotion from lance corporal to private for covering an act of false bravado by a fellow recruit. Peter Sarsgaard plays Swofford's scouting partner Troy in his trademark elliptical manner given that his character's motivations remain suspect until revelations come to light toward the end. Due to the nature of the film, other characters are not as fully realized, including Jamie Foxx doing commendable work in a relatively small role as the unyielding Staff Sgt. Sykes (his one personal scene when he discusses his life at home seems shoehorned in), Dennis Haysbert in a couple of scenes as the arrogant Major Lincoln, Chris Cooper effectively Schwartzkopf-like as Lt Colonel Kazinski, and the young actors portraying Swofford's fellow recruits. It took me a while to recognize Lucas Black, who plays the horny redneck Kruger, as the young boy in Billy Bob Thornton's "Sling Blade".<br /><br />Performances aside, the standout work is Roger Deakins' cinematography, which captures the surreal atmosphere of the deserts with the mirage-inducing heat during the day and the burning oil wells at night. There are few scenes more painfully evocative of the war than the one where the Marines come upon the charred remains of locals frozen as if caught in an A-bomb attack. The overall realism of the movie is what makes this noteworthy, and to the filmmakers' credit, it has no political agenda beyond showing the agonies of serving in prospect of a war. The soundtrack has period-appropriate music that runs the gamut from Nirvana to Naughty by Nature to C+C Music Factory. The obvious comparison the film engenders is with David O. Russell's 1999 "Three Kings", which shares the same setting and a similar orientation toward black comedy, though I have to say that Russell's film is more inventive. Still, Mendes is an individualistic director whose work is always worth experiencing.<br /><br />The DVD has several solid extras, including two separate commentary tracks. Interestingly, the one with Swofford and Broyles, both familiar with military service firsthand, is more informative than the one provided by Mendes, who focuses more on the themes and his inspirations. There are a handful of deleted scenes which were understandably excised, including one with Sam Rockwell playing Swofford's gung-ho military uncle talking to the camera (actually to Swofford in a flashback), a seeming rip-off of a Christopher Walken's scene in "Pulp Fiction". There is another set of scenes under the umbrella of Swofford's fantasies, also deleted, but intriguing for the black comedy aspect that they seemed to serve. Also included is a longer version of the interview sequence where the media volleys questions to the recruits in documentary style. Veteran film editor Walter Murch adds his commentary to Mendes' on all the deleted scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JPFWKS83R49V.html">A3JPFWKS83R49V</a><br/><p>Jarhead is a movie based on the book of the same name, written by Anthony Swofford. Swofford was a sniper in the Gulf War conflict and he wrote his book as a collection of memoirs, describing the day to day occurrences while fighting in this short war.<br /><br />This movie is based on Swofford's true story and it lets the viewer see what it was like to be a marine in the Gulf War, from the perspective of one man and his recounting of the events. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Swofford in the movie and he offers his thoughts by narrating the movie at different points, allowing the viewer to better understand the thoughts that pass through a man's head when death and destruction are just around the corner.<br /><br />One thing about Jarhead that makes it different from other war movies is the lack of much combat action. There are only a few shooting and fighting scenes and they are not very graphic at all. This could be a letdown for those who watch this movie hoping to see violence, blood, and gore. There isn't much of this, and the movie often drags along at a slower than usual pace for this type of movie.<br /><br />If this movie isn't about combat, then what exactly is it about? Well, it is basically a film about the utter boredom of war- the majority of the hours of each day when there is nothing going on and nothing to do. The viewer gets to observe the men as they look for ways to fill the time in each day. They talk about sex. They talk about politics. They talk about sex. They talk about their girlfriends or wives back home. And they talk about sex some more. Stuck in a combat zone with other men, the guys have to find some way to fill the hours of the day and this movie concentrates its efforts on this aspect of war: What goes on when there is no armed conflict taking place and the soldiers have to find ways to occupy their time.<br /><br />Parts of this movie move very slowly but these slow moments are sometimes interrupted with military action when the enemy draws near. These action scenes, however, don't come even close to the brutal, high- powered action scenes of other war movies. Director Sam Mendes wanted to keep the emphasis of Jarhead on the boredom, since this is what filled the bulk of the day for the men fighting in the Gulf War.<br /><br />Performances in this movie are generally very good, with Jake Gyllenhaal, Jamie Foxx, and Peter Saarsgard leading the way. There is lots of abrasive language in this movie, and much of it is supplied by Jamie Foxx as he attempts to train and lead his troops. The rough language is the main reason this movie earned its "R" rating since the violent scenes are few.<br /><br />Jarhead has a large cast of characters, but you don't really get to know them on a personal level. The only person you really get to know is Anthony Swofford himself. You get to experience his feelings and thoughts through his own narration and through his own actions. But you don't get to know much at all about the other characters and this fact is one of Jarhead's strengths and weaknesses. It is a strength because it keeps the focus of the film on its core premise (the boredom of war and how soldiers deal with it) rather than on the personal lives of the characters themselves. But at the same time, this could be perceived by some viewers as a weakness because many of the characters seem very empty and underdeveloped. I didn't like this aspect of the film at first, but I accepted it more as the film dragged on.<br /><br />Because of the slowness of this movie and its scattered theme, it seems at times like a movie lacking direction. When I viewed it for the first time, I kept waiting for something to happen and I couldn't understand why Mendes didn't insert more action into some of the scenes. Like with the unknown characters, this is how Mendes intended Jarhead to be. No one person comes across as a hero; no vivid scenes of combat are shown; and no important political messages are shared. This is war at its dullest, but according to Swofford's book and the accounts of others who served in the Gulf War, this is pretty much the way it was.<br /><br />More than a movie about combat, Jarhead is a war movie about a man and his day to day experiences. This isn't a great war movie and I can think of many other war films that rank higher on my all time list. But it does offer an interesting perspective, showing how the endless hours with nothing to do can drive a soldier just as crazy as the time spent fighting the enemy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Jarhead is not your typical war movie.  It isn't about some soldier ascending to the plateau of hero or some impossible mission miraculously being achieved or even a slanted commentary on the dehumanization of the soldier experience.  Instinctively, the viewer of a war movie looks for something big in the end - be it a major battle or some philosophical point about war in general.  Jarhead doesn't deliver either of these two things - and that it both its greatest strength and its greatest weakness.<br /><br />Jarhead is a personal war story, a truth-based depiction of military life and the Iraqi War as one Marine lived it.  We meet Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) in boot camp, as he first begins to question his decision to join up.  Swoff is anything but a model soldier, yet somehow he manages to get recruited into an elite Marine Sniper unit commanded by Staff Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Foxx).  His training is ruthless and difficult, yet his sharp-shooting ability gets him through it, despite a few major incidents along the way.  With Saddam's invasion of Kuwait, Swoff and his fellow Marines start to get ready for the real battlefield experience some of them seem to crave.  Rather than hitting the beaches running, though, the men are forced to endure month after month in the middle of very hot, very sandy nowhere.  Running around the desert in full chemical weapons suits is brutal, but nothing is more agonizing to these Marines than the interminable wait for something to happen.  Military discipline or no, it's no great shock when Swoff goes a little stir crazy out there - what is shocking, however, is that he wasn't drummed out of the Corps for what he did.  Anyway, the war finally begins, but it's nothing like what Swoff and his fellow snipers expected.  The war moves too quickly for them, leaving the men walking through wastelands littered with death and destruction and enduring the torture of a constant oily rain from all the oil wells Saddam had torched, as all the while they desperately yearn for the chance to actually engage the enemy and do what they were trained to do.<br /><br />We really only get to know three of the soldiers - Swoff, who just wants out; Troy (Peter Sarsgaard), who just wants to remain a soldier, and Sykes, a career soldier who believes in and loves serving his country - but we get a number of viewpoints into Marine life from other prominent soldiers.  I daresay the emotional climax of the film is unique among the genre of war films; it's the exact opposite of what I expected and is actually quite jarring to sit there and watch.  Its significance is reinforced by the film's ending, but I don't think the conclusion really works all that well.  It's just sort of thrown out there at the end, and I don't think the movie gives us enough to truly put what happens in any real context.  It's the kind of ending, though, that makes you ask yourself what the real point of this movie was.  I've come to the conclusion that there really isn't a definitive point propelling itself through the script.  Managing to tow a rather objective line from start to finish, Jarhead gives you plenty to think about - but it leaves you to take what you will from the viewing experience.<br /><br />There are rarely any simple truths to be found in war, and there's more to being a hero than killing more than your share of enemies.  Don't go into Jarhead expecting an hour's worth of fierce combat or looking to have your pro- or anti-war beliefs strengthened or challenged.  Some people will not like this movie, but I think it's an important film that succeeds pretty darned well in putting the viewer inside the mind of a real soldier.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Were intentions graded instead of product, then JARHEAD would be given 4 stars rather than 3, merely because it is one of the few films (so far) that shows the particular idiosyncrasies of that first Bush war, the DESERT SHIELD transforming into DESERT STORM.  We have many films that document the mindset of the soldiers from the Civil War through the two World Wars, to Korean War to Vietnam War and each is different.  JARHEAD is as much about the changes that have occurred in the American military with the advent of computerized warfare and sophisticated war machines and weapons as it is about the Greed for Oil Dominance that prompted the US Kuwaiti involvement.  And for that this film is important and will remain so until something better comes along.<br /><br />The story is rather minimal and as narrated by the author of the novel on which it is based, Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal), it takes a while to become airborne.  Swoff is a disillusioned kid who can't figure out how to make life meaningful so he opts for the USMC as a staging zone in his growth. What he discovers is the usual boot camp mentality and training, encountering other men who have both similar and different reasons for joining the Corps: Troy (Peter Saarsgard) has dark issues that remain with him throughout the story; Kruger (Lucas Black) opted for the Corps instead of prison; Cortez (Jacob Vargas) needed money to support his pregnant wife; Cuban immigrant Escobar (Laz Alonso) sincerely is a grateful patriot, etc. Along the way the boys encounter the stereotype DI (Scott MacDonald), the Staff Sergeant (Jamie Fox) and the company commander Lt Col Kazinski (Chris Cooper) as well as the usual variety of testosterone provoked young kids successfully brainwashed to be 'fighting men'.<br /><br />The bulk of the story after boot camp is the boredom of going to war in the Kuwaiti desert, having nothing at all to do except play dumb games and wait and hydrate, until at last the Staff Sergeant gleefully announces Saddam Hussein is shooting and they are off to actually do what they were trained to do - Fight!  But even that is thwarted as they wade through a miserable existence of seeing sky-darkened oil well fires, constant oil raining from the burning oil money holes, losing buddies to friendly fire and mistaken attacks by their own air support.  And just at the point when this company of trained snipers (especially Swoff and Troy) gets the chance to kill, the 'war' is over and they go home.  And in Swofford's narrative comments he notes how those men will never be allowed to leave the desert experience behind. 'Wars are different, yet wars are the same'.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal, buffed and shaved headed, gives us everything Swoff represents - as far as the meager script and misguided direction by Sam Mendes allow.  He is a fine actor and his range of emotions is what holds the film together.  The remainder of the cast likewise does their best to make their shadowy character outlines from the screenplay by William Broyles Jr. as close to three-dimensional as the lines allow.  Yes, the film is about a new kind of soldier, one less driven by patriotism and more informed about the commercial greed that drives these fiascos, and Mendes does allow us to see that.  But deeper character development and motivation could have made this a more powerful antiwar statement than a visual excursion of life under the sun of the foreign desert skies.

Not really about war or it's aftermath, but the waiting for a war to begin.<br />Anticpation can work on you. These Marines  are primed for action. It's oppressively hot, they are on edge, with nothing to do but [...] They are out on the endless vistas of the desert where the enemy can pick them off at any time. Jake Gyllenhaal does a creditable job as Swofford the author of the book, narrator & main character of the movie. Actually "Swoff" felt he had little choice. His father was a Marine whose life was screwed up by Vietnam, & his grandfather before that was also a Marine. So Swoff joined without a whole lot of conviction. They turned him into a sniper. Jamie Foxx is Sykes, Swoff's Sgt. & mentor. His mission in life is to keep his men alive. If he is not loved by his men he is respected & you'd want him to have your back. Basically, Jamie Foxx dominates every scene he is in. They all want action & desire to kill the enemy, including Swoff. Eventually war does come & Swoof is to get a chance to use the specialty he been trained for. At the last second, it is snatched away & hours later the war was over. I understood his frustration. Yet knowing he did not kill a man for any good reason might stay with him longer than his frustration. He never fires his weapon in war, his war, which he says lasted about four days, after half a year of inactivity in the desert. The horror of all those oil wells burning was brought to the screen in some great special effects. Scenes of boot camp are always fun, spotting the inaccuracies. More fun if you've been there.

Gyllenhaal stars as Anthony Swofford, a twenty year old raw recruit who joined the Marines because, in his words, he got lost on the way to college.  Upon arriving in boot camp, Swoff witnesses some other Marines with a homemade USMC brand.  Soon, Swoff is corralled by the other Marines, thrown to the ground, and the brand is brought to his leg.  However, Swoff ends up passing out.  Upon waking, he realizes that he wasn't branded.  Troy (Peter Sasarsgaard) informs Swoff that he must earn the brand.  The two soon become friends.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx stars as Staff Sergeant Sykes, a career soldier who is in command of an eight-man sniper team.  There are four spotters and four shooters.  Swoff is chosen as a shooter, while Troy becomes Swoff's spotter.  The group trains endlessly until all the members of the team are experts at their craft.  During their training, the Iraqis invade Kuwait, and Swoff's unit is sent to the Gulf as part of Operation Desert Shield.<br /><br />Upon arriving in the Gulf, the men find themselves with a little too much time on their hands.  Time is spent by writing letters or playing football.  In one instance, their football gets them into trouble, as Sgt. Sykes forces the men to put on their chemical warfare suits and play an entire game of football while members of the press look on.<br /><br />After being in the Gulf region for several months with no action besides their own training, the war finally began in January, 1991.  When the land campaign began, Swoff's unit was thrust into the fighting.  Swoff and Troy were chosen to take out two Iraqi soldiers who were in a control tower.  Making their way cautiously over the hot desert sand, they arrive at the perfect shooting site, 900 yards from their target.  Having been given clearance to shoot, Swoff prepares to pull the trigger on his sniper rifle.  However, just before he can shoot, another officer bursts through the door and informs Swoff and Troy that an airstrike is going to take out the tower.  Despite all of their training and time spent in the Gulf, Swoff never got to fire his rifle in anger.<br /><br />After the war, the group returned to the United States to many well-wishers who welcomed them home.  One poignant moment at the end of the movie shows a Vietnam vet jump into Swoff's company's bus and shake hands with the men while telling them that they did a great job.  One can sense that the Vietnam vet wished he would have received the same type of welcome twenty years earlier.  Swoff's war lasted 4 days and 4 hours.<br /><br />This is a very powerful movie.  It compares closely to Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket".  Both movies were told through the eyes of a single soldier.  The accuracy of life in the desert is apparent throughout the movie, especially the parts where the soldiers are forced to deal with their boredom.  The battle scenes are authentic as well, including the massive wreckage caused by the A-10 "Warthog" tank busters against Iraqi vehicles.<br /><br />I recommend this movie.  The acting, especially by Jamie Foxx and Jake Gyllenhaal, is very good, the combat sequences are realistic, and the story is compelling.  Watch this very good movie and experience life in the Marines during Operation Desert Storm through the eyes of a Marine sniper.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>I wanted to like "Jarhead."  I am a former Army officer myself (by way of disclosure) but I have always had a soft spot for Marines.  This film has several problems that essentially will ruin it for almost any viewer.  There is virtually no plot, there is virtually no war, and the depiction in the film of the Marines does not cut the mustard in terms of accuracy or plausibility.<br /><br />With respect to plausibility--to take just one example, in the film a recruit dies in a live-fire exercise.  The drill sergeant curses up a storm, and things move on, apparently with no consequences.  What rubbish.  Anyone who has ever served knows that such events, rare but not unheard-of, involve huge consequences and the military (yes, including those tough Marines) take such events very seriously.  Generally losing a soldier or Marine under such circumstances is a career-ending move for the man in charge.  This flick implies that the Sarge went out for a beer afterwords and forgot about it.  Not likely.<br /><br />Another outrageous matter in this mediocre film was the notion that one Marine could (or would) pull a firearm on a fellow Marine.  Complete nonsense.  This would constitute, at a minimum, an assault under the UCMJ and would never be tolerated, not anywhere or anywhen.  A court-martial would be the inevitable outcome, probably ending with a bad-conduct discharge.<br /><br />The overall depiction of Marines was more or less a Hollywood stereotype.  Yes, combat troopers, whether Marines or Army, are loud, irreverent, and yes profane, but not to the idiotic extremes depicted in this film.  After awhile the endless (and they are endless in the movie) antics, yelling, and horseplay by the Marines starts to grate.<br /><br />I could have (barely) tolerated and forgiven the Hollywood stereotype of Marines if this film had had a decent plot.  Sorry, there pretty much is no plot.  I can handle the notion that the First Gulf War was 99% hurry-up-and-wait.  That is the gist of modern warfare, and probably most warfare going back to ancient Sparta.  But this is, after all, a movie with a presumed purpose of entertaining the viewer.  So we needed a plot a little bit deeper than the various Marines' girl friends being unfaithful to them.  But we don't get one in this film.<br /><br />There are some funny moments in this flick that redeem it from being a one-star, but this is not a film that most viewers would ever want to watch more than once.  RJB.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />An excellent and original take on modern warfare that presents many indelible images (the burning oilfields, road of death, etc.) and two very good supporting performances by Jamie Foxx and Peter Sarsgaard, Jarhead is a much different movie than most people expected, but it's also a very worthy and thought-provoking one.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>What can you say about a movie that has so many fine ingredients?  This is all the hallmarks of a great movie - great director, terrific acting, epic cinematography, relevant message. And yet without a real narrative to hang on, this is a movie about the atmosphere - in particular, the cumulative effect of atmosphere.  It will depend on the viewer if that atmosphere is enough to sustain interest.<br />Jake Gyllenhaal is terrifically convincing as the na?ve young `average young man' who joins up instead of going to college.  His journey is the lynchpin of the movie, and he makes it work.  He starts off in the usual drill sergeant shouting at recruits type scenes, and finally gets to the Gulf.  There, the movie is about the waiting.  The boredom and frustration of being built up to act, and then sit on their heels unable to act..  Problem is, in convincingly conveying the boredom and frustration of the men, the viewer is equally bored and frustrated.  The war starts, and yet the frustration is never truly released for the group of marines, and in the final scenes the end is somewhat bleak to say the least.  The cream of the most macho soldiers are made to look impotent.<br />This is a timely look at what some of the pressures must have been like - there are probably also parallels to be made with today's conflict, even though the situation is quite different.  As the lead says towards the end - Every war is different - and every war is the same.<br />So is this enough to spend your two hours on the couch..? The answer is probably only just - there was more that could have been made of these memoirs. But accepting its flaws, its probably still interesting enough to get through - just not if you are an action junkie!</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>This war film contains precious little action. It's anti-war in the sense that the main character never gets to fire a shot (as Gulf War I is over so quickly) and so is left frustrated - and the viewer is left with this feeling too. We certainly get to experience the boredom and tension that came with the six months preparation for the war. Well made and well acted but not that entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>I knew from the start that "Jarhead" had the potential to be a polarizing film. Any time you address a contemporary and controversial political topic--you end up with reviews at both ends of that political spectrum. In other words, it's generally a love it or hate it proposition. It's either genius or its crap. After the film received decidedly mixed reviews upon its release, it's not something I rushed out to see. However, to my amazement, the film is surprisingly apolitical. It's a simple tale with a few observations about the nature of modern warfare, but no real message.<br /><br />I see most of the negative reviews posted here disparage the film because it's not a war film. True enough, but that doesn't complete negate the movie either. I do think that the film works as a character study, a slice of life. It was interesting to me how the expectations of what the experience would be like were thwarted with what this team actually encountered. The boredom, insecurity and need to feel a part of something important are a valid statement. After all, this was basically one guy's experience. And "Jarhead" is successful enough at showcasing that one element.<br /><br />Now, I will admit the talent associated with the film led me to believe that this would be an "important" film. It doesn't have the flair and audacity of "Three Kings," for example. It's a more mundane story that shows a different aspect of battle, or lack thereof. It may not be what you're expecting--but that doesn't always make it bad. And it's definitely a well made picture with some amusing moments and some good performances.<br /><br />"Jarhead" is a compelling study of a disaffected youth in a profession he questions. The story is not uncommon. In this case, though, the backdrop just happens to be Iraq. KGHarris, 10/06.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M597GCCE1N2S.html">A2M597GCCE1N2S</a><br/><p>Jarhead is one movie that many people seem to think you either really hate it or really like it. I personally liked the acting and how Jamie Foxx once again shined in a movie plus Jake Gyllenhaal showed he can act in almost any role convincingly. [Although I don't think I should remind any of you about Bubble Boy] This is one story about a man who joined the army, suffers some intensive training, and whose war lasts a mere four days and doesn't even have a chance to fire his rifle.<br /><br />Anthony Swoff [Gyllenhaal] is a young man who joins the Marines back in the first Gulf War. He leaves behind a young girlfriend to become a sniper, one of the best the Marines have to offer. He is joined by Staff Seargant Sykes [Jamie Foxx] who is a no nonsense, "Marine for life" man who wants no bullsh*t from anyone and is as tough as he is passionate about being a Marine.<br /><br /> After surviving live fire obstacle courses, scouting and learning how to judge distances with nothing more than the knowledge of the lengths of football fields, and even having to play musical instruments looking like a fool in front of his fellow marines with nothing more than his vocal cords, Swoff survives and becomes a sniper. A few weeks later the war starts and Swoff is sent off to prepare for an attack in Iraq.<br /><br />What was one unique aspect of the movie was seeing how different numbers of troops in the war steadily grew as another day passed. In the beginning it said, "Time in desert - 14 minutes. Troops in desert - 5,000." Then 3 months later it would say, "Time in desert - 93 days. Troops in desert - 100,000." Meanwhile Swoff and his friends are left to camp in their base with nothing more to do than talk about anything and everthing to keep from being bored.<br /><br />Whether it's talking about every girlfriend they ever had, to talking about different religions they believe in, and even holding a fighting ring for wild scorpions they caught, the marines desperately wait for the chance to get the word to head into fighing.<br /><br />This movie shows mostly the horrors about war including after finally getting the word to go into Iraq, Swoff and his men find a bombed out area of cars and bodies of people while patrolling along the deserts. There is even a tense moment after an altercation with several men on camels who can't be indentified as hostiles or not.<br /><br />This is one movie that you should definately check out if you want to see great acting as each character shines in their own way. Plus there is a great bonfire party scene after the men get the word that they are going home and everyone fires their guns into the air.<br /><br />Extras of the DVD:<br /><br />Deleted scenes<br /><br />Showing the interviews shown in the movie in their entirety<br /><br />plus subtitles and more!<br /><br />Definately rent this to check out. I'm not going to highly recommend this movie because I don't want you wasting your money and thinking you should have bought "Black Hawk Down" or something. I rented this movie and decided it was worth keeping. But I do recommend renting this to see at least once.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Jarhead (Sam Mendes, 2005)<br /><br />First off: for those of you who haven't yet seen it, despite what the trailers imply, Jarhead is not your typical soldiers-in-wartime movie. It's not a soldiers-in-peacetime movie; either; it's about that period of "hurry up and wait" the we called Operation Desert Shield.<br /><br />Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a marine. No one, least of all him, knows why. ("I got lost on the way to college, sir!") He survives boot camp and, after some training, ships off to the desert for Desert Shield, where there was little to do but play tricks on reporters, watch war movies, and slowly go insane. Swofford and his seven teammates do a lot of all three.<br /><br />Despite the fact that this movie is, basically, about nothing, it's very well done. Mendes brings in some of the out-of-touch-with-reality vibe that made American Beauty such a fun movie and combines it with a very, very wrong humor. It's all the insanity of Apocalypse Now-- a film to which it wears its debt naked on its sleeve-- without all the things blowing up. Gyllenhaal is supported by a fine cast of others, including Jamie Foxx (who's really come into his own as a dramatic player), Peter Sarsgaard, and Evan Jones, who looks more like Flea with each passing day.<br /><br />Fun, even-- especially, perhaps-- if you're not a fan of war movies. *** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A29Y34ALWJUGB5.html">A29Y34ALWJUGB5</a><br/><p>I think that, without Jamie Fox or Jake Gyllenhaal, this movie would have sucked. Something about these two actors just seemed to click in the movie and the plotting. They acted their roles with brilliance and were as convincing as if they had actually lived the lives of the marines in this story.<br /><br />The story itself follows one marine through his training all the way up to the last hours of Desert Storm. During this time, we see a soldier's life during Desert Shield, before the war with Irag began, and just how difficult life was, and how boring as well. It is so boring, in fact, that the soldiers want nothing more than to put at least one kill underneath their belts. Yet Jake Gyllenhaal and his comrades are sniper scouts, marines who see little action as it is, and getting those kills is going to be difficult. What follows is actually a slow decent into insanity for some of the soldiers, or constant paranoia about life at home, and what they may be missing. When all put together, it's actually more of a character study than anything else, since Jake Gyllenhaal's character goes through all of these emotions.<br /><br />What I liked most about this movie was the simple fact that it's a true story, as well as it's based during the Gulf War. We get to see little of this relatively pointless war, and when a movie is made about it, I'm generally excited to see it. And thanks to some well-acted characters as well as the true-story backing, it adds some concrete to what had looked to be an unstable mix. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed Three Kings (the only other Gulf War movie I know of). It's a funny and occasionally emotional journey into the lives of some very bored marines.</p></br><a href="../users/A37S3ACL57LN62.html">A37S3ACL57LN62</a><br/><p>Jarhead is not a typical war film. It focuses on how life changes when you go to war, not on the war itself. Instead of constantly seeing battle scenes and death, we see what is a little more important, the humanity of the soldiers and their transformation as people. We see training, goofing off, suspicions of unfaithful girlfriends at home, mental anguish, and soldiers in a war who do not know why they are fighting.<br /><br />The film is incredibly fluid and incredibly powerful all until the very last scene. All of the dialogue seems natural even if the words are clich&eacute;. They ring true. However, the very last scene seems forced as if the writer wanted to wrap up the film neatly. It was not done well.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal is great as the main character Swoffard. He brings raw emotionalism to the screen. He plays the character in a way that everyone can understand and relate to. His performance is key to the film because it makes the story seem personal.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx is surprisingly good in his role as the Staff Sergeant. He is real, raw, and relatable. He shows both the aggression and strength of a military official and the frankness and dynamic personality of a regular citizen.<br /><br />Although the film takes place in the desert, the scenery is gorgeous. Chopping this film up to fit a television screen will hinder it enormously. The widescreen is employed beautifully. One of the most poignant scenes in the film is where the oil wells are burnt. The sky is black, there is oil falling from the sky like rain, and and the soldiers look around at hell. The scenery is so vivid and striking; it is unsettling in an extremely effective way.<br /><br />The music in this film is also utilized to great effect. Songs are never distracting to the film; they always fit the scenes to illustrate them but never to overpower them.<br /><br />This film leaves the audience with an overall feeling of sadness. These men lost their former lives in a war that lasted only a few days. The audience is brought into that struggle and that loss, leaving with a feeling similar to that of those involved. This is a thought provoking film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I read more reviews that didn't like this film than those who did. I usually don't care what critics say (I loved SAW II) and they were wrong here as well. The acting is what makes this film. The three leads (Jake G, Peter S, and Jamie Foxx) are all outstanding here. The first half of Jarhead contains a lot of humor, while the second half is very serious in tone. It's like two different films, but they both mesh together nicely. This is not an action film by any means. I was fooled to believe so by the previews, so thanks to those pesky critics I read, I went into the theater expecting a drama with very little action. And because I knew what to expect, I got exactly what I wanted. Jarhead probably will never break into the list of best war films ever made, but it is one that should be respected for showing a different side of war, one where the main character never fires a single shot in combat.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CW9IQAPFEYLM.html">A2CW9IQAPFEYLM</a><br/><p>Most war movies are obviously categorized as "action" movies, but this is slightly different. The men have gone through their Marine bootcamp training, where they've gained the confidence and pride necessary to do their jobs, thanks to their somewhat sterotypical monsterish drill sergeant (think of Louis Gossett in AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN). Jake Gyllenhaal plays the real life Anthony Swofford, who is further tormented and molded into an elite sniper by Jamie Foxx as Sergeant Sykes (Foxx is excellent). Swofford adds to the differences found in this movie - he is set off from the others by his detached personality (he reads Camus, for one thing). When the first Irag War breaks out they are ready and gung-ho for action.<br /><br />But here where the war movie action would typically begin, inaction comes to dominate. The men don't fight, but wait to fight (as the days tick by, their numbers are flashed on the screen). Talk comes to replace action - Foxx spiels about his great love for the Marines, the men fantasize about well, what men fantasize about, old movie images of war (such as APOCALYPSE NOW) take over for the real thing. Sometimes crazy things take place - a football game played wearing gas masks, for example.<br /><br />Sometimes the men are shown under great stress, weeping and cracking up, though it's hard to see exactly why, as if director Mendes was just trying to show us these guys have emotions after all. Mendes is also not above making cheap shots: "We never have to come back [here] again," says one Marine at war's end - sharp elbow in ribs just in case we didn't get the irony.<br /><br />But the acting is excellent, and the camaraderie among the men rings true. And the bleak desert landscape is rendered starkly and well by Roger Deakins. The fact that things are over before you know it and it's the training and the waiting that weighs the heaviest comes across pointedly in this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G6GO4O7EVCPF.html">A2G6GO4O7EVCPF</a><br/><p>Jaky Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain, Highway) stars as Anthony Swoffard who is in the deserts of Saudi Arabia where he is being trained by Sgt. Sykes played by Jamie Foxx (Ray, Collateral), to get ready for the on coming war. Swofford becomes a sniper and his spotter is Troy, played by Peter Sarsgaard (Skeleton Key, Shattered Glass). Darkly funny and some scenes with power make JarHead interesting and the direction is amazing, be it explosions or soldiers walking along burnt cars or oil fields at night on fire with is scary and beautiful at the same time. Also starring Chris Cooper (Capote, October Sky), Jacob Vargas (Nexy Friday, Traffic), Lucas Black (Crazy In Alabama, Sling Blade) and Dennis Haysbert (Tv's 24, Absolute Power) They got refrences from The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now and Giant with James Dean. Gyllenhaal gives one of his best performances so far, Sarsgaard is explosive and Jamie Foxx digs out of the BOMB pit that was the movie Stealth. "Welcome to the Suck!"</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: What if there was a movie that wasn't about war, but about the soldiers. Jarhead is exactly that, a film about the jarheads who went to war just to grab a gun and kill some Iraqis. That's pretty much what Jarhead is about. No battle, no gore, just guys finding themselves out in the desert. Unfortunetly the film lacks depth, it lacks substance. The audience doesn't grow with the characters, and there is nothing for the audience to work with. There is a scene in the beginning were Jake Gyllenhaal's character starts to narrate some events from his life. Then the camera moves out of the room and the door closes, and his character states that we the audience aren't allowed to see his past. Unfortunetly, by denying the audience the character's background, the characters appear static and then there is nothing to emotionally connect with. The only thing the film boasts is some amazing cinematography and decent acting, but they totally go to waste because of the the weak story. Almost everyone I know wanted to see Jarhead, and you can thank Universal for their brilliant (but deceptive) marketing campaign. The trailer was brilliantly put together while accompanied by "Jesus Walks" by Kanye West. What this did was appeal the movie to a wider audience. By having a rap song highlight your trailer you open to teens and the urban audience. The tv spots hit hard and fast with the song as well. I knew before I walked in what this movie was about, because I know Sam Mendes as a director and he doesn't do action. So, everyone had expectations for this gung ho war epic, and instead they got a character piece, and that's why alot of people were disssapointed. I was dissapointed because there was never a connection of the characters to the audience, and when there is an emotional distance from the audience to your characters that is never a good sign.<br /><br />ACTING: There is a lot of yelling in this movie, well, that's pretty much all there is. A bunch of young men sitting around in the desert just waiting to kill someone. Jake Gyllenhaal does a good job, not steller but good.  Jamie Foxx, who was advertised as a main selling point in the trailer, does an acceptable job too. The acting was acceptable, nothing more.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The cinematography is brilliant, then again we come to expect that from a Sam Mendes film. Unfortunetly, while the film may be pretty to look at it's not interesting to watch. The characters are underdeveloped, and the movie doesn't do much with them.</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>i thought this was a good move for Jamie foxx after his roles in 2004,but the film is all over the place. Jake Gyllenhaal does a decent job in this film,but this film feels like a Music video in spots&just takes on so many cliches of service life&War without having a real central zone. the film felt long&just  didn't really move me in the end. there was a great story wanting to come out,but this film was nowhere in that neighborhood to me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>This film had received bad reviews from a political standpoint. I read a couple before I saw this film. They mostly didn't like it because.......what they say again............ O yeah,because it had no message or stance. To that I say good. It was refreshing to see a movie as a movie. I was glad that it was just a story, and there wasn't any motivation underneath it. That's not to say that the movie is one dimensional. There are many undertones, just none of which are attempting to reassert or defame the current war in the East.<br /><br />As someone who is married into the military, I thought this movie was great. If you are looking for a message about war or politics you won't find it here. This movie is strictly a story told by the main character about his time serving in the Marine Corps and his tour in the Gulf. It is true to life. From the language, situations, to the way the characters interact, the film is right on with accuracy.<br /><br />The film's cinematography is nice. Scenes in the desert, especially with the oil fires, are breathtaking. The shots are done perfectly and originally throughout while the score and soundtrack takes it to a powerful emotional level. the lack of warfare becomes a theme for this film.<br /><br />Peter Sarsgaard, in a great performance, reaches his breaking point during the final third of the film, and it's a riveting moment where the lack of warfare has finally made him explode. His performance is very strong throughout, but it is not until the second half of the film when he finally gets the chance to break loose. Don't mistake the first half of his performance as simply being on-screen... charisma that palpable doesn't happen by accident. It is because he uses his scenes and lines wisely in the first half that we end up so engrossed and fascinated by him in the second. A true supporting performance. Jamie Foxx surprised me here, and not because I didn't think he was a fine actor. Obviously, he is. But his character is so well-conceived, and works wonderfully as the counterpoint to the Gyllenhaal character. Jake maintain an incredible performance. Watch for a dozen scenes where he literally explodes off the screen, but how he also juggles the quieter moments with great aplomb. What makes Swofford an intriguing character is that he doesn't always get our sympathy; or, for that matter, want our sympathy.<br /><br />In summation, JARHEAD is a viscerally unforgiving, psychologically heartbreaking masterpiece. See this film if you want to see a humorous, sad, psychotic, intense, and most importantly REAL story.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I really wanted to like this one a whole lot more than I did.  A fine cast of actors do a wonderful job.  So no complaints about any of the actors.  I think the story did a good job of capturing the mind set of a soldier, and the tedium that can come with being a soldier even during a war.  I wish they had spent more time covering the boot camp portion of Gyllenhaal's character.  I am a huge fan of Full Metal Jacket's boot camp beginning.  Once they get to the Gulf to fight, it is a tiny bit of a letdown.  The mother of all battles really doesn't take place as the alliance steamrolls right through the Iraqi forces.  Well made picture, but just not everything I would hope it would be.  Very nice dvd package though with tons of extras.</p></br></body></html>

"The butterfly effect" is a dark, difficult and very shocking movie, full of sadness and suffering. DO NOT BELIEVE the regular press reviews! Watch it and make up your mind. You can love it (like me) or hate it, but believe me you will not be bored - and you will NOT forget it easily.<br /><br />I find it rather hard to believe that somebody dared to make not one but two sequels of this film! "Butterfly effect" is THE movie with conclusion. It goes full circle and ends the story without any ambiguity. This is probably one of the reasons that both sequels were so bad.<br /><br />This movie is mostly a one boy/one girl show. Ashton Kutcher may not be the greatest of actors, but in this film he is very good! And I really would like to see Amy Smart in more movies - why isn't she playing more? She is so beautiful and talented! Other actors are quite unknown, but still they perform well in supporting the two main protagonists.<br /><br />I will not reveal anything about the plot, except that at the end you will be surprised, shocked and HURT - and you will find the exact and clear answer to the question which is the title of this review...</p></br><a href="../users/A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4.html">A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4</a><br/><p>Evan  (Ashton Kutcher) is a young man who's blocked out specific events from his memory...events that not only traumatized  Evan , but also traumatized two of his friends as well as the brother of one of those friends.  Determined to get those memories back,  Evan  figures out a way to travel back in time to revisit those memories.  However, what he uncovers is so disturbing that he now wants to change those events so the future can  turn out better for  both him and his friends.<br /><br />But  no matter how hard he tries, changing the past doesn't create the happy ending  Evan  is hoping for, which frustrates him.  When he tries to save one person, another person ends up getting mentally and/or physically crippled ... and some even get killed.  Soon,  Evan  becomes obsessed with trying to get the past right and starts losing his mind in the process.<br />It's only when he stops trying to control everything that he eventually sets everyone free....but it's also tragic in what he has to do to make that happen.<br /><br />I'm used to seeing  Ashton Kutcher  play dopey roles in "That 70's Show" and "Dude, Where's my Car?", so I didn't know if  Kutcher  could pull off a serious role.  He did surprisingly well.  The supporting characters are also convincing in their roles, too.  Evan's childhood male friend  is especially chilling in the bedroom scene where we see how  Evan's  actions changed his future.<br /><br />Just a word of warning, when it's revealed what really happened in  Evan's  childhood, it's pretty disturbing what's revealed.  You don't actually see what happens in graphic detail (thank goodness), but it is implied so your imagination fills in the blanks.<br />Overall, I thought this was a compelling story.  The beginning starts out mysteriously as you see a little boy go into these fugue states and you don't know why, but are curious to know why.  It's also compelling to see if  Evan  can ever right what went wrong in his past.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>Ashton Kutcher proved that he could carry an entire film on his own with "The Butterfly Effect". Up until the release of this movie Ashton was simply typecast as a TV personality, but after the release of "Butterfly" he became a leading man and a huge Hollywood star.<br /> Ashton plays a young man who had a very troubled childhood. He discovers that now, in the present, he has the power to actually go back in time and alter and change his past, sometimes with results not of his own doing.<br /> This is a compelling story and unlike anything Hollywood has ever done. The script and performances are flawless. Amy Smart, who plays Ashton's girlfriend, is excellent, and plays a woman who was sexually abused by her father, and who grows up to be a drug-addicted prostitute.<br /> This particular DVD has two versions: the director's cut and the theatrical one. There are a slew of bonuses including the filmaker's commentary, documentaries on the movie called "The Creative Process" and "Visual Effects", a storyboard gallery, and theatrical trailer. Paul Fischer of "Dark Horizons" says, ""The Butterfly Effect" is an engrossing, unpredictable and original film, more chilling and compelling the "The Sixth Sense"".<br /> This DVD is a dual-layered disc with one side featuring the director's cut and the other the theatrical version. There is also a small booklet that accompanies the set that features the movie chapters.<br /> There are two sequels to "The Butterfly Effect", but neither comes near to the originality and perfection of this one. Save your money and buy "The Butterfly Effect". It is unlike any movie you have seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>What if you could change your past:<br />remove that very bad thing that happened to you<br />or your friends when you were young and foolish?<br />The journals that he started when the blackouts began<br />serve as 'memory' devices that allow his mind to travel in time.<br />Each time he changes thing they get progressively worse:<br />somebody dies or goes crazy or ends up without arms.<br />He finally solves the riddle of their lives, but loses<br />his true love in the process!</p></br><a href="../users/AB1UMC7SB9D7Z.html">AB1UMC7SB9D7Z</a><br/><p>After being recommended this movie on three different Internet recommendation engines, being told to see it by a good friend, and having half a dozen other people mention it, I figured I had to get around to seeing it.  This is generally not a good way to go about seeing a movie because either one's hopes are too high or one wants to dislike it just so that everyone can stop talking about it.<br /><br />But I liked it.  It's a pretty tight psychological thriller, involving a pretty typical storyline about alterations to the past causing the future to to turn out in "unexpected ways"... rarely ever the way the protagonist really wants it to be. "I'll make everything perfect!" he decrees.<br /><br />Ashton Kutcher is an interesting actor.  I think he's a lot like Keira Knightley: both of them CAN act, it's just that if the director doesn't tell them to they won't.  However, this movie shows Kutcher's one-up to Knightley in that he actually did act in this one, and Knightley has yet to fully embrace a role (but I haven't seen all of her movies, so who knows on that part).<br /><br />Anyway, I think the biggest thing that prevented me from giving this movie a higher score is the way the children are presented.  I know that children can be damaged, and can do extreme and horrific things, but oftentimes I have a hard time accepting a movie where they find each other and end up the whole group of them hurting each other.  It's hard to explain, but it's the same reason why I don't really accept a lot of the contemporary cop dramas... there seems a need in those to get some mentally damaged woman with a completely differently mentally damaged man, and then work out this intricate plot involving how their mental problems cause this huge crime but also hide it in layers of mental instability.  Same thing here, I find it pretty difficult to accept four kids from three different families all with their completely separate lives coming together to create specific incident which one just happens to be able to twist around.  More than making the story unbelievable, it's a matter of making it seem as if everybody out there is some insane psychopath ready to explode in the right situation...  when actually psychopaths are generally kind of rare.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I like Ashton Kutcher as a comedic character, but I really didn't have much faith in him to carry off this roll.  I was pleasantly surprised he did so well.  Ashton's character is followed from boyhood to young adult.  He has always suffered from blackouts in which he can't remember some of the terrible things that have happened in his life.  He finds a unique power that inables him to go back in time to change a signifigant event.  But the problem with changing just one thing in the past is the ripple effect, and each time he makes a change he comes back to a very differant future for himself.  The movie involves him just trying to make things right for himself and the ones he loves.  Well produced film.  This dvd is loaded with extras.  I would certainly go with the director's cut.  It adds more depth to the film and the ending is terrific.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J66TA573ZPRX.html">A1J66TA573ZPRX</a><br/><p>This is a good movie that is alot like the time machine but different but good. I recently bought the dvd and i thoght it was not going to be good but i bought it anyway and liked it. SO i think all people should see it there are some really violent parts but its all part of the story.  Amy Smart is also hot.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y87E22UVYCE6.html">A1Y87E22UVYCE6</a><br/><p>"The Butterfly Effect" (2004) is a very much underrated gripping sci-fi film. I was expecting to see a moderately entertaining class B film and discovered a hard, solid and intelligent cinematographic work.<br /><br />The story is quite complicate and requires the audience to be paying special attention.<br /><br />It starts showing Evan, a young boy, whose father is interned in a psychiatric institution and his mother is stressed fulfilling maternal and paternal roles.<br /><br />He is prone to suffer blackouts which left him without recollection of what happened pending them.<br /><br />The psychiatrist that had nursed his father is consulted and recommends him to keep a detailed diary as to enhance his memory.<br /><br />Several critical scenes with Evan passing out and covering a period of 15 years are shown.<br /><br />He finally gets into university, applies to study psychology and specializes in memory phenomena.<br /><br />Suddenly when reading his diary he is able to remember what happened that time, but not only that he actually "re-lived" the moment.<br /><br />That's the real kick-off the action. He is able to go back and change some critical fact (trying to suppress evil consequences). Well... those consequences ARE suppressed but a sort of new alternate universe emerges and... new awful events will occur or has already occurred.<br /><br />Evan doggedly goes back time and again, muddling everything up to the last desperate effort.<br /><br />The film is co-directed and co-wrote by Eric Bress & J. Mackey Gruber and they prove to be a good team in both aspects. I hope they'll keep this quality level in future releases.<br /><br />Playacting is compact and convincing. The group of kid & juvenile actors and actress keep a resemblance with the adult characters really astounding (I don't know if it was enhanced by make-up or other techniques).<br /><br />It is a shocking movie. Some scenes are revulsive but not gratuitously as I've seen in many recent films. So be aware of this situation in order to decide who will be able to see it and who don't.<br /><br />This is a highly recommended film for sci-fi aficionados and general public.<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>I just finished watching this film. I've had in my mind for a long time now that I had to watch this film. Had I watched it earlier, I would have realise how seamless this film is in terms of storyline and shock value._Ashton Kutcher_ plays the role of not one but two lifetimes. This movie is probably ONE OF THE THREE most engrossing films I have seen in the latter half of this year. It took me one hour to realise what the film was all about and it took me an hour and five mins to realise I was wrong. This film is likely to question your own ability to access your own sub-conscience and thought analysing extremes. The last half an hour of the film was gripping and also extremely well directed. The pace of the film is shocking and the effects are super. I can go on and on about the film but I would never really be able to fully comprehend in my review what this film is "all" about.Hey reader, Watch this film you think you deserve the need to deserve to watch it.<br /><br />PS - The other two films that shocked me this year were "Oldboy" and "Crash" [Click on me for reviews]</p></br><a href="../users/A3GA09FYFKL4EY.html">A3GA09FYFKL4EY</a><br/><p>Ignore "Dude, Where's My Car" and the campy pranks on Punk'd - Ashton Kutcher is first and foremost an actor, and it shows in this dark drama of a sex abuse survivor who struggles to change history to protect both himself and those he loves. An interesting premise based on the "if you could, should you try"? question of time travel and altering history. Kutcher's angst is excellent in this accurate portrayal of an abuse survivor.  The scenes of child molestation, while suggested and not shown, are deeply disturbing as they should be. Recommend for very mature audiences.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT is a film that has many flaws and challenges the concept of logic, indeed.  However, as a time travel adventure, it offers some complex scenarios, and challenges the theory that if you change one little thing, the results can be overwhelmiing.<br /><br />Ashton Kutcher does a convincing job as the young man who uses his childhood journals to travel back and try to change things for the better----each time making things worse for either himself or his loved ones.  Jesse James as the young badass Tommy is chilling; few child actors have conveyed such a sense of evil menace and complete psychosis.  Amy Smart does a good job in her many incarnations of Kayleigh.  The direction is sharp and imaginative, with the visual leaps in time handled quite well.<br /><br />The movie has a sad ending (at least in the director's cut), but it is fitting I guess since Kutcher was doing more harm than good in his attempts to recreate history.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>The trailer for this film made it look like a mess. Giving us far too much information in a few seconds and turning me completely off it. I only saw it at the cinema because there was nothing else on and I'm glad I gave it a tiny chance. <p>The concept is intriguing and the execution is brilliantly done. Set at three different stages in the lives of the four main characters we are quickly familiar with the sometimes curious, sometimes devastating events that shape their lives. The relationships between Evan, Kalley, Lenny and Tommy are very well developed and it's very interesting to watch them twist and change as Evan suffers from constant black-outs, Tommy goes totally insane and Kalley and Lenny even insaner. Almost all of them end up in the nut-house at some point.<p>It's at this point that the older Evan (a horrifically bearded, pre-packaged and homogenised 'pretty boy' Ashton Kutcher) decides to time travel back to his childhood, thanks to his incredible memory (how this is achieved is never explained!!!) and put right what once went wrong. Only each time he tries he just makes things worse and worse. <p>The storylines involving the younger quartet are truly the best bits of the film. The young Tommy is one of the most evil and depraved characters I have ever seen and the younger Evan is far more interesting than his future counterpart. Whenever the film flashes forward to the college years I found it extremely lagging and wished for another time travel scene. Ashton Kutcher was far less expressive than his younger actors. <p>And am I the only one noticing several nods to Se7en? Not only do they go see the movie as kids (how they got in is never explained either but I'm assuming they got tickets for Dumb and Dumber and sneaked in) but Evan's journals (his method of time travel!) are exactly the same as John Doe's and are written in the same manner. A curious bit of trivia indeed. <p>For a film with a great story, a few scares and wonderfully (if not nicely) developed characters then seriously check this out. Tho I have one thing to ask the older Evan. What do you think is going to happen to your body if you stand in front of a mailbox being exploded by a lethal stick of dynamite???</p></br><a href="../users/A3SJSNS9LW981O.html">A3SJSNS9LW981O</a><br/><p>After reading the viewer reviews about this movie, I'm convinced that those attracted to despair, futility, and ruination have a love affair with this adventure. Pedaphiles, doggie killers, baby bombers... it's all a bit much! Some complained about the perceived "upbeat" end of the film, although I didn't see the ending as upbeat at all.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert... Having the main character sacrifice the one relationship that meant the most to him...his true love, his childhood sweetheart... this is "upbeat?" Instead, it's bittersweet... he realizes that her life would be better if she wasn't close to him. Thus, this "good" ending has a sad twist, especially when he sees his true love on the street, but forces himself to keep walking away from her.<br /><br />If the ending had him "reconnect" with his lost love, that would had been inconsistent with the rest of the film. But the sacrifice of this time traveling protagonist, as kept in the film, fits well.<br /><br />The Director's cut has Kutcher's character strangle himself as a fetus? Please! I thought "Twelve Monkeys" was a depressing time travel film. If they kept this ending, Prozac could had officially sponsored the plunge into despair.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>I think Ashton Kutcher did a good job on this film. I recall that Kutcher has never made a film like this, and his first thriller was somewhat peculiar. Not just any old thriller, this one would keep you on the edge of your seat from the start to the finish. A weird title however, but the tag line explains all. Change one thing, change everything. I think this automatically gets you thinking, and as the film proceeds, it gets harder.<br /><br />As you may all already be aware, there are two versions of the film (well the Ending) and they both have completely different appeal, for me the directors ending is superior, it is more unexpected and far more shocking, but it does end the film on a slight downer, which is why the original release was happier (even though it didn't really fit the film).</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>Compelling, thilling, original. There are just not enough words to describe the sheer genius of this movie and it's first time directors/writers. If you ask me this is one good directorial debut for these guys.<br /><br />It all starts when this little boy starts having this so-called blackouts. After the confusing lapse in time, we are brought back to a pivital event that changes his life. We, in the audience know exactly what happens after each blackout, which sometimes are very disturbing given the innuendo that comes with it. But, after getting over his blackouts and documenting his condition, he finds that he is able to rewind back in time and change the life-altering events. But even good deciscions make the worst outcomes. Throughout the movie he is forced to go back each time to change the chain of events which he set in motion. Not only is this a movie with heart, consequences and redemption but it is just a really good change of pace. It does something different. It does something original. And that you can remember for good and take to the bank. Add this mobvie to your collection and you won't regret it. See the theatrical version first if you are getting the dvd. I personally think that that one is the best version.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>For such an intriguing subject as `time travel' (using the term loosely), there are very few stories, much less movies, that can carry off the subject with an interesting approach.  `The Butterfly Effect' falls into the rank of excellence along with the movie `Donnie Darko' and the book `Replay' by Ken Grimwood.<br /><br />Evan Treborn (played surprisingly well by Aston Kutcher) has been plagued by strange memory blackouts throughout his childhood, usually occurring at traumatic times in his life.  And Evan's life is ripe with trauma.  He and his friends Kayleigh Miller (a showcase role for Amy Smart) and Lenny Kegan (Elden Henson) must deal with the problems from their childhood as they grow into adults.  For Evan, his problems are made worse by the fact that his father is insane and in a psychiatric hospital, and Evan has never met him.  When Evan does meet his father, his father tries to choke him and is killed, but Evan can't remember why because of a blackout.<br /><br />Later, while in college and free from his blackouts for over seven years, something strange happens to Evan while he is glancing through his old journals.  Spurred by this incident to try and find out more about his past, Evan visits his old friends Kayleigh and Lenny to question them.  Lenny is disturbed and still lives at home building models, and Kayleigh is working as a waitress, scarred too deep on the inside to make a better life for herself.  When Evan is informed of Kayleigh's suicide by her brutal and psychotic brother, he decides to harness the strangeness that comes from reading his journals.<br /><br />Evan finds he can go back, travel into his childhood, into the dead places left by his blacked out memory, and attempts to save Kayleigh in this way.  What follows is a taut and thrilling roller coaster ride in which for every fix Evan attempts, he changes the entire course of his life and the lives of his friends.  And before its too late, Evan needs to find a way to fix everyone, even if it means losing the only girl he's ever loved.<br /><br />Ashton Kutcher surprised me in this movie, moving from silly comedies to a serious role with a clean style and well displayed talent.  The role of Kayleigh for Amy Smart was perfect, giving her a wide variety of characterization to spiral through as Evan continues his pursuit to bring about the changes that will leave each of his friends in a better life.  Watch for Eric Stoltz as George Miller, Kayleigh's dad, in a shocking character that he performs with excellence.  More great supporting roles from Melora Walters as Evan's mom Andrea, Elden Henson as Lenny, and the perfectly done character of Thumper, played by the talented Ethan Suplee (John Q, Evolution).<br /><br />`The Butterfly Effect' is not an action packed thriller, but you will still be glued to your set, watching how events unfold in different and unexpected ways, adding twists now and than that will leave you changing your mind about certain characters and crossing your fingers for Evan, Kayleigh, Lenny, and Tommy.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT is an oddly controversial film.  Marketed as a star turn for Ashton Kutcher, it is more a film that, despite its big budget and excessive special effects, should have played the small art theaters.  Well, now, in the solitude of the home, the film can be watched for what it really is - an interesting concept based on the Chaos Theory: one tiny event can have cosmic end effects. The title references this theory: the flutter of a butterfly wing can result in a chain of events that may end in a huge, destructive windstorm.  The writers and directors of this film use a rather sophisticated example of a young man haunted by past events he recorded in journals only to find he is able to 'relive' those series of bad events, change one thing, and alter the outcome of the initial deed.  It just happens that his blackouts/memory lapses/time travels don't always make things better and it is only a final act of change/contrition that he is able to put the bad histories to rest. Yes, it is a bit sci-fi in technique, but it also elicits participation from the viewer who must concentrate to walk the maze created by the victim/perpetrator/madman/savior. The cast is well chosen and Kutcher for the most part is able to overcome his history of pretty boy, inane previous roles to make Evan (the history-altering proponent of the Chaos Theory) credible - and that says a lot.  The others in the cast do well with some occasional rather dreary dreadful roles inherent in the story, and while one wishes the cinematography/special effects could have been more sophisticated, the mood of the film remains unbroken until the rather surprising ending (Director's Cut version).  In other words, what on the surface may seem a glitzy, silly movie is actually a thinking person's film.  Give it a chance.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>The idea that the world around you would change -- perhaps dramatically -- if you changed something in your past goes back at least to the 1946 classic, &quot;It's a Wonderful Life.&quot; In &quot;Butterfly Effect&quot; this theme gets beaten to death (as is one of the characters in the movie, at least on one timeline).<br /><br /> Many reviewers have erroneously called this a &quot;time travel&quot; movie; it's really more of an examination of what might happen in one young man's life if he had the ability to project his adult persona back into the past and alter events in his childhood. And boy, does he have reason to do so! There's a lot of grim stufff back there!<br /><br /> Overall, the movie works fairly well, although it's pretty heavy-handed and Ashton Kutcher is no great shakes of an actor. He handles the lead role passably well, but it's no Oscar-level performance. And there are some places where Evan does things that are obviously stupid even at the time he does them; it's almost as if Kutcher's &quot;Kelso&quot; character from &quot;That '70s Show&quot; has taken over. Still, if you like movies of this genre, you'll probably be willing to overlook them. And Amy Smart shines as the ever-changing Kayley.<br /><br /> If you're expecting greatness, look elsewhere. But if you just want passable entertainment with a smidge of thought-provoking ideas mixed in -- and you don't mind depictions of violence directed against children and animals -- &quot;Butterfly Effect&quot; fills the bill.<br /><br /> PS: Of the two versions on this DVD, I personally preferred the version released in theatres.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>While &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; wasn't critically acclaimed or well loved by everyone, I thought it was a pretty good movie when I first saw it at the theatres.  It was a dark and completely disturbing film that made me want to look away at times, but at the same time I was very intrigued.  My only problem was the ending.  I thought it really contradicted the whole theme of the movie, but I always suspected that the so-called &quot;happy ending&quot; was forced upon since the movie is so dark and hard to watch that they thought there was no way people would like it if a more darker and depressing ending were added.  Well, now you get to see the director's cut of the film that's on this very DVD, which offers the superior ending.<p>Evan had terrible blackouts when he was little, very much like his father.  He would blackout during terrible situations and not remember anything.  That's when it was suggested to him that he keep a journal to see if he could remember what happened during those blackouts.  When Evan is all grown up, still haunted by his terrible past that had blanketed him and his friends, he discovers that he can relive those memories when he reads his entries.  He can view it like a movie and finally see what had happened during his blackouts.  Not only that, but he has the power to even alter those moments.  Determined to fix the pasts of him and his friends, he relives those memories and tries to fix them so they will all have a better future.  However, when he tries to change one thing, it leads to devastating results that he could have never foreseen.  As the cover says, &quot;Change one thing... change EVERYTHING.&quot;<p>I found this film to be very interesting and complex, even though I felt that the film itself was not perfect.  The movie is very hard to watch at times, so it's not recommended for those who don't like being disturbed or who are extremely sensitive to such matters.  I think it has a smart storyline and great acting.  Believe it or not, Ashton Kutcher is able to act in a serious role.  I didn't even recognize him at first, but he really pulled it off.  He was able to convince me that he was in fact &quot;Evan,&quot; as he played the role with determination and force.<p>As I said in the beginning, my major problem with the movie had always been the ending.  While it was happy and nice to see that things worked out considering the absolute hell this movie can put you through, I still found the ending to be contradictive and a &quot;cop-out.&quot;  Now, all of that's changed as you are given the choice to either watch the theatrical version, OR the director's cut.  The director's cut offers a few more extra minutes that adds more substance to the story (including an interesting find) and a more appropriate ending.  If you were to ask me which version is better, I'd say that the director's cut is without any hesitation  The new ending does a better job of fitting in with the theme of the movie and doesn't contradict the film as the theatrical ending does.  The DVD also offers &quot;infinifilm&quot; features that give you a deeper insight to the movie itself.  Extras included are commentary, documentaries, storyboard galleries and much more.  I must say that the film looks great, and also sounds fantastic as well.<p>&quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; proves to be an even stronger film with the director's cut version, even if it's still not a perfect movie.  If you're looking for something a little more darker and sinister than your regular picks, then this is something to consider.  Just remember that this movie does not let you off easy.  It's brutal and extremely disturbing.  If you're daring and think you can handle it, then pick this up and prepare for one unforgettable and chilling ride. -Michael Crane</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2 Have you ever wondered how differently your life might have turned out had you taken a left turn instead of a right on the day of that fateful accident, or chosen a different college or career path, or not gone to that dance the night you met your one true love?  All of us have played this "what if" game at some point in our lives, speculating about where we might be, whom we might know and what we might be doing now if even a single event in our past had played out differently.  And how many of us would be willing to return to a key moment in our past if we knew that, by doing something different, we could forever alter the path our life ended up taking?  And what if we discovered that by undoing that event we ended up altering our lives and the lives of those around us in ways we never expected?  Would we still want to do it?<br /><br />This is the premise for "The Butterfly Effect," an effectively creepy supernatural thriller that boasts a star-making performance by Ashton Kutcher.  Kutcher plays Evan Treborn, a young man in college who, since his childhood, has been suffering inexplicable blackouts at key traumatic moments in his life.  And traumatic his life has been!  His father is consigned to a mental institution, suffering from an ailment that may have been passed on to his son.  In addition, Evan is friends with a young girl, Kayley, whose father sexually abuses not only her but Evan as well.  Kayley also has a sadistic little brother named Lenny, who inspires Evan, Kayley and a neighbor friend of theirs to perform malicious pranks and even sets Evan's dog on fire.  Now that he's in college, Evan discovers he has the power to transport himself back in time to many of these key moments in his life in an attempt to rewrite history and undo the mental and psychological damage they've caused.  The trouble is that Evan finds out that changing the course of history often brings a whole host of other unforeseen and unanticipated problems right along with it.<br /><br />Directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber have fashioned a complex, intricate screenplay filled with plot twists that continually alter the plane of the film's reality.  The story hurtles us back and forth in time, showing us what was, what is and then what might have been without a moment's confusion, all the while making us question whether Evan isn't simply insane after all.  There are a few, perhaps inevitable, plot holes, the most glaring of which is why Evan is unable to find out how a prank he and his friends committed in their childhood turned tragically wrong (Evan blacked out during the event).  Considering the fact that the tragedy was one that became common knowledge in the small town in which Evan lived, it is highly implausible that he would have to wait till his early `20's before he finally found out what had happened.  In addition, one might question the propriety of using a topic as sensitive as pedophilia for a supernatural thriller.  Still, those are minor quibbles for a story that works remarkably well at keeping itself credible and focused despite the inherent absurdity at its core.<br /><br />Kutcher does an effective job carrying the film.  By not being too handsome or too heroic, Kutcher keeps Evan life-sized and interesting.  We're willing to follow him through this elaborate labyrinth because we can identify with the truths of his character.  He's a young man who genuinely wants to make things better for the people he cares for, yet the mental anguish he is going through as he attempts to piece together some semblance of comprehensible reality from the jumbled fragments of his life comes through loud and clear.<br /><br />"The Butterfly Effect" is not your usual mind-numbing, schlock thriller.  It has intelligence and style and a very intriguing storyline.  It will probably get you rewinding some of those key events in your own life, wondering might have been.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FEQXNCFC68KC.html">A3FEQXNCFC68KC</a><br/><p>The Butterfly Effect is a pretty cerebral science fiction movie that seems like it's pretending to be one of those trendy MTV-styled thrillers. On the surface you have Ashton Kutcher and other good looking kids going from scene to scene with cool music in the background and such... which is fine for bringing in that crowd. What I really liked about the movie were the questions that it was raising about Ashton's character and what he can do: if you can go back and change your past what implications would come of it? The Butterfly Effect pulls this off almost perfectly.<br /><br />The movie spends a fair amount of time in the beginning establishing Evan's (Ashton) life as a youth and all of the serious problems he faced. This is some intense stuff. You really get pulled down in the mud in these scenes and get a good idea of how messed up Evan's life was and how much he had to overcome to get to Ashton's age. By then his need to change his past, along with his ability to, gets the movie started to the point. Is this beginning long and drawn out? Does it pull you too far from the direction the movie ultimately goes? No way. While it does go off on a tangent of sorts that's exactly what you need.<br /><br />The rest of the film deals with his jumping back and forth to his past, trying to change it for the better, and having to deal with the results. This is the meat of the movie and this is where you see the complications between dealing with a traumatic past and how much worse it can be trying to fix it. Ashton didn't get a lot of praise for his performance in this movie, which is sad. Although his face is unforgettable from his past exploits he didn't come off as That 70's Show's Kelso or the host of MTV's Punk'd in any way. He really showed his acting chops in this movie.<br /><br />The special effects on this movie played well with things like its time/space warping scenes. Cinematography is worth noting too. Different eras of Evan's life seem to be depicted with different lens filters and other camera tricks that give the scenes a very signature look. All in all a very solid production.<br /><br />Now the theatrical release has an ending different from the director's original vision. If you ask me they made a good choice with the theatrical ending. It makes more sense and it fits better in the overall theme of the movie. The alternate ending goes way out there on left field, even with the director's cut filling in little scenes that are supposed give foreshadowing for that ending. It's just a lame ending in my opinion. There are lot of people who say they prefer the alternate ending and I can only think they do because it's such a radical departure from conventional endings.<br /><br />Now this Blu-Ray release is actually an import and doesn't come with any special features and whatnot other than enhanced picture. As a matter of fact this release will only have the director's cut of the movie and the theatrical release is not there at all. That includes the director's "alternate ending". This sucks for people who want to compare between the theatrical and director's cut as they are pretty different on how they end (and believe me that makes all the difference).<br /><br />The Butterfly Effect is a great movie, but this Blu-Ray release isn't. No extra features. No commentary. No both versions of the movie. It's better to wait for a better release or just get the Infinifilm edition DVD, which has both versions, deleted scenes, documentaries and more.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>The Butterfly Effect is a stunning thriller about a young man(Ashton Kutcher) who discovers he has the psychic power to literally relive his childhood traumatic memories.  Obsessed with getting things right between him and his girlfriend in the present, Kutcher just keeps making things worse, to the growing horror and fascination of the viewer.<p>Kutcher's dark and powerful performance is a far cry from his That 70's Show.  One look into his dark, haunted eyes tells you that you will see this young man again on the big screen.  <p>The Butterfly Effect is most profound in the implications it has for our own lives, and the lives of those you love.  This movie has one of the most powerful and moving endings ever.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>To begin with, if one is to enjoy this film, one has to suspend disbelief, as the plot turns upon the ability to relive one's past and change it. This is a film that will appeal to those who enjoy seeing films or reading books that thematically deal with alternate realities or time travel.<br /><br />  The butterfly effects refers to the chaos theory in physics. The bottom line is that every action has a reaction, often one that is seemingly unpredictable. That is probably the keyword to describe this compelling and intense film that is filled with complex relationships. Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher), a college student interested in psychology, discovers for himself just how unpredictable life can be, when he finds a way to go back into his troubled past to try to right what went wrong with him and his three childhood friends, Lenny, Kayleigh, and her twin brother, Tommy. Unfortunately, the best intentions often go awry. Despite traveling back a numer of times into his past, each alternate reality has its own nightmarish permutations.<br /><br />  This is an inventive, creative, well-done film with excellent performances by the entire cast. While Ashton Kutcher gives a fine, sensitive performance as the angst ridden Evan Treborn, he is, however, outshone by the two child actors who play the role of Evan Treborn as a seven year old (Logan Lerman) and as a thirteen year old (John Patrick Amedori). In fact, three talented sets of actors play the roles of Evan and his three childhood friends at ages seven, thirteen, and as young adults.<br /><br />Melora Walters gives a well-nuanced performance as Andrea Treborn, Evan's mother. Amy Smart gives a wonderful performance as the adult Kayleigh Miller, a very special childhood friend and the love of Evan's life, who acts as the catalyst for his entry into the wacky world of alternate realities. Jesse James gives a riveting performance as the thirteen years old Tommy Miller, Kayleigh's psychotic twin brother. Look for Eric Stoltz in the small, pivotal role of Mr. Miller, Kayleigh's father, whose fresh faced looks belie a man steeped in perversion and cruelty.<br /><br />  Writers-directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber provide a fresh and inventive script with labyrinthine twists and turns that, coupled with deft direction, give rise to a compelling, mind bending film that will keep the viewer riveted to the screen. This is definitely a film that one will want to view more than once, as the DVD provides both the director's cut and the theatrical release and is packed with many extras. Those film lovers who have a penchant for alternate realities or time travel themes will certainly want to add this film to their personal collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>I have two responses to this film: an emotional one, and an intellectual one.<br /><br />My emotional response is that all of the actors played their roles with such convincing strength, and that the quality of direction was at such a high level that it was relatively easy to suspend disbelief (necessary in a film such as this). Even though many of the situations ? specifically the taboo situations ? were tired clich?-ridden retreads, my emotional responses to them were powerful. (During the film, that is. As I rethink them, I?m disgusted at myself for having powerful reactions to such tired retreads that offered no new explorations.)<br /><br />The concept of the film ? an exploration into how our choices affect the outcome of our lives ? is, if not an original concept, always an interesting one. This film is, essentially, a macrocosmic exploration of that question.<br /><br />Intellectually, however, my reaction is slightly different. We learn the likely reason for Evan?s blackouts as a child later in the film, but the explanation isn?t explored beyond that single connection. I consider that a considerable flaw, because when you start to piece each blackout with the supposed event that caused it, they don?t all add up. Moreover, much has been made of the quality of the drawing that Evan made as a seven year old. When we approach the end of the film, we understand what the painting represents. We also see that it wasn?t really a seven year old Evan that was drawing that. However, that disrupts the films prescribed timelines and organization as if nuclear fusion were occurring at its core. How could Evan, at that particular point in the film, possibly know what the sum total of his choices was going to be? Also, his father AND his grandfather possessed the same abilities as Evan? That?s a bit hard to swallow.<br /><br />Still, it was an interesting film to watch. Better than I thought, but not as good as it could have been.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>"The Butterfly Effect" was a great film despite it's negative reviews from reviewers in the newspapers and such.Ashton Kutcher whose performance people have insulted alot did a pretty good job in the film although he's no where near Oscar nominations.<br />But the film is about Alex Treborne(Kutcher) whose childwood was severley damaged and now an A student in college he begins to read his childhood journals in an attempt to recreate the the childhood all in the hopes of saving his girlfriend Kaylie (Amy Smart).The flashbacks are very interesting getting you hooked on the story right away and the characters are well casted with Kutcher perfectly fit for the role.Also smaller characters are great too such as a kiddie pornographer played by Eric Stoltz.<br />The film was very entertaining from the first frame to fade out and was worth the six dollars and fifty cents it cost to get in.<br />Go see this film,you are not wasting your money.But another thing I should bring up is the fact that this is not really what you would call a horror film,it is more of a drama but it will be likeable for horror freaks.B+ for the movie,B for the acting.<br />Enjoy!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3HQXFLZ6WI70Q.html">A3HQXFLZ6WI70Q</a><br/><p>When I first saw this movie, I was amazed that Kelso could act.

The emotional pay-off is quite profound (especially in the director's cut, much better than the theatrical edition), though viewers are advised that the material is often VERY heavy indeed - you have been warned! An unexpected masterpiece.<br /><br />Followed by several in-name-only sequels, beginning with THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT 2 (2006).</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>When I saw the theatrical movie preview of this film in Cinemark 22, I thought it would be interesting to see.  When the movie came out, with the help of a good publicist, managers and agent, suddenly the name "Ashton Kutcher" was everywhere on television.  Of course we know him from "The 70's Show" tv series, but everyday on tabloid television we heard about Ashton Kutcher.  Then when we saw him with his girlfriend, well that was the top of the cake.  More publicity.  The only way Kutcher got knocked out of the news was when it was announced (Pardon me for saying this.  This is quite a shock) Chris Rock was going to host the 77th Academy Awards.<br />  After recovering from that, I put off seeing this film and waited months before I finally decided it was time to see it on DVD.  "Additional Scenes" and both versions theatrical and "Director's Cut" on one disc peaked my interest.<br />  Evan (Logan Lerman) has had some real horrifing things happen in his young life so far.  He visits his real father who is in a psycho ward.  The visit starts normal, but suddenly when he opens his eyes, he sees his father trying to ring his neck in full anger.<br />  The neighbor kids are with Evan (John Patrick Amedori).  They want to blow up a mailbox with an explosive.  They wait for the explosion.  When Evan comes to, he someone is in the woods.  Evan has blackouts.  He doesn't know what has just happened. he keeps a diary of his blackouts.  Nobody will tell him what has happened while he is out, so he still doesn't know.  It bothers him.  A solution to the problem, him and his parents move away.<br />  Now in college, Evan (Ashton Kutcher) hasn't had a blackout in seven years.  A date finds his diary and he begins to read it.  Suddenly the horrible memories come back to him.  He now knows how he blacked-out and the lost memories are now returning much to his horror.  He goes back to his old hometown to get answers with some horrifing effects.<br />  This DVD version gives you the chance to see the "theatrical version" or the "Director's Cut" version with a different ending.<br />  "Infinifilm" can be chosen to play during either versions while you watch the film,  deleted scenes, casting, storyboards and alternate scenes.<br />  The theatrical version and ending is better.

The premise of the film, the mood of impending doom, and the fact that you really do end up caring about the characters more than make up for its shortcomings.

Debuting directors J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress create an interesting and intricate film, dealing with the chaos theory.  The theory that the flapping of a butterfly's wings can cause a typhoon halfway across the world. Okay, yes critics have without a doubt just panned this movie but it has pulled off a few positive and mixed reviews.  This movie may be a good enough and maybe even smart enough self-help thriller.  Some viewers may be drawn away from the intensity of it, let me say that first off it does make sense you just need to PAY ATTENTION.  It's an neat time-travel thriller, with some fine performances and effects.  The CGI is fine, not terrible as some people have said.<br />  Now analyzing Kutcher's performance is one hell of a fun assessment, sure it was good.  I'm serious, he can act and it's nice to see him turn from his childish and immature comic roles even though he is a riot.  This has been a great movie to start off the year and I'm pleased in seeing it.  The beautiful Amy Smart plays Kutcher's childhood freind and later on his love interest.<br />  The Butterfly Effect is rated R for Violence, Language, Sexual Content and Brief Drug Use.  The violence includes prison violence with intense fistfights in addition to other beatings.  There are some bloody images not exceptionally graphic.  There are implied sexual situations along with sexual innuendo.  There is also is profanity not especially strong or explicit, smoking and marijuana use.  I'm not too sure I could this an intellectual thriller, but it does make you think in some ways, it's entertaining and even initially intruiging at times.  I should also warn you that this is a reasonably disturbing movie, some of the images are pretty displeasing.  It's a bit dark and gloomy but a fine film and worth viewing in theatres.  Not a bad pick for owning on Video or DVD and would definetly make a good rental.</p></br><a href="../users/AO4J90YPX5RU6.html">AO4J90YPX5RU6</a><br/><p>~The Butterfly Effect~ proves that actor Ashton Kutcher is capable of much more than just your average screw ball comedy such as ~Just Married~ and ~Dude, Where's my Car?~. Not to say that those films aren't okay for what they are, it's just that this movie delivers. It's a sure crowd pleaser. Some may have a hard time following it at first but hang out, it explains itself in due time. Do you remember the rules in 1985's ~Back to the Future~ when it comes to time travel? One false move can change everything. This movie has a field day with making those false moves and the pros and most often cons that are involved. ~The Butterfly Effect~ goes from the present to the past repeatedly. All in an effect to assure the right future. There is an alternate ending. This is the ending for the director's cut. I like the version that was released in theaters. The director's cut takes the movie a step futher, but I think the non-director's cut was more pleasing for me. I've recommended this film to many others, if you haven't seen it and you're interested.. give it a shot.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>The theory of chaos is a very passionate subject. Right between your eyes a little twist of the state of the things can make affect an entire life: yours or another one. It's a big puzzle where the lines are intersected by minuscule connections as a whole nervous system: even the maxim disorder has its own pattern. If you wish to turn back any little piece of this complex and unexpected mechanism ruled by capricious laws you can open Pandora's box.<br /><br />How many possible resolutions may an event have? . That's why the history can not accept such coin in this values' market. You rearrange a little detail and the whole destiny changes suddenly before your eyes. It's like make possible scenarios inside an unknown future. You can control and even reduce your weakness and increase your strengths, but the rest of the uncertainness is still dark. What about with the menaces and opportunities: these are variables which live outside your control. You can not handle them.<br /><br />Interesting and very well built script that leaves you thinking: you can not alter a fact to rescue a destiny without avoiding worst or better consequences derived from the best of your goodwill.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>The basic idea of &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; appeals to me.  I remember the Ray Bradbury short story where the guy goes back in time to shoot a T-Rex and changes the future because he comes back with a butterfly on his boot and enjoyed watching Sam trying to set the past to rights on &quot;Quantum Leap.&quot;  But the story from co-writers and co-directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber also resonates with me because of an idea I had for short story about a rich guy who wants the Confederacy to win the Civil War.  He sits in the time machine trying to select the right moment to go back and change history; he only has one shot and he sits there, going over all the options (e.g., assassinate Lincoln years earlier, help Pickett's charge succeed), unable to decide which would guarantee success.<p>However, in &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; it turns out that Evan (Ashton Kutcher) has multiple opportunities for changing his past, although actally it is the past of Kayleigh Miller (Amy Smart) that he wants to change.  But his also means changing the past of Kayleigh's brother, Tommy (William Lee Scott) and their friend, Lenny (Elden Henson), as well as Evan's mother (Melora Walters) and his college roommate (Ethan Suplee).  The problem is that every time he changes the past things do not necessarily get better as new problems are presented.  But Evan keeps trying to find the magic solution that will set everything to rights, or at least what he thinks would be the best of all possible worlds.<p>Evan and his friends had a trouble childhood.  &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; takes place mainly in the present, but it also involves going back to when the kids were 7 and discovered that Mr. Miller (Eric Stolz) was a sicko and when they were 13 and something equally horrible happened.  The first time we visit these events we do not know everything that happened because Evan does not remember; as a child he was afflicted with blackouts and since the film is told from his perspective we follow suit.  Evan's mother is worried that he might have the same mental illness as his father, but Dr. Redfield (Nathaniel DeVaux) does not think so and has Evan start keeping a journal.  <p>In college Evan discovers that when he reads the journal entries he wrote in the past he can go back to that moment in time and that he can control what he says and does, thereby changing the present.  This is certainly an interesting way of engaging in time travel (cf. Christopher Reeves thinks his way to the past in &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;) and I think &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; is a rather ambitious time travel film that is trying to be intelligent in terms of both the theory at work and the construction of the story.  This is one of those films where you can better appreciate it the second time around, even if you do all the Infinifilm options, especially once you understand the rules for the game.  <p>In the end I am not sure if it is because the intelligence of the story by Bress and Gruber is not up to their ambition, but you cannot fault the effort.  One of the strengths of this film is how it takes it time, as Evan wrestles with not only the changes in his world but struggles to figure out what he can do to make everything better the next time around.  This is certainly superior to their previous effort, &quot;Final Destination 2&quot; and it will be interesting to see what they come up with next if they continue along this path.  As for performances I would say that Amy Smart's is the best of the bunch and as for Ashton Kutcher, I know he is usually regarded as a tabloid joke or a television pretty boy, but this was actually the first film I have seen when I liked his character or his performance.  He might be a forgotten actor by the end of the decade, but he gets props for showing some ambition.  But in the final analysis this is Bress and Gruber's film and everybody is just along for the ride.<p>I watched the director's cut (or, I guess, the directors' cut) before seeing the original theatrical ending or the two alternative endings (&quot;Stalker&quot; and &quot;Happy Sappy&quot;) and at this point would have to say the first one I saw is the best of the bunch.  That is because while the effect remains the same the cause in the original theatrical release is just too simplistic after the complicated setup.  Granted, the preferred version is rather dark and twisted, but if you listen to any of the commentary on the DVD you will understand their reasoning.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ATTCCO32ZXET.html">A3ATTCCO32ZXET</a><br/><p>"Oh goodie, another teenage movie featuring the pretty-boy-of-the-moment", was my thought when my husband brought home The Butterfly Effect last night.  He rarely picks anything I would have, although about half the time his selections surprise me by being good.  Happily this turned out to be one of those situations.<p>TBE is about a boy growing up under a peculiar curse; he has occasional blackouts, during which he does things that he cannot remember afterwards and which usually traumatize everybody around him.  They often come at key moments of his life that end up in disaster before he comes back to himself.  CAT scans of his brain show no organic disorder.  Hypnosis doesn't reveal much.  His mom and circle of friends learn to accept him and cope with him, and he grows up with some strong friendships until he has to move at age 14.  That's the last he hears from them until he revisits childhood sweetheart seven years later.  Her life has been a downward spiral since he left and after he leaves this time she commits suicide.  Remorse drives him to reexamine his childhood journals for clues and answers to why things got so bad, and he makes a disturbing discovery:  he can travel back in time to those blackout periods and redo them.  The question now becomes, should he?  Because on every one of those "trips", his tampering has unexpected, horrible results for one or more of his loved ones.<p>I never used to think much of Ashton Kutcher, for better or for ill, but TBE changed my mind about him.  He proved that he can play a smart, compelling character with a good range of emotions.  I believe that Kutcher may have a future in Hollywood aside from the himbo roles he's been stuck with up until now.  Let's hope some casting directors agree.<p>My final opinion of TBE is that it is a somewhat dark, but well done film.  The plot is not perfect (toward the end there is a big plot hole that I won't reveal so I don't spoil it for you) but it does raise intelligent questions for the viewer to ponder on the long-term consequences of everything we do and what moments in our lives really decide who we will become.  It was also engaging on a more gut level that I can't explain, but I enjoyed the entire hour and fifty five minutes.

After seeing him on &quot;That 70's Show,&quot; &quot;Punk'D&quot; and the deliciously stupid &quot;Dude Where's My Car?&quot; I was ready to see what the serious side of him could bring to the table. What I got with this film is more than I had bargained for. Sure, the previews promised a lot (and delivered on it), but this film is one of the most intense and gripping movies I have seen in a long time. First time directors  J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress do an outstanding job with the material, and although the initial premise is far-fetched, it's forgiven because of how the story sucks you in and makes you feel involved. Kutcher plays Evan Treborn, a college student with a dark past, who can't remember key moments in his life because he simply blacked them out. He is told his dad is crazy, and as a child, sees him die. Evan's doctor told him to start writing journals when he was seven years old and when he reads a passage in the present day about a moment that he blacked out, he finds himself in a dream-like state where he is reliving the moment he couldn't remember. After a few experiences, Evan figures he can control these dreams and try to change things and maybe create a better future for him and his three childhood friends: Tommy (William Lee Scott), Lenny (Elden Henson) and most importantly, the girl he has loved since as long as he can remember (Tommy's twin sister) Kayleigh (Amy Smart). However, everytime Evan goes back in time, things in the present get shifted around severely, and most of the time, end up the worst. Evan finds himself going from frathouse to prison to wheelchair and each time he experiments, his window of hope for saving his friends seems to be waning. The most powerful scenes involve Evan's childhood, where we slowly watch how deranged Tommy can get, how disturbed Lenny can get, and how messed up Kayleigh's life can get. All of the actors in this film turn out exceptional performances. Obviously Kutcher does a great job, and is natural as Evan. But props must go to the underrated Amy Smart, who plays so many different characters in this movie and covers so much area. You can tell she put a lot into the role and it translates onto the screen. The movie (well, the theatrical cut) revolves around the love-story between Evan and Kayleigh, and basically serves as Evan's motivation. This movie is a bit disturbing, if you have certain childhood scars that you would rather not bring up, I wouldn't recommend this movie. But the bottom-line is &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; is a great movie and exceeds all expectations. The Director's Cut found on this DVD, is basically the original movie, with some cut-scenes pasted here and there (and it's easy to see why some of these were cut) and a completely different ending. Personally, I liked the original ending better. It just seems to end perfectly, exactly the way it should. But The Director's Cut, while being risky and bold, just doesn't seem to fit. But, it's all open for interpretation. The extras are somewhat disappointing. The extra deleted scenes are always nice and the commentary from the directors is rather interesting, but there isn't much else going on.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"The Butterfly Effect" is one of the best well made movies in recent history.

Mackye GruberEvan's attempt at the time-travelling, life-altering thriller.  At times the film succeeds as a compelling drama, but the film is not supported by solid acting, a complete, cohesive script, and formidable direction and execution.  Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher in a fairly sedated performance), as a young boy, endured a few childhood trauma along with his three childhood friends, Kallie, Tommy, and Lenny, such as his friend's pedophile father (played eerily by Eric Stoltz). Evan has some kind of problem, however, that causes him to blackout during these traumatic, life changing events. These past events obviously effect the present as they mold the person the four children will become and it isn't always pretty.  As a psychology major, Evan is inspired to study memory patterns, and consequently, discovers his neurological knack for forcing himself to remember things. When he does, he is able to transplant himself back to that time (through the help of his journals that he kept since he was 7) and, still knowing what he knows in the present, is able to alter the past, and also the present. So, his goal is to make all of his friends' and mother's lives at least as perfect as they can be by wiping out as much of the bad stuff as he possibly can. But not everything works well on the first try. In other words, it is an opportunity to be able to "redo" his past. Evan is able to give everyone a second (and third, and fourth) chance at life.<br /><br />The main problem with "The Butterfly Effect" is that it doesn't transcend this level but simply thinks that it does. The chain reaction of events that result from Evan's actions may be drastic, but there is nothing unpredictable about them. He affects crucial events in his life and the result are straightforward, logical consequenced, hardly akin to stepping on an insect and changing the course of man. The writers could have used far more imagination when devising the plot. Other changes that the character makes are unconvincing, such as the notion that he could prevent the Eric Stoltz character from abusing his daughter by simply threatening him on one occasion, a scene that again misses the point. It's not a good example of little things affecting the world in big ways. It's an example of wishful thinking, plain and simple. When the scenario finally goes wrong, it happens because of the way Kutcher's character acts in the altered present, not because of the altered time-line itself.<br /><br />The film's first forty-five minutes are somewhat more promising. These early scenes deal with Kutcher's childhood experiences, how he blacks out whenever his life becomes too traumatic. It's an intriguing setup that would have left me wondering where the story was headed had I not already seen the trailer, where I learned that it was going to be about time travel. On a dramatic level, the movie's biggest failing is that it never follows through with the tone it sets up in the beginning. We're promised a thriller, but the movie degenerates into what can best be described as an episodic black comedy, almost a dark version of "Bedazzled."  Ultimately, this movie has nothing new to contribute to the time travel genre. While it tries to pass itself off as a twist on the old premise, it quickly becomes a fairly routine thriller about a man tweaking his past. I hope that the next time they decide to do such a film, they'll leave cool metaphors like butterfly effects to a script that is truly willing to deal with such concepts instead of simply pretending to.</p></br><a href="../users/A28GCEHD00JFZG.html">A28GCEHD00JFZG</a><br/><p>The Butterfly Effect: 4 out of 10: The first 40 minutes of The Butterfly Effect are tough sledding. It's not incompetent film-making mind you. If anything the film is simply too effective. Literally showing the world's worst childhood. It is so much of a downer with its child molestation, its baby killing and, most unforgivingly, its burning puppies; that it is almost a Stephen King parody rather than an actual science fiction drama.<br /><br />I guess there is a reason we repress memories after all. I would repress this childhood as well.<br /><br />The film to that point kind of reminded me of Sleepers in that it was so unpleasant to experience that it simply doesn't matter how good the movie really is. Then the movie takes a wild turn as Ashton Kutcher shows up as the adult version of our protagonist.. As easy a target as he is I hate to admit the second two-thirds of the film are really not his fault.<br /><br />Some notes to writer/directors Eric Briss and J. Mackye Gruber. If your going to have scenes in a prison you might want to visit one first, or at least watch a documentary on the same. Speaking of documentaries "Revenge of the Nerds" and other eighties comedies are not a documentaries on college life. Sororities do not resemble the Playboy Mansion. And twenty-three year old crack whores often look bad, but they tend not to resemble a Dawn of the Dead extra.<br /><br />If The Butterfly Effect didn't keep flashing back to the puppy and baby horrors, then the second two thirds would be a hoot. There is even a "hey there is a psycho chasing me lets take a walk in the dark woods" scene.<br /><br />To add injury to insult, since Kutcher's time travel effects only his friends and family and nothing else at all. The Butterfly Effect inadvertently substantiates the reverse of the Butterfly theorem.<br /><br />Needless to say the change in tone from the childhood scenes and adult scenes is jarring. Though most of the humor in the adult scenes is admittedly unintentional.<br /><br />Kutcher travels back in time by staring at notebook paper. I tried the same technique staring at my screen. It didn't work I still lost two hours.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>I really question those who think this movie was well acted.  There were too many scenes when Ashton looked like he was seconds from bursting out laughing.  And what about that one scene when he performed that weird clown run down the hall?  It also felt a bit long.  Honestly there were too many painfully acted scenes, but I do give the screenwriter props for an interesting concept and I think the director's cut ending was bold and won another star from me.</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>The Butterfly Effect abounded in creative plotlines, but I found the first third of this movie so slow-moving I almost gave up, and I'm someone with a surplus of focusable attention. It was nice to see Ashton Kutcher making the leap to the big screen and I give him full credit for putting his all into a difficult role. I liked the idea that by going back in time and trying to make things better, tiny deeds can set off unforeseen changes to everything that might come after. (Ray Bradbury used this theme well in his classic short story A Sound of Thunder.) In The Butterfly Effect, Kutcher's character returns again and again to his own past in order to try to right the wrongs that ruined the lives of a girl he loved, that girl's emotionally-unstable brother, and a third friend, who also goes on to a pathetic future that can be directly traced to the same key moments. The catch is, of course, that with each interference into the timeline, ripple effects occur and while certain areas of the existence of the four might improve, overall there are unacceptable consequences that inspire yet another trip backward. One weakness to this film was that there was little explanation or exploration of exactly how Kutcher's character was undertaking these jaunts into the past. That was left wide open and wasn't covered very well at all. I can respect saying that something "just is" and going on from there, but it still would have been nice had the means of his ability been fleshed out just a bit more. I also wondered why if the flashbacks to childhood were set (as revealed on a tombstone) in 1995, a relatively recent year, the hairstyles and fashions of the kids looked more like they were from the early `80's. Maybe a subtle effort to give the impression of distance between the latter-day events and the tragedies of once upon a time? Overall The Butterfly Effect was neither great science fiction nor a moving love story but it wasn't visual junk food either. I'll give it five stars for intention, three for what this production ultimately pulled off.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>A troubled young boy with the memory issues (Ashton Kutcher) is suddenly able to transport himself back into moments from his past, change them for the better and return to the present. The changes he makes affect not only his life but the lives of his close friends. The problem is - he never knows how exactly the changes made in the past would affect the present. The idea of the movie is anything but new - we all read Ray Bradbury's "A Sound of Thunder," an unforgettable short story about a time-traveler who steps on a prehistoric butterfly and causes the horrible changes in the fate of the whole humanity. We've seen the films Frequency, Groundhog Day, and Memento - Butterfly Effect borrows a lot from them. BE is not as good as they are but it is a compelling and intriguing movie about making choices and taking responsibilities. I recommend watching director's cut with the ending completely different from the theatrical release. The ending that I saw really made this movie for me.<br /><br />Very respectable even if not completely successful effort for Kutcher to do something different than Cheaper by the Dozen (2003), My Boss's Daughter (2003), and Just Married (2003).<br /><br />3.5/5 or 7/10</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>What would you do if you were able to go back in time to change something that would effect your present?<br /><br />The Butterfly Effect examines that question and comes up with outrageous results.<br /><br />Ashton Kutcher (A Lot Like Love) stars as Evan, a young man who is able to seizure his way back and forth through time using events that he had recorded in his dairy as his destination. His love and compassion towards his childhood sweetheart Kayleigh, played by Amy Smart, drives him to make amends and alterations to his dreadful and dark past to secure a happy life with her, but Evan is in for one shocking result after another as his alterations turn on him.<br /><br />The movie features a supporting cast including Eric Stoltz (Pulp Fiction) as Kayleigh's perverted dad, and Melora Walters (Magnolia) as Evan's mother.<br /><br />Despite The Butterfly Effect's dark premise and cliched script, it succeeds in becoming an engaging spectacle of butterfly proportions!<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />B</p></br><a href="../users/A2BEU7GPGNIG44.html">A2BEU7GPGNIG44</a><br/><p>I think the concept of this film was interesting.  I enjoyed the film but at times I felt it was a little slow.  It was good, I was expecting something different the way some of the critics panned the film but it was a good film.  It's one of those films you might want to watch once or twice to really get it.  I enjoyed it although after Evan made the first altering change the film slowed down a bit.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>I liked Ashton Kutcher in his &quot;Punk'd&quot; series, but not so much in his other shows. In this film, though, he really shows a wide range of acting. The story pulls you in and twists you up. It is not a generic copy of any other films, although it could be a mix of a bunch of them (think &quot;Dreamscape&quot;, &quot;Flatliners&quot;, &quot;Sixth Sense&quot;, &quot;Sliders&quot; and even &quot;Blair Witch&quot;). It may not be a horror film, but it is suspenseful enough to almost be that way (kinda like &quot;Seven&quot;).</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I've seen Ashton Kutcher before in Dude Where's My Car and Just Married, and he didn't do a thing for me. But add slightly longer, less dorky hair, and a beard, then my eyes literally go out on stalks in my head! Plus, a lovely scene for the ladeez - he appears in little more than a towel at one point, which is very low-slung, and all the females will be yelling at the screen to get him to drop it! That doesn't necessarily mean I like guys with beards - they're OK to look at, it's a totally different matter if you go to kiss them!<p>I've read the novelisation of this, and absolutely loved it. The film is absolutely terrific too, although I missed the first couple of minutes, due to not finding a parking space! All people seem to know Ashton Kutcher for is playing dorky roles/playing dorky roles/ditching Brittany Murphy for Bruce Willis' ex. Wow. What they don't realise is he can pretty much do a serious role, AND he exec-produced it too. Just a little thing to add his CV.<p>If you've read the book, you'll pretty much understand what happens when the film suddenly jumps forward 5 minutes or so. Unfortunately, I went with someone who hadn't read the book, and I kept getting elbows in my ribs every two seconds, asking what the hell was going on! All the 'missing' sections appear later in the movie, but I kinda knew what was happening. It takes a lot to have at least some intelligence.<p>Amy Smart (who I've mainly known from Rat Race) plays the role of Caillie brilliantly. Her image constantly changes throughout the film (think Jenny's sometimes drastic image changes in Forrest Gump). <p>If you're expecting the ending to be very predictable, you'd be wrong. I couldn't really remember what the ending was from the book (need to re-read it now!), and I was quite surprised. It's one of those "what if?" endings, totally not what you're expecting to happen.<p>If you get a chance to see this movie, GO SEE IT! You won't regret it. Or get the DVD. Whatever suits you. I'll be first in line to get the DVD. Already pre-ordered it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>The Butterfly Effect still confuses me to this day. The director's cut alternate ending is probably better than the original ending. Ashton Kutcher looks out of place in this role, and Amy Smart always pulls off a convincing performance. They have great chemistry together but the plot is a little far-fetched and contrived. This is one film you will either love or hate, for me it just gave me a headache.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RFG9LI7JDILS.html">A2RFG9LI7JDILS</a><br/><p>I am not at all a fan of Ashton Kutcher, and the idea of time travel is, well.. a cliche by now. But somehow 'butterfly effect' succeeds in grabbing its audience... I guess it is the whole idea of playing with reality, an idea profound yet simple.. I agree in part with the criticism of this movie - it is far from perfect - but it is well worth watching - and I don't enjoy most hollywood films.. not great but good.</p></br><a href="../users/AE4JNORCLW8F6.html">AE4JNORCLW8F6</a><br/><p>Because of the mixed reviews I had read, I didn't know what to expect before watching the movie. I was impressed from beginning to end. Though disturbing in several areas, the film kept my attention and engaged my mind. Ashton Kutcher gave an excellent performance, as did the other actors. The plot was unique, so this wasn't a run-of-the-mill psychological thriller. Character development was superb, making the storyline that much more engaging and important. I'm glad I ignored the bad reviews and checked it out for myself. It was worth the watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>If you like the off-the-wall movie, check this one out.  By off-the-wall, I mean anything from FIGHT CLUB or THE BEACH to DONNIE DARKO.<br /><br />Ashton Kutcher plays a young man who, after suffering childhood blackouts, discovers a way of stepping back into his past through self-hypnosis.  When he tries to help other kids and their traumas by changing his past, he wakes up in an altered present filled with radical, sometimes-horrible differences.<br /><br />Sounds complicated, but the movie's pretty easy to follow (just pay attention).<br /><br />The DVD comes with the Theatrical Version and the Director's Cut.  The endings are different but they both worked for me.<br /><br />Cool story.</p></br><a href="../users/AJ9W09EUQPAKE.html">AJ9W09EUQPAKE</a><br/><p>This is a fairly original movie that has several flaws but much to go for it as well. the story of Evan (Ashton Kutcher), a psychology student who discovers the ability to change events in the past, obscured by blackouts but revealed by reading his childhood journals is an entertaining, convincing plot with several interesting incarnations. Just as a butterfly flapping its wings in China is meant to set of a chain of results that leads to a hurricane in Florida, the movie explores the counterfactuals that can result from changing one event in history.<br /><br />Of course, this central premise (the dangers of changing history) is not original, but the movie is saved from cliche by several aspects. Firstly the ways in which the different characters are affected are complicated, varied, realistic and require some sharply changing acting. For example, the character of Tommy - warped from abuse by his paedophile father (played by Eric Stoltz) turns into, at various times, a psychopath and a born again Christian.<br /><br />The themes are disturbing and often taboo- e.g paedophilia and prostitution - it seems director Eric Bess wanted the movie to have a disturbing, frightening tone. Generally this works and the actors play their parts with sinister realism. This is helped by using different actors to play the main characters as children, teenagers and adults respectively. The best example is Jesse James playing the teenage Tommy with sadistic hatred. Stoltz is convincing as the twisted father and Andy Smart deals with the different situations Kayleigh, Evan's childhood friend whom he has a lifelong crush on, finds herself in with commendable chameleon skill. The main problem is Kutcher himself. He is not laughably awful as some critics described him. It is just that he frequently lapses into laughably over the top ham acting with a half silly expression on his face that threatens to drag the film into the realms of black comedy. Essentially, he is a goofy comic actor who makes a commendable but inadequate stab at a complex, serious role.<br /><br />I have other quibbles with the movie as well. The ending - a sort of disturbing antithesis to the message of 'It's a Wonderful Life' is pretty underwhelming and left me feeling that the central message of the film - that changing history has reckless consequences - had turned into a rather bleak and pointless message of the futility of Evan's entire life.<br /><br />But don't let this put you off. Many critics hated this film. It is true that minor details leave a lot to be desired. But the general tone is haunting, tense and packed with nervous energy and some good cinematography. The viewer constantly is on edge, wondering how the butterfly effect will take its next turn.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>The idea of 'The Butterfly Effects' sounds unique, but actually it is a more violent and unnerving version of Ray Bradbury's 'A Sound of Thunder' (which was filmed in 2003 with the director Peter Hyams, but of which release is much delayed).  For all its overwrought script, 'The Butterfly Effect' remains intriging all through, with the time paradox idea twisted and turned countless times.<br /><br />Ashton Kutcher (not so bad playing a serious role) is Evan, who as a little boy experiences sudden memory losses.  Whenever it happens, something terrible has happened around him, but the boy does not remember the truths while, as the film implies, the kids and adults surrounding him know, and greatly affected by, these horrible events.<br /><br />[IF YOU CAN CHANGE THE PAST...] Grown-up and in college, Evan is now a brilliant student majoring in psychology.  But one day he finds he has special ability to 'go back' to the certain point of the past, and 'see' the incidents that really happened to him.  Moreover, he realizes by interfering the events, he can change the entire course of the life of him and his girlfriend Kayleigh (excellent Amy Smart).  But the more Evan interfers, the more the history gets meddled, often with a very awful result.<br /><br />Avid film fans would promptly point out that the central idea is a familiar one -- remember the films like 'Frequency,' 'Somewhere in Time,' 'Retroactive,' and of course, the great 'Back to the Future' trilogy.  'The Butterfly Effect,' least humorous among them, uses this time-travel concept in a way those films never did before, including the disturbing elements like murders, abusing children, prostitution, hurting animal, and so on and on.  'Donnie Darko' surely contains pretty dismal moments, but compared with this, it is a real fun movie.<br /><br />The story of 'The Butterfly Effect' never stops, and by refusing to give us the chance to think a moment, it gives the audiences a non-stop roller-coaster ride, which changes the fate of Evan, Kaykeigh, and the others involved Evan's life in the most unpredictable fashion.  Though the ride is never boring, too many things are crammed in the script, and with less characters and incidents the film could have been better.<br /><br />Finally, as to Ashton Kutcher himself.  I think he did better acting than I expected, but still I could not shake off the image of him in 'Dude, Where's My Car?' and most notably, TV series 'Punk'd.'  I can understand the opinions of some reviewers saying he is unfairly treated -- I agree -- but if he really wants to be taken seriously, he should quit the hidden camera show immediately, or at least, before they start to make a sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>While I tried hard to like this, I found the acting so mediocre and the plot twists so outlandish, that I simply could not forget that this was a made-up thing and believe it for a time.  The actors all seem like amateurs - there is little chemistry between would-be lovers and friends, just lousy acting.<br /><br />ALso, it is not very good sci-fi:  I mean, like his dad this guy just has some kind of power to go back in time and change things by looking in his diary or at old photos (but not otherwise!).  Then, once he's back in the present, he can remember how things were, unlike anyone else who's affected.  While the ways that things change with his meddling is intriguing, it was too lacking in subtlty to seduce my imagination.  So I just couldn't believe any of it.<br /><br />Not recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XJOSJN6FHFO0.html">A1XJOSJN6FHFO0</a><br/><p>I sat and watched this movie with my family.  Evan is introduced to us, a young boy whose dad is in a mental hospital. Evan is a sad young man who deals with his problems and fears the only way his mind knows how, with blackouts.  His father experienced the same condiction.  We go through the movie seeing this happen to Evan from youth up to his young adult age where he is happy that he has no more.<br /><br />  Evan, like his dad kept a journel of his life.  In looking back upon this journey, Evan is able to return to those events, remember them and change them.  There is one problem however, the new outcome is not always better than the one before.<br /><br />  This was a different movie, disturbing at times with its content, but nevertheless quite good. We all have thought, if I could go back and change that event, I would.  But perhaps the final result of that would not be any better than what we are now experiencing.  Who can tell?  Interesting isn't it? A movie that is a little bit like a mind tingler and will leave you with a few things to think about.<br /><br />Shirley Johnson</p></br><a href="../users/AG0TA24LI0XV7.html">AG0TA24LI0XV7</a><br/><p>As I watch this film I just keep saying, "Oh, man, what horribly disturbing thing is going to happen next??"<br />If this thought thrills you, then give this flick five stars, by all means.<br /><br />I really don't know what to make of The Butterfly Effect except that its few interesting concepts (and they are very few) are completely drowned out by a deeply disturbing and manipulative series of events which are supposed to be a story.<br /><br />This is a nasty film. I don't say things like that often, and I don't use words lightly.<br /><br />This movie just smacks you in the face time after time with insulting nonsense. Throughout the entire film I feel extremely uncomfortable. And not in the good way that you enjoy from a film. Maybe that's what they were looking to do when they made this thing, make people uncomfortable. No, thanks. If someone finds this stuff fun or enjoyable, then there is a problem with the person emotionally or psychologically.<br /><br />Child pornography, drug abuse, cruelty to animals, and unspeakable graphic violence from kids are all things that lurk in our deepest nightmares (or on the six o'clock news broadcasts). But here they are, presented for your approval as entertainment. Not my idea of a good night at the movies.<br /><br />I would feel differently if this film really raised some worthwhile issues, or had a truly riveting story to tell, or contained fascinating and richly drawn characters, or painted an emotionally satisfying picture. It does none of these things.<br /><br />Each fantastic and twisted scenario presented gets worse and worse. This is really just an exercise in sensational shock value. 'How can we freak the audience out for a couple of hours', this film seems to ask. And even when the film seems to be going in a positive direction it is all too brief and too late for all the negative crap it has already spewed at its audience.<br /><br />People who love this film should reexamine why they do. It may be just for cheap and easy thrills. This movie flirts with science fiction and aims to be high psychological drama. It fails, big time. People say "Wow, this film really blew my mind". Fine. Yes, it's all very freaky and disturbing stuff. But does that equal a good film? No. There are other psychological films that succeed way beyond this junk, movies that are thought provoking, entertaining, and fascinating, that don't pander to the lowest or go for cheap jolts. I would advise people to avoid this movie unless they enjoy staring at awful car wrecks for long periods of time.<br /><br />The worst part for me is that this could have been a really fascinating and interesting film (rather than a stupid shock ride), because it plays with such intriguing concepts and ideas: time travel and altering the past to change the future. Handled differently, The Butterfly Effect could've been a good film instead of a huge, ugly disappointment.</p></br><a href="../users/A23L2BR07AOBG1.html">A23L2BR07AOBG1</a><br/><p>Why is the trailer excellent?  It decieves you into thinking that certain events happen out of order and at least that mislead has brought some attention to the film because otherwise this fish is dead in the water.  The biggest reason that I can point to the directing.  It's absolutely terrible.  I never had a sense of place within this film whether it was outside, inside, obviously on a set.  These places didn't feel like anything.  The film doesn't establish moods, or opinions about much of anything and that is the fault of the director. I didn't sense any kind of importance, or relevance to the events that happened within the first five minutes and within ten I was passively wishing this was over.  The editing was cold and mechanical when the only way that this would've worked would've been as a personal study (it doesn't the script, or brains to put off a competent sci fi, I'll get to that later).  Sound is the only thing the directors did partially well.  I say partially because when the actors couldn't keep attention on the screen the sound jumped out and got it, but after awhile it became revealed as a cheap trick to simply replace emotional development. What's worse is that in some scenes which are meant to be disturbing, they have surround sound of a crowd laughing and it's so loud that it actually sounds like the crowd in the theater is laughing at the film, just plain bad.  As for the acting, I think that the direction does the performances a disservice, but the casting director is just as much to blame for some obvious miscasts, or maybe they wouldn't be miscasts if the script gave them something interesting to say, or if it was plausible and the actors were being directed by good artists.  There are some whole within the plot and I'm sure that they're intentional.  1) If his father had this power to travel back in time than why is it that the blackouts that Kutcher's character indures within his life are only his own tamperings later in life. 2)If he simply goes back by concentrating on the events that happened in his journals which are actually his memories then why can't he go back by simply remembering?  3)what seven year old boy keeps a journal in today's day and age? 4)If he wrote all of these old journals for such a long time, why is it that he never reads them until after the blackouts stop? 5)If he can go back through time and change events, therefore changing history and his memories then it's not possible that he could save those memories of himself changing, or that they had been changed at all.  He might even forget about his ability to change things, otherwise, it doesn't make sense for his brain to be bleeding. 6)The quote at the beginning suggests that the butterfly effect can be catstrophic and because its effects are limited to the lives of only a few people and not the surroundings and/or entire world it really doesn't fulfill its potential. Ditto on the movie, but Kutcher was a passable actor in the main role. Also, the movie is an empty nuggett because it goes out of its way at the end to say that certain talents are better left unused, if that's the lesson then why waste my time showing them being used haphazardly and only having them work out at the end in service of the plot? On the plus side, I didn't hate it and just felt empty at the end, in a sedated way.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R.html">A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R</a><br/><p>I first saw BE on video rental, then I watched the director's cut, and the ending was very sad, when she was giving birth and he died. It made me cry. The movie is well acted but the story is very sad and disturbing. I DID NOT LIKE THE PART WHEN THE DOG WAS SET ON FIRE!!!! And whoever did has problems because that was horrible. There is alot of violence in the film, but what do you expect with a rated R version. Amy Smart is a very talented young actress and gives an unforgettable performance as the estranged girlfriend who was abused by her father. Both versions were sad, and both endings, but especially when he has to save everyone by wiping out his own existence by not being born, which the psychic said he was never meant to be alive, a still-born was suppose to be his fate. If you put all the tragedies together, it's a depressing story about fate, and how changing one thing can cause a rift of disaster. I think this is the first serious film Ashton Kutcher has done. I wish that it wasn't so sad and dark.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>Why do people in Hollywood try to take a 30 minute episode of the Twilight Zone and stretch it out to almost 2 hours??<br /><br />This movie is way too long.

Evan's mother becomes very concerned as she finds out that he has begun to display some bizarre traits in school and at home.  The mother is also concerned as Evan's father is institutionalized in a highly secure clinic and she is worried that Evan might begin to show the same traits as his father.  This leads the mother to contact a psychiatrist, who instructs Evan to begin to write a daily journal.<br /><br />Years later when Evan attends college as a psychology honors student he begins to have flashes of his past.  Evan returns to his childhood town to find out more about his past and he finds that his friends also suffer from the past traumatic events.  It troubles Evan that he and his friends endure deep emotional pain, which leads him to read his old journals in order to find a solution to the problems.  The reading opens Pandora's Box as he realizes that he can return to the past and change the future.<br /><br />Butterfly Effect has interesting premise, however, it falls short as it gives a serious attempt to depict two interesting philosophical notions.  The reasons for its shortcomings are the numerous plot holes and blunders in the story.  The film, at times, seems rushed and hurried as appropriate channels were not consulted before shooting several of the scenes.  This results in several awkward moments that are enhanced by the lead in the film.  Butterfly Effect begins extremely promising, but lands far from a great cinematic experience as the end credits roll.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>The Butterfly Effect (Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber, 2004)<br /><br />Bress and Gruber, the scriptwriters for Final Destination 2, deliver their directorial debut with one of the worst casting decisions of all time, Ashton Kutcher (That 70's Show) in a dramatic role.<br /><br />Or so it seemed.<br /><br />Kutcher is actually one of the best things about this movie. Like Jamie Foxx in Any Given Sunday, an actor who's nauseatingly annoying in comedies gets put into a drama and shows that he does, in fact, have talent.<br /><br />The first half of the film, which despite the above doesn't feature Kutcher, is told in flashback form as we meet the main character, Evan Treborn (played variously by Kutcher, Unbreakable bit player John Patrick Amadori, and Logan Lerman of The Patriot, Riding in Cars with Boys, etc.) at three separate times in his life. He's your typical unpopular schoolkid with a very small group of friends, a similarly messed up brother and sister, Tommy (William Lee Scott/Jesse James/Cameron Bright) and Kaylee (Amy Smart/Irene Gorovaia/Sarah Widdows) Martin, and the fat kid, Lenny (Eldon Hensen/Kevin Schmidt/Jake Karese). Evan suffers from odd blackouts throughout his life, and also various other things, like the Martins' dad (played menacingly by the always-fun Eric Stoltz) being an abusive pedophile, and his own father (Callum Keith Rennie, recently in Torso, eXistenZ, and Memento) being locked up in a mental institution for suffering from the same thing Evan does.<br /><br />Let me make sure you understand this: the setup is fantastic. Everything is laid out perfectly for the massive payoff. Sure, a few things are a little too pat (Martin, for example, is stereotyped to the point of silliness), and it's obvious that they're setting you up for the massive payoff. But that makes it no less enjoyable.<br /><br />The movie, however, starts to go downhill when it snaps back to the present. It goes from being a good thriller to something of an episode of Quantum Leap. To be short, the payoff is simply not as good as the buildup was; it's as if they had this idea, worked out how to get to it, then got there and realized there was no creative energy left.<br /><br />Maybe I'm being a bit too harsh. Some parts of the present-day storyline work just fine. They don't leave any loose ends around. Things are still a little too pat (the stereotyping of Evan's mother during one scene is so stupid it makes Eric Stoltz's character look like something out of Sartre), especially when you get to the ending (which takes the message of a popular classic film-- to say which one would give it away-- and turns it on its head), which is way too "man, that's the way things SHOULD have happened" to be anything but a cheap trick. And the idea itself is extremely interesting, and could be done far better, were anyone to come up with a good way to do it (it's been done in novels and in short form, but I don't think a feature film has ever quite pulled it off).<br /><br />All in all, some good things, some bad things. Probably worth a rental just to marvel at the idea Ashton Kutcher really can act. Lord knows we've never seen him do it before. ** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A2X6GEC6LCDN4S.html">A2X6GEC6LCDN4S</a><br/><p>Character development was not very good.  I found myself not especially liking or having a reason to like any of the characters in the movie. They seemed all so shallow and self-centered.  The movie jumps back and forth so much it seems like the people who made the movie may have been on drugs of some kind.  Creative idea for a movie, but what does the magic in the movie have to do with Chaos Theory?  This should be more thoroughly explained, right??<p>Kutcher is a great &quot;bad boy&quot; actor..that is about the only talent in the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>I was so excited to see this movie, and it was good and mysterious until you figured out what was happening. It then got a little tedious. Kutcher can't act, which doesnt help the movie. Many better movies to tweak the brain.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GANR9I6XHTU9.html">A2GANR9I6XHTU9</a><br/><p>Im reading reviews here that say the critics didnt like this film cause it had Ashton Kutcher in it or this n that. They didnt like this film cause it was bad, Truly BAD. I read the rave reviews on this site and purchased it full price thinking it was going to be good so Id take a chance. What a mistake. A bunch of convuluted mixed up crap. Starring Ashton Kutcher who I think should stick to TV and shows like ( That 70s show ) instead of trying to be a film actor because he just dosent cut it. Hes better at comedy. He dosent give a good performance as a serious actor nor did i buy it. Amy Smart was mediocre in this role. The whole film was mediocre at best, barely watchable. Long tedious and boring. Ashton Kutcher stars as a college kid who keeps revisiting his past and going back in time through a notebook he kept when he was younger. The movie is basically about what would happen if he did somthing diffrent in his past and what would happen if he could change it and the situations it would lead to and how it would affect peoples lives. No matter how he changes it the outcome always seems to be bad. Him and his mother encounter a fortune teller during the movie that says something to the extent of you were never meant to be born or you dont have a soul. It all comes together at the end of the film. During all this nonsense he keeps re reading his notebook and starts to go into a transe and his nose starts bleeding. Very lame. I cant even get into all the details of this film- to mixed up to describe. I would recomend you rent this first before purchasing then decide. See if you can take it or even sit through it. 2.5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>He can go back in time and change events, which changes the lives of his circle of friends, and family.  Not very profound . . . obviously, changing the past will change the future.  But for the Butterfly Effect to be true to its name, many other things would change too, which doesn't happen.  The film is "politically correct" covering a rainbow of situations . . . in having lead characters in prison, dead, happily married, as a paraplegic, as students, in a mental ward, with incurable cancer, in a porno movie, a drug-crazed hooker, and so on.  What's left out?  This is a simple minded film which makes very little sense and it would be better to have passed it by.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>I had seen and read previews for THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT and was really intrigued. I thought the movie would offer something along the lines of the famous Ray Bradbury story. Boy, was I ever wrong.<p>The movie is, well it's just a movie. But it's the first time in a long time that I actually considered walking out of the theatre.  The convoluted plot begins near the end of the film, then flashbacks thirteen years before in time. Ashton Kutcher's character is a child who starts suffering from blackouts and has brain bleeding, similar to his father (who lives in a mental institution). Kutcher's character soon learns that he can travel back through time by reading journals from his youth. He has to concentrate on what he is doing and he is only able to travel back in his own life and control his former self. That doesn't really make any sense and the movie doesn't either. I guess the best way to describe it is a cross between SOMEWHERE IN TIME and BEING JOHN MALKOVICH.<p>The movie doesn't really make any sense. I heard several people say near the end of the film, "I have no idea what is going on." Also, the film is such a bizarre blend, that it just left the audience confused. For instance, there were several times in the movie that were clearly meant to be serious, but not in a shocking way:  several people were laughing and several people were gasping in shock. Of course, besides all the confusion, there's also the fact that the film doesn't remain true to logic.  For instance, Kutcher's character goes back in time to the exact same period of his childhood at least two times. His character performs different actions all three times, which makes no sense whatsoever.  As for the "big questions" this movie supposedly raises, it really doesn't ask any. It just appears that it does, kind of like a political candidate appearing to answer a question without really answering it.<p>Just trying to write about the movie is confusing and is gives me a headache. I would recommend staying away from this film at all costs because it really is a waste of your time (the only things worthwhile in the film are Kutcher and Amy Smart and the eerie musical score). However, if you do see it, be forewarned--you won't be able to travel back and repair your "mistake".</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>What did I just watch? A sci-fi thriller? A modern "horror" tale, as advertised? Or was this a semi-serious attempt at that "Simpsons" episode in which Homer creates a time machine out of a toaster and keeps altering his universe? Guess it doesn't really matter because whatever it was, it was fairly perplexing. <p>First, the central quasi-timetravel theme is so dense and doozy that it hogs about 1/3rd of the movie just to present itself. We are led to believe that an adolosecent possesses the mystic ability to get back into his childhood memory and restitch some key components that were too painful for him. <p>Fine and dandy, but the screenplay with which this is told is messy and unriveting. There are scenes of ragging (bullying, hazing) that just add very little to the overall texture of the movie. There's also a scene with Kutcher waking up in the buff with no memory of the girl in his bed last night, which is followed by a walk to the communal showers from where hot women with no clothing emerge. Sounded more like like a showcase rather than an important bit of script. <p>Third, the metaphysics are just plain questionable. How come Evan's personal diaries and notes remain unaffected when the rest of his world is warped into intended "Life, version 2.0"? Looks like we make up our own rules as we go along the film, which makes the minor sting of the "ultimate sacrifice" as numb and vague as the rest of the humorless ordeal.<p>Overall, perhaps a worthy ride if you're into insanely "different" themes but it's hard to care about this stuff and the actors in it.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>Ashton Kutcher (A Lot Like Love, Guess Who) stars in this totally dull and empty thriller/drama about a boy who suffered from blackouts during his childhood and wrote when he did, he wrote them down in his journal. He left his hometown and now he's in college, that's Kutcher, and when Kutcher reads the journals of his past he is instantly transported back into child form so he can prevent bad things, examples are death of a mom and  her baby, falling in love with his friends sister who's dad, played by Eric Stoltz (Kicking and Screaming, Out Of Order) is a pedophile and video tapes. He soon changes it, but is this really the place he wanted to go as he tries to change it several more times, each with different outcomes and consequences. Also starring Amy Smart (Road Trip, Varsity Blues), William Lee Scott (Identity, October Sky), Elden Henson (Idle Hands, The Mighty), Ethan Suplee (Mallrats, Evolution) and Melora Walters (Magnolia, Desert Saints). Kutcher is not even close to being convincing in his role where he tries to show us another side of his acting but come on.....who really cares? A good supportive cast is wasted. Not much to look at...though it is an interesting premise but we coulf of had someone else besides Kutcher....litereally</p></br><a href="../users/A3M5O6UHXO9IBU.html">A3M5O6UHXO9IBU</a><br/><p>Boasting a similar plot to "Bedazzled", in which Dudley Moore, granted seven wishes by the devil, finds himself tied in ever more fiendish knots as he tries to get closer to the girl of his dreams. He is finally trapped as a nun blowing a perenial rasberry in his own private hell. You may find yourself wanting to blow a similar rasberry in the direction of "Butterfly Effect", a far less entertaining film.<br /><br />Likewise, it is about the hopeless pursuit of a paramour, only the title is a misnomer, being nothing to do with chaos theory. Instead, it is, like "Bedazzled", decidedly non-secular and old-testament in its morality. It is just beyond the balance of probabilities that every outcome would be negative. Thus the cards are stacked in favour of a reactionary message of not defying God's will, rather than the capriciousness of nature, in which they would not. The Christian theme of sacrificing oneself for others in an act of faith and love might be aimed squarely at the bible belt, had it not been for the perverse solution of an abortion which would more likely have fundamentalists frothing at the mouth. Definately one for the "what were they thinking of?" filing cabinet.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>I've never seen Fitzcarroldo, one of many Werner Herzog masterpieces, but this is the story of all the difficulties he faced in filming it. This film was filmed by Les Blank, not Werner Herzog. Burden of Dreams is positively fascinating, and Werner Herzog is a compelling presence who you simply must love. He filmed Fitzcarroldo in the Amazon jungle for over five years, and the story of how he did it is gripping. Bonus material involves him eating his shoes, looking back at all this 20 years later, and some other cool stuff. Get this one.

I didn't hear or read any criticism, so I went into the movie with an open mind and lots of hope that this would be a movie that I would enjoy.  I was very wrong.  I was disturbed by parts (and I've seen some very disturbing movies, but this was just too much for me) and I was also bored halfway through the film.  I saw about half and didn't watch the other half.  I also couldn't stand all the switching screens all the time, I was losing my train of thought as to what was actually happening.  I love 'psychological thrillers' as I would call this movie, but this..this was just not what I expected.  At all.  It almost makes me wonder if everyone was watching the same movie as I was.  But I guess they were.  Maybe you'll have to see it for yourself, but for me, I'll pass.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I thought the movie was great psychological thriller, involving a pretty typical storyline about alterations to the past causing the future to turn out in "unexpected ways"... rarely ever the way the protagonist really wants it to be. This is one of those movies that will keep your full attention for the entire length. Ashton Kutcher, in his first serious role, plays surprisingly well in this movie. He shows us a side that I hope we'll see again. But for the kind of person he is, Kutcher does an excellent job portraying his character. Amy Smart, William Lee Scott, and Elden Henson all have done a great job on acting out on different levels of their characters with the same core in each variation.<br /><br />Who ever wrote this was a smart person. There needs to be more intelligent writers. It is a big responsibility to entertain our public. A movie such as this makes us think about "what if" affects us emotionally, yet changes our physical world, thus putting great responsibility on the writer. This writer did very well and I thank him. We could use more thought feed movies in our world today. Imagine no war and always peace. Would our Bush agree to war, and What would happen if we all could go back to September 11th. Too many people focus on personal gain. Would it not benefit us all in a personal way to have peace? One act of kindness can be felt around the world. One violent thought not acted upon can cause a positive movement, just like that of a butterfly. The tension builds up quickly and you're never quite given a chance to relax before the end. I like that in a movie...it keeps you on your toes.<br /><br />This movie is very well done and well structured. There are no low points in this movie - each scene has a point and ties directly into the main idea of the movie. The ending is great as it made me feel sad but happy of its outcome. I'm glad that this movie was brought to my attention because its simply fantastic. I'll definitely watch this again just in case I missed anything. Recommend to those who haven't seen it yet.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>I thouroughly enjoyed The Butterfly Effect from start to finish. It's not a fun film to watch, in fact, it's very tragic and depressing, but it's also engrossing, well-made, and exceptionally acted. Ashton Kutcher shows that not only can he pull off some funny pranks, but he can support a dramatic film as well. Melora Walters, with her meak voice and undeniable maternal presence, was the perfect choice to play his mother. Amy Smart, beautiful and innocent, was wonderful as Ashton's sometimes girlfriend. She had the most difficult job because she gets to change personalities so quickly, and she pulled it off very well.<br /><br />The film was brutal, way too honest, and at times, very tough to take, but I loved how it didn't shy away from the tragedies in life like most movies do. This is a terrific film, one of the best of the year in my opinion, that manages to leave a mark and lingers in the mind long afterward. It does try to tackle way too much in too short a period, but it manages to crawl under the skin and refuses to come out. After a string of very disappointing Hollywood thrillers, The Butterfly Effect was a very refreshing change of pace; a Hollywood thriller that actually thrills. The theatrical trailer, included on the DVD, did not do it justice.<br /><br />Note: While some viewers prefer the Direcor's Cut of the film, I was surprised because I think the Theatrical Version is a much better film. More tightly paced and with a far superior ending, the Theatrical Version is the definitive one to watch. Out of curiosity though, pop in the Director's Cut on the flip side and watch the final 5 minutes to see the main difference between both versions. While both are emotional, the Theatrical Version has a better ending that is more suitable to the film. Both versions are GREAT, but surprisingly, I prefer the original theatrical one since usually, the Direcor's Cut fairs better.<br /><br />I recommend this film. I absolutely loved it!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>If you were a fan of the Twilight Zone (you know, the old black & white TV series) you should love The Butterfly Effect.

I remember the Ray Bradbury short story where the guy goes back in time to shoot a T-Rex and changes the future because he comes back with a butterfly on his boot and enjoyed watching Sam trying to set the past to rights on "Quantum Leap." But the story from co-writers and co-directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber also resonates with me because of an idea I had for short story about a rich guy who wants the Confederacy to win the Civil War. He sits in the time machine trying to select the right moment to go back and change history; he only has one shot and he sits there, going over all the options (e.g., assassinate Lincoln years earlier, help Pickett's charge succeed), unable to decide which would guarantee success.<br /><br />However, in "The Butterfly Effect" it turns out that Evan (Ashton Kutcher) has multiple opportunities for changing his past, although actally it is the past of Kayleigh Miller (Amy Smart) that he wants to change. But his also means changing the past of Kayleigh's brother, Tommy (William Lee Scott) and their friend, Lenny (Elden Henson), as well as Evan's mother (Melora Walters) and his college roommate (Ethan Suplee). The problem is that every time he changes the past things do not necessarily get better as new problems are presented. But Evan keeps trying to find the magic solution that will set everything to rights, or at least what he thinks would be the best of all possible worlds.<br /><br />Evan and his friends had a trouble childhood. "The Butterfly Effect" takes place mainly in the present, but it also involves going back to when the kids were 7 and discovered that Mr. Miller (Eric Stolz) was a sicko and when they were 13 and something equally horrible happened. The first time we visit these events we do not know everything that happened because Evan does not remember; as a child he was afflicted with blackouts and since the film is told from his perspective we follow suit. Evan's mother is worried that he might have the same mental illness as his father, but Dr. Redfield (Nathaniel DeVaux) does not think so and has Evan start keeping a journal.<br /><br />In college Evan discovers that when he reads the journal entries he wrote in the past he can go back to that moment in time and that he can control what he says and does, thereby changing the present. This is certainly an interesting way of engaging in time travel (cf. Christopher Reeves thinks his way to the past in "Somewhere in Time") and I think "The Butterfly Effect" is a rather ambitious time travel film that is trying to be intelligent in terms of both the theory at work and the construction of the story. This is one of those films where you can better appreciate it the second time around, even if you do all the Infinifilm options, especially once you understand the rules for the game.<br /><br />In the end I am not sure if it is because the intelligence of the story by Bress and Gruber is not up to their ambition, but you cannot fault the effort. One of the strengths of this film is how it takes it time, as Evan wrestles with not only the changes in his world but struggles to figure out what he can do to make everything better the next time around. This is certainly superior to their previous effort, "Final Destination 2" and it will be interesting to see what they come up with next if they continue along this path. As for performances I would say that Amy Smart's is the best of the bunch and as for Ashton Kutcher, I know he is usually regarded as a tabloid joke or a television pretty boy, but this was actually the first film I have seen when I liked his character or his performance. He might be a forgotten actor by the end of the decade, but he gets props for showing some ambition. But in the final analysis this is Bress and Gruber's film and everybody is just along for the ride.<br /><br />I watched the director's cut (or, I guess, the directors' cut) before seeing the original theatrical ending or the two alternative endings ("Stalker" and "Happy Sappy") and at this point would have to say the first one I saw is the best of the bunch. That is because while the effect remains the same the cause in the original theatrical release is just too simplistic after the complicated setup. Granted, the preferred version is rather dark and twisted, but if you listen to any of the commentary on the DVD you will understand their reasoning.</p></br><a href="../users/A5UMUVEV1RUS9.html">A5UMUVEV1RUS9</a><br/><p>In the last decade, I've grown weary of going to the theater to see new movies. There is always some jerk talking on their phone, or children that are inappropriately aged for the material crying or complaining the entire time. Instead, I enjoy watching movies at home. But as with any DVD addict, you're always looking for something else. Something new to watch. That's how I found The Butterfly Effect.<br /><br />After several of my friends swore by it, I just went ahead and bought it, and am I glad I did because this will be one movie I'll watch 1,000 times over. I was completely riveted. What I loved most was that with every time he tried to change the outcome, the characters interacted differently. Ashton's goth roommate was his friend once, and then when he goes and changes his past, it's as though they were never friends. I really enjoyed that each actor had the chance to play a different version of their characters. This is an incredible and very well done movie you won't regret watching at least once, but I suspect you'll want to watch it again and again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XX5797TIZT5Q.html">A1XX5797TIZT5Q</a><br/><p>Critics of this movie have a point -- this story writes its own rules of logic and cause and effect.  If you don't accept its premise, then you will probably ridicule every twist and turn in the story.<br /><br />I accepted the premise, though, and though not all the pieces work, the resultant story was so unpredictable and unusual that I found myself quite engrossed.  I was in fact surprised that this film was directed by the writers of Final Destination 2, which I disliked.  But this time, I found myself drawn into this world of parallel realities and possibilities drawn up by directors/writers Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber.  Where Final Destination 2 was all shock tactics and gratuitous gore set pieces, The Butterfly Effect does its job much more by playing with your expectations and sympathies.<br /><br />The performances are fine, with Ashton Kutcher doing a good job playing college psych major Evan, whose memory blanks out at key points in his life, leaving black holes he must fill in for himself.  The character is basically a god-like figure with the ability to change the realities of everybody around him by manipulating his own decisions.  This alone makes for a fascinating character motivation -- not quite complete altruism, but a mad dash to save the people he loves.  Melora Walters, Elden Henson and William Lee Scott tackle multiple roles with good results, and central figure Amy Smart has never looked dreamier, giving a solid emotional motivation for Evan's character.  The switching of roles and characters is an oft-used TV device, but it's done with enough aplomb and variety here to make the exercise highly entertaining.<br /><br />If I have one grudge, it's the pacing.  The first act of the film lurches forward jarringly (though not without reason), and scenes are often a little too short.  As a result, it's a little hard to accept when the central conceit first happens; it's like we were set up for a psychological thriller and then the filmmakers cheated us into a supernatural solution.  Still, it was somewhat fun to be completely disoriented by the "what the blazes?" middle of the film, and after the initial lurches, the narrative moves forward quite nicely.<br /><br />Say what you will about this film, but you can't say it doesn't take risks.  And the script is smart enough to ground its very far-fetched premise with enough setups, payoffs, catharsis and danger that even if you don't buy the conceit, you probably won't be bored.  Me, I enjoyed this film greatly and would recommend it highly.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>This film is an excellent spin on a fascinating and well-trodden concept. If one scans their memory, it has been done many times before in numerous ways. There was that familiar Simpson's episode where old Homer, in his usual fashion, accidentally creates a time machine in an effort to fix the family toaster, merely stepping on a flower or insect in the distant past, thereby altering the very fabric of future society. There was also Richard Bach's much-underrated 80's novel, "One", describing his and his wife Leslie's travels through alternate realities and dimensions. This was a good novel. The basic premise for all these stories are essentially the same, and that is, the choices we make in life, however small or mundane, can have a tremendous effect on our future circumstances.<br /><br />The Butterfly Effect is a moral tale and a love story. Similar to H.G. Wells' The Time Machine, traveling back in time to prevent the death of a loved one or the destiny of a loved one will not always turn out the way we want it to. The moral message in the film, I believe, is that we are ultimately responsible for our own condition, and the choices we make in life determine our destinies. But what if we could travel back in time and change our choices? And by making different choices, how profoundly would it affect the outcome of our lives? This concept also begs the question - is our future pre-determined?<br /><br />Ashton Kutcher delivers a good performance as the reluctant and later, obsessive traveler of alternate time. This film showed me that Kutcher has talent as an actor and could well go far in the profession. The two younger versions of his character also put in excellent performances, particularly the younger one of the two. It was also a pleasure to see Eric Stoltz again, as the character showed me that Stolz could just about play anything with believability.<br /><br />This film certainly cranks along and remains compelling to the end. And the film's ending, really, could have gone in many directions. The conclusion the writer's chose, however, was appropriate, as it rounded out this chaotic and at times complex tale, leaving the audience with a sense of closure. All in all, an entertaining film, with the added value of something to think about.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>A very interesting thriller that explores many of the same themes as the recent remake of &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, in &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; Ashton Kutcher finds that he has the ability to travel back in time by essentially reliving his memories based on his journals. The problem is that whenever he makes any changes, there are always disasterous and unpredictable consequences of his alteration of the past (hence the relationship to &quot;chaos theory&quot; and the term &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot;, i.e., a butterfly taking flight can have a dynamic effect on weather conditions making complete prediction impossible). <p>The film's dark vision doesn't make this light entertainment. Still, it's a very interesting and well made film that challenges the viewer's preconceptions. The kids cast in the film give strong, convincing performances. Ashton Kutcher does a solid job in his role as Evan &quot;the time traveler&quot; but he doesn't always have the dramatic depth to communicate everything he could. Still, he does an exceptional job with the skills he has to work with. He's proven that he can carry more than a comedy picture.  Amy Smart, in particularly, plays a variation on the same character many, many times with major differences depending upon how the timeline was altered. <p>I personally preferred the original theatrical ending. Why? Because creating hope out of hopelessness is an essential part of our humanity. The nilistic director's cut doesn't add anything and makes the character's sense of discovery worthless if there's no dramatic payoff that the audience can buy into. <p>The infinifilm features on the DVD allow you to watch short commentaries,a breakdown of visual effects, alternate takes,storyboards, deleted scenes with and without commentary then return immediately to the film. While it doesn't provide as much depth as a series of featurettes (or director's commentaries), it provides a thumbnail sketch of how the film took shape. <p>I'd be curious to hear the writers/directors take on the original ending vs. the theatrical cut. I won't say anything about the two except that one is more hopeful while the other is very, very dark. The latter ending made the film less pleasant for me. Sometimes the audience is right about the film and the artist wrong. In this case, I'd have to argue for watching the theatrical cut first and using the infinifilm feature to view the alternate, original ending of the film. It's the best way to gage them and compare them. <p>The DVD picture quality is pretty good overall on this dual sided single layer disc. The sound quality was a bit problematic at times as the version I purchased had some problems with distortion (which has become more and more of a problem with DVDs now that more of them are being pressed). My only complaint (a minor one at that) is that there isn't a director's commentary track. <p>&quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; isn't a perfect thriller but it doesn't need to be; the questions it raises and the genuine suspense created by not knowing the outcome of each change in the past makes it an enjoyable film to watch. Yes, there's a lot of dark stuff that happens shaping the events in the lives of these kids but it that is the essence good drama.</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>Ever since I first saw previews for this film, I was excited about it. Anytime the subject of time travel is approached, it usually makes for an interesting and exciting film. However, the film did have the critics going against it, and Ashton Kutcher trying to play in a dramatic role. <p>I finally got to see the movie recently, and I was pleasantly surprised at how good this film turned out to be. While it is not the best time travel film I have ever seen, it was extremely entertaining and suspenseful to see all the different lifetimes being played out. I really enjoyed the fact that Kutcher's character used his mind to travel in time and not a machine. The movie can be frustrating at times. In fact, after the first 20 minutes of the film I had serious doubts. Things would happen, followed by Ashton's Kutcher's character having a blackout right at the moment when an explanation was needed. This left myself and the rest of the audience feeling confused at what was playing out. But after the film gets over the initial speed bump in the beginning, The Butterfly Effect turns into a riveting thriller and everything is explained in the long run. The entire cast did a fantastic job in my opinion. While I still feel that Ashton Kutcher is not a very good actor, he did a lot better than I thought he would. Especially, when you consider the fact that he is known for being a comedy actor.<p>One of the best things about this film was the ending. It was not your typical happy ending. While every character's life turned out for the better, Kutcher's character still experiences loss and regret by how the story turns out. I was very happy with the ending, because it actually manages to leave your emotions feeling conflicted, which gets you thinking about how things could have been. Anytime you leave the theater in discussion about what you would have done differently, it means that the film made an impression on you. That is definately something that The Butterfly Effect manages to do.<p>I really don't understand the harsh treatment from critics. In Entertainment Weekly, the average grade for this film is a "C-". While The Butterfly Effect does have its flaws, it turned out to be a riveting thriller, with an original take on timetravel and an unpredictable ending.<p>A solid 4 out of 5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>This was a better than average, pleasent surprise when I saw it in theaters, and was descent when I saw it again.  Aston Kutcher plays a kid who has had several bumps in the road over the years, but discovers a special "gift" while studying late at night.  He findsa that he is able to travel back to times of high emotions in his life where he can have a chance to alter the course that his life takes.  Soon he discovers there is more behind this gift that what he could ever imagine.<br />This is a reasonable film that was just fun to watch, and the dvd has a lot of extras, including an alternate ending that I am very glad the hollywood producers did not make the original ending.  Check this out, chances are you will be surprised too.</p></br></body></html>

The plot aside, it never got past the point of disbelief for me:  while watching it, I constantly felt that someone was just making it up.  It simply did not sweep me into the narrative and get me to forget real life for a minute, it never scared me.  Nonetheless, the images are vivid, the actors are good, etc.  There just wasn't anything about it that struck me as original or worth the price.  Recommended tepidly.</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>John Carpentar created many memorable horror films in the late 70's and 80's. Ive noticed though his music in those films always seems to be the same but in a different key but I digress.<br /><br />The Fog has a unique story, a great atmosphere, and just falls short of great. This film feels rushed as the film barely clocks in at an hour and half. The story barely takes off and its over. I still enjoyed it and it's better then more then 85% of horror movies released today.</p></br><a href="../users/A15YPJLKLZS0MK.html">A15YPJLKLZS0MK</a><br/><p>100 years ago a ship wrecked under fog. The dead mariners return from the grave for revenge. A priest saves(?) them at the end. A pretty good rental flick, and the best horror film I've seen in awhile. I would recommend it to see once or twice, and for those curious as to John Carpenter's non- Halloween work as a film maker, this is a fine film, but not the all time classic Halloween is.</p></br><a href="../users/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ.html">A22BPC7LRSGSYQ</a><br/><p>John Carpenter's The Fog (1979) is a typical John Carpenter movie.  Carpenter's horror movies are very simple.  Nothing complex.  This simple approach to horror really works well.  His three Halloween movies fall into this category as well (Halloween, Halloween II, and Halloween III).  The Fog, however, is pretty unique.  I think the setting of the movie is its greatest asset.  This movie takes place in the seaside village of Antonio Bay, California.  The basic story is that on the night of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the town, a thick fog emerges from the bay area and comes ashore.  But what also comes ashore in the fog are the ghosts of murdered sailors who want to get revenge for the sins of the town's founding fathers a century earlier.  Time is of the essence, for the town's people must solve a crime that's a century old, or die.  As the fog rolls in, the ghosts do too, and the eerieness level increases.<br /><br />This movie stars Adrienne Barbeau (John Carpenter's wife at the time) as the lighthouse disc jockey, Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween, Halloween II, Halloween H2O, etc.), Janet Leigh (Curtis's real life mother, and the star of Psycho), John Houseman, Hal Holbrook, Charles Cyphers (Halloween, Halloween II), and Tom Atkins (Halloween III).  The acting is good throughout.  John Carpenter himself even appears in the movie very briefly near the beginning.  In my opinion the strongest acting performance was by Adrienne Barbeau.  She has a good disc jockey voice and her on-air demeanor during the fog crisis is a strong point of the movie.<br /><br />This DVD comes with special features, two of which are called "Tales From The Mist - Inside 'The Fog' Documentary" and "Fear On Film - Inside 'The Fog' Documentary".  There are also outtakes, an advertising gallery, a storyboard-to-film comparison, and interesting audio commentary by John Carpenter and Debra Hill.<br /><br />If you want to watch a very good horror movie that is vintage John Carpenter, then The Fog is your movie.  I highly recommend it.  It's a good movie to watch late on Halloween night after the trick-or-treaters have gone home and the jack-o-lantern has been extinguished.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VJ80PM1G00QV.html">A2VJ80PM1G00QV</a><br/><p>I have a feeling I saw this when it came to TV sometime after release in 1980. I do remember ghosts and a fog; that's  about all. Picked it up at minimum price as I was on the check-out line at Borders today. Just one of those evenings when a ghost story seemed in order. Perhaps it was because yesterday, as I glanced over to a point about a half mile from where I stood, the tall buildings had their upper stories cloaked in, yes, truly, fog. Somewhat to  my surprise, as the first movie I have seen in a few months, it kept my attention until the final stages; always the toughest part to script in a film of this sort. Inevitably, there was a bit of a let-down for me,  though, obviously. not for many other viewers. All in all, I can recommend it for those who go for this kind of thing as a decent outing with little of the kind of cheap shot violence that takes the place of writing/directing skill.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCC5MAJYJYMD.html">A3MCC5MAJYJYMD</a><br/><p>'The Fog' is a decent horror movie from the talented director John Carpenter.  He was the guy who created the original 'Halloween' movie and the remake of 'The Thing'. The story is about a mysterious fog that envelopes a small town.  The fog contains a haunted ship.  The ghosts of the ship are wanting revenge from an incident that happened one hundred years earlier.  As with many horror movies, one has to suspend various logical flaws and unlikely coincidences.  But the movie is driven my the suspense and an eerie atmosphere.  The most memorable character is the female disc jockey who attempts to warn the town of the fog.  The movie has a cool ending also.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I am a big 70's and 80's John Carpenter fan and The Fog is probably my third favorite film of his. The horror master blends atmosphere, music and chills like no one else. Halloween and The Thing are constantly fighting for first place, but this hair-raising ghost tale is close behind those two. The setting (isolated fishing town), creepy story, one of my favorite musical scores and some revenge seeking ghost pirates makes The Fog a movie worthy of much more praise than most people seem to remember. I try to watch it at least once a year around Halloween time. It just gets me in the mood for my favorite holiday. Too bad John Carpenter hasn't made a decent movie in decades, but the three I mentioned in my review are horror flicks I admire everytime I watch them. They don't make them like this anymore.</p></br><a href="../users/AVQJD41PLPOOQ.html">AVQJD41PLPOOQ</a><br/><p>This classic horror film by John Carpenter speaks for itself in terms of atmospheric spookiness.  There aren't too many scary movies that take place in a coastal environment.<br /><br />I have a seasonal beach house that I keep open through October.  As Halloween gets closer each year, I love to watch this movie at my house with the lights turned out, knowing the beach, the ocean and maybe...the fog are right outside my door!<br /><br />Ooooooooh!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>"Scary then and still scary now." That's what a lot of people say about this movie, and I have no argument against that. I'm not particularly a fan of "ghost stories" but this is well done and still looks good, which is why they keep coming out with DVDs on this film and a recent re-make. It's a classic.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the re-make didn't have the cast this film had. Ladies go first in this "original" with Adrienne Barbeau in the lead as "Stevie Wayne," a small- town disc-jockey whose studio is a lighthouse. "Wayne" has a sexy voice that complements the story and adds a nice touch to it. Then there's the real life mother-daughter duo of Janet Leigh and Jamie Lee Curtis. The male lead is played by someone I am not familiar with, Charles Cyphers, but he does a fine job. John Houseman gets good billing here but he's only in the film the first three minutes!<br /><br />The "star" of this film, however, is the silvery, luminescent fog....a special-effect that was eerie 25 years ago and still has that effect. The films only lasts 90 minutes to the story zips by, the violence is effective but not overdone and the suspense is terrific.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>I originally saw "The Fog" in the theater, and remember being frightened in multiple places. John Carpenter managed to make a low budget picture scary using minimum special effects and a whole lot of fog. While fog has been used in other movies (I remember the attack of the werewolf in "Silver Bullet," where the werewolf attacked from the fog around his pursuers' feet), it was pervasive and thick, and the attacks came suddenly from the dense fog and yet the fog cleared enough to let you see the action.<br /><br />Antonio Bay is a small seaside town with a past. The past includes allowing a group of sailors to die on their ship. We know that this is a horror movie, and the dead rarely rest easy in their graves, particularly watery graves. When an eerie dense fog rolls over a ship, and there are thumps and bumps and suddenly the ship is unmanned, we know there is something wrong with the fog.<br /><br />We can also guess the fog will not stay out to see. As the intensity in the movie builds we see the fog roll in and the fog roll out, accompanying a great cast. John Houseman is spooky beach narrator Mr. Machen, sending chills through his audience as easily as he did his classes in "The Paper Chase." Janet Leigh is a town mover and shaker Kathy Williams and her indignation quickly changes to fear as she realizes the fog is outside her control and her experience. Jamie Lee Curtis is free spirit Elizabeth Solley, who seems to be a hands breadth from disaster for most of the movie. Hal Holbrook is Father Malone, a priest with psychological issues who feels like a martyr, intended or otherwise, from the time we first meet him. Tom Atkins plays Nick Castle, who fortunately takes into stride that evil ghosts are wandering around town with bad intent. Even John Carpenter makes an appearance.<br /><br />With all this talent, what more can you ask? How about Adrienne Barbeau as sultry Stevie Wayne, the voice of the local radio station who manages to put movie-goers into the right frame of mind as the fog rolls over the town and Stevie becomes an inadvertent Cassandra, heard only by those of us watching the movie. Ultimately I was clinging to the edge of my seat as Stevie Wayne tried to stay one step ahead of the fog and its evil.<br /><br />John Carpenter made "The Fog" in the style of horror movies of old. The movie relies on what you can barely see and the ever-present fog to build atmosphere rather than splattering blood and organs. The tension as the fog rolls into town and the bizarre events unroll builds until you think something has to happen, and John Carpenter keeps you guessing as to if and when throughout. Perhaps the best tension of all is when the fog rolls into Stevie Wayne's radio station and she frantically and fearfully tries her best to defend herself from the unknown.<br /><br />"The Fog" has its flaws, as do most movies of this type. However, I somehow manage to overlook them each time I watch because I get caught up in the characters and the story. There are few enough horror movies that are made in the style of "The Fog," and when one is made that makes you want to watch the movie a second or third time, you know it is a winner.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Antonio Bay is a small town by the sea, with a deadly past.  The town's Founding Fathers, in an effort to gain money to build their new town, caused the wreck of a ship carrying gold.  They thought they could put the past behind them.  They were wrong.<br /><br />A fog is slowly creeping into town.  With it come menacing figures...the ghosts of the dead sailors.  They want their revenge.  Six sacrifices, and the return of their gold.  And if they do not get this...then there will be hell to pay in Antonio Bay.  And not even God will be able to help them.<br /><br />Staring Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh (the two, by the way, do NOT play mother-daughter characters), Nick Castle, and Hal Holbrook as a brooding and creepy Father Malone, "The Fog" is one of those great horror movies that doesn't involve much violence or gore (though there are indeed some shocking scenes); what's frightening is what you don't see, and what you are afraid of.  With great casting and directing by John Carpenter, this is a horror film fans of the genre cannot afford to miss.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>After the smash success of his 1978 horror/suspense classic HALLOWEEN, director John Carpenter, along with his producer Debra Hill, instead of exploiting that film's success with a sequel (for the time being, anyway), decided to make a ghost story.  The result, the 1980 thriller THE FOG, was almost certainly the first really good horror film of the Eighties, one that for the most part was otherwise dominated by HALLOWEEN-inspired slasher movies.<p>Like Hitchcock's THE BIRDS and Spielberg's JAWS, THE FOG is set in a seaside community.  This time, it's Antonio Bay, on the coast of Northern California, near Point Reyes.  The community is about to celebrate its 100th anniversary of existence, and a lot of people are in attendance.  But, in the film's prologue, as an old man of the sea (John Houseman) relates it to some kids, we learn that a crew of leper pirates had been led to a watery grave while being guided by a lighthouse beacon onshore shining through a very thick fog bank.  Now, these same pirates are about to take their revenge on the people and visitors of Antonio Bay, shrouded by that very same thick blanket of fog that sent them to their doom a century before.<p>As with HALLOWEEN, Carpenter has sought to limit the violence and gore that was starting to become part-and-parcel of most commercial horror films of the time.  Instead, he opts for a combination of supernatural horror, mystery, and suspense, as Antonio Bay's townsfolk find themselves at the mercy of a past they thought they had put behind them.  And for this, Carpenter has assembled a tresure trove of actors--Jamie Lee Curtis (HALLOWEEN); her real-life mother Janet Leigh (PSYCHO); Hal Holbrook (ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN); Charles Cyphers; and Nancy Loomis, to name just a few.  Although some plot holes do lessen the experience somewhat, THE FOG still succeeds as an atmospheric thriller, largely thanks to Carpenter's own piano-dominated music score, the eerie fog effects, and Dean Cundey's superb cinematography.<p>Only a handful of horror movies from this point on would ever really be considered classic material.  THE FOG is admittedly slightly imperfect, but in comparison to much of the dreck that followed in the 1980s, it is very much a classic nevertheless.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>The Fog has always been misunderstood. Perceived initially as a failure because it didn't deliver the shocks of Halloween and the respectable but far from outstanding box office, The Fog is actually a superior ghost story and attempt by John Carpenter and Debra Hill to try something new. The Fog is an eerie mood piece that has far more going on than meets the eye.<p>On the 100th Anniversary of Antonio Bay the community has elected to hold a celebration and unveil a statue to their forebearers. Unfortunately, there's a curse associated with the community that no one is aware of. 100 years before six founding members of the community caused a clipper ship to crash on the rocks. All the crew and passengers were killed. Why and how it happened is part of the mystery of the story.<p>During the witching hour on the anniversary of the crash, an eerie fog rolls in occupied by the ghosts of that clipper ship. The Fog itself has an uncanny ability to cause electrical appliances to fail, cars to stall and furniture to mysterious move across the room. <p>Clearly Carpenter was attempting to tell a much more complex ghost/revenge story than slasher film Halloween. Although The Fog isn't as accomplished (or confident)as Halloween, the cast and ambitions carry the film. Carpenter's attempt to make The Fog itself a character is very successful. You can see hints of later Carpenter masterpieces such as The Thing in this early effort.<p>The transfer is from a nearly pristine and beautiful print of the film. The extras include the original featurette on the film and a new documentary chronicling the making of the film. Also included are a brief storyboard to film comparison (which, admittedly, could have included a bit more), the trailers, photos and some outtakes.<p>MGM does a terrific job on this DVD, Carrie and The Howling. Clearly they've taken their reissues of MGM and Avco-Embassy productions seriously. I can't imagine Anchor Bay or Criterion doing a better job for a single disc special edtion such as this.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>After the wild success of "Halloween", I'm not sure anyone expected John Carpenter to do a movie as frightening as "The Fog". It starts out perfectly, with John Houseman (as an old salt) telling the tale of how the "Elizabeth Dane" sank off "Spivey Point", drowning all aboard. He tells this story to a group of kids at exactly 11:55 pm (you'll understand why this is significant when you see it). This is a classic intro to a classic chiller! Adrienne Barbeau stars as disc jockey / KAB radio owner "Stevie Wayne", broadcasting from  her lighthouse radio station. Jamie Lee (Halloween) Curtis is Beth, a hitchhiker on her way to Vancouver. Hal Holbrook is the Priest of the local church. He uncovers (more like it almost drops in his lap) a terrible secret about his grandfather; a secret involving conspiracy and murder. A murder plot that results in the founding of the town. A curse is being fulfilled this night, the one hundred year anniversary of the small town. There's something in the fog. It moves against the wind and seems to glow. Just what IS it?? This is a scary flick! I've seen it many times and still jump and squirm in spots! Watch it with Halloween on a cold, dark night. You'll chew your nails to nubs! The music is great as well. Carpenter has a way with simple, repetative, yet creepy as hell sounds. Lock your doors. Bolt your windows. And whatever you do, DON'T GO OUT IN THE FOG...</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>This is one of the best of its genre.  The atmospheric direction and musical score are truly outstanding.  Carpenter works from a literate script and is supported by terrific actors.  Everyone involved in this film contributes their best work and it shows.  This film failed to find an audience when it was first released, but developed a cult following when it was released on VHS/DVD and its fanbase continues to grow and with good reason.  It's an outstanding film but it was released at a time when slasher films were ruling the box-office.  I just recently let my children see The Fog (they are 10 and 14) and it is not only among their favorite thrillers, but also their favorite films.  Like their dad, they love a good horror story and not a senseless slasher gorefest where teenagers line up to be killed after having sex and doing drugs.  There is a good reason why those redundant flicks lost their audience; they forgot they were suppose to scare us and not just jolt us with violent images.<br /><br />John Carpenter has done both slasher films, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305546789">Halloween</a> which was better than most flicks during its time, but also thoughtful, literate, well-paced, suspenseful, films that linger in your mind long after the experience of watching them is over.  Consider his other notable films like his remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002CHK1S">The Thing</a> starring the ever reliable Kurt Russell and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767812166">Starman</a> where Jeff Bridges gave us a well-deserved oscar-nominated performance.  The only issue I have with Carpenter is that he is terribly inconsistent and at one moment you gives you his best, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CWUI">Music of the Heart</a> and the next moment he gives you a half-hearted effort at best as with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AOX0F">They Live</a>.  When he's "on", awesome, and when he's off, he's comatose.</p></br><a href="../users/A35WVFSULRE1G9.html">A35WVFSULRE1G9</a><br/><p>This film is a hell of a good ride. Great visuals, soundtrack outstanding, and Jamie Lee in all her glory. A good old fashioned ghost story. The use of widescreen is mesmerising and visually, a well shot and beautiful film. Can't name another horror film that uses so much light or daytime, and is still downright spooky. Not a huge hit in 1980 but found a strong core of fans through video. Currently remaking it, why, no idea, no one is original anymore. Pick this up, make the popcorn, turn the lights down, and enjoy some good suspense. Every date I have had, cling to me so hard, worth it for that. Serious, a hell of a good film, without the gore and nudity which many horror films feel they need. Carpenter's soundtrack is outstanding, melodic and piercing. 5.1 this dvd, turn it up, you will jump, guaranteed. Enjoy this John Carpenter classic. Sympathy to Debra Hill, co-author, producer, who passed away early this year. She and her talents will sorely be missed. A little trivia, Blake, the lead ghost is played by Rob Bottin, the fx wiz of the film. No cgi in these days, the fog was actually dry ice or fog machines. Tough to direct that, when it wants to do its own thing. John Carpenter's cameo,(ala Hitchcock), Bennett at the beginning asking Father Malone to be paid. The little boy, Andy, is in Halloween II, with the razorblade in the mouth, ouch.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>This is a definite must for any Barbeau collector. She keeps up her high standards found in "Swamp Thing" (1982) and "Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death" (1989).  This film also is designed to add to your John Carpenter collection.<br /><br />Fog night and slow pacing will drive you up the wall. The unseen is just as spooky as the seen. There is gold, revenge, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Janet Leigh. What, want more? What if we throw in John Houseman and Hal Holbrook? Still more? There is a lot more. But don't get greedy. Sit back and enjoy what you can see in The Fog.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A7Q1UQ">Swamp Thing ~ Louis Jourdan</a></p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>How do you follow up the immensely popular and genre-shifting classic HALLOWEEN?  Carpenter could've rushed HALLOWEEN II, but wisely chose THE FOG as his follow-up.  Given a much bigger budget than its predecessor, Carpenter gives us some gorgeous scenery, scary scary fog, a haunting score, and a dilly of a ghost story.  Adrienne Barbeau has a great voice for an easy listening radio program, and her performance is admirable considering most of it is solo.  Jamie Lee seems happy to lose the virginal Laurie and play the floozie-ish role.  Janet Leigh, Jamie's famous Psycho mommy, is over the hill in her role as the town's &quot;unofficial&quot; mayor, and offers solid support.  Nancy Loomis and Charles Cyphers return from &quot;Halloween&quot; also and Loomis is fun, Cyphers again proves he's only a presence, little more, but he's not in it too long anyway.  John Houseman is the perfect ghost story teller; Hal Holbrook, like Leigh, dives into his role with that great actor on vacation role, and the ending will knock your head off!!!!<br />THE FOG is not destined to be the classic HALLOWEEN has become, but it is a frightening film and proved young Carpenter and Debra Hill (his co-writer and producer) knew what they were doing.  Unfortunately, the only other real winner for Carpenter is his remake of THE THING.  His last movie, GHOST OF MARS, is an atrocity.<br />But sit back and enjoy this with the lights off.  You'll never like sea chanties again!</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>THE FOG is a suspense/horror film about what happens in the coastal town of Antonio Bay on the eve of it's 100th anniversary.  Legend tells about a mysterious, glowing fog that has taken lives and swallowed ships over the years, but no one believes those tales until the eve of Antonio Bay's cenntenial. Car alarms, bells, whistles, and sirens go off for no apparent reason. A ship disappears. Windows break and strange knocks are heard at people's doors. When the missing ship is found, looking like it had been lost for centuries at sea and one of the dead crew members on board comes to life on an examination table, people know something strange is about to happen. As it turns out, Father Malone (Hal Holbrook) knows why the funning going-ons are happening. Antonio Bay was founded by six men who murdered a ship full of lepers after having taken their money. The lepers are back and want revenge and the Fog is how they will do it.<p>The film has a great cast, including Adrienne Barbeau and Jamie Lee Curtis; a decent script; and some simple, yet effective effects. John Carpenter (as he did with HALLOWEEN) relied upon suspense more than graphic horror to send thrills done spines. A very good suspenseful horror flick that's especially delightful to watch on an evening alone in the fog.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS7LYGLUX34L.html">ATS7LYGLUX34L</a><br/><p>Finally! The Fog comes to DVD! The Fog is one of my favorite horror films, and it's great to see it get the full DVD treatment!<p>  The plot is simple: On her 100th anniversary, the small hamlet of Antonio Bay is beseiged by a strange fog, cloaking the vengeful ghosts of a murdered leper colony, whose deaths provided the wealth necessary to start the town. Writer/Director John Carpenter gets right to the point, and there isn't a wasted frame of film in this tightly paced chiller. The scene where the men on the fishing boat see the ghost-ship is one of the classic movie creep-outs, and the ending is great. This film  really harks back to the old ghost story films of the 40's.<p>  The DVD is full-frame on one side, and the widescreen side of the disc has all of the extras, including commentary by Carpenter and co-writer/producer Debra Hill, an old documentary and a made-for-the-DVD documentary, trailers and commercials, posters and print ads, and lots more. (I would have liked to have seen more about the makeup effects for Blake and his crew, but that's just me...) The film transfer is GREAT- The Fog has never looked better, and the colors are lovely and vibrant. I even managed to find an easter egg! On the &quot;Special features&quot; screen, tab up until a pair of glowing eyes appear in the fog- press enter and you'll see a brief (a little under three minutes) music video of behind-the-scenes-footage from the making of the film.<p>  Overall, The Fog is a must-have for fans of Ghost stories or John Carpenter. Now lets see Escape From New York and Prince of Darkness get the deluxe treatment.....</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This vintage John Carpenter film was made in collaboration with Debra Hill, who with Carpenter was responsible for the runaway success of "Halloween". When "The Fog" was first released, it was met with a fairly lukewarm reception. It has since gone on to achieve some acclaim, though it has never reached the heights of commercial success touched upon by "Halloween", though, then again, few films have.<br /><br />"The Fog" is a highly atmospheric ghost story. The ghosts manifest themselves on the stroke of midnight, as the fishing village of Antonio Bay gets ready to celebrate its centennial. As the midnight hour rolls in, so does an unearthly fog that begins to engulf the whole town. It is a fog that enshrouds of the ghosts of those whose ship was lured to the rocky coast, only to find itself dashed to bits on the rocks, causing all aboard to plummet to the nether regions of Davy Jones' locker. These ghosts are now hell bent on seeking revenge for their fate on the inhabitants of Antonio bay.<br /><br />The special effects in the film are excellent, as is the musical score composed by none other than John Carpenter himself. This is for the most part a subtle, creepy film, highlighted by a stellar cast. If you are looking for a blood and gore slasher film, this is not the film for you. If, however, you enjoy a terse, tightly written script, as well as a pulse pounding musical score, then you will enjoy this highly atmospheric, ghost story. I originally saw this film in the theatre when it was first released and still remember the effectiveness of the fog rolling across the huge silver screen and the pulse pounding, musical score, which was such an excellent accompaniment to the film. Time has not diminished its power.<br /><br />This well priced DVD is an excellent value with pristine visuals and clear audio. It is a fully loaded DVD that includes two documentaries, one of which was made a the time of the film's release and one made recently. It is interesting to see and hear some of those who were involved with this film as they appeared then and as they look now. One may also elect to view the film in either full screen or letterbox format.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A.html">A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A</a><br/><p>so says jamie lee curtis early on in "the fog" john carpenter's follow up to "halloween".with a little more money and more time to craft the film mr. carpenter gives us the deluxe film ghost story. and much like his hero,john ford, mr.carpenter has his stock company of players that you see in every movie.<br /><br />  this ghost story starts as we hear an old man telling stories to kids(john houseman is a great little role that he looks to enjoy). his last story of the night tells how the town was founded after a ship is run into the rocks and sunk after an "unearthly fog" rolled in and a fire on shore lead them astray.<br /><br />  later that night, three fisherman sight an old sailing ship and meet very bad endings,and at midnight the whole town goes crazy.the local rev.(hal holbrock,having a ball) finds his greatgrandfathers diary and learns the people 100 years ago wrecked the ship of a leper who had lots of gold and wanted to build a coloney near the town. the town wanted the gold just not the lepers.well the lepers want the gold back and the also want payback for the 100 years under the water.<br /><br />  the movie is creepy and very fun to watch(we even get jamie and her mom janet leigh workint together for the first time). as with most of his films the gore is very slight,so if thats what you like stay away, but if great ghost stories and a smart story are your thing you will love it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This vintage John Carpenter film was made in collaboration with Debra Hill, who with Carpenter was responsible for the runaway success of "Halloween".

These ghosts are now hell bent on seeking revenge for their fate on the inhabitants of Antonio bay.<br /><br />The special effects in the film are excellent, as is the musical score composed by none other than John Carpenter himself. This is for the most part a subtle, creepy film, highlighted by a stellar cast. If you are looking for a blood and gore slasher film, this is not the film for you. If, however, you enjoy a terse, tightly written script, as well as a pulse pounding musical score, then you will enjoy this highly atmospheric, ghost story. I originally saw this film in the theatre when it was first released and still remember the effectiveness of the fog rolling across the huge silver screen and the pulse pounding, musical score, which was such an excellent accompaniment to the film.

All that is required is the talent, the mood, a great location, a creepy story and VOILA!!<br /><br />The story takes place in Antonio Bay. A depressingly gloomy but charming seaside town whose inhabitants become the victims of a thick, glowing fog carrying the angry ghosts of lepers who were killed in a shipwreck a century earlier. What makes these ghosts even more frightening is that they are not of the "transparent" kind. They're covered in rags, dripping in salt water and armed with knives, hooks, swords and possibly every other sharp, metallic object you can think of.<br /><br />The cast is first-rate. The stand-out performer is Carpenter's then-wife, Adriene Barbeau who plays Stevie Wayne. A sexy radio disc-jocky who becomes trapped inside a light-house while the rest of the cast seeks refuge in an old church outside of town. Scream-Queens Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh and Nancy Loomis co-star as the other luck-less female victim's and put their screaming talents to good use. The legendary John Houseman makes a great cameo appearance in the opening sequence, setting the tone. The great cast, the location, the creative fog effects and a simple yet effective Carpenter score all contribute in making this low-budget chiller a winner.<br /><br />However, it should be stated that THE FOG is far from perfect. Despite a chilling first 20 minutes, the film takes its time in building it's tension and therefore drags quite a bit. And even those who love this movie will admit that it's no where near as effective as Carpenter's HALLOWEEN and under close inspection, plot holes become too apparent. But us fans don't seem to care since we all know that THE FOG is not to be taken THAT seriously. It's about a killer fog, people. Anyone approaching this for the plot or character development is sorely lacking "upstairs". Film's such as these need to be viewed solely for 2 purposes- To be entertained and to be scared and if you are a horror fan (like I am) you should find plenty to like. By combining several different branches off the horror genre and using it to great effect, THE FOG is a cross between POLTERGEIST, HALLOWEEN and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD all rolled into one.<br /><br />So forget all of this CGI stuff for a minute and see what a true horror movie should really be like. THE FOG is simple yet deeply chilling and atmospheric. Follow it with Carpenter's ultimate classic (you know which movie I'm talking about) and double your pleasure.<br /><br />There's a reason why this low-budget shocker is so beloved by fans of the genre. Recommended.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>It's been a long time since I've seen this movie, so I won't comment on it too specifically, but I feel I've gotta say something now that it's being discussed a bit more.  Simply put, this movie is passable, and certainly not one of Carpenter's better efforts.  In their eternal rage over the recent popularity of the remake, some people like to imagine that whatever original is a classic.  This one isn't.  It wants to be atmospheric, but it's mostly just uneventful, and endless shots of fog banks aren't especially fascinating, and the bland characters yakking it up aren't terribly remarkable either.  The ghost-sailor-zombies are pretty neat, but they don't actually do all that much that we get to see.  I don't remember much of anything about the characters at this point, so they must not have been very fascinating, though I do recall being irritated by Jamie Lee Curtis, as per usual.  Again, this film is passably interesting, but Carpenter just can't quite generate enough  atmosphere to make up  for the fact that nothing is actually going on.  And though the fog looks pretty nice most of the time, the cinematography is generally pretty bland.  (There is one major exception in the form of an excellent shot of a number of ghosts standing in the church, but that's about it.)  And, the opening attack on the ship at the beginning is pretty well done, nicely transferring Carpenter's slasher skills to a new genre.  But, the film is a whole is just kinda blah.  Not quite boring, but far from engrossing, and it has a fairly anti-climactic ending.<br /><br />Frankly, this movie is a perfect candidate for  remake.  Good concept, passable execution.  Course, the remake is pretty lousy, but it didn't have to be.  If they'd hired some talented people to write and direct it, it probably coulda been pretty good.  Though I find it utterly hilarious that people are whining about how this  material will 'watered down' for the remake. Hah!  This movie isn't gory at all, as in it doesn't have ANY gore in it.  We see a few blades and hooks poke at a shirt.  That's about it.  The remake is actually substantially more graphic than the original, and there is no way in hell that this version would be rated R is it had been released this year. (Well, I won't go quite that far.  The MPAA might give anything any rating at any time, but they'd have to be far more confused than usual to place an R on this again.)  Apparently some people failed to notice that modern rating standards are a helluva lot more lax than they used to be.  Hell, 'The Fog' was less graphic than some PG movies even at the time.  'Jaws', for example, is far more graphic than this, and that came out like 7 years before this.  I think they use the, ahem, f-word like once in this movie, which may well be the real reason for the R.<br /><br />Most people are gonna tell you, 'Don't see that crappy remake, see this amazing, innovative original!!!'  Well, I dunno if you really need to see either of them, particularly if you're not a huge horror fan.  Just go watch 'The Thing' again, or perhaps check out Carpenter's underappreciated 'In the Mouth of Madness'.  If you're a non-discriminating horror junkie like me, you might as well see them both.  It's actually a kinda interesting case study, as the original is a too low-key, whereas the remake is way overdone, particularly at the end. (Where it becomes quite comically over the top.)  Though, you definitely shouldn't see the remake until you've seen the original.  It just isn't proper, and it is the better of the two, if not by all that much..  But yeah, whatever, I've already talked about these films more than they deserve.<br /><br />Grade: C</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>This is John Carpenter's follow-up to Halloween (one of the best movies ever).  This movie doesn't quite measure-up.  It's scary, but it does not have memorable characters.  It's a creepy and in-your-face horror movie.<p>The extras on the DVD, like on The Thing, tell you everything you'd want to know about the movie, and TOO MUCH MORE.  A huge problem with DVD extras is that it tends to treat every film as if it were Citizen Kane.  It could use a lot of editing.  Listening to the principals talk about the film, it's difficult to tell if they think it is a success or not.  Unfortunately, every time I've seen John Carpenter lately (in person or on TV) he seems like he's smoked a few too many doobies to ever form a coherent thought again.  It's a shame because he had so much talent.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>After a watch of the film with whatever cover colour you want, this is a great piece of work.<br /><br />The end product delivers the goods in so many different ways.<br /><br />Whilst it is most definitely a thriller, it is a thriller on a par with none, and most importantly, it is based on a real historical event, but motivated by a trip to Stone Henge.<br /><br />The Documentary features reveal much about the two stage  process that was used in production. The commentary covers as much as any film fan could hope to want in this DVD. The Features deliver interviews done at the time of the original release, and Three very good  reasons to see the film are Adrienne Barbeau ( the actual Lead in the Script), The ever loveable Jamie Lee, and her superbly Gorgous Mom... oh, and a great and spooky film story that is ramped up by Rob Bottins great FX, Hal Holbrooks superb Performance, and some very good second unit work, to supplement the mood created by the main production work.<br /><br />ENJOY</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>I orginally watched this version before I saw the remake of it. I definately liked the remake better than this version. Probably because it was more updated than this one. Also, in this version it is like they took the thriller affect only so far. They did not tip it over the top like they did in the remake. I did like this version as well though. It was very scarey in it't time and also this is a very well known movie. All in all, it was a very fun movie to watch on a cold winter's night. I do recommend this movie to all of the "horror classic fans".</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This vintage John Carpenter film was made in collaboration with Debra Hill, who with Carpenter was responsible for the runaway success of "Halloween".

In a time when movies are all but drown in CGI special effects and shed only mere crumbs of atmosphere in comparison to this flick, it's time for "The Fog," to come "rolling" in on DVD.  The comment made about this being a "great film for film students," could not be anymore true!  John Carpenter was the master at creating creepy visuals without using a lot of sound effects.  Many of the sound effects you do here in John Carpenters earlier works are simple, short and spooky as hell!  Unfortunately, by today's Hollywood standards lots of blood and unnecessary dialogue is necessary and effective to convolute a second rate story. (Joke)  The horror genre is far from dead but it's gonna take someone to learn a thing or two from movies like "The Fog," to bring those attributes to life.  Amazon.com and the powers that be, bring this movie to DVD NOW!!!  It's time for a new generation of viewers to take notice of this brilliant and highly effective horror film!</p></br><a href="../users/A2E9TRM8096BXU.html">A2E9TRM8096BXU</a><br/><p>"The Fog" is a fairly typical representative of a John Carpenter movie. It certainly has its moments, yet it leaves the viewer with an unmistakable feeling of "what might have been." In this sense it reminds me a bit of Michael Mann's 1985 version of F. Paul Wilson's "The Keep", another fascinating yet flawed horror movie which I watch over and over again in the vain hopes of discovering that it is actually good.<br /><br />Stripped to the bone, "The Fog" is the story of a small New England fishing town which is about to celebrate its centennial (or bicentennial....or anniversary of some type). On the eve of this occasion the local priest, a drunken sot played by Hal Holbrook, discovers that the town - like all horror movie small towns - has a terrible secret linked to its founding. This discovery coincides with the appearance of a nasty fog off the coast which tends to leave dead people in its wake, and is moving towards the town. Various characters in the town, including a local beer-guzzler (Tom Atkins) a nubile hitch-hiker (Jamie Lee Curtis) a radio deejay (Adrienne Barbeau) and so on, are all isolated by the fog and soon discover what is inside it, and how it is related to the "terrible secret", an old sin for which the modern-day townsfolk mist pay.<br /><br />As you can see, while the idea is not exactly new it is pretty cool, and when I popped "The Fog" into my ancient DVD player recently I did so after a hiatus of many years, with the hope that my earlier judgement on the film was wrong. In this I was disappointed. Like "The Keep", "The Fog" never gets any better; unlike "The Keep" it actually gets worse.<br /><br />On paper this should not have happened. Besides Carpenter, who was coming off well-received efforts like "Assault on Precinct 13" and "Halloween" there is an impressive cast of actors which actually reunites a good bit of the original "Halloween" crew. Besides Carptenter and Jamie Lee Curtis, there is also the girl who played Annie (Michael's first onscreen victim), as well as the guy who played the Sheriff in both H and H-2. Replacing the ubiquitous Donald Pleasance is Hal Halbrook, and the venerable John Houseman makes an appearance in the film's opening as a creepy, storytellin' sea captain. Even Janet Leigh is involved, as the bitchy yet rather likable wife of a Fog victim. Ironically, tis is part of the film's problem, and it has many.<br /><br />First off, there are far too many characters. The film is cluttered with them and for some reason Carpenter disobeyed the standard horror movie order of whittling them down as the film progresses. Most of the victims are throwaways in no way integral to the plot, and nearly everybody introduced at the beginning is still walking around at the end. We needed more killings, not less.<br /><br />Second, the performances. This movie has good actors, but the dialogue is at best inconsistent and at worst embarrassingly stupid. The worst of it is ladeled onto Adrienne Barbeau, who gets to repeat idiocies like, "My son is trapped! Trapped by the fog!" and "Look out, into the darkness....and beware of the fog!" Gag.<br /><br />Third, the villain(s). Carptenter achieved some neatly creepy atmosphere at the beginning of the film, but he never delivers on it: there is no real payoff. This is because he couldn't seem to decide whether it was the fog itself or what was IN the fog was the actual "baddie" of the film. The result is that no one antagonist ever really emerges. "The Fog" might as well be a run o' the mill flood - faceless and impersonal.<br /><br />The movie does have its moments -- the creepy opening, the moments of atmospheric horror at sea, and the excellent cinematography, which is used to particular effect on the creepy fog-dwellers. But in the end these fail to outweigh the movie's many flaws.<br /><br />As of today, I still regard Carptenter as the most wildly inconsistent director out there. On the one hand he gave us P-13, Halloween, Escape from New York, and The Thing, all classics (cult or otherwise). On the other hand he also gave us crap like Prince of Darkness and the unwatchable Ghosts of Mars. In between there are the fun but flawed outings like They Live and In the Mouth of Madness. I would like to say that The Fog falls in this last category, but I really can't. It just isn't very good, and that's the sad fact of it. Bottom line? Beware The Fog.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q4XAQXKKV6V.html">A3Q4XAQXKKV6V</a><br/><p>...the Thing (***), the Fog (**), Ghosts on Mars (-*)Vampires (-**) seem to try and recapture the magic of Halloween, like the score in the Fog really tries to be Halloween but falls apart from its unoriginality. ... The mood and sets of this movie are actually really pretty good. The set-up is great, the first hour is very nice, but the movie quickly devolves into a real witless piece of revenge. (Um, why do the zombies come back 100 years later? How do they know it's 100 years later? Do they have calanders? Why even take revenge on the town NOW? They didn't do anything to you zombie folk.)<p>I just have to ask, why do drowned zombies KNOCK on the door trying to get in? The first time I saw this, I was like, OK, that has to be someone else leading us to believe it is one of the villians... but sure enough, the zombies knock on the door trying to get in! How polite!<p>The transfer, sound and extras on this are really great and add quite a bit of value to this movie... however you must like the movie first for it to matter... John Carpenter says during the commentary that Hal Holbrook didn't like the movie when it was finished. I have to second that. I like elements of it, but the movie as a whole doesn't measure up to his previous works, I mean work, Halloween.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Fog is a campy 80s movie.

The movie has a eerie, creepy look and feel to it that I haven't noticed in a horror film besides &quot;Halloween&quot;. The killer sailors themselves, are very scary. In fact, most of the film is. Jamie Lee Curtis doesn't get enough scare time in this film than &quot;Halloween&quot;, which is a shame. Adrienne Barbeau is more of the heroine in this film. It's also a hoot to see an ecclectic cast that also includes John Houseman, Hal Holbrook, Janet Leigh, and &quot;Halloween&quot; veteran Nancy Loomis. This is one spooky classic that's destined to leave you creeped out. Don't watch it on cloudy days with the lights off!. The Fog is coming...</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>John Carpenter's "The Fog" is a worthy follow-up to his horror masterpiece, "Halloween."  While nowhere near as terrifying or as polished as the first Michael Meyers tale, "The Fog" offers up several treats for horror fans in addition to some genuine scares.<br /><br />There may not be a better opening to a horror film.  A bunch of kiddies sit by a campfire late at night on the beach as old, grizzled John Houseman spins a yarn about the ghosts of a lost ship that foundered off this very same coastline exactly 100 years ago.  Not one of those kids slept a wink after that tale, rest assured.<br /><br />It appears that this old tale is true . . . 100 years ago, a wealthy local man sought to found a leper colony nearby (he had caught the disease as well), and this didn't appeal to the local villagers.  So six of them used a campfire to lure the shipful of lepers onto the rocks at night, causing the shipwreck and the loss of all hands.  Being civic-minded scoundrels, the six murderers then stole the wealthy leper's gold and founded the town of Antonio Bay, which now celebrates its centennial.<br /><br />Carpenter and his "Halloween" collaborator Debra Hill build on this excellent story foundation by assembling one heck of a cast.  Jamie Lee Curtis (given the immortal line, "Bad things seem to happen near me"), Adrienne Barbeau, and Janet Leigh all feature in "The Fog," as does the aforementioned Mr. Houseman and also Hal Holbrook as a tormented pastor.<br /><br />Carpenter and Hill also create a great look for "The Fog."  Shot in 1980, the special effects are low-tech, but that is part of the appeal.  Unable to capitalize on today's CGI effects, Carpenter's team used wit and talent to create some terror out of primitive special effects, a fog machine, and some lamps.  Believe me, it works.<br /><br />The story's execution is a bit weak.  While there are many intriguing setups (Ms. Barbeau's radio station is perfectly situated on a precarious cliff overlooking the ocean, where she can watch the fog roll into town while screaming warnings over the radio and also placing her in dire peril), there is a lot of silliness, too.  Jamie Lee Curtis gets picked up as a hitchhiker by a local, and before you know it we see them in bed post-coitus . . . and *then* they introduce themselves.  Ms. Barbeau also makes some rather quick leaps to the correct deduction that the fog is lethal.  And a dead seaman lurches to his feet to attack an unsuspecting victim in a hospital . . . but somehow misses and falls inert to the floor, and nobody says anything other than "you okay"?  Hmmm.<br /><br />There's also a bit of concern over the tale of vengeance.  The story veers from the fog (and its ghosts) taking out anyone who comes into contact with it to a tale of exacting specific revenge against the descendants of the six murderers who lured the leper ship to its doom.  The story has trouble deciding.  (Although it's nice to see that the fog has remained current on technical matters, being able to take out phone lines and power generators -- it's silly, but does help create the proper tension.)<br /><br />"The Fog" is easy to dismiss after 25 years with its low-tech special effects, its story holes, and the incredibly weak music selection of the local deejays.  But it gets certain things exactly right -- the creepy look of fog sweeping in off the ocean, the terror of opening the door and looking out into the murk, and the haunting soundtrack of Mr. Carpenter.  (Perhaps its not as famous as the "Halloween" score, but it should be.)<br /><br />Maybe people in sunny, arid climates can laugh off "The Fog" as a silly, unworthy follow-up to "Halloween."  Maybe.  But in Portland, Oregon, we get our fair share of foggy nights, and I can guarantee that the next time I'm out in the fog, I'm going to be looking over my shoulder.  That's a calling card of a good horror flick!</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>Talk about bad weather! When the fog rolls in on a sleepy coastal village, its townspeople find themselves being stalked by a group of vengeful sea-faring ghosts, whose hundred year slumber has finally come to an end. Strange occurrences pile up as the body-count rises before folks wise up to what is happening, but is it too late to save the town, and more importantly, themselves?<br /><br />A chilling score, spooky atmosphere and an authentic sea-side setting all combine to make this one of the best ghost stories of the 80's and one of writer/director John Carpenter's personal best as well. It also helps that the film is host to one of the ensemble casts in horror history. Carpenter regulars such as Charles Cyphers, Adrienne Barbeau and Nancy Loomis star alongside the likes of Jamie Lee Curtis (reuniting with Carpenter for the first time since "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RIWAVW">Halloween</a>"), Janet Leigh and Hal Holbrook. Heck, there's even 80's horror/cult icon Tom Atkins, who you'll notice is without his trademark mustache. The film itself, like all of Carpenter's best work, moves at a slow pace, bubbling with a sense of dread and mounting suspense before releasing its knockout conclusion.<br /><br />Sandwiched between more celebrated Carpenter classic such as "Halloween," "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783227507">The Thing</a>" and "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004Y87O">Escape from New York</a>", "The Fog" is often overlooked and in turn, is one of the director's most underrated films. Certain aspects of the film might make it appear dated (the cars, the haircuts) but the film still holds up as a classy and thrilling little chiller. Those looking for a thick slice of supernatural suspense will clearly find what they need in "The Fog".</p></br><a href="../users/A35WVFSULRE1G9.html">A35WVFSULRE1G9</a><br/><p>First off, this film is fantastic, read my other review. Just had to comment on this new dvd release. NOTHING NEW, different color case, provoking potential buyers to get this, that its an upgrade, not hardly. Execs. want a few more bucks in there pockets with the remake coming out soon. People, be original, leave classic films alone, I have never seen a remake that was better. They ever try to remake Jaws, I'll steal every film negative and burn them. Upgrade Jaws fine, like Star Wars, a little cgi for the phony shark scenes but that is it. The Fog is awesome, but the remake differs, I bet the music is different, obviously the story is, because someone is trapped under water in a car being chased by a ghost. So the teenage market probably has no idea there is a Carpenter version, rerelease the original, it stands the test of time. The new version was never even screened to reviewers untill after its release. That says alot, no confidence, hollywood moguls suck. Gee why not redo every Brady Bunch episode with new hip people, NOT. I balk at this dvd release. The film, 5 stars, this reissue 0.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>I saw John Carpenter's "The Fog" (1980) years ago and was kind of bored by it. Catching it again recently, however, I was impressed by quite a few things:<br /><br />-- The film has MOOD. Carpenter successfully captured a fitting spooky atmosphere for his ghost story. (The plot involves the horrific ghosts of a ship of lepers returning to enact revenge on a coastal community 100 years after the people of that village guided them to a rocky death in order to swipe their chest of gold).<br /><br />The spooky mood is nicely captured in the very first scene wherein John Houseman shares the ghost story in hushed tones to a group of kids at a campfire on the coast.<br /><br />-- Spectacular locations. The picture was filmed in the beautiful Point Reyers/Bodega Bay region North of San Francisco.<br /><br />-- Fabulous score. Especially the main piano piece that runs during the end credits. It actually blows away the more popular main score to Carpenter's "Halloween."<br /><br />-- Good cast, which includes Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Hal Holbrook, Nancy Kyes and Janet Leigh.<br /><br />An unpredictable finish. I know this is a horror flick and people are supposed to die, but it's nice to see people NOT die for a change. It's refreshing!<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: If you're looking for a fast-paced slasher gore-fest, you will not like this film. If, however, you're in the mood for something spooky, atmospheric and aesthetically pleasing, "The Fog" will likely trip your trigger.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>If you were to ask me what favorite scary movie of mine is most overlooked and in dire need of more attention and recognition, I would most definitley say &quot;The Fog&quot;. The year was 1979, and director/writer/composer John Carpenter was just coming off the massive success of &quot;Halloween&quot;. What does he do as a follow up to that groundbreaking classic?. Well, he makes another one!. He and his longtime collaborator Debra Hill wrote the script for an old fashioned scary ghost tale. Mission accomplished guys. The story takes place in the idyllic seaside town of Antonio Bay, California. The town is on the verge of celebrating it's 100th anniversary, being runned by local resident Kathy Williams, played by screen great Janet Leigh. At the same time as the big festivities are getting underway, the town is beset by a strange, eerie fog that is more than meets the eye. As we find out through Father Malone(Hal Halbrook), the town of Antonio Bay is built on greed, deceit, and murder. A group of long dead mariners are exacting their revenge on the town and the descendants of the men who originally did them wrong and built what was to become the town on their horrible actions. Now, they want what's rightfully theirs back. And they come in and do it engulfed in a dense, terrifying fog. Caught up in the terror is a small group of people. Local DJ Stevie Wayne(Adrienne Barbeau, who was Carpenter's real life squeeze), her son Andy, hitchhiker Elizabeth(Jamie Lee Curtis), Nick(Tom Atkins), and a few others as well. John Houseman appears in a small cameo at the beginning of the film. There are a few gags in the film that you need to look out for. The Tom Atkins character is named Nick Castle. Nick Castle is the actor who played Michael Myers in the original &quot;Halloween&quot;. There are a few others, but I will let you find them on your own. As I mentioned earlier, this movie is horribly overlooked and underrated. It may not be &quot;Halloween&quot;, but it is a strong try that is almost as equally creepy and suspense filled as that film. It is vintage John Carpenter, down to the cool score, and this was the last film he did that I think was truly scary. He also has a cameo early on in the film at the church playing the 'Bennet' character. The movie is tightly written by Carpenter and Hill, and it moves along at a nice pace and it gets you all settled into the nice town and the residents we soon meet. As always in Carpenter films, it really sets the mood and takes you into the movie itself. Carpenter has a special knack for ringing terror and suspense by actually making it creepy and scary without having to resort to &quot;jump scares&quot; or gore. This one is a perfectly executed film with a perfect balance of scares and a strong tale to go with it. Some people might find it surprising that Jamie Lee Curtis has a smaller, co-starring role here. Barbeau is the real star and heroine. But it's kinda funny because the original poster for the film showcased Jamie Lee and no one else. Misleading, yes, but with her rising fame at the time and the success of &quot;Halloween&quot; a year before, it was a nice marketing move. &quot;The Fog&quot; did okay at the box office, but it kinda got lost afterwards and created a following over the years. Carpenter should be noted for doing this film just as much as he is for doing &quot;Halloween&quot;. It's gotten a resurgence over the years, and you can tell the influence it had on Kevin Williamson for the &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; movie. All in all, &quot;The Fog&quot; is a real exercise in smart and upstanding terror. A classic thriller that is just waiting to be re-discovered again so it can scare the pants off you.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>John Carpenter has a string of horror films in any fan of the genres Top 20, but sadly his latest efforts are complete hokum and he has pretty lost his touch. He should stick to what he does best - low budget original horror movies.<p>Make no mistake about it - "The Fog" has it in aces in every department by simply not trying to be more than what it is - an old fashioned ghost story. This is established within the first few moments as a fishermen tells some children a ghost story by a camp fire about a ship wreck. Then we launch into the film, about a small town by a harbor with characters preparing to celebrate the towns anniversary. It has all the feel that the town Amity had in "Jaws". Then some small strange happenings start occurring. An old book is found in the church which tells of an ancient conspiracy to sink a ship full of lepers. A strange glowing Fog is heading towards the port, a ghost ship is seen, a fishing vessel goes missing, there are strange knockings at peoples doors, an autopsy has a strange conclusion, a boy finds an old piece of drift wood with a name on it, a record player in the radio station starts to play ghostly voices.... Its got it all!<p>If you like John Carpenters work then you will love "The Fog" especially if you like his early low-budget work. The acting is quite functional for this type of story and it does scare. Watch it alone, at night to get the full effect. It is still as chilling today as it was then... those red eyes send a chill up my spine every time. The story is also highly original and very inventive in parts. It is also quite fast paced and there is never a dull moment. <p>Overall this is great horror film with a great plot and is essentially very scary. If you have not seen "The Fog" then it is about time that you get around to doing so. Get it today! You will not be disappointed. Notice that 95% of the reviews so far are above 3 stars. That says a lot!</p></br><a href="../users/A2V3P1XE33NYC3.html">A2V3P1XE33NYC3</a><br/><p>Thanks in large part to the frenetic efforts of John Carpenter, the horror film medium flourished in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Few fans of the genre need a reminder that Carpenter directed the classic &quot;Halloween,&quot; an independent film that went on to great success and eternal status as a cult classic. While the tale about the merciless Michael Myers certainly didn't invent the slasher film (look back to Mario Bava's classic &quot;Twitch of the Death Nerve&quot; to see an earlier effort), it influenced many others to carry the torch in the following years. Carpenter's follow up to &quot;Halloween,&quot; a nice little chiller called &quot;The Fog,&quot; moved rapidly away from a maniac wielding a knife and screaming teenagers, focusing instead on psychological terror and supernatural eeriness to scare the masses. Carpenter's recent films just don't compare with his early fright fests. That's a darn shame, but for horror aficionados, watching the troika of &quot;Halloween,&quot; &quot;The Fog,&quot; and &quot;The Thing&quot; will always deeply satisfy.<p>The citizens of the coastal town of Antonio Bay are proud of their town and its approaching centennial celebration. It's unfortunate the town harbors a gruesome secret dating back to 1880, but most of the residents know nothing about what the city founders did to the crew of the Elizabeth Dane on a foggy night back in the last century. Even the descendents of those hardy town fathers, one of them the town priest played by Hal Holbrook, aren't aware of the evil committed off of Spivey Point. When the discovery of a diary from one of the pioneering figures surfaces, it's far too late to stem the curse rising from the bottom of the sea. For the long dead crew of the Elizabeth Dane seeks bloody retribution for the crimes of Antonio Bay, and as the clock strikes midnight the townspeople have little idea of the terror moving in from the ocean. Now, everyone in town is fair game as ghosts with a grudge sweep through the streets. Possible victims include local radio station owner Stevie Wayne (Adrienne Barbeau), hitchhiker Elizabeth Stolley (Jamie Lee Curtis), Kathy Williams (Janet Leigh), and Nick Castle (Tom Atkins). As the body count rises and the fog grows thicker, the principal characters head to the local church and the final showdown between the ghosts and the townspeople.<p>I know several hardcore horror fans who dislike Carpenter's &quot;The Fog.&quot; They grumble about the lack of splatter effects, the reliance on fog as a crucial plot point, and the lack of screen time dedicated to Jamie Lee Curtis. Two of these arguments carry weight: there is a scarcity of gore and Jamie Lee Curtis is definitely not the star of the movie. Where I draw the line with these complaints concerns the claim that the fog doesn't provide enough chills. Like Stevie Wayne says several times during the movie, it's what's in the fog that brings disaster to the residents of Antonio Bay. The glowing, swirling mass hiding a hideous curse definitely worked for me, and it ought to work for other viewers as well. Cripes, this is a ghost story! What better way to introduce vengeful ghosts from a shipwreck than through a supernatural fog bank? Watching that pulsating fog roll in over the town bringing death to the descendents of the original settlers provided plenty of chills. Besides, if you really wish to criticize the film, look for a few improbabilities in the script. Why, for example, do the ghosts from the Elizabeth Dane seek to harm Stevie? She isn't one of the descendents of the town that the spirits hold accountable, yet the phantasms chase her with the intent of doing bodily harm. That question alone deserves more criticism than concerns over Curtis's screen time or a lack of gruesome scenes. Besides, Curtis apparently doesn't consider &quot;The Fog&quot; important enough to contribute a new interview for the DVD release. Both Janet Leigh and Adrienne Barbeau took the time to film a few comments, but Curtis is nowhere to be seen. <p>This DVD offers loads of extra goodies for the rabid Carpenter fan. Not only do you get an amazing transfer of the film in widescreen, you get other tidbits to wet your whistle. This special edition version comes with two documentaries about the film, one from 1980, the other made especially for this DVD. There are stills aplenty, a commentary with John Carpenter and screenwriter Debra Hill, tons of ultra cool television and movie screen trailers, a gallery of movie posters and advertisements, and a story board/ scene comparison. When you look at the price for the DVD, you know you're getting a great deal.<p>&quot;The Fog&quot; is great fun, a sort of old time horror tale brought up into the modern age. It's also neat to see John Houseman's introductory monologue outlining the tragedy of the Elizabeth Dane (along with Donald Pleasance's monologue in &quot;Halloween&quot; about Michael Myers, Carpenter knows how to create memorable background narratives!). Hal Holbrook's appearance here as the doomed Father Malone seems surprising, but the actor apparently appeared in another horror film around the same time, called &quot;Rituals&quot; in 1977. In fact, the ensemble cast does a great job in this creepy movie. If you're going to watch &quot;Halloween,&quot; and &quot;The Thing&quot; anytime soon, you might as well throw in &quot;The Fog&quot; while you're at it. It's worth your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FUBUJAIGM87T.html">A3FUBUJAIGM87T</a><br/><p>John Carpenter has long been one of my favorite horror movie directors ever since I can remember liking horror movies. Actually, I like many of his other movies too like the sci-fi/horror classic "The Thing" and the underrated "Escape from New York" just to name a few. To say that "Halloween" is the movie that has defined his career would be an understatement. Certainly, it was after the blockbuster success of "Halloween" that Carpenter realized that he really had a knack for horror cinema.<br /><br />A couple of years later in 1980, Carpenter made "The Fog" which was no where near the success of "Halloween", but one can see similarities in style and in the cast as well. While certainly not a classic, "The Fog" is an atmospheric ghost story that is creepy enough for a late night horror viewing experience. Carpenter does a good job once again of creating suspense and building tension in the audience. The fog itself is a brilliant mechanism to keep the audience in the dark about the evil that is lurking within the fog. The dark manifestations of the apparitions are quite creepy.<br /><br />The story behind the fog is interesting to a certain degree, and it does make sense. However, "The Fog" may have explained too much to the viewer because sometimes it is the lack of motive behind the horrific acts of the villain that makes us scared. Not that it hurts the movie too much, but Carpenter tries to explain things in this movie and some of the mystery behind the supernatural (at least with regard to motive) is unfortunately lost. In other words, Carpenter humanizes the supernatural with the motive in this movie, and that reduces the horror to a certain extent. Consequently, the movie really is not that scary, but it is creepy, atmospheric and eerie at times. Once again, I love the pulsating mood music Carpenter employs in "The Fog", but it is not enough to make this movie into a classic. I think it is interesting that many people perceive "The Fog" as a classic now as opposed to when it came out because when it first came out, it was not exactly received all that well. However, as time has gone by, people perceive "The Fog" to be somewhat of a classic, and I think that is the product of time itself. In other words, a decent movie like "The Fog" back in the early 80s has been given classic status nowadays because of the garbage that has been produced in the horror genre over the last seventeen plus years.<br /><br />Still, "The Fog" is a good and creepy movie with quite a few eerie scenes. I was very impressed with the acting in this movie. I thought it was really interesting the way Carpenter used so many familiar faces in this movie from the original "Halloween". Jamie Lee Curtis, Nancy Loomis and Charles Cyphers were all in "Halloween". Tom Atkins would also star in "Halloween III" as did Nancy Loomis to the tune of a lesser role. Adrienne Barbeau also starred in several Carpenter movies including "Escape from New York" as did Charles Cyphers to a lesser role. I believe Carpenter and Barbeau would marry as well. Alas, I digress. The point is that there are quite a few familiar faces in this movie from other Carpenter movies, and along with the directing, the acting was very good. The special effects are pretty good for this type of movie, but there is very little blood and gore much to the chagrin of you gorehounds out there.<br /><br />The concept behind "The Fog" is probably the kind of idea that looks great on paper, but is actually very difficult to execute as a convincing horror flick. I have always argued that ghost stories and haunted house movies are the most difficult horror movies to make, and while it does not have to be realistic per se, it does need to be convincing...there is a difference. For the most part, Carpenter was able to pull this off, but toward the end, I think the savvy horror movie viewer can see that the supernatural element to this movie was difficult to develop and remain scary at the same time. In a sense, one has to keep the interest of the viewer without revealing too much at the same time, and that is difficult to do. For all intents and purposes, Carpenter achieves this in "The Fog", but for one reason or another, this movie just is not a classic, probably because of how difficult it is to execute and the limitations of what one can do with a movie like this. In other words, "The Fog" really does not have the potential to be a classic horror movie in the true sense of the term.<br /><br />In conclusion, "The Fog" is an entertaining and creepy horror movie that is good for rainy Saturday nights, preferably late because I think one is better able to identify with and relate to the spirit of the movie under the right circumstances. In wrapping this review up, I should point out that the remake of "The Fog" was an absolute disaster, so I would advise you not to waste your time or money there.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8.html">A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8</a><br/><p>I can't imagine... how could have I not watched this movie as a kid?

A town is haunted by<br />a mysterious fog with vengeful ghosts on it's 100th anniversary. This<br />is a great ghost story that's one of Carpenter's best. This dvd has<br />nice picture and sound plus cool extras. I highly recommend this<br />Carpenter horror classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A34HYQ9BQZPE78.html">A34HYQ9BQZPE78</a><br/><p>Being yet another movie that comes from The Golden Era of Horror Films, "The Fog" contains all the elements that make up a classic horror movie. It's got a great and chilling atmosphere with the mysterious fog that rolls in and out, a really cool setting with the city on the bay, great monsters that are in this case, the ghosts of the sailors, and there's even some good gore shots throughout.<br /><br />Although the pace of this movie is not the fastest in a horror film, I think it's suitable to the overall atmosphere of the movie, which for the most part, is dark and surreal, the sort of tone that's set on a movie you'd watch on a stormy Friday night. By the time the movie climaxes at the end, you'll definitely feel the impact and the wait will indeed be worth it. The ending, however, is the most likely part of the movie that will be the most debatable among horror fans. I personally felt that, for the most part, it was satisfying, although it the tone of the ending was a little awkward, almost as though the writers were preparing a sequel.<br /><br />With all said and done, "The Fog" is a classic, atmospheric horror movie and is highly recommended to fans seeking such a film. An ideal movie for Halloween time, be sure to pick it up in time for the 31st! Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>After "Halloween" became the biggest independent thriller of all-time in 1978, producers John Carpenter and Debra Hill set out to see if lightning could strike twice with "The Fog". Hitting theatres in 1979, the film wasn't as big a hit as its predecessor, but nevertheless "The Fog" has lived on as being one of the scariest films of the 1970's. "The Fog" is about a seaside town called Antonio Bay that is blanketed by a huge fogbank one cool summer night. People are murdered and all hell breaks loose as this small coastal town tries to survive the evil that lurks around them. Jamie Lee Curtis, who starred in "Halloween", also stars in this blockbuster, along with her mother, one of the screen's greatest stars Janet Leigh. Adrienne Barbeau, who became a TV star in "Maude", also stars as a disc jockey working in a lighthouse who witnesses the fog descending on the town and its inhabitants. The film is really scary, not in the sense that its filled with a lot of gore, but in the fact that not knowing what is in the fog makes things that more terrifying.<br /> This DVD contains a ton of bonuses, including a documentary on the film with its stars, outtakes, audio commentary by the producers, and much more.<br /> "Newsweek" calls the film "crisply chilling" and "The Film Journal" says, "The Fog" is "a tale of nocturnal terror".<br /> Columbia released a remake of "The Fog" in 2006, and it is a great film worth of owning.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>John Carpenter directed this scary tale about some ghosts coming back to a town by the sea called Antonio Bay 100 years later. The town are saluting to the 4 founders of the town. Little do they know, the founders are murderers of the ghosts coming back. Carpenter uses a lot of actors from HALLOWEEN such as Jamie Lee Curtis, Nancy Loomis, and Charles Cyphers. Tom Atkins plays Nick Castle. There is a real Nick Castle and he played Michael Myers in the original HALLOWEEN Tom Atkins played in HALLOWEEN III: Season of the Witch. The Fog also has Janet Leigh who was in Hitchcock's classic masterpeice; Psycho If you are a fan of horror, or John Carpenter's movies; you'll love THE FOG!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>I've never seen The Fog except in snippets on television.  My wife, on the other hand, saw it at a Girl Scout movie night, which is either a cruel trick or a hilarious joke, depending on you perspective.  Certainly, the movie scared the heck out of the poor girls watching it and my wife remembers it vividly.<br /><br />Anyway, this gave the movie something of a reputation at our house that made it required viewing.  With the release of the awful remake, I decided it was time for me to bone up on a little chunk of cinema history by John Carpenter, master of action horror.<br /><br />The movie is essentially a ghost story: settlers of a coastal town led a ship full of lepers to their deaths, stole their gold, and went on to prosper.  On the eve of the hundred-year celebration, six souls will be claimed in vengeance.<br /><br />There are several protagonists in this film: Stevie Wayne (the smoky-voiced Adrienne Barbeau) the radio DJ, Kathy Williams (Janet Leigh) as the mayor, Elizabeth Solley (Jamie Lee Curtis) the loose hitchhiker, and Father Malone (Hal Holbrook) as the boozy priest. Malone discovers a diary that details the pending doom about to befall the town. Wayne, who runs her radio station from a lighthouse, is uniquely positioned to use the power of 80s technology to track the fog.  Williams frets over the loss of her husband at sea and bravely leads the candlelight vigil on the eve of the ceremony despite the town losing power.  And finally Solley...well Solley sleeps around and gets scared a lot.<br /><br />The Fog is hardly perfect.  It's obvious Curtis' character exists as a box office draw.  She has nothing to do but tag along.  There's at least one scene where the fog looks like a kid's chalk drawing being dragged across a piece of celluloid.  And viewed abstractly, there's something hilarious about zombies dressed in pirate garb who are polite enough to knock on the door rather than breaking into your house with outstretched hands, Romero-style.<br /><br />And yet The Fog is one scary movie.  John Carpenter's score, while reminiscent of Halloween, is scary in its own right. Wayne's helplessness and terror, as she shifts from sultry on-air voice to a mother terrified for her son, is palpable.  And the glowing fog, when the special effects are up to snuff, is truly terrifying.  Carpenter knows when to show his zombies and when not to show them, and it's a credit to his nascent (at the time) moviemaking skills that even when the zombies show up, they're scary enough that the glowing red eyes of the lead zombie burn in your memory long after the movie has faded.<br /><br />There are also a variety of nods to Lovecraft throughout the film, including Machen, Whateley, and Arkham, which just goes to show that Carpenter actually knew his horror roots.  The special features are illuminating as well, explaining the moviemaking process Carpenter went through as well as the reshoots.  I'm pleased to report the movie is better for it.<br /><br />Years later, when my wife saw this movie, she was still creeped out by it.  But she's comforted by the knowledge that when the zombies come in the fog...at least they'll knock first.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>i have to say the fog is another of john carpenters good pieces of work. i kind of new is was going to be good, just cause of that, and he pulled it off. i have to admit though that this and the remake are on the same level for me. this was creepy, because you never really see those lost souls, and when you do, they're shadows. left to your imagination, which can play all sorts of things. it was good for it's time. it had some crazy slasher stuff in there. when they brought out those knifes and hooks boy did they let you have it. they didn't hold back, and i thought that was way nice. a sinister fog rolls into antonio bay on it's 100th birthday, bringing with it a crew with a thirst for revenge. a crew of people carrying a horrible desease, were lured to their deaths a 100 years ago, by a few men who were controlled by greed and fell back on their word. not only did these men steal their lives, but also their gold. taking everything, from these people who just wanted a little place to call home. the town of antonio bay was witness to a terrible secret. one many thought dead and gone, but on this night, it returns to seek the ones that are to blame. no one can escape the fog, that swallows you before you even know it. could there be an end to it. a life for a life. it's haunting, and in some ways unexpected. it had some of those moments where you kind of jerk a bit, and the ending was unforgettable. the cast was a nice one. tom atkins, good actor. adrienne barbeau, played her part very well. she just fell into character. as for jamie lee curtis, her acting speaks for itself. any role you give her, she'll outdo herself. of course she's a lot better know than she was then, but in this film she still manages to get your attention. good story, good actors, good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>I saw John Carpenter's "The Fog" (1980) years ago and was kind of bored by it. Catching it again recently, however, I was impressed by quite a few things:<br /><br />-- The film has MOOD. Carpenter successfully captured a fitting spooky atmosphere for his ghost story. (The plot involves the horrific ghosts of a ship of lepers returning to enact revenge on a coastal community 100 years after the people of that village guided them to a rocky death in order to swipe their chest of gold).<br /><br />The spooky mood is nicely captured in the very first scene wherein John Houseman shares the ghost story to a group of kids at a campfire on the coast.<br /><br />-- Spectacular locations. The picture was filmed in the beautiful Point Reyers/Bodega Bay region North of San Francisco.<br /><br />-- Fabulous Score. Especially the main piano piece that runs during the end credits. It actually blows away the more popular main score to Capenter's "Halloween."<br /><br />-- Good Cast, which includes Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Hal Holbrook, Nancy Kyes and Janet Leigh.<br /><br />-- An unpredictable finish. I know this is a horror flick and people are supposed to die, but it's nice to see people NOT die for a change. It's refreshing!<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: If you're looking for a fast-paced slasher gore-fest, you will not like this film. If, however, you're in the mood for something spooky, atmospheric and aesthetically pleasing, "The Fog" will likely trip your trigger.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>The fog finally comes to dvd and it's loaded with lots of special features.

There's just something creepy about the film and the natural phenomenon that slinks into Antonio Bay on the eve of its 100 year anniversary, to terrorize citizens with the ghosts of evil deeds past.<br />Jamie Lee Curtis is in the film but she isn't really the star in the sense that she was in Carpenter's "Halloween".  Spoiler - this film doesn't match "Halloween" in terror value so if you've never seen it and think you'll be scared stupid, think again.  Still, "The Fog" remains an unsettling treck into the night where ghosts roam the earth in search of treasure and revenge.  The scene with Mrs. Cobrits and the little boy (if you've seen the film before you know exactly what I'm talking about) still gives me sweaty palms.<br />MGM DVD has remastered the film in 5.1.  Although the anamorphic transfer is a marked improvement over previous issues on laserdisc and VHS there are still a few cases where visual information gets lost in the darkest scenes.  Also, film grain is obtrusive in several scenes.  Color fidelity is dated but nicely rendered.  At its best "The Fog" exhibits sharp images with good definition and color clarity.  At its worst, there's a momentary loss of fine detail and shadow and contrast delineation.  Also includes a documentary and featurette and theatrical trailer.  Overall, great job and well worth the money.  Just make sure you lock your doors and windows before you watch it.</p></br></body></html>

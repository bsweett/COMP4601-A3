Anyway if you're familiar with the Michael Caine original than you'll even enjoy this revisionist remake of the '70s film. Wahlberg makes a fine hero, Theron is nice to look at and Edward Norton is a lot of fun as the villain you'd love to hate.  If you liked "Oceans 11" then you'll enjoy this.  I've knocked one star for the video quality of this in HD but the price of this in HD DVD versus the Blu-ray is so obscenely low that it definitely ranks as a best buy.  Like would you pay $5 or $6 for this disc in HD or close to $20 in Blu-ray--go figure.  Anyway if you like Wahlberg also check out in HD DVD, "Four Brothers" and "Shooter" all at a bargain basement price in HD DVD!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Wooden performances by the protagonist Wahlberg and antagonist Norton (who by his own admission had no interest in doing the film) overcome a sometimes clever updating of 1969's The Italian Job; it's a fun enough watch but not a memorable film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>The Italian Job was the thrid best movie I saw back in summer 2003. After the below par A Man Apart, F. Gary Gray redeems himself with this slick hesit film. The problem with Gray's last film was the script and given the right material Gray shows his talent as a director , hence his work in his previous films The Negotiator and Set It Off. The Italian Job sharp and witty written by Donna & Wayne Powers is a huge improvement over the previous film Valentine, the Powers duo get great performances out of everyone in the cast from the star Mark Wahlberg to Franky G. Walhberg and his team which consit of Mos Def, Seth Green and Jason Statham decide to reccuit Charlize Theron to bring the evil Ed Norton. The trailer pretty much gives away the plot of the film so I won't ruin it here but the film is a lot of fun and considering the lack of gun battle violence that's really suprising. Seth Green and Mos Def are real scene stealers as always and Wahlberg has great chemistry with everyone in the cast. My advice go see this movie and just have a good time.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>I wonder how many MINI Cooper automobiles were sold thanks to this movie? It couldn't help but add to the sales of this little car, which is featured in this film, along with an attractive cast.<br /><br />The film doesn't overdo the violence, has a pretty intelligent script (with a few short exceptions). features interesting characters and is nicely firmed. The cat-and-mouse game between Edward Norton and  Charlize Theron's characters is suspenseful and fun to watch.<br /><br />Once again, however, we are manipulated into rooting for criminals portrayed as "the good guys." How many times has this happened since the days of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" in the 1960s?  Yet, it still gets five stars because it is an extremely entertaining movie and it also doesn't overboard on the profanity or sex....and, yes, those little cars are cool. Everyone I've talked to who has seen this film, enjoyed it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>The Italian Job brings to the screen the story of a group of thieves bent on revenge on one of their own who betrayed them by murdering their leader and running off with the gold.<br />Mark Wahlberg, Donald Sunderland, Edward Norton, Charlize Theron, Seth Green, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are commendable to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills, not to mention a few laughs.<br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!<br />In short, The Italian Job is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>"The Italian Job" is a fast paced crime thriller is actioned packed with a excellent ensemble, a terrific musical score and some awesome cinematography especially when filmed in Venice and the Italian Alps.  It suffers however from mostly pedestrian acting performances and often uneven plot.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg plays Charlie Croker, the mastermind of a elaborate heist in Venice of $35 million of gold bullion.  His team is bolstered by his mentor and father figure John Bridger, a career thief played by Donald Sutherland.  The brilliantly conceived plan goes off without a hitch however team member Steve played by Edward Norton decides to double cross Wahlberg. He kills Sutherland absconding with the gold and is convinced that he's also terminated the remainder of Wahlberg's crew.<br /><br />The film then turns into a tale of retribution as Wahlberg who does little more than flex and smile recruits Charlize Theron, Sutherland's daughter Stella who is a high tech security expert and safecracker, to join his crew.  Even the talented Norton fails to deliver a notworthy acting performance and computer geek Lyle played by Seth Green steals the show with his performance.<br /><br />The action including an excellent car chase scene featuring a trio of Mini Coopers roaring through gridlocked Los Angeles streets is unrelenting.  The plot suffers from a lack of imagination when the scheme to recover the loot from the villainous Norton utilizes the same mechanism used in the original theft.</p></br><a href="../users/AE4JNORCLW8F6.html">AE4JNORCLW8F6</a><br/><p>I love a movie that you have to watch from beginning to end to fully understand. The Italian Job is that kind of engaging, but action-packed thriller. The cast has an exciting chemistry that keeps things interesting throughout the movie. And, of course, there are the Mini Coopers. Well worth the watch, lovers of an exciting, but intellectually stimulating action thriller will love this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A29SJTG21BVWF4.html">A29SJTG21BVWF4</a><br/><p>With the thought that most remakes are terrible peices of trash that shouldn't of been made in the first place.  I was pleasantly surprised with this remake of "The Italian Job".  You get time to know a little about the character but doesn't hesitate to give the action and comedy quickly.  Good acting all around.  This movie is a good rental for the occasional watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A39NS429FYXAD1.html">A39NS429FYXAD1</a><br/><p>Extremely well done heist/buddy flick in the vein of, but not as good as THE BOURNE and OCEANS series.  This could be due to the casting.  Mark Wahlberg, who showed such promise in BOOGIE NIGHTS, is unfortunately best suited to beefcake roles.  The uber talented Edward Norton seems woefully unhappy to be in this one (nor does he appear in any of the press materials recut into "special features") and phones in his most disappointing performance as the turncoat bad guy.  Donald Sutherland pops up to compete with Michael Caine and Charles Durning for the most over-used "icon" of his generation.  Charlize Theron & Seth Green, however, bring surplus talent and humor to their roles and manage to keep the iffy-ensemble together.  Thank goodness for the stunt work and locations (especially evidenced when you see the ghastly and gratefully deleted scenes)!<br /><br />The music, too, is especially noteworthy and adds greatly to the excitement of this "summer" movie.<br /><br />The special features are negligible and only reinforce the stereotype that it's best not to let the actors speak anything other than their scripted lines.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Thieves robbing thugs robbing crooks robbing etc. A first robbery and then a member of this first  team robs his team and then the victims of this fink recuperate their gold from him in a spectacular third robbery. From Venice to Los Angeles, from gondolas to cars, from canals to overstuffed streets, etc. The interest is not so much in the action which is simple and well dynamized by a good rhythm. Not so much in the plot and the suspense because we all know from the very start that justice will prevail, I mean that the first robbers will recuperate their gold no matter what. The interest of the film is in the details of the action. It all revolves around the use of hightechnology in city managing (here the traffic and the subway) and in security systems (here safes and the tools to break them without explosives). But once again this does not create any suspense because we know this hightechnology will not fail, except on order and command. The second interest is in the characters. They are simple and their psychologies are also very simple, but less simple than we could have feared. Hence they have some simple depth nearly like real human beings. A father who is absent, a father figure who is looming high and a man who comes into the slot and becomes the absent father who is no father any more but just a plain and desired male lover. This needs two rather good actors to imply and impersonate this situation in simple face expression and body language. The camera does the rest. In other words a good entertaining experience. By the way the fink looks like a fink from the very start : the way he walks, the way he smiles without smiling, etc. But why on earth was he given a slightly mexican or at least latin american look ?<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron continue to cement themselves as great modern film stars in &quot;The Italian Job,&quot; and are ably supported by a quality cast -- including Seth Green's best non-Buffy role to date -- in this remake.<p>Like all great caper flicks, the film puts an emphasis on cleverness, and the tricks and twists are all top-notch, with even the signature use of the new Mini Coopers being both incredibly plausible and, yes, very clever. When things go wrong, they go wrong because of human fallibility and bad luck, instead of cumbersome and artifical plot complications.<p>With the surprising exception of Donald Sutherland, the cast all are at the top of their respective games in this, and ego-driven scenery chewing is almost entirely absent, and even the hints of romance are nicely underplayed, taking a logical second place to the revenge-driven caper itself.<p>The film rates only 4 stars due to direction that sometimes fails to keep the film as tense and taught as it perhaps ought to, but it still ranks as one of the smartest and most charming action/adventure movies in years.<p>Strongly recommended for fans of &quot;The Sting,&quot; &quot;Ocean's 11&quot; and fans of Seth Green.</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>This is a truly terrific caper movie, one that works well by both showcasing the emerging star power of both Donnie Wahlberg and Charlize Theron and also having a terrific storyline. It is also a smart and well-photographed movie that proves the old adage of depending on the use of a great story and then embellishing on it with all the bells and whistles. The plot is as believable as anything can be that posits the existence of people so smart, so devious, and so daring as to be able to do some of the things that are done here. Yet the qualms about believability quickly fade with each nosiy and exciting revving up of the action, which is well choreographed, full of pyrotechnics, and absolutely fresh and new, adding to the charm of the movie. <p>The cast adds immeasurably to the charm of the movie, with Donald Sutherland, Ed Norton, and several notable others lending both credence and a certain gritty feel to this tale about life on the margins, on the far side of the law. I also got the impression that given the box office success of this film; much of the crew may be back to thrill us again in an inevitable sequel. I am up for it. After all, given the aplomb and cool they displayed in driving a trio of Metros through the streets, sewers, and tunnels of Los Angeles at rush hour, and added into this mix was a certain level of style and intelligence often missing in such caper flicks, it would be fun to consider a series of such films. Compared to other recent offerings at the theater, which have by an dlarge been disappointing affairs indeed, it would be a relief to consider more caper flicks like this. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z28WKY1LHBKY.html">A2Z28WKY1LHBKY</a><br/><p>Very realistic caper; everything is highly probable and believable, and it's very likely real thieves are studying it carefully for professional tips, just like they did "Rififi". There's a few things I didn't quite understand --- like why didn't Spiderman get any billing, and why was his costume so loose-fitting and badly made?  I'm sure his role was significant, but you'll have to look hard, or you might just miss it. Luckily we've got dvd replay facilities these days: check out The Moment of Truth. And what's this place called OHLLYWODO? And then, obviously, what about that golfer? A guy with that handicap I'd like on my team.<br /><br />WILL SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHAT SPIDERMAN IS DOING IN THIS MOVIE?<br /><br />Well, come on people! Hasn't anyone else noticed Spiderman yet? He's there, in the street, for about three frames. Stop the action at the Moment of Truth. This is a great opportunity to make constructive use of that "Comment" box --- so far the only comments on my reviews that I've seen are completely stupid.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>The Italian Job (F. Gary Gray, 2004)<br /><br />Gray (The Negotiator) once again takes a top-notch cast and does something good with them. Not great, mind you, but good. But then, how bad can a movie be when your cast list includes Edward Norton, Charlize Theron, Donald Sutherland, Mark Wahlberg, Seth Green, Jason Statham, Mos Def, Franky G, and two members of the Boo Yaa T.R.I.B.E.?<br /><br />Very loosely based on the 1969 film of the same name (the writers of the new script watched the original only once before writing, in order to not be overly influenced by the original), The Italian Job opens with John Bridger (Sutherland) and hs crew of professional thieves doing a hefty job in Venice, making off with a fortune in distinctive gold bars. Without revealing any spoilers, after the heist, one of the group turns on the rest, and the remainder of the film is about the rest of the group's attempt to get the spiols from the job back. As that small synopsis should tell you, this is an action movie, and it's pretty much neverending action (much like Gray's last feature before this, A Man Apart). There's not much original here, and you'll see the movie's twists coming long before its actors, but lots of stuff blows up, the actors all play their roles to the hilt, and there are a lot of one-liners to throw around at work the next day. A good turn-your-brain-off kind of movie. ***</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3SXHT6RBV81.html">A2F3SXHT6RBV81</a><br/><p>Even though this movie starts out in Venice, with motorboat chases down the canals following an ultra modern heist of gold bars worth 35 million dollars, most of the action takes place out in California.  There really is not much Italian about this job; even the funky music is pure L.A. -- not easy on the ears or senses.  It is pretty weird with lots of noise but not much taste.<br /><br />The dialogue isn't much, either.  Seth Green of WITHOUT A PADDLE fame was the best of the bunch, as the computer wiz Napster.  He looks so much like Michael Feinstein, it is a joy to watch his antics.  They use cell phones and computers which I know were not in the original 1969 version starring Michael Caine who was the original 'Alfie.'<br /><br />The weird looking cars (mini Coopers) red, white and blue were something like the teen races in 'Rebel Without A Cause' and 'Grease.'  They maneuvered down on the Metro underground tracks and through storm drain tunnels to escape the black helicopter after a fashion.<br /><br />We see the famous junkyard run by the Italians where the garbage men are warned by a 400-lb. Oriental or Ukranian (take your pick).  The first attempt to recover the gold which is left -- 208 bricks worth 27 million had to be aborted because of a neighbor's large party in the gated and guarded grand mansions.<br /><br />There was nothing poetic about this bunch of international criminals.  The helicopter flew right past the Hollywood hill sign, Hotel Roosevelt, and Chinese Theatre.  The traffic jams caused by a malfunction at the Traffic Control Center showed some buses; #2636 looked like the old white borrowed vehicles KAT has from Worchester, Mass.  The mini cars are driven into a cattle car attached to the Union Pacific train and off they go into the wild blue yonder.<br /><br />It could have been a western except for the Big Brother cameras out on the freeway.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>This is a movie plenty of action. The script runs about an old thief who decides make the las robery. Thirty five millions in gold is a great temptation . But suddenly there will be a twist of fate.<br />Wonderful locations and excellent special effects. Shuterland as always, steals the show. Walberg is OK and the cosmic beauty of Charlize Theron plays a convincing role.<br />There are many hair raising sequences.<br />A good entertainment but without the punch of the previous version from the sixties.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Most of THE ITALIAN JOB is set in Los Angeles, but that's okay as the script coyly uses the heist in Italy as its model in LA.  Mark Wahlberg stars as Charlie, a likeable thief (if there are such things?), who vows revenge after his compatriate, played with villainess glory by Edward Norton, undermines the Italian job, steals the gold and also kills Charlie's mentor and surrogate father, nicely played by Donald Sutherland.  With that being the main plot, director F. Gary Gray wisely focuses on the heist and the chase scenes, minis in glory, are beautifully executed.  Wahlberg has that stoic manliness we used to get from guys like Mitchum and Widmark; Charlize Theron as Sutherland's beautiful daughter, does nicely; Jason Statham, Seth Green and Mos Def are perfect members of Wahlberg's gang.  The flashbacks where Wahlberg explains how they all got into crime are hilarious.  Crisp editing, a marvelous score by John Powell and beautiful locales help add to the pluses of this well done thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>I've just gotten around to seeing this movie on dvd and I'm glad I did.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I haven't see the original film but I certainly found this remake a thrill ride and felt the actors did a good job with their roles.  Mark Wahlberg is good as the ring leader, Charlie, and Charlize Theron, the lovely Oscar winning actress makes a tantalizing partner for the team as Stella, a whiz at opening almost any safe.  Edward Norton is very good as the sleezy, one-time friend turned villain, who becomes the target of Charlie and Co after a major betrayal. <p>Other cast members include Seth Green, as a computer geek nicknamed &quot;Napster&quot; and Donald Sutherland as Stella's father, once the leader of this team of charming thieves. This is a good action film and worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>After that dreadful remake called (For"Get Carter"), another Michael Caine film is brought from the vault.  Mr. Caine himself in one interview made it clear that he is very proud of the original film made in 1969, and I am sure he will not be so sad after watching this slickly done remake.<p>The new story itself is loosely connected with the original, so let's stop saying 'remake? not again' and see this one as a well-crafted heist movie.  The premise is surprisingly simple.  One heist in Venice leads to double-crossing, and after one year the betrayed thieves get a chance for revenge in Los Angels.  The film features gripping sequences of stealing a big heavy safe, wild motor-boat ride (that must have scared the people in Venice) and car chase of three Mini-Coopers, which literally steals the show with very useful agility.<p>Actors are all good, but all typecast, so you can tell who is the traitor or who got killed while watching the opening credits.  Two names might attract you such as Mark Wahlberg as Charlie, nominal leader of the group, and Charlize Theron as Stella who decides to break the law for her personal reasons, but it is supporting actors like computer-wizard Seth Green or Jason 'Handson Rob' Statham that really impress you with unexpectedly comical turns.  You also see Edward Norton, Mos Def, Franky G, and ubiquitous Donald Sutherland.  Michael Caine does not appear himself, probably because of his regret of having done it in "Carter," but it does not mean that he is all gone from the film.  Try to spot 'him.'  <p>The greatest value of the film lies in F. Gary Gray's skillful handling of the characters, and his proficient staging of actions, especially the ones using three Mini-Coopers.  But why Mini-Coopers, you might ask.  Like the original, these characters have to use them in the crutial scenes, so let's not say this is product placement.  Actually, you may say those cars running like daredevil are the true star of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>"The Italian Job" is a remake of a classic, but under F. Gary Gray's direction, is surprisingly crisp and well-paced.  No need to detail the plot--revenge of criminals on one of their own, who stole from them.  <p>The cast is a great ensemble with the only cast members in break out roles, being the 3 Mini-Coopers featured in the film.  No doubt this will be a BMW Sales Bonanza for the cheeky little Brit auto.  Character development is secondary to the heist and the action, as it should be...too little of the film is in Venice and too much in LA, but what can you do?<p>The music is a refreshing mix, there are laughs sprinkled throughout & enough action for all but the youngest adrenaline jockies.  A sappy ending...they should have stuck with pictures of each of the heist members surrounded by their gold, and called it quits.<p>Definitely worth seeing on the big screen, and again in DVD, where it promises to have some great special effects!</p></br><a href="../users/A391YPR0NFTCLK.html">A391YPR0NFTCLK</a><br/><p>This is one cool movie!

To some extent, if you've seen one of these (especially the ur-heist film "Rififi"), you've seen them all.  Hey, if you've ever watched a movie, you know that when a master thief makes "one last score" before retirement, things are going to go horribly wrong.  It's just like being a cop in a movie two weeks before retirement.  "The Italian Job" does not transcend any expectations, but it doesn't fail to meet any of them, either.  The performances are good, and the script makes as much sense as you would expect it to.  The action sequences are well-done, and there are enough car chases to remind you of the Golden Age of car chases in the 70s and early 80s.  In the end, while it is a decent movie, there is really nothing memorable about it, other than the cars.  "The Italian Job" is a decent rental; you will likely not be disappointed, and you may even have a good time with it.  But it's just not distinctive or memorable enough to add to your permanent collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U360OMVQRPUB.html">A1U360OMVQRPUB</a><br/><p>THE ITALIAN JOB is billed as a remake of a popular Michael Caine movie from 1969, but it is so highly inventive in most aspects that it's really more of an original.  The movies still occupies itself with a daring robbery of gold bricks involving managing traffic and the use of mini-Coopers, and some of the characters even have the same names as the first movie.  However, the remake is a definite thriller that is guaranteed to stoke the adrenaline levels of watchers everywhere.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg stars as Charlie Croker.  Donald Sutherland plays John Bridger, his criminal mastermind mentor.  It's this relationship, along with Charlize Theron as his estranged daughter Stella, that really drives the movies.  Edward Norton plays the bad guy, while Jason Statham, Seth Green, Mos Def, and Franky G round out the crew.<br /><br />The movie opens with a fantastic bit that establishes the relationship between Croker and Bridger, then moves smoothly into an action riff that eats up screen footage and shows off Venice and the canals.  After a double-cross in the Swiss Alps, the movie skips ahead a year and introduces us to Stella Bridger.  Stella makes her living as a professional safecracker who uses her powers for good.  Charlie talks to her, telling her they've finally tracked down the man who killed her father, and he offers her a place on the team to get revenge.<br /><br />From that point on, the movie sprints forward into a rapid-fire game of cat and mouse between our heroes and the bad guy.  It plays out like a chess battle, but accelerated to tire-screeching hairpin twists and turns.<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition of the movies is awesome.  The video content is so clear in Venice that you'll swear you're on the canals yourself.  Director F. Gary Gray's pacing and shots are designed to thrill, and they do.  The picture is absolutely stunning.  The audio quality is pretty amazing as well, but the studio opted for the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound effect instead of going all out for uncompressed sound.<br /><br />The bottom line is that you do get a much better picture with the high-def version on a high-def monitor, but the sound could have been better.  You won't be upgrading your sound, but purchasing the disc will definitely upgrade your video presentation.  The special features included on the disc have already been packaged, so they don't add anything new.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>F. Gary Gray's "The Italian Job" (2003) is a glossy, pretty update of an earlier movie.  If "Ocean's Eleven" hadn't been exquisitely remade in 2001 by Steven Soderbergh, George Clooney, and assorted other stars, "The Italian Job" might have been able to stand on its own two feet.  Unfortunately, it looks like a poor knock-off job where Mark Wahlberg unsuccessfully tries to be another Danny Ocean, but lacks the gravitas of either Clooney or the original Ocean, Frank Sinatra.<br /><br />One thing about this movie is undeniable, and that is that it looks great.  From the opening scenes of a clever heist in Venice to a double-cross on a chilly Alpine dam to a car chase through L.A. to the glorious lines of Charlize Theron's face, "The Italian Job" is one of the best-looking crime movies you'll ever see.  Unfortunately, beauty carries a movie only so far - "Under the Tuscan Sun" is another movie that looks uber-gorgeous, but nobody's going to eagerly await the 10th-anniversary edition of that DVD, are they?<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg plays Charlie Croker, who starts the film as the heir apparent to the role of leader of a gang of lovable thieves, now that former leader John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) is stepping down.  Croker leads his team through the successful "Italian job," which is a clever heist involving swiping a huge safe from a Venetian mansion using explosives, scuba gear, and a very fast boat.<br /><br />But in a plot twist that the promotional ads gave away, the Italian Job goes bad when Steve (Ed Norton) double-crosses the team and leaves them for dead, swiping $35 million in gold ingots.  (As an aside, is "Steve" really the name you want for your villain?  If the filmmakers were trying to make a comic point here, perhaps using the blandness of Steve to point out the over-the-top names of many movie villains, they were a bit too subtle.  Instead, "Steve" comes off like a first-draft name that they simply forgot to revisit.)<br /><br />Some time later, Croker and team track down Steve in L.A. and plan for a caper that would both bring back the millions they lost to Steve as well as a certain measure of vengeance.  To do this, they need a safe-cracker, and wouldn't you know it, the late Mr. Bridger left a lovely daughter Stella (the aforementioned Ms. Theron), who is a safe-cracker who works for the police when she isn't racking up speeding tickets.  But where dear old dad "worked by instinct," Stella uses the best in modern technology to get the job done.  With that set-up, would you be surprised if there is a scene where Stella has to abandon her hi-tech gadgetry and crack a safe using nothing but her "instincts"?  If you would be surprised by such a plot development, "The Italian Job" is probably going to be one of your favorite movies.<br /><br />And this is ultimately where "Ocean's Eleven" sinks "The Italian Job."  Both movies cover essentially the same ground (planning an incredibly complex and witty heist), but "Ocean's Eleven" does this so much better.  Both films involve teams of lovable criminals, but while you can't criticize Jason Statham, Mos Def, and Seth Greene of "Italian Job," this ensemble can't hold a candle to "Ocean's Eleven's" "supporting cast" of Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Bernie Mack, Carl Reiner, and others.  I enjoy Ms. Theron's performance much more than Julia Roberts' turn in "Ocean's Eleven," but it must be said that as far as the female leads are concerned, there are no losers here.<br /><br />Both films also spend a lot of time focusing on the intricate planning that goes into a major caper, but again "Ocean's Eleven" has a caper that is rich with surprise, wit, and humor.  The climactic heist in "The Italian Job" builds to, of all things, a car chase.  Sure, it's an amazing car chase, but if your movie is focusing on wit and humor, relying on a car chase to pull off the climax is a signal that the writers have given up.<br /><br />And finally, as much as I enjoy Ed Norton as an actor, you have to admit that his villain, Steve, can't hold a candle to the ominous refinement brought to the screen by Andy Garcia as Terry Benedict in "Ocean's Eleven."  Garcia injects such slick venom into his scenes that otherwise throwaway lines like his "Terry" - "Danny" exchange with Clooney take on a whole new life.  Ed Norton is a wonderful actor, but Steve just ain't that much of a bad guy -- he's so unoriginal that he spends his ill-gotten gains on the prizes that his other fellow criminals planned to purchase.  Translation -- Steve is an empty box, and empty boxes do not great villains make.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm getting long-winded for a three-star review.  I must confess I had high expectations for "The Italian Job."  But at the end of the day, all Wahlberg and crew (with the exception of Charlize Theron) did was make me want to go watch a better crime movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SYMLB8JSW5VD.html">A3SYMLB8JSW5VD</a><br/><p>Although it bares little resemblance to the original. This was a masterpiece. It has all the makings of what a good movie should be. Great directing,excellent cast,terrific plot. And the wonderful car chase scenes. I haven't seen a movie this good since the remake of Ocean's Eleven. Add this to your DVD library.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ.html">A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ</a><br/><p><p>I'm normally not a fan of action-type movies, but the Italian Job is really well-made and has a great plot (note: I have not seen the original). The actual &quot;Italian Job&quot; is a gold robbery pulled off in Venice, Italy. But it is discovered one of the team is a selfish traitor. He takes everyone else's share of the loot, kills the safecracker leader of the gang and leaves the rest for dead, but they methodically plot revenge to get their gold back - adding the 'legit' safecracker daughter of the assassinated safecracker to the team. There are plenty of plot twists, one involving the Russian mob. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron have wonderful chemistry and Edward Norton is perfectly cocky. Seth Green is also funny as the computer hacker (again - first was Enemy of the State). The Mini Cooper chase alone is worth renting this movie - it is awesome!</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>...I'm not much of a fan of Hollywood formula action flicks, but this one had many more redeeming features than most:<p>1.  A True Babe---in Charlize Theron, who is not only blonde but actually beautiful in a unique way (most Hollywood blondes are blandly homogenous) and can actually act.  Marvelous eye candy.<p>2.  Somewhat interesting characters---the computer nerd is pretty stock, but the others are somewhat original, esp. Handsome Rob, who's just hilarious.<p>3.  Somewhat original action scenes---how they dislodge the safe in Venice, and then the armored car in L.A., was rather neat.  <p>4.  Unusual choice of Cool Car---I'd expect Porsches, BMWs, Ferraris...but never the Mini-Cooper, which looks the Communist-era East German Trabant, a little box on wheels.  <p>5.  Competent dialogue---most action flicks are full of clunky, hackneyed lines that just make you feel sorry for the poor actors who have to deliver them with a straight face.  This screenplay in contrast seems to have been written by actual junior high school graduates.<p>Now my dislikes:<p>1.  Plot gets more than a little unbelievable towards the end---namely, why didn't our heroes just as easily wack Edward Norton's character themselves at the end, instead of paying off the Russian mob a huge chunk of loot to do it for them?  <p>2.  Why does Charlize Theron get to keep her clothes on in this movie?  What a crying shame, especially considering she didn't in &quot;Cider House Rules&quot; which was geared to far less of a predominantly male audience.  Wait...could it be the PG-13 rating, which would allow in a lot more prepubescent moviegoers?<p>3.  Cheesy product placement.  C'mon, a world-class professional hacker typing away at a DELL laptop for Pete's sake???  Yeah, right!</p></br><a href="../users/A109LWN9DUGPDP.html">A109LWN9DUGPDP</a><br/><p>I've already given this movie a 4 star rating with the regular DVD review so the 3 star is for the blu-ray transfer.This is probly the worst movie I've seen on blu-ray so far that was made in the past 10 years.The video is only slightly,slightly better than DVD and thats just becouse the colors are a tad bit more vibrant.The sound is standard 5.1,no uncompressed or TruHD.Maybe if this is the first time your buying this movie get the blu-ray but if you have the DVD I would suggest stay with that.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>&quot;The Italian Job&quot; is a good, fun and intelligent &quot;heist&quot; type movie predicated on the revenge factor.  I found this movie to be quite entertaining from the opening scene all the way to the closing scene which is a bit unusual for these types of movies.<p>Mark Wahlberg has certainly come into his own as a superstar and he quite well proves it with his performance in this movie.  The ever beautiful and alluring Charlize Theron stars and performs quite admirably in this movie.  The supporting cast of Edward Norton, Seth Green, Jason Statham, Mos Def, Franky G and a brief but poignant performance by Donald Sutherland all of which deserve high praise for their collective performances which combined, all bring this movie to a new height.<p>Director, F. Gary Gray also deserves praise for bringing this great heist/caper movie to fruition and putting together such a wonderful cast.  The score for this film perfectly enhances the overall feel of the movie.<p>The Premise:<p>Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) has planned the perfect heist and carried it out perfectly with his crew as they go to Italy to steal millions of dollars worth of gold bricks.  The one thing he didn't plan for was being double crossed by a member of his crew, Steve (Edward Norton).  As part of his plan in double crossing Charlie and the rest of the crew, Steve kills Charlie's mentor and Stella's (Charlize Theron) father, John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), but fails to kill Charlie and the rest of the crew as he thought he did.<p>What follows from there is a very intelligently written and played out heist/caper movie as Charlie finds Steve once again and enlists the aid of Stella in regaining the gold that they'd stolen.<p>I highly recommend this movie as it is one of the better and most enjoyable movies of its type.  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>-Pedal to the Metal:  The Making of &quot;The Italian Job&quot;<br />-Putting the Words on the Page for &quot;The Italian Job&quot;<br />-&quot;The Italian Job&quot; - Driving School<br />-The Mighty Minis of &quot;The Italian Job&quot;<br />-High Octane:  Stunts From &quot;The Italian Job&quot;<br />-6 Deleted Scenes<br />-Theatrical Trailer</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>This film is an infantile knockoff of the 30+ year-old original, a weak Ocean's 11 version. Its main purpose is to serve as a nearly 2-hour commercial for Mini-Coopers. Key words - double-cross, revenge, unbelievable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P98DMX8YUSNW.html">A1P98DMX8YUSNW</a><br/><p>I'm sure that the MiniCooper car company had to pay a lot for the product placement here since it's then-new Minis are the real stars of this 2003 remake of a 1966 Michael Caine heist flick. The plot is some nonsense about $37 million worth of gold bars changing hands back and forth among criminals. The scenes of both a safe and then an armored car dropping through buildings and roadways are somewhat original, so I will give the filmmakers that. I haven't seen the original, so I don't know what they did in 66. Beware that most of the final third of the movie is really just a chase and it does grow tedious at times. There's not much depth to this, but you might like it if you enjoy heist movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AUOVXPT5MYX4.html">A1AUOVXPT5MYX4</a><br/><p>When I first heard of this remake, I was sure it was going to be awful, and that it would never live up to the Michael Caine original. As it happens, there's not much living up to do, since it bears so little resemblance to the original that directly comparing the two would make no sense. There are one or two points which can be compared (and I will get to them), but other than that, this film can quite easily be considered by itself.<br /><br />The first comparable point (which is quite minor, really), is the characters. Yes, Mr. Bridger and Charlie Croker have the same names as the original characters, but that is where their similarities end. Please, if you're doing a film with the same title and same character names, make the characters at least similar. The bulk of the film is very enjoyable- a heist is pulled off rather successfully, one partner double crosses the others, and things kick off when the cheated partners go out for revenge. It has casing jobs, safe-cracking, breaking in and a couple of great getaways- all the ingredients of a good heist film.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it has one thing that heist movies do not need- emotional ties. What is it with Hollywood these days that means that every film needs to have some kind of personal reason for things happening? Why couldn't they just make a heist film about a group of thieves trying to steal gold because it's there, rather than because it was taken by someone who killed your dad / friend / brother / favorite poodle? So... the ties are set up, the heist is planned and pulled off, and they make their getaway. This is where the second comparison comes in. The original film featured a very long race through underground shopping centers, down church steps, over roofs, all to avoid a traffic jam. Whilst this new film features cars racing down steps, and through tunnels, it's very obviously a case of "fans will expect this, so we'll put it in", as there's very little of it, and it does to some extent seem tacked on.<br /><br />Admittedly, this section of the film did please me a little bit, in that Croker says "let's do it like The Italian Job". Although his reference to the characters is referring to the job pulled in the film's opening, it also seemed to be a nod to the original as this section did bear the most similarity to its namesake. Overall, I quite liked The Italian Job. It did have some flaws, but then it had some great moments. I found it very enjoyable to watch, and would advise others to see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2N69DJM8NVYZ6.html">A2N69DJM8NVYZ6</a><br/><p>The acting is very good in this movie as the actors are very good in their parts. Edward Norton does a great job as he plays a sleazy traitor who kills several people. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron do equally great jobs in their roles as they are very emotional and do a very convincing job. The rest of the supporting actors do a great job as thieves who all have their own personality. The short performance by Donald Sutherland was very good and believable.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>THE ITALIAN JOB  has style and a grand sense of speed and action in one of the better caper films of recent years.  Where other heist-based films push the button for unremitting tension, THE ITALIAN JOB combines sleekly written dialogue and character interaction which makes all of the tension scenes (and there are plenty) all the more credible.  The photography of the inevitable car chases and 'inside shots' of the capers is terrific, with the scenes set in Venice, Italy among the best.  The cast is electrically charged without that all too familiar over-the-top push.  Donald Sutherland and Charlize Theron (father/daughter team) are superb, and Mark Wahlberg, Jason Statham, Seth Green, Mos Def, and Franky G establish a comraderie that is destined to overcome their betraying partner Edward Norton.  With a cast like this you almost don't need a script, but the writing has a fine balance of bite and wit.  For sheer explosive entertainment by a crew of winners this movie is among the best in this genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>The film stars Mark Walhberg, who really can't act.  That doesn't matter though because the part didn't call for a great performance.  Ditto for Charlize Theron.  Her acting doesn't matter either because she's so attractive that all she has to do is appear in a scene and all eyes will be on her.  Then there is Donald Sutherland, who does a good job in the role of her aging ex-con father who has taught her everything she needs to know about safecracking. But my very favorite actor in this film was Seth Green who is cast as a computer hacker who winds up controlling traffic jams in Los Angeles.<p>There's murder, of course.  And lots of chase scenes.  One is on the canals of Venice and involves speed boats and gondolas.  The car chases are really good too.  In one scene the cars drive down the stairs and on to the tracks of the Los Angeles subway. Best of all is the plot.  It moves so fast and held my attention so much that I didn't have time to think about how impossible it was.  And of course I was rooting for the thieves.  Isn't that what a caper film is all about?<p>I realize that this film certainly wasn't real and most of the acting was mediocre. But I can't help it. I loved it. It was two hours of pure relaxation.  And I highly recommend it as a truly fine escape film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>This is one of those movies I like while watching it, but soon after forget the plot.  It has a great cast, lots of action, but leaves me feeling a bit empty afterward.  So for me this is a rental and will not be added to my collection.  The picture quality is decent, but I'm not sure I would replace the SD DVD with the HD version (if I owned it.)<br /><br />The whole Blu-Ray vs. HD DVD argument is getting a bit tedious, but I'll weigh in.  I've owned my Toshiba HD DVD player since launch day and I've enjoyed it.  I was originally going to wait until a format "won", but the release of Serenity pushed me off the fence.  If HD DVD dies, I'll still have a collection of dozens or hundreds of movies to watch-much like I did with laserdisc after DVD killed it.<br /><br />Right now, Blu-Ray only has single layer 25 GB discs and Sony is using the inefficient MPEG-2 codec (compared to Microsoft's VC1 used in nearly all HD DVD titles).  This has resulted in a poorer picture and fewer extras.  Dual layer discs are on the way, but studios may not use them (they may be too expensive in the near term.) Also, the studios could switch to VC1, but again that is up to them.  While the picture quality on even the best HD DVDs is excellent, most will not notice the improvement over standard DVD unless they view both side-by-side.  This makes an HD DVD player purchase difficult to justify.  The lower picture quality of Blu-Ray, combined with the much higher player price is even harder to justify and will keep me from getting Blu-Ray until it can at least match HD DVD's quality.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>You know those films that you know are technically `bad' but that fill you with such giddy excitement you can't help but totally love them?  This is one of those films for me.  The plot is nothing short of ridiculous, completely unrealistic and none-to original, but I still can't help but totally adore this movie.  It is fun and exciting and intense, regardless of the predictability of it all.<br /><br />I haven't seen the original (staring the BRILLIANT Michael Caine) but I really should!<br /><br />The film revolves around a group of professional thieves who join forces with the daughter of a respected partner who was murdered and robbed by someone they trusted.  What follows is a slew of preposterous yet highly entertaining sequences of tricks, gadgets and slowly boiling sensual chemistry (Marky Mark and Charlize make a beautiful pair, don't you think?).<br /><br />Wahlberg is a reliable leading man.  He isn't doused with talent like some other actors his age, but he has a likable charm (that whole Brooklyn attitude sits well on him) and he knows how to work a scene.  Charlize Theron has talent (thus the Oscar) but she doesn't really use it in fluff films like this.  She doesn't elevate any of her scenes, but she is gorgeous, which is all this role really required of her.  Edward Norton is the most talented actor here (well, one could debate between him and Sutherland, but la'Donald isn't in more than five minutes of this) and he shows it by oozing a sensual creepiness that makes his irresistible and completely commanding.  That dinner confrontation scene alone is just jaw dropping intensity wrapped up in a dapper little package.<br /><br />The rest of the cast does their job.  Jason Statham is brooding and buff and a total lady killer; Seth Green is comic relief of the nerdy kind; Mos Def is quiet, charming and totally likable.  They work very well.<br /><br />The film is chuck-full of brilliantly paced chase scenes (those ugly little cars have never been so cool), beautifully choreographed action sequences (not to mention beautifully photographed landscapes) and clever tricks that gloss over the plot holes nicely.  With enough going for it to outweigh to stuff working against it, `The Italian Job' is one of those `bad' movies I can totally stand behind.<br /><br />It makes me smile.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>Resurrect the plot of a 1969 Michael Caine movie, recast it with a collection of sharp young actors, and move the action to Los Angeles.  The result is 2003's "The Italian Job", a fast-paced and enjoyable action thriller.<br /><br />The movie opens with an elaborately-planned heist in Venice, Italy.  A crack crew of thieves goes to Mission: Impossible-like lengths to extract a fortune in gold from a canal-side mansion and escape to the Italian Alps.  There, one of the crew (Edward Norton as a slick and selfish bad guy) betrays the rest, killing the aging master thief (cameo by Donald Sutherland), stealing the gold, and scattering the crew.<br /><br />Fast forward a year.  Charlie Croker, the master thief's protege (played with cool precision by Mark Wahlberg), locates the traitor, living in a fortress mansion in Los Angeles.  He reassembles the team to steal the gold back.  This effort is the heart of the film, as Charlie's team plots their entrance into the mansion and their escape afterward.  The highlight of the movie is a nail-biting chase across Los Angeles, with Charlie's team in specially modified Mini-Coopers and their former teammate in hot pursuit by helicopter.  A tense final confrontation at the Los Angeles train station reveals a few final plot twists.<br /><br />Charlize Theron does an excellent turn as Croker's safe-cracking love interest.  Seth Green is the team's computer whiz and comic relief.  Jason Statham is the team's hunky automotive expert. Mos Def and Franky G have nice supporting roles as additional muscle recruited for the Los Angeles job.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as an entertaining action thriller.  This DVD version includes some nice extras on the making of the movie, to include how the amazing Mini-Cooper stunts were performed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>I live right around the corner from a Mini Coop dealership and I'm an Italian-American, so I thought it fitting that I finally rented this movie.  It's a remake of the 1969 original starring Michael Caine.  Whereas that film took place in Italy, the remake stays there only for the introduction and then swiftly moves to California.<br /><br />I love heist films.  Like Ocean's Eleven or Heat, it's all about the cast.  You can see a pattern in the characters:<br /><br />THE WHEELMAN: This is the guy who mans the getaway vehicle, be it helicopter, jet, or car.  Handsome Rob (Jason Statham, my favorite action hero) plays a decidedly scrappy, suave wheelman.  This also happens to be almost the exact character from The Transporter.  Hopefully, Statham will move beyond this type of character, but it's a testament to action tropes that he can actually be typecast as "the wheelman."<br /><br />THE TECH: This guy is almost always a nerd and usually the comic relief.  Lyle (Seth Green) nails this role and actually steals the show with his jokes.  One ad-libbed sequence of Lyle mocking Handsome Rob is the funniest part of the movie.  Of course, the challenge with this sort of character is that he needs to be able to pull off seemingly magical feats of technological wizardry without overshadowing the expertise involved.  When Lyle manages to take control of the entire traffic system, you really have to wonder if he couldn't be better off striking out on his own.  He's almost too good for the movie.<br /><br />THE DEMOLITIONIST: The demolitionist's job is to blow things up.  Sometimes he's a homicidal maniac, other times he's cool and collected.  Left Ear (Mos Def) is a cool customer. And he doesn't like dogs. He gives Lyle competition for the funniest line in the movie:<br /><br />Left Ear: This dude got dogs. I don't do dogs... I had a real bad experience, man.<br /><br />Charlie Croker: What happened?<br /><br />Left Ear: I had. A bad. Experience.<br /><br />THE OLD MAN: You've seen this guy before.  He's probably the former leader of the group.  He's seen too much, been around the block too many times, and he knows his days are numbered.  He just wants one last, big heist so he can retire forever.  He almost always dies in the film.  That pretty much sums up John Bridger (Donald Sutherland).<br /><br />THE HOT CHICK: A recent invention, the hot chick's purpose is to keep men interested.  She can have a variety of roles (tech, wheel-err-woman, demolitionist).  Sometimes she has her own unique set of skills as safecracker.  That's John's daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron), who competes admirably in the sea of testosterone.<br /><br />THE LEADER: Handsome, smart, a safecracker himself, this guy is the one who pulls off a sneaky job right under the bad guys' noses. Unfortunately, Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) is more narrator than anything else.  He seems to have very little to do, and that's a shame, because Wahlberg's talented enough to do much more.<br /><br />The villain is Steve (Edward Norton) a thief turned bad. He knows all of our protagonists' tricks, so he knows how to counter them.  And since he stole the gold from the original Italian Job, he's the perfect foil.  Norton plays him with just the right amount of shifty-eyed sleaze.<br /><br />The Italian Job has lots of cool car chases, lots of near misses, and a lot of twists and turns (literally and figuratively) that make it a brisk, entertaining movie.  You get quickly caught up in the machinations of the characters, which allows the film to get away with a lot of unbelievable nonsense.  But who cares? From the funky flashbacks to the quippy asides, it's clear that Italian Job doesn't take itself too seriously.<br /><br />Although it's more Job than Italian, the Italian Job is still a fun ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>The Italian Job was fun to watch. It was a good double-cross/revenge story that kept me thoroughly entertained all the way through.<br /><br />Kudos to Director F. Gary Gray for making such a good feature film when his directorial resume mostly consists of rapper videos. Gray's other most recent notable feature films were 2005's flop sequel to the classic Get Shorty (1995) and 2003's A Man Apart (which I have not seen).<br /><br />Storywise, The Italian Job really worked well. It had a good flow that kept you interested. There were way too many of the typical over the top Hollywood action film sequences that are just plain old unbelievable: cars driving down busy sidewalks at high speed; driving through a busy subway; people surviving sure-death situations; absolutely zero police response to what would realistically summon a cavalry of cops...these kinds of surreal action take a bit away from the movie.<br /><br />The cast is pretty good, and the acting is very good. The story is familiar enough as it is popular throughout the history of film: A heist is made by a group of thieves/one of the crooks goes rogue/the group seeks revenge.<br /><br />So if the genre is up your alley, then by all means The Italian Job should work for an evening of entertainment. And if you like it, you're in luck....A sequel has been announced for 2008 called The Brazilian Job with (mostly) the same cast and director (the most important aspects in a recipe for a successful sequel).<br /><br />Let's hope in the sequel that Gray keeps a better handle on reality. I'm sure that it'll be F.I.N.E.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) has planned a gold heist with a group of professionals in Venice, Italy, that displays his sophisticated style without using violence.  In order to accomplish the heist Croker has asked the old-timer John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) to help crack the safe in which the gold is located.  They get safely away with a large amount of gold, however, Steve (Edward Norton) has decided to keep all the gold for himself and kill the rest of the group.  Steve shoots John while the rest of the group escapes, but they decide on settling the score with Steve as they decide to take the gold back with the help of John's daughter Stella (Charlize Theron).  The Italian Job is a fun and suspenseful action film with car chases and dubious schemes, which leaves the audience with a good cinematic experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>Look, this is a very solid and professionally produced motion picture, and if all you are seeking is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours, this film will do as well as most.  But the fact is, we really have seen it all before.  In the case of this film, literally, being an inferior remake of the 1969 version starring Michael Caine (though, to be fair, the plots are quite different).  There isn't anything truly wrong with the film.  The chase scenes are expertly performed, the suspense is just right, the gimmicks engaging and interesting, and, for the most part, the cast highly entertaining.  <p>So why did I feel a bit let down afterwards?  Well, in part because of Mark Wahlberg.  Three things kept running through my mind as I watched him.  One was that he is absolutely terrible compared to Michael Caine's job playing Charlie Kroker.  Caine is one of the great actors in recent decades in the movies, while Wahlberg is pretty much this year's flavor.  A second thing was that the great Jason Statham, who plays Handsome Rob in the film, would have been an infinitely better Charlie Kroker than Wahlberg (maybe its the Cockney accent he has in common with Michael Caine).  Finally, as I listened to Wahlberg flatly deliver one line after another in a dull monotone, it occurred to me that he is clearly one of the worst actors in the world.  Either that or he is content to sleepwalk through a part.  I ought to add that he was surprisingly good in THREE KINGS, though I haven't seen him in anything that was especially well done since.<p>The rest of the cast, thankfully, is much better, though no one is really given much of an opportunity to put their acting skills on display.  Charlize Theron is one of the best actresses in the movies when given a role that draws out her skills (like MONSTER, which should net her an Oscar in a couple of days).  She isn't just a pretty face.  Jason Statham is fine in his rather undemanding role.  I would love to see him in a really dark and bleak film.  I am not sure how wide his range is, but I would like to find out.  Edward Norton is a great actor, but his part, like most of the others, didn't call at all upon his considerable talents.  <p>I did enjoy seeing Donald Sutherland in his brief but key role as John Bridger, the safe cracker who is also the father of Stella (Charlize Theron).  Sutherland starred with Julie Christie in one of the most famous films ever set in Venice, Nicholas Roeg's 1973 DON'T LOOK BACK.  I couldn't help think of that in the various shots that demonstrated that it really was Vienna.<p>By the way, in one scene where you can see Steve Frezelli's (Edward Norton's character) widescreen TV through an outside window, you can definitely see Michael Caine's image on it for a second or so.<p>In short, this is a slickly made film that didn't require much of the actors and doesn't demand much on the part of the viewer.  If one watches it with minimal expectations, one might enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A13H2JJ3GEMJN1.html">A13H2JJ3GEMJN1</a><br/><p>I'm not going to tell you that THE ITALIAN JOB is the most amazing flick ever. In fact, I'm not even going to tell you that it's a good &quot;caper comedy&quot; like the professional review at the top of the page does. I don't even know where that comes from. Granted, the movie has some funny lines, but it's no comedy.<p>What I AM going to tell you is that this is a good movie if you want a fast-paced action flick. It has clever heists, some amusing dialogue, a couple of great chase sequences, some very pituresque locales (the first part of the film was shot in Europe), and the players all give very solid performances. As another reviewer noted, this is a great popcorn flick.<p>Was THE ITALIAN JOB the most memorable movie of 2003? No, but the buzz surrounding it was pretty positive. That got me to go see it when it was in the theaters and I wasn't disappointed. I liked it well enough to get it when it came out on DVD. I think most other people will like it, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GYX971VETQBV.html">A2GYX971VETQBV</a><br/><p>"The Italian Job," in many ways, seems to remind me of a sequel to "Ocean's Eleven."  Get together an interesting, big name cast and assign them each a specialization.  Launch this talented group of individuals into a world of immense action and crime in which the cops and authority seem to hold no place-the battle is purely between the "good" bad guys and the "bad" bad guys.  I enjoyed this film, but not as much as "Ocean's Eleven" or even "Sneakers"-another film with a somewhat similar premise.  <p>Although I don't think I'm as harsh as some others have commented, I wasn't particularly impressed with the acting in this film.  I was expecting more from Edward Norton, but perhaps the role just didn't allow for anything.  The action sequences in this film are good and I was particularly impressed with the helicopter scene-the flying is incredibly difficult to pull off and, as the special features inform us, was not added with computer graphics.  The special features on this disc are not anything special.  I watched all of the little short documentaries on the various aspects of the film.  While they are interesting and provide some insight into the making of the film, there really isn't a whole lot to say about a pure action film.  <p>While it's not as good as "Ocean's Eleven," the film is still worth a look if you're interested in those types of movies.  Grab some popcorn, turn off your brain, and enjoy little Mini-Coopers drive around the screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Sure this movie may have borrowed some technigues used elsewhere but it comes together as a caper adventure film unlike any others. Wahlberg and Norton are fantastic and the rest of the supporting cast are super.<p><p>I was disappointed that Donald Sutherland's role was so brief, but even so he is quite effective. The story line of revenge is only marginally contrived but the director brings us around to his way of thinking. He sets us right with the incredible precision heist mechanics and the wonderful chase scenes and of course the cute Mini Coopers.<p><p>Any fan of good remakes of older heist movies with above average acting like &quot;Oceans Eleven&quot; and &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; should love it.<p><p>The DVD quality is unsurpassed and all the extras including a making of documentary and the Mini Cooper stunts make it well worth owning.</p></br><a href="../users/A20ZFWGBY4REFX.html">A20ZFWGBY4REFX</a><br/><p>Even though I never really seen the original 1969 version of "The Italian Job" with Michael Caine, this explosive 2003 remake is, hands down, the best crime film that I've seen since the 2001 remake of "Ocean's Eleven", especially since "The Italian Job" has suspense at every twist and turn, compelling and daring escapes, and excellent cinematography! The hard-edged direction of F. Gary Gray ("The Negotiator") was nothing short of excellent! The talents of Mark Wahlberg ("Planet of the Apes"), Charlize Theron ("The Devil's Advocate"), Edward Norton ("The Score"), Seth Green (The "Austin Powers" films), Jason Statham ("The Transporter", "Snatch"), Mos Def ("Brown Sugar"), and Donald Sutherland ("A Time to Kill") were top-notch, powerful, and commanding!<p>This remake of the 1969 film focuses on career criminal Charlie Croker (Wahlberg) and his team: computer expert Lyle (Green), wheelman Handsome Rob (Statham), explosives expert Left Ear (Mos Def), and inside man Steve (Norton). Along with Charlie's mentor/veteran safecracker John Bridger (Sutherland), the team has successfully pulled off a daring heist at a heavily guarded palazzo in Venice, Italy. The prize: $35 million worth of gold bullion! After a clean getaway, Charlie and the crew experienced a threat that they never saw coming...a double-crosser! As it turns out, Steve just happened to be the double-crosser! And the end result: The death of John Bridger and leaving the rest of the team for dead as well! A year later, Charlie and the team find Steve in Los Angeles and they decide to get some long-awaited revenge, but they couldn't do it alone. This is where John Bridger's daughter, Stella (Theron), comes into the picture. Stella is an expert safecracker with nerves of steel like her father, and the murder of her father provides much of the drive for the conflict of the film. Stella reluctantly joins Charlie and the gang as they come up with a brilliantly smart and devious plan. The plan: To re-steal the gold by tapping into L.A.'s traffic control system and manipulate signals, thus creating one of the biggest traffic jams in L.A.'s history! Also included in the plan is that once they have reclaimed the gold, they can get away in their speedy, but versatile, Mini Cooper automobiles, which are small enough to drive on sidewalks so they can make a clean getaway before the massive traffic jam clears. Like Charlie says in the film, "We'll do it like the Italian Job." Because you see, this isn't about the money. This isn't about payoff. It's about payback!<p>In conclusion, "The Italian Job" has lots of action, harrowing suspense, brilliant stuntwork, lots of surprises, and outstanding performances from a top-notch cast! This is, by far, a DVD must-have to your crime caper collection! If you love movies such as this, then look no further than "The Italian Job"!</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q9YEG1XPEJN.html">A15Q9YEG1XPEJN</a><br/><p>The Italian Job is a remake of a British film of the same name.  I doubt there is a great deal here that is reminiscent of the original except the Minis.  That said, the actors in this film are quite obviously having a great time and it shows.  These actors are up to the task and then some.  Mark Wahlberg, Donald Sutherland, Seth Green, Edward Norton, Charlize Theron, Mos Def and a few others are here chewing up the scenery, milking the fun for all it's worth.<p>The plot is relatively simple:  Thieves who don't use guns steal 37 million in gold bricks - they get double crossed and have it stolen themselves - then they attempt to retrieve their ill-gotten gains.<p>What my synopsis doesn't tell you is there are all sorts of fun Bond-like devices and screwy situations that will keep you laughing and amazed at the same time.<p>Mark Wahlberg amazes me.  He earned my respect in Boogie Nights, but here he shows he's got longer legs to stretch as he tackles the straight man role in a comedic film.  He is really up to the task.<p>Seth Green is hilarious in his role, Norton, suitably creepy, Mos Def - unknown to me before - really a contender, and of course, Charlize Theron as the ingenue, is believable and engaging.<p>Nah, this film isn't great, but it's really good and it's almost good "clean" fun.  There is no sex, plenty of violence (but none graphic and none that is any worse than you'll find on TV), and only a few four letter words (to suitably secure a PG rating).<p>I think you'll have a blast watching this film.  I know I did.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>'Italian Job' was a definite surprise for me - a lot better than I expected.  Ostensibly starrring Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron and Edward Norton, this movie is completely stolen by six co-stars, Mos Def, Jason Statham, (especially) Seth Green...and three Mini Coopers.<p>Mos Def shows good comedic skills as explosives guy 'Left Ear.'  Statham - of 'Lock, Stock...' and 'Snatch' fame - is suave and cool as wheelman 'Handsome Rob.'  But Green is the scene-stealer here. As Wahlberg's computer expert, Green's movie-long rant about *he* was the true inventor of Napster is a pop-culture thing of beauty.  [Nice little non-speaking cameo appearance by Shawn Fanning brings an added level of authenticity.]  <p>Green also provides the comedic highlight of the film - providing some private, imagined dubbing on a conversation/pick-up between Handsome Rob and a cable technician named Becky.  It had the entire theater in hysterics.<p>In regards to the Mini Coopers, this might be the best product placement in recent memory.  The cars look fabulous here.  The marketing value to BMW is incalcuable.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>As do-overs of Michael Caine pictures go, 2003's THE ITALIAN JOB, in my eyes, easily torpedoes the GET CARTER and ALFIE remakes. There's not much that this version has in common with the 1969 original, other than that both films showcase them cute, tiny Mini-Coopers (if you can't find parking, you could just pick them up, put them in your pocket). Mark Wahlberg isn't one of those demonstrative actors, he's from that strong silent mold of heroes. So, whether understated or merely bland - I'm not sure which - Wahlberg is likable and he provides the grounding element. THE ITALIAN JOB is fast-paced and stylish and clever, and the revenge sub-plot is always a good draw to pull in an audience. But what really makes this movie is the swaggering, irresistible cast supporting Wahlberg.<br /><br />The film kicks off at a stately mansion sitting over a canal in Venice, Italy as master planner Charlie Croker (Wahlberg) and his crew of specialists successfully pull off a heist of 35 million dollars in gold bullion. But as someone not that famous once said: "No battle plan has ever survived first contact with the enemy." Steve (a slimy Edward Norton) is Charlie's inside man and, it turns out, Steve is the dirtiest scoundrel of the bunch, and the greediest. He double crosses the team and murders Charlie's savvy old mentor (Donald Sutherland) and tries to kill everyone else. Steve walks away, alters his identity and moves to L.A., believing that everyone's dead. He keeps on believing this for one year. After which time Charlie finally locates him. And then you just sit back and soak in the gratifying bit of vengeance as it plays out.<br /><br />This is the movies, so I guess there's a suspension of disbelief involved when Charlize Theron is introduced as Estella Bridger, a gifted safecracker who freelances for police agencies. She gets recruited by Charlie Croker in his revenge plot against Steve, and it's personal for Estella because Charlie's murdered mentor also happens to be her father. This is one of those roles that's real easy to coast on, and yet Theron manages to demonstrate equal doses of emotional vulnerability and steeliness. She's also an absolutely sick driver which endears her to me even more. She and the rest of Mark Wahlberg's crew easily sell the movie for me. Handsome Rob (Jason Statham) is the hunky Cockney-talking wheel man. Left Ear (Mos Def, fabulously laid back) is the demolitions expert. Lyle (Seth Green) is the geeky computer tech and is the film's funniest character. Lyle claims that he invented Napster, which his college roommate Shawn Fanning stole while Lyle was, in fact, napping. Seth Green gets the lion's share of the funny lines ("You'll never shut down the real Napster.").<br /><br />There are some alarmingly fun, snazzy bits in this flick. Watching the actors zip around in their souped-up, tricked-out Mini-Coopers, I admit to a moment in which I contemplated getting me my own Mini. I absolutely cracked up during Seth Green's Napster bits and his improvisational impersonation of Handsome Rob. And then the hi-tech stuff, from gaining control of the stop lights to figuring out which of the decoy trucks is the real deal. As always, a huge part of enjoying the caper genre is in watching the plan coming together and then the execution of it. And then, because we anticipate the plan somehow going squirrely - it always does - we wonder how our guys will get themselves out of whatever scrape. And scrapes are guaranteed once the film throws in a scary Ukrainian mob boss and a massive Samoan who tends to tell his lady friend to "Baby, go relax." whenever he wants to get rid of her. As expected, Charlie Croker manages to work around these highly dangerous characters. THE ITALIAN JOB, I wouldn't call it a strikingly original heist thriller. But going by the huge appeal and chemistry of the cast, time will fly by even faster than those Mini-Coopers. Plus, it's hard to pass up a chance to ogle Charlize Theron. Can't wait for THE BRAZILIAN JOB, whenever that comes out.<br /><br />This is the Special Collector's Edition and the DVD's bonus features are: "Pedal to the Metal: The Making of THE ITALIAN JOB" (00:18:16 minutes); Screenwriters Donna & Wayne Powers talk about having their screenplay translated to screen (00:05:48); The cast goes to "Driving School," where Theron and Statham turn out to be the most competitive students (00:05:37); "The Mighty Minis" - a segment about the Mini-Coopers featured in the film (00:05:39); "High Octane" - about the film's 3 primary stunts: the boat chase thru the Venice canals, the truck drop, and the helicopter's game of chicken with Charlie's Mini-Cooper (00:07:52); 6 Deleted Scenes - one extended scene in a bar as some loser lawyer hits on Stella and five scenes with Charlie and the gang tearing around in the Mini-Coopers with Steve's helicopter and the law in hot pursuit (total running time: almost 9 minutes); and the theatrical trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>Borrowing a few key elements, from the original 1969 film, the reworked version of The Italian Job (2003) is a slick, high tech affair that centers on revenge, rather than on executing an outrageously glorious theft, and bolstering national pride.<br /><br />In Venice, Italy, Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) masterminds the theft of a cache of gold bars worth 35 million.  His team includes safecracker John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), driver Handsome Rob (Jason Statham), explosives expert Left Ear (Mos Def), point man Steve (Edward Norton), and electronics whiz Lyle (Seth Green). The heist goes smoothly, and the mood is celebratory, until Steve pulls a double cross, kills John Bridger, and the crew winds up trapped in an SUV, submerged under the ice of a frozen lake, dodging bullets.<br /><br />Moving forward a year, Croker discovers that Steve has surfaced in LA, going under the name of Steve Frazeli, and gathers his group together, to try and steal back the gold.  Needing a safecracker, he turns to Bridger's daughter Stella (Charlize Theron), who happens to open safes for a living.  The assembled team heads to California, to get the "LA Job" done.<br /><br />Edward Norton has a talent for playing obnoxious characters you love to hate, and the arrogant, sneering Frazeli, is the kind of vermin that deserves to be crushed like a roach.  The man does have a keen instinct for survival, and quickly moves his stash of gold, when he discovers that he is a target.  A swift closer of loose ends, he ruthlessly eliminates the Russian dealer who was exchanging his gold for cash.  With his hand forced, and the Ukrainian mafia poking around, Croker has to quickly adjust his plans, and make a completely different play.<br /><br />The original Italian Job, was about English criminal, who with the backing of the British underworld, makes a play to steal a delivery of gold from the Fiat Company in Turin, Italy.  Remarkably, few connected with the 2003 update, seemed familiar with the 1969 classic.  The newer film is not a remake, or an adaptation, it is more of mutation, grabbing a few selected strands of original DNA material, and adding some high tech elements, purely American sensibilities, and coming out with something completely different.  Prior to being commissioned to do the screenplay, the writers for the update, had also never even seen the original film.  The few key story elements that migrate to the new film include, stolen gold bars, three mini cooper automobiles, looting an armored car, and the manipulation of traffic control systems.<br /><br />With Croker, Bridger and Left Ear, being predominantly behind the wheel, the mini Coopers are prominently featured, on the streets, and in subway tunnels, and the storm drain systems of Los Angeles.  It's a short, but pretty cool ride, with Frazeli following the action from above, in a helicopter.  The ending is PG-13 soft, without the satisfaction of seeing old Steve pounded down like a nail, and the gang finally getting to enjoy their ill gotten gains.  They say it wasn't about the money, but it that just doesn't ring very true.  The film could be much edgier, but things flow so smoothly for the gang, that there is never a feeling of real danger.  And the writing is not as clever as it thinks it is.<br /><br />There is no commentary track, but the bonus featurettes cover the usual making of topics, plus things like the participants lack of familiarity with the original film, the writing of the screenplay, the stunts, and the driving training that the cast went through.  An ultracompetitive Theron, evidently had great enthusiasm for the driving.  Co-writers Donna and Wayne Powers seem extremely pleased with their screenplay, and how it was executed.  That the original film was almost completely gutted, matters not.  Interestingly, no interviews with Edward Norton appear in the featurettes.<br /><br />Although far from a homage to the original film, for what it is, "The LA Job" is a very slick, bold, fast moving, if superficial, action thriller, that mostly entertains.  F. Gary Gray is apparently hands on director, who does have a flair for capturing action.  The acting is not bad for a film of this type, with Wahlberg, Norton, and Theron being quite solid.  Jason Statham, who is capable of much, much more, is an underused team player, and Donald Sutherland's appearance is brief, but impactful.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>An updated remake of the 1969 film with Michael Caine.

Gary Gray (Friday, A Man Apart)<p>The Italian Job is a fast-paced, entertaining, and fun crime caper. In a year of pointless remakes, this one fairs very well and boasts a terrific cast who deliver excellent performances.<p>The admittedly cliched plot follows the same set-up as most caper films, including the recent "Ocean's 11" and "The Good Thief," which, despite the hype, was boring and poorly edited: a crew get together to pull of a heist, the characters are briefly introduced, the preparation is set forth,and finally, it comes time to complete the heist, with lots going wrong. Despite the formulaic scenario, director F. Gary Gray's execution was high-energy and exciting, so the lackluster plot can easily be overlooked. One brilliant twis in the film has our characters rigging the stoplights of Los Angeles so they can drive right out of the city with a carful of gold (in a safe that they're stealing back after their double-crossing ex-partner, played by Edward Norton, stole it from them), with nothing but green lights, while everyone else gets red lights, thus keeping the roads plugged with the largest traffic jam in L.A. history and the police from pursuing them.<br /><br />All this leads to well-staged speedboat and car chases which produces nail-biting suspense in beautiful locations. From start to finish, the filmmakers rarely pass up a joke--they even find a way to use Napster inventor Shawn Fanning in a very funny cameo. <p>It's true the movie may have a few plot holes, and, yes, it works a little too hard to sell a happy ending, which is the only aspect of the film that DIDN'T work. But this kind of pure escapist fare can get away with a certain amount of flaws through high spirits and sheer inventiveness - both abundant qualities in The Italian Job. It's an adventure and a character study and a hoot-and-a-half worth of laughs. Frankly, all summer movies should be this much fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>What a terrific movie! "The Italian Job" was one of the best movies of the summer of 2003. There has not been a re-make like this one in years! This film is blessed with a brilliant script, solid cast of skilled actors (Seth Green was hilarious), breathtaking scenery and fabulous, realistic stunts. The pace is perfect - it moves slow enough to keep you following the story, but fast enough to make it interesting. The story is crafted in a way to make it completely believable, but still leaves you scratching your head thinking "How is that POSSIBLE?" To anyone looking for a nice change from the mundane, often brainless movies released, "The Italian Job" will get the job done.</p></br></body></html>

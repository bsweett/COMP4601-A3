Could it be that they're supposed to make you question things about life, trust, love, sex, marriage, the American Dream? Despite the pacing, this will have you--if  you are in any sense thoughtful, or introspective--wondering a lot of  things, in the film and in life. Stunning from frame one, it never  relinquishes it's tight hold on the senses of the viewer.  But that's why  it's an misunderstood masterwork. It draws you in and teases like an  impressionist painting.  You get too close to it, you begin to see flaws.  Things never are totally what they appear to be, nothing's ever all good or  all bad, black or white, I mean, can you really trust what you think you  see? Is the image of the good life, the good life? We all do kinda take  things for face value, that's for sure.  And movies are reflective of some  of our overall views. But movies are colored light images projected on a  screen, right? Real or unreal?<p>EWS messed with one's mind on several  levels--did you accept rich man's Sydney Pollack's explanation of the  mansion's going's on? Plenty of Freudian slips and verbal faux pas,  there--evil incarnate, there. Did Nicole have an affair with the naval  officer (even in thought) or not? Was Tom's (although we want to side with  the integrity of the main character) answer's to Nicole's questions--ie, he  never once felt enticed by a female patients body even in the clinical  setting--completely honest? Will men ever be as honest as women? Will women  ever be as dishonest as men? Or are they equally prone to being  corrupted/corruptible/incorrigible? Were you perplexed as to how  provocative those &quot;blue lust shots&quot; of Nicole with her naval  officer were--even if they were taken for the cinema, Tom &amp; Nicole are  married in real life and it must've been quite a surreal experience having  to go through it, for all parties involved. Notice how Kubrick's use of  color punctuated certain passions...particularly red. Almost like an Ingmar  Bergman film.<p>There are little nuances in Kidman's acting (take a look at  &quot;To Die For&quot; and &quot;Malice&quot;, by the way) that makes one  believes that she &quot;knew&quot; of Tom's goings on at the mansion,  (hell, she may have even been one of the masked sex slaves), at the  hooker's apartment, even when he is confronted at Pollack's--she didn't  have to be told, but the fact that Tom DID tell, however, sets well with  the American filmgoer's desire for a linear, &quot;and they lived happily  ever after&quot; story... at last, we want to believe our certain accepted  notions will never be challenged. But they are, and they always are...and,  sadly, most of us would rather keep our eyes wide shut to these  challenges...<p>For those of us who don't mind the challenge, the questions  and the debates, this provocative film is gonna be in our mental libraries  for years to come...</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>Be warned, as you watch 'Eyes Wide Shut'; if you are expecting an erotic thriller, or a fast-paced suspense film, or a 'By-the-Numbers' formula picture, you will be disappointed! Stanley Kubrick always searched for  themes that would challenge viewers, and force them to see the world in a  different light. 'Eyes Wide Shut', his final film, certainly does that, and  is a film that will be enjoyed more with repeated viewings.<p>What is  reality? This film challenges us to make our own conclusions, as we see the  story of a  Yuppie couple unfold. Tom Cruise, as the husband, has a  successful career, but is shallow and superficial, coasting along on his  looks and social contacts. Nicole Kidman, his unemployed spouse, is a good  wife and mother, but bored, and compensates by drinking and flirting, and  fantasizing about a Naval officer she'd seen the previous summer. As she  acknowledges her erotic daydreams to Cruise, he reacts, first with  jealousy, then with a desire to find an outlet for the sexual frustration  he feels. Thus begins nighttime odysseys into a dreamlike world of  discovery; of a friend's unfulfilled desires, of a dual-personality hooker,  of a teenager being pimped by her father, of a cult which may only promote  orgies, or may have a far more sinister intent. <p>Nothing is spelled out,  or made obvious, and Kubrick throws in clues which will have you reaching  conclusions that you may find will change, when the film is viewed again!  'Eyes Wide Shut' demands your full attention, and rewards you with an  enigma! Is ANYTHING what it seems? The film's final line, delivered by  Kidman, is coarse, but totally in keeping with Cruise's journey, throughout  the film, and provides the director a wry closure to this most unusual  film!<p>While 'Eyes Wide Shut' will never be rated as highly as '2001',  'The Shining', 'A Clockwork Orange', or 'Dr. Strangelove', it is  provocative and mysterious, and deserves your attention!</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>I believe that Kubrick's swansong is a great masterpiece, it is one of my favorite films and has been since I saw it first time. I felt under the film's spell from the very beginning: the camera was so much in love with Kidman's gorgeous figure, her golden hair; the music by Shostakovich - so European even though the film takes place in NYC. The film was so clever and so mesmerizing. The more I watched the more I realized that there was something vaguely familiar and strangely comical in the film. I kept thinking and it occurred to me that Kubrick paid homage and parodied Joyce's "Ulysses" in the same way Joyce himself treated Homer's celebrated poem. For me, there are so many similarities between "Bloomsday" and "Billnight", between both men's journeys and adventures on the streets of Dublin and NYC that I am curious if anyone else noticed that. There are visits to the Kingdom of Dead, sirens, Cyclops, the sorceress that turns men in pigs (the figure of speech that is :)). Both Bloom and Bill try to run from but can't forget and eventually come back to the only woman they are attracted to for eternity - Penelope - Molly Bloom- Alice Harford. Both deeply suffer from her infidelity (Bloom from the real one and Bill from imaginative but it hurts the same). Both are very insecure men who doubt their own masculinity and try to prove to them that they are the real men but they can't. Both are married to the strong women who would give them hope in the end - both "Ulysses" and "EWS" ends on the affirmative note. The last word in "Ulysses" "Yes" belongs to Molly just before she fell asleep and the last lines in EWS are:<br /><br />"Alice Harford: I do love you and you know there is something very important we need to do as soon as possible.<br />Dr. Bill Harford: What's that?<br />Alice Harford: F_uck."<br /><br />If that's not the happiest and most satisfying ending for a movie ever then I don't know which one is. For the great ending I can forgive a movie many sins. But to tell you the truth, "Eyes Wide Shut" is perfect, it has nothing to apologize for. It is the movie that would be admired many years from now. It is a perfect conclusion to the trilogy of great journeys of a man for search of himself - "Odyssey", "Ulysses", and "Eyes Wide Shut".</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>Forgive the shameless alliteration, but whether you are in a relationship or not, and whether you dig Kubrick's works or you don't, you must watch this movie. Even if you feel that the director goes berserk with some scenes (e.g., a vivid masked orgy in a posh mansion with Gregorian chants in the background), and even if you are otherwise accustomed to the cut-crazy NYPD Blue type of rush modern cinematography, which is diametrically opposed to the ethereally unfolding cinema of Kubrick, there is something very deeply moving about the nuances of this movie's identifiable characters on the verge of marital collapse.  <p>The film is actually inspired by the 1926 novel "Traumnovelle" by Arthur Schnitzler, which was based in the decadent Vienna of the 1920's (sidenote: highly recommended book, now sold under the label of "Eyes Wide Shut" right here on Amazon). Of course Kubrick's version is based instead in modern Manhattan and studies the life of a well-to-do couple (Kidman, Cruise). <p>The story unfolds with all the smooth pizzazz of almost any Kubrick venture, effortlessly going from domestic discord to sexual obsession to murder mystery. Cruise, playing a doctor with all the right connections and a very good lifestyle, is convinced that his wife is deeply loyal to him. Until one day she confesses how she had once contemplated having an affair with a naval officer whom she had only glimpsed across a hotel lobby. This confession comes after an upscale party where they both found themselves in the hands of lustful but unsuccessful seducers. The roots of his faith shaken, Cruise examines his own lusts. After an unconsummated dalliance with a Greenwich Village prostitute, he eventually finds himself in an ominous mansion where wealthy masked participants indulge in dark ritual orgies, and perhaps even murder. But in a world where faithfulness is revealed to be little more than an illusion, can evil be any more substantive?<p>There is really very little that can be said about the movie's weaknesses. Perhaps the orgy ritual may come across to some as a little baffling but I believe it very stunningly symbolizes our inherent instincts for philandaring. That the unrueful participants should feel necessary to don masks and hide their identity while doing their deeds only underscores their haplessness in the face of their desires. <p>The movie will keep you on your toes, and just when you think you have figured it out you will be presented with something uncanny. The denouement, in fact the very last word before the final credits roll, is a strikingly apt summary of almost all marital relationships. <p>Come to think of it, the whole movie sports dialog that is sharp and crisp, one of the reasons I watch movies more than once, which makes this DVD a very worthy purchase. Highly, highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick was never known for a being a director whose films instantly catered to the masses.  Even popular films like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and THE SHINING generated tons and tons of controversy over their meaning, and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE shocked people with its elliptical approach to violence.  Kubrick's last film, EYES WIDE SHUT, released three and a half months after his untimely death in 1999, held true to form.  There is no unanimity.  In my opinion, however, this kind of debate makes for a great film.  On that score alone, that makes EYES WIDE SHUT a masterpiece.<p>Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman star in this disturbing psychosexual drama about an upscale Manhattan couple--Kidman a typical housewife, Cruise a good doctor--who become torn over conflicting views of love and sex after Kidman spots her husband playing up to a pair of models at a party held by a good friend (Sydney Pollack).  And when Cruise is called out late one night to comfort the wife of a client who has just died, he will soon find out not only how thin the line between men and women really is, but also how blurry the difference is between dreams and reality...<p><p>Collaborating on the screenplay with Frederick Raphael, which was inspired by Arthur Schnitzler's 1920s novel "Traumnovelle", Kubrick turns and twists EYES WIDE SHUT into something extraordinarily complex, something that cannot be understood with just one simple viewing.  Like all of his films before it, EYES WIDE SHUT must be seen more than once to get the full impact.  Even then, it is extremely ambiguous and deceptive, forcing the viewer to analyze in his or her mind what the exact nature of dreams really are.<p>This kind of ambiguity and the very fluid shots and Kubrick's handling of the dialogue, much closer in tone to the way real people talk, makes for a film that is incredibly long (at 159 minutes) and, for some rather boring.  But Kubrick's films have never been typical Hollywood fare anyway, and in fact have often been hugely influential on other directors (Spielberg, DePalma, Scorsese, etc.).  In the end, EYES WIDE SHUT was a typical way for Kubrick to depart this world--to leave us with yet another film of his to be debating as the years and decades go by.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>As most people know, this was the great Stanley Kubrick's final movie.  I believe he died before the filming was complete.  It was also, ironically, filmed just before Tom & Nicole broke up (a bit of irony there?)  These facts alone would be enough to make this film a collector's item.  However, it also has some other things going for it as well.<br /><br />The story is about a Dr. (Tom Cruise) who is haunted by the notion that his wife (Nicole Kidman) has cheated on him.  Or, even if she didn't ACTUALLY cheat on him, she surely wanted to.  This leads him on an escapade of sexual deviance.  He considers hooking up with a girl who has a crush on him as well as soliciting the services of a prostitute.  He justifies his actions as a form of "getting even" with his spouse.<br /><br />The biggest gamble, however, is sneaking into a ritzy orgy scene where everyone is wearing masks.  The scene is bizarre and at the same time beautiful.  The ritual with the prostitutes is downright surreal.  This sets the stage for everything else that happens in the movie.<br /><br />If you're into erotic thrillers, this one belongs in your DVD collection.  Makes me wonder how much of this kind of thing really does go on in High Society places.  Also, Nicole Kidman takes her clothes off for the first time in quite awhile, and I do believe there are more nude shots of her in this film than any other movie I've ever seen her in.  That alone is worthy of the price of this DVD!</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>Eyes Wide Shut was released in 1999 after Stanley Kubrick's death, and was misrepresented by well-meaning but misguided publicists as something resembling a non-stop orgy of sex, which it's simply not. If anything this mysterious film is the epitome of non-eroticism. So what is it? It is a somewhat quiet film about a human being suddenly cast into a self-authored but barely understood quest. It is about jealousy, sexual exploration, insecurity, love, lust, danger, and ultimately redemption and forgiveness. The sets Kubrick had designed and created, as he did in so many of his previous films, are astonishing in their scale and intricacy, and the soundtrack, such as it exists in this whisperingly still movie, hit exactly the right notes at the right moments, especially Jocelyn Pook's soul-stirring composition for the Black Mass scene at the exact center of this story. Eyes Wide Shut walks a thin line between metaphor and reality, wishful fantasy and actual happenings. How much of this story is real and how much takes place in the imagination of its central character, here played with unusual depth by Tom Cruise? I fall into the "it all happened" camp but I can certainly see how the reverse might be true.<br /><br />In Eyes Wide Shut, a handsome, successful young doctor, Bill Harford, finds the security of his comfortable life thrown askew when in the wake of a Christmas party in which he and his wife, played by Nicole Kidman, both interacted with strangers in a light, flirtatious manner, his wife reveals to him how close she once came to having an affair with a Naval officer. What follows next takes place primarily in the course of a single dream-like night as Harford leaves home to go to the deathbed of a long-time patient, and then rapidly plummets into a strange world of sexual promise and danger. Harford has a patient throw herself at him (no other description fits), encounters an attractive prostitute and allows himself to return---to an unforeseen outcome---with her to her flat, then he persuades an old friend, an itinerate musician, to let him to infiltrate a party at a lavish estate in the country, where the masked guests, presumably among New York's society elite, engage in unabashed sex acts amidst a setting reminiscent of the orgies of centuries past.<br /><br />In the aftermath of this life-altering night, Harford's self-confidence, in fact his very identity, is shaken to the core. He feels he has become embroiled in what was possibly a murder, for which he is to blame.  Far from being the confident, wealthy physician from the opening quarter of the movie, Harford is a desperate man who seeks out answers, all the while clearly terrified of the enlightenment those answers might bring. The soft world of the night becomes a harsh labyrinth of confusion as we again trail Harford, this time out into the daylight, where we share his desires to know more. Ultimately we must accept, as does Harford, the only answers he receives, satisfactory or not, and are glad when he embraces the closure he is given by both a friend and more unexpectedly, by his wife.<br /><br />Eyes Wide Shut is imperfect. A few of the acting performances fall short, and the spark of romance seems lacking between Cruise and Kidman (real life provided the answers for why) but when taken as a whole, this story, these visuals, the music, the intricate display of mastery of craft that is here in Eyes Wide Shut, all this combines to be a five-star production, and it is almost an all-time motion picture masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A9I40WFF40R4.html">A9I40WFF40R4</a><br/><p>I have seen this movie three times and am happy to say it has grown on me. I'm still not sure I understand the movie but perhaps I'm not supposed to. There are unanswered questions when the movie ends, at least for me. It's certainly about the subconscious, sexual fantasy, dreams, reality, etc. I'm not sure Kidman and Cruise, though both beautiful and easy on the eyes, were the best choice for the lead actors. They appear to be playing themselves. I notice that a lot of people thought there was too much nudity. There's plenty of that, at least female. My biggest complaint is that parts of the movie are tedious and dull;(the movie is too long) I'm thinking in particular of the scene where Kidman and Cruise get stoned. High people are dull; these two are no exception.<p>The movie, however, is beautifully filmed. The scenery is lush and rich in detail, particularly the interior shots. There is great suspense here. The section of the movie at the masked "orgy" is brilliant and the best part of the movie. Parts of this movie will haunt you long after you see it.<p>This is not Kubrick's best movie; but even when he's not at his best, he's better than most other directors.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick is my patron saint. In my mind, he is one of, if not the greatest, filmmaker of all time. My first Kubrick experience occured when I was in high school. I was over at a friend's house, and the film that he was watching was THE SHINING. I had never seen anything like it in my life. Not only was it scary as hell - it was - but the sheer inventiveness of the film making stunned me. I started noticing the tracking shots. Most of the film is a series of long tracking shots and zooms. They were all beautifully executed and framed. The lighting also struck me. It was different than what I had been used to, and I liked it. The beauty of this film was in the simplicity of how it was put together. There was simply no need for the MTV-style editing that had become so popular with the "cut, cut, cut, cut" mentality of the time, which was quite pervasive, and was growing tiresome. Kubrick would simply set up the shot, and let the actors act. There were no distractions, and the story simply told itself. I was hooked, and it instantly became one of my favorite films. I've probably seen it more than fifty times.<br /><br />Later on, I discovered A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and FULL METAL JACKET. Both of these films resembled THE SHINING in their meticulous attention to detail, and not only that, but the films were rich, not exclusively in a technical sense, but on an intellectual level as well. The best thing about watching a Kubrick film is the thought process that you go through afterwards, when you reflect on what you have just seen. You get to peel back all of the intricate layers, and sometimes you don't even realize what you have just seen until the fifth or sixth viewing...which moves me on to Kubrick's final film, EYES WIDE SHUT.<br /><br />Principal photography for this film lasted for 400 days, and it was entered into the Guinness Book of World Records as the "longest constant movie shoot". Obviously with this film, as with every other film that Kubrick made, time was no obstacle. Only someone with Stanley's track record could have pulled that off. Furthermore, if he was anything at all, he was a perfectionist. He pushed his crew and his actors, pushed them so that he could get the best that they had to offer. If the performances of some of his actors seem overplayed, it's only because "naturalistic" acting never appealed much to Kubrick, as he would always say, "Natural is good, interesting is better." The "interesting" aspect would come after fifty or sixty takes of the same scene. He would bring his actors to the point where they literally had nothing else to give, and then that was oftentimes the take that he would use. Filming on EYES WIDE SHUT played out like this, and thank the heavens that it did, because the final product was nothing short of another masterpiece.<br /><br />The thing that separates EYES WIDE SHUT apart from the rest of Kubrick's filmography could be summed up in one word: hope. Yes, you read that correctly! EYES WIDE SHUT is a very hopeful film! Kubrick was often accused of seeing the dark side of human nature. This would be correct. His films are extremely pessimistic, in that they hone in on the dark side of human nature. Humans are portrayed as weak, ignorant, stupid, and beyond redemption. Most of the time, he was just being honest, and that was hard for many to stomach. But here, in his last film, he embraces themes of passion, commitment, loyalty, and even love. The whole film is a cautionary tale about the dangers of marriage, the temptation of adultery, and how important it is to hold tight to your spouse, taking nothing for granted. After all, we are human. Any one of us can be tempted at any given time. No one is exempt from that. Kubrick understood this. He also understood that divorce rates were through the roof, and that close friends of his had cheated on their spouses. All he had to do was turn on the television to see the latest celebrity scandal or divorce drama. These were situations that were very timely, very relevant to 1999, and even more so, today. Stanley Kubrick understood and respected the institution of marriage, and was, as far as anyone knows, faithful to his wife until the end. Somewhere along the line, however, he felt compelled to make this film, particularly after reading "Traumnovelle", a 1926 novella by Arthur Schnitzler.<br /><br />What we have here is the story of Dr. Bill and Alice Hartford, a upper class, married couple with a young daughter. When the film opens, they are getting dressed and prepared for a prestigious Christmas party that they have been invited to by one of Bill's patients. Alice gets up from the toilet, adjusts her hair, and asks Bill a simple question, "How do I look?", to which Bill replies "It's great". He's not paying her any attention, as he adjusts his tie in the mirror. "You're not even looking at it," she says. Bill turns around, and robotically tells her, "you're beautiful. You always look beautiful". It is here, during the very opening moments of the film, that we are able to see Dr. Bill's major flaw: he doesn't really appreciate his wife. They've been married for years, and, apparently, the act of complimenting his wife has now become routine. On to the party. Once Bill and Alice reach the party, their host comes over to greet them, and we then dissolve to Bill and Alice lovingly dancing together, musing and asking themselves why they were even invited to this overblown party in the first place. Bill sees an old friend of his, and takes off. In the meantime, Alice grabs a glass of champagne and waits by the bar. Out of nowhere, a strange Hungarian man comes over and starts to flirt. It's obvious what he wants from the start. He attempts to wear her down in her drunken state. "Don't you think one of the charms of marriage is that it makes deception a necessity for both parties?", he asks Alice. He has her cornered, and eventually, after several of his advances, she reminds him that she is married and walks away. Meanwhile, in another part of the house, Bill walks down the hall with two models hanging on each arm. Their game of seduction begins. "Don't you want to go where the rainbow ends?", they both ask. Bill isn't quite sure what they are asking, but he catches the hint. At that moment, he gets summoned by someone else, and he leaves the two temptresses to themselves.<br /><br />So, Bill and Alice have both remained faithful, and resisted temptation, for now. Later on that night, and with the help of a joint, Alice starts questioning Bill about the two women that he was with. He tells her that it was nothing, that they were just two dumb models. She also takes it upon herself to tell him of the Hungarian man that tried to seduce her. Bill tells her that it's only natural for men to feel that way. She's beautiful, after all. There's not much jealousy in his response. This sets Alice off, and she goes into a tirade. Bill, in his ignorance, also makes the statement that women don't think the way that men do, as far as sexual matters. She stops him dead in his tracks, and tells him that when they were vacationing the year before, she made eye contact with a young naval officer. She goes on to say that it was only a glance, but that she would have been willing to give up her family and her life for one night with him. She came to her senses, but the fact remains that the thought of infidelity was on her mind, and she could have acted on it.<br /><br />From here on, Bill becomes insanely jealous. He realizes that his wife isn't just a prop. She is capable of hurting him, and he sets out to prove that he is just as capable as she is. He goes out on the town, and his journey into the sexual underworld begins. He is faced with temptation the entire night, but every time he is close to giving in, he is interrupted. One interruption happens to come in the form of a phone call from his wife. However, he proceeds and is determined to explore, almost hoping that an opportunity to be unfaithful will present itself. Before the night is over, he ends up at a masked, pagan orgy filled with powerful members of society. Here, he sees just how sick and depraved the idea of infidelity is. It's so fitting that the password to get into the house is "fidelio" - "faithful". It is exactly the opposite. This scene, probably one of the most controversial scenes in film history, is not sexually enticing at all. It's ugly and horrific. It's a picture of hell on earth. It represents the evil that is adultery and sexual debauchery. The scene plays like something out of "Rosemary's Baby".<br /><br />The core of the film is in the last few moments, where Bill confesses to Alice of his night time journey. His eyes are filled with tears. "I'll tell you everything. I'll tell you everything!", he tells her.<br /><br />The last scene takes place in a shopping mall. Bill and Alice's daughter runs around looking at dolls, while they talk amongst themselves about recent events. "The fact is that we are both awake now," Alice says, "and I do love you." She then suggests that they go home as soon as possible to have sex. This scene is powerful and brutally raw in it's honesty. In Kubrick's only love story, he has taught us the importance of the covenant of marriage, and how it is important to treasure your husband or your wife.  There is such a thing as healthy jealousy, and both Bill and Alice have learned this valuable lesson by the film's conclusion. They will strive to keep each other away from the darkness, to appreciate one another, taking nothing for granted.<br /><br />The controversy that surrounded this film was predictable. The orgy scene is twenty minutes of Sodom and Gomorrah. It is brutally honest in it's raw portrayal of sexual debauchery. However, I feel that, as repulsive as this scene is, it is a necessary evil which is needed to convey the depravity that we live amongst. Sexual immorality is not pretty. It should not be presented as such on film. Kubrick was never a prude when it came to pulling us out of our comfort zones. He was always honest, no matter how much it hurt or how ugly we thought it was. If you look closely at each one of his films, they all have a moral center. He was not pleased with the way that he saw the world, and like us, he wanted things to change.<br /><br />"In a modern world that is rife with infidelity, lies, hedonism and sexual decadence Stanley is encouraging us all to throw away our masks and take a good look in the mirror. His final and most underestimated masterpiece is a call for an end to all forms of secrecy, be they personal, social or political." - Rob Ager, from his essay, "Unseen Reflections"<br /><br />Tragically, Stanley Kubrick died two weeks after the release of EYES WIDE SHUT. He was quite pleased with the final product. Like all of Kubrick's films, it opened to mixed response from the critics. Over time, this film has aged like a fine wine. That's the thing about his films. They get better with age, and as Steven Spielberg said in an interview, "They tend to grow on you." I have personally found this to be true. Every time you watch one, you learn something new, or you see something that you had never noticed before, and who knows, you may learn something about yourself.<br /><br />It is in this way that Stanley Kubrick left a legacy. He will never be forgotten and his films will live on, decade after decade, and will remain classics. Funny that he has a classic in just about every genre of film that there is.<br /><br />How many directors can pull that off?</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>Through Stanley Kubrick's camera lens, the universe is a cold and frequently sinister place.<br /><br />The man-made world of DR. STRANGELOVE marches to its wacky Armaggeddon even as its silly characters struggle valiantly to save it.  The technology that got us into the outer space of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY betrays us and leaves us as nothing more than a well-fed, well-dressed specimen to the powers we find beyond our solar system.  The government of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is so bent on behavioral modification that it makes a hero of a rapist thug like Alex the Droog.  The mask covering our historical and psychological sins is ripped away and leaves us as absorbed ghosts in the Overlook Hotel in THE SHINING.  And the military of FULL METAL JACKET chews up our young men and spits them out as psycho-killers razing someone else's countryside.<br /><br />So at the end of his life, Kubrick makes a love story.  Talk about confounding everyone on the planet, including his fans.<br /><br />Kubrick died just after finishing the cut that was released to theatres and much speculation has been placed on what he would've done before anyone saw it.  There were enough wild rumors during production.  Even now, I read a story that Kubrick was disappointed with the Hollywood power couple of Cruise and Kidman.  (Although he's a very earnest actor, Cruise seems to struggle with depth, but I thought Kidman was a good choice...although she plays getting high on marijuana too silly and ridiculous--has she ever been high?).<br /><br />But something worked for me with EYES WIDE SHUT.<br /><br />And there's something new here that's never been seen in a Stanley Kubrick film before: optimism.  Even as Cruise's love for his wife is assaulted by the haunting images of her making love to the officer in uniform, even as he recklessly follows paths to violate his vows and his faithfulness...something always stops him.  He doesn't ravage the hooker, he doesn't indulge in the bizarre private orgy, etc.<br /><br />Something always brings him home, safe and sound.  Something you never saw in the Kubrick film before.<br /><br />(When will they release a version without the computer-generated orgy attendees blocking our view?)</p></br><a href="../users/AO461REE0KA4J.html">AO461REE0KA4J</a><br/><p>Kubrick's last film is an existential tour de force.  It is a fascinating exploration into the sexual mores of modern man, handled with a masterful melding of subject matter and style that is typical of Kubrick.  Nudity is plentiful, but there is hardly any overt sex, for one of the movie's themes is REPRESSION.  The duality of human nature (recalling the line in FULL METAL JACKET) is once again the driving force of the plot: love/hate, honesty/deceit, reality/fantasy, freedom/repression, etc.  Kitman's performance is great.  Cruise's is alright.  Kubrick, well, is Kubrick.<p>This DVD is the R-rated version, and so is the remastered DVD edition to be released this June.  The unrated version without the censored scenes that Kubrick had objected to is not yet available as a Region 1 DVD.  In fact, no one in North America has seen the uncensored version.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8.html">A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8</a><br/><p>EYES WIDE SHUT is definitely not a typical Hollywood film with risque and  actions, but rather it is an accomplished film that evokes complexed and  nuanced emotions in polarized thoughts on sex, marriage and deceit. For all  the rumours of it being erotic and sexually titillating, audiences watching  it for this reason will undoubtedly be disappointed because the scenes are  hardly passionate. The drama unfolds in the glitzy New York stage which is  chillingly somber and dark, and Tom Cruise as Dr. Bill Harford finds  himself disturbed by images of infidelity after his wife, Alice (Nicole  Kidman) replayed out her fantasies. The mood of the film is serious and  surreal; Kubrick is a master at capturing the dark labyrinth and for the  questions it dissects and poses on faith and love - it is an awakening and  a moral dilemma acted out by Harford. It is adapted very simply from Arthur  Schnitzler &quot;Dream Story&quot; - the plot has no intricacies - but  rather the mood of the film overwhelms beautifully, even with Tom Cruise  trying to match his acting skills with the sublime directing. The sex  rituals are in my opinion - delicious terror that mirrors guilt and  evilness of human's heart. <p>It is controversial for the diverse and  radical thoughts in the movie - and definitely not on kinky sex. Kubrick's  directing is in fact what makes EYES WIDE SHUT miraculously alive - even it  loses grit and impetus in its last moment for the inconclusive ending. Of  course, with the directing overshadowing talented acts from Cruise and  Kidman, it is hard to see any memorable and versatile performances from  them. EYES WIDE SHUT is nonetheless a must-see for astute audiences who  sees the film for its savage beauty and provocative thoughts.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>Eyes Wide Shut is not the self-indulgent, opaque film that I had been led by some reviewers to expect.  It is clear and focused with an important and worthy theme.  Kubrick is exploring the nature of human sexuality in light of recent conclusions derived from evolutionary biology.  The theme can be stated simply: "marriage is a fortress continually under siege."  To be able to use Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as his married couple, who not so incidentally were actually married to one another at the time, was quite a coup since it lent accessibility and immediacy to his theme.  We are able to catch glimpses of what their married life might have been like and to see that marriage played out against the temptations of a cosmopolitan lifestyle.  Indeed with their subsequent separation, Kubrick's theme is ironically supported.<br /><br />Cruise plays Dr. Bill Harford, an attractive, high status, confident male who has always deceived himself about his sexual nature and the nature of women and especially the nature of his wife, Alice.  They go to a party and act out some "teasing themselves" roles, as they have undoubtedly done before.  Nothing comes of it since they are circumspect people.  But the next night Alice decides to strip away her husband's smug confidence about her nature and expose to him the truth about feminine sexuality, and so tells him a little story about how she was moved to abandonment by just a glance from a man in uniform.  Her expression is so vivid and powerful that Bill, stunned and shocked, begins to imagine this event that never took place, an event Alice has assured him, might well have taken place.  As he visualizes, he begins to explore himself as various expressions of human sexuality are thrown his way, the prostitute, the gay-bashing young men, the teenage girl entertaining older men...etc.  What he sees behind his mask watching the enactment of a secret medieval pagan ceremony tempts and enlightens him.<br /><br />This film did not work well for a general audience for several reasons.  One, many people did NOT identify with the privileged and glamorous couple.  Two, the resolution of the theme was without the usual violence and/or sexual indulgence common in contemporary American cinema, a disappointment for some.  Three, many young couples viewing the film together, or at least in light of their own marriages, were made uncomfortable and threatened by being reminded of their own temptations and frustrations.  To have the truth of our duplicitous natures rubbed in our faces, as it were, is not something everybody wants to sit still for.  Most people lie to themselves about their sexual behavior and especially their hidden sexual desires most of the time.  Kubrick wanted us to see how compromised we really are.  Finally, some were disappointed by an ending in which we see that we are human, all too human, and we have to accept that and live with it.  Bill, realizing what he has done, not so much in action, as in his heart, cries out to Alice, what shall we do now?  And she wisely says (because she has already figured this out): Be grateful that one day does not make an entire lifetime.<br /><br />What is wonderful about a film like this is that, instead of going to the movies, fat and comfortable with the steak and wine in our bellies, expecting to be diverted from the irritations of our lives and to be massaged by the story upon the screen (as in say, You've Got Mail (1998) or Titanic (1998)) instead we are confronted with some uncomfortable truths about our own lives, and made to squirm.  Our eyes are indeed wide shut, and we kid ourselves and tell ourselves lies about who we are sexually and what we really feel and want.  Marriage is a compromise with the world and with our nature.  Something is gained and something is lost, but this is no perfect world; and just as it is better to be respectable and a member of the establishment than to sleep in the streets, it is better to marry and maintain that marriage against our animal nature than it is to toss it away.<br /><br />Kidman is mesmerizing and reinforces her reputation as great talent.  As always she becomes the character she is playing.  Cruise is clever, cute and has great timing.  The sets are crisp and absolutely right for the story, and the dialogue is first class.  The sometimes annoying score is appropriate.  But this is not a great movie.  Some of the scenes could have been sped up, and Kubrick did play the suspense card a little too slowly at times.  I would rank it just below the best of Kubrick's work, somewhere between Dr. Strangelove (1964) and The Shining (1980), superior to Spartacus (1960) but not quite on the level of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).  Certainly we see the mark of the mature artist here in both theme and treatment.<br /><br />See this for Stanley Kubrick, one of cinema's most accomplished and respected artists.  It was his last completed film before he died.  Would that we had another like him.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q457CES5ZUZ.html">A2Q457CES5ZUZ</a><br/><p>From his introduction into filmdom's big time with "Spartacus" to the widely discussed "Doctor Strangelove" Brooklyn born Stanley Kubrick was immersed in frequent controversy.  It was only natural, therefore, that reacton to his final film "Eyes Wide Shut" sent the brilliant director out in a blaze of controversy.<br /><br />British screenwriter Frederic Raphael, who secured an Oscar for the 1965 drama "Darling" with Julie Christie and Dirk Bogarde, recounted in his book "Eyes Wide Open" which dealt with his relationship with Kubrick, recalled how he got a call from the director one day about a potential project.  The novel he was sent as an adaptation possibility he guessed to be a work by Austrian Arthur Schnitzler, a friend of Sigmund Freud.  Like Freud, Schnitzler was interested in exploring the sexual side of humanity as a clue and index to the species as a whole.<br /><br />That initial call resulted in close collaboration with Kubrick sending a cab to Raphael's South Kensington flat near Gloucester Road and transporting him to his suburban London mansion in quiet and leafy St. Albans.  Kubrick was a man of privacy and after he was satisfied with Raphael's adaptation of Schnitzler's novel "Traumnovelle" he undertook a vigorous 400 day shooting schedule that saw him succumb to death before the film could be completed.  The setting was moved from 1920's Vienna to 1990's Manhattan.<br /><br />Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, then married, developed such a close bond with Kubrick during the filming that he ultimately became a surrogate father of sorts to the attractive couple.  They were compelled to juggle their schedules and eliminate other work opportunities as the production was extended while perfectionist Kubrick insisted that as much time as was necessary would be taken to finish what he hoped would be a fitting masterpiece to culminate a brilliant career.<br /><br />Cruise and Kidman play a highly successful yuppie couple.  Cruise is a doctor while Kidman runs a gallery.  One night after coming home from a party, while Kidman is particularly high on marijuana, she picks an argument with him on the subject of sex.  She tells him about a Cape Cod weekend in his company when she observed a handsome young naval officer.  Kidman confesses that at that point, had the officer been willing, she would have given up her marriage to have sex with the stranger.<br /><br />Kidman's revelation results in Cruise exploring sex in Manhattan.  He observes an instance of child molestation in which an angry father berates the men seeking to take advantage of his young daughter, who begins flirting with Cruise when she shows up to rent a costume.  The costume is needed to crash a sex party at a Long Island mansion that features costumed participants wearing masks.  Before they engage in sexual activity a cult ceremony is performed.  Cruise looks out of place, is discovered, and told to leave.  Patient and friend Sydney Pollack, who was also an attendee, later warns Cruise of the dire consequences of ever crossing such powerful people.<br /><br />During Cruise's wild night of adventure he meets and befriends a prostitute.  He pays her following conversation without exacting sex.  Cruise later learns that she had terminal aids, recognizing how he had barely dodged a sexual bullet.<br /><br />Eventually Cruise realizes following his sexual exploration how much Kidman means to him.  At film's end they are seemingly closer together than ever.  The resulting irony is that following this film the couple in real life terminated their own marriage.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI.html">A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI</a><br/><p>4 Stars = Classic<br /><br />Is it a mystery? Is it a thriller? Is it a quasi sex film? Is it a horror movie?<br /><br />A little bit of all four.<br /><br />It is Stanley Kubrick's last film, & Kubrick is always interesting!</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>From the reviews I have read, it seems that this movie is supposed to have a moral or a meaning, since Kubrick is such a great director.  I don't know if I agree he is that good, but this movie to me had a clear meaning and message.  Eyes Wide Shut attempts to explore the fact of how fragile marriege vows are.<p>I haven't decided if Kubrick takes a stand, or if he just presents this movie as a statement of fact, or a warning to be careful in a marriage, because it doesn't take too much to ruin.  Nor have I figured out a meaning to the last scene in the toy store.  But after watching the movie I came away with an overall message.<p>First, this movie has nudity, but like another reviewer said, it is not erotic.  It is however tragic.  The movie's message to me was this.  There is sex everywhere in society and you can get sex any time you want it.  Beautiful men and women are everywhere and society thinks nothing of you if you submit to sex outside of marriage.  So what holds marriages together?  Without getting religious or preachy, it is the commentment of the man and woman to each other.  The marriage vow can be broken by thought, such as when Alice confesses not just that she thought another man was cute, but that she would have given up everything for a night with him.<p>This devestates Bill, who in his mind sees Alice breaking part of the marriage vow.  He goes out for a night on the town and I think would have had sex if the circumstances were right.  He was willing to get revenge on his wife by doing something much worse that she did.<p>In the end, Alice and Bill are both equally hurt by the relevations of the other.  I think this movie is saying how easy it is to ruin a marriage through lust or adultery and that it takes a conscious effort by both parties to make a marriage work.  <p>Or Kubrick could be saying if you are going to cheat or lust over other people, keep your freaking mouth shut.<p>I thought this was an intriguing movie because I found myself rooting for the better side of each person's character to come through, and at the end it did, I guess.  I don't know really.</p></br><a href="../users/A8F2AZWB20X1H.html">A8F2AZWB20X1H</a><br/><p>If your taste in movies is action/fantasy/adventure/horror, this film is not for you.  If you appreciate a movie whose complex twists and plot turns and counter-turns puzzle you and make you think, "Eyes Wide Shut" is a masterpiece.  Stanley Kubrick was never an easy director to understand and his last movie is a powerful, intriguing enigma.  I'm not a fan of either Tom Cruise or Nicole Kidman, but I thought they were both excellent in this film.  Cruise plays a doctor with a comfortable lifestyle (beautiful wife, cute daughter, plush digs on Central Park West), who is devastated by his wife's mock confession of a fantasized infidelity, which sends him out into a night journey in which fantasy and reality become so intertwined that we can't see where one stops and the other starts.  How much do we really see?  Do we sometimes go deliberately blind in order not to see?  Kubrick explores all this and more in this exquisite film, and when the couple wake up to the cold light of day, they are left to realize that fantasy, however distasteful, needn't destroy everything that reality has built up.  A lot of people hate this movie simply because they can't understand it, and it moves at the pace of an arthritic snail; but as previously stated, this is not an action film; you need to slow down and think and reflect as you watch it.  If you have sufficient maturity for this, then this movie is indeed for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FFPPPIOSI36M.html">A1FFPPPIOSI36M</a><br/><p>As in most post 70's, Stanley Kubrick movies, his films are challenging, require repeated viewings and demand the viewer to work to understand what's going on.<br /><br />Similar to "Fatal Attraction", this is a warning to married men to not explore what may be thought as "the other side of the fence" and to not take for granted what is not appeared to be broken. Men, don't mess with your marriage, you may not like what is out there!<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays a successful doctor that asks questions of his wife, that he should not neccessarily want the answers, and then, after a marital argument, he ventures into the seamy ( I mean VERY SEAMY) side of after hours, New York, sampling the possible fruits of what can be had. It's scary and poses an eventual threat, not only to his marriage, but also to his and his wife's actual life.<br /><br />When I first saw this is the theater, I was disappointed. The utilization of such A-list stars, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, detracted from the microscopic, extremely personal and psychological story of a successful couple that appears to have it all yet there, nonetheless, exists a fragility that may instantly implode their perfect world. They were too big of stars however, the late Sidney Pollack is mesmerizing as Cruise's doctor cohort during the day, but a very scary, villain at night. His role was positively chilling.<br /><br />This is a challenging film that is not easy to digest. However, repeated viewings (even catching bits and pieces as it plays on cable) reveals an artistic masterpiece that is sterotype Kubrick.<br /><br />Most reviews go into too deep of an analysis of this movie as though the flick is extraordinarily complicated. That's a misgiving. I learned to understand and appreciate this film when I viewed it as a simple warning of not to take a marriage for granted.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick is among the greatest of directors preciseley for the reason why this movie has a delayed appreciation component. His movies are not forgettable, warrant intense study and provide a rich reward for a deep understanding.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>I'm not sure what I was expecting when went to see this in the theaters... but it was something like &quot;Six and half Weeks&quot; meets &quot;The Shining.&quot; I was wrong. The movie is very very Kubrick... slow, sticky  scenes that last just long enough to make you dreadfully uncomfortable,  music that is perfectly married to each scene and stark, surreal lighting  that's part fantasy, part cold reality.<p>This is a film about fidelity,  fantasy and the reality of marriage compared to the illusion of lust and  infidelity... the strength of marriage versus the weaknesses of lust....  good versus evil.... loyalty versus abandonment. <p>There's really not much  I can say without ruining the story... but this is a finely made film. Well  thought out, haunting, unforgettable. <p>I've heard a lot of people  commenting on this movie without having seen it... guessing from the  previews that it's just a sex flick... this is not the case. If your jaw is  not hanging open, you'll be sitting on the edge of your seat during most of  this film.<p>The DVD has TV spots, the theatrical trailer and interviews  with Cruise, Kidman and Steven Spielberg. If you liked &quot;2001: A Space  Odyssey&quot; and &quot;The Shining&quot; as much for the direction by  Kubrick as you did for the story this film will not be a disappointment.  Kubrick's hand is more than evident in this film, just like you can tell a  Renoir from a Van Gogh... you can tell when Kubrick has been behind a piece  of film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LP6O85Z894GT.html">A1LP6O85Z894GT</a><br/><p>The late director Stanley Kubrick was an unqualified visual genius.  Few film makers neither rivaled nor equaled his ability to fill an entire movie screen with information pertinent to the narrative structure of a film.<br /><br />Like Alfred Hitchcock, John Ford, Fritz Lang, the mature Steven Spielberg, the young Orson Welles, Martin Scorsese and Akira Kurosawa, Kubrick uses the elements of lighting, depth of field, action, composition, design, staging and sound to create motion pictures that breathe as living organisms, completely transcendent to the manufactured world of a blackened movie theatre. He will be sorely missed.<p>That said, Stanley Kubrick is also quite possibly also the most grossly overrated, pretentious and narcissistic filmmaker of the modern era. While his most famous pictures, "2001" and "A Clockwork Orange", are filled with magnificent technical advances and stunning visuals, they lack the humor, the insight and the pessimistic optimism (he loves paradoxes in his films) of his real masterpieces "The Killing", "Paths of Glory", "Lolita", "Dr. Strangelove"  and the sadly overlooked "Barry Lyndon".<br /> Which finally leads us to the much anticipated "Eyes Wide Shut" .<p>For anyone who has been in a bomb shelter since the Cuban Missile Crisis, Shut  features the real life husband and wife team of Nichole Kidman and Tom Cruise as a couple who share way too much in the way of intimate secrets.  <p>Driven by nothing more than a jealous fantasy, Cruise undertakes a journey into the sexual underworld of New York's cultural elite. The film unfolds very much like a nightmarish adult version of The Wizard of Oz  (one character even taunts Cruise to come with her "Over the Rainbow.") Kidman's hilarious closing line is a crude rewriting of "There is no place like home."<p>Crouching in the middle of the film like an ominous gargoyle-like  specter is one of the most disturbing sequences ever filmed. Straight out of Heironymous Bosch and filled with hideously masked writhing bodies, cryptic chanting, cloaked figures and demonic organ music, Kubrick makes Cruise's descent into perceived decadence complete. It is one of the most vivid portraits of Hell on Earth ever filmed. That sequence chills and haunts me to the bone still.<p>Besides the "hell" sequence, the film does contain much to reccomend it.  Kidman's performance is Oscar worthy in it's quite torment and grace. She is an actor of that most rare combination: talent, beauty and endless range. Hers is a career that will last. <p>The production design stunningly recreates New York on a London Sound Stage.<p>And of course at the center of it all is the film magician Kubrick, who does create a film of stunning visual power. It just isn't particularly entertaining or enlightening.<p>Which leads me to the final questions about the film. What is the point of it all? Is it a calculated warning to anyone thinking of wandering away from home and hearth? Are we the viewer supposed to identify with Cruise who is attracted by the promise of sensual delights, but leaves stunned by the growing evil? Or is it an excuse to film as Kubrick himself once said " A first class nudie film."? Who knows? Who cares?<p>Although deliberate ambiguity can serve as an effective device- one that can inspire hours of meaningful debate, it all to often represents in Kubrick's world, a muddled point of view. Such is the case with "Eyes Wide Shut".</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>Was it worth the attention? Definitely. Was it worth the money? Absolutely. Was it worth the effort? Certainly. Was it worth two years? Probably. Was it worth the wait? Not really. Does it deserve to be the last effort of the great late director?

They attentively invite the viewer into their fantasy world, in which dreams might be reality and the reality of one single night becomes a long unforgettable dream.<br /><br />As good of an actor as Tom Cruise is in this movie, Nicole Kidman manages to steal the show from him. The scene during which she reveals to her husband how she would have easily given up everything: him, her daughter, and her life for a naval officer is a powerful combo of her performances in the critically acclaimed To Die For and the Broadway play Blue Room. The only flawed scene for Kidman as Alice, an ex-gallery manager, who is currently unemployed, is the sequence where she tells her husband she had a terrible nightmare. Her sobs are unemotional in that scene and it does not come out as strong as the rest of her performance.<br /><br />The famously feared orgy scene is indeed peculiar. It captures the viewer attention, but is it really needed? That scene serves little purpose in conveying the true message of the thin line between imaginary and real life. The entire scenery inside the rich mansion, where the orgy scenes take place, where the masked men pray on hookers, is fantastic regardless of the controversy of its necessity.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick, a master of filmmaking, gives an imaginary twist to marriage, dreams, and reality of life. But once the viewer exits the theater, he or she is at loss of words and the thin line between the dream world and the reality disappears. Such effect is indeed Kubrick's last legacy.</p></br><a href="../users/A228JH8V9Y700G.html">A228JH8V9Y700G</a><br/><p>The general public just doesn't understand this movie.  They were expecting something flashy and maybe action as we were going to look at Tom Cruise and Nicole Kiddman and their "star power" was going to draw audiences unlike before.  But there were no explosions, no car chases, and literally not a lot of action.  This was not meant to be one of those movies, it was a train of thought with a heady, dreamlike atmosphere.<br /><br />Tom Cruise is on a sort of spiritual journey, as he gets it into his head that he wants to cheat on his wife.  He is presented with several situations in which to cheat, but something goes wrong each time and he never physically does.  It's about temptations, having that wonderful little bauble dangling before you and it's just beyond your reach.  A part of us wants it, wants it so badly, but we have to practice some discipline.  Don't be greedy, don't be selfish, and don't talk yourself into thinking that just this one time won't hurt.  It might be deeply satisfying to eat that candy bar now, but in the end it's just a candy bar, you'll be jogging many miles to burn it off, and you're better off not eating it.<br /><br />Some criticism?  It's a LONG movie, and you get very restless throughout.  I wish they had given Nicole Kidman more of a part, as I think her cream long since rose above Tom's even before they broke up.  Due to lighting and camera shots, the movie also has somewhat of a dreamlike feeling.  Everything's a little fuzzy, your buzz never quite wears off, and it leaves you a little nausious from time to time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZXDBATXFNZX.html">A3QZXDBATXFNZX</a><br/><p>Eyes wide shut is by far Stanley Kubrick's best film this film blows you away for the whole 2 1/2 hours.

It is a psychological  film, that not everyone will understand, probably because it's very hard to  understand.  The film has some haunting images, and it's by Stanley  Kubrick...<p>But this is not one of his better films.  Even if Film Scolars  look deep into this work, and understand it, the message is simple.  The  plot is simple, and even though it may seem deep, it's shallow on the  surface.  The film is slow in order to let the plot sit in, which most  people won't like, although it worked for 2001.<p>I know my review may be  confusing, but I'm so confused about this movie that I don't know what to  think.

I have always much preferred Kubrick's films for the look and composition more than the ideas, from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; to &quot;Full Metal Jacket,&quot; it's more the style than story. But here he was actually saying something. &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; explores the dark corners of a relationship, principally of marriage. It exposes the worries lovers have when they deal with trust and faithfulness. Kubrick brilliantly paints an effective and disturbing picture here. The character in the beginning who tries to seduce the Nicole Kidman character at a party reeks with evil poison and Kubrick just shows us the idea, he knows we're smart enough to figure it out. The performances are also superb. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are excellent, which is an achievement because as a married couple, this must have been a difficult movie at times because of the feelings and emotions it raises. &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; is a fitting finale for Kubrick. The orgy sequence is brilliant because it is not meant to turn you on, it's creepy, darkly atmospheric and Dantenean. I only wish a better ending had been filmed. It just resolves too quickly and simply with a little naughty word. Still, this is a good movie, dark, but sharp and intelligent and very complex. I was surprised because Kubrick, as I said, is more about style. He usually doesn't present philosophical genius mingled with brilliant visuales like Oliver Stone. But here there is something that speaks into the hearts of relationships. It shows why Kubrick is one of the lasting giants of filmmaking.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>this is Stanley Kubricks( director of The Shining and Full Metal Jacket) last motion picture as a great hollywood director. the leads are powerful and you always gotta have Sydney Pollack fighting with someone and getting angry. lots of nuidty is plentiful in this movie but besides this its a great paranoia and mystery film. works good if your stoned</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z7TU96G2WB9B.html">A2Z7TU96G2WB9B</a><br/><p>Watching the cinematography and the pacing, I am taking back to other Kubrick films like "2001" and "A Clockwork Orange."  The overall feel of uneasiness reminded me a lot of the latter.<p>This is a very sexual movie, and the conflict lies in sexual impropriety.  Oddly enough, the two protagonists, Cruise and Kidman, never have sex with anyone besides each other (and they are married).  The conflict is more in the mental act of being unfaithful, real or imagined.  The whole idea of the "unreality" of the whole situation is what Kubrick shows so well here.  It is unsettling.<p>Since there are drug and dream elements of the film, conversations seem to take a longer time than necessary.  It helps the ambience of the film, but I found myself waiting for Nicole to finish her sentence.  No one seems to believe what he or she hears (or sees) as evidenced by a constant questioning.  <p>I would recommend this to Stanley Kubrick fans and any one wanting to watch a master director at work.  I would not recommend this for casual viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>If Stanley Kubrick took a break from death to read some of the reviews here, I can only hope he'd slip into uncontrollable laughter.  But then he'd have to pause.  "Why," I suspect he'd ask, "do my films attract such empty barrels?"<br /><br />Anyway, I hope I'm not one of them.<br /><br />Eyes Wide Shut, I think, is a deceptively simple meditation on human honesty in the context of our dearest human institution ... marriage.  Of course, much of the dishonesty in relationships centers around sexuality, and the conflict between the sexual roles imposed by the institution itself, and the far less clear lines that exists within each of us.  And so, we round pegs shoved in the square holes of an artificial and ancient institution struggle to be both open and closed to each other.<br /><br />In the marriage at the heart of this film, both husband and wife have their own, hidden fantasies, longings, disappointments, and wishes that don't fit neatly into what is expected of them.  Nicole Kidman's character, in a moment of marijuana induced honesty, admits to having something less than an idealized fidelity to her husband ... that the mere glance of a stranger could destroy it all (and nearly did once).  Of course, Cruise's character has secrets of his own, and Kidman's brutal and devastating disclosure plunges him into fugue state where his own conflicts of role and sexuality surface.  Cruise's journey touches on many areas of the "forbidden" ... from homosexuality (the taunting of "roughs" leads him into the hands of a prostitute uncertain whether he belongs there) to a possible dalliance with a patient to a ritualistic orgy.  Of course, much like his wife has owned her hidden side, he must, eventually, own his ... and he does.<br /><br />A central metaphor here is the mask.  And with his mask finally stripped free and sitting on his pillow, Cruise (never before wanting to remove his mask or costume) relents and tells all ... and we can only hope, by that point, that his relationship can survive transformed ... or not.  It depends on who or what you are rooting for, as with any great film.  Their is fodder for both points of view.<br /><br />Eyes Wide Shut is a powerful searchlight into the psychology of sexuality and marriage, into truth and honesty, and into the question of who (and what) we really are.  Don't be put off by the pedantic and lunatic silliness of many of the reviews you'll read.  They're mainly by folks desperate to sound smart, to read more (and sometimes less) into the film than is really there.  Eyes Wide Shut, thankfully, doesn't need their help.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>Whether you are in a relationship or not, and whether or not you dig Kubrick's works, this is an interesting movie to watch. Even if others tell you that the director goes berserk with some scenes (and one could say he does, for e.g., a vivid masked orgy in a posh mansion with Gregorian chants in the background), and even if you are otherwise accustomed to the cut-crazy NYPD Blue type of rush modern cinematography, which is diametrically opposed to the ethereally unfolding cinema of Kubrick, there is something very deeply moving about the nuances of this movie's identifiable characters on the verge of marital collapse. <p>The film is actually inspired by the 1926 novel "Traumnovelle" by Arthur Schnitzler, which was based in the decadent Vienna of the 1920's (sidenote: highly recommended book, now sold under the label of "Eyes Wide Shut" right here on Amazon). Of course Kubrick's version is based instead in modern Manhattan and studies the life of a well-to-do couple (Kidman, Cruise). <p>The story unfolds with all the smooth pizzazz of almost any Kubrick venture, effortlessly going from domestic discord to sexual obsession to murder mystery. Cruise, playing a doctor with all the right connections and a very good lifestyle, is convinced that his wife is deeply loyal to him. Until one day she confesses how she had once contemplated having an affair with a naval officer whom she had only glimpsed across a hotel lobby. This confession comes after an upscale party where they both found themselves in the hands of lustful but unsuccessful seducers. The roots of his faith shaken, Cruise examines his own lusts. After an unconsummated dalliance with a Greenwich Village prostitute, he eventually finds himself in an ominous mansion where wealthy masked participants indulge in dark ritual orgies, and perhaps even murder. But in a world where faithfulness is revealed to be little more than an illusion, can evil be any more substantive?<p>There is really very little that can be said about the movie's weaknesses. Perhaps the orgy ritual may come across to some as a little baffling but I believe it very stunningly symbolizes our inherent instincts for philandaring. That the unrueful participants should feel necessary to don masks and hide their identity while doing their deeds only underscores their haplessness in the face of their desires. <p>The movie will keep you on your toes, and just when you think you have figured it out you will be presented with something uncanny. The denouement, in fact the very last word before the final credits roll, is a strikingly apt summary of almost all marital relationships. <p>Come to think of it, the whole movie sports dialog that is sharp and crisp, one of the reasons I watch movies more than once, which makes this DVD a very worthy purchase. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>1999 was a pretty big year for movies. From the groundbreaking effects of the "Matrix" to the phenomenon that was the "Sixth Sense" to the "Phantom Menace", the first Star Wars film in 16 years, it was quite an eventful year. In addition to that there was "Eyes Wide Shut", the latest film by influential director Stanley Kubrick, his first in 12 years and would end up being his final film. It of course got massive hype: from the fact he was finally making something new, to the star power of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman to its long shoot (400 days), excitement was huge and it can be fair to say disappointment was bigger. It's a fine film sure but it might not be everyone's idea of Kubrick's last hurrah.<br /><br />Bill and Alice Harford are a married couple of 9 years with a 7 year old daughter, Helena. Attending a party at a friend's place, the 2 of them separate and start to flirt with partygoers looking for a more intimate setting. They both decline and the next day, Alice reveals a truth: a one night stand she desperately wanted to have happen a year earlier that she didn't act on. This sends Bill on a journey through the streets of New York and exploring that possibility of being with someone that's not his wife but what he discovers is potentially more dangerous than just infidelity.<br /><br />The advertising made you believe that you were getting into some completely raunchy and X-rated with sex scenes and nudity running rampant. Turns out most of the nudity isn't played in scenes of sexual nature but just natural part of life and one's body. As for the sex, well, it looks explicity but you've probably seen worse. With this much press and speculation, you can practically see the audience's eyes giving a sense of shock; "that's it?" on their minds once the film's over. It's a slow, deliberately paced film with many characters chatting to each other with nary a mind-warping "Star Child" sequence or a hyper-edited sex scene to the William Tell Overture. This makes it more dreamlike but people might find it boring.<br /><br />With a star like Cruise in the lead role, some might find it distracting. He's gotten to that "superstar" level of acting where people see him less as an actor and more like a celebrity who just so happens to be an actor. While there is moments that seem "Cruise-y" in the film, it happens to be one of his more layered characters, along with Frank Mackey from "Magnolia". But it's Kidman who probably has the more interesting role to play since by the end of the film, you still can't get a handle on just what exactly this characters wants and whether what she says is the real thing. But this is the Bill show as we spend more time with him than Alice which is kind of a shame.<br /><br />Although it may not have that must-have status that a lot of Kubrick films have, don't think that it's a bad film because of it. It may not please everyone but it's at least a fine film on its own and a strange but fitting end to a long career.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GB1Q193DNFGR.html">A1GB1Q193DNFGR</a><br/><p>Stanely Kubrick was a brillant film director of ideas who composed some of the most philosophically and intellectually challanging movies of the last 45 years. Kubrick helped augment the way movies expressed themselves by  showing that motion pictures had the ability to convincingly convey complex  moral and philosophical issues by the forum of the moving image. Kubrick's  final film, Eyes Wide Shut, deals with the interdependant relationship  between romantic fullfillment and individual emotional identity. Both  function within the minds of the adults that inhabit Eyes Wide Shut's  world. Yet every major character in the film from Cruise and Kidman's  characters to Pollack's millionare to the female prositutes connect their  lack of sexual satisifaction to their failed conceptions of their own  lives. Everyone in this film attempt activities that might act like a  catalyst and break them free of their devalued state of mind, yet the  initial act just proliferates into a pattern and a downward spiral of  misunderstanding. The hidden society that is at the heart of this film,  deals primarily with the depths those will go to find self-worth and  satisfaction in their lives. Others dream of elusive possibilities that  might have ruined their lives but plague their fantasies. Sexual dreams,  acts, and fanatsies are the irrational kinetic tangent that lures these  characters into the bowels of insanity and beyond. Eyes Wide Shut is very  mature voyage into humanity's base instincts. It has one of the few  sexually mature and insightful naratives in the motion picture history.  Though flawed by some aspects, Kubrick last film still shows he knew  humanity till the end.I will definitely buy the EWS DVD edtion when it  comes out.</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>`Eyes Wide Shut' is Stanley Kubrick's last film and like every other film where he had complete creative control (For `Spartacus' and `Paths of Glory', Kubrick was largely an employee of Kirk Douglas), there is much which is both brilliant and puzzling.<br /><br />From the outset, I will say that while there is much nudity and some fairly explicit sex in this film, it is clear to me that all of this was done for a greater dramatic effect than simple `soft core porn'. This case should be clear if you compare this film with `The Story of O' which, while it has honorable intentions and high aspirations to be something more than a piece of pornography, the difference in the level of artistry should be obvious, as `The Story of O' is very high class pornography and `Eyes Wide Shut' is not.<br /><br />Much can be adduced from Kubrick's source, a work of fiction by Arthur Schnitzler entitled in German,`Traumnovelle' or `Dream Novel'. While I am not up on the details of Schnitzler's work, I know he worked in pre-World War II Germany or Austria at a time when the doctrines of Sigmund Freud were easily at their high water mark, especially among playwrights and novelists. One needs a copy of Freud open to work out much of the symbolism in, for example, Eugene O'Neill's plays such as `Mourning Becomes Elecktra'. This means that any sexual references are certain to have at least two or more interpretations, as Herr Freud and his students found sex to be behind most motives. And, for men, at least, that belief persists to today.<br /><br />At the very least, this literary source gives us a clue that a lot of what we are seeing has many dreamlike properties, if not explicitly scenes from a dream. Another thing this source explains is why the locations for the story are much more at home in Paris or Berlin or Vienna or Prague or Rome or London (where the film was actually shot) than in New York City. While American robber barons build their fair share of large houses and estates, they can't hold a candle to the opulence found in pre-World War I European houses of the nobility. It would not be a bit surprised if Schnitzler's original story took place in Vienna and its outskirts.<br /><br />The problem with the dream scenario is that there is no evidence that the highly improbable centerpiece scene of the story, a highly ritualistic pairing of strikingly beautiful virtually naked, masked women are paired up with robed and cloaked members, seemingly both male and female, of the onlooking crowd, in a very European looking suburban estate. Admission to these proceedings are exclusively by password changed every day, and given out, it would seem, to a highly exclusive group of (probably) exeedingly wealthy people. And, everyone participating in this erotic pantomine wear Venetian style maskes.<br /><br />I confess that it took me three attempts to watch the movie to its conclusion without falling asleep before the ending credits roll. Part of that is my fault for watching it late in the evening, but part is due to the fact that the pace of the dialogue and business is almost somnambulistic. This is not the Tom Cruise of `Top Gun' or `Days of Thunder' or expecially `Rainman' when he was in top form. I believe the relaxed pace was certainly coming from Kubrick's direction and not Cruise's acting. I tried to picture a more high powered actor in the role such as Nicholas Cage or Russell Crowe, and I could not see them adding any real energy to the performance.<br /><br />The very best scene in the movie occurs when Cruise's character, a highly respected doctor, rousts the owner of a costume shop out of bed at 2:00 AM to rent a tuxedo, cape, shoes, and mask in order to attend the password access only estate party. The shop owner, played by Rade Sherbedgia is a perfect study of a first generation immigrant shop owner in New York City. This scene also gives us some clue that all is not as it seems when the shop owner discovers his very nubile teenaged daughter consorting in secret with two very oriental gentlemen, while the shop owner and daughter seem to be or some central European nationality. The aura of strangeness is doubled when the good doctor returns the clothes the next morning and meets the two oriental gentlemen and the shop owner in polite conversation, with no trace of the fatherly rage of the early morning.<br /><br />To cut to the chase, this is certainly not Kubrick's best or most memorable film. `2001', `Lolita', `Dr. Strangelove', `Full Metal Jacket', and `Clockwork Orange' are easily better. Even his rendition of the obscure Thackery novel, `Barry Lyndon', starring Ryan O'Neill has some better moments than `Eyes Wide Shut'. And yet, it may still be better than 2/3 of the other movies made today. Like all Kubrick movies, it definitely succeeds in making you think about the film.<br /><br />Recommended for Kubrick fans and fans of all other `autre' directors such as David Lynch, Peter Greenway, and Ken Russell.</p></br><a href="../users/A34VV92TSLC37R.html">A34VV92TSLC37R</a><br/><p>Eyes Wide Shut is a very disturbing, intense film.  Well, I should say the last hour and a half are that way.  The first hour of the film is really slow, and if it weren't Kubrick, I would say it's even pointless.  The problem is, at the end of the movie, I look back on the first hour and all the conversations that took place, and ultimately I think that they make the movie what it is.  A disturbing, contemplative look at the human sexual psyche.<br /><br />Dr. Bill Hartford (Cruise) and his wife, Alice (Kidman) are a seemingly happy married couple.  One night as they are smoking some pot, they get into a substantial argument about Bill's view of women, specifically Alice.  This argument leads Alice to reveal to her husband that she almost had (or would have had, given the opportunity) an affair the last time they were on vacation in Cape Cod.  This upsets Bill and ultimately it is this story of desire that sets Dr. Bill off on his journey.  Obviously, the most famous scene is the orgy where Bill ultimately finds himself late one night.  While the American version has been censored substantially, the scene still does not lose its effect.<br /><br />Rather than go more in-depth in the story, I would just recommend giving the film a chance if you haven't seen it yet.  Cruise and Kidman give great performances, and Sydney Pollack has a good role as a friend of the Hartfords'.  The film is Kubrick in so many ways.  It relies on dialogue, music, and atmosphere to create tension, and it does an amazing job.  If anything, just make yourself get through the first hour, because from there the film takes off and you won't want to leave until you find out what in the world is going on.<br /><br />It really is a shame that this was Kubrick's last movie.  It makes you wish that he had made movies more frequently throughout his career, rather than just one every 6 or 8 years.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>&quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; is a very hard film for me to sit through. There is brilliance in just about every nuance of its story, in every masterful shot, in the superb direction of filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, who makes his presence known throughout the movie with his unique techniques of camera movement and cinematography. The story has little to be desired in terms of complexity and movement, which is subtly suspenseful and very poignant. But there are some aspects of the movie that cannot be passed by, like the film's gratuitous amount of nudity and sexual practice. But still, the movie has a lot to offer. <p>Kubrick begins this fascinating film by introducing us to William (Bill) Harford, a gynecologist, and his wife Alice. They are an upper-crust couple with a daughter living in New York City, and our first glimpses of their life seem perfectly normal and undemanding. Kubrick even goes so far as to show us their commitment to one another by putting them into several risque situations during a party scene in the first act. Alice drunkenly dances the night away with a total stranger, who keeps trying to persuade her to run away with him, while Bill is set upon by two women who are obviously doing more than making simple conversation. <p>The spin on their fairy tale marriage comes the night after the party, as Alice and Bill share a joint in their room. Alice brings up the two girls at the party, which Bill counters with her waltzes with the unknown man. Alice becomes antagonized by his opinions on women and the trust in their marriage, and reveals to him a sexual longing she once held for someone else in the beginning of their marriage. Bill is upset by this, and finds an excuse to leave when he is called away to visit a deceased patient. Thus begins an intense foray of extensive eroticism and sexual temptation that threatens to destroy their marriage and Bill's life. <p>The movie walks a fine line between fantasy and reality. Upon hearing his wife's admissions, Bill becomes plagued by dream-like visions of his wife's fantasy. It is these vivid pictures of his mind that drive him to the edge of fidelity, as he will later meet a hooker, attend a party which looks like something straight from the &quot;Kama Sutra,&quot; and find himself trapped in a web of deception among those he thinks are his friends as well as with himself. Kubrick masters Bill's subconscious by revealing a small piece at a time, leading up to the last full, shocking image of his wife's &quot;infidelity.&quot; These are small, shocking cuts, but remain important in the advancement of the character's mind. <p>Kubrick keeps the pacing well-timed and subtle, keeping the suspense at bay until the final moments when all the secrets are revealed. Attention is critical in watching this movie: there is a lot to miss by not giving your full attention to particular scenes. Each sequence plays a crucial role of some sort, whether it be an advancement of the plot or some small secret leading up to the big finish. <p>And what a finish it is. The movie is a milestone in creating a sense of high tension without ever going overboard on the suspense. Kubrick balances the physical and outer aspects of suspense with the inner tension of Bill's mind quite well, never losing focus of the point he is trying to make through this story. The ending is very satisfactory, one of those that ties everything together before finishing itself off in the last fade-out. All of the plot points you thought were useless and unnecessary come to light in a climax that is truly inspired and relieving. <p>Every nuance of this movie practically screams &quot;Kubrick!&quot; His attention to details and his grace in filming keep this film on par with his other films. I recognized his tracking shots, such as those of people walking down hallways, from his film &quot;The Shining.&quot; This is perhaps the most stand-out feature of his career, and one he is most noted for. His use of color and light imagery are also very fervent. His characters are cast in lights that make them look pale and death-like, while the surrounding colors of the set pieces and the streets are branded with vivid hues and tones. And the images are quite shocking, to say the very least, some of the most shocking I've ever seen in a movie. <p>Which leads me to wonder, was it really THAT necessary to have so much gratuitous sexual scenes spread throughout the plot? I know that Kubrick likes to shock his audiences with images sometimes,... but the graphic display of the party scenes seems to be a bit of a wandering from what the movie is all about. There's an old saying that goes, &quot;Less is more.&quot; The movie would do a lot better in following this adage, instead of showing all the goods. <p>The performances at the front of this motion picture are helmed gloriously by real-life couple Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, who play the married couple qith ease and extravagance (not like they needed any coaching or anything). Cruise is composed yet torn apart inside, barely showing emotion until he cannot hold it in any longer. Kidman's performance is both moving and disappointing at times. I found her confrontations with Bill about her fantasy to be quite disturbing and beautifully mastered, but in her revelation of a dream she had been having, her sobs seemed a bit forced and unconvincing. But, looking past all that, these two actors have a bravura talent that presents itself beautifully onscreen. And what about that chemistry? <p>Rounding things out, &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; is an inspired and mesmerizing look at fidelity, the mind, and emotion. Kubrick's masterful storytelling and filming techniques shine out in this, his final project, standing out as a truly brilliant achievement in movie-making. Pick it apart, and you'll find that there is more to this movie than what you see on its cover.</p></br><a href="../users/A106016KSI0YQ.html">A106016KSI0YQ</a><br/><p>Mispublicized as an especially steamy thriller by its studio, and sensationalized by the presence of its then married stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, Stanley Kubrick's last film enjoyed the same controversy that had dogged all his releases since the early 1960s. Based on Arthur Schnitzler's fin-de-siecle "Traumnovelle," EYES WIDE SHUT is a languid and dreamlike puzzle picture about a married wealthy doctor who, wounded by his wife's thoughts of infidelity, explores sexually straying from her and finds himself caught up in a nightmare of conspiracy and surveillance. Whether or not Cruise's Dr. Bill Harford is awake or dreaming through most of the film is somewhat up for interpretation: he lives in an unreal Manhattan created almost entirely on the soundstages of London's Pinewood Studios (Kubrick was too afraid of flying to shoot on location), and in the conspiracy he uncovers, most of the upsetting women he encounters are tall redhaired amazons who all seem doubles of his own wife. As with all of Kubrick's films, EYES WIDE SHUT is primarily about the de-humanizing cruelty of the world to the film's protagonists. The murderous wealthy and powerful cabal Bill uncovers (which practices masked hierogamous sex rituals in a Long Island mansion) really is simply a dream figuration for the mortality that dogs him, despite his handsomeness, wealth, and position; Bill's final talk with his wife Alice in a toy store during Christmas shopping suggests that sex is all that's left to them to keep the Grim Reaper at bay.<br /><br />The film is much more complex than my little summary can suggest, and since its densely allusive (as all Kubrick films are) it has acquired a substantial cult reputation. It's not one of his best films, but it's still quite good. Its weakest sequences are at the beginning, with a silver-haired Hungarian count who makes silly passes at Kidman's Alice at a holiday ball, and the much-talked about orgy that disappointed so many looking for something sexy (and instead purposefully shows ritualized sex acts drained of any eros whatsoever). Kidman surprised critics and audiences with her performance in this film, and she is genuinely quite exciting in all her scenes except for the misjudged drunk sequence at the ball, and Sydney Pollack as the rich Ziegler may be even better than she is, particularly in the scene close to the end of the film in his billiards room. As he did so often in the late 90s and the very early years of the 21st century, Tom Cruise seems cast in order for the smug fratboy type he played in the 80s to be shown to be broken and emasculated; he moves well and sometimes has genuinely fine instincts, but is not quite up to convincingly conveying anguish. Though its stiltedness is intentional, the dialogue by Fredric Raphael is the weakest part of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV.html">ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</a><br/><p>EYES WIDE SHUT contains considerable nudity, several fairly explicit scenes, and one sexual situation after another. But any one who approaches EYES WIDE SHUT with the idea that it will be sexually arousing is in for an extremely rude awakening. EYES WIDE SHUT is not a sexy film, and (Hollywood marketing men aside) no one in their right mind would describe it as such.<p>The story is intriguing.  Upscale New York doctor Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) fall into a drug-laced conversation--and goaded by Bill's rather archaic ideas about female sexuality, Alice reveals that she has had a powerful sexual fantasy about a man she once saw in a hotel.  Powerful though the fantasy was, the facts of the matter are much more prosaic: she never spoke to him, never had sex with him, and never saw him again.  But the authority with which she describes the fantasy, and the realization that women in general and his wife in particular are capable of contemplating such behavior, sends Bill into an emotional spin.  Unable to shake the image of his wife having sex with another man, he prowls the city--and wanders more by accident than design into one sexual situation after another.  Accosted by a patient, taunted by drunk men on the street who think he is gay, and even picked up by a prostitute, Bill eventually stumbles into the film's centerpeice: a secret society that gathers for cold-blooded and ritualistic fornication.  And once he trespasses upon the society, he suddenly finds that death and destruction follow his every move.<p>There are clearly several metaphors at work in the film.  EYES WIDE SHUT essentially presents sex as something that boils under the surface with a ferocity of which we are generally unaware--and then by stages ties sexuality to emotional risk, disease, perversion, cruelty, and ultimately death.  It is also flatly Strindbergian in its vision of women, presenting them and their sexuality as irrational elements that must be subdued and reduced to the mechanical lest they lead to absolute destruction.  And it is no accident that the story is set at Christmas with its story of a male God born of a virgin woman.  <p>But these are only the most obvious of the film's layers.  What confuses--and often enrages--viewers is the fact that Kubrick leaves a tremendous amount of wiggle room when it comes to both the story and what it means.  There is no clear-cut summation re anything: everything is presented in the most ambivilent manner possible and we are left to draw our own conclusions.  And this is as true of the plot as it is of whatever intepretation you attach to it; it winds back upon itself, ultimately frustrating any clear-cut response.  One might say that with EYES WIDE SHUT Kubrick tantalizes us with a secret that he keeps entirely too well.  I like the film, but people tend to have extremely divided reactions to it, and for that reason I recommend that you rent the film and decide for yourself before making a purchase.<p>In theatrical release, EYES WIDE SHUT was presented in a widescreen ratio; on both VHS and DVD release, however, it is presented in the ratio of a standard television screen.  Liner notes indicate that Kubrick intended the film to be seen in that ratio--but even if that is true it is a pity that there is not a widescreen option, for the visual statement of the widescreen theatrical release was somewhat more powerful.  If you are trying to decide between DVD and VHS and both price and DVD bonus materials are factors in your choice, you should know that there is no significant difference between the two.<p>--GFT (Amazon Reviewer)--</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Not to suggest that you can expect to see Kubrick's last film in a stunning new light on Blu-Ray, and although like any Blu-Ray it is certainly beautiful, by comparison to some other Blu-Rays, it is not an exceptional transfer.  I've had a Hitachi 1080i plasma on my wall for about a year now and I finally got a Playstation 3 so I can buy and enjoy Blu-Rays.  Unlike the switch from video to DVD, the upgrade to Blu-Ray doesn't necessarily mean I will have to start my movie collection all over again as I can play all of my DVDs as well, but I was prompted to buy Eyes Wide Shut (a DVD I do own) when I realized it was the unrated version only previously available in Europe.  I thought that might mean it would be closer to what Kubrick intended Eyes Wide Shut to be, but the additional footage is really just some extra sexual content.  I should clarify that it isn't really extra footage at all, it's just that a bunch of robed figures blocking our view from some naughty behavior in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005ATQD">American release</a> were actually removed in this version so you can see the naughty behavior.  I didn't even realize the figures were there and now I have to get my arms around the reasons why they were included to begin with.  I don't know, perhaps if Mike Huckabee becomes president those mysterious robed figures will make a dramatic comeback.  That might verify my suspicions.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I'm not convinced this is what Kubrick intended Eyes Wide Shut to be, but contemplating what he did intend is fascinating to me.  I actually consider Kubrick among my favorite directors, so this fascination is probably not as applicable to non-fans. Of his films, Eyes Wide Shut is, along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UJ48SQ">Barry Lyndon</a>, his least appreciated and most criticized, although not by me.  Eyes Wide Shut is actually one of my favorite Kubrick films.  Even though it is not as cohesive as his others; it is, on the surface at least, among his most stylized.  The interactions characters have are slow and deliberate and it gives the meaning behind each word and each frame more clarification.  Many call this quality dreamlike and it is.  Expressing reality doesn't seem to be a priority in Eyes Wide Shut and I wonder if the film was ever meant to be reality in the first place. Although the film is dreamlike per se, there is nothing at all to indicate that any of it was a dream.  In fact, the presence of the cult mask on Alice and Bill's bed verifies the exact opposite.  Still, I for one believe the style is absolutely intentional and that is supported by the meticulous photography in the film.  Almost every shot seems like it was mulled over again and again.  It is no wonder Kubrick had the reputation for doing almost a hundred takes.  He was a perfectionist and, at least visually, Eyes Wide Shut has more moments of perfection than not.  The acting is good too but really, the control Kubrick has is so evident that it is hard to credit the actors.  However, Nicole Kidman is particularly strong.<br /><br />With all that said, Eyes Wide Shut may seem otherworldly, but its psychological commentary on marital fidelity from the male perspective is very real.  Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) is told by his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) that she had at one time thought about having an affair.  The paranoia, possibilities, and the trials he endures psychologically and in terms of his fidelity to her, are tested as he walks around New York City and guides us through his many surreal and outwardly sexual encounters.  It is an exhibition of his gradual psychological breakdown after his wife shared her secret and all of his encounters seem to be taunting him in his fragile state.  There's more than enough here to make it a great film and to connect almost all of the dots, however, some interesting conspiracy theories exist about the orgy cult that becomes the center of the film's climax.  I'd recommend checking those out if you like this movie but I'm not going to reveal my opinion of them one way or the other.<br /><br />With all of that said, I thought the characters themselves are normal and well-adjusted, so the commentary itself is even more significant.  They are actually good people in a film about doing what is all too often perceived as bad things (i.e. sex).  I'm sure there are good reasons not to like Eyes Wide Shut, but for the most part I thought it was unfairly reviewed because of the sexual content and the sexual commentary.  We are so used to seeing nudity strictly used gratuitously, that it was easy to be cynical of its consistent use here, and that is just the visual sexual elements never mind what the film's deeper intentions are overall.  I'm not surprised I guess because if the film has a flaw, it is that it's too cryptic at times.  Either way, I think it's a great movie and it's nice to see this version released on the best technology we have.</p></br><a href="../users/AXOS8IWBXNZGT.html">AXOS8IWBXNZGT</a><br/><p>Last weekend the wife and I watched Stanley Kubrick's last film, Eyes Wide Shut. For her, it was her first time. For me, it was the first time since it had originally come out, back in 1999.<br /><br />When it came out, it left many people a little disappointed. Kubrick was a film-making master, and his last film seemed stilted, wooden, and mystifying.<br /><br />While I understand the comments of those days, I have concluded that people who thought in this fashion, well, missed the point. The film is a study in a particular aspect of human behavior: sexuality and sexual behavior within the confines of a marriage.<br /><br />Let's review. One night, following a party the night before where both parties in a married relationship engaged in some flirtatious behavior, the wife admits to having adulterous thoughts one day in the past. This severely unnerves the husband, a doctor, who then is called away due to the death of a patient. What follows is a series of near encounters with morally questionable sexual situations:<br /><br />  1. the dead man's daughter confesses her love for the doctor...she herself is engaged to another man<br />  2. the doctor meets a prostitute, and goes to her home, and is interrupted before things go too far by a call from his wife<br />  3. the doctor needs a costume to go to a party, and encounters what appears to be under-age sex between the costumer's daughter and some businessmen<br />  4. the doctor gets caught by the powers-that-be at an orgy for the highest class of society<br /><br />In all of these situations, the next day brings home all of the associated dangers with these encounters:<br /><br />  1. The fiance answers the phone when the doctor calls, bringing the doctor into conflict with another man<br />  2. The prostitute isn't home when the doctor returns...she has AIDS<br />  3. The young girl is offered to the doctor by her father...can you imagine the dangers in that?<br />  4. The power-that-be hustle one of the doctor's friends out of town by force, have the doctor visibly followed, and appear to have one of the orgies other attendees killed.<br /><br />The affect that this has on the doctor feels palpable and real...you can see it in the way that he looks at his family one evening, thinking that has whole family life is crumbling away, under siege from both his wife's tale, and from the consequences of his own actions and near-infidelity.<br /><br />What comes across as stilted is deliberately so...Kubrick wants folks to understand that certain things are staged, but the consequences of those things can be real. Compare and contrast Thomas Gibson's acting in his encounter with Tom Cruise (and vice-versa), and Cruise's own acting both when he hear's his wife's tale for the first time, and as he becomes more and more terrified of the consequences of his own actions. Kubrick is drawing attention to consequences.<br /><br />This is a set piece, like Lost in Translation, and a well-thought-out one at that. Kubrick's films were never simple ones, even going back to Spartacus. So, those who dismissed Eyes Wide Shut, I suggest you think twice. And for myself, it's time to resume the Kubrick film festival that got interrupted so long ago.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Some films need some resting time to be watched again several years later with wide open eyes to discover new dimensions in them. ? Eyes Wide Shut ? in one of these. Beyond the discovery by the two main characters that love is not sex, that love is not desire, that love is not passion, that love is all these, plus something undefinable that has to do with stability, with the future, with the transcendance of sex, desire, passion into the realization of a potential that is nothing but an instinct, and especially not the survival instinct, that has to do with going beyond limits not as an adventure, as a transient exhilaration but as an infrastructural building of the psyche, the mind, the soul, the real self, the ideal of the ego. In fact this love can perfectly admit some temporary, short and unconsequential moments of oblivion and excitation that will in return enhance the real love you may feel and experience for one person. Love has nothing to do with survival and everything to do with flying into new strata of being and new skies of imagination that cannot be cut off from what precedes even if they transcend it. This film thus shows how the wife has had a transient fit of desire, satisfied or not, it does matter because it intensifies the present and the future that can come from it because it is founded on the past. The husband discovers in one wild night a rite, a ritual, another side of everyday life, the reality of every-night phantasms that may have to do with something older and more fundamental than just sex in its anonymous garb of nudity and masks that would lead some to thinking that garb is garbage when it is in fact the necessary getting rid of all taboos and limitations that liberates the participants of their constant social acting by coming back to the physical and bodily basic needs in a way. It is devilish, satanic, luciferian, with encense and blind-folded music, and yet it is the only way to be able to play one's part in a society that requires everyone to be schizophrenic just to push this society towards its future. And yet, here, we feel and taste a sense of frustration and alienation in the two main characters. This cathartic trespassing is beyond limits for them. They will never be anything but ancillary servants for those who rule the world, have the real power that commands obedience and respect. The doctor will go on living in luxury because he makes homecalls and answers summons at any time of day and night, because he solves the problems of the superior class without asking questions, without wondering about ethics, without even questioning why he should be that subservient. Is it a denunciation of this ruling class of people who can do, and have to do, what all others will never even know ? Maybe, maybe not. Is it the recognition that there is a superior group of people who have been entrusted with the ruling of the world ? By whom ? Why ? How ? And then the rest of the world, even when they know this exists, have to keep their eyes shut and ignore it. And if by any chance they happen to know or learn about it, they have to forget it and bury it under a thick layer of knowledgeable oblivion. That's probably where the film should have a sequel, an extra development. What happens when this oblivion dissolves and gives way to remembrance, memory, recollection, remembering, and even revolt or rebellion ? Midlife crisis, they call it, but is it really that rejectable ? Why shouldn't everyone have the same possibility ? Why should we, ordinary ancillary servants, who have to be schizophrenic to survive in such a world and to be creative in a way, why should we not have the same need for cathartic trespassing ? The end of the film sounds bitter in the apparently recaptured equilibrium founded on pushing the recollection of what has been discovered into the inferno of forgetfulness. What will happen when these embers start burning again, when the Lucifer of this inferno of oblivion kindles the fire of recollection again ? Who is going to emerge in the husband, Abel or Cain ? Who is going to emerge in the wife, The Queen of Sheba or Phaedra ?<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Eyes Wide Shut is a long and somewhat sluggish film in parts but overall, this erotic drama is definitely worth a viewing or two. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are electric as a married couple with some "relationship problems". First off, this film has a lot of sex and nudity but what saves this film is the amazing musical score during that infamous "you know what" scene. This was Stanley Kubrick's last film before he died, there are some beautiful and breathtaking moments like the flashing Christmas lights on the streets of New York City. Sydney Pollack's performance was very aggravating, it takes him like 15 minutes to complete a full sentence! I enjoyed this slow burn of a film, I definitely had my eyes wide open than closed for sure!</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>...who, in his classic work, "Civilization and Its Discontents" asserted that repression of the unconscious is the foundation of what we consider "civilization" and a necessary evil.  Not all that breathtaking or revolutionary of an idea by itself---in fact, it's something that most conservative folk would basically agree with, though instead of "repression of the unconscious" they'd probably say "morality" or some other nonsense.  But it's the same basic idea: the basement is infinitely dark and scary, and you may want to go down and look around once in a while, but it's nowhere you'd like to stay for long.<p>Part of the genius of Stanley Kubrick is his ability to take fairly commonplace things and elevate/magnify them into something much bigger and more interesting things than they normally are.  He does this hear with the two mediocre lead actors (Kidman and Cruise), and also with Freud's little truism above.  <p>Cruise is a handsome man, with lots of charisma, and has made a career of playing the seemingly carefree, cocksure alpha male---and his range is fairly limited to that.  Kidman here plays a woman at once ordinary and very sexual beneath the surface---even though she is a fairly attractive woman (often reminded me of a young Meg Ryan) "sexy" would normally be quite a stretch.  <p>Yet both actors pull it off: Cruise shows flashes of genuine anguish, and Kidman (with the help of lots of tasteful yet sensuous nudity, most notably of her remarkable derriere) does project something other than the prim-and-proper-little-girl persona she usually dons for most of her other films.  And the film itself often does feel like a dreamy descent into the subconscious and much of its contents: fear, lust, jealousym, obsessiveness, sexual confusion, mistrust, etc.<p>As long as you don't focus on "what's going to happen next?" and just soak in the magic of each NOW frame, you learn to appreciate the richness of the present moment.  <p>This movie DOES seem slower than most of Kubrick's films, but if you keep the allegory in mind, you start to enjoy the sheer visual mastery that's in almost every frame of any Kubrick film, the atmospherics, and of course the music, which was superbly integrated into the film.  I'd hesitate to say that this is Kubrick's best, but still pretty darn good by industry standards.</p></br><a href="../users/A461VTLW9G9YB.html">A461VTLW9G9YB</a><br/><p>I tried to watch this film more than once to see if I &quot;got it&quot;.

Find something else to watch if you want to watch something Good.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KG8WLR1AKO12.html">A2KG8WLR1AKO12</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick's last release, &quot;Eye Wide Shut&quot; was a pathetic and misanthropic finish to one of the greatest careers in film making  history.  The only defense I can suggest is that perhaps had Kubrick lived  a bit longer, the film would have been dramatically improved.  Unfortunately, we are only able to judge the finished product that we see  before our very open eyes.  I have an incredible respect and  admiration  for Kubrick's past masterpieces.  &quot;Full Metal Jacket,&quot; for  instance, is perhaps the defining film concerning the Vietnam tragedy.  &quot;Dr. Strangelove,&quot;&quot;2001: A Space Odyssey,&quot; and  &quot;The Shining,&quot; will remain among the finest movies of all time.  Every artist, however, has  their inevitable failures, and the giant,  Stanley Kubrick, is no exception.<p>&quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; is so  incredibly awful that I am convinced only someone as respected as Kubrick  could have gotten it produced.  A  budding screen director would have been  ridiculed.  The banality of the dialogue prompted me to feel sorry for the  actors  who did their best to give the script some credence. Even the  members of the Academy Awards Committee could not find an excuse to  give  the deceased director a prize in even the minor categories.  Publicly the  motion picture industry said all the appropriate things.  The  virtual  silence, however, during the awards ceremony spoke volumes of how they  actually valued &quot;Eyes Wide Shut.&quot; One should also notice  that  the Amazon community reviewers have essentially ignored this movie. Is this  due to a subtle and tacit mindset that believes if you can't  say something  nice, you shouldn't say anything whatsoever?  The only saving grace of this  film is Kubrick's mind boggling ability of  photographing scenes.  My  breath is always taken away when observing the visual beauty of Kubrick's  artistry.  Could any other major  director do it better?  None comes to  mind.  Stanley Kubrick is significantly more skilled than even the talented  Steven Spielberg.  I  suspect that Kubrick was becoming very cynical and  bitter towards the end of his life.  &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; exudes a  misanthropic aura that  made the film difficult to watch.  The highly  publicized nudity was not in the least bit erotic.  The film's pervasive  coldness, subdued anger,  and unjustifiable length gave me the distinct  impression that Kubrick wanted us to suffer through this experience.  I  know little about  Kubrick's final years, but I doubt if he knew much joy  or existential satisfaction.  Chris Isaak's lyrics of &quot;Baby did a bad,  bad  thing&quot; is the signature song of this film.  It behooves me to  paraphrase Isaak and add &quot;Stanley Kubrick did a bad, bad thing.&quot;  Kubrick made  a film best forgotten and beneath his dignity.  Only hard  core Kubrick fans should waste their time.  Furthermore, I am also relieved  that  Amazon.com will allow me future opportunities to evaluate Kubrick's  remaining works.  These caustic remarks will most likely be the  exception.  I must reiterate my praise for all of the other Kubrick films that I was  privileged to see.</p></br><a href="../users/AC16NVPW23KGG.html">AC16NVPW23KGG</a><br/><p>I can't believe this was Kubrick!The visual style is true Kubrick, but this is a garbage piece of film from the mastermind that gave us Dr. Strangeglove, 2001, Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Shining, and Full Metal Jacket(ALL OF THESE FILMS ARE 5 STAR!!!)

Which appeared to lack something, and appeared superficial, and never really went anywhere, compared to Kubrick's other films.

Not only is it dull and boring, but it is extremely perverted and I can definately see why it almost got an X rating.<p>Now you may say, "But its supposed to be from the point of view of the main characters." That may be so, but Kubrick's entered that field before and done it better elsewhere (again, I reference "A Clockwork Orange"). This film is really just a disappointment.<p>Especially since it was the last film Kubrick did. I think many Kubrick fans want to say its good just so that they don't have to admit Kubrick's last film wasn't his best.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>perfect title wrong movie. i fell asleep fifteen minutes into the movie. it's that boring.</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>"Eyes Wide Shut" is Kubrick's best film since "Barry Lyndon" and a fitting end to his remarkable career.

I have seen basically all of Stanley Kubricks films, and unfortunatly his last was his worst. The story was just so wierd and twisted I didn't even want to finish watching the movie. With  all the hype this movie generated, and the actors in the movie, i thought  this would be great. Just turned out to be a stinker.<p>Hopefully Steven  Spielberg can do Kubricks other project AI some justice in the future, but  its unfortunate that this movie had to be so bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CWH6VKCTJAD.html">A3CWH6VKCTJAD</a><br/><p>It is unfortunate that Stanley Kubrick who has given us so many brilliant films ("Spartacus"; "2001, A Space Odyssey"; "A Clockwork Orange"; "The Shining"; "Full Metal Jacket"), should end his career with this one.  The  biggest problem with this film is the screenplay, which is all the more  perplexing since Kubrick helped write it.  It is hard to comprehend how  such a masterful filmmaker could miss the mark by such a wide margin.  <p>Let me begin by saying that the technical aspects of this film were  superb to the point of being superhuman.  Kubrick's camera work was pure  genius.  The color and lighting were impeccable; incomparable in their  impact and effect as well as their beauty.  Anyone who has seen this film  should go back and watch it again and just notice the way the sets are  lighted, how the shadows are cast, how the rooms in the background are  bathed in soft blue with contrasting colored lights perfectly splashed in  to heighten the effect.  As far as the sound, Kubrick can do more with the  well placed single note of a piano than most directors can do with an  entire orchestra.<p>That being said, the script can only be described as  grossly disappointing.  There were really two stories here.  The first is  the story of Bill (Tom Cruise) and Alice (Nicole Kidman) Harford's  relationship.  The second was the story of Bill's sexual odyssey resulting  in his crashing of an orgy for the rich and famous.  Too much was made of  the first and not enough of the second.  This should have been a  psycho-sexual film noir suspense thriller.  The elements were there for a  good one.  Bill's penetration of the sordid inner circle of sex games of  the powerful could have been a riveting thriller with proper follow  through.  But instead, Kubrick chose to deflate this storyline with the  unsatisfying dialogue between Bill and Victor (Sidney Pollack).  He then  returned to the Harford's relationship, which was a character study in "who  cares".  He ends the film as if their relationship was the point, which  left the film pointless.<p>Other than her ability to provide sexy set  dressing, Nicole Kidman was utterly superfluous in this film.  Worse yet,  this was probably the most wretched performance of her career.  Kidman is  not without talent and has given us some excellent performances ("Malice";  "Dead Calm").  Her performance here was tentative and strained, however.  There were times when she was so unnatural in the delivery of her lines,  one would have thought she was aphasic.<p>Tom Cruise gave an excellent  performance portraying a difficult and tormented character.  It was  somewhat of a departure for him to play a character that was so pent up and  emotionally torn.  He hasn't taken on a part this difficult since "Born On  The Fourth of July".  Usually he plays the straightforward macho type; more  action than depth.  I was pleasantly surprised by his ability to rise to  the challenge of this character's complexity.<p>I gave this film a 7/10.  The filmmaking was a 12, but the story was never developed to its full  potential.  It would have been interesting to see what Alfred Hitchcock  would have done with this story.  Perhaps Stanley and Alfred are talking  about that right now.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CZPM110DW516.html">A2CZPM110DW516</a><br/><p>"Bill, suppose I told you that everything that happened to you there...suppose I said that all of that was staged, that it was a kind of charade? That it was fake?"<br /><br />Victor Ziegler's words explaining away the bizarre orgy that his friend, Dr. Bill Harford, crashed the night before might be a more accurate description of Warner Bros' marketing campaign for Stanley Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut."<br /><br />After Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, then a real-life couple, were cast in the lead roles, the media hype was that Kubrick's final film was about sex, jealousy, infidelity, and the pitfalls of temptation, all of which certainly seemed to be the theme judging by the trailer over which Chris Isaak was heard singing "Baby Did A Bad, Bad Thing." Most critics and the public swallowed the bait and saw the film with their own eyes wide shut.<br /><br />"Eyes Wide Shut" is not really about sex at all, nor is it about "the elusive ambiguity of dream and reality," as the back cover of the published screenplay claims.<br /><br />LIke most of Kubrick's films, "Eyes Wide Shut" is so rich and multi-layered that it requires multiple viewings before its meaning becomes clear. Even then, much of it remains mystifying. But this much can be understood: "Eyes Wide Shut" is an expose of the world's elite and the occultic rituals they engage in on a regular basis. The bizarre ritual that Tom Cruise's character witnesses is more than mere hedonism, hence the cloaks, the masks, and the bizarre, almost churchly music. It is a Satanic ritual, and Ziegler is right when he tells Harford he wouldn't sleep so well if he knew the names of those participating.<br /><br />Just as Ziegler tried to white-wash the events, the media deliberately tried to control the public's perception of Kubrick's film. Ziegler is a little more honest. He prefaces his remarks with the word "suppose," a hint to Harford and the audience that he's telling Harford a bit of fiction in the hope of dissuading him from pursuing the matter further.<br /><br />And what are we to make of Alice Harford's "dreams"? And what about the daugher of Milich, the costume shop proprietor, whose father doubles as her pimp?<br /><br />Alice's dreams are more likely flashbacks to real incidents when she was victimized by the government's MK-Ultra mind control program that was exposed in Congressional hearings and which Kubrick touched on in his 1971 film of Anthony Burgess' novel, "Clockwork Orange."<br /><br />One question is how did Kubrick ever manage to make "Eyes Wide Shut" for a studio which is believed to be controlled by the very kind of people he was exposing?<br /><br />Following the success of "2001: A Space Odyssey," Kubrick was in an enviable position. Warner Bros. lured the world's most innovative filmmaker to their stable by offering him carte blanche. Kubrick's clout was such that he could even convince the studio to withdraw the very profitable and critically acclaimed "Clockwork Orange" from UK cinemas when he feared his family would be targets of violence from those who misunderstood the film. Kubrick was free to make the films of his choosing without interference from the studio, and always worked under strict security, keeping the nature of his work a secret even from those who were providing the budget. It's doubtful Warner Bros. realized what Kubrick had achieved with "Eyes Wide Shut" until they saw the finished film four months before its release. But like Cruise's Dr. Harford, Kubrick may have wandered out of his depth. On March 7, 1999, only four days after Warner Bros. got its first glimpse at the much ballyhooed production, Kubrick unexpectedly died, exactly 666 days before the dawn of 2001, the year he made famous with his landmark 1968 film.<br /><br />Yes, 666 as in the mark of the beast.<br /><br />Coincidence? Conspiracy?<br /><br />Aside from its themes, "Eyes Wide Shut" is as impressive as all of Kubrick's films. The production design, cinematography, and music are as flawless as they are unforgettable. The performances are also top notch. Tom Cruise, whose acting skills are often dismissed, is at his best here, playing a man whose jealousy leads him down a path where he learns much more than he suspected about the circles in which he socializes. Kidman is good, too, though she has some early moments when she unconvincingly overacts. Pollock as Ziegler shows he's still a better actor than a director (though he's not too shabby behind the camera either), and there's Leon Vitali, who played Lord Bullingdon in "Barry Lyndon" before working behind-the-scenes on Kubrick's last three films, as the sinister Red Cloak.<br /><br />"Eyes Wide Shut" may be Kubrick's most daring work. It is certainly one of his finest. If your own eyes remain shut to the truths of this film, it's recommended you see it again, this time as a double feature with Alex Jones' "Inside Bohemian Grove," available on DVD with the equally informative "Order of Death."<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I make it a point to watch this movie at least once or twice a year; for it is one of those films that touches you differently each and every time you entertain it.  Once I feel that I have my mind made up it is completely trampled and my perception of events is altered as my mind tries to re-contemplate everything I just witnessed.  That is the beauty within `Eyes Wide Shut'; a film so tragically misunderstood that many have labeled it pointless and even trashy without fully comprehending all that the film really stands for.<br /><br />The film almost feels lost within itself as it shifts from scene to scene; moment to moment, and in the final thrusts of the films focus we see an explanation (or is it) starting to form before our eyes, but what is so beautiful about the films construction is that that particular explanation (or any explanation for that matter) is completely contradicted the next time we watch the film.  There are no easy answers to the questions raised while watching this masterpiece and that makes for some of the most intriguing titillating post-viewing conversation.  Kubrick's visual styling is incomparable and his approach to the rabid subject at hand; his frankness and blunt rashness; elevates the material and builds a pristine foundation for the films more startling sequences.<br /><br />The film opens with high society couple Bill and Alice attending a party.  Separated from one another we find Alice drinking her detachment away and dancing too close with a stranger while Bill weaves his way through the large mansion to make his services available to those in need, one such individual being his good friend Victor.  This scene perfectly mirrors the characters development and their emotional connection to one another and to us as the audience.  Both Alice and Bill are in a sense playing variations of themselves, locking away their true identities for the sake of those around them.  They are not necessarily faking it or posing as someone else but more or less playing up the parts of them that others want to notice.<br /><br />As the film progresses we witness Bill's emersion into a dark underworld that he is drawn to out of a perverse curiosity yet repelled from because of his desirable innocence.  As he filters through his own feelings with regards his marriage and his life he tickles the keys of his own tendencies and this leads to some startling discoveries; discoveries within himself and those around him.<br /><br />`Eyes Wide Shut' is unfairly recognized for its fearless depictions of immorality; sequences that have proven to be the backbone of ones distaste or admiration of the film.  I say unfairly because those scenes are a small instrument used by Kubrick to paint a much larger picture.  If one only sees the film for the savage imagery then they have missed the final impact of the films true nature.<br /><br />Face it; we may never fully `get' this film, but to claim it nothing more than a perversion is simplifying it far too much, maybe in an attempt to justify our own misunderstandings.<br /><br />Kubrick was aided by some fantastic performances by the entire cast, most notably the two stars Cruise and Kidman.  Tom Cruise brilliantly captures his characters attraction to a world he doesn't quite understand.  Nicole has the most complex character in the film and she tackles her performance with real bravo.  Her understanding of what makes her character tick (and those priceless closing words "We have something very important to do...") adds so many layers to the films interpretation.  Sydney Pollack also delivers a very controlled and memorable performance and deserves attention for all that he serves with such little screen time.<br /><br />In the end `Eyes Wide Shut' is not a film for everyone, but it should be.  Yes, it is graphic and it is shocking but it is all done in a tasteful (although it may not seem so) manner that carries the film to all kinds of levels of brilliance.  As time passes the film continues to beam like a beacon for all other films to take notice of something far beyond their reach.</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick was tempted to do "Eyes Wide Shut" in 1970, but Christianne, his wife, felt that her marriage could be in jeopardy, so she implored him not to do it...

Alice is invited with her husband Dr. William (Tom Cruise) to a holiday party given by a New York wealthy broker called Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack).<br /><br />While Alice is dancing half-drunk with an effusive Hungarian (Ski Dumont), she was, at the same time, spying on her husband who was flirting with two models... A m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois is insinuated by the attractive girls, but a sudden interruption comes from Ziegler's private apartment which made the doctor climb upstairs to assist an attractive woman lying unconscious, repressed, overdosed!<br /><br />The famous mirror love scene, between Alice and her husband, reflected a missing sexual desire between them both... William was kissing his lovely wife on the neck while her glance seemed weary and tired... It seems that the eroticism has vanished from her boring life... Only a little intimate contact is left... Is she truly recognizing a necessity for a change, maybe for a new husband much more nearby...<br /><br />Looking for a certain sexual vengeance, Alice begins irritating her husband about adultery by testing his immunity, and relating some fantasy she had with a handsome naval officer last summer, she assures William that 'if the handsome office had wanted her,' she would have sacrificed everything, even her marriage and her child for one night stand!<br /><br />Feeling his word destroyed into fragments, and walking the dangerous streets of New York, William remembered an old friend he met in the party, the piano player Todd Field (Nick Nightingale). He decides to pass by...<br /><br />There, Nick divulges a secret... A secret place on Long Island... A ch?teau where he will be playing piano 'eyes shuttered'... But he continued, to get into the castle, one must have a mask, a disguise and he must 'know' the password...<br /><br />With shades of Hitchcock's "Vertigo," Kubrick starts to play, at this point, with his characters... He seems escorting them and leading the audience for some purpose, for one definite performance he prepared his whole picture for it... Kubrick did not create a film about sex... He made a film about the conception of sex... He wanted us to explore something inside our mind that we usually prefer not to discover... Through his eyes a visual work appeared, a cinematic technique breathtakingly beautiful, a perfectionism, precise and mystical...<br /><br />Reducing the dialog to a minimum, and with a distinguished confused music, we were in presence of a strange ceremonial rite, a picturesque ritual...<br /><br />Based on a psychological drama, written by the Viennese novelist Arthur Schnizler, "Eyes Wide Shut" is a mirror, audaciously obsessive in its dazzling revelations, profound, provocative and passionate, transmitted in a frame of sex, fear and death, that we have to see with wide eyes fully opened...</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>I saw &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; in the theater when it came out, and I remember thinking it was incredible. I also remember hearing lots of complaining from the other people in the theater on the way out. Basically this is a film you'll either love or hate. I think when it came out, people were disappointed because they were expecting a traditional &quot;erotic thriller&quot;, which this is not. This is a subtle, dreamlike, and very ambiguous film that explores jealousy, sexuality, death and the subconscious. I don't think most moviegoers (at least not Americans) are really comfortable with ambiguity in a film. They want clear, linear stories. But a film like &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, to me, is the opposite of an insult to one's intelligence, because it leaves many of the questions of the film up to the viewer to decide for himself. It is widely known that Stanley Kubrick finished this film right before his death. After watching &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, it occured to me that this film may have been his way of communicating that even close to death, life is still made up of many more questions than answers.</p></br></body></html>

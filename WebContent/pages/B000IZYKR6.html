Watch the film again and just watch her every second on screen. She is INCREDIBLE. What a PSYCHOPATH! This is a scary young girl to be sure, she could fool anyone with mesmerizing skill. The deception at the beginning featuring her youthful innocence leaves you shocked, unprepared to witness her true DEMONIC nature. I confess I crossed me legs in horror, it was so uncomfortably visceral. As for the film / dvd: the cinematography is razor-sharp and gorgeously blocked and lit. The widescreen composition is superb and the 2.40:1 aspect ratio is employed perfectly. There are two very good commentaries. It's particularly strange to hear Ellen and Patrick (who DOES look EXACTLY like S.Soderbergh early on) together given what happens between them!! The production documentary is insightful, including technical details, thoughts from the festival regarding sale to Lionsgate. This is an amazing effort, a very strong story and some of the greatest performances of the year. This is a film that will be remembered for many, many years to come. Excellent.</p></br><a href="../users/AVQJD41PLPOOQ.html">AVQJD41PLPOOQ</a><br/><p>This movie was filled with garbage I could not swallow.  I'm sure I've met overly-mature children before, but to suggest the diabolical, calculated revenge tactics that actress Ellen Page displays, even for the sake of fiction, is beyond my belief.<br /><br />Would you believe I actually found myself rooting for the victim of the 32 year-old photographer???  Why?  Because although his character was totally inapropriate, the story did nothing to convince me that he was the monster this little tries to get him to be.  By the time she was castrating him, I swear, I wanted him to kill her.<br /><br />If you're going to show a 14 year-old girl taking revenge against a monster, convince me that he's a monster, and don't wait until two minutes before he hangs himself on the roof of his building to do it!</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>`Hard Candy' is seriously one of the best films of 2006.  If you have not seen this little wonder I highly recommend you do immediately.  Director David Slade has done an extraordinary job in delivering a mesmerizing two person act that plays out so smoothly despite it sporadic and at times harsh direction.  That's the real beauty of `Hard Candy', its delivery, which imbeds itself inside your skull and stays with you throughout its full running time, and then still.  The film rarely sees a face other than those of the two leads, but those leads are more than up to the challenge.  Both Patrick Wilson and the young Ellen Page (who's receiving quote the attention for her upcoming comedy `Juno') are phenomenally cast in this dramatic thriller, but I'd be hard pressed to admit the real star is not David Slade.  I was so enthralled with his direction of this film and the risks he was not afraid to take.  In the end this film would have been nothing without him.<br /><br />The storyline follows a young 14-year old girl named Hayley who meets a 32-year old photographer named Jeff on the internet.  The film strategically opens with their chat screen so we can see their interaction before introducing us to them at a local coffee shop.  Hayley is the immediate flirt, as is Jeff, and they soon take their meeting back to his place.  Jeff thinks that everything is going according to plan until Hayley reveals she's not the sweet young thing he thought she was.  She has a secret agenda, a score to settle, a dark secret to unveil and she knows exactly how to do that.<br /><br />The film is a brilliant look at the drive of pure vengeance.  Hayley's character is driven by this inner power, this overwhelming need to exact revenge on a criminal who has apparently gotten away with it all.  She's one smart young girl and this catches her victim off guard.  The fact that I refer to Jeff as a victim is another reason why this film is so amazing.  It allows you to rationalize with a pedophile.  I'm not saying that that is something anyone in their right mind would want to do, but this film allows you to judge for yourself whether or not the punishment fits the crime.  I know that this is not the perfect analogy, and I'm sure people are going to complain about this, but it reminds me a little bit of `A Clockwork Orange', at least the feeling I got the first time I read it.  When you finish the novel you sit back and wonder if the means of justice were just as criminal as the reasons for it.  The same is here.  When Hayley is done the audience is able to sit back and wonder whether or not her means of action were just as horrific as Jeff's initial crime.<br /><br />This film would not have been nearly as effective if it were not for the brilliant performances by the two leads.  Patrick Wilson had such an amazing year, and while `Little Children' was his more popular film, his performance here is milestones ahead of it.  As Jeff he is so incredibly creepy in his charm but he is also pitifully heartbreaking in the eventual breakdown.  He's upstaged though by Ellen Page who gives my favorite performance of the year.  As Hayley she is so in tune with her character's motives and objective that she disappears within her character.  Beings that she was barely eighteen when she shot this film further goes to impress upon us her brilliance.  I really can't say enough good things about her performance, it's that flawless.<br /><br />With a top notch script and excellent acting and direction the film elevates itself into one of the best of the year.  The script for `Hard Candy' was actually conceived after producer David Higgins read reports of Japanese schoolgirls who were ambushing older men who were surfing the web for underage dates.  So this type of thing has happened before.  I highly recommend this film to anyone wanting to watch something separate from the normal media fare.  This is intriguing and entertaining and compelling.  In the end `Hard Candy' tastes utterly amazing.</p></br><a href="../users/A38YUU4J5Q4EJO.html">A38YUU4J5Q4EJO</a><br/><p>I was not expecting this movie to be so GOOD, but was I ever surprised!<br /><br />Excellent acting all the way across the board, too.<br /><br />This story is about the revenge of a young girl, against a pedophile who she believes has taken advantage of young women by raping, molesting, and even murdering one girl.<br /><br />By acting like a young, sweet, and innocent girl in a chat room, she lures this man to his apartment, and once there, and drugged, and with no one around to hear him- The games begin!!!<br /><br />This young girl is such an excellent actress, she had me believing for a minute that this was not a movie!! and the games continue, until the shocking climax of the movie...<br /><br />There is a casteration scene on his kitchen table that you will never forget.<br /><br />Although not the best movie I ever saw, this is way at the top of my list!<br /><br />I have wondered why this movie is called "Hard Candy" and I think it is because, to a pedophile, this young girl is as they say 'Eye candy' - Candy for the eyes, Yet she is wise and tough and hard beyond her years, therefore : Hard Candy.<br /><br />Highly reccomended.</p></br><a href="../users/ATZ1LTONGHOP6.html">ATZ1LTONGHOP6</a><br/><p>"Hard Candy" takes the notion of young girls in chat rooms being the prey of pedophiles and turns it on its head by having a young girl stalking pedophiles in chat rooms. At the start of this film, 14 year old Hayley (Ellen Page) meets up with 30 year old Jeff (Patrick Wilson), a man she met in a chat room, but rather than becoming yet another victim of child abuse, Hayley takes matters into her own hands, and pretty soon it's Jeff who's begging for mercy and not Hayley.<br /><br />"Hard Candy" is not the sort of film you watch for fun. In spite of what you might have read in other reviews, this is not another gore-porn (there is actually very little blood in the film), but from a psychological point of view, it is a difficult movie to watch. While watching this film I saw nothing on screen to make me feel nauseous, and yet at several points I found my hand hovering over the remote because thinking about what was happening, from both characters' points of view, was just too much for me. I'm glad that I did continue, however (for the record, if you can get past a certain scene, that you have probably heard about, in the middle of the film, then you shouldn't have trouble making it to the end), because the ideas raised by this film are very interesting and the concept is possibly the most original that I have heard in a long time.<br /><br />This film is not without faults, however. One of the main drawbacks of this film is that the characters are impossible for an ordinary person to identify with, or to even sympathize with. It's essentially a two-role film and one of those roles is a pedophile and the other a psychopath. A second drawback is that Patrick Wilson's character spends most of the film tied up and he just isn't a good enough actor to pull it off, nor is the dialogue written for him while tied up strong enough for him to hold his own against Page's psycho. A third drawback is that the characters are clich&eacute;s. Jeff is your "typical" pedophile and Hayley is your "typical" victim-turned-aggressor. I found myself comparing this film to "Happiness", another film with a pedophile character, and I found the latter to be the better and the far more disturbing film because in "Happiness", writer Todd Solondz did not fall victim to the clich&eacute;s that "Hard Candy"s writer, Brian Nelson, did.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this film, albeit conditionally. If you think that you can handle the themes, then it's worth watching for the questions it raises, but if the concept isn't your cup of tea, then don't feel bad about giving it a miss, because it's not something that I would class as essential viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GANR9I6XHTU9.html">A2GANR9I6XHTU9</a><br/><p>Hard Candy is what I would call the perfect 'internet' themed suspense movie. The story revolves around Hayley, An intelligent pretty 14 yr old girl who likes to spend most of her time online. One day while surfing the internet, She ends up chatting with Jeff- a man who happens to be 17 years older than she is. After a couple of weeks of chat sessions & flirting they end up deciding to meet at a local coffee shop.<br /><br /> While at the coffee shop they start having discussions. They seem to have an instant bond and relate well with eachother but under the surface there is a subtle uneasiness about it all. We can't really tell what Jeff's motives are and It feels like you're being tricked along with Hayley. Tricked because on first impression this guy seems to have only good intentions. He's handsome, well educated, responsible and seems to have her best interest at heart yet below the surface we think we know what he wants at the same time.<br /><br />After talking awhile, Jeff ends up inviting Hayley to his home with the promise of giving her an MP3 of a concert she's been wanting to see. She ends up going with him but what Jeff dosen't know is Hayley already knows what he wants, has a plan and by the time they get to his house this movie does a 180 on the viewer. After that it turns into a nonstop battle of terror.... A fight till the end between victim and captor ensues filled with interesting twists and suprises.<br /><br />You won't think of the internet the same way again...Also you'll question if some people on the internet arent what they appear to be and what motives they may have. This was a very uncomfortable movie to watch but as far as psychological drama's/thrillers go it was excellent. It's a modern, dark and intelligent thriller that won't disapoint.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>I knew the deal going in, first off.  However, that did not prepare me for the sinister nature of the film--from all sides, for the emotions and thoughts the characters' involvement evoked, or for the lingering creepy psychological impact of the perspectives presented.  Who to sympathise with?  Anyone?  I'm not sure.  Haley was equally as awful as Jeff, though I have to fully admit that at first it was captivating to observe how articulately and eloquently she put it to him.  The self-confessed irony of her character is that she is a little girl not able to do what a woman can.  My thoughts on that were that she did dispassionately what a woman would likely be too emotionally involved to do.  The terror that can be exacted by teenaged girls is no better shown that in this film.<br /><br />There were a lot of intuitive leaps on the sequence of events that did not work for me, and a few holes in Haley's logic.  In order for me to fully buy that Haley was what I was supposed to believe she was, I need to understand how she got there, and that information was missing from the film.  It was alluded to, but not established as part of the story being told.  The risk of omitting that part of the plot did not add mystique but detracted from the believability of that character.  Haley was well-acted, but it seems that her performance was poorly directed or scripted unconvincingly.  This film is certainly one to watch, a thrilled, indeed.  I can't hold it up in the ranks of chick-revenge flicks, but it is certainly now rooted in my psyche.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>A fourteen year old girl, Hayley (Ellen Page), chatting on the internet meets a 32 year old photographer whose moniker is 'lensmaster319', but who's real name is Jeff (Patrick Wilson).  They arrange to meet in a coffee shop called Nighthawks.<br /><br />Hayley is far too wise for her years, and Jeff's feeble attempts to prove himself above picking up on her are washed away in her innocent insistence that he take her to his house to hear a bootleg MP3.  What ensues is a game of cat-and-mouse, but who is the cat and who is the mouse?<br /><br />'Hard Candy' is a psychological thriller, the entirety of the movie taking place between only two people in a singular environment, yet it manages to stay edgy and clever.  The performances are superb, the dialogue flowing and sharp, the script tight and true-to-form.  Even the atmospheric details (such as the obsessively clean house) rang true to profiling.<br /><br />While not a flash-action movie, 'Hard Candy' will still keep you riveted to your seat and your ears cocked toward the screen, wondering just what will happen next and how far the game will go.  Worth a purchase.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This 2005 independent film basically has two characters -- a mature 14-year old girl played by Ellen Page who meets a man through the internet and the man, played by Patrick Wilson, a 32-year old pedophile photographer.<br /><br />There's tension in the air from the beginning and this tension grows and grows as the girl becomes the tormentor and it's the man who the audience feels sorry for.  The acting was sensational although the screenplay was a little slow for my taste.  There are surprises throughout and twists and turns of the plot.  But the main emotions are the girl's cold calculated cruelty and the man's terror.  This is an uncomfortable film to watch but I was fascinated throughout.<br /><br />The film is well done, might even be a prize winner, and, on a certain level, I was fascinated by it even though I hated it.  Therefore, my recommendation is limited to film buffs only and those who not afraid of a film that will make you squirm.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>This is a dramatic pas de deux, unflinching in its intimacy. In the DVD bonus commentaries, the actors and director take exception to the impression some people had that this movie must have been adapted from a stage play. They protest that, to the contrary, this movie is supremely cinematic.<br /><br />I DID think this material looked as if it might have been adapted from a stage play. But to me, that isn't a negative. You get the best of both worlds here. You get the personal immediacy of a play, without a clutter of special effects and extras. But unlike being at a play, you get a telling close-up of the actors' faces. And that's everything in this intense game of cat and mouse.<br /><br />The acting is gripping, although I think that Patrick Wilson looks a little too nice to be a sexual predator. Not that all predators have to look seedy and suspect. But Wilson lacks that glinting, concentrated quality that comes of having a hidden agenda in every encounter. However Ellen Page is brilliant as his intended teenage victim. She blazes with genius, both practical and philosophical, as she counters each one of the predator's self-justifying arguments in turn.<br /><br />The movie looses some logic towards the end. I don't see the inevitability of the end in the same way the characters do. But that's a relatively small flaw in a generally realistically noir film.<br /><br />Neither of the two bonus DVD commentaries is very good. Listening to them tends to detract from the impact of the movie you've just watched. The actors' commentary is slightly better than the writer's. However you probably do need to listen to at least one of these running commentaries in order to pick up on a key point in the movie's action. I, apparently like a lot of viewers, didn't realize a pivotal element in this interplay until it was explained in the commentaries.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Hard Candy (David Slade, 2005)<br /><br />It's odd: I went through the first nine months of 2006 seeing movies that were mediocre to bad, for the most part. Now, within the space of a week and a half, I've seen Advise and Consent, Hard Core Logo, and Hard Candy, and if I were making up a list of the ten best films I saw in 2006, I'd have a very, very hard time choosing one of the three to top it.<br /><br />Now, I should warn you from the outset: this is one of those films that you will either love or hate, probably depending on how you feel about the subject matter itself. It's hard to summarize the plot, or even give the obvious comparisons, without spoilers-- and it should be mentioned here that the advertising campaign for this movie was about as perfect as it gets in its painstaking insistence on not giving a single blessed thing away about this flick while still keeping interest levels high; the final three-quarters of the movie I never saw coming. Bravo to the marketing team (and that's something I almost never say).<br /><br />In any case, the drama here surrounds to characters: photographer Jeff Kohlver (Angels in America's Patrick Wilson) and teen Hayley Stark (X-Men: The Last Stand's Ellen Page). In the opening scene, there's some typical online flirting that leads to a meeting between the two; Jeff is painted as something of a morally ambivalent character from the outset, but nothing here is going to prepare you for what follows-- none of which I can tell you about without spoilers. You'll have to see it for yourself.<br /><br />As I said, it's the subject matter that will cause your reaction to this film, because how the subject matter is handled is absolutely above reproach. Both Wilson and Page play their roles to the hilt without overplaying them (though there are some clever uses of, shall we say, mood-altering substances that allow for some latitude in that regard); the film is written by Brian Nelson, who's penning the script for the upcoming 30 Days of Night, and it's directed by David Slade of Do Geese See God?. Everyone here, with the ironic exception of some of the cameos (Sandra Oh makes a brief appearance) and Page-- who's been in the business for about a decade, having gotten her start in the good TV series Pit Pony back in the day-- is a relative newcomer to this business, and all of them show that they have a very, very good handle on how to make a bang-up movie.<br /><br />The spoiler thing is frustrating, because there are two films to which I'd like to favorably compare this movie, one of them firmly lodged in my top ten favorite films of all time. But, as I keep saying, you'll just have to see it for yourself. It falls squarely into a particular subgenre of thriller that seems to turn out excellent movies whenever it pops up, and Hard Candy is no exception. You will love this film or you will hate it, but either way, you have to admit that the folks who made this movie did one hell of a good job getting you to love it or hate it. This is fantastic stuff. **** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>Good movie... if "good" to you means a movie that commands your attention from start to finish.  It's interesting how one's sympathies shift back and forth between the stylish bachelor photographer (Patrick Wilson) and the young girl (Ellen Page of "Juno").  Of course, viewers' sympathies are never totally with the guy, because at best he's someone who forms disturbing and inappropriate associations with young teens.  And, of course, he might be something much worse.  But that's where one's personal politics come into play: even if the guy turns out to be something even more horrific than a seducer of young girls, does that mean that retaliatory teenage vigilantism, complete with mental and physical torture, is still to be condoned?  The generous extra features confirmed my suspicions that the producers wanted to get a dialogue going on the subject rather than make a bold final statement.  Instead, the boldness comes from the almost non-stop intensity that begins almost at the outset. This is one visceral movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Already praised by some as modern-day fable based on the Little Red Riding Hood story, `Hard Candy' handles its controversial subject matter with tactful direction from the first-time director David Slade. He wisely avoided nudities or too direct descriptions of violence, but still because of exceptionally realistic acting from the two leads Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page, some parts of `Hard Candy' are very disturbing, making some of you feel not a little uncomfortable.<br /><br />In short, `Hard Candy' is a thriller or a tale of a fourteen-year-old girl who does a very bad thing to a middle-aged male who thinks he is a clever guy. It is about Hayley and Jeff, both of whom are seen engage in mind games after chatting on the net and meeting actually each other. You can easily see what Jeff is really thinking about when he meets the `little girl' at the beginning. The point is, the little girl also knows it too, and turns the tables when he asks her to drink something in his room.<br /><br />The rest of the film is about the battles, mental and physical, between these two characters. Except the brief appearance of Sandra Oh and Odessa Rae, the entire scenes are shot with only these two characters and the background about them are slowly revealed during the course of the narrative, which is greatly helped by the skillful camera work of David Slade.<br /><br />There is a surprise or two (depending on how you count) at the end of the film, but I don't think they are necessary. The film begins and develops its story finely with a cautious pace, which renders each scene very realistic, but in the second half the tightly knit settings begin to lose power with implausibility of some events and unaccountable motives of the characters. Like some B-horror films (which `Hard Candy' is not), we have to see someone refuse to do the most reasonable thing when he has to do it. I don't know how you will find it, but I for one thought the too neat conclusion is slightly disappointing because I really loved the film's mind games in its earlier section. Truly wise girl like Hayley would have done something different, more ingenious and original than the things (which I cannot tell here) you see at the end of the film.<br /><br />Whatever your reactions, you will be fascinated (or terrified) by Ellen Page who has really become a 14-year-old girl Hayley whose character easily matches Norman Bates or Hannibal Lector. The difference is she could be so nice and cute, which makes her all the more terrifying.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>Hard Candy is in no way a difficult movie to review because it has almost no flaws. I think everything is perfect and it is now in a very short list of amazing films that is filled with all talk and never bores you. The film is about a 14-year-old girl named Hayley played by Ellen Page. The film goes right into the base of its story when Hayley meets up with a 32 year old man named Jeff whom she met in a chat room. Already you can tell that this girl is a little different from any 14 year old you know.<br /><br />She tries to show Jeff her intelligence right off the bat by using big words and telling him about stuff she learned from books that she reads. He just takes this as her being a teen who thinks she knows it all but you'll find out that she actually does. The entire time that they're chatting in the cafe Jeff doesn't realize that he is the victim and not Hayley. Hayley is sure that Jeff is a pedofile and was involved in a missing child's murder so she uses herself as bait to get inside his home and take over so she can find the evidence she needs.<br /><br />The acting is amazing even though the cast really only consist of two people. The first movie I saw Ellen in was X Men the last stand but the role was so small that I really didn't pay attention to her. Her performance in this is out of this world and she makes this movie what it is. The cinematography was on point, it showed a rugged picture when needed. It had to show the actors fear, frustration, and confusion. I would never think that a story like this could be pulled off but the right cast was picked and it was written and paced perfectly. It may actually remind you of "Phone Booth" or even "SAW" so if your the impatient type and don't like a suspense buildup then this movie might irk you.<br /><br />I have nothing negative to say about this film and how could you when this little girl is doing something that most people could never do. I am sad to see some reviews on Hard Candy from people that see it as a movie with no meaning at all. I understand that it's just a movie and a little farfetched because it's a 14 year old carrying out punishment and trying to bring justice to a girl that could've been herself. I think about parent's who's children have been missing for years and they still don't know where their kids are and how they might wish for a person that would do this. I know it's a fictional story but it still has a moral to it that should stick with everyone. To be honest I'm not even sure if Haley is really 14 in the movie or just looks like one and uses it. Hard Candy is a great movie with a great twist to it that shows a lot of courage and I think it's perfect in every aspect.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this movie. I also watched it with several friends and they all watched and liked it. They did say that it wasn't anything that they expected and they said that it was as equally funny as disturbing. I enjoyed the young girls performance as Haley. He mannerisms were just perfect when she was doing the young girl part. The guy who played the photographer/predator was also very good. It was one of those movies where you just loved seeing this guy who is a real scum get tormented.<br /><br />Good flick</p></br><a href="../users/A3B87UZLPCF0HW.html">A3B87UZLPCF0HW</a><br/><p>This was downright nail biting, anger causing, and made Dateline NBC (catching pediphiles) something that could turn a freakish child molestor into a slobbering idiot.<br />We have Jeff, a photo taking and participant in the loving of little girls. Then we have Haley---she is 14 years old and starts chatting online with Jeff about attraction, photo shots and plain sexual attraction.<br />They get together at Jeff's house (where most of the movie is shot) to begin this cat and mouse, "who can get out of his house alive, with sexual organs still intact."<br />Actually this is Jeff's worst nightmare....Haley wants retribution for a young girl who came up murdered. She believes Jeff was the culprit, or as we find out, part of the duo in the death of this young girl.<br />Haley through the movie manipulates, psuedo tortures and degrades Jeff to the point where he is a blubbering idiot.  Haley's objective....she wants Jeff to hang himself from the roof of his house in front of his former girlfriend and the world, leaving behind all sorts of twisted videos/pics and such, to let the police and the world find out what kind of man he actually was-----a thought in closing---maybe Jeff wasn't that bad???? Maybe Haley should have considered not being Judge, Jury and Executioner---she was one scarey little 14 year old girl throughout the flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>Ellen Page has just made herself a new fan with this movie. It's very rare that you find a movie where you find yourself rooting for the main character the whole time. The only complaint I have is that it did start off kind of boring for about the first 20 minutes when the film just shows them chatting online, and then meeting, and hanging out for a while. However, the fun starts after she drugs him after telling him "Never drink anything you didn't mix yourself" he didn't listen so he woke up tied to a chair. Again, I think that Haley is the hero of every little girl who has been targeted, taken advantage of, stalked, of preyed upon by a pedophile. On the Internet or otherwise. Jeff got everything he deserved, and then some. Don't get me started on the casteration scene...THAT WAS CLASSIC! I had to watch it again just to see him beg. To make this review short, I think you'll really like this movie. It probably become a cult classic later, but for now I think it's one of those films that fell through the cracks.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Occasionally a piece of cinema pushes boundaries and hits its audience with issues pertaining to choice, judgement, and morality. These are the type of films that divide audiences and add heated comments to after dinner discussions. One such film in recent memory was THE WOODSMAN, starring Kevin Bacon, a story about a pedophile trying to integrate himself back into normal society after being released from prison. It pushed us beyond our normal comfort level and forced us to view the world in a somewhat more empathetic manner regarding these people (a pretty uncomfortable thing to even think about). And HARD CANDY asks the viewer similar disturbing questions but ping-pongs us back and forth between doubt and certainty about what's happening between the two main characters..<br /><br />The story opens with two people in a chat room on the internet, typing suggestive comments to each other. A face-to-face meeting is arranged and when the two come together, it is obvious there are issues here: one is a fourteen-year-old girl named Haley and the other is a 32-year-old photographer named Jeff. From the get-go we're uncomfortable with this meeting, as we know that men in Jeff's age-range shouldn't be meddling with a kid. The ante is upped even higher as Haley agrees to go home with Jeff (indeed, she pushes to go home with him). But once at Jeff's place, the tables rapidly turn. Haley is a smart and possibly psychotic young girl. As we delve deeper and deeper into the film, we begin to feel that maybe Jeff was setup somehow. And as Haley begins to knock Jeff down time and again, the audiences allegiances towards her stance are questioned. Should we be cheering for her? Or worried that Jeff may not be a pedophile after all and simply a nice guy?<br /><br />Time and again the tables get turned, and the viewer is constantly wondering which of these two they should be hoping comes out on top.<br /><br />This is one of the most intense films I've seen in a long time. Not since PSYCHO has this amount of a mental impact been felt. The beginning is somewhat slow to get going and many may feel like this is going to be a cliche-riddled movie. It isn't. As I sat on the couch, watching in horror as the stakes went higher and higher, my fianc&eacute; said, "Honey? You're squeezing my hand too hard." I hadn't realized how affected by the movie I'd become until she mentioned this. In fact, several times I held my breath, something that is a cliche in itself, but something I couldn't help.<br /><br />The acting and script for Hard Candy are absolutely superlative. Young Ellen Page (who was eighteen at the time but fits well into the role of a fourteen-year-old) delivers the performance of a lifetime. Her intensity, especially during a set of scenes I like to call "The Home Surgery Mutilation" is so creepy, frightening, and sick, that I actually felt nauseous. Patrick Wilson as Jeff is just as impressive and I felt equally repulsed and worried for him as the minutes ticked by.<br /><br />The movie isn't forcefully bloody or grotesque, either. Its success is owed solely to the interactions of the characters and not, necessarily, what they do to each other. Men, be forewarned, you may have nightmares when you're done watching it.<br /><br />When the flick was over, I felt spent, as if I'd just ran a set of mental hurdles. That's how good this film is.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>David Slade's "Hard Candy" is the last thing I expected on a Saturday afternoon--the smothering, almost unbearable atmosphere of psychological terror rivals some of the best of this genre that I have ever seen, and that includes some of the work of Ingmar Bergman.  This film certainly suffices as society's ultimate artistic revenge on sexual predators and then some.<br /><br />Ellen Page gives the performance of a lifetime as a young woman named Hayley Stark, who for the most part remains a mystery throughout the film.  Luring Jeff (Patrick Wilson), an internet pervert who has a taste for photography and underage girls into a situation that seems ideal for a guy like this, the tables are turned are turned very quickly and predator becomes prey in a brutal fashion.  Hayley drops hints here and there of her absolute contempt for Jeff in the most subtle, teasing ways, but he has absolutely no way of knowing what's coming.<br /><br />Hayley has so many different motives that it gets hard to keep track of amidst all of Jeff's screaming: it seems that she wants to cause him the most grievous psychological and physical pain, remove his manhood and make him feel as docile and impotent as possible in the face of her considerable wrath, and also bring him face to with exactly what he is, allowing him no easy way out--not even death.  At least not immediately.  Her thoroughness and absolute ruthlessness lead one to wonder if Hayley herself is all that balanced.  At no point does she display any emotion but delight in his suffering and enthusiasm for finding new ways to cause it, which she does very well.  She mentions a model who disappeared named Donna Mauer, though when Jeff desperately probes the possibility of a friendship between the two she gives no definitive answer.  She may be anybody--a random sexual abuse victim who decided to go head hunting, indeed a friend of the young model he had a part in killing, or a psychopathic teenager looking for a legitimate moral cause as the the outlet for her rage.  In any case, one cannot sympathize with Jeff; Patrick Wilson portrays him realistically, as a con man who is hollow and perverse at the core.  At one point--while a perceived castration is taking place--Jeff relates a horrific from his childhood to Hayley.  Is it real, or something he made up to generate sympathy?  There's no way of telling.  At any rate, it does not phase Hayley one bit. The black humor here lies mostly in snippets of the dialogue, and you have to laugh loudly because otherwise you can't breathe.  A brilliant, remorseless film and one the best psychological horror films I have ever seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>The film directed by David Slade and written by Brian Nelson seems disturbing enough for just the subject matter alone, but it's also eerie in how timely it's release has been. With reports of teenage girls becoming victims of internet sexual predators appearing in all types of news media, Hard Candy arrives in the theaters through a limited release to highlight this current trend. Slade and Nelson has created an disturbing and, at times, a very uncomfortable film that shows the many twists and turns that happens when the roles of prey and predator become interchangeable.<br /><br />There's no denying that Hard Candy aims to put a new twist on the exploitation subgenre of the rape-revenge films that dominated the late 70's and early 80's. Brian Nelson's clearly channeling the influences from such rape-revenge fantasy films like Mastrosimone's Extremities and the very disturbing and exploitive I Spit On Your Grave (Day of the Woman) by Meir Zarchi. From the beginning the audience is shown the set-up of an adult instant messenging another person with the screen name of Thonggrrl14. Thonggrrl14 is in fact a 14 year-old teenage girl named Hayley and the adult on the other end a 32 year-old photographer named Jeff who goes by the screen name Lensman319. Jeff has an unhealthy and disturbing penchant for pubescent girls as the subject of his camera lens.<br /><br />From their first meeting meeting at a coffee house where Jeff gradually begins a flirtatious conversation with the young Hayley to the point in the first act when he finally convinces her to go back to his house whcih doubles as his studio. There's really no denying the sense of unease that permeates the first act as Hard Candy gradually paints Jeff as the sexual predator that he is. There's no denying the fact that a man of his age should not be flirting and behaving as if the girl across from him is a fully-grown and developed woman of similar age. Hayley also comes across during this first act like a teenage girl dazzled by an older man who treats her older than her real age. It's really a disturbing look at just how easily an adult can seduce a child into doing things they normally shouldn't be doing.<br /><br />Hayley (played by young Canadian actor Ellen Page) soons shows just how wrong and mistaken Jeff has been in picking her as his new prey. I don't use that word loosely for that is what this film truly is when boiled down to its basic component. A one-on-one three-act play (Brian Nelson's experience as a playwright shows in the stage-like sequences from beginning to end) between a predator and prey. This time around the prey has turned out to be the one who has done the hunting and the consequences on the wanna-be predator that is Jeff leads to a slow and deliberate set-up that looks like something out of Takashi Miike's Audition. Hayley's turning the tables on her stalker shows that girls her age are intelligent enough to know that what Jeff is doing is wrong. Hayley's answer to that is to be the hunter instead and fix Jeff's "problem" through what she calls as "preventive maintenance." What she calls "preventive maintenance" is bound to cause many men in the audience to sit very uncomfortably and wince on more than once occassion.<br /><br />The acting job done by Ellen Page (balancing her indie work here with a turn as Kitty Pride in the upcoming X3: The Last Stand) is dazzling and really shows her as an up and coming talent that needs to be watched. She was technically 15 year-old when the film was made and already she showed a keen grasp of the script which deals with disturbing topics. There's a scene in Jeff's car as they reach his home where a passing glance of the camera at her face shows not a gullible teenager, but a determined and somewhat oft-kiltered individual who knows what she will be doing in the coming hours will be medieval harsh but in her mind justified. Patrick Wilson (last seen as Raoul in The Phantom of the Opera)as Jeff plays the would-be sexual predator admirably. His range of emotions go from outright denials of Hayley's accusations to impotent rage and desperation as his fate is described to him in Miike-like detail by his teenage captor.<br /><br />If there's a flaw to mar the intense and suffocating atmosphere this stage-like film creates it would be in the script itself. At times the Hayley character becomes a one-note individual whose beyond her years demeenor seemed to cold and rehearsed. I really can't put the blame for this on Ms. Page, but on the writer himself. It seems like Brian Nelson is trying too hard to add twist and turns on the story being told. He seems to enjoy overmuch his ability to tug back and forth on his audiences' emotional investment in the film and the two characters. He actually pulls off the trick of making the sexual predator earn the audiences' sympathy at what is about to be done to him. But instead of continuing on with that tangent and thus putting Hayley on a darker and more sinister light, Nelson backs off and pulls the audience back to wanting physical and emotional destruction to be visited on Jeff. Nelson used to much zig-zagging in making his script look more complicated than it ought to be. A rape-revenge film works best on its most simplest form.<br /><br />The direction by David Slade (well-known as a music video director) is actually very subdued and deliberate in its pacing. Slade doesn't fall back onto his music video experience with unnecessary quick-cut editing that's plagued his music video director brethren. Slade manages to pull off a very Hitchcockian-style of directing by letting the stage and the actors speak for the scene without much bells and whistles to clutter things. There's a few sequences where he lets the camera film things through one long, continuous take thus adding a sense of realism to the situation developing inside Jeff's home. I was really impressed with Slade's work and looking forward to see what he intends to do to follow-up Hard Candy.<br /><br />The use of too much twists and turns in the script notwithstanding, Hard Candy is a tour de force piece of suspenseful filmmaking that borders on the great psychological horror films of the 70's. In fact, the subject matter on the screen lends a sense of real horror to the film with its timely release and story. Any parent or adult who knows teenagers who use MySpace.com would think hard about wanting to know more of what their kids are doing on the net. Hard Candy can be brutal at times and almost suffocating at others with little or no levity to break the tension. It's a difficult film to sit through and probably won't be the type of films for some, but just watching the performance by Ellen Page is worthy of the price of a ticket. The subject matter is very adult and straddles the line of what constitute a rated R film and one strictly for adults only. Hard Candy definitely falls on the latter. 8.5/10.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>I will admit something up front.  I am a sucker for a tight, clever script where there is plenty of verbal sparring.  Intelligent (might I even say--"thought provoking") drama gets me off.  Two of my favorite classics are "The Lion in Winter" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolff?"--two powerful, but wickedly funny, verbal bloodbaths based on plays.  Now I'm not saying "Hard Candy" falls into that league, but it is certainly refreshing to watch an adult film with an actual point-of-view that doesn't dumb itself down for mass consumption.<br /><br />Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson are both suberb, and there are enough twists and action to keep the viewer guessing through their game of cat-and-mouse.  This is a sweet antidote to the usual summer blockbuster--one that will make you think and one that you will remember.<br /><br />Not to provide a spoiler, but the film does wrap itself up rather tidily--which keeps it from being truly brilliant (I'd actually give it 4 1/2 stars).  But I was riveted throughout.<br /><br />A word of warning, however, I imagine a lot of people might not like this film.  But if you are a fan of well-scripted, well- acted drama and open to the subject matter (might be too controversial or even too graphic for some), I'd definitely give this a try.  KGHarris, 9/06.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>In one of the most beautifully acted films of the year, director David Slade's provocative Hard Candy asks a number of provocative questions: When does the predator become the victim? To what extent is vigilantism justified? And what justifies one person going after such cold-blooded revenge? The film starts out with two anonymous people chatting on the Internet. The repartee is seductive and tantalizing.<br /><br />Fourteen-year-old doll-like Hayley (Ellen Page) offers to meet the older man Jeff (Patrick Wilson) at a coffee shop, where he wipes chocolate from her lip with his finger and continues the predator's dance. Jeff isn't your stereotypical pedophile; he's young, handsome and sexy, and an upwardly mobile fashion photographer. Jeff buys Hayley a coffee and a shirt and they talk about literature and film whilst she tries the shirt on.<br /><br />Hayley proves that she's perky and sweet and way bright beyond her years and soon they are heading back to Jeff's secluded, modernist house deep in the Hollywood Hills. He makes her a vodka and orange and offers up an impromptu photo shoot. Pretty soon we realize that there's something not quite right about this scenario.<br /><br />It turns out that little Hayley isn't as innocent as we thought she was. Without giving too much the plot away, Hayley launches into an unrelenting and sometimes stomach-turning inquest into the older man's secret life as a pervert and a possible murderer. Jeff adamantly denies killing a girl who has recently gone missing, but the innocent Hayley will not be swayed.<br /><br />What makes this film so spectacular is that when the tables are turned, we as the viewer are forced to rethink our sympathies for the predator and the prey and as the boundaries between the good and the bad guy become blurred, we are left with just these two damaged characters in a claustrophobic house where their dangerous cat and mouse dance is gradually played out.<br /><br />Although there is a small - and welcome - appearance from the lovely Sandra Ho as a concerned neighbor, much of the movie is just Page and Wilson, each fighting for the upper hand, which gives the film the look of a tense one-act play. Obviously the actors have to be strong in this type of film and really know their characters, luckily both Page and Wilson indeed rise the occasion.<br /><br />The boyish Page is remarkably confident, as the pixie-faced, scalpel-wielding vigilante and she's really able to imbue the right balance of anger and sympathy. Though Jeff is clearly a sneak and a sleaze from the beginning - he makes no apologies for the fact that he likes little girls and is meeting them on the Web - to his credit Wilson adeptly shades Jeff - giving him a sympathetic and shameful back-story. It's open to question how sleazy he actually is.<br /><br />Hard Candy is Slick and stylish in its writing, direction and design, and as the psychological thriller it works beautifully, mostly on the strength of powerful performances by Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson. Although many have called this film exploitative, because of its provocative subject - pedophilia, the film is powerful and subversive and raises some serious issues about the psyche of men such as this. This is confrontational filmmaking at its best with a dark, daring and bold heart. Mike Leonard September 06.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>This movie is like Open Water, where there are only two actors in a situation that you know something terrifyingly awful is going to occur but you are compelled to watch anyway.  In this one a thirty-something man is trolling the Internet chat rooms looking for young girls.  He has a conversation with a 14 year old girl and they agree to meet.<br /><br />He tells the girl that he is a photographer that does a lot of work for magazines and the girl ends up at his house.  The first thing that the girl notices is there are photos of young girls lining the walls.  He gives her alcohol and she appears to be getting drunk but then the man starts getting ill and passes out.  When he wakes up he is tied to a chair and being interrogated by the girl.  She tries to get him to say something incriminating or help her to locate something incriminating in his house.  As soon as she finds something you know that something bad will happen.  The seamingly innocent 14 year old becomes a calculating vigilante metting out brutal justice.  It is at this point you want to stop the film but you are compelled to continue watching to find out what will happen (even though you already can guess what will happen).<br /><br />If you have a very weak mental constitution, this movie is not for you.  If nothing phases you than you will appreciate the incredible acting and the thrill of the shocking situation that the two are in.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>These actors give fantastic performances in a harrowing story of a young girl who turns vigilante, trying to punish a possible sexual predator.

In "Hard Candy", Ellen Page goes even further, and plays Little Red Riding Hood as a ruthless vigilante on a mission to punish the Big Bad Wolf for his sins.<br /><br />"Hard Candy" is a taut, intelligent, intense thriller that completely ignores the normal clich&eacute;s of victims, predators, villains and vigilantes. Even more impressive is that the entire film is carried by the two superb performances of Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page. Wilson's Jeff is evil and manipulative to be sure, but he also fills the character with plenty of vulnerability, self-loathing and desperation. Page's Hayley is a true revelation: powerful, brilliant and fearless. By the end of the film you're not sure whether she's an avenging angel or a psychopath ... and since the film doesn't ever provide the viewer with any more justification for her actions than Hayley provides Jeff, you're left to draw your own conclusions.

Throughout the movie you are sitting there thinking "who is the victim here?".

The actors are tremendous in basically a 2 person movie with brief appearances by 3 other characters.  I had a hard time believing a 14 year old could be as smart and have a master plan as eloborate as this girl did.

I expected it to be good, but I never expected anything this good. The writing is razor-sharp and the film is completely unpredictable which made it so fiendishly good and enormously entertaining.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: A fourteen-year-old girl named Haley meets a thirty-two-year-old guy named Jeff over the internet and they decide to meet at a restaurant and then decide to go back to his place. He shows her around his home and decides to give her some drinks as well. But Haley turns the tables on Jeff and she drugs him and holds him captive in his own home where she constantly interrogates him and asks him the whereabouts a missing woman whose picture he just so happens to have and what he did the teenage girls he took pictures of. No matter what Jeff does, she always outsmarts him and mocks him in the process.<br />MUSIC: The music for the most part is actually pretty good, and it fit the mood of this psychotic and brilliant horror/thriller very well.<br />ACTING: I really got to hand it to Ellen Page's performance (She was the actress who played Juno), she easily gives the best performance. She was smart, witty with dark humor, and she played the role a psychopath flawlessly. Patrick Wilson (He played Nite Owl in Watchmen) also puts on a great show as a demented pedaphile who is terrified of this girl. For the most part, I can see no flaws in their performances.<br />ACTION: This film is mostly dialogue only. There is very little in terms of violence and almost no blood. I really have to hand it to the writer of this film because the dialogue is sharp and clever and this film was almost never boring (Though there were a few moments in which it was a tad boring). The characters always had something to talk about and keep you on edge the entire time. This film feels very fresh and is completely unpredictable and waiting for what's around the next corner is always exciting.<br />OVERALL: Tired of the usual cliched horror films or thrillers? Hard Candy is the perfect choice for you. This film is a superbly crafted piece that always leaves you on edge and always makes you guess what comes next. You can't say that about other films in this day and age.<br />THE GOOD: Sharply written story and dialogue, good music, and flawless acting.<br />THE BAD: Some moments were a tad boring.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>I knew this film would be brutal, but the level of edge of your seat frightening was unexpected.

A 14-year old, behaving like an adult, emotionally torturing this guy who may a molester, so many things happen in this movie that I wasn't expecting, and there were times you didn't know who to root for. The writer and director took an idea that may have been done before, and throws the audience for a loop. I've never seen a 14 year old girl do something like this-act like an adult, and take the law into her own hands. To me, this film was very original, everything was done very subtly, and sometimes that isn't a bad thing. Rent this film, it's worth it, believe me! It's also worth owning.</p></br><a href="../users/A21VGNU5959O85.html">A21VGNU5959O85</a><br/><p>Hard candy is one of those movies, where you have some *idea* about what it's about, and once you start watching it you quickly realize that you had *no* idea what so ever. You can turn on the TV any given day and see some news station, talk show host or investigative report on child predators. Lately we have all been subjected to the Amber Alerts, Megan's Law, the pictures of the innocent children who we all know are dead, and the new phenomenon on dateline NBC where people pose as children to lure predators to houses than they ambush them, confront them than arrest them. I am sure that the public outcry if not deftly handled by law enforcement would result in many a pedophile being strung up. These men and women, too many people, get off too easily. They have to register as sex offenders, have their pictures on websites and wear ankle bracelets, not a fitting punishment for someone who hurts children for a living.<br /><br />This movie takes that concept of "payback" to a whole new level, and asks *what if the child took the upper hand* What If a 14 year old girl, researches and finds predators, hunts them down and makes them pay? What on earth could she do? The answer is *a lot* Hailey is a smart, precocious, crafty little bundle of vengeance, and it wasn't too far fetched to see her doing what she did. I know a lot of reviewers say it was unrealistic, that no 14 year old is that smart or strong, I would like to point out that maybe their children are just not that way, but there are those out there who are living beyond normal potential. Adrenaline, smart planning, and common sense outweigh age any day.<br /><br />It is a raw and brutal movie, not for the squeamish or faint at heart. At times you are asking yourself if you feel sorry for this man, or if Hailey is the monster, I have to admit in the end I wasn't crying for his loss.<br /><br />I love the instances throughout the movie of<br /><br />--choosing between embarrassment and shame or bodily harm.<br /><br />-- underestimating your prey<br /><br />This isn't a family movie, or a movie to show children what so ever, its not a movie to show the dangers of the computer or stranger danger, it's a movie for adults who have ever enjoyed the "ole switcharoo" scenario.

I did want to see either both going down horribly...or both just walking away.<br /><br />For one to triumph over the other seemed...hard and unsatisfying.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>I love this movie.  No matter how many times I rewatch it, I just want to die from happiness.  Ellen Page is adorable; the camera loves her, her freckles, her perfect nose.  The colors are beautiful in this movie and Patrick Wilson looks like a Mormon AND The Big Bad Wolf, just unforgivably evil like Philip Seymour Hoffman in Doubt.  You just want to go Nun on both of them.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Fourteen-year-old Hayley has been chatting online with Jeff, a 32-year-old photographer.  They meet at Nighthawk's, have some coffee and cake.  Jeff suggests they go back to his place, so he can take pictures of Hayley for his portfolio.  Hayley agrees, and Jeff is delighted...until he realizes that he's bitten off a bit more than he can chew...<br /><br />"Hard Candy" features some of the finest acting and dialogue ever to appear in a horror movie.  Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson are spectacular; you can't take your eyes off them, even in the scenes where you desperately want to look away (and yes, there are a couple).  The humor--there's a surprising amount of it--is appropriately dark; it's the kind of humor where you laugh, then stop once you realize what you're laughing about.  The movie flows along briskly; only two people for most of it, yet you never once get bored.  None of the movie seems extraneous; Sandra Oh's presence isn't at all necessary, yet as director David Slade explains in the extensive making-of featurette, it doesn't matter--everything is made to fit into the movie, so you never really care if it NEEDS to be there or not.<br /><br />I came to "Hard Candy" after reading reviews that praised the hell out of it.  I was skeptical; we all know, a good review doesn't necessarily mean a good movie--I'm sure somebody somewhere called "Coyote Ugly" the best film ever made.  I'm not saying "Hard Candy" is one of the best films ever made, no; but it is certainly one of the best original horror films of the past few years.  In fact, it's such a good horror film that people will deny that it IS a horror film, because the label "horror" has quite a few (unfortunate) negative connotations.  But never fear--"Hard Candy" is an exquisite horror film, and it will terrify you.  And once these fine performances are no longer immediately in front of your eyes, once your disturbed heartbeat has slowed to a more normal pitter-patter, you will have time to think.  And yes, you will think.  Sorry if that prospect frightens you; if so, go elsewhere.  "Hard Candy" is a thinking man's horror movie.  Or, rather, a thinking girl's.  Don't wanna leave the women out--not after watching this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y0HX12MCT6OR.html">A1Y0HX12MCT6OR</a><br/><p>>you're a pedophile<br />>no i'm not<br />>yes you are<br />>ok maybe i am<br />>i'm going to cut your genitals off<br />>you are?<br />>lol jk<br />>ok<br />>but seriously, hang yourself<br />>ok<br /><br />*Theater erupts in applause*</p></br><a href="../users/A18SDN3HYFVH2L.html">A18SDN3HYFVH2L</a><br/><p>There are an awful lot of great movies that have been made about voyeurism, sexual predators, revenge; the careers of Roman Polanski and Michael Haneke among others are testaments to our fascination with the subject.  HARD CANDY goes deeper than most into many of these themes, but sadly falls far short of greatness. There's no way I can say anything much about it without significant SPOILERS, so be warned.<br /><br />Precocious teen Hayley (Ellen Page, quite brilliant) meets much older photographer Jeff (the always excellent Patrick Wilson) in an internet chatroom, and then for real at a coffee shop. It's "meet-cute" with lots of saucy, seductive banter -- mostly on the part of Ellen -- and though it's engagingly filmed (lots of close-ups and interesting cutting in the early scenes, in brightly lit widescreen) it unsettled me, not because of the ickiness factor but because I didn't buy it. I didn't buy for a second that Ellen was going to be a victim, which was fine -- she obviously knows what she's doing, that's believable -- but that led me not to buy that Jeff - who seems just as smart as Ellen, and much more in control of himself than he apparently really is - would go along with it. Is he so wrapped up in his good fortune that he doesn't see her playing him? Perhaps, but the film strives for a lot of realism throughout and this was the first element that didn't work.<br /><br />When they leave the cafe and head to Jeff's somewhat remote hilltop suburban ranch home, the troubles really begin, both for Jeff who is soon to get more than he could possibly have bargained for, and the viewer, who is treated to a higher level of sadism and a more excruciating, drawn out series of psychological tortures than necessary or perhaps possible.  I wonder if the filmmakers were aiming at this point more for the horror film audience than for the serious art-film audience; indeed the whole film seems to be stuck between these two basic kinds of spectators - or notions of spectatorship.<br /><br />The most serious problem for me, ultimately, is that the film once having demonstrated that Ellen is at least a borderline psychopath herself then lets her off the hook by demonizing Jeff in an entirely unambiguous and exploitational way. The end result is that we are supposed to cheer on Ellen as she completes her horrifying but seemingly righteous plan; some will buy that and love it. I didn't, and the terrific performances and interesting film-making choices did not redeem it.  All in all, I'm left with very mixed feelings: on the one hand, there's an intellectual and moral cop-out in the way the characters are handled in the third act; on the other, the visceral outrage and sickening feelings do come through.  I don't know whether to recommend this to anyone or not, really - take that as you will.</p></br><a href="../users/APQ8N1UKS1RDC.html">APQ8N1UKS1RDC</a><br/><p>I did enjoy this movie and recommend it.  Though in truth the ending.....<br />Anyway we start at a Star bucks coffee shop where we the viewers are introduced to a man in his 30's who is meeting a girl for the first time who is 14???  Anyway they chat for 20min getting to further know each other(they have only chatted on-line you see) and the young girl is very aggressive and would REALLY like to see the man's home.  Once inside we see that our male character is a photographer who takes pictures of only women DA-DA-DUN! He makes himself and his guest a drink where upon she smartly declines  And pours it out.  She however makes a drink for him and while he drinks she suggests he takes pictures of her DA-DA-DUN!  While he takes photographs  he starts to black out and eventually faints. Many hours he wakes up to find himself tied and taped to a chair.  He thinks its a game but THE GAME IS OVER!!!  The 14 yr.old girl is looking to find out what kind of guy she has before her and what kind of sicko gets off on 14 yr olds.  She looks desperately through out the house to find evidence and all the while cutting him and slapping him till he tells her.  a hour goes by as she trashes the house with no luck!  She looks and looks when finally she sees again the table with many little rocks on top.  She moves all the rocks and their is a safe!?!  We discover she does have a pedophile on her hands and also something more.  She begins surgery(her father is a doctor you see)and is going to castrate the male so she can pure him of his lust.  This however turns into a cat and mouse game which for me was kind of a let down.  I'd prefer it to stay with the HORROR aspects and leave the crime/drama out the window.  Still this is a good movie with great performances from its two stars and for those who like a twist at the end...This has it.  Do see it and if you are a guy...Hold them...Hold them TIGHT!!!!!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Have you ever seen that internet video of bird getting eaten by the (ninja) turtle?  Or the one where the octopus eats the shark?  In nature, we all have preconceived notions about roles of weakness and strength during confrontation.  The same holds true for humanity, which is why we love an underdog.  Hard Candy flips that concept on its head, sociopathically displaying that the concepts of predator and prey are interchangeable.<br /><br />When Jeff (Patrick Wilson), a 32-year old photographer, begins chatting online with precocious 14-year old Haley (Ellen Page), the interaction has every indication of something creepy; the situation is just wrong.  When they meet up for coffee, an uneasiness exudes from every table, chair, and fiber of their surroundings.  After some conversation in which Haley displays a maturity and intellect rivaling Jeff, the two make their way back to Jeff's apartment; it's difficult to ascertain who persuades whom.<br /><br />Foreboding and disturbing, the setting quickly illustrates how easily an adult could take advantage of a child; and when alcohol becomes involved, it becomes very clear that despite Jeff's seemingly clean-cut image, he definitely fits the mold of a pedophile.  Little does anyone know that young Haley is not quite as vulnerable as first impressions indicate.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is a battle of minds and will-power, as Haley transforms into a scalpel-slinging psycho, while Jeff attempts at psychobabble only dig his hole deeper and deeper.  The emotional range each displays is mesmerizing.  Haley's actions grow more and more sadistic; at more than one point she admits to being insane.  Meanwhile, Jeff ping-pongs between bleak denial, hopeless sorrow, and fiery rage while under the tormenting teenager's control.<br /><br />Amidst exploitation, asphyxiation, and castration, Haley's glee dances on Jeff's growing despair, and the audience must attempt to weigh the merits of vigilante justice against its inevitable depravity.  Whereas Miike's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000640S9">Audition</a> treated it as an afterthought, the justification for Haley's actions is a common theme in the dialogue - but only a small part of the overall captivating script.  The suspenseful, mental sparring, where Jeff's witty pleading is consistently met with clever repartees from the erudite Haley, is something to behold.  The pacing, camera-work, and directing are minimal, accentuating the feeling of isolation, heightening the psychological maze slowly woven between the two characters - who are responsible for carrying 99% of the movie - and allowing for the exposure of countless emotional layers.<br /><br />This is the epitome if what psycho-thriller should be.  It's clearly the Americanized version - not nearly as much build-up, and quite a bit more "interaction" - of Audition, and aside from a questionable resolution (better choices are available for Jeff), it's highly recommended...on an empty stomach.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4.html">A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4</a><br/><p>I've seen this movie twice so far and it's even better the second time around.  There's lots of foreshadowing in the beginning of the movie that was fun to notice again -- the "missing child" poster at the cafe, the playful questioning each other if faces can lie, and the toast where they announce they're going to "take it all".<br /><br />There's definitely a creepiness factor in this movie.  The movie starts out with a close-up of a computer screen and you see two people sending very sexy instant messages to each other.  You get the feeling that one person is a young teenager while the other is a much older adult.  When the two decide to meet at a cafe, your worst fears are confirmed.  A 30 something male is meeting a 14 year old girl.  ICK.<br /><br />Ellen Page was perfectly cast for this role because she has such a baby face and small physique.  As an audience member, you feel protective of her as she flirts lolita-style with him at the cafe.  Other details that highlight how small she is add to the creepiness of what this man is doing -- like when he buys her a shirt in size small or when she puts on his very large jacket.<br /><br />There are two main themes I noticed in this movie.  One theme is innocence.  An obvious example is that she's young, but there's also the innocence of guilt.  Throughout the film, the man, no matter what he does, keeps insisting to himself that he is a decent, good man.  The story he tells in the kitchen also pulls at your heartstrings a bit.  This movie definitely messes with you!<br /><br />Another theme has to do with deception.  As mentioned before, there was the deception of faces lying, but there's also the deception of the internet.  When you go on the internet, you can transform into anyone you want to be...but how honest is that image?  Also revealed are the deceptive means pedophiles use to lure their victims as well as the deceptive means victims use to free themselves from their captors.<br /><br />I was impressed with the imagery in this film.  I just like little details here and there, like the way the window blinds moved, kind of like the shutter of a camera.  A real good scene was when he stabbed the photo of a young woman he photographed...but most telling was WHERE on the picture he stabbed her.<br />I also like the scene that's the first turning point in the film.  He's sitting on the couch, the scene goes a little blurry and you see something you're not quite sure if you saw right...and then the plot twist comes and you're taken on an edge-of-your-seat roller coaster ride.<br /><br />The audience will need to practice some suspension of disbelief to enjoy this movie and if they can do that, this movie won't disappoint.  The performances are fair on Ellen Page's part (she tends to overact in some parts) and excellent on the male lead's part.  I was extremely impressed with his performance.<br />Overall, loved this diabolical, clever and twistedly funny movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A139ZF7CJVVTJU.html">A139ZF7CJVVTJU</a><br/><p>I'm going to make this review as straight-forward as possible.  It might be asking to much to hope that most people will judge it based on its content, and not on whether or not they agree with the ratings I've chosen.  It's probably safe to assume that a large number of readers will already know what they think of these films, in which case I'd suggest you read this review to get another's opinion.  If you haven't seen either of these films, however, I guarantee you that you'll have a good idea of which of these movies you'll be most likely to enjoy.<br /><br />This review will concern two movies -- THE WOODSMAN and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GI3KGC">Hard Candy</a> -- both of which focus exclusively on the very thorny, very divisive topic of child molestation/pedophilia.<br /><br />Before I get into the films themselves, I'd like to make one thing crystal clear: there is nothing funny about child molestation.  It is a horrible crime, and there are no scenarios in which it is acceptable in any way, shape, or form.  As a survivor of child molestation, I have a first-hand understanding of the kinds of repercussions caused by this incredibly heinous act.  And please don't misunderstand.  I do NOT say this to garner pity or sympathy, nor do I seek to represent myself as the voice of all molestation victims everywhere.  Hardly.  It has taken me a long time to get to the point where I can say this with simple acknowledgement, as a way of framing my opinions with a basic and necessary fact that has colored my experiences with love, sex, romance, and relationships my entire life.<br /><br />My opinion, in a nutshell:  THE WOODSMAN is a good film, because it manages to get the audience to sympathize with the pedophile.  HARD CANDY is a horrible film for the exact same reason.  How can this be?  It's because the first film is about forgiveness and redemption, and the second film is about unadulterated hate and vengeance.  Speaking as someone who use to embrace hate, I can tell you that HARD CANDY's philosophies -- popular and easily digestible though they may be -- are counterproductive and destructive.  Older and wiser now, THE WOODSMAN's philosophies may be much harder to stomach, but they are the way the world is, or rather, should be.<br /><br />HARD CANDY is a disgusting film.  The talented <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YABYLA">Ellen Page</a> plays Hayley Stark, a girl who is being pursued by Jeff, our resident pedophile.  After Jeff conives to get Hayley back to his house, it becomes clear that Hayley is not your typical 14-year-old.  From this point on, Hayley tortures Jeff relentlessly while they engage in repetitive and predictable dialogue about his crimes.  Hayley appears to have the wits of a Harvard grad and the strength and agility of a quarterback, because she ensares and releases and ensares Jeff in a series of elaborate torments without breaking a sweat.  This movie is very, very much a revenge fantasy, and that is all it is.<br /><br />When I was young, and lying in bed, I used to imagine similar fantasies, and all they did was prolong my own recovery process.  I've heard dozens of different explanations for the film's premise and goals, but the end game is this: this movie is obviously about turning the tables.  Unfortunately, when you turn the tables, what you get is a young girl who behaves with the confident viciousness of a child molester, and a child molester who flails about, as confused, hurt, and distraught as a child.  Jeff is a horrible person, which is why I was so disturbed to find myself kind of wishing he would win out over the insufferably pompous and stone-hearted Hayley.  This movie contains no subtlety, no surprises, and nothing beyond its surface level viciousness.<br /><br />THE WOODSMAN, on the other hand, shows the consequences of such viciousness.  Kevin Bacon plays Walter, a convicted child molester who is desperately trying to be a normal person.  Unlike HARD CANDY's endless rants, this film has very little dialogue, but world's more heart and wisdom.  Walter is a damaged man, but he knows he's damaged, and the movie explores the possibility that people can change, can finally deserve forgiveness.  There are a few very difficult scenes in THE WOODSMAN -- scenes I found myself gritting my teeth at -- but they provided very clear answers.  How can anyone change if they cannot forgive themselves?  And how can anyone forgive themselves if the world refuses to forgive them, too?<br /><br />As someone who struggled with forgiveness, trust me, I understand the desire to label such people with easy monikers like "monster" or "sicko," but I also know that those kinds of labels are just another way of avoiding the agonizing calculus of penance divided by resentment.  Actually, one of the labels I used -- sicko -- is fairly apt, because this film shows how Walter is less a villain who uses his urges to destroy than he is another human being who is destroyed by something he longs to be rid of.  In spite of the film's probative pace, it's quiet stance, the movie feels remarkably short (when it was done, it felt like thirty minutes had passed, instead of ninety), and although I felt like it could have gone into a bit more depth with some of its questions, it did do exactly what it set out to do, no more and no less.<br /><br />I give HARD CANDY one star, THE WOODSMAN four.  If you're wondering which one you might enjoy, ask yourself the following question: which philosophy do you most agree with...<br /><br />"An eye for an eye..." (HARD CANDY)<br />"...makes the whole world blind."  (THE WOODSMAN)</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>I don't know what I was expecting, but it certainly wasn't this. A taut, sometimes difficult to believe tale about a pedophile who has the tables turned on him...at first, that is. The director did an excellent job of keeping the camera directly on the actors, literally in their faces, and the dialogue was strong, quick, and intense. It's very easy to root for someone giving a pedophile their "due", even if the vigilante in question is a bit off her nut. Then again, I imagine that most vigilantes are off their nut.<br /><br />Ellen Page - as everyone has said - was remarkable. I didn't know that she was eighteen when I was watching it, so that made her performance more riveting.<br /><br />A little background into her motivation would have been nice, but it certainly wasn't necessary.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Wow. Talk about puttin' someone on ice! In Hard Candy Ellen Page (Hayley) puts Patrick Wilson's character (Jeff) on ice in the figurative and literal sense of the phrase.<br /><br />Page is young looking enough to play 14 year old Hayley who takes vigilantism to a tortuous level in Hard Candy. Page was actually 18 when Hard Candy was released. But Page's character has a major flaw: it's one of those characters that is completely unbelievable...you know, super-intellect for a teenager with (seemingly) superpowers.<br /><br />Director David Slade, a directorial youngster himself, could have made a much more realistic movie if he had just made his diabolical leading lady equally vindictive but a little more naive. Instead, Page's character Hayley comes across as a 30-something year old with a Masters in English Debate that's been through boot camp. Simply far fetched.<br /><br />Patrick Wilson (memorable for his 2004 film version performance in Phantom of the Opera) saves the film from unrealistic disaster as relatively believable in his role as 32 year old underage-girl-lover Jeff.<br /><br />Page and Wilson occupy the screen for 98% of the movie. The dialogue between the two is fast and keeps you watching. The torture is mostly left to the viewer's imagination; Hard Candy is not a bloody movie. It's a movie about revenge that is designed to stir the debate over the definition of who constitutes a criminal...the villain?...the vigilante?...or both?<br /><br />Overall, I was entertained. My wife's summation: "Where do you find these movies?"<br /><br />Hard Candy is fair rental if you've seen everything else that you want to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A153NZD2WZN5S3.html">A153NZD2WZN5S3</a><br/><p>What makes this movie to be a movie as I see, is the astonishing performing by actors. Ellen Page plays a BEAUTIFUL and unrealistically nonhuman fourteen year old teen as her counterpart is a some sort of a modern lust-filled well-earning computer-literal photo-master.<br /><br />This surrealism covers the entire story where semi-performed sadistic approach by a gal seeking the revenge for a killed friend, which is castration, did not distract a male villain-victim himself from energetic resistance, resulted in a triumph of the good over evil anyway.<br /><br />It is definitely not a "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000065UGS">Boy Meets Girl [Region 2</a>]" my review of did not appear on these pages yet for misunderstandable reasons, and it's far away from "Hostel" or "Wolf Creek", but rather a psychological drama leaving a room to suggestion what an animal the supposedly just-simply-emancipated-nowadays girl herself is.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>It's a real shame that Ellen Page's performance will most likely be overlooked come Oscar time since her portrayal of young not-so-innocent Haley is completely and utterly brilliant.  This is the performance that the academy should really sink their teeth into but for some reason I highly doubt that'll happen.<br /><br />Haley is fourteen.  Jeff is thirty-two.  For three weeks they have been communicating in online chat rooms and finally they are going to meet for coffee.  When they do meet they realize that neither is what the other expected.  Jeff is a handsome and intelligent photographer, and Haley is extremely mature for her young age, a borderline medical student.  After some persuasion of Haley's part Jeff takes her back to his place for some drinks and maybe an impromptu photo session.<br /><br />Halfway through that photo session thinks turn ugly, and when Jeff wakes up he realizes that not only is Haley is mature...she's also insane.  The remainder of the film is a complete mind game between Haley and Jeff, Haley seeking revenge for the young girls he's abused and Jeff trying his hardest to get free.<br /><br />The film is brilliantly directed by David Slade, every frame holding and air of desperation and claustrophobia.  Add to that the tension between Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page and you have one of the most intense and gripping films I've seen in a long time.  The performances by these two are really the biggest key to making this film work for when they are the only people you see for almost two hours they can either draw you in or repel you.  I was drawn in, completely.<br /><br />As disturbing as some scenes can be (there's one scene in particular that would make any man squirm) the film is so engrossing the atrocity is easily forgiven.  `Hard Candy' is probably the best film I've seen yet this year, completely original and mind bending as it is brilliantly executed and completely entertaining from beginning to end.  Thanks to a smart script, brilliant plot and utterly amazing acting from the two leads we have been delivered `Hard Candy'.<br /><br />Page inhibits her character with enough confidence and maturity that she is absorbing in everyway, and Patrick switches back and forth through fear and aggression so well that you almost (I stress the word almost) feel bad for him.  Oh yeah, and the final frames of this film is so incredibly powerful and emotionally driven that you have no choice but to be completely engrossed and, for lack of a better word, touching.  The bottom line is that this film creates the perfect detour from modern-day mediocrity and delivers us one heck of a, dare I say, joyride.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JTD6D79HNA5X.html">A2JTD6D79HNA5X</a><br/><p>I think this movie made Ellen Page. Now she seems to be in everything. Either way, we can all relate to this plot. We all chatted with people on the internet and 9 out of 10 met with them in person and did we don't want to know. This is a twist of real life. The young girl is not so inoccent and digs the truth out of the older guy. The long castrate torture scene got a little boring but that's the only complaint i have. I love this movie. Snatched it up the moment i found it at the store.</p></br><a href="../users/A5A2QE6NECFR5.html">A5A2QE6NECFR5</a><br/><p>Patrick Wilson, and even more so, Ellen Page, do wonderful performances in this VERY unpleasant drama about psychic and physical torture. I know nothing about Miss Page, except that she has "it" on screen, and I am not talking about sex appeal. The movie goes on too long, and its ending is unsatisfying, since the motive for the Page character's activities is tossed off with a few words and no explanation as to how the whole series of events came to unfold. The director's choices of black screen transitions between scenes gets annoying as well. The reason for seeing this is to watch what I presume is the beginning of a great career for Ellen, and one more piece of quality work for Patrick, whom I enjoyed greatly in both "The Alamo" and in "Phantom of the Opera." But if you are squeamish about danger, tension, and degradation, skip this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Though I'm still not sure the ending works, I am sure that for the majority of its running length Hard Candy is a tense and interesting 2-character thriller with excellent acting by the leads.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>A Death and the Maiden or Extremities for the pedophile generation.  This still packs a punch, however.  Wilson and Page are both great in this vicious cat-and-mouse thriller about a supposed pedophile and a young girl.  Some very tense, squirm-inducing scenes and some sly direction come together for this satisfying thriller.  Madonna and Guy Ritchie at play?</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>This movie is a fantastic tangled web of emotional mystery and twists. I won't ruin it, but the story started out being what I thought was a 'kidnap' tale with an older man hurting a young girl, but it has a surprise in store for the viewer. In Act I, you are not going to be sure who to feel sorry for. Hang in there, the story unravels in emotion and action that made my husband 'squirm' (slight giggle there). I pictured guys on the set doing the same during this particular scene. The web of lies is taken apart and we know who is the true victim in the end. Movie is very well done, but I was miffed about one particular item I feel should've been answered as far as the question of a 'missing girl'. In my opinion, this loose end should've been tied up and the location of the dead girl should've been revealed. Just my opinion. However, this is a tense thriller with a lot of great dialogue and valid points made in it. Had me saying 'you tell 'em sister', more than once.  Ellen Page is simply one of the most talented young actresses out there!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/A1X15AQVSCKKRG.html">A1X15AQVSCKKRG</a><br/><p>That's what the film boils down to. Whenever I hear the words "amazing" and "great" about a movie I know that's either bogus, or highly exaggerated. "Hard Candy" fell in the middle of this. I thought it was a good movie but overrated.<br /><br />The plot isn't original nor are the characters. One victim or crusader targets a sick pedophile who she suspects of abducting, sexually abusing young girls and probably killing one.<br /><br />However, her crusade with the pedophile is more of an obsession, a sick obsession. How sick we find out in the movie (castration, hanging, even planting evidence).<br /><br />Like I said revenge flicks aren't anything new and so right there my grade for this movie dropped of a bit. Also some people described this as a cat and mouse game but I disagree. While there one or two scenes where Jeff gets away,  we all know he won't. The film is totally dominated by Hayley (Ellen Page) too much to the point where I wasn't surprised by anything. With the story around Jeff,hey could have played around more with him being innocent especially (as they did briefly during the end). It would have made for a better twist seeing the victim actually be worse than the sicko. They did do this for first thirty minutes but then forego the idea for a lot of simulated torture instead.<br /><br />Now on to the performance they were great no doubt. Ellen Page dominates the screen and she really comes across as veteran here. Patrick Wilson was great as Jeff. The directing by David Slade was good.<br /><br />Again this is a good movie but for me it's hardly amazing. It's also one of those films that  for me, I'll watch one but it would hardly come up in conversation. I would have given it more praise had their been a different twist and more done with "the what if" question of whether he is or isn't a pedophile like in superb movie "Revenge" with Joan Collins.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>I had always been fascinated by Canadian actress Ellen Page, because she's very good, and she's by far one of the best actresses  of her generation. I wasn't not prepared to see her in such a nasty role, and I had assumed that she was playing a victim in this movie, at least she pretended to be. No wonder they put her in a red hoodie for the poster. This movie is shot mostly in a house and there is very few characters, even Sandra Oh had just one scene, still very striking. I don't want to reveal much about the story, but it's very disturbing for the second half when Patrick Wilson gets trapped by Ellen Page's game. It's kind of a psychological version torture movies like Hostel, but it's very disturbing and shocking without the blood and gore. Anyways, for a movie that relys mostly on the performance of two actors and one set, and no wardrobe change, and mostly dialogue driven plot, it's excellent! I must say that while this is possibly a star-making vehicle for Page, it also showcased a brilliant performance from Wilson, who by the way impressed my so much.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>The topic of pedophile has been revisited once again; following the recent slew of similarly-themed shows like the `Woodsman' and `Mysterious Skin.' But this time round, pedophile isn't the theme of the show; it is simply a cat-and-mouse-ish thriller between a teenage girl and a suspected pedophile. This movie is dark; hell, what story about pedophile wouldn't be, and the acting is nothing short of excellent. Both characters are extremely convincing and both shock in their respective ways. Brian Nelson's intelligent script is abound with surprising twists, dark humor and bitter exchanges which will provoke discussions among viewers.<br /><br />Hayley (Ellen Page) is convincing as the teenage girl with a vigilante agenda, and Jeff (ambiguous Patrick Wilson) is good as well. The characters that they portray just don't seem to be very realistic in this film. A teenage girl endangering her life into a pedophiles house just to expose his dark secret? This film also features some truly disturbing scenes but nothing explicit. The flaw that I have with this film is that I'm not sure exactly who the makers wanted us to root for, because the girl is portrayed as mildly unhinged and explicitly psychotic, while the alleged pedophile comes across as the victim. Surely if he's the bad guy, we want the girl to succeed and to truly torment him, but in this film we are forced to side with the pedophile which is quite disturbing to me.<br /><br />However, overlooking this is the simple fact that for the performances alone and the quality of the considered direction giving us some heart-pounding suspense. `Hard Candy' is a fine piece of cinema that offers a great deal in comparison to other movies produced nowadays and deserves a view.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>HARD CANDY is one of those films that took enormous courage on the part of the writer (Brian Nelson), director (David Slade), and producers - let alone the actors - to bring a tale of pedophilia to the mainstream audience.  Made for a small budget (yet the production values are so very artistic that it feels like an expensive film), HARD CANDY is essentially a duet for two actors: the actors Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson deliver performances that become indelibly burned on the mind of the viewer.<br /><br />32-year old photographer Jeff has been chatting online with 14-year old Haley for three weeks using standard chatroom seduction lines.  They meet, talk, seem to get along well - until Haley invites herself to Jeff's home, much against Jeff's better judgment.  Once home the beautiful space in which Jeff lives (the set decor is splendid, using sensitive colors in a cinematic way), the walls adorned with photographs of young models, seems a fitting space for a fine photographer.  But soon the twist of the story explodes and Haley lets Jeff know that she is there to punish him for his pedophilia and for some specific events in his history.  She drugs him, and when he awakens Jeff is the captive, forced to undergo the intensive questioning and innuendoes from Haley, including being set up for castration.  The tension mounts to a peak as the two characters uncover aspects of each other; the final resolution of the long encounter comes as a stunning surprise.<br /><br />The quality of the film is so fine that no judgments are made: is Jeff truly a criminal pedophile?, is Haley insane?, can this reversal of roles happen?  The script is so beautifully written that it remains intelligent and straight, forcing the viewer to become involved in the quest for truth.  Ellen Page delivers a brilliant performance as Haley and Patrick Wilson steps out of his usual milk toast roles to create a man driven by strange needs who gradually comes to a point of self acceptance in one of the more powerful scenes of film this viewer has seen.<br /><br />The audience for this examination of pedophilia may be small and therein lies the pity. This is a film that deals with a tough subject so very well that the viewer gains an understanding into dysfunctional characteristics while being caught up in a suspenseful thriller of a story.  This is independent film making at its best.  Grady Harp, September 06</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Hard Candy is a really tricky suspense. You see it starts off rather bland and predictable for the first 20 minutes as a young girl (played by the wonderfully underrated Ellen Page) meets up with a guy she's been communicating with online, then...<br /><br />The plot *completely* changes and becomes much much better.<br /><br />She's convinced the guy has been touching children inappropriately and even taking pictures of them and hiding the pictures somewhere around the house.  Ellen Page's character then goes totally ballistic. Okay I kind of made an unintentional joke using the word "ballistic". I swear I didn't realize that until after I said it.<br /><br />I really don't want to spoil the storyline unlike a few other reviewers below who made no effort whatsoever to hide what eventually happens, so be VERY CAREFUL reading the reviews below mine.<br /><br />Let's just say, the man who plays the 32-year old perverted photographer is absolutely stupid and constantly falls victim to Page's antics.  There's definitely a handful of unrealistic moments, but who cares.<br /><br />The acting is phenomenal, and Ellen Page truly proves exactly WHY she's so deserving of lead role whether she's performing in comedies (Juno) or suspenseful, shocking films like this one. Any other female playing lead role wouldn't have been nearly as effective.<br /><br />Edge of your seat suspense at its very finest. Hardy Candy is a really good, and dare I say, *original* type of suspense. Usually it's a crazy, murderous guy chasing the girl around playing mind games and being incredibly cruel, NOT the other way around. The plot is wonderful and suspenseful. A must see.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>[Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.]<br /><br />***BEWARE SPOILERS***<br />***If you read this before seeing the movie, the movie will not be as interesting***<br /><br />This is a taunt drama of the man bites dog sort in which a precocious 14-year-old girl Hayley (Ellen Page, who was so delightful in Juno (2007)) has her way with photographer Jeff Kohlver (Patrick Wilson) a 32-year-old sickie who specializes in under aged girls.  And her way is...well, way extreme.  But apparently she has cause.<br /><br />The vibrant tension that glues us to our seats can only be resolved by finding out if she is right in her accusations or if he is an innocent victim.  She is certain.  But director David Slade (using a diabolical script from Brian Nelson) keeps us guessing.  Hayley seems not merely precocious intellectually, but emotionally more like a grown woman than a 14-year-old.  Jeff appears to be a sweet, clever guy any girl would love to love.  But she has anything but love in mind.  Her scheme of vengeance is well thought out and very well executed.  Everything is a twist on the Internet chat room stalker scenario.  Instead of the older dude seducing, drugging and taking advantage of the young girl, the young girl turns the tables on him in a horrifying way.  What is it that should happen to guys who take advantage of under-aged girls? They should have their ...s cut off.  That is exactly what Hayley has in mind.<br /><br />Or so it seems.  Actually, although she says at one point that death is too good for him, she finally settles on getting him to commit suicide.  But will he?<br /><br />I was hoping that Nelson and Slade would have the nerve to really turn the tables and make Hayley the villain and Jeff the innocent victim, and it seems for perhaps three-quarters of the film that this is still possible.  We learn that he does have a thing for under aged girls and that is not good, but it isn't enough to justify what he is going through and will go through.  And Hayley seems to be some kind of monster with a sick desire of her own.  But this all washes out when we discover that no he didn't actually kill the girl.  No, he only--as he confesses--FILMED the killing.  (Nice touch, that.)  And no Hayley does not go through with her Third Reich surgery (although she has brought along a blue surgeon's gown for the operation and has donned it).  That would make her just too, too unsavory.  Instead she uses her wiles and her physical and psychological control to get him to jump off a roof with a rope around his neck.  (Yes, I warned you about spoilers.)<br /><br />I mention all these essential details because I want to make a point.  This is a seduction of the audience film and a kind of black comedy that isn't funny until perhaps you see it for the second or third time--which I am not planning to do.  It is absurd in the slasher/horror film manner in which gross human behavior is depicted for the titillation of the audience while maintaining a politically correct stance.  A politically incorrect stance would have been to end the film with Jeff innocent and Hayley the sickie.  I suspect this film would have met with boycotts from women's groups had Slade done that.<br /><br />Still the violence is mostly imagined or alluded to.  Slade eschews any blood splattering or outright torture.  The balls in the garbage disposal are, after all, only in our imagination.  And Jeff really does deserve his fate.  However there is no getting around the fact that Hayley is not your everyday 14-year-old.  I don't think any future suitor would feel comfortable with her knowing what she did to Jeff, evil as he is.  In other words, her brand of vigilante justice could only come from somebody who was a bit sick herself.<br /><br />I think what mesmerized me most about this exercise in fantasy revenge wish fulfillment was the performance of Ellen Page.  I thought she was a bit creepy but very effective.  She actually could have passed for a 14-year-old (she was 18 when the film was released) yet the words put in her mouth and the actions she performed were well beyond the reach of the vast majority of fourteen year olds.  The intense close ups of her face and that of her co-star Patrick Wilson helped to make the characters larger than life, which is one of the things that film can do so very well.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Who is this 14yo girl? She calls herself Hayley, but who is she really? I do not know. Once you see HARD CANDY you'll understand what I mean. I have some theories ranging from the simple to the downright supernatural. Hayley (played by the remarkable Ellen Page) is a true enigma. As the story unfolds, we slowly find out what drives her. We are astounded by her intelligence and single-minded approach. I myself, was charmed, then utterly creeped out by this kid! Throughout the whole ordeal, I kept thinking about movies like AUDITION or EXTREMITIES. Only HARD CANDY is far more disturbing in that it threatens to shatter taboos. I didn't know where this movie was taking me, and I didn't like the feeling of uneasiness and helplessness I felt. Now, that's good horror! If you've heard that HC is "controversial", don't let that stand in your way. This movie is as tense a thriller as I've seen in a while, w/ elements that made me squirm like an eel w/ a nervous disorder! If you enjoy character-driven horror dealing w/ "controversial" (there's that word again) subject matter, then HARD CANDY should certainly satisfy. Buy immediately...</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>"Hard Candy" has an interesting premise that could've made a great movie. Instead, it makes a riveting and O.K. movie. With a total of 5 actors and only 2 with significant roles, the movie is set up more as a stage play than a film...It's almost like a rehashing of Roman Polanski's "Death and the Maiden." Ironically, there's a reference to Polanski in the film. Looking at the cover of the movie you see "Two Thumbs Up" and "Riveting & Terrifying."<br /><br />All these are fairly accurate descriptions, but I still think the subject matter could've been handled a lot better. Hayley (Ellen Page, "X-Men: The Last Stand") is a 14-year old girl who has spent two weeks chatting with a guy named Jeff (Patrick Wilson) over the internet. Jeff is thirty and from what we gather in the opening sequence, a little creepy. Hayley suggests they meet, Jeff agrees. They meet at a coffee shop, playfully flirt, and pretty soon Hayley is at Jeff's house drinking screwdrivers. Then, Jeff collapses and wakes up tied to a chair. Hayley, you see, is under the impression that Jeff is a pedophile (which he no doubt it) and also a murderer...Of her friend. The filmmakers present the characters; Hayley never elaborates just how close she was to this girl, but to go to the lengths she does...They must've been pretty close. The movie clocks out at about 100 minutes; 85 minutes focuses on Hayley torturing Jeff, both physically and mentally. Problem is...What she does is pretty predictable. During the "torture" scene, I knew what was really going on and her final speech to Jeff at the end of the film sounds like it was plagarized from every other film with a vaguely simalar subject matter (Who am I? I'm every girl you've...). The movie does have it's high points though. It does create suspense well, sometimes keeping you on the edge of your seat. Most people won't notice this, but the opening scenes are pretty brilliant. If you listen to the way the two characters are speaking with each other, it sounds as if each of them is choosing their words carefully as to not scare the other person off. The end of the film is built up too much for it to be any surprise, but when the film ended...I questioned something? In this film, Jeff is supposed to be the villain. While watching the movie though, I couldn't help noticing that it's Hayley who seems to be playing the evil character. We never see Jeff do anything violent, unless it's in self-defense. Hayley seems like an insane, sadistic little girl. If this film does nothing else, it should jumpstart the careers of the two leads. It takes a lot for two characters to carry a movie and the two do the best job they can with the script. It's a good movie, don't get me wrong. It's just really nothing special.<br /><br />GRADE: B-</p></br><a href="../users/A1PL8JA0TEHBVN.html">A1PL8JA0TEHBVN</a><br/><p>The story is simple:<br /><br />An innocent looking 14 year old girl meets an older photographer on the internet and agrees to go to his house. It looks like he is the child molester and she his next helpless victim. But think again... this girl is the big bad wolf!!!<br /><br />Everything on this film is great. The story, the actors, the setting, dialogs, etc...<br /><br />It is worth every penny to see that old Hitchcockian clich&eacute; (few characters closed inside a small place) working so well.<br /><br />The weaker part (for me) is the ending. I found it predictable and a little contrived - that's why I take one star out.<br /><br />But even if you agree with me, this film is still a winner in many many ways... The cast is a joy to watch. Ellen Page gives a stunning performance. She is a powerhouse actress... see it because she is unbelievable!!!<br /><br />This film is, in fact, a great lesson on how do you make a great film with very little means and lots of talent and imagination.<br /><br />It has also a heavy subject and some strong/violent content that you must see before recomending.<br /><br />I'm happy I cought it on the movie theatre. And i must say I was impressed and surprised by the film's best qualities - that overshadowed its shortcomings.<br /><br />A strong film to be discovered on DVD.<br /><br />I love Sandra Oh... I wish her part was bigger.</p></br><a href="../users/A2P2JXU9JEYNV3.html">A2P2JXU9JEYNV3</a><br/><p>This film was totally unbelievable on more than a few counts. The man didn't actually DO anything to this "little girl", and the "torture" she puts him through is akin to a felony!<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong, I am a Mother of four, a Grandmother of two, and a Great-Grandmother of another four, and I believe very strongly in the protection of children against Child Molesters, but c'mon, this poor guy just did not deserve what he got. To be pushed to what amounts to suicide? What about the "little girl"? How on Earth did she become such a master manipulator? What was her home life like? She learned this stuff somewhere.<br /><br />All of us moviegoers are essentially "Voyeurs", and what I witnessed was a crime! This was NOT a case of child molestation. This was a case of Torture, resulting in death (read:MURDER, in the first degree)! I realize that there was a message to this film, and I'm in NO WAY defending child molesters, but this film sends the wrong message. If the makers of this film wanted another "Death Wish", why wasn't it labeled as such? The man was only guilty in the little girls' mind (whether or not he was, is never proved).<br /><br />American Society has become paranoid. The result of this paranoia is a hypersensitivity to situations that haven't happened yet (I call it the "what-if" syndrome). This film is a prime example of the syndrome. The man may have been guilty in thought, but not deed. Do we now become the "Thought Police"?!<br /><br />The DVD had the usual extra features, and the playback is very good.</p></br></body></html>

Some work such as the confrontation that Dr. Manhattan faces by reporters on a TV show while others such as the murder of an important supporting character suffers from weak dialogue and acting by the extras.<br /><br />There are some minor artifacts but on the whole the film looks stunning on Blu-ray. The special features are quite nice introducing a unique one in particularly called "Maximum Movie Mode" that you quickly get the feeling will be over or misused by others. In "Maximum Movie Mode" you director Snyder appears on screen during certain scenes detailing how the scene was shot. You can also access production photos/comic book pages for a comparison/contrast between how the film was storyboarded vs. the final outcome. You can also see the actual shooting of the scene while watching it again be aware however that this isn't presented in a picture-in-picture mode. It does interrupt the film but you can quickly navigate back to the film itself. There's also an alternate "Timeline" with photos comparing our world to the world of "Watchmen". It's  marvelous special feature that could only be presented in Blu-ray because of the higher bit rate/capacity of the format.<br /><br />***<br />The rest of the special features are located on disc two. We get a number of very good featurettes on the film itself from "The Phenomenon: The Comic That Changed Comics" which points out many of the innovative techniques, use of subtext and layering of the various stories that Moore & Gibbons used to present "Watchmen" back in the 80's to "Real Super Heroes, Real Vigilantes" which explores how the characters are mirrored in real life in our world.<br /><br />"Mechanics: Technologies of a Fantastic World" allows you to dig into the technology of "Watchmen" ranging from Dr. Manhattan's Martian get-away to Nite Owl's ship. We also get the 11 "Watchmen" video journals which were originally on-line as well as the video for the song "Desolation Row" by My Chemical Romance. There are also BD-Live features planned for the future. You can share many of your favorite special features via BD-Live through Facebook. Some of this material is a bit repetitive because of the visual commentary track that Snyder does.<br /><br />We also get a third disc with a digital copy of the film and the code which is active for a limited time."Watchmen" had a long and painful birth--it went through director's, writers and producers more rapidly than a kid eating a candy bar.It's the 1980's and Richard Nixon serves out his third term as President. The U.S.won the Vietnam War due to the intervention of superhero Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup)and the other superheroes now banned by the government from intervening in the affairs of ordinary folks. When the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)is murdered the vigilante hero Rorschah (Jackie Earl Haley in a marvelous performance)as he tries to discover who is trying to eliminate America's former heroes. He contacts his old partners Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson), Silk Spectre II aka Jupiter (Malin Akerman) and Ozymandis (Matthew Goode) to convince them that they need to band together to discover who wants to eliminate them.<br /><br />"Watchmen" may be flawed but Snyder's ambitious film overcomes many of those flaws by introducing a fascinating story filled with colorful, conflicted characters. One of the flaws of the film are some of the surface, shallow performances by the actors and part of that can be laid at the feet of director Snyder and his writers on the film. While many of them can't dig in underneath the surface of these characters and expose what's truly going, others such as Jackie Earle Haley, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Patrick Wilson, Carla Gugino as Silk Spectre's mother Sally Jupiter and Crudup as Dr. Manhattan reveal a significant amount of what drives their characters. Part of the issue is the film format itself which allows limited time and space to portray the same story that was told over many issues of the original comic book itself and part of that is that Snyder becomes so enamored with his visuals that he loses track of the very human element he's trying to portray. Still, flaws and all I doubt anyone else could have tackled "Watcmen" and succeeded as well as he has here. Producer Joel Silver who had the rights to produce an earlier version of the film (which would have starred Arnold) recently commented that he felt his version would be a better version of the film, more populist reaching a broader audience. What he fails to realize is that is precisely what would have watered down and ruined what was unique about "Watchmen". The fact that Snyder makes a relatively faithful, visually epic that nicely captures the flavor of the graphic novel IS an outstanding achievement worth noting regardless of the flaws.<br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AFFVUZEGP1FDQ.html">AFFVUZEGP1FDQ</a><br/><p>Wow. What an amazing movie. Watchmen is based on the serial comic of the same name. The story was perfectly and faithfully transferred into film. The film even feels like a comic book and I can remember each picture in the book.<br /><br />What if superheroes and masked vigilantes were involved in the World's most crucial events (Vietnam war, the Cold War, etc.)? The story follows a group of heroes as they try to discover who murdered one of them, The Comedian, and why. It has been prohibited for heroes to use their powers and with the threat of an oncoming nuclear war, they have to make a decision and try to prevent it (circa US 1985).<br /><br />The art direction, special effects were amazing. The fight scenes were graphic and amazingly filmed. Although it is long (2 h 45 mins), I hardly felt it as I was too engrossed in the movie.<br /><br />Billy Crudup gives his character, Dr. Manhattan, the perfect detached  personality that questions whether he has any remaining human proclivities. He was amazing in his performance and so were the other actors. The movie centers around the idea of humanity, hope and the loss of both. The heroes face the decision as to what has to be sacrificed to save the spiraling human race from itself.<br /><br />This is a bold movie, an amazing movie, a must see movie. This was a gorgeous movie. It was an experience to see it. I must see it again. Very graphic (violence and nudity).</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>It's strange entering a movie theater, having no idea what to expect from the film about to be seen. The ads for "Watchmen" promised a visually stunning superhero movie, and while it certainly delivers in that respect, I never imagined that it would also be such a complex, thought-provoking morality play, one that takes plenty of time to develop the characters into people we can actually invest in. I suppose I could have known this ahead of time had I read the original graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, but to tell the truth, I didn't even know of its existence until the summer of 2008. No matter--the film is a work of art unto itself, not merely in terms of its look, but also in terms of its attention to character and its willingness to tackle weighty political and social issues. The tradeoff is a plot that's often very difficult to follow, mostly because, at a hefty 163 minutes, there's a lot of story being told.<br /><br />It's a story that takes place in New York City in 1985. Not the actual 1985, mind you, but a 1985 in an alternate reality, one in which Richard Nixon has just been elected for a fifth term as President. Even though superheroes are commonplace, they're all mere human beings, which is to say that they have no actual superpowers. At a time when the United States and the Soviet Union are engaged in a heated nuclear battle, superheroes, also known as Watchmen, are seen more as vigilantes, and it isn't long before their actions are outlawed. Despite having disappeared from the public eye, it seems there's a conspiracy against the Watchmen, who are now being murdered one by one. Kick starting the story is the murder of Edward Blake, a.k.a., The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan); this reunites the remaining Watchmen, who take it upon themselves to solve the mystery of his death.<br /><br />Most of the film is built around in-depth character analyses, which gradually help to explain why these people are the way they are. The Comedian, for example, is so named because, from his perspective, life is all one big joke. Having been commissioned by the American government to assist in certain operations, he's cynical and world-weary, pretty much to the point of hostility. It would be too much to say that we're made to care for him; we see him do some pretty reprehensible things, none of which I'll describe. We are, however, made to understand where he's coming from. At a certain point, he finds that he's no longer laughing at how much of a joke life is.<br /><br />There are many other characters. There's Laurie Juspeczyk, a.k.a., Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman), whose troubled mother, the original Silk Spectre (Carla Gugino), had ... an encounter with The Comedian many years ago. There's Daniel Dreiberg/Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), a technically savvy retired superhero, whose "basement" is an abandoned subway station filled with various machines. There's Walter Kovacs/Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), the only Watchman to continue his pursuit of vigilante justice. Appropriately, his cloth mask is decorated with inkblots that continuously shift around, and as is the case with a real Rorschach test, he sees only what he wants to see in the world around him. There's Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), the only Watchman who has publicly revealed his identity. It's said on a few occasions that he's the world's smartest man.<br /><br />The most fascinating character is Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), the only Watchman who has actual superpowers. His story is definitely one for the comic books; he began life as mild-mannered nuclear scientist Dr. Jon Osterman, but as the result of a lab accident, his body and mind were transformed, allowing him to exist beyond mortal notions of space and time. His voice is distinctly human, but his body is a glowing-blue spectacle made of light and energy. Even though he uses his abilities to assist the American government in its efforts against the Soviet Union, it's obvious that he has drifted apart from the rest of humanity. It's easy to see why--joining with the very fabric of the universe must make life as we know it seem awfully insignificant. He makes this point on the surface of Mars, where he unearths a towering sphere of crystalline gears, all of which rotate in very clock-like patterns.<br /><br />And yet, there's the sense that some part of him, however small, is still human. Consider the fact that, even though he appears mostly in the nude, he always dresses in a suit for important events, like press interviews. How is it that a being from another plane of existence would have even a modicum of humility?<br /><br />As we near the end of the film, an ethical dilemma is presented, challenging the audience as well as the characters. What it basically boils down to is: Is there a point at which peace comes at too high a cost? You be the judge. All I can say is that it's a fitting question for a film this well crafted, not merely on a technical level, but on a narrative level, as well. It's an ambitious superhero fable that surges with action, drama, and humor, at times brutally violent, at times contemplative, always staying fresh and exciting. It's always risky making a film adaptation, and admittedly, I was worried that "Watchmen" would follow in the footsteps of films like "Silent Hill," which was only understood and appreciated by fans of the original video game. Speaking as someone who hasn't read the graphic novel, I'm happy to say that "Watchmen" is not elitist entertainment. Not bad for something that was once considered unfilmable.</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>There is a lot of Superhero action in this movie. The who-dun-it aspect is simple to figure out. What really bogs the movie down is the stiff acting by everyone and the ever constant heavy themes of blurring good and evil. I ask you, can the Watchmen really be good guys if they allow Nixon to become president 5 terms and disco music to survive?<br /><br />The movie does a poor job of introducing the characters. You are fed a pseudo history of the US with Watchmen during the opening credits. Once Bob Dylan is done playing, the movie starts and you are confused who the characters are. The relationship of the characters and their past deeds are relayed through flashback scenes, which in many cases were more interesting than the rest of the movie. The lack of character introduction wasn't as bad as "Final Fantasy VII" movie, but it is worse than what Tolkien did to us.<br /><br />The Superheros, a vigilante group who murder women and children for their country (an early good/evil blur) are semi-retired as wearing masks became outlawed. Someone is killing off the Superheros and superhero Rorschach is the most determined to find out.<br /><br />Dr. Manhattan (big blue guy, clothes optional)can't see into his future and has assumed we have annihilated each other. Meanwhile, Nixon and Kissinger are in the war room, in a scene which reminds us of Dr. Strangelove. They are debating a first strike.<br /><br />If you like your superhero action mixed in with pseudo history, political statements, blurred good/evil themes/ atheist statements (The watch has no watch maker), and the slinky Silk Spectre being zipped out of her costume (some nudity) then this movie is for you.<br /><br />If you like good acting, a well written chronological story, good dialogue, and a need to know the characters, and film editors past the third grade- go elsewhere.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>Geez, it looks like in April we will be getting the official "Watchmen: The 'This is really the final cut, I'm serious guys' Cut". Or so I thought. I am a huge fan of the Watchmen universe- I read the graphic novel twice, I saw the movie on opening night at the theatre, I bought the Director's Cut on Blu-Ray when it got released. Then I went and bought this when it got released. Greed getting the best of me, I think so.<br /><br />I was pretty damn amazed when I saw it in the theater. Then when I got it on Blu-Ray, I felt like I had seen a totally different movie (in a good way) with it being the director's cut- It had better pacing, an extra 23 minutes to tie the loose ends, and in the end it was a satisfaction. And then I got this.<br /><br />For one, the packaging is nice and lovely to hold and look at, and to disassemble it is exciting too, just like when the director's cut of Sin City got released back in 2005, which came with the graphic novel, which was a nice little classy touch. However, in terms of content, this is nothing new. It is essentially the director's cut with "Tales of the Black Freighter" shoved in there.<br /><br />The problem with it is that it's just unnecessary. TOTBF does nothing but just extends its length, and not in a good way. The movie was already long enough with the 3 hour 6 minute Director's cut. The runtime of the Ultimate Cut is 212 minutes, almost an hour longer than the theatre cut. And the TOTBF just creates an awkward transition from the movie scenes to the animated scenes. Every time the TOTBF scenes come in, they take you out of the movie, thus makeing it hard to enjoy.<br /><br />Another problem is that the TOTBF scenes ruin any ambiguity there is to Veidt's plan. It basically tells whoever hasn't seen the movie and is watching it for the first time that Veidt's plan is doomed to fail- that he will murder 15 million people and try to cover it up by making Dr. Manhattan look responsible. It also tries to spoonfeed the "good versus evil" cliche to kids under 12 watching the movie. Rorschach good! Veidt bad! The comic let you decide who's good/bad, yet the UC spoonfeeds it to you.<br /><br />Picture quality is amazing (and I am speaking for both the DC and the UC here since they both have the same picture quality); I remember when The Dark Knight came out on blu-ray and people were oh-so-swayed by its supposedly amazing picture quality yet I couldn't get my mind past the failed attempts to recapture the IMAX scenes, the distracting edge enhancement and the shifting F-stop in some scenes. Whereas Watchmen looks vintage and sharp- a lovely film grain enhances the 80s feel of the movie, the colors are really vibrant (especially in the Dr. Manhattan scenes and Laurie's coat in the "Forest room" interrogation scenes). The Audio is fantastic too- though not different than the DC.<br /><br />In short, it is worth purchasing, but for the packaging only.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>When the long-awaited adaptation of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' comic book masterpiece Watchmen was released, it proved to be, despite its flaws, undoubtedly the best adaptation that a fan of the comic could have ever hoped for. Those who found it boring, overlong, or just simply didn't "get it" need not apply here for this Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut edition, which pushes Zack Snyder's adaptation to a 3 and a half hour plus epic. Fully incorporating the animated Tales of the Black Freighter (intercut into segments) as well as deleted scenes from the first DVD and Blu-Ray releases of the film, Watchmen: The Ultimate Edition is a masterpiece of comic book to film adaptations that will not disappoint those who have long cherished the comic. The special features, which include commentary tracks from Snyder and Gibbons, as well as the brilliant Under the Hood segment, the various webisodes, and the Watchmen: The Complete Motion Comic, are worthwhile enough (though one may wish that more would and could have been included features wise), and as for the film itself, the same flaws do remain: including the various alterations in the story (such as Rorschach's origin and the ending), and the fact that the film just isn't for everyone or those expecting to see guys in tights fighting the good fight. Despite its flaws though, the Watchmen film remains a labor of love that does Moore and Gibbons' masterwork, and now that it's in its complete form, is more than worth your time.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>When the long-awaited adaptation of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' comic book masterpiece Watchmen was released, it proved to be, despite its flaws, undoubtedly the best adaptation that a fan of the comic could have ever hoped for.

However, for you first time readers I have posted the original review of the movie along with my review of the Ultimate collection.<br /><br />The comic book has now officially become the mainstream in the world of film. The major companies try to get their hands on every franchise they possibly can. The real question is once there is a movie in play how will translate to the big screen and who is the fan base? Well, we all have seen what `The Dark Knight' and `Spider-Man' have done. Still, what about the no so main stream novels such as `300'? There are directors out there that don't want to make a movie in their own vision, but yet they wish to bring the book to the screen word for word, page for page. That is the film 'Watchmen'.<br /><br />'Watchmen' may be the biggest cult fan based comic book of all time. Written in an alternate reality in the 1980s, the Cold War is very much alive and all of Earth is extremely concerned about nuclear war. The heroes in this world are not ones special abilities or powers, and they are not liked by the people. Though, the costumed crusaders prevail to keep the people in line and keep order in the world. Suddenly one of them is brutally murdered and they are now the ones who fear extinction.<br /><br />I made it my business to make sure I read the graphic novel before I went to see this film and it was a wise choice. This movie no doubt tried to remain as faithful to the comic as possible. The dialogue was melancholy, they characters were well cast and while there were not as many effects as a major comic book blockbuster it was still put together in a very artsy package. Though, this movie is truly not for the mainstream movie goers. Watchmen was definitely created with the true comic book fan in mind. The director Zack Snyder like on his previous work with `300' wanted to make a movie that was just as authentic as the pages it was first concocted upon. Those who read this story would definitely enjoy it even though it is a very slow movie dragged out story. There are a few major things that are changed for cinematic purposes, but after reading this story I believe that the changes made really made the story more believable and less confusing. The changing of the costumes was a positive thing because some of those characters really looked like pimped out hood ornaments in print. The actors chosen were not well known which a great thing is always. They each filled their roles perfectly and it really made me feel like the comic book was actually coming to life before my eyes. I believe that if you read the book definitely pick the movie up. If you are an innovative person who wants to see something different then you might enjoy it as well. But, I think if you are looking for the typical action super-hero flick let this one pass you by, you might not understand it. Alan Moore may have officially removed himself from any film that his work was to become, but I believe he needs to see this one, because it really has done him justice. Watchmen came out at the right time because Zack Snyder got it right.<br /><br />Apparently I was not on target when I originally wrote my review, because now we have a 5 DVD Watchmen extravaganza. I have to say for one movie on its' own I have never seen such a package. This edition has everything that was made in honor of this film even dating before the movie itself was officially released in theaters! Before the movie came out where two animated films made for DVD release. The animated creation of `Tales of The Black Freighter', which is an essential piece to the Watchmen story. The special feature on that DVD included `Tales From Under the Hood'. In the graphic novel itself you see excerpts of that book and for DVD it is reinvented to be a television documentary complete with effects that make it look aged and its own advertisements. The other DVD release was `Watchmen: The Complete Motion Comic'. This was the graphic novel page for page narrated like a book on tape making the original comic book art look as if it was jumping right off the page. Thanks to this new Ultimate collectors edition these two projects are woven in to the film to make it more true to the novel and really give this film the honor and respect it deserves. Other features include the official video journals and incredible documentaries and commentary not to mention a digital copy of the original theatrical release. How can you possibly pass up purchasing this amazing DVD package? This package has it all...I am serious there is nothing missing from this film now! If you loved this movie you are going to love it even more when you officially have the complete story.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>I'll say this right now: I don't like Zack Snyder as a director and I admit I outright laughed when I saw the trailer proclaming him as a "visionary director". No, the likes of Spielberg, Kurosawa, Scorsese and Kubrick are visionaries, Snyder is at best serviceable in making likable movies but completely off the mark as much as it succeeds. I am probably one of the few guys that outright hated "300" so I wasn't exactly looking forward to "Watchmen" and I'll admit on first viewing I didn't like it. But unlike "300", somehow Watchmen got better on second viewing and while I still have issues with it, it at least shows Snyder improving as a director; it's just unfortunate he wasn't at his A game when he made this one.<br /><br />It's 1985 unlike the one we had where President Nixon is enjoying his 5th term as president and the world ticks ever-so-closer to nuclear war, shown visually by the Doomsday Clock, which inches gradually to midnight. Helping out the city were the Watchmen, a group of costumed superheroes who were then outlawed or put under government control by the government after protesting of vigilantism. But when the Comedian, a.k.a Edward Blake, is murdered, attention now comes back to the Watchmen as they try to figure out who murdered the Comedian as well as if they have the capability to halt the impending nuclear war.<br /><br />A lot of director's cuts are usually extended to either provide an alternate version of the film, a kind of optional "if you want to" version where it doesn't really add or subtract from the film but gives you an alternate take on the movie like Terminator 2 or Alien whereas most of the time this is the director's preferred cut; the one they wanted to make that got sidelined thanks to intervening executives. With the "Watchmen" and its director's cut, one can actually see that a better movie was hiding underneath than what we got theatrically as scenes are aloud to breathe a lot more, things are fleshed out and the overall pacing, while still a long movie (hair above 3 hours), is at least a little more likable. However, that still leaves things a little awkward in terms of the whole where pieces of the movie work really well like the jailbreak scene and the assassination attempt on Ozymandias and yet things in the middle just kind of feel "there" and never really connect or add to the movie's flow.<br /><br />As far as the casting is concerned, it's a bit inconsistent. Arguably, the best thing Snyder did on the movie was casting Jackie Earle Haley as the seriously messed up Rorschach and now it's hard to picture that character or read the graphic novel without his voice and performance being remembered. In many ways he's the best thing about the movie and I'd even go as far as saying it's similar to the great performance Heath Ledger did as the Joker. (Might even have my new Halloween costume, HA!) As for everyone else, well Jeffrey Dean Morgan makes a good lasting impression with what little screen time he has and Carla Cugino has the first Silk Spectre is good as well and yet I found Billy Crudup's voice as Dr. Manhattan to be, well, more like bored or lazy than detached and unemotional and the should-be awkward and poor shaped Nite Owl is instead played by handsome looking Patrick Wilson so unlike say the X-Men movies where there was barely a miscasting, here it's like one works but somebody else doesn't fit the bill.<br /><br />One thing that Watchmen does do is look rather stunning in Blu-Ray and many times I was like "wow, now that's impressive" and many scenes such as the crashing of glass at the end of the movie, a late-movie explosion and even the detail on Rorschach's mask where you can see the strands and thread is quite outstanding. However when you look at the way the film was shot well, this is Snyder we're talking about and the words "slow motion" will frequently come to mind. It's clearly a style-over-substance tactic he's using and he does severely overkill it at times but the clarity on the Blu-ray transfer at least makes it look cool. Also note that this is a particularly violent film and there's quite a few parts that'll make you go "ooooh...." in wincing.<br /><br />For those of you who are wondering, there is a bigger edition coming out in December which will include most likely an even longer cut and other things in the package which is not surprising considering "300" just came out with its, what, Blu-ray release? But as a movie I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this; now I have to go watch "Zodiac" again and make sure my tastes haven't been diluted with time.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>Watchmen, the film based on the novel of the same name, is one hell of a movie.<br /><br />The film, like the book, tells the story of a super-hero world where there's only one that's super and not that many that are heroic. It's an alternate 1985, where America won the Vietnam War thanks to Doctor Manhattan, the only one of the Watchmen with super powers, and where Richard Nixon was elected to a fifth term. Vigilantes are banned, but that doesn't stop the disturbed, and disturbing, Rorschach, a masked crusader who read Ayn Rand and didn't get the joke.<br /><br />The movie begins with the murder of the Comedian, a former masked hero and US government operative. Rorshach begins investigating that and quickly starts to think there's more than meets the eye, and that someone's out to get the former heroes. Along with his only friend, Nite Owl II, he starts uncovering what might be the largest conspiracy ever.<br /><br />The film is a visual feast of immense proportions (rather like Doctor Manhattan's penis, which you'll see more of than you wanted). The sights up on the screen, particularly on Mars, are stunning, and the effects are nearly perfect, even the most mundane ones. There's a couple shots that I would've sworn were filmed in New York City (the movie was shot in Vancouver).<br /><br />The acting is just as good, especially by Jackie Earle Haley was Rorschach. He's got the voice and the manerisms down pat from the comic. The other roles are rounded out just as well, even those that are people impersonating real historical figures (though Nixon's nose was way too long).<br /><br />As for the script, it was quite good, and though, yes, the ending is changed from the graphic novel, it keeps the overall theme intact and, frankly, works better than the giant squid thingy.<br /><br />Overall this was a very good movie, though not for everyone. Do yourself a favor and go see it while it is still in theatres, cause it will suffer greatly on the small screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>Based on Alan Moore's graphic novel, 2009's "Watchmen" takes place in an alternative 1985 where Nixon is serving his fifth term and costumed vigilantism is illegal. A former masked crime-fighter named The Comedian is murdered, provoking his previous teammates to investigate the crime. Things get complicated as the backstories of most of the Watchmen are revealed and worldwide nuclear war looms.<br /><br />For some reason I was never interested in the Watchmen and therefore never read the graphic novel, even though I had the opportunity. Why? The fact that it took place in an alternative reality turned me off, as did the peculiarities of the team members, which Moore intended as satire. That said, I really appreciated this movie. "Watchmen" is an adult-oriented superhero flick with a convoluted plot, strong characters and total originality. The latter two score high marks with me any day.<br /><br />Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) stands out with his gravelly voice and extreme right-wing ideology, although he's not very likable. He's impressive yet, at the same time, kind of pathetic. The character was based on Steve Ditko's The Question.<br /><br />The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) exudes great charisma and is reminiscent of The Punisher, if he were a jokester. Unfortunately, The Comedian's arrogant & hotheaded and has a weakness towards the ladies, not to mention cold-blooded murder.<br /><br />Night Owl (Patrick Wilson) is another strong character, obviously based on Batman or Blue Beetle. Unlike the previous two he's very likable. I always thought his costume looked really lame in the graphic novel but, as depicted in the film, it kicks axx.<br /><br />Dr. Manhattan (Greg Plitt), named for the Manhattan Project and based on Captain Atom, is an almost God-like being who can do pretty much anything. He's so detached from the human experience that he walks around totally nude and has no time for his woman, Silk Spectre II. He'd rather hang out on Mars, literally!<br /><br />Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) stands out due to her sexy costume more than anything else, not to mention Akerman's drop-dead-gorgeous looks. The character was based on Phantom Lady and Black Canary. Silk can't handle Dr. Manhattan's increasing aloofness and consequently diverts to Night Owl for human warmth.<br /><br />Silk Spectre (Carla Gugino), Silk Spectre II's mother, has a pretty significant part and, like her daughter, is very hot, albeit in a whole different way.<br /><br />Ozzyosbourne, whoops, I mean Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) is the least developed character and loosely based on Charlton Comic's Thunderbolt. He's ultra-smart, fast and kind of foppish, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The film's long, dark, mature, dialogue-driven and convoluted, but the strong characters and originality win the day. No moronic "blockbuster" trash here. Not to mention Silk Spectre II and her mother are extremely easy on the eyes. As far as superhero flicks go, there's really nothing else like "Watchmen;" it's even more atypical than the X-Men.<br /><br />RUNTIME: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029NY9YO">Watchmen (Theatrical Cut) (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)</a>: 162 minutes; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QTXM5Y">Watchmen (Director's Cut)</a>: 186 minutes; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Q9VPFM">Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut</a>: 215 minutes<br /><br />COMPARING CUTS: I own both the theatrical cut and Director's Cut. Although the theatrical version is just fine, the DC is worthwhile for extended dialogue to existing scenes in the theatrical cut; the biggest addition is an attack on Night Owl's Mentor, Hollis Mason, at the hands of a thug gang and Night Owl's subsequent brutal revenge at a bar. Despite the convoluted plot, I had no problem following the story in the theatrical cut, even though I've never read the graphic novel. The filmmakers did an excellent job cutting out the fat in the theatrical version, so to speak. So don't think you'll need to purchase the DC to understand the story; it's not necessary. My recommendation is to check out the theatrical version first and only purchase the DC if the theatrical cut left you wanting even more, which is what it did for me.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Very rarely does a movie come out that challenges all the quintessential themes of a specific genre.  In all other comic book or graphic novel adaptations, there is a seamlessness with which the transition to film takes place.  The stories translate, the characters remain relatively untouched.  Normally, everything follows the lead of previous editions.  Prepare for that lazy, albeit typically enjoyable, method of delivery to be flipped on its head.<br /><br />The plot is almost stereotypically hero versus villain.  The bad guys come up with an ingenious plan, and the good guys eventually prevail.  Amazingly, however, the dismally dark portrayal of heroes, and the glossy veneer of villains, flips convention on its head.  In a world that has eschewed superheroes and driven them into hiding, a believable life alteration is necessary - this is NOT Superman simply putting on glasses and becoming Clark Kent.<br /><br />The casting and acting for The Watchmen is infallibly perfect.  Each character delivers the overall purpose and essence of their character with flair and subtlety.<br /><br />Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) is perfect in his role as a Batman in Dockers.  The most at peace with his forced retirement, he's old fashioned, and looks like a chemistry professor.<br /><br />Malin Akerman's Silk Spectre was a tad boring, but overall she conveyed the true meaning of the character, the sultry, cute, vulnerable superhero following in her mother's footsteps.  Carla Gugino is an aged crime-fighter who misses the old days and reminisces through her daughter.  Fans of her performance in Sin City will not be surprised by the Gugino flashback sequences in which she blisters the screens.<br /><br />The Comedian is perhaps the darkest of all heroes ever imagined.  He's vile yet he fights on the "good" side.  Completely comfortable with the "break an egg to make an omelette"-philosophy, he blurs the line between black and white, and could easily be seen as protagonist as well as sociopathic antagonist.<br /><br />Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) is a very compelling mastermind.  He believes his purpose is just, so his outward intentions do not come off as foreboding.  His choirboy looks only enforce the fact that he believes in his twisted intentions to save the world.  I'm unsure if the character's name is inspired by the poem, but the connection between each person's perception of invincibility, and eventual demise, is what creates each character's legacy.  In many ways Ozymandias could be viewed as The Comedian on a much grander scale.<br /><br />Jackie Earle Haley's performance as Rorschach is absolutely one of my favorite performances of all time.  His brutal, madman form of justice is more enjoyable than DeNiro's character in Taxi Driver, more misanthropic towards contemporary culture than Col. Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, and a better comic transformation than Ledger's Joker.  It's amazing to think that the pipsqueak from Bad News Bears could be so convincingly rugged, so disturbed.<br /><br />The one major flaw to this movie is the fact that Dr. Manhattan's digitally designed genitalia is on-screen roughly 50 times.  It's completely unnecessary and distracting.  Otherwise, I loved this movie; it's monumental, exciting, action-packed, and meaningful.  I highly recommend this movie for not only comic book fans, but anyone interested in an incredible story told through the lens of stunning cinematography.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N5XIM9R2OQH0.html">A3N5XIM9R2OQH0</a><br/><p>After years of superhero/comic book/graphic novel adaptations that promised big things but fell just short of their marks (I'm looking your way, "The Dark Knight"), Zack Snyder's awe-inspiring adaptation of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons's "Watchmen" has finally delivered the goods: a truly epic film version of a beloved comics institution that expands on the source material without compromising its vision.  While definitely not for the squeamish or short of attention span (or for the small child someone decided to bring to the theater where I saw it), "Watchmen" is still one of the few Hollywood products of the past few years that manage to be thoughtful and entertaining at the same time.  In a move that breaks with pretty much every other comic/graphic novel adaptation to come out this decade, "Watchmen" is set squarely in the real world, or at least in one possible version of it, and the actions of its protagonists don't take place in a fictional city or a vacuum but against a Cold War backdrop of paranoia, fear-mongering, and the looming threat of global annihilation.  The plot leaps back and forth and time and sprawls in all sorts of directions, with violent confrontations sharing space with quieter, more reflective moments, but Snyder manages to keep things moving inexorably forward and maintain tight control of a sizeable ensemble cast throughout.<br /><br />For fans of the book, the setup of the movie should be instantly familiar: the year is 1985, Nixon is still president following the abolition of term limits, the U.S. and the Soviets are at the brink of mutually assured destruction in the face of a showdown over Afghanistan, and costumed heroes have been chased underground following a popular backlash and a governmental ban on their activities.  More important than the similarities in plot, though, is Snyder's shocking level of success in transplanting the world of the book onto the big screen.  While certain aspects of the story naturally had to be excised, the bleak, uncompromising worldview and moral complexity of Moore and Gibbons's book has made it to the screen almost fully intact.  Where Snyder's last directorial effort, "300," was generally simplistic, humorless, and excessive, "Watchmen" by contrast is ambiguous, challenging, darkly comic, and never overreliant on its uniformly excellent special effects.  Some of the fight scenes are a little overly stylized and implausible (though again nowhere as annoyingly so as in "300"), but given that they take up a few minutes of a film that runs over two and a half hours that's a minor concern at worst.  Besides, Snyder's gritty, grimy portrayal of New York City and the unflinching portrayals of brutality are more than enough to outweigh a little excessive stylization.  The use of music is great as well, with the intro set to Dylan's "The Times They Are A-changing" and the sex scene set to Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah" being especially memorable.<br /><br />For a movie accompanied by so much hype (and a clearly large budget), the cast is pretty short on big names, but the relative lack of star power turns out to be something of an advantage, with the sprawling ensemble fitting almost perfectly into their roles and the film's alternate reality without overpowering it.  The juiciest parts go to Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the smirking, misogynistic nihilist Edward "The Comedian" Blake and Jackie Earle Haley as the tormented vigilante Walter "Rorschach" Kovacs, and neither disappoints.  The Comedian is an especially ambiguous figure for this genre: he appears on the surface to be (and in many ways is) a bloodthirsty villain, but a closer examination reveals someone who sees past the veneer of civilization to grasp mankind's true (and ugly) nature, and can't think of any reaction beyond laughter.  As played by Morgan, The Comedian is an almost completely irredeemable character, but I still couldn't help finding him at least a little sympathetic.  In the equally pivotal role of Rorschach, Jackie Earle Haley is even more compelling, with the air of menace in his voice (and, later, his face) more than making up for his character's laconic nature.  Much as in the book, Rorschach is as much a force of nature as a character, equally as capable of monstrous violence as of heroism, and Haley's alternately muted and fearsome performance captures all of the inner turmoil and bizarre compulsions that drive him forward.  Malin Akerman seems to have been singled out for criticism in her role as the second Silk Spectre, which I don't find entirely fair--her work in some of the more dramatic scenes in the later going didn't make me forget Merryl Streep, but her character clearly wasn't intended to be the most heavyweight of the bunch, and she's at least adequate most of the time.  Besides, her near-total hotness and prominent presence in the aforementioned sex scene should more than mitigate any concerns about her acting chops.  The rest of the major players--Billy Crudup as the tenuously human genetic mutation Dr. Manhattan; Carla Gugino as the aging, jaded original Silk Spectre; Matthew Goode as the superhuman crime-fighter-turned-tycoon Ozymandias; Patrick Wilson as the nostalgic, relatively normal and well-adjusted Nite Owl--are all pretty competent, even if a few of them seem to have been picked at least in large part for their resemblance to the characters from the book.  And of course, Robert Wisden deserves special mention for his frighteningly believable performance as the neurotic, high-strung President Nixon.<br /><br />Overall, in spite of a few minor flaws, Watchmen still easily manages to emerge as one of the top Hollywood movies released this decade.  While there were certainly a few concerns going in--its prodigious length, its daunting source material, the spotty record of recent superhero films--I for one was glued to the screen from minute one.  Having seen the movie, Moore's refusal to have his name associated with the project now seems more like pettiness than principle.  This is one adaptation he should be proud of.</p></br><a href="../users/A26O0T192IBKY1.html">A26O0T192IBKY1</a><br/><p>When this movie originally was released in theatres, I decided to wait until the actual director's cut came out. Mainly because I wanted to get the fully idealized version of the film, and because I wanted to avoid all the Watchmen review civil wars that were going on at the time.<br /><br />Anyway so as for the movie itself, this is based on Alan Moore's groundbreaking comic book maxi-series from the 80s(everyone forgets it was a comic 1ST and a graphic novel 2ND!). Moore wanted nothing to do with it, because he's had a bear up his butt ever since the last couple of movie fiascos based on his works(Constantine, From Hell, League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen). But Zack Snyder came along and made this sucker work. For the longest time, the project was plagued with doubt because no one really had any faith that it could be made into a coherent story. The mature nature of The Dark Knight helped cement the idea that not all superhero movies need to be corny action flicks<br /><br />The story is set in an alternate history during 1985. Nixon is STILL President, and Congress has put a ban on superheroes. The Comedian, a former hero from a group called Watchmen, is mysteriosly murdered. Rorschach, the only active hero, sets out to find his killer. What follows is a look into the background of all these now-retired heroes. Nite-Owl is dreaming of his glory days, Silk Spectre tries to live a life away from her mother while comforting Dr. Manhattan(the only one with powers), and Ozymandias is creating a new type of energy source with his vast fortune. However, Rorschach gets framed for killing an ex-villain. Nite-Owl hooks up with Silk Spectre, and frees Rorschach, while Dr. Manhattan is cooling off on Mars because he is blamed for giving his former friends cancer. It turns out the entire thing was a plot by Ozymandias set to stop the nations of the world from going into nuclear war. A final confrontation between the remaning heroes results in them going along with Ozymandias' idea, despite all the deaths it caused, except for Rorscach who ends up as snow pizza.<br /><br />Despite all the fanboy gripe that this movie got, there was an equal amount of praise for it. Most people's expectations got a little to high though, thinking that a Rated-R superhero movie would stay in the #1 spot for very long, which is unfortunate because that's how ALOT of jerks are going to insist on looking at it years from now. I thought the film as a whole captured all the important aspects of the original story, at least alot better than some other comic-based movies.

It is set in an alternate reality in 1985, where Nixon has been reelected for a 3rd term, the U.S. and U.S.S.R. are on the brink of nuclear war, and masked vigilantes are outlawed. The movie opens with the murder of one of those vigilantes and what appears as a plot to kill old superheroes turns out to be so much more. This movie is a great mystery, action, thriller disguised as a comic book movie. The story challenges you to think about society, liberalism, violence and morality as you ponder the possibilities of "what if superheroes existed?" If so, what would they be like and how would they act with all that power. The R rating is well deserved and young kids shouldn't be watching this. A great movie that makes you say "who watches the watchers?"<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Amazing picture and ear popping sound. All the spec features are ported over with some BD exclusives. FINAL VERDICT: DEFINITELY UPGRADE! A MUST OWN!</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>Not being familiar with the original graphic novel as I was with The Dark Knight I didn't have any expectations for this movie, but it far surpassed any I might have had. This is just a tremendously entertaining, hard-hitting, and dynamic movie, and at about 2 hours and 40 minutes, of truly epic proportions.<br /><br />It's also very gritty, violent, and with a number of adult scenes, so it might not be appropriate for the whole family.<br /><br />I'm sure the fans will have their bones to pick, but I couldn't find any serious shortcomings in the entire movie. Everything is just solid--the story, the script, the acting, and special effects. Not being able to speak with any authority about faithfulness to the original, I'll stick to a few comments about the movie itself.<br /><br />The series of lead-in scenes with the alternative history of a number of famous and iconic events is possibly the greatest movie lead-in I've seen. It's a brilliant start to a brilliant movie. And they go on for seemingly ten or fifteen minutes. And whoever the cinematographer was, he's truly an artist with the camera, creating many stunning shots and sequences. So the movie has tremendous visual appeal in addition to its other many strengths and attractions.<br /><br />All the actors were great in their roles, and not knowing the original characters I can't fault anything there. But overall the quality of the acting seemed excellent.<br /><br />As far as the quality of the video transfer goes, again I'm no expert, but I can say that on my 48-inch Samsung HD TV the quality seemed just fine. This DVD isn't a high-def transfer but it looked quite good on my TV, but it has internal upscaling and also I have an audio-visual processor, which, while not super-high end, is supposed to be decent, so that might account for video quality.<br /><br />The movie builds up to a dramatic climax, which is certainly a bittersweet one, but so as not to mention any spoilers I'll leave it at that. Overall, I think this is the best super hero movie of all time and one of the best movies of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A26O0T192IBKY1.html">A26O0T192IBKY1</a><br/><p>When this movie originally was released in theatres, I decided to wait until the actual director's cut came out.

Each one of the movies arrived with slight-to-moderate damage to the Blu-ray case (amaray).<br /><br />The present version of the Blu-ray case is relatively flimsy compared to the standard DVD case.  I hope someone comes up with another, sturdier version.  Of course if you buy a Blu-ray at the store and take it home it probably won't suffer the same damage mine did.<br /><br />Amazon -- are you paying attention?<br /><br />I opened the BD case hoping to find a booklet that would list all the bonus content.  Nope.  There ain't one.  But there IS, however, an insert telling us that a 5-disc ultimate collector's edition of the movie is due out in December 2009.  The insert includes directions on how to get a $10 discount on the Ultimate set, but you have to join the studio's rewards program.  There's always a catch, isn't there?  Join the rewards program and they will email you the discount coupon/code a few weeks before the DVD street date.<br /><br />Interesting that this release of "Watchmen" is an extended cut and that there doesn't appear to be an option to watch the theatrical cut.  What if you are one of the folks that likes the theatrical cut better than the extended cut?  Are you just out of luck?  Will you have to purchase the Ultimate Collector's edition to see the theatrical cut (if it is even included)?<br /><br />We had the same problem with "Amadeus".  A Director's Cut was released on DVD and, later, Blu-ray that didn't include the option to see the original theatrical cut instead.  Personally I prefer the theatrical cut of that film.  Seems unfair that we grow to love a certain version of a film and then are asked to buy a DIFFERENT version of it if we want to have a copy to own.<br /><br />"Watchmen" is the same way.  It would have been nice to walk out of the theater knowing we could buy the movie we JUST SAW when it comes out on DVD, perhaps with the option of seeing additional footage too.  But no -- can't do that.<br /><br />It's like a meal at a restaurant where the dish is prepared one way for dine-in customers and a different way for take-out orders.  What if you want take-out but like the dine-in version better?  Sorry.  Too bad.<br /><br />The other issue is the sound mix.  If you play it at a level where you can comfortably hear the dialogue, the sound effects are deafening. Don't hand me the "if it's too loud, you're too old" argument, either.  That's for concerts, not home video.  It is especially noticeable in the opening scene.  I live in an apartment with reasonably thick walls, but I still have to play this BD at lower-than-normal volume and turn on the English subtitle track.  I want to enjoy it but I'm not going to force my neighbors to suffer through it.  There is such a thing as common courtesy (though it is in increasingly short supply).</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>Seeing this in the theater on opening day was probably one of the greatest movie experiences in a lifetime. It's unfortunate that this movie had a 75% drop in its theatrical run after a successful opening, but not every movie is #1 5 weeks in a row, right?<br /><br />Watchmen is based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. It's a very well done adaptation. I've read the graphic novel twice, so I was excited to see this movie.<br /><br />And what an awesome movie it was!<br /><br />I was a bit skeptical about the almost 3-hour length (I don't have A.D.D), but in the end I was completely satisfied. I saw it with 3 people who hadn't read the graphic novel, and they even loved it too. I was very shocked though that there were kids at this movie, as if the rating 18A for "Gory Scenes, Brutal Violence" wasn't enough of a warning?<br /><br />The year is 1985. Nuclear War is a high threat. The doomsday clock has been set to 5 minutes to midnight. And an ex-superhero has been murdered. The Comedian (played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan), has been thrown out a window to his death. Upon this happening, the minutemen, now called the Watchmen, a washed-up ex-ensemble of superheroes has reunited to to one thing- save the world from nuclear threat.<br /><br />Watchmen is a brilliant movie. At 2 hours and 43 minutes it doesn't overstay its welcome. In fact I actually didn't want it to end. The entire cast was brilliant. The movie isn't as humorless as everyone says it is, there's lots of dry humor where appropriate, there is lots of action, and another thing is that it fits the "problems of society" feel that the comic created. Also the omissions were not as bad as people are exaggerating it to be- I must admit I liked the changed ending a lot better than the book ending. It's more realistic, and I must admit the book ending made me go "WTF".<br /><br />I shall warn you though, this movie is very violent and gory. I am a gorehound, and I found myself cringing and going "Ewwwwww" at a few bits. Do not see this if you are squeamish, because it IS very brutal and gruesome stuff.<br /><br />So overall, I have not one single complaint about this film, because it's an amazing work of art. This is brutal and and gruesome stuff that if hard to watch, and I love it. Consider it Snyder's masterpiece! I can't wait to get it on Blu-Ray when it comes out!</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>I should preface my review by admitting I have never read Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0930289234">1987 graphic novel</a> upon which this movie is based, and from my understanding, quite faithfully, at least until the end. Without such context, much less the fan-boy enthusiasm, this 2009 comic-book extravaganza is hamstrung by the limitations of conventional filmmaking despite a marathon 155-minute running time. The story is quite dense and multi-layered at first exposure, and while the alternate universe presented has strong entertainment value, there is less of a case for the frequent use of gratuitous violence to punctuate the nihilism of the story. Director Zack Snyder is an inspired choice to lead the character-driven mayhem given the visual invention he brought to the Battle of Thermopylae in 2007's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QXDED6">300</a>. His sharp eye for detail is evident throughout this elaborate production, but the movie has problems with pacing and more critically, a palpable absence of soul that would have made it more directly comparable to Christopher Nolan's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GZ6QC4">The Dark Knight</a>.<br /><br />Set in an alternate-reality 1985 with Richard Nixon in his fifth term, the story has the Cold War moving into high gear with the Soviets willing to test our country's resolve with the potential of a nuclear strike. The opening credits effectively trace the semi-familiar history that brings the plot to this point with golden-era, costumed crime-fighters giving way to the next generation of superheroes in the 1970's. Snyder goes as far as recreating the Zapruder video of the Kennedy assassination with the smoking gun held by the morally bankrupt Comedian, one of the Watchmen who moved from WWII-era pop icon to reviled vigilante three decades later. Looking like the dark side of DC Comics' Justice League of America, the Watchmen had long disbanded by the time the Comedian is murdered in his apartment. This sparks at least some of the confederation to reunite albeit with trepidation. They turn out to be a motley group of psychological misfits beginning with Laurie Jupiter, a.k.a. Silk Spectre II, hesitant about wearing her latex suit again to fight for justice like her now-alcoholic mother, and Nite Owl, a fallen man reduced to impotence by retirement.<br /><br />More interesting are Dr. Manhattan, blue-skinned and nude with the power of a god thanks to a Hulk-like paranormal lab accident; and Ozymandias, now known as Adrian Viedt, the world's smartest man and a billionaire captain of industry. However, the most intriguing Watchman is the appropriately named Rorschach, who wears a face mask with constantly shifting ink blots. A true loner in the tradition of Travis Bickle in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R8YC18">Taxi Driver</a>, he expresses a visceral loathing for mankind's dissoluteness that manifests itself into the film's goriest scenes. All the characters feel disconnected from humanity, and their warped perspectives drive the story. While Snyder pulls few punches in his depiction of them, the primary problem with the film is that he can't seem to pull it all together to make a dark-hearted adventure that can soar. Except for a clever use of Bob Dylan's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009MAP9A">The Times They Are A-Changin'</a> over the opening credits, Snyder's use of period music simply feels intrusive and out-of-sync without adding any texture to the film.<br /><br />Much of the comic-book-level dialogue also feels stilted, and unfortunately, few in the cast seem to know how to deliver it with conviction. The best of the bunch are Billy Crudup as the eerily becalming Dr. Manhattan and Jackie Earle Haley constantly seething with Eastwood-level rage as Rorschach. Jeffrey Dean Morgan registers with conviction in just a few scenes as the Comedian. However, their contributions are offset by the miscalculated performances of a too-bland Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl, Matthew Goode looking overly metrosexual as Ozymandia, and Malin Ackerman who plays Laurie in a petulant manner that trivializes her character's ambivalence about being a superhero. Granted there are good set-pieces like the bravura fight scene right at the beginning. Unfortunately, saddled with some surprisingly substandard CGI, the final scenes wring dramatically flat given the build-up to them, and they dampen my appetite for a sequel with the survivors. Even with all its flaws, the film boasts a visual audacity that is hard to pass up, especially if your appetite has been whetted by the novel. Clearly, Snyder has put greater priority in maintaining fidelity to the source material rather than making a movie that could resonate for the rest of us.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>Premise<br />*It is an alternate 1985.

The first hour or so of the movie is spent developing the characters and showing the world that they live in.  Some people may be dissapointed if they were expecting more action, especially for a movie that runs over two and a half hours long.<br />*Not for kids; rated R for quite a few scenes with gnarly bloody violence, some sex scenes, nudity (including full male nudity...with the blue guy nonetheless), brutality, and thematic elements.<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*The morality of this whole story is pretty messed up.  The "heroes" do a lot of wicked things, while the "villian" is righteous.  There is a deeper philosophical meaning to all this, and the story brings up some interesting ideas and questions.  But while much of it is thought-provoking and unique, some people may find it frustrating or just plain weird.<br /><br />In the movie, Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) described the miracle of life as a paradox, relating to "turning air into gold," and that might as well be the paradigm of this whole movie.  It is a paradox, not only because this film was said to be "unfilmable," but because here we have a comic-boook hero movie without any real heroes; instead, the characters are morally ambiguous and live in a world that is close to annihilation.  Yet, despite all of the condemning views of humanity, the movie ends with hope.  These are just some of the thoughts that this movie throws out at you; it is a very thought-provoking story with some insightful characters.  At the same time, the movie has some awe-inspiring imagery, a few good action scenes, and a surprising amount of blood, guts, cursing, and sex.  This is definitely not the usual comic-book adaptation, but whether you love it or hate it, it may just stick with you and leave you thinking.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>This movie offers plenty to like and a little to dislike. On the liking side, it does a great job of adapting Moore's complex story to the big screen. Of course, a few things had to be sacrificed, but what came though seems true to the 1980s original. As a comics movie, you might expect a major effects-fest, and the CGI crew delivers brilliantly. Most of all, Moore's original vision of switchback plot twists and moral ambiguity comes through as jarringly as it did when the original mini-series came out, back in the 1980s.<br /><br />That's also what some viewers will dislike. The movie addresses complex issues that we still face, including war, crime against women, and deciding whether ends justify means. Like the real world, this doesn't supply easy answers. The viewer isn't supposed to come away certain that justice has been served or that the good guys won. That's where I find another incongruity. The story addresses deep issues, but does so with shallow characters.<br /><br />There's a lot more to say about Watchmen's place in graphic novel history, but this isn't the place for that discussion. It's a good story, but it aged. This movie brings that story to life beautifully, but carries those signs of age with it. Go ahead, enjoy this one (at least, the parts you're supposed to enjoy), but don't expect it to change the universe of comic book movies.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI.html">A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI</a><br/><p>5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />Dark, twisted, deeply complex, undeniably the baser side of the human condition, or should I say the comic book hero condition, is Zack Snyder's, "Watchmen." Though the new Batman films have approached the subject matter in the duality of comic book heroes as imperfect people, living a lie as the perfect hero, no film touches this subject matter as the bottomless black vortex that is, "Watchmen." It's characters so disillusioned with their selves & the world, that it's hard to tell many of them apart from the bad guys their supposed to be protecting the world from. It is also a commentary of the Vietnam era, & contemplates President Nixon role as a leader if he was still in office in 1985. It does not look at individual criminals, but the human race as a whole, that is so corrupt, it is destined to implode on it's self from the weight of it's own decadence. There is violent murder, rape, lies, greed, vigilantism, hate, sex, loneliness, mass destruction, & worse of all, hypocrisy, in spades in this film. There are moments of pure transcendence, as "Watchmen" becomes more than just a comic book hero film, but a film that speaks of absolutes, if man kind is to survive as a species.<br /><br />This film is a joy to look at, some of the most potently spectacular scenes I've ever seen in a film of this type, mostly with "Dr. Manhattan. The scene where he is killing the Vietcong by the dozens, as a glowing, giant, god of destruction is just jaw dropping, both in the beauty & imagination of the scene, & the terror it brings with it. A true metaphor of what the Vietcong most of thought about America, charging into their country with weapons of destruction. The scenes on Mars, are truly awe inspiring, as Dr. Manhattan prefers the lifeless planet to a planet filled with humans bent on their own genocide, & the destruction of earth it's self. Other scenes too, of a smaller, but just as tragic scope. Rorschach being told by his mother she wishes he would not of been born after having sex with a john. Rorschach biting the ear off a bully, was pure unadulterated viciousness. The scene where he finds the little girl in the wood burner, & the dogs chewing, fighting, over her leg, & his vengeance not only on the dogs, but her killer is absolutely brutal. The Comedian, killing the pregnant Vietnamese woman, who was carrying his baby. He then looked at Dr. Manhattan who was shocked, & told him, he could've of stopped him anytime, but didn't. Dr. Manhattan's self startling realization that this was true. The Comedian hired by his own country to kill it's President. Yes, this is a film with a message, a deeply dark message, a true message, that super heroes mean nothing in a world that is ran by greed & corruption, by man. That only man can save mankind, & no other force, earthly or not, can change that. This is "Watchmen."</p></br><a href="../users/A3BJDFGSLXFB36.html">A3BJDFGSLXFB36</a><br/><p>I really wanted to see this film at the theater, but I just couldn't make it happen. I guess it was for the best because I was able to see the "director's cut" on DVD with additional scenes. I usually prefer director's cuts anyway.<br /><br />Anywho, I remember reading the Watchmen comic series when it was originally released back in the mid-80s. Back then, I knew I was reading something special, so I really looked forward to seeing the movie version.<br /><br />I must say, though, that this movie would have had a much bigger impact if it had been released before the 90s when the cold war was still in full swing. The threat of nuclear war just doesn't have the sting today as it did during those days.<br /><br />On the good side, I found the film to be very faithful to the graphic novel (I haven't read it in many years, but from what I can remember, the movie follows the comic very well; almost verbatim in some areas). The story is excellently crafted and makes you think. This is not your typical superheroes-save-the-world type of plot. It's dark, it's violent and the "heroes" have some serious flaws.<br /><br />The movie is visually stunning. It is simply a pleasure to look at. The effects, costumes, music, sets, etc. are all brilliantly done and come together to craft an excellent film.<br /><br />The casting was done well, but the standout performance here seems to be Jackie Earle Haley as the "anti-hero" Rorschach. His performance can be likened to Heath Ledger's Joker from last year's "The Dark Knight". Haley steals the movie with a truly tremendous performance. He personified the charcter so completely that whenever he is on screen, you can't help but notice his truly magnificent performance.<br /><br />All in all, Watchmen is a very enjoyable film and is worth repeated viewings. Many people complained about Dr. Manhattan's anatomy being too revealing, but if you think about his detachemnt from humanity, it is very fitting. It wasn't done in a gratuitous way and was not in the slightest bit sexual. Readers of the original graphic novel will remember that there were scenes of his "anatomy" in the comic as well. Come on, people. It's just a body part. All of us dudes have them. Let's grow up a little. There were also complaints about the film's graphic violence, but I've seen worse (try "Kill Bill" if you want excessive amounts of blood and gore).<br /><br />I recommend this film, but it definitely isn't for everyone. You might want to keep the kiddies away from this one. It's for mature audiences only.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This ultimate edtion to watchmen is a must have for all watchmen fans.<br />This is a great movie. love the characters and the story. this movie is so close to a comic i have ever seen. this movie rocks</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>There is a lot of Superhero action in this movie. The who-dun-it aspect is simple to figure out. What really bogs the movie down is the stiff acting by everyone and the ever constant heavy themes of blurring good and evil. I ask you, can the Watchmen really be good guys if they allow Nixon to become president 5 terms and disco music to survive?<br /><br />The movie does a poor job of introducing the characters. You are fed a pseudo history of the US with Watchmen during the opening credits. Once Bob Dylan is done playing, the movie starts and you are confused who the characters are. The relationship of the characters and their past deeds are relayed through flashback scenes, which in many cases were more interesting than the rest of the movie. The lack of character introduction wasn't as bad as "Final Fantasy VII" movie, but it is worse than what Tolkien did to us.<br /><br />The Superheros, a vigilante group who murder women and children for their country (an early good/evil blur) are semi-retired as wearing masks became outlawed. Someone is killing off the Superheros and superhero Rorschach is the most determined to find out.<br /><br />Dr. Manhattan (big blue guy, clothes optional)can't see into his future and has assumed we have annihilated each other. Meanwhile, Nixon and Kissinger are in the war room, in a scene which reminds us of Dr. Strangelove. They are debating a first strike.<br /><br />If you like your superhero action mixed in with pseudo history, political statements, blurred good/evil themes/ atheist statements (The watch has no watch maker), and the slinky Silk Spectre being zipped out of her costume (some nudity) then this movie is for you.<br /><br />If you like good acting, a well written chronological story, good dialogue, and a need to know the characters, and film editors past the third grade- go elsewhere.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Watchmen is a film directed by aesthetically strong Zac Snyder (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q6GX5Y">300</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ABURA">Dawn of the Dead</a> remake).  This film is as loyal a transfer as can possibly be imagined of the twelve issue <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401219268">comic book</a> masterpiece written by Alan Moore.  The Watchmen was a story tailor-made for the comic book medium, it isn't and never was intended to be made into a film, so I can at least partially sympathize with Moore's frustration in seeing this happen.  To be honest, I'm an even bigger fan of Moore's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1563898586">League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a> series and I'm a bit surprised and perplexed to not hear he has the same animosity toward the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JM5B">film</a> version of his work there, especially when considering the tremendous difference in the quality of that movie compared to Snyder's work on the Watchmen.  The Watchmen is an evenly paced epic that is surely not for everyone.  It has its minor flaws but it is still an outstanding achievement.<br /><br />To briefly summarize, the film takes place at a time that would be Richard Nixon's fifth term in office.  It is literally a setting that considers what might happen if superheroes were actual and had a major impact on our reality.  For example, Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), a naked blue omnipotent character, changes the results of our country's war in Vietnam.  A lot changes, so that is just one example.  Other characters include; the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), an elder Watchmen that has serious ethical issues; Silk Spectre II (Malin Ackerman), the daughter of a previous hero; Night Owl II (Patrick Wilson), a more virtuous hero with gadgets reminiscent of Batman; Rorsharch (Jackie Earle Haley), a masked vigilante outlaw type; and Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), a seemingly effeminate yet nearly invincible capitalist.<br /><br />I actually waited for the performances to be a bit of a disappointment, but they were not nearly as bad I had heard and expected from seeing how other actors perform within a Snyder film.  In fact, Haley's role as Rorsharch was actually exceptional.  He had a tremendous presence and seemed to know the character more deeply than his cast-mates.  It most likely helped of course that his character is more intense and tragic than the others.  On the flip side, Ackerman was flat more often than not, but she looked great.  Crudup can't be blamed as his character is no longer human.  Morgan was also great as the Comedian but I'll confess that I was not aware that he wasn't Robert Downey Jr. until after I watched the movie.  My other minor complaints would be the make-up used to age some of the characters like Silk Spectre I (Carla Gugino) and Richard Nixon (Robert Wisden) and that Phobos and Deimos would not appear the way they do on the Martian landscape like they do here.  That last one is admittedly a really silly nitpicking.<br /><br />There are many positive things to say about the visual effects but that should be pretty obvious just from the commercials.  The story is a hugely creative one and even when watered down for the screen it still serves as the film's strongest point by far.  It is more than enough to provoke some deeper thinking than other films within this sub-genre, but the pace of the story almost made me hope for a mini-series on Showtime or HBO at first.  In the end I had no problem with the slower scenes, but I know that some viewers did and will.  Still, Snyder and company make the film work well enough to give it a strong recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/ADLVFFE4VBT8.html">ADLVFFE4VBT8</a><br/><p>Who's watching the Watchmen? I do :)<br /><br />Watching Watchmen - it was a different experience for someone like me who never heard of them until the movie, probably because I live on a 'third' thread of reality, different from Watchers' own and what most people view as 'ours'. But this is not not scope of my review. Hundreds have been posted, discussing meaning, content and artistic skills. I will focus on the Blu-ray release because it's difficult to find a Blu-specific reviews when the DVD and Blu editions reviews are bundled together even though they are distinct products.<br /><br />_________________________________________________________<br /><br />Common content:<br />==============<br /><br />This version of the movie is labeled 'Director's cut' It's 186 minutes in length which adds 24 minutes to the theatrical version.<br /><br />There are several extras that, in the Blu version come on 1080P resolution, 2-channel stereo. The common 'extras' include:<br /><br />- The Phenomenon: The Comic That Changed Comics - the Original Graphics Novel's Groundbreaking Impact. The actors, writers, DC Comics people discuss the Watchmen, their meaning and their impact in the world of comics. About 30 minutes.<br /><br />- Real Heroes, Real Vigilantes: a marginally interesting discussion of the meaning of vigilantism complete with advice from experts (don't do it) with some focus on New York's Guardian Angles featuring Curtis Sliwa and the case of Bernhard Goetz, the New Yorker who shot 4 attackers in the subway back in 1985.<br /><br />- Mechanics: Technologies of a Fantastic World. A professor comments on whether the Watchmen's gadgets and Dr. Manhattan were possible in our 'real' world. 16 minutes.<br /><br />- My Chemical Romance Desolation Row Music Video - a very energetic music video.<br /><br />The digital copy disc - which WILL expire in July 2010 - is common to both editions. They are meant to be run on a PC or a Mac (needs iTunes 7.7 or later). I don't believe they could run on an Xbox, PS3 or PSP.<br /><br />On release date, Amazon emailed me a link that would have allowed me to download the movie and watch it on my PC but I was out on vacation at the time and by the time I was back home the actual movie on disc was delivered. I don't know the current orders would get the same treatment.<br /><br />Blu-ray specific:<br />================<br /><br />Video: 1080P<br />Audio: DTS-HD Master Audio (English), Dolby Digital surround (French)<br /><br />Maximum Movie Mode with Zack Snyder<br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />This is where Warner Bros., not known for putting a lot of extra effort into their BD editions threw everything and the kitchen sink at us, trying to take full advantage of Blu's capabilities.<br /><br />The Maximum Movie Mode (3M or MMM?) is watching the movie with Zack and a bunch of other people involved in the making of the movie cut in inside a PIP window and discuss or explain various topics ranging from personal views and what the movie meant to them and should mean to us to 'how we made this' talk.<br /><br />When Zack is on, he appears in the foreground while the movie continues to run inside a window and additional windows displaying related material run in parallel behind Zack's back.<br /><br />But this is only the beginning. On and off, while the movie is running, little windows pop up to show us:<br /><br />- Stacks of storyboard sketches synchronized to the movie scene.<br />- Frames from the original Watchmen graphic novel showing how faithful the movie makers were to the original content.<br /><br />Several dozen 'Press enter now' prompts will stop the movie to allow for<br /><br />- Browsing through content-related galleries of 'stills' each stack with its own background music<br />- Viewing 3-4 minute long featurettes on various topics. The featurettes can be accessed individually from the Menu.<br /><br />Of course, the MMM can't replace actually watching the movie because, half of the time, the soundtrack volume is lowered to allow for Zack or his associates to express their views and the picture is overlayed with the various visual inserts. Given the movie's length and the several dozen optional featurettes and galleries of stills, the 3+ hours could turn into double that. Having watched the movie once, I found it helpful to run the MMM at 1.5 speed. This cut the viewing time to a reasonable length and made watching the MMM worthwhile.<br /><br />BD Live<br />-------<br /><br />The ability to connect to the Net from the menu is a nice technological capability but it doesn't look like anyone was able to make good use of it yet. I did access the feature but I did not find the Net excursion to be time well spent.<br /><br />First of all, Warner wanted me to register: user ID, email address, 'strong' password. It's a process that's initiated from the movie menu and continues on one's PC after a confirmation email from Warner is received. Each studio would want their own registration/password/email, it seems. Pretty awkward.<br /><br />Once in, a Watchmen trailer began to run on a small 'screen inside the screen' - I've watched the movie already, thank you very much and having to wait for this feature to actually load was annoying.<br /><br />Warner's BD Live house for Watchmen allows for posting personal video comments on the movie. 4 were posted of which 3 had the word 'test' in their title. One of the 2 I watched had someone looking and sounding embarrassed for what he was doing. The other one was in German.<br /><br />In addition, it's possible to link 'something' to Facebook but I didn't find it worth pursuing.<br /><br />There is also a Warner Bros. 'store'.<br /><br />Blu-ray evaluation<br />------------------<br /><br />I understand that some don't see much of a difference between BD's 1080P resolution and DVDs or upconverted DVDs but I do. All my new movies are Blu-ray now because I prefer the better picture resoulution and soundtrack quality. This alone, make the Blu-ray product - enhanced image and sound - different to me.<br /><br />I found the Maximum Movie Mode a great addition to the package. The content was informative and the presentation was innovative. I was amazed that the main 'movie' disc had sufficient room to host a 3+ hour movie plus what appeared to be at least one extra hour of hi-res full screen video and all the little windows content.<br /><br />The BD Live I can live without it (see above) but, to be fair, no one that I know came up with a really interesting BD Live extension to a movie. It's unlikely that I will access it again.<br /><br />Overall, I will grant this WB's Blu-ray release 4.5 stars rounding up to 5 for quality, effort and innovation.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TOH8S8I1VT9R.html">A1TOH8S8I1VT9R</a><br/><p>And that, in a nutshell, is what is great and not so great about "Watchmen".  I must apologize for being esoteric, but if I explain it I would be guilty of spoilers.  It should suffice to say that said "Archie" scene was both a defining moment of this films wonderful human elements and gratuitous to the point of being tedious.  That said, one scene, or 6 or 7 for that matter, were not enough to spoil my enjoyment of a film by a guy who has made one of my least favorite films (300).  If you haven't realized by now, this is never an easy film, yet I was surprisingly up to the challenge.  Before I really start to ramble on, I'd better chop this up a little.<br /><br />REDEMPTION FOR ZACK SNYDER?<br />It sure sounds like I'm picking a fight (who, ME?) but I have my reasons.  For better or worse, Zack has made a name for himself by bringing comic books to life on screen (excuse me, "Graphic Novels" puh-lease!).  His first big hit "Sin City" was pretty successful and highly regarded.  I'll be damned if I'll ever get to see it.  It's been on my list for years.  Yet, I'll take the word of those who liked it.  Next was "300".  What can I say that my "300" review didn't; it was a silly cartoon based on one of the greatest last stands in human history.  Though faithful to the equally goofy comic... ...excuse me; GRAPHIC NOVEL (yeesh!) I thought it was highly overrated and translated poorly to the cinema.  So, knowing he directed "Watchmen" was not working as an endorsement for me.  In fact, I had great trepidation that this would be another nutty "300" with cartoon violence and gratuitous sex.  I was right.<br /><br />I'M NOT A FAN OF NOIR COMIC BOOKS (or "Graphic Novels")<br />I almost bought this book.  But as I leafed through it at the book store, I decided I would pass on its meager 1940's style graphics and tiny word bubbles.  This was all done for a great purpose that the comic geeks could tell you about, but it wasn't pulling me in.  I'm not a big fan of the trend towards dark comics with dystopian alternate realities either.  I don't mind troubled characters but I want them to succeed on some level and at least live in a normal, screwed up world.  A world on the brink of self destruction is a bit too heavy for me. Besides, I don't like clouding my judgment of a film by reading the book first.  I work in reverse order.  This book has all the things I don't want in a comic and the film followed suit.<br /><br />GRATUITOUS IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH A WORD<br />There was a point in this movie when I leaned over to my friend (yes, I have a couple) and whispered; "is this what they mean by "blue movie"?".  My friend chuckled.  You see, the god-like Dr. Manhattan, who always glows in a blue light, was getting it on with the "Silk Specter".  So, they were having sex in blue light.  Ok, it's not so funny when you read it, but I thought it was a good one.  Anyway, like 300, sex scenes seem to be sprinkled in just for kicks.  Now I'm not against sex in general, but as the saying goes; been there, done that.  Though sex actually does enhance some moments of the film (the "Archie" scene I alluded to earlier) it really does nothing to move the plot along.  In fact the "Archie" scene was more of a comedic moment than the steamy hot moment it was depicted to be.  I guess super heroes with ED require different cures.  It's funny what can float your boat (you'll just have to see it).  Regardless, this might have been the only time in the film where I got a little bored (crazy, I know).  This doesn't sound so bad until you see Dr. Manhattan getting all up in your face with his schlong for extended periods.  I'm not particularly prudish about full frontal nudity when handled properly, but this was a bit much.  This blue god-man was every man's worst locker room nightmare; the naked guy who acts like he's dressed.  You know the one.  He walks around without a towel and insists on carrying on conversations with his wanker hanging in your face.  You can tolerate this for a minute or two, but he insists on walking around like this for 20 minutes or so.  That's how Dr. Manhattan comes across in this movie.  I don't want to get into his god-like mindset (what god needs cloths?), I just don't need to see him, or a woman for that matter, standing there naked ALL THE TIME!  I'm a big believer in sexual teasing in films.  There's nothing more arousing than that.<br /> I haven't even touched on the violence in this film.  Unlike "300" with its CG blood spraying everywhere, "Watchmen" holds back a little more.  Yet there is no shortage of dismemberment, face-smashing, bone-popping brutality.  Though the action is limited, I thought it was well staged and not nearly as posed as in "300".  I kind of enjoyed that part of it.  So, in review; Sex and nudity is too much.  Bone crushing brutal violence is OK.  As twisted as that sounds it was all gratuitous to the nth degree.<br /><br />IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CHARACTERS<br />I wouldn't say "Watchmen" has a particularly great or original story.  What makes it original are its characters.  You've got a guy who's a lot like Batman on the surface, yet nothing like Batman in demeanor.  You've got a hero who is only a hero based on which side he's on.  Some call these types "anti-heroes".  I call them A-holes.  You've got slutty vulnerable women heroes who kick butt; very cool.  You've got a guy who is nothing like Batman on the surface, but has an even deeper, demented lack of compromise when it comes to justice.  You've got the genius hero trying to save humanity with big swings and you've got the Goddish Dr. Manhattan who muddies the waters with his fading touch with humanity.  What you end up with is a bunch of gifted people with all their warts and flaws trying, for the most part, to do the right things even if it kills us.  As far as superheroes go, they mostly appear to be highly skilled fighters with mysterious enhanced strength or agility.  Even though you never truly understand how most of the characters came by there special abilities, it never really is that important to know with the exception of Dr. Manhattan.  The biggest bummer of them all is that my favorite character bites the big one in the end.  The great thing is I cared.<br /><br />WHO'S WATCHING THE WATCHMEN?  I AM!!<br />It's no big surprise then that I loved this movie.  Despite never having read the book, despite my disdain for the genre and Zack Snyder, despite what I felt was overwrought sexuality (crazy, I know) and despite a story that wasn't great, I loved this movie.  I was entertained for almost the entire 3+ hours.  For this I can thank the perfectly cast actors (check IMDB for details) portraying incredible characters that drip with humanity (Dr. Manhattan not withstanding).  The story serves well enough as a scaffold for these character to interact and react in.  I also have to give proper respect to Zack Snyder for actually not overdoing MOST of this film.  In fact, most of it was just plain stunning to look at.  I don't care if the book's author was cheesed off about this production.  I don't care if it was true to source material or not (as I haven't read it).  As a Superhero movie "Watchmen" just bumped down a bunch of other Super-movies on my list, including "Dark Knight".  Highly recommended for those seeking great, original characters presented in an entertaining way.<br /><br />Action......4 stars<br />Acting/Characters......6 Stars<br />Visuals......4.5 stars<br />Gratuities....3.5  stars<br />Average......4.5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A2UUP58XPQW3GF.html">A2UUP58XPQW3GF</a><br/><p>Comic book adaptations are all the rage these days and they are a dime-a-dozen. To prepare for this review, I re-read the graphic novel so I can give a more detailed viewpoint. "Watchmen" is adapted from the award-winning 12-issue mini-series in the 80's which in turn became a popular graphic novel. The graphic novel was written by Alan Moore (From Hell, V for Vendetta) and illustrated by Dave Gibbons (Green Lantern) and adapted to the big screen by Zack Snyder (300). This is Snyder's third full-length feature film, and he is in familiar ground in taking well-received formulas in pop culture, make it a strong visual affair and he calls the film a "tribute" or a homage. Most of the time, Alan Moore is displeased with the final result when his story is adapted; as far as I can recall, only twice has he requested his name removed from a film's credits because of his strong displeasure--it was with the Wachowski's "V for Vendetta" and you guessed it...in "Watchmen". This is why you only see "based on the graphic novel illustrated by Dave Gibbons" in the credits. Moore's name appears in the credits of "League of the Extraordinary Gentlemen" and "From Hell". (whether it was because of the insistence of the producers or he gave his blessing for these other films, I do not know)<br /><br />The government has banned "super-hero" operations with a law passed in the senate and most heroes have retired. When a former super-hero called "The Comedian" (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is murdered, a still operating vigilante called Rorshach/Walter Kovacs (Jackie Earle Harley) takes it upon himself to investigate and comes to the conclusion that someone is killing "masked" vigilantes. He takes it upon himself to warn his fellow super heroes such as the Nite Owl/Dan Drieberg (Stephen McHattie), Silk Spectre/Laurie Juspeczyk (Malin Akerman), Dr. Manhattan/Jon Osterman (Billy Crudup) and a genius industrialist Ozymandias/Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode) of the supposed conspiracy. Aided by his former partner, the Nite Owl and Silk Spectre 2, what they find is just something so unbelievably insane that it will shake the very world.<br /><br />I wasn't kidding when I said that Snyder makes these "tribute" films. "Watchmen" is so full of iconic sequences that is lifted from the graphic novel; the scene in the prison mess hall, Dr.Manhattan`s citadel, all would give fans a reason to rejoice. The dialogue is almost derived word for word, Snyder succeeds where he has excelled in "300", the viewer does feel like he is reading a live action comic book. The characters in the film have plenty of development in the form of flashbacks, fans of the graphic novel will be thrilled. The film is pretty much lifted from the novel with some minor additions--the film is more action-packed than the graphic novel (brutal, fast and hard-hitting), some sequences are extended and some are deleted. The film has its share of sex scenes and nudity and you see Dr. Manhattan the way he was in the comic--stark naked most of the time. The film does emulate a certain darkly foreboding mood, but it also doesn't lose it's sense of black humor. The screenplay by David Hayter and Alex Tse is meant to give us a sense of nostalgia, and they do succeed, well, at least until the final act of the film...<br /><br />Purists of Alan Moore's storyline will be a little disappointed as certain key elements in the graphic novel are missing. Laurie is a smoker (which is why she turned on the flamethrower and caused the accident) and abhors donning her costume, the original Nite Owl wasn't killed by gang members in the film, the boy in the news stand does make an appearance but the key subplot on what he was reading is missing. That subplot, "Tales of the Black Freighter" was extremely important in the graphic novel's commentary on humanity's sense of survival. The conversation in Mars between Laurie and Dr. Manhattan is significantly short, and loses a lot of its dramatic and emotional edge. Yes, Snyder and company does make an impressive visual and aural feast, but they missed the original story's dark message and philosophical relevance.<br /><br />I am also assuming that Alan Moore had his name removed because the climax takes a significant nose dive and I am sure purists will be very upset. The climax in the film lacked a strong effect on its narrative as it deviated from the original material. This ending may be easier to connect with for those unfamiliar with the graphic novel, but honestly, it felt very clich&eacute;d, unimaginative and predictable. The approach in the graphic novel was very methodical, moody and full of emotions which is why it became a so-called holy ground for comic fans. This film is just another Hollywood fare that uses the source material as a template and not as its stimulation and inspiration.<br /><br />The direction by Zack Snyder is competent but it does have a lot of problems. Sure, it is difficult to compress 12 issues into one film--but one can stay faithful to the feel, essence and thought of the original. He uses the recognizable scenes and famous illustrations as camera shots to tickle fans of the graphic novel. The film has an overabundance in slow motion, and while I thought this was meant to emulate the feel a comic reading experience, Snyder could have done well in refraining a bit from the slo-mo. The direction does present quite a number of plot holes, and felt uneven at times. The biggest goof of them all occurs in the final act of the film when Dan Drieberg said that "everything will be ok, as long as people believe Jon is watching over them (or was it "watching them?).." which is PURE contradiction to what happened before and to the book's essence. I cannot disclose any more without further spoiling the film, you will have to see for yourself but how can fear be the one factor to inspire peace? Wasn't the "Watchmen" supposed to help people live without fear? The direction is definitely a mere "copy" of the sequences from the novel, and Snyder made no effort to make the "Watchmen" mythos his own and insists that audiences should fill in the plot gaps themselves.<br /><br />The performances are decently acted for the most part and I thought Jackie Earle Harley stole the show as Rorshach. I loved the scenes when he was in prison. The character is by far the most interesting character of them all. Walter Kovacs would give the most ruthless movie serial killers pause. Malin Akerman is charming as Silk Spectre 2 and luscious Carla Gugino even makes an appearance as her mother. I found Stephen McHattie's "Nite Owl" quite amusing but found Matthew Goode's "Ozymandias", interesting but a little underwhelming--his plan made him unworthy of being the "smartest guy in the world". The CGI rendered "Dr, Manhattan" looks very good and maintains a creepy nature to his character.<br /><br />The visuals are very well done and the CGI rendered environment is quite cool to look at. The costumes have been improved to give the film a more "real" feel, Dr. Manhattan and Rorshach are the only two characters who had their appearances unaltered from the comic. The special effects does give the illustrations in the novel a certain amount of homage. The soundtrack is reminiscent from the 60's, 70's and 80's music which I thought was a good approach to give the scope of its diverse periods, but some may say that this approach hampered the film as it lost a lot of the brooding, moody feel of the source material. There is a good number of sex and nudity, as well as a strong display of violence against women.<br /><br />Now, do not let my observations as to how it deviated from its source material give the impression that I didn't like the film. Complaints aside, "Watchmen" is entertaining enough and it is worth a look. The film is polished with high production values and is a visual marvel that I still have to commend the effort. Those unfamiliar with the graphic novel will no doubt be impressed but hardcore fans of the original story will be a little disappointed. It also does have the potential to turn off some viewers since it does somewhat glorify some harsh realities of human nature (the graphic novel never did that, instead condemns it). It is just a purely ineffective vision of the "Watchmen" mythos; while its main premise was faithful to the source material, it never achieved any complexities in emotional and psychological impact. While not an excruciating film, Snyder's adaptation missed the mark that it felt absolutely unnecessary. After more than 2 hours watching Snyder's rendition, to expose certain heartbreaks, satirical touches, nicely shot action sequences, it gave very little in the way of artistry, emotions and thrills that I found myself pining for the source material's philosophical significance. I can understand Alan Moore's request that his name not to be associated with Snyder's vision.<br /><br />Recommended!

Every baby boomer's nightmare.  However, the old rock, Pete Seeger and Paul Simon songs lulled me into a "oh boy" factor -- and in a lot of ways it was "oh boy."<br /><br />The fight scenes were nicely choreographed.  Silk Spectre II and the Night Owl made a great team.<br /><br />Did I care for the Comedian or that he was murdered early in the film?  Nope.  A very anti-hero's hero.  Whatever heroism he had in the Forties was lost on me.  Beating up and raping, shooting a pregnant woman, -- in fact, women were handled fairly badly throughout the film purely for shock value.  What was Alan Moore thinking?<br /><br />There's a difference between breaking the mold in comic book or filming and then there's just plain porn.  Porn in the sense of  blood and guts and gore and Moore's almost misogynous writing as well as  the broken bones cutting through flesh, chopping off limbs with a saw, and buckets of blood -- a lot of the violence a bit too much.<br /><br />A film not for the squeamish.<br /><br />Zack Snyder's 300 was quite the tour de force -- the ancients were as bad and as bloody as they came complete with "madness."<br /><br />Watchmen was uneven.  I was thrilled ,repulsed and excited and depressed all at once.<br /><br />Almost like an X-rated "the Incredibles"; heroes being banned (becoming and old hat plot) and then coming back -- except in The Incredibles the heroes won.  In Watchmen, the "heroes" put a lot of people away in the name of "peace."<br /><br />Ozymandias' doubtful morals and Rorschach's intense right-wing ethics makes the film watchable.<br /><br />Recommended, but not for the squeamish.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0930289234">Watchmen</a></p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Warning: for those that haven't seen the film or read the graphic novel, spoilers are ahead.<br /><br />Ever since Zack Snyder announced that he was bringing Watchmen to the big screen, I had a great amount of reservations.  Not about the man himself, whose 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead I enjoyed, and whose adaptation of Frank Miller's 300 I thought was stunning, but because of the fact that this is Watchmen for crying out loud.  The most celebrated comic ever crafted was deemed unfilmable for so long, but finally here we are, and what is the verdict on Snyder's take of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' classic?  Mostly positive, but not without its flaws either.  From a visual standpoint, Snyder has nailed the environment of Watchmen, as well as the appearances of the characters that populate the film.  The biggest flaw of the film however lies in its conclusion.  Even though the end result of the comic remains unchanged, changing the cause to being blamed on Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) just doesn't sit right with me.  Maybe it's the fanboy in me, but with the appearance of Ozymandias' (Matthew Goode) genetically altered pet Bubastis, and with no mention of his work on genetics (which plays into his construction and development of the squid-like creature in the comic), doesn't this raise a few moments of confusion, especially for those who never read the comic?  Despite this, the rest of Watchmen has been translated greatly.  While there are some other questionable slight changes as the story develops, the film retains the paranoid and compelling tone of Moore's comic.  Not to mention the perfect casting of Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach, Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, Crudup as Dr. Manhattan, and Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl; all of whom are superb.  Also, for a 160-some minute running time, it doesn't feel like it's that long, as you can't help but be glued to the screen from the brilliant title sequence onward.  All in all, Zack Snyder's take on Watchmen isn't without its flaws, but it is a visually stunning comic adaptation that manages to defy nearly everything that was going against it.  It isn't perfect, but it still manages to be something special as well, which is quite an achievement in itself.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VJ7HYM1EC94M.html">A1VJ7HYM1EC94M</a><br/><p>Set in a semi-fictional America - with all the familiar players - Zack Snyder's "Watchmen" is one of the most impressive movies I've seen so far this year. Snyder, cast and crew were dedicated to re-creating as truthfully as possible, the comic book elements fans of the series that its fans would demand. It paid off, but not without a few lulls. To his credit (and the horror of many) Snyder does not skimp one iota on the graphic violence, heightened sexuality and though deadly serious, liberally peppered with humor. The film opens with a brief scene of violence to set the time and planet jumping tale, followed by the most impressive opening credit sequence I've ever seen. In fact, the opening credits themselves - a recreation of many of the most iconic moments in 60's and 70's American history - are worth the ticket price. I found myself stirred emotionally, opening myself up for the insane, frightening world I was about to enter.<br /><br />Most of the performance in Watchmen are adequate (Malin Akerman's Silk Spectre II) to top drawer (Billy Crudup's impressive Dr. Manhattan), with one particularly thrilling, pulse-pounding performance by Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach, arguably the heart and soul of the film. Haley's performance is so richly nuanced, starting at near fever pitch and growing in intensity from there. He is participant, narrator, catalyst for much of what happens through the film and clearly up to the challenge of a role that could easily have become . . . well, too cartoonish. He is, in a word: amazing.<br /><br />Patrick Wilson is wonderful as the geekish, peaceable Dan/Night Owl, an endearing, soft-grained performance that tempers the often out-of-control violence in the world of Watchmen.<br /><br />To Billy Crudup fell the unenviable task of making the elusive, cool-as-a-cucumber Dr. Manhattan a more likeable screen presence than he is required to be in the print-only version of the tale. He succeeds nicely, even stuck in the connundrum of wondering whether the human race is worth saving. It's a chilling proposition, particularly when we know/learn of Manhattan's previous human existence. The accident that created him is one of several moments in the film where Snyder expands the tension of the moment to let our emotions swell, this one (and the final scene) allowing for lump-in-the-throat heartbreak. Just as he is in the comics, Dr. Manhattan is naked through most of the film and eventually one gets used to the fact that almost every time we see him we're going to see his flacid blue penis. The CGI-transformed Crudup is brilliantly calm as he rationalizes his action (and non-action) to the point of frustration to all around him (especially Richard M. Nixon).<br /><br />There will be plenty of naysayers, and fans who feel short-shrifted there favorite moments were not included, but such is the nature of filmmaking. Watchmen stayed with me through the night, and has, so far, dominated my thoughts today and I want to see it again soon. Even with its sometimes slowed down pacing, there is much to miss in this veritable "feast for the eyes" and I'd like to catch every frame as much as possible. I'd go just for Jackie Earle Haley's amazing tour-de-foce performance of Rorschach.</p></br><a href="../users/A6DOCZ10B7JAJ.html">A6DOCZ10B7JAJ</a><br/><p>PURE BRILLIANCE!!  And dare I say it??  BETTER than the book!<br />Oh geez, I can already sense the comic book purists ready to crucify me.  Relax dudes, stop hyperventilating, wipe the fog from your glasses.  This is just my opinion, and I can say with no hesitation--this film is top-notch, quite possibly even better than the graphic novel!  I think they are both remarkable achievements, of course, but the movie does surpass the book in one major area.  More on that later.<br /><br />Okay, I'm aware of Mr. Moore taking his name off the credits.  That move really makes no sense to me.  Mainly because I am fairly certain he received a fat paycheck for the rights to this story.  If he felt so strongly against any deviation to his artistic vision, he should have stood adamant with his original writing.<br /><br />Now, I am usually the first to diss Hollywood.  I still loathe the changes they made to the great comic book series WANTED.  But some alterations can be good, remember the novel adaptation of THE SHINING?  Some people will criticize something just because it strays from the version they were expecting.<br /><br />And for those who say this movie doesn't capture the emotional capacity of the book--I say BULLOCKS!!!  This movie is packed with excellent depictions of fear, anger, confusion, regret, lust, sadness, apathy, humor, anxiety, sarcasm, pain....seriously, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more thorough psychological examination at the theater.  This is humanity exposed, inside and out.<br /><br />I imagine the harshest criticism for this film is due to the ending.  Zack Snyder does stay EXTREMELY close to the book until the climax.  I am totally surprised to say that I loved it!  It was a small alteration, but made a big difference.  The change was just plain brilliant, plus it made perfect sense with this story.  Really, think about it--would the director make such a drastic change to the end of the most celebrated graphic novel of all time if he wasn't positive of the results?  I think not.<br /><br />WATCHMEN is easily the best film so far this year.  Along with THE DARK KNIGHT and IRON MAN, it's amazing to see the genre rise above the label of popcorn entertainment.  This most likely won't appeal to the masses.  Kudos to the cast and crew for their stellar efforts.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>An ex-group of heroes find themselves back together after one of their own is killed. They teamed up in the 60's but now it's the 80's and super heroes are outlawed by President Nixon.<br /><br />  Now Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) is out to bring them back together. While Dr. Manhattan, the only one with actual powers isn't even sure whether he wants to give up on humans or not. His girlfriend Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) is his only link to humanity.<br /><br />  However since Dr. Manhattan's so obsessed with his work, he's pushing Spectre into the arms of Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson of Lakeview Terrace). But it's a bad time for Manhattan to give up on humans since bombs are about to drop and he's the only chance in stopping them.<br /><br />  The movie is often brutally violent and disturbing even. It's far darker than Sin City and the Dark Knight. So don't expect a totally fun super hero adventure. Just expect a complicated but entertaining movie. It has it's share of fun action but some might find that it doesn't have enough action. I still found it fascinating though with some great visuals.<br /><br />  I didn't really care that there was a lot of talk. I loved the characters and the performances. Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Supernatural season 1, Grey's Anatomy), gives a star making performance like many reviews have said. However, I think Patrick Wilson is also surprisingly excellent as a former hero who won't admit that he misses doing it. While he has excellent chemistry with Malin Akerman.<br /><br />  Jackie Earle Haley's performance is a little under-rated as well, some critics didn't like it anyway. Yes, he sounds a lot like Christian Bale's Batman when he talks. Yet, he still probably gives the most engaging performance in the movie next to Billy Crudup. He totally owned the character as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Director Zack Snyder deserves a lot of credit for sticking as close to the graphic novel as possible, yet changing just enough to not totally alienate someone who has never heard of or read the source material before taking the venture to the local theater.<br /><br />The visuals are a thing of beauty. The grimy city looks and feels like a living organism. The CGI world and other various visual effects throughout the entire movie are well done, never forcing you out of this alternate 1985. By the way, this flick holds nothing back in the blood and guts department either. Not quite Sin City level, but darn close.<br /><br />The cast is hit and miss. Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach is by far the best fit of any character in the film. He is just amazing with and without the ever changing inkblot mask. I read rumors that he might play Freddy Krueger in The Nightmare of Elm Street remake. I would have said "no way" before, but now I'm convinced that he would be the best replacement for Robert Englund (though I don't think the original needs to be remade). Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, who is best known to me as the father of the two Winchester boys on the TV show Supernatural, is also outstanding even though he has limited screen time. Billy Crudup's soft and monotone voice actually fit the powerful Dr. Manhattan nicely, seeming to add intelligence to every word. I know a lot of people think that Malin Akerman was miscast, but I quite enjoyed her and thought she brought the right amount of sexiness to Silk Spectre II.<br /><br />The Comedian's death, the inspired 7 minute or so title sequence and Dr. Manhattan's whole transformation story are the true hightlights, as well as, most of Rorschach's scenes.<br /><br />Now for the negatives. Patrick Wilson was just okay as the boring Nite Owl II, but I never cared much about the character to begin with. Matthew Goode as Ozymandias was the worst of the whole lot in my opinion. Not horrible by any means, but the weak link for sure. The soundtrack features some great classic rock songs, but other than Bob Dylan's "The Times They Are A'Changin" over the titles, none really mesh well with what's on screen.  Also, the first 2/3 of the movie are really good, but the last 1/3 does drag and even left me wanting to revisit earlier moments.<br /><br />Overall, as a casual fan of the graphic novel, I found more to admire than dislike with Watchmen the movie. Those uninitiated into this world may be checking their watch often, but most fans should be happy with what Snyder managed to do with this "unfilmable" material.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>Watchmen's only downfall may be that it is too complex and brilliant a story to appeal to a general public expecting a simple action-filled superhero movie.  More an intricate conspiracy thriller than a crime-fighting actioner, Watchmen plays out around an earth-shattering mystery, but the process of uncovering the truth retains the stimulating adventure, flashy visuals, and mesmerizing blend of sensationalism and morbid examination of human nature expected from a new generation of comic book movies.  Watchmen is a no-holds-barred exploration into infinite power and its subsequent corruption, draped in the visceral glory of the most imaginative visual minds.<br /><br />Watchmen is set in an alternate 1985 where masked superheroes once ruled the night, the United States won the Vietnam War, and Richard Nixon continues his Presidency as the "Doomsday" clock predicting total nuclear destruction remains set at 5 minutes to midnight. The twisted plot unfolds through the eyes of washed-up former superhero Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), a masked vigilante whose paranoid psychosis is surpassed only by his uncompromising quest for justice.  When The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a Watchman with sadistic methods of retribution is mysteriously murdered, Rorschach scours the underbelly of the city for clues to his comrade's untimely demise.  Uncovering a devastating conspiracy to kill all remaining superheroes, he must enlist the aid of several former colleagues, including Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) and Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman), to wage a suicidal war against a criminal mastermind of nearly limitless power.<br /><br />Presented in a film noir narration by Rorschach, Watchmen is nothing less than a superhero movie fused with action, drama, romance, science-fiction, fantasy, crime thriller, and murder mystery. To call it simply a comic book movie wouldn't do it justice; in fact, with its lack of actual paranormal powers, it's really not a superhero movie at all. It intricately blends politics, morals, and societal complexities into an unrelenting thinking-man's fantasy epic that intelligently challenges the ideas of vigilantism, nuclear war and the abuse of power. But will the superhero crowd, not entirely familiar with Watchmen lore, embrace a film so esoterically heavy and appropriately lengthy?<br /><br />With so many plots, red herrings and backstories to tell, Watchmen clocks in at nearly three hours long - and still can't cover everything. Most impressive is the amazing visuals and unique imagery brought to life from Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon's graphic novel, coupled with sex, action and violence never before seen in a comic book movie. There's no shortage of nudity or graphic bloodshed in Watchmen as the fate of the world rests on the shoulders of psychopaths, glorified gang members with a penchant for dressing up and finishing what the law can't, and a nuclear accident victim gone awry. To call Watchmen simply a comic book movie would be as helpful as "a photograph of oxygen to a drowning man."<br /><br />- The Massie Twins</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>This may be the most literal film adaptation of a print property we'll ever see, but that alone can't make it half as successful as it could have been. Having grown up with the trade paperback by my bedside, a holy grail of sorts for comic book fanatics, it's almost a religious experience to see these themes, characters and visuals represented so loyally on the big screen. As he did with 300, Zac Snyder has absolutely nailed the look and feel of the comics, breathtakingly, but underneath that dazzling surface is a terrible lack of soul, conviction and character. With the exception of Jackie Earl Haley, who is absolutely magnificent as the mentally teetering vigilante Rorschach, this is a large collection of miscast characters which never really seem to buy into what they're saying or doing. The words are right, ripped line-for-line from the bubbles and narrative boxes of the comics, and of course everyone looks great, but bland inflections, bad interpretations and a hectic, compressed timeframe strip away the power of the plot's weightiest moments. In a way it's TOO loyal, as it's surprisingly the one major moment that steps away from the guiding hands of the source material - a significant tweak to the story's conclusion - that works the best. Snyder was ambitious to tackle such a booby-trapped property, and to do so with such a passionate love for its roots is admirable, but there's a reason it was dubbed unfilmable for so many years. There's so much going on at any given moment that even the most familiar reader runs the risk of being bucked, and even at three hours, a large portion of the story is left on the cutting room floor. And for Watchmen, those seemingly-dispensible character moments are every bit as important as the heaviest plot developments. A valiant effort, but ultimately a failed one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Somewhere in New York City 1985 in an alternate dimension, President Nixon is still the president of the United States instead of Ronald Regan and superheroes have existed but have been outlawed since the late 70's.

After years of development hell through various studios, Warner Brothers wih DC films and Paramount have finally greenlighted the film thanks to the director Zack Snydner's successful "300" which in turn was based on a graphic novel. I'd say it was worth the effort Snyder has done to bring a classic masterpiece of comics to the big screen in a successful way in fact he's a fan of the graphic novel and used it as storyboards for the film. It's a complex mix of superhero film, fantasy, Sci-fi and film noir all combined as it's definitely a comic book movie not for kids due to some language, gory violence and sexuality  but more for adult audiences.

The major companies try to get their hands on every franchise they possibly can. The real question is once there is a movie in play how will translate to the big screen and who is the fan base? Well, we all have seen what `The Dark Knight' and `Spider-Man' have done. Still, what about the no so main stream novels such as `300'? There are directors out there that don't want to make a movie in their own vision, but yet they wish to bring the book to the screen word for word, page for page. That is the film 'Watchmen'.<br /><br />'Watchmen' may be the biggest cult fan based comic book of all time. Written in an alternate reality in the 1980s, the Cold War is very much alive and all of Earth is extremely concerned about nuclear war. The heroes in this world are not ones special abilities or powers, and they are not liked by the people. Though, the costumed crusaders prevail to keep the people in line and keep order in the world. Suddenly one of them is brutally murdered and they are now the ones who fear extinction.<br /><br />I made it my business to make sure I read the graphic novel before I went to see this film and it was a wise choice. This movie no doubt tried to remain as faithful to the comic as possible. The dialogue was melancholy, they characters were well casted and while there were not as many effects as a major comic book blockbuster it was still put together in a very artsy package. Though, this movie is truly not for the mainstream movie goers. Watchmen was definitely created with the true comic book fan in mind. The director Zack Snyder like on his previous work with `300' wanted to make a movie that was just as authentic as the pages it was first concocted upon. Those who read this story would definitely enjoy it even though it is a very slow movie dragged out story. There are a few major things that are changed for cinematic purposes, but after reading this story I believe that the changes made really made the story more believable and less confusing.  The changing of the costumes was a positive thing because some of those characters really looked like pimped out hood ornaments in print. The actors chosen were not well known which is always a great thing. They each filled their roles perfectly and it really made me feel like the comic book was actually coming to life before my eyes. I believe that if you read the book definitely pick the movie up. If you are an innovative person who wants to see something different then you might enjoy it as well. But, I think if you are looking for the typical action super-hero flick let this one pass you by, you might not understand it. Alan Moore may have officially removed himself from any film that his work was to become, but I believe he needs to see this one, because it really has done him justice. Watchmen came out at the right time because Zack Snyder got it right.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9V37MS6QY8D.html">AE9V37MS6QY8D</a><br/><p>The thing about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0930289234">Watchmen</a> is that it's a book about costumed heroes (the only "superhero" of the lot is Dr. Manhattan) and some may rule it off as "just another comic book." But it should be given some merit for the single fact that Time magazine named it one of the 100 best novels (not graphic or comics, just novels) of all time. Most were worried that such an intense story was unfilmable. A lot of directors and studio execs had tried to bring it to the screen but their efforts fell short before production even began. Then came director Zach Snyder (fresh off just adapting Frank Miller's graphic novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LF2WCC">300: The Complete Experience (Blu-ray Book + Digital Copy and BD-Live) [Blu-ray</a>]), and all fell into place. Now, the movie is out and I can't rave enough about it!<br /><br />A quick synopsis of the story, by legendary writer Alan Moore and artist<br />Dave Gibbons, is that, in an alternate 1985 where Richard M. Nixon is<br />still President of the U.S. and when masked heroes have been outlawed,<br />a long-time costumed hero/government agent, Edward Blake, is murdered<br />and another costumed hero/vigilante, Rorschach, suspects that there is<br />a serial killer picking off costumed heroes. Through the overall plot,<br />each main character's backstory is explored (think TV's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0021L8FO4">Lost: The Complete Seasons 1-5</a>, which co-creators Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse admit to Watchmen being a major influence) as five major ex-costumed heroes try to bring the killer to justice. The story isn't just full of action, violence, nudity and cussing -- it's got plenty of that. But it's also about the deep psychology and philosophy rooted in superhero mythology; i.e., separation from one's own humanity and dealing with all the drama and mess that comes with life; living an impotent life when not doing what you feel destined to do; being an uncompromising force in a world that needs compromise; giving in to a lie that you believe will help billions of others; and not facing up to a past of lies that you swore your life by. Each character confronts their own inner demons (most of which made them get into the costumed hero business in the first place), while trying to solve the overall mystery of the killer's motive.<br /><br />I'm a fan of the graphic novel (albeit not one of those diehard fans) and thoroughly enjoyed the film adaptation. I wouldn't compare it to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GZ6QDS">The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy)</a> per se because the two movies are different in the sense that "Knight" portrays a character that has many stories to choose from, while Watchmen is a compacted story with a beginning and an ending. Whereas Batman is allowed to have a sequel because there are several stories to tell, Watchmen has one single story and it's told in all its brilliance. And the movie perfectly captures it all. BTW, just the thought of a sequel to "Watchmen" makes me shudder in disgust.<br /><br />I had heard that some content would be cut from the film, but what was cut was small and didn't make a major difference to the quality of the film. And the ending that Snyder and co. did change made the film better IMHO. One of my favorite aspects ofthe film is that it shows in many ways how screwed up in the head that masked heroes would have to be to do what they do. One of the best scenes is a small scene where Dan/Nite Owl II and Laurie/Silk Spectre II are talking at dinner about an old foe of theirs who dressed up and did crime just so he could be beaten for sexual gratification. When asking what happened to the foe, Dan tells Laurie that he tried it with tough guy Rorschach and the vigilante dropped him down an elevator shaft. After hearing the news, Laurie abrupts in hysterical laughter to which Dan shortly follows suit (in the book, they laugh a lot harder); and I think that the fact that they find it funny proves how twisted they are. A well-played and well-written scene among many.<br /><br />I won't lie that there is extreme violence in the film and it's not for<br />the faint of heart, but the overall story is magnificent, nonetheless.<br />The use of music was brilliant and the fact that Snyder used classic<br />songs (Bob Dylan's "The Times They Are-A Changing," Nat King Cole's<br />"Unforgettable," Simon and Garfunkel's "Sounds of Silence," Leonard<br />Cohen's "Hallelujah," just to name a few) was compellingly appropriate<br />seeing how they accompany a comic adaptation that many consider the<br />classic of all comic stories. Not since the use of Jimi Hendrix's "Hey<br />Joe" in "Forrest Gump" have songs been so perfectly matched to a scene!<br /><br />I commend Snyder and company for their adaptation to a graphic novel that<br />everyone said was unfilmable. I thought the movie was superb! I just<br />can't say enough good things about it. I could go on more about this<br />film but then I'd have to get into talking about specific scenes that<br />might spoil the movie and its plot, so I'll digress. If you're a fan of<br />ANY superhero/costumed hero comic book movie or comic books in general,<br />just see the movie. Of course, it's always better to read the book. And<br />most diehard fans are going to notice the differences but I know that<br />what works in a book (as well as its length) might not always work in a<br />movie. If Snyder didn't put enough in, people would complain about<br />that. But if he puts too much in, people (critics) complain about that.<br />I thought he put in the perfect amount, which was nearly everything.<br />This will definitely be one of the best, most epic comic book movies<br />ever ... if not the greatest. See. This. Movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>Not familiar with the graphic novels, I can only state my opinion regarding the film. When I first saw the trailer for Watchmen, I instantly knew it was the greatest movie trailer I have ever seen, and probably will see. It was like nothing I had ever witnessed. I was hooked without knowing literally anything about the film, the comics, the characters, or the plot.<br /><br />Upon watching it, I knew I liked it alot, but wasn't sure whether I loved it. With so much packed into movie that-even at 3 hours, is a bit short- I knew it would require multiple viewings before I could form a proper opinion. The plot is a bit confusing and so much is going on at the same time, that it becomes difficult to keep track of everything, unless you are familiar with the graphic novels, I assume.<br /><br />Character-wise, I thought everyone did a fantastic job. Dr. Manhattan and Rorschach were my two faves. I love characters with depth and mystery, and they had both in abundance. The rest of the cast is just as strong and well-balanced in film.<br /><br />The special effects are just ridiculously awesome. There really cannot be one single complaint about anything visual on screen.<br /><br />Plot-wise, I think the director did a fine job in the allotted time and while convoluted and messy at times, it was still enjoyable enough to keep my interest for the entire film-and wish for even more.<br /><br />A word of caution, though by now everyone probably has figured out that this film is quite adult in every regard and cannot be put in the same league as your standard comic book films. This is not Spiderman. It is not even Batman. This is a very graphic  anti-superhero film with enough blood, language, nudity, violence and sexual content to keep any ADULT happily engaged. I do not, under any circumstances, recommend anyone under the age of 17 to watch this.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>This is one of those films that -- if you read and re-read the book as so many have -- you look forward to with both anticipation and a bit of dread. Because they could so easily have screwed this up. But I'm pleased, and a little surprised, to find that the film follows the book pretty closely -- in all the important ways. Because the book isn't really about superhero crimefighters. It's about people, both good and bad, and how they fit together. And the film pulls it off very well. The character of the uncompromisingly absolutist Rorschach, the most interesting character in both the book and the film, is very nicely rendered. Even Dr. Manhattan, the least "human" character, is portrayed in multiple dimensions. I think they made a good decision in not giving any of the roles to a headlining actor. No Nicholas Cage, no Gwyneth Paltrow to steal the scenes. You can pay attention to the roles the actors are playing, not the actors themselves. And, yeah, there's a lot of gore in this film, . . . but that's a human thing, too. Even the fight scenes are more explicit than you would expect (this is definitely not a kids' film), but that's to make a point. Because there's also a morality tale here about how things can so easily go wrong with society. The world is facing nuclear annihilation and it's largely because the forces of violently coercive conservatism are in control -- typified by the Comedian, who kills women and children without batting an eye, and by the fact that Richard Nixon is in his fifth term as president. Even Dan Dreibeg and Laurie Jupiter, the putative Good Guys, are out there on the right wing somewhere, trying to make the world their version of a "better place." This take on the 1980s is not the Good Old Days that might have been. And, of course, there's the overarching question: Is it right to do great evil in the successful pursuit of even greater good? The film actually seems much more explicit than the book about the "alternate universe" aspect of the story, right from the outset in the credits -- which do a very nice job of summarizing the back-story, incidentally. But let's face it, a lot of people went to see this flick for the special effects, and those are great -- and without getting in the way of the live action, which is quite an accomplishment. Especially everything surrounding Dr. Manhattan. There are lots of great quotable lines, most of them directly from the book. My favorite: "None of you seem to understand. I'm not locked in here with you. You're locked in here with me." The choice of `80s songs for the soundtrack also is very interesting; most of them fit the atmosphere of the story, even the actual plotline. (Except for "99 Luft Balloons": What in the world is that doing in there?) All in all, an excellent screen version of an excellent book. I expect to be revisiting both of them at regular intervals in the future. I do miss the giant alien squid, though.</p></br><a href="../users/AAKGTWGAFT1LQ.html">AAKGTWGAFT1LQ</a><br/><p>I am a fan of the Watchmen movie, preferably the 'Director's Cut' version.<br />Because I wasn't familiar with the source material , I could watch the film without preconceptions.<br />I first watched it without the sound on, just reading the subtitles.<br />Sleeping babies can affect your movie watching capabilities. I was able to take in purely the visual aspect of it - on that basis alone, the film succeeded for me.<br /><br />Hearing it with the sound on changes the emotional tone completely - it is even more dramatic. I do wonder how it would have been with hardly any music. It does not need much.<br /><br />Now, after watching the Director's Cut a few more times, I've begun to make more sense of it. I realise that the film is all about people who are coming to terms with their lives and that some are not afraid to make drastically dangerous decisions, without concern for morality. For this reason, it can be a hard film to sit through. There are periods in the film (such as the trip to another planet) where two of the characters talk and one of them mentions how it is so scientifically fascinating that a person is born - the event of life creation is described in beautiful language. The scene has a great sadness and weight to it, seeming somehow timeless.<br /><br />At the same time, the film has some quite violent sections. I hope this gives you an idea of how much is going on in it.<br /><br />All the actors fit their roles incredibly well, the world of the movie is believable, effects work seamlessly and overall it is an offbeat and rather long movie - demanding is an accurate word.<br />It is very dark and explores failure as a theme, similar to 'The Dark Knight'. Perhaps part of the reason the film got made is good timing - 'The Dark Knight' was very successful and took the superhero movie somewhere else.<br /><br />I recommend you rent it to see what you think of it - whether you look at the source material is up to you.<br />If you find yourself intrigued by the film, you will likely then need time to watch it again as you felt able to 'take it in' over several viewings, which is what worked for me.<br />You could call it a drama with a comic book aspect or vice versa.<br />I'm glad it got made and that it has caused such intense scrutiny.<br />I don't plan to read the source material - after all, some of us just want to see the film, not read the book.<br />What a film it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>It's almost impossible to throw too much praise on The Watchmen. It is one of the 100 best films ever made and the greatest page to screen adaptation done in this century. It's a film for people who enjoy the art of making a great motion picture, it is a pleasure to behold, seeing it is a plain and simple awesome experience. It is also one of those rare examples of a movie actually being better than its original source material, which in itself was a brilliant act of innovation. All that said, The Watchmen also has some nice blue penis shots, and it's hard to go wrong with blue penis scenes. Seriously, though, if there is anything better than seeing The Watchmen for the first time in the big screen, it's seeing it for the first time on Blu-ray. Absolutely and unreservedly recommended to all. A bargain at many times the asking price. If you want to go to Heaven when you die, you'd better buy The Watchmen now, because the end of the world is coming and I hear it's God's favorite flick!</p></br><a href="../users/A3USRUCHAOC3MT.html">A3USRUCHAOC3MT</a><br/><p>I could start out with the line from Dave Mason's classic song:  "There are no good guys, there are no bad guys, there's only you and me and we just disagree."<br /><br />Most superhero movies deal with people who are basically moral and upright, where the villains are usually evil, and where the focus is on PG-13 rated action.  This movie blurs the distinction between good and evil, where the heroes are no less violent (and in some cases no less murderous) than the villains.  The result in fairly nihlistic, that there is really no meaning to everything.  In another sense, it is existential, where we create our own meaning.<br /><br />I am giving this five stars.  Why?  Because it is a well crafted story.  It gives you opportunity to know the characters psychologically rather than the typical two dimensional stereotypes where the emphasis is on the action instead of on the person.  (The recent Batman series comes closest to this, with honorable mention to the X-Men Trilogy.)  It is a long movie, but that's because it doesn't rush the story.<br /><br />There were many reasons I could have given it a lower rating.  Some are purely subjective, such as the dark and bleak outlook of the movie.  Some are due to feeling this being an R-Rated movie with a lot of vile language, too graphic violence, and going all out on the nude scene with Night Owl II and Silk Spectre II-- a lot of that seeming gratituous.<br /><br />This is, as just said, an R-Rated movie.  Teenagers don't need to see this movie.  Personally, I think they don't need to be exposed to that hopeless a philosophy any more than to the sex and violence.  In other words, I long for the days of the Batman TV series.  But maybe Silk Spectre I was right -- the future looks darker and the past looks brighter.  I just would like to do more to brighten the future.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A long film that doesn't feel long, Watchmen is an astonishing visual experience (for all his faults director Zach Snyder sure can craft a pretty frame) that has its flaws--the scenes with Rorschach work far better than anything with Matthew Goode or Patrick Wilson and Malin Akerman, some of the flashbacks don't make much sense to neophytes--but Jackie Earle Haley is great, the CGI is very effective, and the film works as *spectacle* even when it fails a little as a story; no one can deny that Watchman has issues, but it succeeds despite them.<br /><br />3/4</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>While I love Superhero films (and am as knowledgeable about Superman, Batman, and most of the Marvel heroes as any comic book fan from the 'Silver Age'), I admit I was unfamiliar with Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' graphic novel "Watchmen", before watching the big screen version. I only knew that it was a different 'spin' on the 'Justice Society/Justice League' chronology, involving a unique set of heroes and an alternate version of our reality.<br /><br />"Watchmen", the movie, is much, much, more, and stands, with "The Dark Knight", as the most provocative, unconventional, and brilliant reinventions of the genre, since Tim Burton 'reinvented' Batman, in the eighties.<br /><br />First off, it debunks the classic superhero 'origin' story. These are not noble scientists or rich philanthropists, who don costumes to hide their indentities and achieve their 'higher calling'...many of this group were cops, who, when criminals discovered wearing masks and costumes made it impossible to identify and prosecute them, donned masks, themselves, to do what the courts couldn't: exact justice. Most of these 'costumed heroes' had no 'special skills' other than as brawlers, and the confrontations with masked criminals had more of a carnival sideshow 'feel' than anything really heroic. And these 'heroes', being regular people, had all the human foibles; some were sadists, one heroine was a lesbian, another would be raped, and all had some degree of ego problems. Yet the public loved them, and when, in the 40s, a group banded together, they achieved the same kind of public adoration as the Justice Society would, in their world. As time passed, however, age and changing mores would create a 'changing of the guard'...one hero, Nite Owl (a variation of Batman), would retire, replaced by a technology geek (Patrick Wilson), who added 'toys' large and small, to enhance his skills; another (Carla Gugino) would be replaced by her daughter (Malin Akerman); the world's richest, most brilliant intellectual (Matthew Goode) would use his resources to enhance his abilities and create a nearly superhuman persona; a child abuse victim (Jackie Earle Haley) would don a cowl with ever-changing patterns, and become a hard-core 'Dirty Harry'-type vigilante...and the world's first true 'superpowered' hero (Billy Crudup) would appear, a man who, when accidently bathed in nuclear energy, lost his physical form, becoming a nude blue creature of nearly limitless power, but a fading understanding of humanity. Joined by the one 'carry-over' from the first generation, the handsome, if disgusting 'Comedian' (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a new team is created...which is really where the movie begins!<br /><br />It is 1985, a caricatured version of Richard Nixon (Robert Wisden), is in his umpteenth term as President, the world is at the brink of nuclear war, and the 'superheroes', with the exception of Crudup's 'Dr. Manhattan', have been ordered to retire, following a carnage-fueled American 'victory' of the Vietnam war. Other than Haley ('Rorschach'), who went into hiding, everyone has complied, willingly...but when the Comedian is brutally murdered, and other ex-heroes are targeted, Rorschach suspects a far more sinister purpose than simply revenge, and tries, unsuccessfully, to get his former colleagues to join him in a search for answers. He was right, of course, and as we learn more about the heroes' lives and backstories, a truly riveting tale of ambition, morality, and 'greater good' emerges, that kept me 'hooked'. While I saw elements of Frank Miller's "The Dark Knight Returns" on several occasions, I'd never seen a universe so carefully and logically 'fleshed out', onscreen, and it was simply stunning.<br /><br />I won't give away anything else about this remarkable film...only to recommend it, enthusiastically, if you love this kind of film as much as I do...You won't be disappointed!</p></br><a href="../users/A26R4PDCZX5SOK.html">A26R4PDCZX5SOK</a><br/><p>I am very impressed with this movie; 5 of 5 stars. Just watched the extended Director's cut making it a very very long movie. The story is very complex with alot of flash-backs and even some flash-forwards.

I will have to see this movie a few times to completely digest and understand it; complex.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Watchmen (Zack Snyder, 2009)<br /><br />Dear Zack,<br /><br />May I still call you Zack, even after all those nasty things I said in my review of 300? I hope so, because I'm going to start out my review of Watchmen by taking them all back. I really don't hope you get eaten by wild dingoes in the middle of the night, and I have no intentions of making you into a delectable stew. Okay, 300 was still a monstrous desecration of its source material, but Watchmen is, for most of its length, as slavishly faithful as 300 was a departure. For a movie that's been in on-and-off development for almost twenty years, that was necessary, and adding in those shots that were made to look as much like the panels they were drawn from as possible was a wonderful touch. But more on this later.<br /><br />For those of you who have been in a cave for twenty years, Watchmen takes place in an alternate-universe 1985 in which superheroes exist. Well, one superhero exists, Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup). The rest of the Watchmen are just regular guys who dress up and fight crime with good old-fashioned brawn and technology. At least, that is, until the Keene Act, passed a few years previous, which outlawed masked vigilantes. Dr. Manhattan was appropriated by the government, of course, for as a military asset, he's incomparable--a nuclear scientist who, through a nasty accident, has become something much more than human. With him went Silk Spectre, now known as plain ol' Sally Jupiter (27 Dresses' Malin Akerman), Doc's girlfriend. The Comedian (The Accidental Husband's Jeffrey Dean Morgan) went into retirement, as did Nite Owl (Hard Candy's Patrick Wilson), who spends his weekends drinking beers with the original Nite Owl, Hollis Mason (Stephen McHattie, recently of Pontypool), the only former masked crusader to have gone public with his identity save Adrian Veidt (Brideshead Revisited's Matthew Goode), now a captain of industry). There was one other member of the Watchmen, Rorshach (Shutter Island's Jackie Earle Hailey). Rorschach ignored the ban, and still wanders at night in his mask and gloves, fighting street crime and doing voice-overs. (Rorschach is an obvious nod to Travis Bickle, but without the cab.) Now that all the players are set up, the movie opens with someone breaking into the Comedian's apartment and killing him, and Rorschach's appearance on the scene soon after. Combined with a few other events and portents, Rorschach comes to the conclusion that someone is stalking former masked vigilantes. His former colleagues initially dismiss the idea, but a few of them come around, Meanwhile, all is not well on the home front with Laurie and Dr. Manhattan; Doc's working with Veidt on an energy source that will revolutionize life as we know it (and neutralize the Soviet threat in the process), and Laurie's feeling lonely. Meanwhile, Manhattan (whose voice bears a startling resemblance to Hal's from 2001) has the charge leveled at him that his very presence may be giving those around him cancer, leading to him rethinking his remaining on Earth. It's all part of something bigger, of course, but in order to get to the bottom of it, the former friends will have to reforge old bonds, and sever even older ones, in their respective quests for truth.<br /><br />Simply put, Watchmen is one of the most dazzling visual spectacles I've ever seen, and it is so perfectly paced that it is also the fastest three hours I've ever spent watching a movie. (This is the directors' cut, natch.) I wasn't sure how much I expected from this cast, but that may have more to do with the fact that like most Watchmen fans I've been casting and recasting this thing in my head for decades. All of them do an outstanding job. Snyder's direction is the best I've seen from him, and as I said, for the most part, the adaptation is slavishly faithful to the original comic. (The bits from Hollis Mason's book are absent, as is Takes from the Black Freighter; both appeared on DVD as this hit theaters in animated form.) Of course, the big change, which involves the climax, has been the source of controversy since about ten seconds after the movie was released in theaters. Put me down with those who felt it intelligent, well-thought-out, and, if not better than the comic book's climax, as good. Simply put, I expected Watchmen to be watchable but throwaway; what I actually got surpassed my expectations in every possible way. One of the best movies I've seen in 2009. **** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A2AVV9LV9UXT6F.html">A2AVV9LV9UXT6F</a><br/><p>"Watchmen" when it debuted in mid '80s was a groundbreaking event in the world of comics.  Along with Frank Miller's "The Dark Knight Returns" it began to change the fundamental perceptions of comics -- that they were strictly kid stuff.  "Watchmen" helped establish that the comic book medium could be used to tell serious, thoughtful, adult-themed stories, that discriminating readers could enjoy and appreciate.  Now that Hollywood has discovered comic books as a source of movie ideas, and each comic book adaptation comes practically tripping on the heels of its predecessor, I suppose it was only a matter of time before "Watchmen" was translated to the silver screen.  It was worth the wait in this case.<br /><br />Most people familiar with comics will be familiar with Alan Moore's very public comments repudiating this movie, sight unseen, even to the point of denigrating its director.  Alan Moore needs to get over himself.  I understand he has good cause to feel disappointed with Hollywood, given the awfulness of some previous adaptations of his work.  But he has overreacted, like a kid who wants to take his ball and go home now.  He has declared "Watchmen" to be "unfilmable," which is interesting, since he clearly didn't always feel that way.  He was reportedly "enthusiastic" back in the '80s when he first sold the film rights to "Watchmen."  If it wasn't unfilmable then, why would it be now?  Moore seems to have lost the ability to tell the difference between a bad storytelling medium, and a good storytelling medium badly employed, and now his disappointment has fermented into petulance.  It's really a shame, because a movie adaptation of his work has finally done it justice.  It's far from perfect, and no doubt even if this exact movie could have been made back when he still had enthusiasm for the project, he'd disagree with some of the director's decisions.  But as it is, he's ironically decided to turn his back on films only when at last someone's done a film adaptation of his work that he might actually have liked.  Pity.  It's his loss.<br /><br />This really is a good film.  It's about as faithful to the graphic novel as a film could possibly be, given the changes that have to be made to adapt it into a movie, and keep the movie to a reasonable run time that audiences will be able to sit through.  The cast is nearly perfect.  All of the actors turn in solid performances, and Jackie Earl Haley and Jeffrey Dean Morgan really stand out in their roles.  Their performances are two of the reasons this is such a good adaptation.  The audience ends up perceiving the characters in precisely the same way they came across in the graphic novel.  In the comedian's case, we see an amoral, sometimes vicious man, and yet strangely, while never approving of him, don't quite hate him the way we ought to hate someone who has done the things he has.  In Rorschach, who seems to be the most popular character in both the graphic novel and the movie, we see a character who maintains a very black/white view of the world and the moral choices it presents us, and who is totally uncompromising and true to his beliefs, even to the point of being willing to die for them rather than compromising.  Perhaps this level of integrity and moral courage, as well as pure, unflinching toughness, is what causes people to like a character who is anti-social and violent, and more than a little crazy.  The other characters are almost as well done, but those two really stand out.  Once again, despite the changes made to bring this story to film, Moore really ought to get off his high horse and enjoy the movie for what it is, which is, on the whole, a faithful, respectful adaptation, which keeps the story and its themes fully intact, even if some of the details have to be changed for the medium.<br /><br />Not everything is translated faithfully from the source material, however.  The ending is significantly altered, but this is not a change which seems to hurt the film at all.  In fact a considerable body of opinion exists that it actually improved the story.<br /><br />But nothing is perfect, and the "Watchmen" movie is no exception.  Other changes, though more minor, are not so beneficial.  One example of this is the extreme, brutally graphic violence of some of the scenes.  Dan and Laurie's fight with the gang of muggers in the alley is a lot bloodier than in the book.  And in the director's cut, the assassination attempt on Veidt in his office is a LOT more brutal.  In the novel, we see a gunman step into view, fire at Veidt, and hit his secretary with one shot, and she falls over dead.  In the director's cut of the movie, she gets his twice twice, in super slo mo, with close ups on the impacts, one of which takes off several fingers of her right hand.  Then another bullet hits Lee Iacocca right between the eyes (and he wasn't even in the book).  And for the life of me, I can't see any way in which all this extra carnage improves the story one jot.  It adds nothing whatsoever to the story.  And speaking of the scene with Iacocca, the insertion of him into this movie, in a scene where he and several other corporate CEOs confront Veidt is by far the worst scene in the movie.  It's such a hamfisted, childish caricature of the evil rich capitalist fat cat, right down to one of the sinister plutocrats sneering "Free energy?  Free's just another word for for socialist.  We may just have to look into some of your past associations."  It comes across as just what it is, a Hollywood liberal's fantasy of what a rich conservative corporate executive is.  And again, it adds nothing to the story.  More minor flaws include Snyder's trademark overuse of slow motion, and Silk Spectre's magic boots, which are stiletto-heeled in any scene where she's just walking or standing, but flat-heeled when she fights bad guys.<br /><br />Still the flaws are fairly minor.  And I suppose they -- the consequence of having Zack Snyder as director -- are the price we must pay for the good fortune of having Zack Snyder as a director.  It was probably inevitable that he would insert such things into the movie, but he was also one of the only directors who appreciated the the original story enough to keep the changes minor, and stay as faithful to the novel as he did.  The result is a great movie, which can be enjoyed even by people who never read the graphic novel, but which will also please the novels longtime and devoted fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>I had a blast watching it. And now, the complaints.<br /><br />Some of the scenes lacked the impact of the graphic novel, strangely enough. The chief standout was the bar scene where Blake gets cut. The damage to his face has been greatly minimized, as though it were a mere scratch, and his words to Jon are devoid of emotional impact. This is the case for many scenes, where it seems the actors are rushing through their lines - a beat or two is sadly missing. This is evident, for example, when Daniel says, "What do you expect? The comedian is dead" (perhaps I paraphrase).<br /><br />There are some inspired shots, such as when we see Blake's tear navigating the rivulets of his face.<br /><br />The great Plot has been slightly changed, but to no great detriment. There are perhaps a few more left-wing jabs, but the thoughtful viewer will see that the entire constitutes a right-wing cautionary tale about "smarter" men making decisions for "the little people," and how far they are willing to go - to sacrifice (others) - to create a Utopia. There are also jabs at our coddling of evil. So there's plenty to be enjoyed (and frowned at) by viewers of almost all political leanings.<br /><br />The action that has been added all works for the good of the movie, although some of the violence is gratuitiously graphic, albeit in keeping with the graphic novel.<br /><br />All in all, an entertaining translation to screen. The sad thing is that many viewers will not ask the big question - is that the only way to bring about peace in a world of fallen beings? To create false crises, such as global cooling (in the 70's), then warming (80's to 90's? I dunno), then, when the earth started cooling in 2001 (search on "Climategate"), "climate change" instead? Perhaps this will be a wake-up call to search for the true meaning of man - the call to be something grander and nobler than the butt of a practical joke, rooted in the realization that our deepest longings are not just chemical illusions borne of atomic accidents, but are for something true and worthwhile that can only be found in Someone greater than ourselves.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I enjoyed the movie, which surprised me since I had pretty high expectations.  As a fan of the director(Dawn of the Dead, 300) I was really pleased at what he brought to the screen.  The series was 12 issues long with lots of panels and dialog, as well as a lengthy monologue.  So yes, it was a comic, but it really packed a lot into each page.  Though the movie ran nearly 3 hours, I honestly don't know what he could have cut to make it shorter without taking away any important plot points or character building sequences.  He managed to stay faithful to the comic and changed only the ending, which I thought was better than the comic ending anyway.  Fairly good casting is highlighted by Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach.  I was scratching my head when I first heard about this bit of casting, but he was truly phenomenal in his role and spot on with the comic.  This movie is a fairly solid R with some strong violence, sex scenes, nudity including blue penis and a little language, though that is fairly tame.  A good super hero movie and a very good adaptation of the comic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>I was not impressed by director Zack Snyder's efforts in "300."  While it was a visual feast with impressive special effects, I felt that Snyder used those visuals as a crutch to support a rather dull plot.  The actual historical account of the battle at Thermopylae was, to me, a much better story than Snyder's film or Frank Miller's graphic novel.<br /><br />With that said, I wasn't expecting much from Snyder's "Watchmen."  Based on the comic series by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, I thought that it would be just another special effects-laden, plotless film.  I was quite surprised.<br /><br />What Snyder has done is take a very good story and give it an excellent treatment on film.  From recreating panels with near perfection from the comics and retaining the bulk of the story, Snyder has outdone himself.<br /><br />The plot of the film revolves around the murder of one superhero, the Comedian, and the attempts of another, Rorshach, to discover the culprit.  Rorshach tries to drag other former heroes out of retirement with mixed results at first.  Eventually he gets Nite Owl II to help him in his quest.  Another pair of heroes, Silk Spectre II and Dr. Manhattan, also become involved, but they primarily struggle with themselves.  Silk Spectre is trying to find a reason to stay with Dr. Manhattan despite his becoming increasingly detached from her.  Dr. Manhattan has become bored with humanity and also accused of giving cancer to some of his colleagues and spends much of the film in solitude on Mars.  Another former hero, the very public Ozymandias, would rather keep his distance on all matters.<br /><br />As expected, Snyder does provide excellent special effects.  In fact, they are some of the best I've seen in the last couple of years.  Even the perpetually blue-glowing Dr. Manhattan looks rather convincing on the screen.<br /><br />Jackie Earle Haley rises above the rest of the cast as Rorshach, the primary catalyst in the film.  He keeps the tale interesting throughout.  He's a tortured soul intent on finding the murderer of his former ally.  Patrick Wilson does an excellent job as the depressed Nite Owl II, who's all but thrown in the towel on being a superhero.  He's somewhat like Batman had Bruce Wayne quit hitting the gym and became a homebody.  Billy Crudup does a good job as Dr. Manhattan, giving a cold and nearly emotionless performance.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays the rather unlikeable Comedian, who appears primarily in flashbacks.  He's a disgusting jerk and quite possibly the ultimate anti-hero.  Carla Gugino portrays the original Silk Spectre, and shines as a drunken, washed-up former hero.<br /><br />The only real disappointments in the acting department were Matthew Goode and Malin Akerman.  Goode just wasn't believable as the super-intelligent old soul called Ozymandias.  His performance was very flat.  Still, he wasn't as bad as Malin Akerman, who delivers a wooden and emotionless performance as Silk Spectre II.  Akerman comes across as a likeable person in real life, but I felt that she wasn't the right person for this particular role.<br /><br />Despite the subpar efforts of Goode and Akerman, I felt that "Watchmen" was a very good film.  Loyal to the source material, full of tormented characters, and giving the viewer a very unique spin on the mythos of superheroes, I highly recommend "Watchmen."  It's a definite purchase for fans of the comic serial and anyone who enjoys an excellent mystery or solid action.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>let me be blunt, i really didn't know too much about these characters, well i never heard of them before now, well the movie was really good and sexy, i loved it. but to be true it was not for little kids. i think this movie was not meant for children. it was diffrent than your original superhero movie. i guesse thats why i liked it so much. i hope the graphic novel is good. the books usually are better than the movies. i hope the game will be awesome when ever they make it. well thats it peace.

Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) can no longer see the future and he believes the reason is nuclear holocaust.<br /><br />One of the last masked superheroes takes a fall from his highrise apartment to the ground below. The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) was a precarious mixture of good and evil and someone finally took him out while he was watching television.<br /><br />The US government led by 5 term president, Richard M. Nixon (Robert Wisden) has outlawed masked heroes. Only Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) is still on the streets trying to fight crime.  He's trying desperately to find the man who killed the Comedian, but none of his old co-horts seems to care.<br /><br />This is just the setup for "The Watchmen" Spring 2009's predicted blockbuster.  The film, which runs at an impressive 163 minutes, is based on Alan Moore's acclaimed graphic novel.  The director, Zack Snyder, used a great deal of Dave Gibbons's original art as a storyboard for the film and it really does show.<br /><br />Two of the most compelling actors in this story are Haley as the crusading Rorschach, who still believes in the superheroes and helping his own, and the Morgan, who plays an intense Comedian whose actions make one wonder why even Rorschach wouldn't be better off just walking away.<br /><br />The CGI for this film is spectacular, but be warned, the action is quite real and not for the squeamish or very young. Violence against women and children is particularly rough, but faithful to what I remember from the originals.  I admit, seeing real actors conveying the story is quite a bit different than looking at one dimensional drawings and for me, the film had much more impact.<br /><br />The music is some of the most evocative of the 60's, 70's and 80's, including "Hallelujah" by Leonard Cohen and "Sounds of Silence" by Simon and Garfunkel.<br /><br />I can't speak to the faithfulness to the original work. I read the story back when they were still comics and CGI wasn't even a gleam in a geek's eye.  And yet, so many of the characters and thoughts from this novel have haunted me for years.<br /><br />I will probably see the film again and will definitely purchase the soundtrack.  "Watchmen" is well worth 3 hours of your time and if you're like me, you will be thinking of the film for some time to come.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, March 2009</p></br><a href="../users/A27P0MW8TE1JQP.html">A27P0MW8TE1JQP</a><br/><p>1st: WATCHMEN is an amazing film adaptation of an amazing graphic novel and you need to see it ( and read it)...<br /><br />2nd : Neither the film nor the graphic novel is for kids...this ain't the Incredibles (although there are obvious intention parallels on Pixar's part). WATCHMEN is rated R for sex, intense violence and big blue full frontal from the only true super-powered super hero in the mix, Dr. Manhattan. This is actually fairly distracting in IMAX,  but props to the director for refusing to put pants on the guy (yes he does wear pants at some point but this part is true the comic).<br /><br />If you've never heard of the WATCHMEN now is a good time to learn.... Comic book fans, like myself have been waiting over 20 years for the big screen live action version...Alan Moore's 12 part comic mini-series which coined the term "Graphic Novel" and established the genre's ability to aspire to the ranks of literature (Time Magazine ranked it in the 100 greatest novels of the 20th century 1923-2005)...set in the year it was published WATCHMEN tells the story of cold war era world with masked heroes (forced into retirement) who are being killed off. More importantly the story centers on the deconstruction of the "super hero" exploring the flawed heroes of two generations of vigilantes. In addition to having lots of costumed heroes around History is different is that President Nixon is still president, currently serving his 5th term thanks to have won Vietnam, using the god-like power of Dr. Manhattan. In fact Dr. M's power is the only thing keeping the super-powers in check, but nuclear war still seems inevitable.<br />In less than typical fashion, hero origins and backstories are told throughout the movie through flashbacks, some more brutal than others. Although WATCHMEN was a DC comic it isn't set in the DC Universe of Superman and Batman.<br /><br />But you can tell your players without a  program...The next generation of heroes following in the footsteps of their post-WW II predecessors the MINUTEMEN are...<br /><br />The NITE OWL II aka Dan Dreilberg, the Batman like hero desperate to get back in action in his the Owl-looking air-vehicle, Dan is probably most heroic and the least flawed of all the characters.<br /><br />The SILK SPECTRE aka Laurie Juspeczyk, her mother was one of the original Minutemen and Laurie inheirents the role. Gets involved with Dr. M and the Nite Owl.<br /><br />RORSCHACH  aka Walter Kovacs, kind of a hard-boiled-detective-with-a-grappling-hook, Rorschach is trying to catch the "Mask Murder" and probably has more problems than any other character in the story, the villains included.<br /><br />DOCTOR MANHATTAN aka Jon Osterman, the result of an "accident in the lab" Dr. M is the only super-powered character and is blue.<br /><br />OZYMANDIAS aka Adrian Veidt is the self-styled world's smartest/fittest man. Veidt fancies himself akin to Alexander the Great and is the only hero with the wherewithal to create his OWN action figure line.<br />The COMEDIAN aka Edward Blake is the murder victim of the "Mask Killer" and ex-owner of the iconic-bloody-smiley. Blake is a mercenary feared by the bad guys as well as the good guys. Imagine a sadistic, over-sexed Capt. America.<br /><br />It has nearly panel per panel recreated the original comic composition of Moore's artist co-creator Dave Gibbons.... the dialogue is almost identical and very few edits were made (biggest cut was the comic-within-the-comic "the Black Freighter" which was animated to be released later in full (it is likely that the film pacing is better for the cut). The casting is perfect and thankfully mostly low profile "unknown" actors.  The costuming and effects are equally incredible. The art direction, from Alex McDowell and Francois Auduoy,  is on a scale of it's own, with attention to detail that is overwhelmingly accurate to the backstory and lesser details of the graphic novel.<br /><br />A great and complex look at "super-heroes." Like the graphic novel, WATCHMEN the movie, truly explores the highs and lows of the human experience, with or without capes, Moore's words are still powerful and with a running time of under 3 hours, I say, why so short?</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>This film, based on the graphic novels, seems to be draped in darkness with the exception of the blue glowing Dr. Manhattan. This use of darkness reminded me of the film Blade Runner but also reminded me of the paintings of the Renaissance where all characters are presented in darkness illuminated sometimes by strong light with the exception of Christ, often glowing as if illuminated from inside his body. Thus there are some loosely associated similarities to Christ entering a dark world which does not understand him and Dr. Manhattan's transformation and evolution and eventual distancing himself from the human condition and perspective as his vistas grow and he seems to take on the impersonal cognitions of a distant God.<br /><br />The use of an alternative past as the setting for the film allowed for political commentary, particularly about political opportunism and short-sightedness, as evidenced in the character of Richard Nixon.<br /><br />Yet in many ways it is also a film noir with all the dark puzzle pieces of a private detective film from the 1940's. There were some very strong performances including Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the Comedian, a superhero with strong sociopathic and violent tendencies. However Jackie Earle Haley steals the entire film with his outstanding performance as Rorschach. This bundle of pent up and everlasting rage is often more than the other heroes can endure. Haley's wild scenes in prison are worth the price of the film and his dialogue is darkly wicked. Billy Crudup plays Dr. Manhattan, a character that links Christ and physics in one character struggling to be both human and God. The character of Jesus has this same duality since Jesus is both God and human. Thus Dr. Manhattan struggles to remain attached to the human world and its emotional attachments while at the same time he is mastering the mysteries of the physical universe. Christ feels compassion for his fellow humans and it is this quality that Dr. Manhattan is losing or nearly loses in the film. There is much speculation around why Dr. Manhattan is naked with blue genitals. But this links him to Adam, for he is a first and unique being.  Malin Akerman is spectacular as Silk Spectre II, the force that eventually convinces Dr. Manhattan that the human race is worthy of redemption. Patrick Wilson plays Nite Owl II as the more human, humble competitor for Silk Spectre II's affection. He plays this part very well, rising to heroics gradually as his testosterone levels rise.  Matthew Goode never convinces us that Ozymandias was ever a team player with the other heroes so his later antics don't seem much like betrayal. The storyline is pure entertainment and draws from a thousand references and plots. It is predictable and yet the film is fully entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A331OF34UX4Y1K.html">A331OF34UX4Y1K</a><br/><p>SPOILERS BELOW.<br /><br />I just loved this movie. Bear in mind that I usually do not like movies like Transformers, 2012, the Michael Bay ones, Con Air, Mission Impossible (the second part is the worst of all) stuff like that. Also, I also go for comic adaptations with suspicious. But, after "IRON MAN", I thought they could really work.<br /><br />I was  in the middle of part five of the graphic novel (yes, that's a sin, never read it before), when I watched the movie. I don't know if it was the good mood I was in the day, whatever, but the movie got me by the opening sequence and I never got bored or disappointed. I just loved it, every single bit of it (and, like it semms to be the case with many fans, Roscharch was my favorite character.<br /><br />First, up until I had read the novel, I thought it was a faithful adaptation. Second, the cinematography was spectacular. Casting and costume design were on the spot, it was like the comics were alive. And, thankfuly, the editing was great. You could see the fights, see what's happening, instead of these modern lightning-cut editing tha people seem to enjoy today.<br /><br />The adpaptation was clearly handled with care and affection by people involved; However, I can understand some negative points mentioned by some reviewers. We must remember director Snyder was behind cameras in DAWN OF THE DEAD and 300 (which I did not like at all). So, he clearly enjoys some gore. But, overall, given the lenght of the movie and the potential scenes to use graphical gore, he kept his instincts at bay... He only goes for it with full throttle in the scene when Roscharch kills the raper. Also, thre is Dr. Manhattan pulverizing Vietnamese people, The Comedian killing a pregnant woman,the overall annihilation of a number of cities around the world. But these last ones are done without so much graphic description. And, remember: the scenes (or at least the idea) ARE in the comics!<br /><br />Like I said, I loved this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>Watchmen is one of those properties that you have to be extremely careful with when adapting it into a film. After all, it is considered to be one of the greatest novels ever and you will receive extreme backlash if you ruin it. Had this film not received the right group of people to do it, it would have ended up being a modern-day <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790732912">Batman & Robin</a>. People have still not forgiven Joel Schumacher for that effort even after 12 years. Watchmen, in my opinion is the most faithful film adaptation of any book, game, or movie remake adaptation ever made. Sure there have been plenty of great comic adaptations as of late such as;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNTX">Sin City</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GZ6QC4">The Dark Knight (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C08RHA">Iron Man (Single-Disc Edition)</a>, and more, but this easily stands as the greatest comic adaptation I've ever seen, and one of the greatest films I've ever seen, period.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The year is 1985, during the Cold War when tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union are ever growing and the possibility of war is evident. President Nixon is running for a fifth term in office, and we won the Vietnam war thanks to a band of heroes known as the "Watchmen" who were banned by the Keene Act in 1977. When an old super hero known as The Comedian is murdered, the other old Watchmen members band together to solve this murder and along the way unravel a series of shocking discoveries in a plot to kill these heroes and destroy the world along the way. Meanwhile, the world is on edge as nuclear wars comes closer and closer to fruition. Can the Watchmen save the world? Watch this superb film and find out.<br />MUSIC: The music in this film is simply amazing. Ranging from Tyler Bates's amazing score, to the numerous great old songs played throughout, this another highlight in this incredible experience. I have no gripes at all with this area.<br />ACTING: Although this film uses a cast of unknown people (The only person I recognized was Carla Gugino who was on Sin City), these actors fit their roles perfectly. These actors were absolutely fantastic and performed their roles superbly and flawlessly. I can't think of any actors would have performed these roles better.<br />ACTION: This film is a mostly story-driven experience, but when the action starts up, it can be rather brutal and gory in terms of violence. This is certainly not for kids and it earns its R-rating with no problem. The film had plenty of excitement throughout thanks to the wonderfully scripted action sequences. This film also features what some have referred to as a "gratuitous" scene of sexuality which makes this film definitely targeted to an adult audience. Not to mention, no one who sees this film is ever going to forget Dr. Manhattan's genitals (Does this glowing blue guy really need to be naked all the time?). This film will not disappoint those who are up some pretty cool action scenes and adult-only content.<br />OVERALL: This film is a must-have if you love comic book films, or you like films that really make you think (This film does teach moral values along the way). And if you buy this film, only buy the Director's Cut because this version is 24 minutes longer than the original version. This film is an absolutely fantastic, superb, and sublime experience. However, if you get bored easily, I would not recommend this to you because this version is three hours long. Buy this film now, dammit.<br />THE GOOD: Virtually everything.<br />THE BAD: Why is Dr. Manhattan almost always nude?</p></br><a href="../users/AE9V37MS6QY8D.html">AE9V37MS6QY8D</a><br/><p>The thing about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0930289234">Watchmen</a> is that it's a book about costumed heroes (the only "superhero" of the lot is Dr. Manhattan) and some may rule it off as "just another comic book." But it should be given some merit for the single fact that Time magazine named it one of the 100 best novels (not graphic or comics, just novels) of all time. Most were worried that such an intense story was unfilmable. A lot of directors and studio execs had tried to bring it to the screen but their efforts fell short before production even began. Then came director Zach Snyder (fresh off just adapting Frank Miller's graphic novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LF2WCC">300: The Complete Experience (Blu-ray Book + Digital Copy and BD-Live) [Blu-ray</a>]), and all fell into place. Now, the movie is out and I can't rave enough about it!<br /><br />A quick synopsis of the story, by legendary writer Alan Moore and artist<br />Dave Gibbons, is that, in an alternate 1985 where Richard M. Nixon is<br />still President of the U.S. and when masked heroes have been outlawed,<br />a long-time costumed hero/government agent, Edward Blake, is murdered<br />and another costumed hero/vigilante, Rorschach, suspects that there is<br />a serial killer picking off costumed heroes. Through the overall plot,<br />each main character's backstory is explored (think TV's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0021L8FR6">Lost: The Complete Seasons 1-5 [Blu-ray</a>], which co-creators Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse admit to Watchmen being a major influence) as five major ex-costumed heroes try to bring the killer to justice. The story isn't just full of action, violence, nudity and cussing -- although, it's got that. But it's also about the deep psychology and philosophy rooted in superhero mythology; i.e., separation from one's own humanity and dealing with all the drama and mess that comes with life; living an impotent life when not doing what you feel destined to do; being an uncompromising force in a world that needs compromise; giving in to a lie that you believe will help billions of others; and not facing up to a past of lies that you swore your life by. Each character confronts their own inner demons (most of which made them get into the costumed hero business in the first place), while trying to solve the overall mystery of the killer's motive.<br /><br />I'm a fan of the graphic novel (albeit not one of those diehard fans) and thoroughly enjoyed the film adaptation. I wouldn't compare it to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GZ6QEC">The Dark Knight (+ Digital Copy and BD Live) [Blu-ray</a>] per se because the two movies are different in the sense that "Knight" portrays a character that has many stories to choose from, while "Watchmen" is a compacted story with a beginning and an ending. Whereas Batman is allowed to have a sequel because there are several stories to tell, "Watchmen" has one single story and it's told in all its brilliance. And the movie perfectly captures it all. BTW, just the thought of a sequel to "Watchmen" makes me shudder in disgust.<br /><br />I had heard that some content would be cut from the film, but what was cut was small and didn't make a major difference to the quality of the film. And the ending that Snyder and co. did change made the film better IMHO. One of my favorite aspects ofthe film is that it shows in many ways how screwed up in the head that masked heroes would have to be to do what they do. One of the best scenes is a small scene where Dan/Nite Owl II and Laurie/Silk Spectre II are talking at dinner about an old foe of theirs who dressed up and did crime just so he could be beaten for sexual gratification. When asking what happened to the foe, Dan tells Laurie that he tried it with tough guy Rorschach and the vigilante dropped him down an elevator shaft. After hearing the news, Laurie abrupts in hysterical laughter to which Dan shortly follows suit (in the book, they laugh a lot harder); and I think that the fact that they find it funny proves how twisted they are. A well-played and well-written scene among many.<br /><br />I won't lie that there is extreme violence in the film and it's not for<br />the faint of heart, but the overall story is magnificent, nonetheless.<br />The use of music was brilliant and the fact that Snyder used classic<br />songs (Bob Dylan's "The Times They Are-A Changing," Nat King Cole's<br />"Unforgettable," Simon and Garfunkel's "Sounds of Silence," Leonard<br />Cohen's "Hallelujah," just to name a few) was compellingly appropriate<br />seeing how they accompany a comic adaptation that many consider the<br />classic of all comic stories. Not since the use of Jimi Hendrix's "Hey<br />Joe" in "Forrest Gump" have songs been so perfectly matched to a scene!<br /><br />I commend Snyder and company for their adaptation to a graphic novel that<br />everyone said was unfilmable. I thought the movie was superb! I just<br />can't say enough good things about it. I could go on more about this<br />film but then I'd have to get into talking about specific scenes that<br />might spoil the movie and its plot, so I'll digress. If you're a fan of<br />ANY superhero/costumed hero comic book movie or comic books in general,<br />just see the movie. Of course, it's always better to read the book. And<br />most diehard fans are going to notice the differences but I know that<br />what works in a book (as well as its length) might not always work in a<br />movie. If Snyder didn't put enough in, people would complain about<br />that. But if he puts too much in, people (critics) complain about that.<br />I thought he put in the perfect amount, which was nearly everything.<br />This will definitely be one of the best, most epic comic book movies<br />ever ... if not the greatest. See. This. Movie!</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>-This is more like 3.5 stars but Amazon does not give us that half star to use.  I've read comic books and graphic novels my whole life.  However, I reached the "enough is enough" phase some time ago with turning comic books into mega movie sensations.  I was not expecting to like this one very much but was pleased by its art and style.  Once again though, we have the overly long story of good vs. evil rendered in the usual black and white epic notes.  One vivid difference between WATCHMEN the comic and the movie is that the movie is painted so very much better than the comic was drawn.  The great strength of the comic was Alan Moore's writing.  The art was only so-so.  No one could ever call the art and style of the movie so-so.  It is straight out fabulous. This was a UK work but the action has been transplanted to the USA where Richard Nixon has been in office many terms and is still in office.  It is 1985.<br /><br />The plot is whether the cadre of super heroes known as the Watchmen can save the world from an about to be nuclear war and annihilation. The Watchmen are all retired when this dire event occurs and even worse, someone is out to kill them.  The first killing is of the one known as the Comedian. Rorsach, with the shifting ink blot face, wanders the noir streets to warn all the former Watchmen and to bring them back together as a pack.Their powers are pretty sensational and the movie opens with our seeing the Watchmen in action years ago, including winning the Vietnam War.<br /><br />The first hour of this film was terrific and then with every hour we lost ground.  By the last hour, I was strumming my fingers, fast losing interest.<br /><br />The problem is that every one of these comic book movies is so much alike.  We have a story line that is extreme evil and extreme good  battling some big end, either the end of a planet or at least a country. It is done with great verve and style, looking fabulous throughout. But it is the same story, again and again and again, ad infinitum.</p></br><a href="../users/A34KBK8ORA5GRV.html">A34KBK8ORA5GRV</a><br/><p>BLU-RAY VERSION IS WORTH BUYING.

A faded gang of superheroes lay dormant until one of their own is murdered, prompting an investigation that leads to a startling discovery about the future of the world and what the cost of peace and the salvation of mankind may be.<br /><br />As director Zack Snyder's first film with actual characters in it, "Watchmen" takes its time in building a back-story for its broad range of colorful characters and misfits, and is all the better for it. The narrative bounces back and forth between the past and the present (which, as it turns out, is a fictional 1985) and yet, through the 162 minutes the film takes to reach its point, it never lets up for one minute or becomes a chore to watch. Truly, this is one film where you won't want to miss a minute, with each scene carrying as much weight and relevancy as the next. While the material at hand is very dark and mature, and even though it won't appeal to a younger or more mainstream audience, it is certainly a film that functions on multiple levels.<br /><br />The film is chockfull of excellent performances from its cast, but it is Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach who stands out from the pack. This brilliant casting choice creates an iconic character that, many years down the line, the film will be remembered primarily for. As for direction, Snyder flexes his cinematic muscle with enough caffeinated action and jarring visual effects to match wits with the dense plot at hand, in turn, making this his finest film to date. Sure, there is a plethora of directors who could have tried their hand at this material, some perhaps more qualified, but Snyder's film is both classy and stylish and, in a nutshell, as close to perfection as it gets. It's an assault on the senses as well as the psyche, and perhaps one of the darkest superhero tales of our time, translated flawlessly to film.<br /><br /> "Watchmen" might not be enough to pacify one of its creators, but the purists and movie-lovers alike will find it a rare treat in film-making where a film based on a graphic novel or comic book can capture its source material so beautifully while simultaneously stimulating and satisfying those who are not already initiated. "Watchmen" is one of those films that, as we look back on this decade in the future, will be talked about and remembered fondly as a definitive film for its era. This is not just one of the finest films of the year, but also one of the best of its kind.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>When I first saw the trailer for Watchmen, I was whiped into a tizzy and immediatly had to rush out and get the graphic novel, instantly hooking myself into the world of the Watchmen and become a hardcore fan. When it finally came out that March day, I saw it twice and each time was completley blown away. Becoming one of those rare movies to be faithfully adapted and still retail some of its hardcore punch, Watchmen is in my opinion one of the best films of the year, perhaps even one of the best comic book movies ever made.<br /><br />Set in an alternate universe from our own, superhereos are pretty common place until a law is passed banning them from doing any more super work. When one of these supers, The Comedian, is murdered, it sets into motion a series of events that will have the world hanging on the crises and forcing these retired heroes back into action.<br /><br />Once again, Zack Snyder employs a similiar method he used for 300, with the whole greenscreen effect and once again it works beautifully. Each scene just jumps right at you, you are submersed into this grainy underworld that occasionally pops with brillinatly flashes of color (most obviously the yellow) and the effects are pretty damn amazing. Visually, it achieves on all fronts.<br /><br />And I have to point out the choice of music was absolutly spot on. I cannot listen to Bob Dylan's "The Times They Are a-Changin" without imagining the opening credits, which by the one are one of the many highlights of the film.<br /><br />What seperates Watchmen from other superhero/comic movies is the amazing psychological depths of the characters, profiles that you rarely ever see in these type of films (the other obvious example being the Batman series). With the likes of the Comedian, a typically vile character who you want to feel no sympathy for or Nite Owl, who is very spineless and docile, these characters could have easily been one dimensional and stagnat, but there were so many other layers to them, not just these outside conceptions but deeper, more thoughtful ideas that show more to each of the characters. And this kind of thing is certaintly not lost in the transition from book to screen, with each one holding just as much of their psychological profile and character traits that give the movie so much more then just an action/comic forray.<br /><br />With that in mind, every actor is great in the film, with defintinly the one standing out being Jackie Earl Haley as the violent Rorscache. Already my favorite from the comic, Haley goes above and beyond bringing him to life, adding so much more to the character then was seen in the comic, which is really saying something. He to me has become the new Joker of the year.<br /><br />I was a bit shocked at the sort of lukewarm reception the film got, but then again it wasn't like I didn't expect it. Watchmen the comic is going to be universally great because of its impact but the film is definintly going to split people, its just another one of those love it or hate it films, with me falling on the love it side. But truly, this is one of the must see films this year and once you view it, then you can make up your mind on it. Hopefully, you'll be like me and find it one of the most rewarding and satisfying films this year.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A69DJ2KPU4CH.html">A1A69DJ2KPU4CH</a><br/><p>So I just picked up the Ultimate Edition at Fry's for $14.95 yesterday. The price was too good to pass up, but it is not the Blu Ray edition, as they were all sold out. Still, this Ultimate Cut was over half the price I paid when it first came out, so I thought it was a good deal. Heck, as of this writing you can't even get it from a third party seller for the price I paid. I guess Fry's just wants to get rid of the remaining stock and are selling these at cost just to move them. There were two more copies left after I bought mine. Considering it's run its course, and is no longer being made, I view it as sort of a collectors item. I didn't buy it when it came out because I thought it was too expensive, and I had already purchased the DC edition, and that was in addition to the theatrical version I had purchased earlier. I was not about to be the studio's next sucker by purchasing another edition. I really hate the way the studio's milk popular movies by releasing so many editions of a movie, with often the most desirable coming out last. Since I don't see movies in theaters any more, and I really wanted to see Watchmen when it came out, so I jumped at the theatrical version as soon as it hit DVD knowing full well there were going to be better versions coming out later. I had waited long enough. Thankfully the DC had enough new content that it warranted the purchase, but the Ultimate Edition not so much. At least not the movie.<br /><br />Speaking of the movie, this Ultimate Edition version is the DC with an animated graphic novel interspersed throughout the movie. While I thought the Black Freighter was cool, as the title of my review suggests, it brought nothing worthwhile to the DC of the movie. I guess in some way it was supposed to parallel the struggles Rorschach deals with throughout the movie, but honestly, you are no worse for the wear without it. Which in my opinion means the DC is really the ultimate edition of the movie. The Black Freighter as a completely separate movie would be cool, especially because it could be more fleshed out than what we get in Watchmen. All the Black Freighter did was to make a long movie (DC version) even longer with no real payoff for your time. Again, I paid very little for this edition, so it's no big deal to me, but I am also keeping my DC version and will watch that when I'm in the mood for a Watchmen re-watch.<br /><br />However, it's not just the inclusion of the Ultimate Cut movie you get, but so much extra that the package becomes even more desirable. I will admit I haven't even gotten around to all of the extra content, and there is a lot of it! 360 minutes of extra content on disc two, and 325 minutes of extra content on discs three and four. Those last two discs I'm especially interested in, as they are the Watchmen comics brought to life, all 12 issues. As we all know, Watchmen is simply one of the most important, well written, well animated graphic novel's ever, so seeing them brought to life with motion (albeit limited motion from the box description) and voice work is going to be cool indeed. That alone would be worthy of the purchase, but I also look forward to disc two, which contains lots of cool content as well.<br /><br />Disc five is a bummer, for me at least. The digital copy expired as of November 10th, 2010 so I'm SOL with that one. Might also be the reason Fry's is selling the Ultimate Cut so cheap, as really, the digital copy is worthless. Truthfully, it's doubtful I would have copied it to my computer anyway, for one I'm nervous about DRM content infecting my computer, and why would I want to watch the movie on a 17" monitor when I have my 32" LED-LCD HDTV no more than 10 feet from me in my living room? Answer, I wouldn't. The digital copy is already in the trash, it's worthless and so I threw it out.<br /><br />All in all, this Ultimate Cut edition is great for the extra content, but not for the movie, for that the DC is more than sufficient. If I had spent $35 on the Ultimate Cut, which is what it cost when it first came out, not sure I would have been happy about that, but $15, I'm okay with it. If you are not a die hard Watchmen fan and you already own the DC, I would say you can safely skip this Ultimate Cut, but for the die hard Watchmen fans I feel there is enough extra content to warrant the purchase, but not at the prices third party sellers are asking, that's for sure. If you really want this edition take a trip to Fry's ASAP, if you have a store where you live, I'm sure they are priced the same at all of them.</p></br><a href="../users/AB0W9GTNGHSI3.html">AB0W9GTNGHSI3</a><br/><p>this movie fooled me, the effects were amazing the story was so boring, the trailer completely was a lie to the story, the acting was good hopefully next time it will be action packed like its preview.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>"Watchmen" was, for many years, the project considered impossible to film.  This movie proves that "Watchmen" was, indeed, possible to film, but that doing so may have been a bad idea.<br /><br />The major problem with this movie is not its length.  It's way, way too long - but that's a symptom of the problem, which is lack of focus.  Act 1 takes a long time to develop, and when it's over an hour or so into the movie, there's an unsettling feeling you get as the audience that comes from the fact that you don't know what the plot is even after 60 minutes.  Then, when the movie finally gets some focus, it's on - Nite Owl and Silk Spectre?  Huh?  The least interesting characters?  Rorschach is a jerk, but has a kind of purity as a character that makes him interesting.  Veidt, who is almost an afterthought in this movie, has a kind of purity about his character as well, but in a different way; he has chosen to follow ideals that may vary from Rorschach's, or that may be the same but implemented differently.  The ultimate confrontation in "Watchmen" is really between Veidt and Rorschach, so it's a shame Veidt is given such short shrift in most of the movie.  Veidt, rather than a central protagonist (antagonist?), is the Oliver Twist of the movie, the cipher whose motives and character just happen to be there because they're in the script.  Instead of developing Veidt, we get some unconvincing romance between Nite Owl and Silk Spectre, some overly long scenes on Mars, and a variety of other bits not important to the plot.  Not great from a storytelling perspective.<br /><br />Several shots and musical choices in this long, long movie were so hamhanded as to stand out from the remainder in an unfavorable way.  Why a minute-long crane shot prior to the Comedian's funeral?  That thing must have taken an entire day to shoot on its own, for no good end.  "99 Luftballons" as Silk Spectre meets Nite Owl for dinner?  At high volume?  For a long time?  There are many points in Watchmen where I wished the director would just get on with it.  Deliberate pacing is one thing, and can be very effective.  But there's a difference between deliberate pacing, and lingering over nothing.<br /><br />And speaking of hamhandedness, I agree with the main review that "Watchmen" seems like a transcription of the graphic novel at times.  Nowhere is that more obvious than the Rorschach origin scene.  A single frame of something horrific on the printed page has tremendous visceral impact.  Playing that out in an actual segment of movie is too much, and is over the top.  In addition, the 70s style depiction of New York as a cesspool of horrors each worse than the last is likely to be incomprehensible to younger viewers who did not live through the era of the bankruptcy of NYC.  The similar depiction of the constant threat of nuclear annihilation brought back some memories, but will be equally unfamiliar to younger viewers.  These underlying moods of the film lead to some jarring tonal shifts, and render "Watchmen" ultimately a serious downer.<br /><br />Geeks of a certain age, like myself, were going to watch this no matter what.  I can't recommend doing so, but if you're like me, you're going to do it anyway.  Save a few bucks and just rent this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>This is something of a review for the non-initiates. Meaning those that aren't slavish "Graphic Novel" fanboys. Not familiar with the classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0930289234">Watchmen</a> comic book? Then some of the plot points are not going to make much sense. But as a quick summary, it's an alternate history about the 80's Cold War (summed up nicely in the opening credits). Nixon used a super-powered being to end the Vietnam War and overturn the rules about term limits. But now the world teeters on the brink of a US/USSR Nuclear Exchange, and masked vigilantes that used to fight crime have been banned. And now, one of these "Watchmen" is suddenly, inexplicably murdered.<br /><br />So now the Watchmen must risk breaking the law and exposing themselves to danger. Someone is trying to pick-off ex-heroes. Why...and is this connected to the buildup of international aggression? Can they stop the doomsday clock from the midnight of Nuclear Annihilation? The story is complex and often defies logic; no less a director than Terry Gilliam let the project slip from his hands as he described it as "unfilmable." Yet Zach Snyder (he of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QXDED6">300</a> fame) working from a script by David Hayter have fashioned a near three hour film that dazzles the eye but lurches and jerks to its finale.<br /><br />Snyder was a good pic for a few reasons; "300" was a visually stunning actioner that made up in scenery and motion what it lacked in coherence. However, 300 was a movie about heroes, "Watchmen" is one about anti-heroes. NiteOwl2 is more a Clark Kent than a superman, and Comedian is a nihlistic killer of women and children. SilkSpectre2 is the product of a rape. Rorschach is a paranoid sociopath who lost his conscience (and as played by Jackie Earle Haley, one of the things making "Watchmen" worth watching). Dr Manhattan (Billy Cruddup in motion capture gear), the one being among the Watchmen with any real superpower has power at the expense of his emotional clarity. There were a couple other fun casting decisions, like Matt Frewer (Max Headroom!) as Moloch.<br /><br />All these things are direct from the adaptation of the script, and it is hard to call this an adaptation, it barely defers from the book only once in any major way and that is near the end. There's too much going on here plus a boatload of dead-weight. Rorschach's voice overs get to be overbearing; he's a character better suited to the juicy toss-off lines like his scene stealing "I'm not locked up with you, you're all locked up in here with ME!" The violence is usually gratuitous and the sex oft-times seems inserted just to prove "Watchmen's" 'edginess' when editorial coherence would have been better. And for God's sake ENOUGH SLO-MO SCENES. What was innovative in 1999 with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J0AQ">The Matrix</a> is now a lazy film-maker's cliche. It made a confounding movie to follow scream out about how clever it was without doing anything in service to the characters.<br /><br />Not the screaming failure of last summer's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CD6FKI">Speed Racer</a> or the transcendent success of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYELVA">X-Men</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GZ6QC4">The Dark Knight</a>, "Watchmen" will be of passing interest to DC fans and the basement geeks that have been waiting 20 years for this particular movie to arrive. Casual viewers will likely leave the theater wondering what all the fuss was about.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Thanks to a string of successful comic book movie hits, directors are finally showing some respect for their original source material.  In the past, it was clear that the director's vision eclipsed any fan interest, which resulted in the Batman series kicked off by Tim Burton eventually circling the toilet bowl before being flushed by Joel Schumacher.  The tide has reversed, with fanboys-turned-directors like Peter Jackson, Robert Rodriguez, and Guillermo del Toro showing an almost slavish devotion to the source material. Zack Snyder can now add his name to that list.<br /><br />Watchmen takes place in an alternate reality where the threat of weapons of mass destruction looms large, thanks in part to superheroes who range in sanction from government agents to violent outlaws. They are gods among men, these superheroes, but they are also deeply flawed human beings.  Watchmen is their story.<br /><br />There's remarkably little superhero-action in Watchmen.  When you strip away all the distractions like the altered timeline and the murder mystery, it becomes clear that Watchmen is actually a character study.  The film ping-pongs between each character's backstory, slowly peeling back each layer until we get to the conclusion: that people do terrible things for good reasons. Unfortunately, some characters are fleshed out more than others.<br /><br />Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), the Question-like stand-in, is the most interesting character, an anti-hero filled with the rage of moral absolutism, right at home in a repressive society. He also provides noir-style narrative throughout Watchmen.<br /><br />Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), who has an uncanny resemblance to a young Chevy Chase, is basically an alternative Batman in search of a cause.  He's largely a cipher here, cast primarily as the potential love interest of Silk Spectre.<br /><br />Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) provides the emotional center of the film but unfortunately doesn't do much for women's rights - she comes off as emotionally conflicted and petulant.<br /><br />The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a Punisher analogue whose death at the beginning of the film provides much of the movie's structure, is also a relative unknown.  His nickname is derived from his sociopathic detachment, killing with glee.  Unfortunately, he just comes off as a murderous thug.<br /><br />Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) is perfect as a mildly contemptuous superhuman, more alien and powerful than Superman. His mere existence can cause nations to go to war.  Unfortunately, the film struggles with defining the limits of his powers - I half expected Manhattan to change time and space (like Superman did in the 1978 film) to "fix" things.<br /><br />Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), perhaps the most important character in the film, is inexplicably both the most brilliant man on earth and a supreme martial artist. There's nothing in Ozymandias' background to explain why this is.  His complete lack of development compared to the other characters is where Watchmen stumbles.<br /><br />Watchmen is a really interesting take on superheroes.  Unfortunately, it is no longer revolutionary as it might have been, because the 80s comic laid the framework for serious superhero comics that came later, which in turn spawned serious superhero movies like The Dark Knight.  In other words, Watchmen might have been a genre-shaking film ten years ago.  It's less successful as an entertaining film today. It's a museum replica of comic book history, faithful to its medium and appreciated more as a reference than a movie experience.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>In an alternate 1986, the US and Soviet Union are sliding towards war.  The Comedian (Morgan), a member of a disbanded group of superheroes called the Watchmen, is brutally murdered; setting events in motion that will change the world.  Rorschach (Haley), another member of the Watchmen, who happens to be a little unstable, sets out to find the killer.  He seeks the assistance of the rest of the team, Dr. Manhattan (Crudup), Silk Spectre (Ackerman), Ozymandias (Goode), and Night Owl (Wilson), to find the killer and is met with mixed reactions.  Still, he pushes onward, discovering a plan beyond his imagination .<br /><br />"Watchmen" is based on the vastly popular graphic novel by Dave Gibbons and an uncredited Alan Moore.  I have not read the source material, but have heard that the movie is very faithful to the comic with the exception of the ending.  The story is dense and complex and is not always easy to follow.  I don't think that is intentional, and that works against the film.  For the most part, the characters do not stand out.  The exception is Rorschach, amazingly played by Jackie Earle Haley.  He chews the scenery and simply steals every single scene he is in.  I would have loved to see more of him, but this is an ensemble film, so he is only one of many.  The film looks great.  Director Zach Snyder has a clear grasp of how to make a good looking movie.  In the end, fans of the book will be mostly pleased I think, but those unfamiliar with the work might be a bit put off.  This isn't a film for everyone, and I can only give it a marginally positive review.</p></br><a href="../users/A8G9GETA2OLMZ.html">A8G9GETA2OLMZ</a><br/><p>To give credit where due: this movie goes beyond the simplistic formulas of the usual superhero movies, and attempts to deal with SOCIAL issues, rather than just individual ones.  For example, clearly avoiding nuclear holocaust is preferable to merely cleaning up streetgangs who happened to hurt a friend.<br /><br />And it tries to get beyond the rigid dualism of GOOD vs. EVIL, by intimating that most of the times things are not so clear.  For example, Veidt is a liar and a murderer, but does it in a greater cause--which really is a greater cause, and not merely self-serving.<br /><br />Also, it presents a lot of characters, and they go through changes--all of which adds interest.  Oddly, Rorschach is the most interesting, and the best actor.<br /><br />However, the take on social issues, while laudable in principle, is lame in practice.  The movie is still hobbled by its "the political is always personal" outlook.  For example, when Veidt and Rorschach finally face off, no resolution is possible except for one of them to blow the other up.<br /><br />As in all superhero movies, the special effects are more important than the people.  You don't really know if Billy Crudup is affectless because the character demands it, or if he just can't act.<br /><br />All in all, this picture is unsettling and not very instructive or fun.<br /><br />I'm glad I saw it.  And I will never watch it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>7/10 Stars<br /><br />Upon reading Alan Moore's Watchmen I was blown away by its complexity and attention to various small details that could be present in a society where caped crusaders were a part of everyday life, and the loved the philosophy presented within the panels, but now I am forced into the difficult task of judging this movie adaptation of the infamous graphic novel.  Upon seeing this movie I wrote an initial review of my opinion, but realized there was something wrong with it.  The problem was that I was spending more time praising Moore's novel than the actual movie, so I deleted it and decided to start from scratch after spending a good deal of time reflecting on the movie and flipping through the panels of the comic.<br /><br />Now I am torn between liking and disliking this film adaptation of the beloved graphic novel.<br /><br />On one hand I love Moore's original story and comic.  On the other hand I am not very fond of director Zack Snyder's previous films (the remake of Dawn of the Dead and 300).<br /><br />On one hand this movie mimics the visual style of the novel very well and looks very well polished.  On the other hand Snyder and his team in their dedication to perfectly mimicking the story of the graphic novel have made this final product come across as very mechanical and unmoving.<br /><br />For the most part the actors pull of their parts, but none of them really go above and beyond to truly make the characters anything more than iconic images lovingly ripped from the panels of Moore's story.  There were only two actors who I felt really tried to do something with their characters in an attempt to enhance the characters, and they were Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian.  Aside from these two performances I feel that most of the actors were so determined to fit Snyder's idea of matching the book perfectly that they failed to take the initiative to really try and break the wall and make this movie more than the graphic novel put into motion.  But, not to leave him out of this review Billy Crudup did do a satisfactory performance behind the make-up and special effects for his portrayal of Doctor Manhattan, but it wasn't good enough to really get my attention when compared to Earle Haley and Dean Morgan.<br /><br />We also get decent performances by a few minor, supporting cast members, such as Robert Wisden as Richard Nixon.  He wasn't no Frank Langella and his make-up was rather off part of Snyder once again trying to carbon copy the graphic novel), but it was by no means a bad Nixon performance.  A good supporting act is also given by Carla Gugino as the first Silk Spectre.<br /><br />Even with the few acting problems the production is a good and it is strong.  The images are dazzling, and very true to the comic.  It is definitely one of best providers of eye candy we're likely to see 2009, but then we have to remember visuals aren't everything, and that's why I was let down by this film.<br /><br />My biggest problem, as I have previously mentioned, is the lack of initiative that the production crew took when making this film.  It's like they took up a diet of respectively redoing the comic for twelve weeks until they remembered each panel perfectly and made the actors do the same.  Most of the actors don't look like they're really into their roles, and the production is just a fanboy dream come true, but it manages to do one thing that made me mad that keeps me from rating this higher than a seven.<br /><br />If this had just been a visual comic down to the letter I would probably give it an 8/10, but the few times Snyder decides to take action and add in his own little ideas to the plot it just really distracted me from the concept of the story, and ruined the mood for me.  What is it that Snyder is adding that angers me so much?  Perhaps the most pointless gore and drawn out sex scenes I have ever seen on the big screen.<br /><br />The gore is tacky, and cheap, and distracts from the story, and philosophy behind the images.  Many of these images were not in the graphic novel, and nor were they ever even HINTED in the graphic novel.  In this movie we have arms broken wide open, a man has his arms cut off, and a man repeatedly has his head cut into by a meat cleaver.  None of these moments ever took place in the graphic novel, and I felt they threw off the pace, and distracted the viewers from what was actually going on, and I won't even talk about how he drew out a sex scene that was like six-panels into a 5-10 minute scene.<br /><br />My favorite part was by far the opening credits, and I don't say that in a bad way because it was really a brilliant way to open the movie.  To the tune of `The Times They Are A Changin' we get an animated series of photos that maps out most of the Watchmen's history, the universe they live in, and the setting for the rest of the film.  This moment alone makes this movie a must-see for fans of the comics.<br /><br />I can't recommend this film very positively because I for one was disappointed by the finished product.  I'm sure many will rave about this film, and it's sure to become a cult-classic, but compared to the graphic novel it really is nothing.  Watchmen may be the most endearing comic of all time, and is a classic for the medium, but as a film its impact will not be as lasting as films such as last year's The Dark Knight.  The comic will always be remembered as a great, and an incredibly unique, original tale, but I fear this film adaptation will slip away into strictly cult-movie realm over the next twenty years.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>For the most part, Watchmen is a decent movie. Up until the end of the movie, I was loving every minute of it. The film was staying 98% true to the graphic novel and then it all fell apart within the last hour. Things are cut, changed and the lack of urgency about saving the world is missing. In the novel, there is a real urgency about Dr. Manhattan and his need to return to save the planet, but the emotion of it is lost in the film. The main reason being things being cut, crucial parts being left out, and other plot points being changed (as mentioned before). I had to explain what was happening on screen to help fill the gaps to the others I was watching it with who haven't read the book. That's bad when there are pieces missing I have to fill for the film to make sense.<br /><br />Between the two (book and movie), the book is better. I'd recommend this movie probably more to those who haven't read the novel. That being said, I still liked it overall for the most part. It's not a waste of time, but what could have been a great movie ended up being just good to okay.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>In a gritty and alternate 1985 the glory days of costumed vigilantes have been brought to a close by a government crackdown, but after one of the masked veterans is brutally murdered an investigation into the killer is initiated. The reunited heroes set out to prevent their own destruction, but in doing so discover a deeper and far more diabolical plot. The superpowers of the graphic novel are weakened, but Watchmen still packs a wallop. This movie brings the superhero-noir murder mystery very much to life.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>The biggest challenge for directors and screenplay writers --  who are forced to deal with significant source material -- is to make a movie that'll appeal to a broad audience while not alienating those fans who love what the film's based on; in this case, The Watchmen graphic novels/comics created by Alan Moore. Released via DC Comics in 1986 and 1987, the twelve book limited series quickly developed a cult following thanks to the truly graphic nature in which superheroes were depicted. Artist Dave Gibson and colorist John Higgins gave readers gritty images that swerved far beyond the comfort zone of most graphic novel fans, giving us heroes with flaws so grand it would make Penthouse and Pl@yboy Magazine editors blush.<br /><br />The film rights for WATCHMEN were snapped up in 1986 and several production companies, directors, screenplay artists and others attempted adaptations that were promptly shelved. Directors such as Terry Gilliam (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KB4898">Tideland</a>), David Hayter (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYELVA">X-Men</a>) and Darren Aronofsky (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TOD9VI">The Wrestler</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O7667K">The Fountain</a>) were at different times slated to take on the film, but eventually backed out. Aronofsky I think was an interesting choice, specifically because I so enjoyed his visual take on The Fountain. But Gilliam deserves quite a bit of credit for saying something that rings truer than most. He said, "I'd direct the Watchmen if it could be made into a five hour miniseries." Hmm. Considering the extensive source material, that probably wouldn't be a bad idea. And considering the length of this suck@r (163 minutes with an extended version that adds another twenty), one can't help but wonder what Gilliam would've done with it. But, instead, we got Zach Snyder (300) and a theatrical release this year (2009).<br /><br />Not taking anything away from Snyder, he did pretty well with what he got, which was an overstuffed script filled with some sketchy dialogue. But he also had some great visuals and an amazing musical score that really rocked the film on many different levels. The music came from so many sources that it boggles my mind. Nat King Cole. Bob Dylan. Simon & Garfunkel. Jimi Hendrix. And even KC and the Sunshine Band. All of the songs were well incorporated into the story and gave an added flavor to the scenes.<br /><br />One also MUST take note of the film's well-deserved R rating. The F-word is liberally sprinkled throughout, as is the act itself. One particularly steamy scene inside an aircraft reveals every inch of two prime characters, and I do mean EVERY INCH. Violence is rampant, just as it should've been, but parents might think -- this being a based on a "comic book" -- that it is relatively harmless, Spiderman-like action. Not so. Dismemberment. Superheroes shooting -- and killing -- pregnant women. Rape. All of these are predominantly in the film's forefront, showing us the deconstruction of the superhero mythos envisioned by the graphic novels' original artist, Alan Moore.<br /><br />While the films visual qualities, sound, and music are something for fans to cheer about, the terrible dialogue, rearend-numbing length, and confusing narration sequences pull the movie down quite a few notches. Initially seeming to be Rorschach's responsibility to narrate what's come before and after (Rorschach is a cop with a face only a psychologist could love and played very well by Jackie Earle Haley, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N3SU92">Little Children</a>), the narration then jumps to Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MXPE7O">The Good Shepherd</a>) -- whom I've affectionately renamed Mr. Peni$ -- and back, and then back again to Rorschach. Since we're basically viewing the film via Rorschach's journal, I think sticking with him would've been the best and least confusing way to go.<br /><br />An example of the film's bad dialogue are just too easy to find: "I know who my father was," and "It doesn't take a genius to see the world has problems," and the lowly "Never compromise. Not even in the face of Armageddon."<br /><br />Even with these significant flaws, it's worth praising Zach Snyder for having the teste$ to move forward and make this film. That, in itself, is nothing short of miraculous. But it doesn't negate the obstacles that could've made this a truly great film. Perhaps a trilogy would've been better?</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>My two cents:<br />A big 4-4.5 star treat for the fans of the book and a confusing, fairly bizarre, yet visually striking (not thinking of the blue ---- but that too) original film for everyone else.<br /><br />The overall look of this comic book movie is fantastic. There are brilliant moments that linger in your mind well after leaving the theater. The casting seems fine. I've not heard whatever complaints there were from the fanboys, if any. The screenplay is flawed. Though, I have no idea how it could have been better and still remained as dedicated to the source material. Couldn't things have moved along at a better pace (for non-fans too)? Well, for my part, well over an hour-maybe hour and a half- into this and it still felt like things were just starting. As for the plot, it's absurd. There are maybe one or two maybe three "good guys" but they can't make a difference, can they? And they all have problems. If you think something good or at least necessary was done at the end, you are morally lost my friend. I'm glad in our universe we don't have and do not need superheroes, especially ones like these. I hope.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M1NNDD95HR0R.html">A3M1NNDD95HR0R</a><br/><p>I went into this movie hungry for another superhero movie.  It was one of those movies that I just had to see.  I did not read Watchmen the graphic novel, so I really didn't know what I was in for.  But that's part of the fun sometimes.  Unfortunately I cannot say this movie was a pleasant surprise.  The trailer showed me it had potential, which is really all I had to go on.  Call me crazy, but I prefer the traditional superhero movie without the gore and the sex and the bright blue penis.  But on the plus side, the special effects were nice, the fight choreography was pretty good, and some parts were really neat, like Dr. Manhattan on Mars.  He was a cool character.  I especially liked how he could dismantle and suspend things in midair, make clones of himself, teleport, and grow to a ginormous size.  Nevertheless, this is not a movie for children.  Get them a babysitter if you want to see this film.  Should you see this film in the theater, or buy it on DVD?  Tough call.  If you liked the darkness of the last 2 Batman films (with Christian Bale), you are in the ballpark of the dark vibe of Watchmen, but Watchmen has more sex and gore.  Maybe read a few reviews before you decide, unlike me, who just saw the trailer before seeing it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGVB3T5QJNRE.html">A3DGVB3T5QJNRE</a><br/><p>This story was written back in the 1980's when the Cold War was still unfolding. Those who are too young to remember the fear of nuclear war and that the Commies would someday be knocking on our doors -are lucky! It's sad to say, but ALL wars from the Korean to Vietnam, and every other war Americans funded throughout the world - in mostly poor, Third World nations - were all caused by the never ending Cold War! Keep in mind these numerous wars cost millions of lives and many billions of dollars! Watchmen, while a fantasy, is certainly realistic when it comes to the fear many people around the world felt. (And, this is an era, which should be carefully studied by every student in the United States before graduating high school, but I digress....)<br /><br />In Watchmen there are very few good guys! The violence is so gruesome at times I had to repeatedly cover my eyes! And I'm in my 40's! I WANT TO WARN PARENTS THIS FILM IS NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG TEENS! If the gruesome scenes of violence don't disturb them, they need to get some help! While the Watchmen is a fantasy/science fiction/drama/chick flick -it's also a horror film! This is NOT some cutesy Super Hero story!<br /><br />Watchmen is an important film, which will soon be forgotten because of the extreme violence and, at the same time, for it's deep political message. This is also an anti-Republican and anti-conservative film -as blatantly political as you can get! This is the part of the story I love! While Richard Nixon and the toady Henry Kissinger were no dummies by any stretch of the imagination, they both were accurately portrayed as morally bankrupt and plain crazy! But the bottom line here is that the majority of voting Americans vote these monsters into office and then collectively shrug their shoulders when rotten things happen! To say that the Watchmen is a sobering story about the sheer stupidity of the human race in general - and the American people, specifically,  is an understatement!<br /><br />See: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/027599435X">Who Benefits from Global Violence and War: Uncovering a Destructive System (Contemporary Psychology)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1859846319">The Trial of Henry Kissinger</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0813341124">The Skull Beneath The Skin: Africa After The Cold War</a><br /><br />For a MUCH more entertaining approach to Science Fiction/Fantasy see:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059HAE">Zardoz</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059HAC">Enemy Mine</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TZN7KQ">Fantastic Planet</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXXP">A.I. - Artificial Intelligence (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/630587493X">Bicentennial Man</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001S86J0I">Galaxy Quest (Deluxe Edition)</a></p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>The graphic novel WATCHMEN is perhaps the greatest graphic novel ever written.  I'm not one to linger on that title too much, since I've never been a big comic book guy; I will say that WATCHMEN is certainly a great work of literature.  It features some insightful and disturbing suggestions, set against a fantastic premise: what if individuals, inspired by comic books, began dressing up in costumes and fighting crime?  And what would happen when these masked heroes came across a genuine superhero?<br /><br />Zack Snyder's film is an almost-too-faithful adaptation of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon's source novel.  WATCHMEN doesn't feel like its own film; it feels more like a tribute to the graphic novel.  Nor, for that matter, does the movie quite congeal: it's more a hodgepodge of related scenes thrown together.  Granted, everything is visually stunning, and the action keeps the film flowing fairly smoothly.  However, the theoretical concepts aren't quite meant for the silver screen.  Hollywood has rarely been able to achieve the complexity of the written (or illustrated) word, and the relative flatness of WATCHMEN's (the film) ending is bitter proof of that.  When I saw it in the cinema, people actually laughed.<br /><br />You will have to decide for yourself if Snyder deserves praise or condemnation for keeping the film so faithful.  Overall, WATCHMEN is an enjoyable film experience that is worth repeating.  The acting is fairly solid, especially from Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan, and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach, the film's driving character.  Dialogue and scenes are mostly taken word-for-word from the graphic novel (whether they should be or not is debatable).  The end result is a film worth seeing, but when compared to the source material pales almost into non-existence.  Nor can you really judge the film on its own merits, since it goes so far out of its way to stay true to the novel.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>One of the darker and most apocalyptic comic book adaptations yet to make it to screen, Watchmen is a super-powered epic in a dystopian world where the lines between right and wrong have been blurred and danger and doom seem to be closing in on all fronts.  It's famous for its darkness and its view of a cynical world, but I think it's going too far to call Watchmen a nihilistic movie.  For every look at the broken society it tales place in, every moment of human depravity, and every shade of despair, there's also an unexpectedly bright glimmer of hope, a chance at redemption, or a moment of tender beauty.  And of course, it all takes place in an action-pached, visually awesome panorama.<br /><br />  Taking place in an alternate version of 1985 America where superheroes and supervillains have existed since the late 30s and have changed the course of world history (including a quick ending to the Vietnam War that saw Vietnam become the 51st state), Watchmen opens in a dark, cynical world where a nuclear showdown between the U.S. and the Soviet Union seems imminent.  Superheroes - except for those acting under the auspices of the U.S. government - have been banned for several years now, although some rogue crimefighters still continue on in the shadows, such as the masked, highly violent vigilante Rorschach (played by Jackie Earl Haley).  We see through flashbacks how the relationship of superheroes, the general public, and the government had changed over the decades: originally greeted with great enthusiasm, beating back a crime wave in the 30s and 40s and helping to win World War II; the backlash a few years later including the hate crime murder of the openly lesbian superhero Silhouette and her lover, as well as the locking away of various costumed crimefighters into mental hospitals; the superhero rennaissance in the 1950s with the appearance of the first truly superpowered hero, the godlike Dr. Manhattan (played by Billy Crudup); the formation of the Watchmen with sincere hopes of saving the world; and the twilight of the superhero age with conflicting agendas between the heroes and the government, rifts within the superhero community opening up due in part to the increasingly open hyper-violence of characters like the 'superhero' The Comedian, public panic, and finally the banning of costumed crimefighters.  (And this is just the backstory to the main tale!) Which brings us into the movie's present, where Dr. Manhattan is one of the only 'legal' superhumans (who would be difficult to ban even if he weren't working alongside the government - his power surpasses that of the combined might of all the world's conventional and nuclear armies) - and the mentally unbalanced Rorschach leads a brutal one-man war against crime, while possessed of a seering hatred of the very world he's supposedly protecting.  And most of the former costumed heroes have simply slipped back into the fabric of society and are leading relatively 'normal' lives, their secret identities still mostly unknown.<br /><br />  Yes, it's difficult in the beginning to tell who the good guys are and who the bad guys are, and to some extent even after the movie's conclusion it's up to the viewer to decide who falls under which heading.  It's made somewhat clearer as the flashbacks bring in the long-standing motivations of various characters, as well as their often tragic pasts.  In my mind, by movie's end, there actually are some characters who deserve to be filed as true heroes, there are definately some true villains, and there are a lot who straddle that blurry line.  The lack of the movie clearly identifying in its early chapters who you're 'supposed' to root for and against ends up as a plus rather than a minus and fits in with Watchmen's somewhat non-linear storytelling.<br /><br />  After Rorschach decides that the death of one of the supposedly retired members of the old Watchmen team was actually a murder, he gets it in his head that someone's coming after all past and present superheroes, and attempts to enlist other former Watchmen to form a resistance.  He also seems to feel that this ties in to some grand conspiracy that's going to usher in the end of the world.  Largely dismissed as paranoid by his former peers - and with understandable reason given his increasingly erratic and hostile behavior in recent years - later events begin to add credence to at least some of Rorschach's theories.  But can he put the remaining members of the Watchmen back together, and if so, will that save the world or somehow destroy it?  In the overall story that, with flashbacks, covers years, we see heroes unable to stop the chaos in the world from spinning out of control and nearly go insane from it; we see heroes fall from grace and try to crawl their way back up; we see villains recognize at last the horrors of their own atrocities and attempt to go straight - or do they?; and we see the most powerful being on the planet slowly start losing the ability to relate to humans or to perceive existance in the same way mortals do.  In many of its instances Watchmen is as it's been touted - heroes struggling in an uphill battle to make a difference, and not always succeeding.  In other cases though it's a case of the Villains doing exactly the same thing - trying to make a difference and not always succeeding.  Because in the minds of most (not all) of the movie's real bad guys, they Think that what they're doing is for the greater good.  And what's even more potent than having them just all be insane with really twisted views of the world, when you see their reasoning and their goals, it often makes a horrifying kind of sense.<br /><br />  There's more subtext to the movie than could be discussed here.  A few random observations - the musical score and the use of various songs fits in absolutely perfectly with the onscreen happenings; the sudden return of two supposedly retired Watchmen to save the trapped inhabitants of a burning skyscraper is one of the most dramatic and awesome movie moments I've ever seen; the physical battles are incredible; the constantly changing patterns on Rorscach's mask are freaky cool; and Malin Akerman as Silk Spectre II is possibly the sexiest super-heroine yet seen on screen.<br /><br />  Watchmen succeeds hugely on multiple levels.  It should be noted that though this is a superhero movie, this definately isn't something to get in for your seven year-old Spider-Man/Iron Man fan (those movies are great too, but in a different way).  A grand, disturbing and enthralling epic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>Watchmen, the graphic novel by Alan Moore upon which Watchmen, the film, was based has a huge cult following. From the DC Comics Vertigo line, it is a comic book for adults. Not just because of the graphic violence, and graphic, if not quite pornographic, sex, but also because of the philosophical, psychological, and the historical content. Allusions to Aristotle and Allen Ginsberg's Howl are mixed with cultural references to Lee Iacocca, JFK, and Richard Milhous Nixon. Laced with post-modern irony throughout, we have a comedian with a very perverse sense of humor; a sociopath vigilante whose face is an ever shifting Rorschach pattern; a physicist endowed with strange powers after a tragic accident and ominously named Dr. Manhattan; and another who takes his name from the famous sonnet Ozymandias by Percy Bysshe Shelley.<br /><br />-------------------<br />Adrian Veidt / Ozymandias: I don't mind being the smartest man in the world; I just wish it wasn't this one.<br />==========<br /><br />The climactic scenes of Watchmen take place in 1985, but it is a parallel universe to our reality with a few interesting twists: Masked and caped super heroes are a part of everyday life, and have been since before WWII. Nixon doesn't resign in disgrace after Watergate, but serves for three terms. Nixon uses Dr. Manhattan as a secret weapon to win the war in Viet Nam, and Viet Nam becomes the 51st state of the U.S. The U.S. is on the brink of nuclear war with Russia, and the tension is higher than it was at the height of The Cold War.<br /><br />--------------<br />Dan Dreiberg / Nite Owl II: What happened to us? What happened to the American Dream?<br />Edward Blake / Comedian: "What happened to the American Dream?" It came true! You're lookin' at it...<br />==========<br /><br />Though Alan Moore preemptively disowns all filmed adaptations of his work, I can't imagine a more faithful adaptation. I admit that I haven't read the graphic novel, but that will soon change. Meanwhile, you can see that a lot of the storyboard shots were taken from the comic's panels, and not only the story, but the original artwork was respected. I love the look of the film, a kind of gritty realism that wove the superheroes seamlessly into the tapestry of their times. The 40's era scenes were true to their period, and likewise, the scenes in the 80's also captured the 80's zeitgeist. I love Nite Owl II's Owl Craft, the way it looked as it cruised over the city, those big round windows like the owl's eyes. The only false note for me was Dr. Manhattan sometimes looked like an animation superimposed over live action--which I suppose he was. Still you could tell that they used some very sophisticated special effects, trying some new things that almost worked, but most worked spectacularly well. And Dr. Manhattan, put on some pants!<br /><br />-------------------<br />Laurie Juspeczyk / Silk Spectre II: The most powerful thing in the universe... still just a puppet.<br />Jon Osterman / Dr. Manhattan: We are all puppets, Laurie. I'm just the puppet who can see the strings.<br />==========<br /><br />I have to hand it to Director Zack Snyder and the cast. Especially Malin ?kerman as Laurie Jupiter / Silk Spectre II and Patrick Wilson as Dan Dreiberg / Nite Owl II. The scenes where they suit up in their superhero costumes and cruise the night in the Owl Craft, which was for them a kind of aphrodisiac, were excellent. It brought to mind a similar scene in The Losers, also highly recommended, where Jeffery Dean Morgan (who plays The Comedian in Watchmen) and Zo? Saldana also use fighting as foreplay. Patrick Wilson not only captures the heat, he also portrays Dan Dreiberg as a stodgy middle aged fuddy duddy when he is not in his Nite Owl II costume. Malin ?kerman is excellent both here and in scenes with Billy Crudup's Dr. Manhattan, who is growing increasingly distracted by the threat of a nuclear Armageddon, and more and more detached from any human connections. Laurie is a complicated woman, who also has major issues with her mother, Sally Jupiter / Silk Spectre, played by Carla Gugino. Don't even get me started on her Daddy issues.<br /><br />Still, when it comes to major issues, no one tops Jackie Earle Haley as Walter Kovacs / Rorschach. His name refers to the Rorschach inkblot test used in psychotherapy, and he wears a mask with an ever shifting Rorschach pattern on it. He doesn't call it a mask. He calls it his face. Rorschach channels his sociopathic urges into vigilante actions, like Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. Like Travis Bickle, he waits for that Someday. "Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets."<br /><br />-------------------<br />Walter Kovacs / Rorschach: The streets are extended gutters and the gutters are full of blood and when the drains finally scab over, all the vermin will drown. The accumulated filth of all their sex and murder will foam up about their waists and all the whores and politicians will look up and shout "Save us!"... and I'll whisper "no."<br />==========<br /><br />Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian and Matthew Goode as Ozymandias round out the band of Watchmen, and Alan Moore, though he has vowed never to watch the film, couldn't ask for a better portrayal of his characters. I was ready to write off Jeffrey Dean Morgan after first seeing him on Grey's Anatomy, especially when his character came back as a ghost, but thankfully I gave him a chance here. He was excellent as The Comedian, though he never told a single joke. Maybe that was the punch line. He is also a winner in The Losers.<br /><br />-------------------<br />Edward Blake / Comedian: Once you realize what a joke everything is, being the Comedian is the only thing that makes sense.<br />==========<br /><br />Director Zack Snyder made excellent choices in music, using several iconic songs that could almost be too powerful and distract or overwhelm the narrative were they not placed in exactly the right time and place. Three Dylan songs: Blowin' In The Wind done by Dylan, but All Along The Watchtower in the famous Jimi Hendrix version and Desolation Row done by My Chemical Romance. Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen has been used in countless films, but nowhere as appropriate as here. We also get 99 Luftballoons by Nena, The Sounds of Silence by Simon and Garfunkle, and Boogie Man by K.C. and the Sunshine Band! Get down tonight!<br /><br />-------------------<br />Walter Kovacs / Rorschach: Man bursts into tears. Says, "But doctor... I am Pagliacci." Good joke. Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum. Curtains.<br />==========<br /><br />The bottom line is Watchmen is a very watchable movie that combines comic book action with deeper, more adult themes. In a perfect world it would be watched by more people, but it appeals strongly to its cult audience, kids who have grown up on comic books, and who still enjoy reading comic books, but demand a more sophisticated, grown up story.<br /><br />-------------------<br />Jon Osterman / Dr. Manhattan: They claim their labors are to build a heaven, yet their heaven is populated by horrors. Perhaps the world is not made. Perhaps nothing is made. A clock without a craftsman. It's too late. Always has been, always will be. Too late.<br />==========<br /><br />Los Links:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCUO5M">Shutter Island</a> (2010) Jackie Earle Haley was George Noyce<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG99G8">The Losers</a> (2010) Jeffrey Dean Morgan was Clay<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QXDED6">300 (Widescreen Edition)</a> (2006) Directed by Zack Snyder<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FS9FCG">V for Vendetta (Widescreen Edition)</a> (2005) (based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EQHXNW">Match Point</a> (2005) Matthew Goode was Tom Hewett<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNTX">Sin City</a> (2005) Carla Gugino was Lucille<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006CXI1">Death to Smoochy (Widescreen Edition)</a> (2002) Danny Woodburn was Angelo Pike<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXWJ">Spy Kids</a> (2001) Carla Gugino was Ingrid Cortez<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXMG">Almost Famous</a> (2000) Billy Crudup was Russell Hammond<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001WTUE4">The Day of the Locust</a> (1975) Jackie Earle Haley was Adore<br /><br />-------------------<br />Aristotle: "Pios tha filatei tus filakes?"

I enjoy the movie, despite the fact that the over-the-top violence would normally put me entirely off, because I think there's a great deal of entertainment to be had in the world presented: a world that seems to be entirely populated by good guys, bad guys, and gun-toting hookers. Since the alternate reality they inhabit is so foreign to our own (right down to the black-and-white color schema!), the deep philosophical rumblings on the nature of life that are directed at the audience can be enjoyed either as the insane ramblings of strong men who have enjoyed one too many hits to the noggin, or as a realistic portrayal of a world alien to our own. But, and this is the key: you never get the feeling that you're supposed to take it *seriously*, simply because the world is so alien to our own that any direct comparison fails from the get-go.<br /><br />What is disturbing about "Watchmen" is that, even though the movie is clearly set in a reality alternate from our own, the movie seems to keep asking us to condone the actions and beliefs of the masked vigilantes on the screen. Like "Sin City", it is difficult to find a character here who isn't insane, a murderer, or offensively callous and self-indulgent (or all three), and yet unlike "Sin City", the movie seems not to be saying "Wow, look how messed up these guys are" and more, "Wow, don't these guys have a tough-yet-realistic view of humanity," and it's difficult for me to get on board with an author tract like that. Indeed, because these characters are framed within the "masked vigilante heroes" narrative, it's sometimes difficult to tell if the movie remembers that many of them *are* murderers who regularly (and illegally) take the law into their own hands.<br /><br />Even if you can get past the uncomfortable feeling that the movie is preaching at you, I just found it difficult to enjoy "Watchmen" on its own merits. Perhaps because it is in color, but the violence feels more real and more gratuitous than I'm usually comfortable with - close up shots of womens hands being blown off might be 'artsy', but not necessarily entertaining. The lack of a strong female presence was also off-putting - in a movie puportedly featuring "strong" super-women, it's very vexing to realize that the three women in the movie have defining roles as victim (our lesbian masked avenger and, for my money, the most interesting character in the movie, which is why it's a shame she gets killed in the bloody credits), victim (in a brutal near-rape scene which does little to establish Silk Spectre as a hero who can handle herself on the streets), and ing&eacute;nue (I'm not sure how else to define Silk Spectre Mark Two, whose defining role in the movie is largely a matter of "who is she sleeping with right now?"). It seems like a strange step backward from "Sin City" where the hookers and strippers were more tough-as-nails and paradoxically less defined by their sexuality than these supposedly empowered characters.<br /><br />Too much of the plot comes down to an authorial "because I say so". Why is Nixon willing to touch off nukes (despite the truly horrible 50-50 odds of surviving the conflict) the moment Dr. Manhattan disappears, rather than attempt "weak" diplomacy? Why does the final twist result in "peace" and nuclear non-proliferation when, if anything, everyone would be clamoring for MORE nukes to go after Mars in retaliation and for self-protection? The movie just asserts that these unlikely outcomes are so, but to just assert such unrealistic things completely undermines the narrative as having any kind of relationship to our reality, despite the repeated attempts to create a parallel.<br /><br />Bottom line, I could not enjoy this movie as over-the-top fun because of the repeated feeling that I was watching an author tract on the nature of humanity, but I could not enjoy it as a philosophical exercise because the events seemed to be so unrealistically asserted that I could see no relationship between this reality and my own. Having said *that*, I can see how a lot of people less squeamish than I might love this movie on its own merits, and it's easy to see that a lot of work and love went into this movie, so if you think you might like it despite the violence and alien nature of the alternate world, you might enjoy checking it out.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>The ground breaking graphic novel now makes its way to the big screen.  And it's clear only the big screen can cope with this project...  It's certainly a surprisingly bold and original mixture of adult themed drama and superhero milieu to come from a modern day risk-averse Hollywood - but does it work?<br />Creating a complex alternate timeline set in the mid 80's, where superheroes exist and Nixon is still in power having won Vietnam, we are presented with a world where the cold war is leading inexorably to doomsday and the American dream has soured.  The Minutemen, a group of vigilantes originally formed in the 40's, who donned costumes and kept superfit to deal with crime, have been disbanded as their methods are called into question.  Now one of their number, the Comedian, has been slain, and gradually the remaining Minutemen must start talking together and rediscover old alliances to save the world as it teeters on the edge of extermination.  Of course, that's only the barest bones of what is going on.  What actually IS going on and what it all means will doubtless be the topic of many fevered post movie discussions.. whether you love it or loathe it, you'll almost certainly be talking about it - and is that not what the best directors really want?<br />The movie is full of conflicted characters with authentically grimy backstories and motivations... in juxtaposition with the graphic novel stylisations and God-complexes.  For the most part the costumed heroes are only too human - not just noble heroic human, but flawed with an ugly side human.  Did Batman appeal for having a hero who had no superpower, and bruised and bled after fights..?  Well, maybe this will appeal.  On the other hand, the God complex issue comes to the fore with Dr. Manhatten - an ordinary man exposed to a freak accident which gave him superhuman powers to defy time and manipulate matter.  Fascinatingly, as the other characters portray human foibles and issues, this character through his dissociation with our reality make him no less human in terms of being able to be manipulated, while on the other hand his abilities seem to serve to show the uniqueness of the human condition as he fails to understand the motivations of others.  And in short order, a few other things have to be mentioned - the acting is surprisingly good, the violence is surprisingly graphic in places, and the soundtrack is wonderfully eclectic.<br />In short, we have a very rare beast, a special effects driven blockbuster which has imagination and above all - brains.  Your view of this movie may well hinge on your familiarity with the original source material, but whether you have read the graphic novel or not, this is well worth your time, even if it clocks in at a way too long 2hrs 42 minutes.. in fact you may find you have to watch it again just to decide if you like it or not...</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>The movie was a little bit dark (the superheroes in this parallel universe literally kill their enemies) but I found it entertaining throughout.  The movie starts with the murder of The Comedian, a sometimes hero, most times a nasty bully acting as a hero.  He was part of a group of masked adventurers called the Watchmen.  Most of the Watchmen were retired but they get together at the funeral and each has their memories of the group that go back to the 1940's.<br /><br />There is also a "doomsday" clock that slowly moves closer to 12:00.  All the television pundits believe that Dr. Manhattan has the answer.  Dr. Manhattan is a brilliant scientist who absorbed a huge radiation blast and became a blue skinned mutant that has the ability to alter his size, teleport and split into different bodies. He also seems to parade around naked much of the time and is not modest about full frontal nudity.  He is the most powerful of the Watchman and is virtually indestructible.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, the story is focused on on of the Watchmen's quest to find out who is trying to murder the group members and the dark daliances of the Comedian from him trying to rape another hero, to his brutilization of the Vietnamese during the Viet Nam war including the woman who carries his child.<br /><br />Nixon plays a big part as he was elected to a third term in this parallel world.<br /><br />I found the movie very fast paced which is the opposite of what the critics had said and wouldn't mind a sequel if one is in the works.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Watchmen" is excellent! This is how the story goes: In an alternate 1985 America, costumed superheroes are part of the fabric of everyday society, and the "Doomsday Clock" - which charts the USA's tension with the Soviet Union - is permanently set at five minutes to midnight. When one of his former colleagues is murdered, the washed-up but no less determined masked vigilante Rorschach sets out to uncover a plot to kill and discredit all past and present superheroes. As he reconnects with his former crime-fighting legion - a ragtag group of retired superheroes, only one of whom has true powers - Rorschach glimpses a wide-ranging and disturbing conspiracy with links to their shared past and catastrophic consequences for the future. Their mission is to watch over humanity...but who is watching the watchmen?<br /><br />The cast led by Malin Akerman (as Laurie Jupiter / Silk Spectre II), Billy Crudup (as Dr. Manhattan / Jon Osterman), Matthew Goode (as Adrian Veidt / Ozymandias), Jackie Earle Haley (as Walter Kovacs / Rorschach), Jeffrey Dean Morgan (as Edward Blake / The Comedian), & Patrick Wilson (as Dan Dreiberg / Nite Owl II) is excellent!

This is smart, interesting, and slick. This is one of the best films of the new year, thus far.</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>[...]<br /><br />Wanted to see this movie mainly because I like the director, Zack Snyder, who did "300"---which was just a really fun, hyper-testosteroned but well-crafted action flick. S<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />- nice dark subtext, anti-heroic superheroes, zero pretense of moral piety<br />- nice soundtrack, esp. the opening 5 minutes set to Dylan's "The Times They Are A-Changin'"<br />- excellent pacing, atmospherics, special FX ... visually gorgeous, most of it.<br />- lotsa juicy bone-crunching, blood-splattering, limb-dismembering fight scenes<br />- Jackie Earle Haley as Rorshach, what an amazing stand-out performance!<br /><br />What wasn't so great:<br /><br />- Malin Ackerman as Laurie Jupiter. Cute, sort of, but not that great. So-so actress.<br />- the sex scene between Ackerman and Patrick Wilson where they get the big O in the hovercraft which then spurts a big jet of flame. Cheesy-ometer about went through the roof.<br />- the ending: not that I *demand* happy endings, but this one just felt a little redundant after having watched "The Dark Knight."<br />- conservative bias --- there's a fair bit of liberal-bashing but no equal time for conservative bashing, despite the film's setting: a totally corporatist American dictatorship run by one Tricky Dick Nixon, big-time Republican scumbag.<br />- a number of dead spots in the script when things get a bit too corny and/or the cast is being asked to deliver far more than it can deliver<br /><br />Yeah, I'd probably see this film again. Would I want to own it? Probably not.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AIY4H4KWR2KWZ.html">AIY4H4KWR2KWZ</a><br/><p>Beautiful to watch, difficult to understand or enjoy.<br /><br />That has to be the most common complaint I hear whenever poor 'civilians' are thrown in to this disjointed product - I genuinely feel bad for the masses. As a young man who was active in the comics world during the release of The Watchmen, I can attest to the astounding and ground-breaking impact it had on storytelling, art, and vision. It was the Star Wars of comics - laying waste to the uninspired, underperforming and often flat world that was comic books at the time. When it ended its 1-year run - The Watchmen had changed an entire industry - it was THAT amazing.<br /><br />But this visually rich film fails at capturing, what is at it's core, a mystery. Who Is killing The Watchmen? And why?<br /><br />The film is so non-linear that it's very near impossible for the average viewer to take in and process. It's 1953, now it's 1985, now it's 1971, now it's 1944, now it's 1979, now it's... you get the point. Too muddied, too disconnected, too many plotlines to properly thread together a meaningful story.<br /><br />As a fan, I 'got' what was being offered, and if we were all comic geeks, I think we would be unanimous at this stupendous achievement.<br /><br />Sadly, and I think this is lost amongst fellow nerds, MOST of the audience are not, and will not, become hardcore fans just to see a film. That Director Snyder sought out the approval of the fans is what unfortunately sinks this film into the mess that the average viewer has to sort out for themselves.<br /><br />What should have been the focal point, as in the original storyline, was Rorschach. It should've been made clear that it's from his perspective all the surrounding stories swirl. He is us - the audience. We're being taken along a complex  investigation about the deaths of his former comrades. THAT should've been the foundation upon which this story should've been told. But what we get is a mishmash of introductions, flashbacks, intersecting plotlines, dropped plotlines, missed & missing connections - all carried along with spectacular visuals that sadly lose their meaning since it's not placed within the context of  a story that we can readily absorb.<br /><br />Solution: You start at the past. An introduction of characters; a brief synopsis of who and what they are; what their relations are to one another; what happened to them throughout the years. Boom - 25 minutes of film - the stage is set for the rest of the story. But what happens? Well... what happened.<br /><br />Watching the Watchmen is like eating cotton candy - visually and texturally appealing, but ultimately leaving you empty inside.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>I went into this will big expectations because all I heard from fanboys was how this was going to be the greatest movie ever made. I've never heard of the Watchmen before this movie so I had no idea what it was about. I thought the movie had an interesting story about super heroes being killed off but all the side stories with them covering their origins bored me to tears. That's my biggest problem with the movie. Most of it is boring. It's very long and very boring. I didn't care about any of the characters. They're all depressing. The movie didn't pick up until the last 20min and by then I was already half asleep.<br /><br />Watchmen fans probably enjoyed it more than I did. I'm a huge fan of super hero comic movies. But this one did nothing for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SU3TXON36T0X.html">A3SU3TXON36T0X</a><br/><p>Who watches the watchmen?  Watchmen (2008) is supposed to be a film adaptation of a graphic novel by Alan Moore.  The film takes place in an alternate 1985 where Nixon has been elected for three terms and where Russia and the USA are about to engage in a massive nuclear war.  The "doomsday clock" is set at 5 until midnight.  Unfortunately that's all the movie offers.  The superhero characters are rather pathetic.  The only character that is even moderately interesting is the disturbed hero Rorschach.  The Dr. Manhattan character which everyone raves about is particularly stupid.  The film is disconnected, goes nowhere, and is utterly boring.  The ending with "The Smartest Man in the World" falls completely flat.  And, the homosexual undertones, rape scene, male nudity, and gratuitous sex scenes certainly aren't helping it any.  Ugh.  Ultimately I feel that it was pretty boring and not worthwhile.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>First, I should start by announcing that I have never read the very popular graphic novel "Watchmen', the source for the new film directed by Zach Snyder ("300"). I'm not sure that makes a difference, but I know there are a lot of ardent admirers out there and I hope these same admirers will read this review with an open mind. If not an open mind, at least with the ability to recognize the fact that others may not like the film as much as the diehard fans of the graphic novel probably do.<br /><br />In the 1940s, the Minutemen form together to become a force of superheroes, prepared to help people in their time of need. Among this group are the Night Owl, Silk Specter (Carla Gugino), the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and Jon Osterman (Billy Crudup) who is involved in an accident at his lab and becomes Dr. Manhattan. The Minutemen are a ragtag group who wear hand-sewn costumes and basically fight villains with their bare hands. They are treated as heroes and this status seems to affect many of them in the wrong way. As time passes, some of these folks retire, others continue working for the government and some new folks join the group. Flash forward to "Present Day". It is 1985. Nixon is still in the White House and superheroes have been banned after one too many protests. So, the current Watchmen, Laurie Jupiter (Malin Akerman), Silk Spectre's daughter has taken over the reigns and now becomes Silk Spectre II, Night Owl II is now Dan Dreiberg (Patrick Wilson). Rohrshack (Jackie Earle Haley) and Ozymandias, who's alter ego Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode) is an industrialist, have gone, more or less, undercover. The US and Russia appear to be getting closer and closer to a nuclear war, promising certain annihilation. In fact, this possibility leads Dr. Manhattan to exile because his ability to see the future doesn't paint a good image for him. When the Comedian is murdered, the group reunites, in a fashion, and begins to investigate his murder, leading them to some surprising revelations.<br /><br />"Watchmen" as an idea is better than "Watchmen" as a film. From the moment I first saw trailers about this film, I was intrigued and gradually became more excited as the release date approached and I became aware of how many ardent fans there are of the graphic novel. Basically, a story about superheroes, these characters come from more real places, have more human emotions and problems, and get into more violent situations. In short, a more adult superhero experience. Great. Sign me up.<br /><br />Zach Snyder, the 'visionary' (as the trailers and commercials for the film proclaim) director who created "300" is probably the right choice to bring this highly visual universe to reality. The Watchmen inhabit a sort of alternative universe. Nixon is still the President, enjoying his fifth term in office because he is so popular. We won the Vietnam War, thanks in large part to the members of the Watchmen (The Comedian and Dr. Manhattan are shown in combat). So things are different in this world. And everything appears real. Yet, it also has that comic book sort of appearance. Especially when some of the characters become their alter egos. Dan Dreiberg could be an extrapolation of Clark Kent. Snyder seems to have an innate sense of how to show us everything we need while filling in all of the extra space with unique and interesting details.<br /><br />But Snyder doesn't seem to have as good a handle on both narrative and character development.<br /><br />From what I understand, Snyder adheres pretty closely to the source material, so perhaps this is a criticism that should be addressed to Alan Moore and the other folks behind the graphic novel. But as director, Snyder is ultimately responsible for all elements of the finished film and can make (and should have made?) changes to the story to strengthen it. I suppose if he had changed the story too much, he would have heard about it from the legions of fans, so he's damned if he does and damned if he doesn't.<br /><br />Yes, these characters are more human and more adult than many superheroes. And some of this works. For instance, a burgeoning relationship between Silk Spectre II and Night Owl II (Malin Ackerman and Patrick Wilson) leads to a believable place in this relationship, attributing some real moments to the film's R rating. But because they are also more human and more adult, they are not necessarily squeaky-clean characters. Or in some cases, even likable. Is it necessary to like a superhero? I kind of think it is. If you don't like a superhero, can you root for him to win a battle against the 'villain'? And in "Watchmen", it gets even more complicated than that. Is there a villain? A true villain who is working for a bad end? That is, at best, debatable.<br /><br />Yes, Snyder seems to have fun creating certain environments for the characters. But he has already shown he can do this with the interesting and very visual "300", which was an unexpected and very good film. In "Watchmen" he creates dingy, grimy cities circa mid 40s and mid 80s. He also creates more than a few superhero-type fortresses and shows us the interior of a vehicle used by the new crew of the Watchmen. It is an interesting film visually. Because the film presents an alternate history of our country from a certain point, everything looks similar, but these similar items also look a little surreal. Grimy things are grimier, sexy people are sexier, beautiful things are more beautiful. This aspect of the film is accomplished in spades.<br /><br />Snyder takes these moments of realism to an extreme. As the Watchmen battle various bad guys, using their fists and karate kicks, we see bones break and blood spurt. This is an interesting addition, and helps to make the story seem more adult. But Snyder also seems to linger more on the broken leg, for example. When the leg breaks, his camera slows down and lingers briefly on the broken limb, highlighting this moment of it. It is brief, but because he pauses and accentuates the action, it is all the more memorable. And maybe even disturbing.<br /><br />"Visionary director Zach Snyder"? Something about the Warner Bros. publicity department labeling the director of their own film as "visionary" rubs me the wrong way. Snyder may very well be a great new talent, but visionary? This is a label that should be bestowed after years of great films. As a marketing tool it just seems desperate.<br /><br />The actors are serviceable if unremarkable in their various roles. Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Jackie Earle Haley are certainly the best of the bunch, as they each play the most complicated characters. Morgan (TV's "Grey's Anatomy") plays the Comedian, a super hero who seems to enjoy many vices, smoking, booze, killing, and only occasionally tries to do the right thing. Having been around the longest, he also has the opportunity to become the most interesting. He has seen many things in his life as a superhero, both good and bad, and it isn't completely clear how these have affected him.<br /><br />Jackie Earle Haley ("Little Children", "Breaking Away") plays Rohrshack, a member of the Watchmen who has difficulty controlling his anger. When the Comedian is murdered, he leads the rest of the Watchmen in the investigation, propelling them into the rest of the story. He is also the most aggressive, hiding his real features behind a mask (that looks like the same thing Scarecrow wore in "Batman Returns") covered with ever changing ink blots, he attacks most people with the slightest provocation. And he doesn't stop until he makes sure the deed is done.<br /><br />Patrick Wilson ("Little Children") plays Dan Dreiberg whose alter ego Night Owl II seems to be the moral compass of the group. As Dreiberg, he looks like Clark Kent, complete with thick-rimmed glasses and nerdish looks. As Night Owl, we learn he inherited a lot of money allowing him to set up the headquarters for the Watchmen. There is a very good scene when he and Silk Spectre, as their alter egos, are confronted by a large group of hoodlums. Against seemingly invincible odds, they quickly dispatch the group.<br /><br />Malin Ackerman plays Silk Spectre II and is the daughter of Silk Spectre (Carla Gugino), who now spends all her time in a booze-shrouded mist. Ackerman is certainly very pretty, but she is kind of boring as an actress. Every time she appears on screen, her facial expression seems to be the same. She is interested in both Dr. Manhattan and Night Owl and both are interested in her. She also uncovers a dark secret about her past and confronts her mother with the truth.<br /><br />Billy Crudup, an actor I usually greatly admire and enjoy, plays Dr. Manhattan. Manhattan, a former scientist who gets caught in one of his experiments, gains a power allowing him to control all of the molecules in his body. This same experiment turns him blue. And seems to rob him of the need to wear clothes. It is more than a little disconcerting to see a computer-generated character designed to look like an outstanding body builder. And to see this man walking around naked, with his blue testicles hanging out for most of the film. I think the idea is that Dr. Manhattan's accident has caused him to reach a new level of power and enlightenment. He doesn't need to live on Earth. And doesn't appear to like to live on Earth. And wonders why he should try to save a planet he no longer has any ties to. During a conversation with Silk Spectre, he takes her to Mars so they can converse more freely. Of course, she has difficulty breathing and he quickly creates a safe building for her. But why go to Mars in the first place? There are a lot of questions left unanswered in "Watchmen".<br /><br />And I don't get some of the alternative reality references. For instance, why is Nixon still in office in 1985? A co-worker tried to tell me that this made him more of a monarch than a President, and this is what gave him so much power. But these points of argument must come from the graphic novel, because they certainly aren't explored in the film. Nixon only makes a few appearances and no one really seems to be affected by him that much. And why have a monarch at all when it doesn't seem to really affect the story<br /><br />"Watchmen" is interesting visually, but the acting and narrative are a few KAPOWS short of a masterpiece. Quite a few ZOWIES.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I'm so glad I did not buy this! I rented it, and didn't think it was all that great! There were some sweet bloody scenes, and some cool special effects, but the rest was very boring. When a superhero called The Comedian is killed, Doctor Manhattan, Rorschach, Silk Spectre II, and Night Owl II try to figure out why. Rorscach was my favorite character because of his attitude. I really didn't like the way the movie ended. I wouldn't recommend WATCHMEN!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>I have to admit that it's hard to love the movie Watchmen. In my opinion, it's not as great as I had hoped. The only good things about this are the fantastic action and visuals. The fascinating character of Rorschach is also a welcome addition. But sadly, everything else doesn't add up. The characters aren't fully fleshed out (even the flashbacks aren't enough). The script needed some improvements (there were some silly dialogue here and there). Malin Akerman and Matthew Goode were horrible in this movie (couldn't they have at least tried?). Of course, it's just my opinion. It's fine my me if you love Watchmen. But to me, this didn't keep me interested. I give it a D instead of an F, mainly because of Rorschach and the special effects.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>A comedian died in New York. Someone threw him out of a window and when he hit the sidewalk his head was driven into his stomach. The only person that seems to care is Rorschach, the one superhero who refuses to take off his mask. The Keene Act was passed in 1977 banning all forms of costumed crimefighting. Rorschach continues to do so as he feels his mask is his true face. His theory is that someone is out to kill costumed heroes and that it's his responsibility to inform his former colleagues. There's Dan Dreiberg/Nite Owl II whom Rorschach used to be partners with before Dan retired, Adrian Veidt/Ozymondias, one of two costumed heroes to make his identity public who's also a self-made millionaire and considered to be the smartest man in the world, Dr. Jon Osterman/Dr. Manhattan, the only one of the group who has genuine super powers thanks to an accident that nearly killed him who is now commissioned by the government, Laurie Jupiter/Silk Spectre II, her mother was in the Minutemen along with The Comedian and wanted her daughter to follow in her footsteps, and finally Edward Blake/The Comedian, another superhero commissioned by the government that knows more than he should while his knowledge takes its toll on him and whoever is around him at the time thanks to his reckless and sadistic behavior. What any of them fail to realize is that there's a conspiracy going on that's bigger than any of them could have ever imagined.<br /><br />I had watched the motion comic in its entirety earlier in the week to get myself ready for this and it had really gotten me excited for this film. The first time I read Watchmen, I thought it was good but not great. However, I thoroughly enjoyed it the second time through. My biggest question going into the film is how I would feel about the altered ending since I already knew about that going into it. Turns out that the ending in question wasn't so bad, but I wasn't happy with some of the other things that were changed or left out to lead up to said ending.<br /><br />The film is pretty much right on the money the majority of the time. Zack Snyder continues his trend of pulling panels directly from the source material and making them a cinematic reality. The dialogue is often times word for word from the graphic novel and doesn't feel forced or out of place when something new is used. The cast left nothing to be complained about as they all did a great job. Jackie Earle Haley was a fantastic Rorschach. He sounded just the way I expected Rorschach to sound and just looked like a splitting image of Walter Kovacs. Billy Crudup's emotionless Dr. Manhattan was also pretty much just as I envisioned. Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian was the one I seemed to be most pleased with. He did a great job making you care about this costumed superhero who did brutally sadistic things to people yet somehow still made you care about his character. Snyder's use of slow motion seems to be used more efficiently this time around. It felt like it was used only when needed rather than just to be eye candy. The effects used with Dr. Manhattan are worth a mention. Even if he's just standing there, you can tell how much time and effort was put into making him look spectacular. Let alone cost quite a bit of money. Rorschach's mask was also an interesting special effect that is sure to catch anyone's eye. The effects are pretty flawless and should please most moviegoers.<br /><br />There was a lot of material left out of the film or changed that I wasn't particularly happy with. I don't want to seem too nitpicky, so I'll only touch base on a few of them. I view most of the stuff that was left out as character development that was important to the overall story. Most of the material in question concerns Rorschach; he visited Adrian Veidt to warn him of his mask killer theory not Dan, his response to The Keene Act, Walter Kovac's landlady, anything concerning his apartment, and his drop box, where he hides his mask during the day, everything about his psychiatrist's relationship bending and breaking during the course of the Rorschach case, how and where he got the mask, how he disposed of the man who kidnapped that little girl, and it just keeps going. Most of that was left out of the theatrical version of the film. Around the halfway point to the end of the film, I felt like it just strayed further and further away from the source material. In the novel, Dr. Manhattan is the only superhero with superpowers. The film kind of leaves that up in the air since other characters are seen punching stone off of walls and jumping to inhuman heights into the air. It was just kind of a, "Wait...what?" kind of moment for me. I realize it was probably just the wirework used that I'm questioning, but it didn't sit well with me.<br /><br />I'm hoping the final cut of the film that's rumored to be three hours to three and a half hours long puts some of these important bits (including Hollis' death and The Black Freighter storyline among other things) back into the story. It wasn't that I didn't enjoy it, but it wound up just not meeting my expectations. My recommendation is don't read the graphic novel before viewing the film. The film is worthwhile for Zack Snyder enthusiasts, comic book fans, and pretty much anyone looking for a good action film. I would recommend it to just about anyone, but I think that ultimate version of the DVD is going to be what fans will really be excited over and for good reason. As a film, it's incredibly entertaining. In comparison to the graphic novel, it comes up a bit short. For now, I just see it as a good film that could have been a lot better.<br /><br />Rating: 7/10</p></br><a href="../users/ARFCORBCTKX1J.html">ARFCORBCTKX1J</a><br/><p>It's tempting to dismiss this film by saying that any movie made from such a poor novel would /have/ to be an improvement. And it /is/ an improvement, which explains my two-star review of the film (compared to my one-star review of the novel -- QV, as they say in Latin).<br /><br />No one has had the guts to stand up and say that the novel is a shallow and ultimately pointless work. The issues raised by "Watchmen" were raised more than 70 years ago when Superman and Batman became the prototypes of almost every superhero to come. They need little elaboration, any more than one needs to be told that water is wet. Dr Wertham was wrong about comic books causing anti-social behavior, but he and other philosophers/psychologists correctly analyzed why super-heroes are (for better or worse) popular.<br /><br />There are no real-world superheros (as much as people like Ronald Reagan might like to think there are), which therefore renders super-hero comics a self-contained and self-referential commentary on themselves and society. A commentary /on/ a commentary, from a comic-book writer, seems pointless navel-gazing. My reaction to the novel was largely "Yeah, right... So what?".<br /><br />The film blunts much (but not enough) of the novel's intellectual pretentiousness, while discarding too much of its moral ambiguity. We are left feeling that Ozymandias was justified in killing millions of people to prevent a much greater catastrophe. And the idea that the governments of the Earth would unite against a common foe and stop fighting among themselves is not plausible. "The Shield of Achilles" gives a not-unreasonable explanation of the sources of human warfare, which would not be long-suppressed by an alien enemy. *<br /><br />The film's dialog is not far-removed from the novel's, which is unfortunate. It's not at the level of Stephen J Cannell, let alone "The Sopranos". The acting is barely adequate, with Malin Ackerman decidedly unconvincing. The actor playing Nixon has been given a prosthetic nose that makes him look as if he's auditioning for a production of "Cyrano".<br /><br />Ultimately, I find "Watchmen" not so much pointless as a shallow rehash of the patently obvious. It holds your attention, though, and its 3-hour running time passes quickly and smoothly.<br /><br />"Watchmen" is an extremely violent film, which I don't consider suitable for anyone under 17 or 18, even with parents in attendance. There are scenes of two dogs fighting over the leg bone of a little girl they've torn to pieces, and a convict having his arms cut off with a circular saw. A decade ago, these would likely have gotten the film an NC-17. And people complain about "Brokeback Mountain".<br /><br />* The film changes the foe from an alien invasion to Dr Manhattan.</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>i got done watching this movie only twenty minutes ago.i was so moved by it,i rushed right to my dinosaur computer and put forth this review.<br />  i thought this movie was going to be a stupid x-men rip off.it was however not that at all.whoever wrote and directed this movie will sink to any low.there is no line that they will not cross.there is rape,a pregnant woman being executed,a 6 year old girl being mutilated and fed to dogs and thats just the worst stuff.this movie is very graphic and very detailed.i think i have a very good stomach for movie violence but this is just sick!not to mention the rape victim continualy says she didnt mind.its beyond what should be allowed.i know that goes against the first ammendment but this hollywood crap asks once again "were they right?"<br /><br />ok,that off my chest,the movie was a secret society type movie.i hate it when the movie is very secretive and stuff until the end.i mean why advertise it as a comic book movie at all?why not "mystery"?then we would know we will sit through 90 plus minutes of questions and 5 minutes of confusing answers.<br />also,the super heroes werent even in thier prime ,they were all old.it was like a million dollar version of mermaid man and barnacle boy from sponge bob.it had that 1920s jazzy feel to it.<br />now,the super heroes are viewed as the bad guys in this one.they were brutal and the enforcers and it pissed people off.<br />the 2 biggest losers in the whole movie are those who survive too.that was no good.of course i cant say who here.<br />this one guy called "comedian" was played by wayne gayle from "natural born killers".he was a very nuerotic wanna be cop gone tv parasite in that movie.i dont care if he is iron man or comedian or who .he is always going to be that dorky talk show guy.<br />but,there were some good points.the "smartest man in the world",was a great character.and dr manhatten was one of the coolest characters of all time even though he seems like a silver surfer rip off only he teleports.he is way cooler than silver surfer though.his ho-bag girl friend sais something like "everthing is quantum mechanics and alternate universes with this guy".its cool to see that they took a genius and made him cool.<br />the special effects were both good and bad.the nuclear holocaust was less than stellar.most of the stuff with dr manhatten was awesome!but,the violence was either cool stuff we wanted to see as pre teens like knees getting snapped and the bone coming out OR was totaly gross,way too much information and just gross!<br />so thats why i gave it a 3 star rating.the awesome stuff is 5 star quality.the bad stuff was 1 star quality.[i couldnt give it less].so theres your average!</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>It's a beautifully filmed, nicely edited, with particular attention to special effects, film that has an uncertain plot and a weird understanding of the world and its audience. It's the kind of movie that no one really understands but appreciates its sincerity and accomplishment. At the end of the day though, it's not a film that I would rewatch or watch the sequel to it. As it is, I'm glad I saw it in IMAX because, as i mentioned above, the film is visually stunning.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q.html">A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q</a><br/><p>Watched this film on opening day. Watchmen stars Malin Akerman as Silk Spectre II (her mom was the original), Billy Crudup plays Dr Manhattan (the only character with super powers in the film), Jackie Haley plays Rorschach (my favorite) the sole remaining vigilante who did not quit when the government ordered the "masks" to stop fighting crime. Jeffrey Morgan plays The Comedian (see picture) whose death begins the story. And Patrick Wilson plays Nite Owl II (think Batman).<br /><br />Okay, there are many more characters but I don't feel like writing about all of them.<br /><br />The plot, The Comedian is thrown out of a window and Rorshach believes someone is targeting the old crimefighters.<br /><br />His mission is to warn those who he was affiliated with.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Dr Manhattan, a being who can manipulate matter, is working on a way to harness his energy to create the perfect source of fuel for the world.<br /><br />So is someone going after the Watchmen? And will the world end up nuking themselves to oblivion? Watch the movie.<br /><br />Or don't because it's really long and really boring.<br /><br />Really - really boring.<br /><br />It's directed by the guy who made 300 (another film based on a graphic novel) so there's a lot of slow-motion action scenes with lots of bloody violence and too much nudity.<br /><br />"Too much" you ask? Yes - there really doesn't need to be any. We're talking about a man who glows blue and doesn't wear a single article of clothing...<br /><br />Die hard fans will watch this, but I won't be getting this on DVD</p></br><a href="../users/A10DB0H2NZF11E.html">A10DB0H2NZF11E</a><br/><p>I rented this movie for $4 and I overpaid by $3. It is horrible from the beginning to end. It always looks like it's gonna turn around and become worth watching but it never does.....NEVER!<br /><br />I gave it 1 star and that's only because some of the "special fx" were good [not great]. The story line is horrible and the ending is so bad that you have to see it to believe it but, I wouldn't wish that on you and you're just a stranger reading this review.<br /><br />Bad! Bad! Grab Your Money and Run Away!</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>Or<br />No Country For Old Super-Heroes<br /><br />THE WATCHMEN is another movie based on a comic book - er, GRAPHIC NOVEL. First  picked up in 1986 by 20th Century Fox, the project bounced around the world from the US to the UK to Czechoslovakia, resting briefly at just about every major studio in the world. There were multiple scripts drafted, multiple directors tapped, and a Who's-Who of Hollywood talent courted for the lead roles.  In the end, we got exactly what you'd expect to get: a mess.<br /><br />Think of THE WATCHMEN as The Incredibles, only a lot less entertaining. This is a live-action story of the last of the super-heroes. At the start of the film, we are treated to a wonderful montage that tells us "the story so far." I'm not exaggerating when I say we're treated to it. It's the best part of the film. They should have stopped right there, but they didn't. And I hear that the DVD has 20 minutes MORE for us to suffer through. That comes to 182 minutes of watch-watching pain. I digress.<br /><br />THE WATCHMEN is set in 1985. Richard Nixon is somehow in his third term, the Soviet Union is about to nuke us, and a giant blue super-hero named Doctor Manhattan straddles the world. Naked. (He's naturally blue, too.) Doctor Manhattan is omnipotent which makes him boring. His pal is called Ozymandias, after the Percy Shelley poem. He's all-knowing which makes him petulant and boring. Then there's Doctor Manhattan's love interest, her mom, her former love interest (pretty but boring, boring in bad make-up, could be interesting but is as boring as day-old toast) and the Comedian, an absolutely unlikeable guy who rapes, murders, and laughs about it all. I wish he had been boring, but he was just disturbing.<br /><br />The only interesting character in THE WATCHMEN is Rorschach. His face is an ever-shifting Rorschach ink pattern, which is really cool but odd since he is the only one who doesn't waver in his ideals and commitment. He's a hard-boiled detective who has completely lost sight of the "the line." He doesn't need no stinkin' line. He makes his own line. Rorschach is really the driving force of the flick. His scenes are interesting, understandable, and move the plodding plot along. Even so, some of his scenes are gruesome and unnecessary for the character or the story.<br /><br />Honestly, I get disgusted remembering THE WATCHMEN, not because of the needless gore but because of the wasted effort. The cinematography is wonderful, the soundtrack is classic, but the acting is dreadful and the story is deadly dull with a wholly unsatisfying ending. Yes, I admit it; I sat through the whole thing. I was just HOPING something good would happen. And it did! THE WATCHMEN finally ended.</p></br><a href="../users/A29TKSIWA3JKF3.html">A29TKSIWA3JKF3</a><br/><p>Sad to say, this movie put me off instantly, during the opening credits no less.  I don't know if that was because I had no other reference point to go by, having never heard of Watchmen or the novel it's taken from.  This left me with no other option than what was presented.  They say presentation is everything, and in this case, Watchmen can't be faulted on style.  On everything else though, serious sensory overload: the music was too loud and intrusive, the undeveloped plot difficult to follow, the `mood' lighting completely left me in the dark (figuratively and literally).  The opening fight sequence was almost completely lost on me, seeing that it was purposely obscured, as was much of this film.  There were far too many flashbacks, hinting at what, most felt incomplete.  There were also far too many characters to juggle, most of them thoroughly unlikable and dealt with in a limited fashion.  It was difficult to pinpoint the villain of the piece as so many were villainous at one time or another.  When the `true' villain was eventually revealed he proved to be so bland and banal it made everything that had come before the great revelation completely laughable.  As the story meandered for 186 minutes I kept thinking, what's the point?  Even when it finally ended, I kept thinking, what's the point?<br />I found this movie smug, pretentious, humorless, and not a little snide.  Being dated was the least of its worries.  Alternate universe or not, it still had to battle for a modicum of relevancy.  And that droning narration throughout was of no help whatsoever.  I didn't just dislike this movie, I hated it.  Even on a cursory level, it failed to entertain me.  Not a keeper and I'm sorry I bought it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>This action movie sins in the worst possible way - it's boring! There's no sense of fun anywhere (see 'Iron Man'), and the action sequences are dull and predictable (has no one seen the 'Kill Bill' movies? They came out years ago!). Even the acting was pretty stilted - I thought Rorschach was pretty decent, but everyone else was bland, bland, bland.<br /><br />I dunno - maybe it doesn't help that I never read the comic book (excuse me, "graphic novel"). I wonder if this is what it was like for outsiders to watch 'Lord of the Rings'? In which, for me, it was ultra-cool to all my favorite characters come to life, and I loved every entrance and how faithful it was to the book; I was just overwhelmed. Maybe this movie does that for 'Watchmen' fans, I dunno. But for me, I couldn't wait for the end.<br /><br />(The disparity between die-hard fans and everyone else might also explain why the IMDB rating is a very high 7.9, but metacritic is significantly lower at 56)</p></br><a href="../users/A1K3NQAO49LXL2.html">A1K3NQAO49LXL2</a><br/><p>The Watchmen graphic novel (i.e. comic book) by Alan Moore is a masterpiece.  This film is the next best thing.  Although it doesn't capture all of the graphic novel in its entirety - how could it? - it does a great job with those bits that it does.  The ending has been changed somewhat, but I thought this had been done in a way that was actually a bit better than the graphic novel in parts (the disaster at the end of the graphic novel does come off as a bit absurd), although Dr Manhattan's decision at the end is ultimately not satisfying (and a bit similar to the Batman's decision at the end of The Dark Knight, come to think of it...).  The characters are all very well cast, with the exception perhaps of Dr Manhattan, who is just a bit too CG-ized for my liking.  Oh well, why be a scrooge when the framing was so masterful, and Rorsach so superbly crafted.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OXHLG6DIBRW8.html">A3OXHLG6DIBRW8</a><br/><p>"Watchmen" is a surprisingly good Superhero movie. Set in an alternate timeline in 1985 where Richard Nixon is on his fifth term as president and the world is on the brink of nuclear war. I missed it in the theaters but managed to catch the Director's Cut on Amazon "Video on Demand".<br /><br />This a world where some of the "heroes" are far darker than Batman and are significantly more morally flawed than any of the comic book heroes of my childhood. That being said, these are much more human and therefore much easier to understand, with the exception of the often naked Dr. Manhattan who started as human has become very alien indeed.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me, the story centers on the very disturbing hero Rorschach as he tries to figure out who is killing retired (forcibly, by law) masked avengers. Also appearing are The Comedian, Silk Specter II, Night-Owl, and several other retired heroes. All of this takes place against the backdrop of impending global destruction as the US and Soviets prepare to heat up the Cold War.<br /><br />The cinematography is nothing short of amazing, the mood is set perfectly by the camera shots, lighting, and soundtrack. There are also some outstanding special effects that really add to the realism of the movie. Other than the somewhat gratuitous scenes with Dr. Manhattan's digitally created glowing full frontal nudity, there was very little I didn't enjoy with the technical side of the movie.<br /><br />The movie has a very graphic love scene and shows a lot of actual human nudity. There is also a good bit of graphic violence and gore, as well as questionable application of vigilantly justice.<br /><br />Recommended, with the above caveats.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>The 1985 graphic novel of Watchmen by comic book great Alan Moore is one of the most impressionable pieces of literature that I've read in years. And Zack Snyder's movie interpretation is one of the few films that I've ever seen that kept so closely true to the book.<br /><br />Is Watchmen a movie about superheroes? Actually, I believe that the characters prefer "costumed adventurers" instead of superheroes...with the exception of one character in particular. The difference between superhero and costumed adventurer here is the difference between super-powers and plain old bravery and smarts. And just plain old bravery and smarts can't protect you from a bullet or a stronger man (or woman).<br /><br />So when one of the approximately five still practicing costumed adventurers called The Comedian is murdered, Rorschach, a tough, shifting-ink-blot mask wearing anti-hero makes it his business to find the killer and warn the other adventurers of a villain potentially bent on getting rid of the remaining "masks".<br /><br />I mentioned earlier "an exception" to the costumed versus super-powered adventurers...that exception is Dr. Manhattan. The question is not what can Dr. Manhattan do that's so special; the question is, what can't he do? So with a guy like Manhattan on your side...whether it's literally "your" side or say "your county's" side, ya can't lose, right?<br /><br />But what if Dr. Manhattan decided to skip town for a while? Yeah. Exactly. You guessed it. Like if Tiger Woods left golf for a season due to injury...who'd watch golf anymore? Who'd watch the Watchmen?<br /><br />I'd certainly recommend the novel over the movie, but what else is new? That's always the case with novels turned movies. The ending of the movie mirrors the novel with bit of a change and even makes a bit more sense as the twists and turns of a diabolical plot are unveiled. But as I said earlier, this minor alteration in the integrity of the story originally told by Alan Moore in graphic novel form does really not affect the brilliance of the original concept.<br /><br />If you don't have the time for the novel, this 3-hour Director's Cut is a wonderful alternative...not just for comic book and graphic novels fans, but for fans of Truth, Justice and the American Way! Add this to your cart.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>I am a huge fan of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons's astonishing masterpiece and had been really upset about learning that the comic to end all comics was being made into a movie.  I had hoped that if it was going to be made at all, it would be as the miniseries that Terry Gilliam has briefly hoped to make.  But a two or three hour movie?  How could that take place without becoming a travesty?  Then I heard and read all the reviews when the film came out.  The film was passionately hated by huge numbers of fans of the book.  So I decided to avoid the film.  Almost as an afterthought, however, I put the Blu-ray on my Netflix queue.  Even after it reached the top of my queue and arrived in my mailbox, for several days I avoided watching it.  But when I finally put it on to watch, I was pleasantly -- indeed, very pleasantly -- surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  Was it as good as the book?  An absurd question.  Of course not.  Was it a truly great movie?  No.  But by the standards of today's big budget movies, which are as a rule pretty mediocre affairs, I thought WATCHMEN a very good movie indeed.  I think most of the people hating it do so out of a misguided devotion to the book, to an unconscious and mistaken idea that to enjoy the film would somehow be an act of infidelity to the original.  I enjoyed the film.  I might even put it on the list of the ten best superhero movies I've ever seen.  It may not be a masterpiece like the book, but that doesn't mean that it isn't a good film in its own right.<br /><br />The film begins spectacularly and thereafter slows down a bit, even dragging a bit at the end.  But overall the film does a nice job of translating a book into film, despite the conviction that the book was unfilmmable.  I had heard the standard critiques of the film, that it left too much of the book out, that too much of it was merely a frame by frame recreation of the book, but while I knew that some parts were missing (I did get a kick out of seeing the kid reading THE TALE OF THE BLACK FREIGHTER by the newsstand), but I personally didn't feel that the missing parts lessened the narrative laid out before us.  I loved the look of the film, though it had a great soundtrack (I especially loved the use of bits from Philip Glass's SATYAGRAHA during the Dr. Manhattan back story) and liked that they used Leonard Cohen's version of "Hallelujah" during Nite Owl and Silk Spectre's love scene when most films and TV shows use cover versions).  And I especially enjoyed the cast.  Jackie Earle Haley was extraordinary as the sociopath Rorschach, Patrick Wilson as the un-masculine Nite Owl, and Malin Akerman as Silk Spectre.  There were a couple of misses.  Matthew Goode was pretty flat as Adrian Veidt / Ozymandias and Billy Crudup was wasted as Dr. Manhattan, a role that required as little human emotion as possible.  I was once again amazed by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who is one of the most remarkable actors around, a complete chameleon who can play, apparently, any kind of role.  In an age where most leading actors tend to play the same kind of role over and over, Morgan has no type.  I love actors who can continually surprise you with what they are capable of.  He is very fine here as the misanthropic and violent Comedian, the first of the former "masks" to die.<br /><br />There are many who simply will not allow themselves to do anything but hate and detest this movie.  But being objective, I think it was a lot of fun and a very decent movie.  Perhaps those who, like me, are huge fans of the book and have been putting off seeing the film because of the bad press are perhaps the group of people who are most likely to enjoy the film  I frankly enjoyed this so much that I now plan on buying it.<br /><br />On a sidenote, if you are, like me, a fan of the TV shows filmed in Vancouver, it is pretty easy to recognize this as a British Columbia product.  Once you see people like Allesandro Juliani, Jerry Wasserman, Robert Wisden, Don Thompson, Fulvio Cecere, and Rob LaBelle (all of whom, for example, appeared in BATTLESTAR GALACTICA), you know you are watching a Vancouver production.  You almost never see any of these actors in Hollywood productions.  But they all show up in shows like THE X-FILES, SMALLVILLE, DARK ANGEL, the STARGATEs, and EUREKA.  It is like watching a ensemble theater troupe act out their plays.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F.html">A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F</a><br/><p>I was expecting an awesome superhero movie. Some of my friends went to see it and weren't sure how they felt about it. I know now... it sucked.<br /><br />I can't think of many things I liked. I read a little bit of the comic so I could see the comparisons, and the story follows the comic closely. However, the story doesn't play out on the screen as it is essentially not very exciting. There is so much down time in the movie. The action scenes are not choreographed well. Most of them are over WAY too quickly. In a movie that runs nearly 3 hours, there are maybe 30 minutes of action at most. While I don't mind a lot of talking in a movie, all of the talking seems to have no point.<br /><br />The characters also didn't speak to me. Rorschach is a good hero and fleshed out well in the film, but after the movie was over I didn't really have much interest in him anymore. Dr. Manhattan is better done in my opinion. His monologue near the end is performed very well, and while I hated his monotone voice, I felt like it was appropriate to the character. All of the other characters just seemed like they were trying too hard to act. Maybe its just me, but I really couldn't stand most of them.<br /><br />I was bored for the entire length of the movie. Nothing thrilled me. If you have never read the comics, I would skip it, as it isn't a good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1WUMTJOASEL5F.html">A1WUMTJOASEL5F</a><br/><p>Im not sure what this movie is celebrating, superheroes, murder mysteries, evil violence, or just the brand new hope for the end of music as we know it, replacing it with the whining voices that have been shunned or set aside all these years, because it is here they make their grand debut out of our consciousness. At any rate, the soundtrack sucks with over political overtones of the lost 60s, and believe me, if the soundtrack sucks (I would exit a bar that played any of this), the movie does too, cause there is no movie classic with soundtrack that sucks.  Even Thank God It's Friday disco movie had an award winning song in Last Dance. Now that was a real exit.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>You know how all those people who had never read Tolkien complained that, plopped in the middle of the theater for Jackson's trilogy, it was too baffling?  I felt the same way about this:  the plot was far too convoluted to have been a movie.  In fact, I sat through this with a fan who knew all about it.  I had to pepper him with questions right up until the very end.  Not a good sign.<br /><br />Some other observations:<br /><br />1.  The soundtrack for this blows.  No, let me try to be more articulate.  It frequently was a jarring mish-mash between the music and what was happening onscreen.  It was almost as if somebody had put their iPod on random and pushed "play".<br /><br />2.  What's with all the slow motion these days?  Good grief.  It's getting out of hand.  At one point, the characters are crossing the street in slow motion!<br /><br />3.  They should have delimited Dr. Manhattan's powers more believably.  By the time he's smooching that chick on Mars I had pretty much checked out of the movie.<br /><br />4.  What?  No minorities among the Watchmen?  Unacceptable!  When is Hollywood going to learn: the only justification for casting white people is if you need a villain, an airhead, or a gender-bending misfit.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LGT6UZL99IW1.html">A3LGT6UZL99IW1</a><br/><p>I've never looked at the print version - I'm an animation, Anime and SF fan. I found this movie to often be nonsensical and too far over the top.  Yes, the sxf were decent, but not overwhelming, the plot was lame, and the protagonist was a wimp.  I agree with other reviewers - the $10 off the complete version when it's released?! Double-dipping to the extreme.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Somewhere in New York City in an alternate 1985, superheroes have been outlawed and Richard Nixon is still president. A former super soldier named Comedian (Jeffery Dean Morgan) was brutally murdered one night, Comedian's pals from a team called CrimeBusters with heroes like Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) who is a Superman-esque immortal god of powers, blank masked avenger Roschach (Jackie Earl Haley), sexy buttkicker Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) and intelligent Batman-esque Nightowl (Patrick Wilson) are together trying to untangle the mystery of who killed Comedian. They are also trying to find out who is behind an uncanny government conspiracy that could cause World War III for they must find the culprit who is behind this.<br /><br />A brilliant and faithful adaptation of the beloved DC Comics graphic novel from Alan Moore and David Gibbons. After many years since 1987 in development hell through many studios like FOX, Universal, Warner, New Line, Paramount to even MGM trying to make the unfilmable graphic novel into a motion picture as many directors from Terry Gilliam to Darren Arfofsky tried, then after the success of the motion picture adaptation of Frank Miller's 300 Zack Snyder was chosen as director since he's a comic fan. He used the graphic novel as storyboards for the film as the film was a shot-to-shot frame-by-frame nearly adaptation that captures Alan Moore's masterpiece well on the big screen. It also uses the comic's brilliant satire on superheros and political issues that brings the audience to an alternate universe not seen since The Matrix. It's a thrilling, complex, intelligent and ultraviolent film that sure isn't like any superhero film you seen and it's definitely not for children, this is a comic movie for adults. This is R-rated stuff here like the graphic novel with language, a couple of sex scenes with some nudity, gory violence and of course complexity, Greg Cannom's make-up effects are terrific including the motion capture technology for Dr. Manhattan. Co-starring Matt Frewer, this is a must see motion picture for anyone who likes Sci-fi, action, complex thrillers or comic book movies but remember to read the graphic novel first.<br /><br />This version is the best of three cuts since it's the longest and interludes the animated "Tales of the Black Freighter" pirate comic story into the film at times for a more unique experience including 2 commentaries and the extras include the amusing short film "Under teh Hood" which shows the origins of the original Nite Owel, 4 documentaries, music video, 11 video journals and a bonus disc which is the graphic novel motion comic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>This movie could have been a mess. Fortuneately, no missteps were made in bringing this epic graphic novel to life. This movie was made for people familiar with the novel, so read the novel first (I read the original 12-issue series) if you have'nt already. This is a great movie - alot of stuff is going on at multiple levels in this movie.<br /><br />Yes, its a movie about superheroes, but it asks the question "what if they were real people". The human condition is thoroughly examined here with style. One particular theme, in the book, which is in the movie and is very important, is the conflict between the two main characters: Dr. Manhattan and Ozymandias - the god who thought he was a man and the man who thought he was a god. Great stuff.<br /><br />Nothing was half-done in this movie. The cinematography, the acting and the attention to detail all make watching the Watchmen a wonderful movie experience.</p></br></body></html>

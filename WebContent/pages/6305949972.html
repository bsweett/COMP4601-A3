Based on his short story, Tim Burton brought back the concept of stop-motion animation with this in a way Gumby never did.<br /><br />Jack Skellington is the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, and he with his fellow bumpers of the night are in charge of Halloween every year, but totally unaware of any other holidays. After another successful trick-or-treat jamboree, Jack pines for something more to do with his life, and happens to stumble into a magic doorway that leads to Christmas Town, where Santa Claus runs X-mas. Jack falls in love with all things Christmasy, and decides to bring it back home. After doing some more research on it, he proclaims that he'll be the one running Christmas for that year. Everyone in Halloween Town gets on board with it, except for Sally, a Bride of Frankenstein-ish ragdoll girl who has a crush on Jack. Jack sends the trio of Lock, Shock, & Barrel to capture Santa so that he can replace him, but they take Santa to their boss, the slimey Oogie Boogie. Jack's attempt at being Santa totally backfires as he's shot down by the army. He realizes his mistake at trying to take over someone else's holiday, so he goes to get Santa back to save Christmas. Jack battles Oogie in his casino lair to free Santa, where its revealed that Oogie is really a pile of bugs. Santa manages to salvage Christmas for yet another year, and brings the holiday to Halloween Town. Jack then realizes his feelings for Sally, making for a happy ending.<br /><br />This is one of my absolute favorite animated films of all time. When it came out, I was getting out of animation for a while, but this totally brought me back into it. It also makes for a great refresher for the holiday season. As tough as it is to get through that time of year, watching Nightmare always makes it alot more tolerable, and from it you realize that if a skeleton from a horror-based society who knew nothing about Christmas could become a better person after finding it, then it shouldn't be too hard for all the real Scrooges out there either.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>. . . that this is one of the finest animated films of all time. Now do I have to say that this contains some of Danny Elfman's most fantastic music. This is absolutely incredible. The stop-motion animation featured here is so much better than the crappy CGI animation found in "Chicken Little," "Kung Fu Panda," etc. The songs are quite catchy, and I find myself humming them after I see the movie, and listen to the soundtrack. The character designs are spectacular and purely Burtonesque (even though Burton didn't direct this film). It's a fantastic movie, and it first both Halloween and Christmas respectively.<br /><br />Grade: A+</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>I finally found this movie to purchase on e-bay and have enjoyed watching it ever since. I had to avoid the "DVD scalpers" on this website and I was very glad that I did. This movie is a "stand alone" classic that has turned into a cult movie for some cultures. The story is wonderful and the animation is even greater. This movie is also great for watching from Halloween to Christmas and beyond. If you can't purchase it, rent it. It is well worth the owning.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZHH7AK83JB5G.html">A2ZHH7AK83JB5G</a><br/><p>NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS is one of the best Halloween themed films ever made.  The characters and sets are imaginative, well thought out and fully realized especially for fantasy animation.  Danny Elfman's songs are hit show tune  hummable as well as having clever lyrics that add depth and move the plot forward.  Everything in the movie is amazingly and completely detailed making the DVD a joy to watch over and over again.  And of course it is hilariously funny.  It is probably not a great choice for the very young or for anyone easily offended by the unique and unusual but NIGHTMARE is a fantastic Halloween (or any time) choice for everyone else.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>Tim Burton's worldview isn't quite like anyone else's, but that's what makes "Nightmare Before Christmas" such a treat.  Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, is tired of Halloween.  He kidnaps Santa, thinking he can do a better job and ends up creating the halloweeniest Christmas ever.  Some sensitive kids and adults may be disturbed by the imagery and the fun Burton pokes at the holiday.  Definitely for more mature children only.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ.html">A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ</a><br/><p>I have nothing but admiration for the talented and VERY PATIENT guys who endevour to make a movie based on stop/start photography. This must truly be a "labour of love" and the results of their efforts are wondrous. The viewer is introduced to Jack Skellington who is the King Of Halloween but has become jaded with this annual event. There must be millions of guys out in tedious jobs who can relate to Jack's predicament. Then to Jacks great surprise and delight he discovers "Christmastown" where everything is shiny and beautiful. So Jack then kidnaps Santa Claus in the hope of reproducing a wonderful Christmas for all. I marvel at  the novel concept of this movie in a time where most producers are just making stupid "Teenage Sex Comedies' which feature male virgins and of course the obligatory prostitute. This movie is a gem for young and old and I also have got to mention Jack's long suffering girfriend who also springs to vivid life in this movie. Tim Burton Rocks!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>A film of great interest, artistically. It is a Christmas pantomime that reveals a very high level of technical perfection in  animation. It is a very good musical where music and singing are literally merged into the pictures. It is also a very profound film about children : their expectation of fear with Halloween and of joy with Christmas. Children are just like adults, dark on one side and colorful on the other side, and they don't want the two to be mixed or just to mix. This gives a great attractive power to the film for these children who will be panickstricken by the kidnapping and possible killing of Santa Claus, and who will be thrilled by the frightening characters that haunt our vision of Halloween and this strange night when ghosts come back to roam our streets begging for candy. A classic for children and a piece of artistic pleasure for adults.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Since this film was released ten years ago, it still garners acclaim the world over, and justifiably it should.  Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is a true feast for the senses, from the atmosphere to the state of the art stop motion animation, this film is pure joy from beginning to end.  The story revolves around Jack Skellington, the king of Halloweentown who soon tires of his day in, day out Halloween themed shenanigans.  When he stumbles upon Christmastown, he plans to bring his own version of Christmas to everyone by impersonating a kidnapped Santa Claus.  While the film is aimed at a young audience, teens and adults will eat up everything that is presented here.  And even though some of the film may be too macabre for it's own good towards young children, The Nightmare Before Christmas is still a rousing film that actually will satisfy the entire family.  This Special Edition DVD presents the film with a fantastic DTS track, and includes a number of extras including two short films from Tim Burton.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K94LXX833JTT.html">A1K94LXX833JTT</a><br/><p>Aaron has already pointed out the main announced difference between this Ultimate edition and the non-ultimate Collector's Edition, the numbered, hand-painted bust of Jack Skellington with his Sandy Claws hat and beard and a sound chip that plays quotes from the movie (with certificate of authenticity).  Amazon has since posted more details (above).  Looks like the bust will come in a special coffin-shaped box.  This edition will also have a booklet with the Nightmare Before Christmas poem, and an additional DVD for the digital copy.  Not sure what the advantage of the extra disc is.  It will cost you about an extra hundred bucks for those extras.  For that money, you may as well know about the movie and the other details of the set and the alternative new releases.<br /><br />The Nightmare Before Christmas is the kind of Christmas movie you might expect from Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands): macabre, sort-of-but-not-too-scary, and ultimately good-humored and good-natured.  It's also quite a feat of animation, the first feature-length stop-action film.  And it's a musical!<br /><br />The story takes place in a world where the magical side of each major holiday is run by a specialized, hidden holiday town, like Santa's North Pole headquarters.  One year, the restless Jack Skellington of Halloween Town discovers Christmas Town, is very impressed, and decides Halloween Town should expand its horizons and take over Christmas that year.  Unfortunately, he and the other residents of his town don't understand Christmas as well as they do Halloween, and their basically well-intentioned efforts threaten to ruin Christmas altogether.<br /><br />The animation is highly imaginative and particularly well suited to the Halloween connections, as we would expect from a Burton-produced project.  The songs, by Danny Elfman, are catchy and fun, partly because of twisted but good-hearted subject matter.  There are scares, adventures, a romance, lessons learned, and a good Christmassy outcome.  Most kids and adults will be delighted, though parents may wish to consider the scary stuff for very young kids who don't like being scared.<br /><br />The Nightmare Before Christmas is returning to DVD in three editions, all with newly restored and remastered transfers.  For standard definition, there will be the 2-disc Collector's Edition (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AIRUOU">here</a>) and this Ultimate Collector's Edition, which will have the same features except for those mentioned above.  This will be the first time the movie will be available in anamorphic widescreen.  There will also be new special features.<br /><br />There will be a Blu-ray edition with the same DVD special features plus an exclusive intro by Burton (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AIRUP4">here</a>).  There has been no announcement for a Blu-ray Ultimate edition with the bust, and I don't see a page for one here at Amazon.<br /><br />The new special features, shared by all the new new editions, are these:<br /><br />-- audio commentary with producer/writer Tim Burton, director Henry Selick and composer Danny Elfman (who also sings in the movie)<br />-- Burton's original "The Nightmare Before Christmas" poem read by legendary horror actor Christopher Lee<br />-- new intro by Burton for Frankenweenie (see below)<br />-- a digital copy of the movie<br />-- "What's This? Jack's Haunted Mansion Holiday Tour," a two-part promo for the Disneyland theme park attraction<br /><br />Features carried over from the 2000 Special Edition, shared by all the new editions:<br /><br />-- "The Making of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas" (about 25 minutes on the Special Edition)<br />-- "The Worlds of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas" (the worlds being Halloween Town, Christmas Town, and "The Real World")<br />-- deleted scenes (scenes that didn't get past the storyboards and cut animated scenes)<br />-- storyboard to film comparison<br />-- theatrical trailers and posters<br />-- Burton's early short stop-action film Vincent, about a boy who dreams of being Vincent Price, who narrates (5:50)<br />-- uncut version of Frankenweenie, Burton's early short live-action film wherein the basic events of Frankenstein are played out in suburban America, with a young boy in the place of Dr. Frankenstein and a pet dog in the place of the monster (29:50)<br /><br />There's no mention in the press release of the old commentary with Selick and director of photography Pete Kozachik, which went into detail about the technical aspects of the animation.  No mention either of the DTS 5.1 sound option included on the Special Edition.  The sound will be Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, aspect ratio 1.66:1 (original format).<br /><br />Looks like an excellent set.  The video and sound quality of the previous DVD was excellent, and Disney claims the new anamorphic version will be even better.</p></br><a href="../users/A10HMPPHWI3V0A.html">A10HMPPHWI3V0A</a><br/><p>I think this is my favorite Tim Burton film, up there with Edward Scissorhands, "A Nightmare Before Christmas" is one of the few movies that I can watch over and over again and never get bored with. It's a sad, adventourous and exciting take on the holidays of Halloween & Christmas and all their many wonders. The tale follows Jack the Pumpkin king who is the leader of Halloween town and all of it's citizens, they go to him to help create, each year, a better and more eventful as well as more scary halloween (kind of like Santa & Christmas).<br /><br />When Jack begins to feel that his reign as Pumpkin king is beggining to upset and bore him, he wonders off into a forrest where he comes about several trees with doors ingraved on them, each one with a different symbol that represents each of our holidays. When he stumbles about the christmas tree he gets very excited and is compelled to open the door and see what lies beyond it. What he finds is "Christmas Land" and after the quick but fun number "Whats This?" he loads up all of the intruiging contents of Christmas town and heads back towards halloween town where his curiousity compells him to try his own little christmas. He learns a lesson that he will never forget and soon re-takes his prideful position as pumpkin king.<br /><br />"The Nightmare Before Christmas" has a great origonal score along with some stand out songs. The effects of the movie are astounding and the voices of each charactor couldnt have been any better, its was a classic then and still remains just that<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A8M4WE1MT4R4O.html">A8M4WE1MT4R4O</a><br/><p>I absolutely love this movie.  It is on my top 10 of all time.  I love it so much i can't watch it all the time because i don't want to ruin it or wear it out.  It is a movie for adults actually.  They are the ones who can  truely appreciate it for what it is.  A genuine masterpiece of utter  perfection.  And the music?  What about the music?  It's really spooky and  cool!  <p>Watching Nightmare Before Christmas is like going on a really  cool ride at Disneyland.  It brings you into a fantastic world only equaled  while dreaming.  Thank you Tim Burton for creating this wonderful  movie!<p>Try watching the t.v show &quot;The P.Js&quot; if you like this  type of animation.</p></br><a href="../users/A168VXSISJWQN9.html">A168VXSISJWQN9</a><br/><p>Like many others, we have made this movie into a tradition. After the Halloween trick or treating is done, we settle down and watch TNBC. It creates a great transition between the two holidays.<br /><br />I think this is one of Danny Elfman's best movies. The Halloweentown songs are suitably creepy, but 'What's this?' has a very Christmassy feel of excitement. I love the use of color, too; appropriately gloomy for the Halloweentown sequences, but bright and cheerful for Christmastown. The story is original and the characters are memorable. There's a lot of humor, as you might expect, but some of the scenes might be frightening for younger children, so use some discretion as to what age you feel they can watch it without being too scared.<br /><br />A fun movie which repays watching over and over; there's always something new to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AK7ZFKW08HID.html">A2AK7ZFKW08HID</a><br/><p>This movie never gets old. We watch out every Halloween and Christmas. The kids enjoy it along with the adults. It is even better now that it is on blu ray. Can't wait to get it in 3D. Tim Burton has a phenomenal imagination! He never disappoints.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>I'm sure most of my friends are surprised that I've never seen this movie before, but you must remember that I've only owned a DVD player for about three and a half years [written in 2009], and almost never went to movies in theaters before that. I didn't know anything about Tim Burton until I discovered Johnny Depp, and I thought Depp was going to be the voice of Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King. But it's OK that he's not: it's still a very fun movie.<br /><br />The basic premise is that all the holidays come from their own towns, accessible through hollow trees that stand in a ring with symbols of the holidays involved on each one. One has a profile of a turkey, one a red heart, one a painted egg, another a pumpkin, and one a decorated tree. I think there were others, but I don't remember exactly. The narrator takes us through the pumpkin shaped door into the world of Halloween Town, which is supposed to be very scary and spooky, but is mostly funny, and perhaps would be gross if they weren't animations. The Mayor is a roly-poly character with two faces, one grinning and one menacing, who wears a badge saying "Mayor" and who says, "I'm only an elected official; I can't make decisions by myself." The real hero is Jack, the Pumpkin King. He's every bit as skinny as a skeleton except that he wears a black pin-striped suit.<br /><br />But Jack is bored of the same old thing every year, and goes wandering off to bemoan his fate, finally discovering the ring of trees with the doors to other holidays. He goes into the one for Christmas and is overwhelmed. It's wonderful! All bright lights and happy people, and he wants it for his own.<br /><br />Then there is Sally, Dr. Finkelstein's creation, a sweet blue girl who is his slave. She's all stitches, and can break off an arm or a leg as necessary, sewing it back when there's time. She's in love with Jack, and Finkelstein keeps her from him except for when she puts a sleeping potion in his food so she can get away.<br /><br />So when Jack comes back to Halloween Town to get everyone hyped up to make Christmas this year, he asks Sally to make a Santa Claus costume for him. He's misunderstood, and thinks it is Sandy Claws who is in charge of Christmas, and something frightening instead of beloved. When the Boogie's boys go and capture Santa Claus for him, he looks at him and declares, "Why you have hands! Where are your claws?"<br /><br />No, I'm not going to spoil it. Much of the fun is the music and the visual effects of the various characters in Halloween Town, and the gifts and toys they make for Christmas. But there is a plot (all puns intended), and the basic question is how can Halloween and Christmas get back to their proper spheres?<br /><br />Anyone over the age of 5 or 6 will probably love this one, right up to 95 or 96.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>For me Tim Burton had been an on & off success - he did an awful job with Planet of the Apes but really soared with Ed Wood.  So renting this movie was with some trepidation.<br /><br />But it's not so!  Henry Selick directed and Burton produced a great stop animation feature, something you don't see much of today, nor in 1993 when it was produced.  With a technical team that took three years to make, the film is really the sum of its parts.  Great film!<br /><br />The story is a simple one with a simple theme.  Jack, the Pumpkin King in Halloween-town has just pulled off another great Halloween complete with vampires that look like Nosferatu and a few horror icons from old films and weird wickedness!  But Jack is bored of the whole thing and wanders around and bumps into doors that lead to holidays - a big heart door for Valentines', an egg-shaped door for Easter.  What's this?  Christmas-town?<br /><br />After much analysis of what makes Christmas, Jack decides to make Christmas in his own Halloween-obsessed image to hilarious results.  A ragdoll girl, recently created, has a crush on Jack and tries to stop him before her premonition comes true and both holidays are lost.<br /><br />favorite scenes:  I like all the wild and crazy characters but especially the Boogey man who rolls those bones (literally) and takes Santa captive.  Another is the mayor of Halloween-town who has a spinning head - one with smiles and one with a fearful frown.  Could this be a metaphor for those who change faces when things don't go well?  Nah!<br /><br />Memorable themes by Danny Elfman!  And a great "making of" feature where we meet the director, producers and tech personnel and all the hard work they put into this film.  Quite impressive.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  I had heard a criticism on this film that children would confuse Christmas with Halloween, which is nonsense.  The film is light-hearted, makes fun of itself and has great themes of trying something new and if it doesn't work out, at least you tried!  Good work Tim.<br /><br />Other Animated Burton Products:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UAKE9Y">Coraline</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C3L27U">Tim Burton's Corpse Bride (Widescreen Edition)</a></p></br><a href="../users/AN8M401S8Y6DA.html">AN8M401S8Y6DA</a><br/><p>I was able to find the information online for this blu ray and figured I'd pass it along.

If you have a blu ray player and like the film I'd say it is worth it to double dip, with those colors popping off the screen at 1080p or hearing kidnap the sandy claws and Danny Elfman's score (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305216088">Good Will Hunting (Miramax Collector's Series)</a>) in the newer sound formats (if your lucky enough to have them).<br /><br />BLU RAY FEATURES (FROM MOVIEWEB)<br />You can watch a Tim Burton classic in 1080p for the first time this August.

The good news is that with the exception of a DTS soundtrack and director Henry Selick's solo commentary track, everything from the previous edition has been included in this one.<br /><br />Disc one includes a new audio commentary by producer Tim Burton, director Henry Selick, and music designer Danny Elfman. They were recorded separately and then edited together. Burton talks about the classic animated holiday TV specials that made a huge impression on him. Elfman claims that this is his favourite collaboration with Burton and talks about how he got involved. There is a significant amount of overlap from the numerous featurettes included on this set.<br /><br />A new extra is "What's This? Jack's Haunted Mansion Holiday Tour," which takes you through a haunted mansion ride based on the film. The attention to detail and decor is fantastic, done in Gothic fashion. You can also take the tour with a trivia subtitle track imparting all kinds of factoids. Also included is a featurette examining how they added the Nightmare Before Christmas style to the classic Haunted Mansion design.<br /><br />Also new is "Tim Burton's Original Poem," narrated by none other than veteran genre actor Christopher Lee. This provided the original inspiration for the film. Lee's great voice narrates over evocative concept art.<br /><br />"The Making of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas" takes us through various stages of the production, including the music, storyboards, art direction, and animation. It provides a detailed look at all of the work that went into creating the film and the challenges of stop motion animation.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with "Frankenweenie," a short film Burton directed in 1984. He offers a new introduction and mentions that work has begun on a feature-length stop motion animated film. Shot in gorgeous black and white, it's about a young boy named Vincent (Barret Oliver) who decides to resurrect his dead dog Sparky a la Dr. Frankenstein. Shelley Duvall and Daniel Stern play his very Leave It To Beaver-esque parents.<br /><br />"Vincent" is an animated short film that Burton made early in his career about a young boy who idolizes Vincent Price, who, incidentally, narrates the story. It has a wonderful, Expressionistic look reminiscent of early silent horror films.<br /><br />Also included are three deleted storyboards and four animated sequences introduced by Selick. They feature sequences that didn't make the final cut, some were never animated. Selick explains that they were cut for reasons of time and pacing.<br /><br />"The World's of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas" explores the characters that inhabit Christmas Town, Halloween Town, and the Real World with all sorts of character designs, animation tests and concept art. It allows you to see the various incarnations of these beloved characters.<br /><br />"Storyboards-to-Film Comparison" takes a look at a scene from the film and allows you to watch it simultaneously with the corresponding storyboards.<br /><br />Finally, there are "Posters and Trailers," a collection of poster art, a teaser trailer and a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you own the previous Special Edition, it's not really worth the double dip unless you really a devoted fan of this film. If this is your first time purchasing this film on DVD, then get Collector's Edition which has everything you could possibly want.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>With the advent of video/DVD, certain movies lend themselves to annual viewing during specific holiday seasons, especially Halloween (It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"), Thanksgiving ("Home for the Holidays"), and of course, The Big One, Christmas (Insert your own favorites here); specific films that for whatever reason manifest the spirit of their respective times of the year, and they generally match up one season per film.  Filmmaker Tim Burton, however, has the distinction of having created a singular film to add to this category, unique in that it is suited equally to both Halloween AND Christmas.  And it tops the entire list of the titles of which that can be said; in fact, it IS the list-- there simply are no others.  Burton's brainchild, which had a gestation period of many years before at last being realized in 1993 is, indeed, in a category of it's own.  It is, of course, "The Nightmare Before Christmas," directed by Henry Selick.<p> Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon), the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, can put the scare on like no one else.  But after years of doing what he does best-- scaring the wits out of children of all ages, everywhere, every Halloween-- he's bored; depressed, even.  There's just no "rush" in it for him anymore.  So, after a particularly unfulfilling Allhallow's Eve, Jack wanders off alone into the night to contemplate his circumstance and his future, whereupon he inadvertently stumbles into "Christmas Town," and discovers something new ("What's this?  What's this!")-- a different holiday, as well as the celebration that accompanies it.  Most importantly, though, he also discovers his counterpart, the one who is to this holiday what he is to Halloween.  "And they call... him... San-Dee CLAWS!"  And Jack, his eyes and ears filled with the sights and sounds of Christmas, is more excited than he's been in a long, long while.  He doesn't know, yet, what all of this is about, but he's going to find out; and he's already made up his mind:  Whatever it is, it's going to be his!  Sandee Claws, step aside-- Jack Skellington is here!<p> Through the magic of stop-motion animation, Burton's vision-- his story and the characters who populate his "nightmare"-- comes vividly to life, the process of which is guided along nicely by director Selick.  And what a bunch of characters there are!  Besides Jack (who is, without question, the star of the show), there is the two-faced (literally) Mayor (Glenn Shadix); Dr. Finklestein (wonderfully voiced by William Hickey); Lock, Shock and Barrel (Paul Reubens, Catherine O'Hara, Danny Elfman), the unholy trio who work for the dreadful Mr. Oogie Boogie (Ken Page); and, last but not least, gentle and compassionate Sally (Catherine O'Hara), who cares for Jack and so badly wants to help him find whatever it is he's looking for.  Intriguing characters for a highly original story, imaginatively drawn and presented with care and an expertise that really makes this one work.<p> Another element that sells it is the engaging score and original songs by Danny Elfman (who also supplies Jack's singing voice).  And Selick uses the music wisely to create an appropriate atmosphere and mood conducive to the storyline.  The songs, especially, are haunting, hypnotic, upbeat and theatrical, and combined with the magic of the splendid visual content, helps set the tone for a rich and thoroughly entertaining experience.<p> The supporting cast includes (the voices of) Ed Ivory (Santa), Susan McBride (Big Witch), Debi Durst (Corpse Kid/Corpse Mother/Small Witch), Greg Proops (Harlequin Demon/Devil/Sax Player), Kerry Katz (Man Under Stairs/Vampire/Corpse Father), Randy Crenshaw (Mr. Hyde/Behemoth/Vampire), Sherwood Ball (Mummy/ Vampire), Carmen Twillie (Undersea Gal/Man Under the Stairs) and Glenn Waters (Wolfman).  There's a decidedly dark side to this film that may be disturbing to younger viewers, but for those to whom the monster-in-the-closet no longer appears, "The Nightmare Before Christmas" is good for TWO of your favorite holidays (or actually, for any time of the year, for that matter).  Unique, to say the least, this is a fun foray into fantasy that can be enjoyed time and again.  The story, the characters, the images, the songs; it's all magic.  It is, in fact, the magic of the movies.  Tim Burton style.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>I have seen this movie several times and I never get tired of it. It gives a really funky look into the world of holidays, with a separate universe for each holiday that is connected to the real world. One day, Jack Skellington becomes curious about the other worlds, and goes from the Halloween world to the world of Christmas, where he is intrigued by it because it is so different from his own, so he wants to celebrate Christmas in the mortal world. This brings about disastrous consequences because he does not quite understand Christmas, and the other residents of the Halloween world understand it even less. The results are scary and hilarious, and this is a classic movie that never gets old.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is one of those wonderfully atmospheric films that has easily stood the test of time. It is as delightful and quirky now as when it was initially released. The stop-motion animation is superb and the dark Tim Burton Characters are perfect for the story. Danny Elfman provided the music and songs for this film and they stick in your head at first listen and you can't help but grin and sing along with subsequent viewings. The story is unique and fun and although it has a very dark turn to it, it is still fine viewing for children, although I tend to feel adults may appreciate it more. This is one film I watch annually (yes, at Christmas time!) as a matter of tradition now and I love it every time. A modern classic, and rightly so, and if you haven't seen this film you're missing out on a rare treat. Snap it up quick and enter it's weird and wonderful world.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LXG7XUQNZO6E.html">A2LXG7XUQNZO6E</a><br/><p>To insist that The Nightmare Before Christmas is an animation classic is an understatement but I'd also like to go one step further and state that I believe it also to be a holiday classic that works just as well on Christmas as it does on Halloween, at least, for me and my family it does! We watch this film every X-mas alongside such classics as The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, A Christmas Story and Black Christmas...well...I usually end up watching the last one alone. Anyhow...The Nightmare Before Christmas is an animation classic suitable for ALMOST all ages and definitely all seasons; it's endearing, intelligent and cuter than a pile of bunny bodies.<br /><br />If you've never seen The Nightmare Before Christmas, I know some of you haven't, than what are you waiting for? This features top-of-the-line stop-motion animation, humorous and heartwarming songs, lovable characters and a world of dark imagination just waiting to keep you and your family company. In my opinion Tim Burton is a cinematic genius, a macabre artiste with unlimited creativity and style and this film certainly embodies all of that and much more. If you haven't taken the time to see this film, you're simply missing out on an amazingly entertaining experience, one that demands to be enjoyed year after year, holiday after holiday.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EISFBTLEQC69.html">A3EISFBTLEQC69</a><br/><p>Nightmare before Christmas is sooo fantastic.

This year, however, he's not feeling it. After wandering the forest, he discovers a doorway to Christmasland and, falling in love with the warmth and love there, is determined to bring Christmas to his friends - by kidnapping Santa/Sandy Claus (Ivory). The new version isn't a director's cut: there's no scenes shaved or added, but the 3D makeover adds more depth and gives a wider scope to Burton's bizarre gothic world. It's also a good excuse to fork over a tenner for a re-release. The animation is short (really short), which means it doesn't outstay its welcome or leave you with a headache (it can be a lot on the eyes at times) and you'll get to keep a cheap pair of '80s style shades to boot!</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>It was the Nightmare before Christmas & all through the towns people will go to see Tim Burton's frightningly holly jolly triumph in 3D, the characters you love, the songs you love, the frights & seasons greetings you love as Walt Disney Pictures welcomes back Jack Skellington, Sally, Mayor, Ooogie Boogie, Sandy Claus & Zero.

The 3D does work very well by way of adding depth to the film, it's like you're watching through a window, though this feature is more like a value added bonus, it doesn't really add anything to the film itself because the film was not originally intended to be a 3D film.

We've all been accustomed to seeing Christmas music on display well before Halloween has come and gone.  This idea was given full reign in `<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019KAQEU">It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown</a>,' with the late Charles M. Schultz's wonderful take on Halloween when Linus gets mixed up between Santa Claus and the famous, fictitious legend who delivers toys on Halloween night.  This is where Tim Burton's `The Nightmare Before Christmas' takes off, but from there all parallels stop, and flair takes the helm for this truly unique animated adventure.<br /><br />The story is uncomplicated enough.  Jack Skellington (Danny Elfman), an emaciated man who is charming in character and sinister in appearance, is the figure head of Halloweentown, and the key figure of the most anticipated holiday of the village.  November 1st as one might expect, is a let-down, and a down-cast Jack finds himself wandering through a forest all night long.<br /><br />At the end of his journey, he discovers the North Pole and all the inhabitants surrounding Christmas's festive figure, Santa Claus.  Noting that there is something different abound, he goes back to Halloween Town and brings all he sees back to the people.  Feeling inadequate to convey the warmth of the season, he plots with three mischievous children to kidnap Ole Saint Nick and have the secrets of gift giving unfold for his town.<br /><br />Embellishing the story are some offbeat characters.  Ragdoll Sally (Catherine O'Hara) is captive to the nasty Dr. Finkelstein (William Hickey) in a Rapunzel-like subplot.<br /><br />`The Nightmare Before Christmas' could have been a one note wonder, but what I like about it is the charm factor.  In the midst of a cute and macabre background (I'd never thought that would mix until seeing this film.), delightful songs and memorable characters fill the screen.  It doesn't exactly come off like Lucille Ball singing "We Need a Little Christmas," but the sojourn from a dark world yearning to be lighter is worth taking indeed.<br /><br />A J.P.'s Pick 5 *'s =Exceptional<br /><br />Happy Halloween! ;>)</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of the few truly visionary motion pictures of the last couple of decades.  The bizarre story is one only Tim Burton could tell, and he brings that story to life with some of the most impressive animation I've ever seen.  Stop-motion animation requires infinite care and patience to create, and one could easily forgive any slight hitches that result - but you'll find no imperfections at all here, as the animation rolls along beautifully and naturally.  As for the story, I found it good but not great, but the dark and imaginative vision behind it all more than makes up for any flaws in the writing.<br /><br />Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown, has grown bored of all the scary shenanigans to which his land is dedicated to producing, finding little joy in topping his past accomplishments each year.  Wandering off alone, lost in thought, he happens to come across a sort of holiday crossroads, which leads him to Christmas Town.  It's a world like nothing he's ever seen before, and the Christmas magic quickly captures his heart and soul - so much that he returns home to refashion Halloweentown in the guise of Christmas Town.  He has a hard time communicating the spirit of Christmas to the townsfolk, but his perseverance pays off in the transition of the local industry from scary items to Christmas toys and gifts (unfortunately, gifts such as shrunken heads aren't exactly what little Johnny or his parents are particularly looking for).  As Christmas approaches, Jack prepares to don the red suit and white beard, hook up his remodeled coffin sleigh to the reindeer created by the local mad scientist, and sail off into the night to deliver toys to all the good little boys and girls - after he has the real Santa Claus kidnapped, of course.  Only Sally, a rag doll who loves Jack from afar, sees just what a disaster this is in the making.  With Santa suffering torture at the hands of the Bogeyman, it looks like Christmas is doomed for sure.<br /><br />I don't see this as a children's movie, although children will no doubt be delighted by all of the dark and wacky animation.  I also found the somewhat rushed ending somewhat ambiguous, especially in terms of Jack's feelings for good old Halloween.  Still, the film does evoke the Christmas spirit somewhat and certainly proves entertaining with its wonderful soundtrack, incredible animation, and dark humor.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>In the world of Halloween in a special town called HalloweenTown, the Pumpkin king named Jack Skeleton (Voiced by Chris Sarandon and sung by Danny Elfman) has grown tired of the same old thing year after year.

In his explorations he discovers an opening into a Christmas town where life exists with lights, presents and gaiety. Because of the theory that the grass is always greener on the other side our sad Jack feels the need to possess Santa and bring him back to his own dark Halloweentown while Jack becomes the new Santa. The story is great and a darkly humorous slap in the face of our over commercialized Christmas holiday. Along with Jack a cast of interesting characters exist in Halloweentown: Dr. Finklestein (a silly duck like version of Frankenstein), Sally (a lightly sewn together lady who needs a lot of stitches), Mayor (a two faced fatso with constant anxiety), and many others just as entertaining.<br /><br />This film would not be complete had it not been for Danny Elfman's musical score. The background music is really beautiful along the lines of a fairy tale with twists of horror laced in between. The lyrics for the songs are brilliantly poetic in a Halloweentown type of way and you may even find yourself humming a few for days afterwards.

As part of the plan, Santa is kidnapped, and the evil Oogie Boogie takes advantage of the situation to attempt a take-over of Halloweentown for himself.<br /><br />This is a very amusing story told through the vanishing art of stop-motion animation.  The visuals are eye-popping, and I fervently hope that director Henry Selick and others will keep the form alive in the face of the onslaught of computer animation.  Danny Elfman's music is enchantingly sweet and catchy, but always a bit creepy and off-kilter as well--perfect for the material.

Halloween has just ended in his hometown of Halloween Town, and he has been receiving kudos from everyone in town for making this year's Halloween the scariest ever. But Jack is seeking purpose in his life, and scaring people to death once a year just isn't doing it for him anymore. He takes a walk in the woods and he discovers a group of trees each with doors and different symbols on each door. He opens the door with the tree symbol on it, and finds himself in Christmas Town. While there, he is fascinated by the contrast of Christmas Town with his own world. Jack returns home, along with a sampling of trinkets from Christmas Town, to contemplate the meaning of what he has found there. Ultimately he decides that this year, Halloween Town is going to take charge of Christmas. Jack has also decided that he will replace "Sandy Claws" on his yearly sleigh ride, delivering presents to all of the children of the world. All of the citizens of Halloween Town are enthused by the idea except Sally, a creation of Halloween Town's mad scientist, who coincidentally is also looking for something new in her life. She alone sees the danger of Halloween Town hijacking the Christmas holiday.<br /><br />While the Grinch tried to destroy Christmas and came away with a true understanding of the meaning of the holiday, Jack Skellington, with the best of intentions, ruins Christmas but never figures out where he went wrong. In preparation for the big event, he enlists the townspeople to help make toys, and they just can't get the hang of making or doing anything that is not designed to terrify. In fact, when Jack makes his Christmas ride and the town hears on the radio of the terror Jack is causing, they actually see this as a sign of success. To them, horror equals happiness.<br /><br />Like most good films designed for all age groups, the movie is actually weaving a tale on two levels. The story itself is very straightforward so that children can easily follow it. On a second level, there is deft humor and one-liners that are obviously aimed at adults, such as the mayor's plea to Jack -"I'm only an elected official here!  I can't make decisions!" Or when the scientist who created Sally gets tired of her running away and builds a new creation to replace her. This one turns out to be just a female version of the mad scientist himself to which he has endowed half of his own brain. His conclusion is "You will be a decided improvement over that treacherous Sally. We'll have conversations worth having."<br /><br />Besides being clever and funny, this film is visually intriguing. All of the figures move smoothly and naturally, and the attention to detail is exquisite. The process of making this film required what was then (pre-1993) state-of-the-art computer-controlled camera movement for this feature film's stop-motion animation. Puppets built of a foam latex material covering intricate metal armatures were manipulated frame-by-frame on real miniature sets. The painstaking process took nearly three years to complete, with dozens of animators and crew members averaging only 60 seconds of film per week, because each different pose or position equaled only a 24th of a second of film time.<br /><br />You'll see quite a bit of similarity between the style of art design here and that done in some of Tim Burton's other films, such as "Beetlejuice". You'll also probably recognize Danny Elfman's style of score that has come to decorate so many of Burton's other films. I highly recommend this film as great entertainment for the whole family.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRZV63X79YSJ.html">A2XRZV63X79YSJ</a><br/><p>Everyone thinks that this is a Tim Burton film but he did not direct it.

Jack Skellington (Sarandon & Elfman), organizer of the festivities has got the blues.  He wants something different in his life, and while wandering in the forest, he finds a door to Christmas Town.  In Christmas Town, things are bright and cheerful.  It captures his interest, and when he returns to Halloween Town, he announces that this year, they will celebrate Christmas.  In fact, Jack will even replace "Sandy Claws" on Christmas to help spread the cheer.  He has it all planned out, but Salle (O'Hara) has a premonition that things will go terribly wrong.<br /><br />"Nightmare" has developed a following since it's initial release in 1993.  The stop-motion animation as well as the melding of Halloween and Christmas has captivated many, and Disney's decision to release it in 3-D is a welcome event for those people.  I think even a regular re-release would drum up some excitement.  The animation is top notch, and the story idea is an interesting one, but for me the execution of the story falls a little flat.  That being said, "Nightmare" is still worth seeing, especially in 3-D.</p></br><a href="../users/ADB8XCKNSDY5Z.html">ADB8XCKNSDY5Z</a><br/><p>I have mixed feelings about this movie.  The premise is wonderful, the character designs are spectacular, and the animation is beyond marvelous.  But it feels like some of the movie is missing.  It's almost as if the first 30 minutes of the movie was cut out.  The plot is rushed into before the characters have time to develop so there's no chemistry in Jack's romance, which looks like it was practically tossed in at the end.  Maybe if some of the songs were removed there could have been more room for development.  Or perhaps the film could have been made longer (something I almost NEVER recommend but would be okay with here).  The Danny Elfman soundtrack is terrific of course, but it's tough trying to develop character and plot through music alone, especially in a film that's only an hour and sixteen minutes.  I think the attempt to make this into somewhat of a musical was just too ambitious.  I wouldn't rank this as high up as Pee-Wee's Big Adventure or Big Fish where a lot more goes into the development of the protagonist.<br /><br />I still can't believe this movie came out way back in 1993.  Amazing.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>If you are a goth or emo kid, I'm sure you've seen this hundreds of times! But, I'm not here to bash goth kids, I'm here to review this film. It's a pretty good movie. I don't love it, but I like it. I do love the 'This is HALLOWEEN' song, and the revamped version done by Marilyn Manson. It's awesome that they combine HALLOWEEN and Christmas. In case you are new to the world of Tim Burton's depressing gothic/emo films, I'll give a brief synopsis; Jack Skellington is the King of HALLOWEEN Town, and he is getting tired of it. After the HALLOWEEN bash, he accidentally stumbles into Christmas Town and wants to bring it all back to his world. The creatures of HALLOWEEN Town begin to help Jack with his dream. Will Jack's dream go the way he plans? Can he save Santa Claus from Oogie Boogie. If you are a goth/emo kid, love HALLOWEEN, and Christmas, you'll love THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king, is the Halloween planner for Halloweentown and after another successfully Halloween that was scarier that ever he drifts off in melancholy.  Jack seems to have found himself in a brainy predicament as he tries to find reason in what he does and why he exists.  In contemplation Jack stumbles through a deep forest until he discovers an opening in the woods where there are a number of secret doors that lead to all the different holidays.  Jack decides to peek behind the door with the Christmas tree, but a strong wind pulls him in and he falls into a Christmas Town.  Flabbergasted Jack learns about this new and strange holiday as he is amazed about the peculiar traditions of Christmas Town and its leader, Santa Claus.  As Jack returns to Halloweentown he informs the citizens about Christmas Town and its scary leader, which leads him to want to give the people a Halloween styled Christmas, but there seems to be some dangers to this undertaking. <p>Nightmare Before Christmas is a wonderful story written by Tim Burton where misinterpretations and errors lead to admirable traits such as courage, forgiveness, and love.  However, the story is told in a macabre environment where characteristics are most often forgotten.  Despite the ghoulish atmosphere there is always a need for love and affection, and this punches through the true need for these traits.  Henry Selick does a very good job as he directs this puppet feature as it offers many thoughts and ideas for an audience to ponder, which leaves them with a very good cinematic experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A25PM9JGHPU8EI.html">A25PM9JGHPU8EI</a><br/><p>A technical matter - this was filmed @ 1.66:1, meaning that when you play it back on your HD widescreen it is going to show as a box with black borders all around it. If it were properly handled, an anamorphic transfer would blow the image to fill most of the screen except for small black vertical bars along the sides of the screen. If you play this back on a standard 4:3 television it won't matter - it will look just fine. Aside from that, the dvd has an excellent collection of materials. Luckily, I own the HUGE deluxe CAV LaserDisc boxed special edition and it looks like they managed to port all of it to dvd (except for the companion book by Frank Thompson). You could spend weeks admiring this film, frame-by-frame, so meticulous in detail. Elfman's great songs match very well with the story and perfect animation.</p></br><a href="../users/A38ZTUNQJVGP6S.html">A38ZTUNQJVGP6S</a><br/><p>The Nightmare Before Christmas is one hour and sixteen minutes and was released in theaters on October 15, 1993. The movie was initially to be released through Disney Studios, but the powers that be though that Nightmare was and I quote "too dark and scary for kids". Jack Skellington, The Pumpkin King, has just finished another Halloween and is depressed because it is the same old scare year after year; though the residents of Halloween Town enjoy it very much. Jack is looking for that something in his life and goes wondering off into the woods and find the holiday trees of Valentine Day, Easter, Saint Patrick Day, Thanksgiving, Halloween and Christmas. Each tree is a portal to that town and he accidently opens the Christmas Tree's portal door and gets sucked into Christmas Town. Jack is amazed at what he sees in Christmas Town; Christmas Town is the exact opposite of Halloween Town. In Christmas Town everybody is happy, building toys, and the smell of pie is everywhere. When Jack comes back to Halloween town and calls a town meeting, he tries to explain Christmas to the resident but the residents just cannot grasp it.<br /><br />Jack heads home and stays lock up in his lab trying to use a scientific approach to understand Christmas as well as performing experiments. Finally Jack is able to solve the problem about Christmas and announce to the residents of Halloween Town, who are witches, ghosts, vampires, zombies and bunch of other scary residents, that Christmas is ours this year. The only thing wrong with this picture is that the people who live in Halloween Town have live a life of scaring, doing creepy things, and being evil. They are unable to grasp the goodness of Christmas, but they do their best to try. The sleigh that Jack drives is coffin shaped and is pulled\flown by three skeleton reindeers; just to give you and example. Jack sends Lock, Shock and Barrel to snatch Santa Claus and bring him to Halloween Town. The three are able to find Santa Claus and hand him over to Oogie Boogie who begins to taunt him. Meanwhile Jack, along with his ghost dog Zero, flies off into the night sky with his bag of scary toys to hand out to the children of the world.<br /><br />Jack plans backfires when the parents inform the police of the phony Santa Clause and Jack's sleigh and reindeers are shot down from the sky. Jack realizes what he has done and head back to Halloween Town to rescue Santa Clause and set everything straight. Jack discovers that Santa Claus is held captive by Oogie Boogie and that Oogie Boogie is about to kill Santa Claus and Sally. Jack is able to rescue Santa Clause and Sally and defeats Oogie Boogie. In the end Santa Claus is able to restore Christmas and out the end of the movie it begins to snow and the residents begin to sing their version of What's This. Not since Mad Monster Party came out in 1967 has there been a stop motion picture been made; though I could be wrong. The Nightmare Before Christmas gets an AAAAA+++++.<br /><br />DVD EXTRAS<br /><br />Chapter Selections<br />Set Up<br />A. Spoken Languages<br />B. Captions and Subtitles<br />C.

Nothing wrong here, just a classic that'll reign for ages.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>... Tim Burton is now a favorite of mine. There is also a great making of and the deleted footages are so fun. Many more extra's also such as an art gallery with over 400 stills, and of course the commentary which I never bother to listen to on any DVD. Now the movie itself is brillaint. The animation is superb and the plot is just amazing. My only complaint being that at many points the film is lacking and just moves so slow, hence the missing star. Dont get me wrong, it is an enjoyable film and definitely one I watch over and over, but many scenes have some drab and boring music, that Im not sure of kids will enjoy. But the film is amazing and that is just one flaw. Its a must.

I have recently converted to Blu-ray, so I am still basking in the glow of the clarity of this new format, so bear with me! Inspired by the classic Rankin-Bass stop-motion animation Christmas classics & "The Grinch Who Stole Christmas," Tim Burton's film tells the tale of Jack Skellington, a kind mis-guided soul who falls in love with Christmas, and attempts to put his own Halloween spin on it, wreaking havoc when the two holidays collide. The characters are memorable: Sally (a Bride-of-Frankenstein-type rag doll who attempts to escape her maker, the twisted Dr. Finklestein), Jack's ghostly pet dog, Zero, the evil Oogie Boogie (a green sack-like boogie-man addicted to gambling), the Mayor of Halloween Town (who actually has two faces that spin around according to his mood and what he wants to show the town!), and Lock, Shock, & Barrel (mischievous trick-or-treaters who kidnap Santa!). The emotion that is able to be achieved by Burton's crew through the puppets is nothing short of astounding, and Burton's Germanic-stylized sets are a visual feast.<br /><br />Bonus features include:<br /><br />New!

Tim Burton can certainly come up with all the visual elements in a film, but he lacks in his story telling sometimes. The music in this film is mediocre at best and is one of it's biggest flaws. Please don't get me wrong, I love this movie, but it is not one of the greatest movie ever made as many have claimed. The music is boring and drags sometimes especially if you copmpare it to 'James and the Giant Peach' where the songs are very good and drive the film. "James" is much more entertaining on a story level too. 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is a beautiful looking film and has great characters, it also has fantastic animation and who doesn't love monsters?, but it just doesn't quite live up to the cult status it has achieved.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>Long had I dreaded the day when I would be forced to sit down and watch "The Nightmare Before Christmas".  Not because I thought it would be horrible - in fact, I expected it to be quite good.  I've always loved Tim Burton, and the premise sounded great.  So this Christmas, when my brother received it for a Christmas present, I finally sat myself down and watched it.<br /><br />The storyline is great: Jack Skellington, Halloweentown's spookiest spook, is getting sick of Halloween.  One day, he stumbles across a door which leads him into Christmastown - and immediately, Jack is entranced by this jolly world in which all is good all the time.  And so Jack decides to bring Christmas to Halloweentown.<br /><br />I can sum up my thoughts about the film in two sentences, as sang by the fabulous Danny Elfman: "What's this?  What's this?"  This film is always rated very highly, but I found it to be extremely bizarre, creepy, and even a little repulsive.  I wouldn't dream of showing it to my kids, with the eerie creatures and lines such as "Kidnap Santa, chop him into bits".  The animation was fantastic, but I thought the rest of the film was weak.  There is, however, one great song, "What's This?".<br /><br />While I can understand people enjoying this film, I just couldn't.  It's too bizarre, grim, and perhaps even grotesque for my tastes.  I suppose you'll just have to try it for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Only Tim Burton could produce a holiday musical about Halloween's grotesqueries taking over Christmas.<br /><br />And in fact he did. Burton wrote and produced a charming stop-motion musical called "The Nightmare Before Christmas," which is as close as we'll ever get to a Burton Christmas film. And there's rarely a dull moment in this town called Halloween -- from start to finish, it's a quirky, macabre, vintage-flavoured ride through the darker side of everybody's favorite holidays.<br /><br />In Halloween Town, the undead Jack Skellington is king, and each Halloween the residents try to make their celebration even more horrible than the year before.<br /><br />But this year, something is missing for Jack, and he starts wondering if scaring people is all his life has. He ends up wandering into a sort of holiday junction, and finds a portal to Christmas Town -- it's full of snow, lights, presents and innocent fun. Jack is instantly enamoured of Christmas, and decides that for this year, the residents of Halloween Town are going to celebrate Christmas.<br /><br />He manages to convince the other Halloween residents -- except the sweet rag-doll Sally -- to go along with his plan. So Halloween Town is redecorated and filled with presents (in a suitably ghastly style) and "Sandy Claws" is abducted so Jack can take his place. But are the people of Halloween Town just not suited to innocent merriment, and can the Pumpkin King fill the capacious red suit when Christmas Eve rolls around?<br /><br />The idea of Halloween ghouls and spooks deciding to take over Christmas sounds terribly twee in concept, like a gimmicky children's book. Fortunately Tim Burton's darkly humorous sense of humor and delightfully gothic designs -- as well as Henry Selick's brilliant direction -- end up turning the movie into something that is more than just another kid's movie. Think a Burtonesque "Princess Bride."<br /><br />Much of its charm comes from the richness of Burton's visuals -- his Halloween Town is saturated in spiky iron fences, ghost dogs, insects, mad scientists, and a spooky cloudy night that never ends. And though the inhabitants of Halloween Town are devoted to being grotesque and spooky, there's a lighthearted benevolence in their actions at all times. It almost makes Christmas Town look... dull.<br /><br />But it's also an incredibly funny, sweet little movie, with plenty of heart. There's an adorable little love story between Jack and Sally ("My dearest friend, if you don't mind..."), despite Jack's total cluelessness. And Burton weaves in lots of solid musical numbers ("There's children throwing snowballs/instead of throwing heads/they're busy building toys/and absolutely no one's dead!").<br /><br />But the crown jewel is Burton's macabre sense of humor. Hardly a scene goes by without a creepy gag (one child's present is a shrunken head) or clever dialogue ("Jack, please, I'm only an elected official here. I can't make decisions by myself!"). But the best humor comes from the Halloween-town's residents eagerly trying to be festive, and only making Christmas even creepier than Halloween ever could be.<br /><br />For a skeleton puppet, Jack Skellington is a pretty adorable hero -- he's earnest, generous, but suffers from a bit of ennui from the same old performance every year. His meditative songs about Halloween and his attempts at Christmas add an introspective note to him as well. And he's backed by a bunch of lovable characters, with Sally and the ghost dog Zero at the forefront.<br /><br />"Nightmare Before Christmas" is a macabre, wildly adorable little movie that reminds us why we love Halloween (besides the candy). Sometimes the dark and fun go hand in hand.</p></br><a href="../users/A1T3O2LILVK0C4.html">A1T3O2LILVK0C4</a><br/><p>What happens when you mix a strange combination of Walt Disney Studios and Tim Burton, Christmas and Halloween, horror and romance, tragedy and comedy? The result is a stop-motion animated musical that's become a cult classic for the whole family.<br /><br />Jack Skellington is the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town. He's altogether fearsome and empathetic, monstrous and charming, and basically a good guy (even if a little over ambitious). But he's become disenchanted with his routine life. Every year he leads the other creepy citizens of his town in a Halloween scare fest, but what's there to do the other 364 days of the year? Jack finds out when he and his ghost-dog, Zero accidentally come across a forest where upon each tree there's a door representing every holiday. Jack stumbles through one of the doors and finds himself in Christmas Town. After learning a bit about Christmas, Jack becomes obsessed with replicating it in his own delightfully twisted way. He enlists the help of Lock, Shock and Barrel, the town's local juvenile gang, to kidnap Santa Claus so that Jack can take over Christmas for that year. But all goes awry when the sinister Oogie Boogie plots against Jack. He plans to take control of Halloween Town while Jack is out playing "Sandy Claws". Meanwhile in our world Jack's presents turn out to be disastrous, mainly because they consist of toys like dead ducks on strings, disembodied heads and demonic stuffed animals. Soon the military is called in to shoot down Jack's sleigh along with his skeletal reindeer. Can Jack's friends save him in time? His greatest allies include a vampire trio, the literally two-faced Mayor, and Sally, a reanimated corpse who's fallen desperately in love with Jack.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that this year marks the 15th anniversary of the perennial holiday favorite. It's also interesting to note that many of Tim Burton's fans consider this to be his best film, which is ironic because he didn't actually direct it. Henry Selick is the director, though Burton's signature style is all over this film. It looks like Edward Gorey's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0151003084">The Gashlycrumb Tinies</a> book meets an Edvard Munch painting. The humor is reminiscent of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002CX1LG">The Munsters</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEZEYG">The Addams Family</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HA4WDY">Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas!</a>, and Burton's own <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004U8P8">Edward Scissorhands</a>. The film even reminds me of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ADS63K">The Wizard of Oz</a>. It has important moral messages about not judging people on their appearance, accepting your own individuality and the true meaning of Christmas (generosity, sacrifice and unconditional love).<br /><br />The new 2-disc edition is loaded with special features including:<br />an audio commentary track, a digital copy of the film, the short film Vincent, the short film Frankenweenie, Christopher Lee's recital of Tim Burton's poem which inspired the film, and numerous documentaries and featurettes about the making of the film.<br /><br />I also recommend the superb <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IFRQHC">Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas</a> soundtrack which features the original voice cast performing all of your favorite songs as well as new narration by Patrick Stewart. Also included is a second disc that contains contemporary artists performing covers of their favorite Nightmare Before Christmas songs. It's the only album released under the Disney banner to feature Marilyn Manson and songs about kidnapping and torturing Santa Claus, which alone makes this a must-have.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Produced by Tim Burton (who also co-wrote the story), Henry Selick's Gothic holiday fantasy blends state-of-the-art stop-motion animation with an imaginative, light-heartedly eerie story about a clever spook who decides to reinvent Christmas. Along the way, the jack-o-lantern-headed Jack (amiably voiced by Chris Sarandon) has to square off against his evil nemesis, Oogie Boogie (Ken Page), who has sinister plans of his own. With Danny Elfman's frightfully jolly score and a bright script based on characters Burton created, this is a "Nightmare" the whole family will enjoy (though smaller fry might get spooked at times).</p></br><a href="../users/A2MQQI4UYT9C11.html">A2MQQI4UYT9C11</a><br/><p>Not quite a "one-of-a-kind" movie any more (James and the Giant Peach and Corpse Bride used the same stop-action technology), but still in a class by itself, "The Nightmare Before Christmas" is both my favorite Christmas movie, and my favorite movie from among my daughter's collection (though "Toy Story" is right there to this child of the early '60s).  The brilliant character of Jack Skellington, "The Pumpkin King", and Danny Elfman's amazing score and songs carry the show, but there are plenty of other high(low?)lights among the dozens of ghoulish characters and scenes--the two-faced mayor, the Strangelovian mad scientist, the minor-key string quartet...too many to list.  Catherine O'Hara's poignant voicing of the Jack's cautious admirer, Sally, adds a heartfelt touch to what overall is a pretty strange tale--the hijacking of Christmas and kidnapping of Santa Claus by the denizens of Halloween.  My daughter loved this movie too (though she was just born when it came out), but I think I loved it best then and now.  "Look, Zero--they're thanking us!" Five enthusiastic stars!</p></br><a href="../users/A2EUG9W2IAVCT.html">A2EUG9W2IAVCT</a><br/><p>This is one of the top movies in my all time favorites list and for good reason.  It came out two years before I even reached age 10 but I remember seeing and it being fascinated in a chilled sense.  The Nightmare Before Christmas is a humorous (and somewhat dark) take on the classic Christmas tale--eventually becoming a classic itself.  The first movie to be made in stop motion features memorable characters, brilliant music and great talent.  Parents concerned if The Nightmare Before Christmas is too dark for some of their children should put those feelings to rest; it's a movie and an entertaining one at that.  Like most adventure-influenced children's movies this has its good characters and scary ones.  But it's still fun and shouldn't freak one's kids out at all.  Overall The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of those films that is both fun and brilliant.  It's classic!</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>Tim Burton (Big Fish, Edward Scissorhands, Planet of The Apes, Charlie and The Chocolate Factory) came up with the orginal story for this clever film.

Back in '93 when I was very young I first saw it. I was too young to complete a complex thought about the film but now I am. I've seen the movie dozens of times between then a now and have been trying to get the DVD for a while now and finally got it recently. Watching the deleted scenes and photos were fun because I got to know what it was like to make the movie and what they did. The movie has been critcally praised and all I've heard were good things from the people who've seen it.<p>The film starts by seeing that all of the holiday's have there own town. Creatures and people representing people heard around that holiday.(Monsters on Halloween,Elfs on Christmas etc)They celebrate that holiday when the time comes and in the woods there are trees with the doors to those places. The story starts in Halloweentown where they are celebrating Halloween. Jack Skellington who is the one loved by most and is the most scariest of all the creatures there. When Halloween ends we learn that Jack has been depressed because it's always the same every year. He ends up walking into the place where all the holidays intersect. He walks into Christmastown and loves everything there. No monsters,no ghouls,no horror. Just happiness and people being jolly. Back at home he ponders about what the meaning of Christmas is only to come up with one solution......to make there own Christmas. Jack and the crew in Halloweentown all make toys they think are beautiful and fun but are really horrible and scary. Jack is warned from his friend Sally who loves his dearly to not go on with it but Jack disagrees. He needs something new to end his Halloween cycle. Jacks big misake is when he sends Halloweentown's finest trick or treaters Lock Shock and Barrel to go and get Santa Clause. The problem is caused when they give him to Oogie Boogie(Bogeyman)and Boogie is a very very evil Halloweentown citizen. Can Christmas be saved?<p>With excellant music and songs by composer Danny Elfman(Spiderman,Planet of the Apes,Novocaines Theme)Great songs include "This is Halloween","Jack's Lament","Sally's Songs","Jack's Obession",and "Poor Jack".<p>Some scenes may be a little scary to some young kids but The Nightmare Before Christmas has fun for everybody...adults and kids alike. A movie that will always be loved and will always be great.<p>ENJOY!</p></br></body></html>

I just didn't watch much TV, but this was a show I'd tune in on for the sly, droll humor. Beyond this show, I lost track of Willis, although I know he starred in movie after movie because I'd see the ads. Alas, I seldom go to movies. In any case, I'm now viewing deep discount DVDs as late night entertainment. I purchase most of the DVDs at a nearby Ross Store, and I came across "The Fifth Element" DVD with Bruce Willis and decided it was worth a viewing.<br /><br />Well, this is one of those science fiction/absolute fantasy movies. The story is so incredibly unreal and improbable that I'm just unable to follow it. Want me to appraise the plot? Complete unmitigated drivel! Now, that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the movie, Quite the contrary, I enjoyed it on a different level. I'm really impressed as to how this awesome movie was put together. Amazing! Willis stars as a taxi driver in a three-dimentional futuristic New York City. It's hard to explain. You have  to see it. Even though it's well in the future, there's still smoking and, evidently, McDonalds is still thriving. Oh, and the NYC garbage problem hasn't gone away. Well, Willis ends up in a space-age encounter and romance with an orange-haired Wonder Woman space alien and they have a surrealistic adventure.<br /><br />The movie is just amazing. No expenses were spared on the sets, the special effects were awesome and it has a cast of thousands. Who cares about the plot? The visuals are excellent and the sound is good. Bruce Willis is, well, Bruce Willis and the entire movie is infused with a droll humor even including visual puns. It's fun to watch. Violence is rampant and hundreds die in a variety of creative and spectacular ways. Even  without a plausible story, it held my attention.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/A34KBK8ORA5GRV.html">A34KBK8ORA5GRV</a><br/><p>BLU-RAY VERSION IS WORTH BUYING. I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE MOVIE, OTHERS ALREADY HAVE. BUT, NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE TELL YOU IF IT IS WORTH UPGRADING FROM YOUR REGULAR DVD TO BLU-RAY. THIS ONE IS WORTH IT. COLORS ARE STUNNING AND SOUNDS GREAT.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>I've always thought this was one of the most visually impressive sci-fi flicks, and the blu-ray is quite impressive. Not a perfect transfer but a very good one; clearly the greedy studios are always holding something back in every new technological jump, be it vhs, dvd, or blu-ray, so that the fans will always have to buy something new.<br /><br />To whit: zero extras on this disc! There were plenty in previous editions, so where'd they go? Bogus.<br /><br />But it is a truly classic flick, and Besson's made none better since. Willis is about as good as he gets, which is pretty good. Always entertaining (but never truly masterful), he's perfect for this role. Oldman is top dog in this flick, for my money, and he's hilarious. But it's the director who really shines.<br /><br />Besson never misses his mark here, and throws in many nods to other genre masterpieces, especially Blade Runner and Star Wars; he obviously learned his lessons from these and many more. The plot moves swiftly throughout, and the film never lags. It's lushly shot, with many delicious compositions making the most of the stellar set design. Fifth Element works on most every level, from its far-fetched but self-effacing script to the performances to the non-stop hyper-colorful eye candy on parade throughout. My only qualm is Chris Tucker's increasingly annoying turn. He's clearly meant to camp it up, but after a while his screaming grates like a baby on a flight to New Zealand. Other than that, this movie is pure pleasure every time I see it.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I'd say hold off on buying this blu-ray until the studio shelves its pathetic greed and includes the extras they included on earlier editions. A movie of this quality deserves only the best treatment, not typical studio weasel greed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Set in the distant future, a cab driver named Korben Dallas ( Bruce Willis) has a tough life until one day he meets a unusual fare that fell into his cab. It's a lovely alien beauty named "Leeloo" ( Milla Jovovich) whom was really a secret experiement as she is known as the ultimate weapon against evil, she with Korben Dallas must save the world from a destructive force as there must be five important elements to destroy it, along his way he meets a cast of colorful characters such as Ruby Rod ( Chris Tucker), Cornelius ( Ian Holm) and the dastardly Zorg ( Gary Oldman).<br /><br />From Luc Besson ( director of "Leon The Professional" and " Le Femme Nikita) comes a totally dazzling, colorful and wonderful Sci-fi fantasy comedy adventure epic which is now a cult favorite among Sci-fi fans. Luc Besson has always dreamed of doing this movie since he was a teen, it finally came true as this movie is a stunning flick with great performances, a witty sense of humor, non-stop action, impressive visual effects, cool aliens, and this movie is totally one of my all time favorite movies.<br /><br />The new 2-Disc Ultimate Edition is a big time improvement over the previous bareboned DVDs in both regular and Superbit forms, but this one has nice extras. It's got a handful of featurettes such as how they designed the movie, a scene that never made it into the final cut, optional full length trivia track, and it has Superbit digital picture with perfect sound quality.<br /><br />This is a must see and must have for Sci-fi DVD collectors everywhere! it's a good time of a movie and one of my choices for best movies of 1997.<br /><br />Also recommended: " Total Recall", " The Running Man", "Blade Runner", "Dark City", " The Dark Crystal", "The Wizard of Oz", " Akira", "Ghost in The Shell", " Metropolis ( 2001 and 1927 versions)", " Armageddon", "Con Air", " Stargate", "Independence Day", "Titanic", " Starship Troopers", " The Terminator 1 & 2", " 6th Day", " Heavy Metal", " Big Trouble in Little China", " Sky Captain and the World of Tommorow", "Star Wars Trilogy", " Star Trek movies", " Ghost in The Shell 2: Innocence", " Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai", " Barberella", " Flash Gordon", " Dune" ( both versions), " Indiana Jones Trilogy", " The Mummy ( 1999)", " Transformers: The Movie".</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) is a retired Space Marine who's chosen the sedentary field of cab driver as his post-military lifestyle.  The trouble is, is that the military needs him.  Again.  <p>Zork (Gary Oldman) wants darkness and evil to take over the Earth . . . and he's helping it out.  And Evil/Darkness has a form; it's a big ball of energy speeding on a collison course toward Earth after millenia wandering the galaxies and looking for the Fifth Element: the only thing that can destroy Evil.  <p>Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) is a resurrected woman found in a destroyed transport ship (she's reconstructed on Earth after they find only a piece of an arm left).  But something is odd about this woman.  She's got superhuman strength, speaks the 'divine' language, and can kick some bad-boy butt!  <p>Ruby Rock (Chris Tucker) is a DJ with some serious attitude.  He's rich, women fawn over him . . . he's the equivalant of a futuristic Wolfman Jack, only with less facial hair.<p>Come to find out, Leeloo IS the Fifth Element and she's the only one who can stop Evil.  But can she?  Or WILL she?  With the help of a washed up Marine (Willis) and a panzy-boy DJ (Tucker) she's got a pretty good shot at it, wouldn't you say?  <p>This SF flick has it all: action, romance, laugh-out-loud antics, and futuristic perspectives.  A very, very, very fun film to watch.  I've seen it at least six times and it always makes me laugh.  Tucker and Willis work like comedic geniuses together whenever they're in the same scene.  <p>A++++ funny film!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I wasn't a fan of this movie back when it first came out in 1997, but after years of my father playing it on DVD I began to love it. You had Blade Runner in the 80's and The Fifth Element in the 90's. Both are Sci-Fi epics that are an acquired taste and get better the more times you watch them. This film introduced the world to Milla Jovovich and it's still one of my favorite performances from her. Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman and Chris Tucker (oh so annoying, but it works here) round out the excellent cast and create memorable characters. The unique visuals and music still hold up extremely well and the "blue diva alien" song still never fails to impress. This was one of my first Blu-rays (very good picture quality) and probably gets more play than the others.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>I finally managed to see The Fifth Element on a screen larger than my television.  I found it quite fun as long as you don't take it too seriously.<br /><br />Every five-thousand years a force of pure evil enters the universe.  In Egypt is an ancient weapon that is the only thing that can stop the evil.  The four elements of earth, air, fire and water surround a fifth element and thus form the weapon.  Aliens decided the weapon was not safe where it was so they took it with a promise to return it at the right time.<br /><br />In our future, the time arrives and we don't have the weapon.  Luckily the aliens contact us that they are on the way.  But space pirates blow them up.  A few cells are found and cloned into a woman.  She links up with a cab driver and through some convolutions of plot, the two go off to Fulston's Paradise to collect the four elements.  Once the elements are collected and taken to the proper location, there is still the question of activation.  Eventually this happens, the evil is thwarted, Earth gets a new satellite and we get a James Bond ending.<br /><br />I already told you I thought the movie was fun so I will now tell you why it is silly.  The cloning was really funny.  The being in question has fifty times the DNA as a human but the scientists can still read and understand it.  The clone is actually built and not cloned.  Little robotic arms build a skeleton as if using Lego blocks.  The internal organs and muscles are woven onto the skeleton with a device Ronco used to sell to kids.  After all of that they have to trick the body into growing skin by using ultraviolet bombardment.  Skin growth takes less than a minute.  The resulting clone has dyed hair; bright orange with blonde roots.<br /><br />The Federation President is another matter all together.  For one, he seems to be patterned after a certain Star Trek officer.  Secondly he shows no real control or competency.  Considering the role of the media in the film it is hard to believe that the weak-eyed, lisping man could have been elected.  Much of the action occurs on a cruise ship while it is in orbit.  While in orbit various characters feel that the way to accomplish their goals is to cause large explosions on the vessel that is keeping them alive.  Not even the passengers are worried about this.<br /><br />But despite all of the silliness it is a fun movie.  There aren't many films these days that are both bad and entertaining.  Not like in the good old days.  So for a little escapist entertainment I have to recommend The Fifth Element.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>The Fifth Element starring Bruce Willis and the ever beautiful and alluring Milla Jovovich is definitely among my most favorite films of all time.  This is one of those rare films that I can watch over and over again, despite a good majority of it being based in comedy where you'd think it would get old but it doesn't.  Bruce Willis's performance is up to par with his "hero" persona and right on with his comedic tendencies.  Milla Jovovich, wow!  She is incredibly beautiful and was extraordinarily well matched for this particular role.  Gary Oldman also does an outstanding job as the "quasi" villain of the film as he's set as the comedic pawn of evil.  Visually, director Luc Besson puts to screen an interesting futuristic earth.<p>The premise:<p>Set approximately three hundred years in the future, this outstanding film begins with a look into the past setting up the need for the "fifth" element.  Cutting back to the future we meet Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) who is a retired Major from Earth's military!  He's down on his luck and working as cab driver.  We then have the privilege of seeing Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) being reconstructed!  Through chance and circumstance Leeloo literally flings herself into Korben's cab.  What follows from this point is nothing short of one of the most hilarious and intriguing Sci-Fi/comedy films to grace the silver screen and the home theater!<p>Special Features:<p>If you're into DVD's jam packed with all kinds of special features, "The Fifth Element" isn't for you!  Normally, this is something I do not mind as the main reason I purchase DVD's is for the film itself, in this case though it would've been nice to at least thrown in a theatrical trailer or something, but alas there are no special features on this DVD.<p>I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of the genre or the stars that perform so admirably in this film!  {ssintrepid}</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>If you judge &#65533;The Fifth Element&#65533; by its plot, it does not measure up to other sci-fi classics. It&#65533;s child-like and absurd, though one could argue that this is part of what makes it so disarming and wondrous. The components that really make it stand out are the glorious sets designs, the spectacular scenes, and the acting. [The performances may not be Oscar-worthy, but they are energetic and slyly amusing.] This is a grand visual treat, and, for once, all the vast amounts of money spent on a movie are truly &#65533;up there on the screen&#65533;. I have seen &#65533;The Fifth Element&#65533; four or five times, and each viewing brings a new appreciation of just how much thought and effort went into this production. <p>The film starts with a standard sci-fi movie prolog. A team of German archeologists is in Egypt [not again!] uncovering some very odd things. The date is 1914, just before World War I. They have found some sort of shrine to the four elements plus a mysterious fifth element. Suddenly, their work is interrupted by large, strange aliens who announce that they are there to take the stones representing the four elements before war comes. They promise to return them before another force, which is bent on destroying all life in the universe, can do its work. <p>Suddenly the movie switches, not to present day as expected, but to 300 years into the future. The time for the battle between good and evil has arrived. We meet a succession of eccentric, delightful characters. There is Leelou [Milla Jovovich], who is the fifth element &#65533; a beautiful, powerful being who represents the life force. She alone can defeat the forces of death. Korbin Dallas [Bruce Willis] is an ex-army office turned taxi driver. He is unwillingly drawn into the fray and sticks around mainly because of his fascination with Leeloo. We have a ditzy, befuddled priest named Vito Cornelius [Ian Holm] who belongs to an order which has served the forces that protect life for centuries. His assistant is an equally strange young man called Billy [Luke Perry. Finally, we meet Ruby Rhod [Chris Tucker in a role he was born to play], a transsexual TV star who has to be seen to be believed. Together, this unlikely group bands together to fight for all life as we know it. [The human villain is Zorg, played in high camp style by the amazing Gary Oldham.]<p>Besides the movie&#65533;s already mentioned assets, the thing I love about &#65533;The Fifth Element&#65533; is its refusal to take itself seriously. To me, this makes it far more entertaining than the last two Star Wars films; in fact, it owes more to Daffy Duck than to Darth Vader.  It never expects us to believe the story. It merely tells a very tall tale very well.  <p>The movie was directed by Luc Bresson, who made two of my other favorites &#65533; &#65533;La Femme Nikita&#65533; and &#65533;Leon&#65533;. &#65533;The Fifth Element&#65533;, however, belongs in a completely different category, though all three movies have dazzling cinematography by Thierry Arbogast and pulsating music by Eric Serra.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CFNHYZG6WS8.html">A27CFNHYZG6WS8</a><br/><p>Luc Besson is a late 20th century Frank Tashlin, a live-action cartoonist who deploys all the resources of pop culture at his disposal to launch a critique of that culture and its ideological processes, while retaining its energy and pleasures.  Like Tashlin, Besson is a canny businessman, able to play the marketing/financing game to ensure big budgets and big stars which he utilises for parodic and ironic purposes.  He's lucky that Bruce Willis is game, merrily sending up his perspiring 'Die Hard' action he-man image, his trademark singlet turned orange to match the heroine's carrotty hair.  As well as the pumping grind of Willis' films, Besson litters 'The Fifth Element' with allusions to the likes of 'Star Wars', 'Close Encounters' and 'Star Trek', over-egging their adolescent fantasy, revealing their modes to be the highest camp, a big-budget inflation of a Village People video, maybe one directed by Sergio Leone.  And onlookers were surprised the film didn't go down well in America?!<p>'Element' is a comic flipside to 'Blade Runner''s dour post-modernism, with the emphasis firmly on gender.  The hero is a mixture of action man (ex-military hero) and Everyman (cab driver) with requisite 'personal' problems (his wife left him).  These cliches are roundly mocked, backstory is rendered absurd, and in a classic running joke, Willis is the victim of a hectoring mother constantly on the phone.  The heroine is a replicant created, in mock-Biblical/'Bride of Frankenstein' style, from the DNA of a severed limb (Dr. Freud!).  Her attempts to learn English reveal the film's self-consciousness about its status as a French product trying to infiltrate the American market [the heavy, ambiguous presence of corporate product placement]: she attempts to understand words through pictures (for instance, 'war' is explained in a hysterical 'Clockwork Orange'-type montage): the cinema as post-literate lingua franca?  <p>Everything in the film is purloined from US action and sci-fi movies, from the fuzzy mystical premise of the fifth element to the action narrative sublimating a deferred love story, to the high-voltage high-body-count action set-pieces.  But whereas American movies seek to affirm cliched images of gender - heroic masculinity, dependent femininity - 'Element' wreaks havoc on them, mixing genders, races and species with joyous abandon, and putting them through a camp blender in which costumes, make-up, dialogue, art-direction, music, performance, action choreography, motivation, editing and camerawork smash mainstream ideological certainties and functions.  I never thought I'd say this about a Luc Besson movie, but 'Element' is enormous fun, right down to its wicked parody of former 'cinema du look' cohort Jean-Jacques Beineix's 'Diva'.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>The name "Bruce Willis" usually means it is going to be an excellent film.  This time Bruce Willis tries a CGI-effects science fiction film.  This is his 30th film.<br /><br />  In "Languages", you must press on "English 5.1" to get sound for the film.<br /><br />  You may choose "Fact Track" to receive facts about the film in English or Spanish while film is playing.  It will replace subtitles.<br /><br />  Bruce Willis plays "Korben Dallas", your typical alpha-male who wakes up with a cigarette, stereo playing and television on.  He also owns a white pussycat that keeps coming back home.<br /><br />  It's the year 2214.  Willis drives a mid-air taxi-cab (remember the Jetson's airship?) where on this day he picks up Milla Jovovich (Resident Evil [2002], Resident Evil: Apocalypse [2004]).  It guess orange hair is still in style.  She was just re-created and talks in babbling.<br /><br />  McDonald's Restaurant is still around on the 25th floor with a whole new meaning to "drive-in".<br /><br />  Disc 2 includes the "Special Features".  Too many to list, but some highlights are:<br /><br />  The Star Element: Interviews with Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich.<br /><br />  The Diva featurette includes interview with Maiwenn who played the Diva Plavalaguna.  This will also include the entire performance of Maiwenn against green screen.<br /><br />Note: Maiwenn played the Diva Plavalaguna, but was lip-syncing the opera.  It is soprano, Inva Mula's voice doing the aria.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>Whatever you do, do not expect Die Hard in space if you watch Fifth Element.  This movie may star Bruce Willis but this was the beginning of his search for alternative roles.  This is a Science Fiction movie that does not rely on the Science Fiction to entertain.  It is light hearted, exciting, often funny and a blast to watch.  So many aspects to this movie are well balanced into the story, but at the same time, it remains human on all levels.  The incredible set pieces and visual affects never overtake the story.  Luc Besson does a great job of directing Willis, who plays a retired Military Major (retired due to personal reasons) who is asked to take on a mission of great importance.  He falls into protecting Lelu (Mila Jovavich), a beautiful and prophesized individual (woman) who is expected to save the world.  The adventure that they go through is fun to watch.  Willis' character falls for Lelu, being an expert soldier doesn't keep him from feeling what he knows is there.  As the movie moves on, we are treated to some of the most original set pieces, make up, creatures and costumes that we have ever seen.  The mood of the movie is brighter then you would think, considering some of the scenes deal directly with death and destruction.  All the actors are good and appear to be having a great time making this movie.  Gary Oldman is particularly evil as the Corporate guru who cares nothing for anyone.  Chris Tucker is introduced in this movie and is extremely obnoxious, but hilarious at the same time.  All in all, this movie may not be ground breaking or provocative, but it takes many elements we all know and gives us The Fifth Element, something original, fun and highly entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A86R2KZIFHKLB.html">A86R2KZIFHKLB</a><br/><p>I have to give this movie 5 stars, this still remains one of my favorite movies. The remastered version on blu-ray is spectacular, excellent transfer. This movie proves it can be humorous, even in the face of world ending evil. This movie has something for everyone, aliens, carnage, scientists, evil men, a really evil entity, adventure, heroism, guns, bombs, explosions, love, and saving the world. A great mix for a movie. Enjoy the view!</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>The visuals are jaw-dropping.

Make sure you see this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>First time I watched this it was one of those three star things that you could take or leave. Yes it had all the elements (except the fifth) that make for a good shoot-um-up space thing. But I just looked at it as an action movie.<br /><br />For some reason this movie can grow on you and you find yourself anticipating the next move. Then you see things that you did not see the first time. Then you start to mouth the words. Soon this turns into a five star movie with a plot, good guys, bad guys, and good bad guys. Soon you start looking in your auto-wash to see if you left anything in there.<br /><br />An ancient thereat of dome looms over the earth. An ancient religion keeps the secret of the doom and the secret of the defense (the fifth element.) Prophecy turns into reality and it is up to Major Koeben Dallas (Bruce Willis) to find the fifth element and save the earth.<br /><br />Will he be able to do this and at what emotional expense?<br />What is the fifth element?</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>This is an incredibly stylish sci-fi film. There's so much color in this futuristic world, and I don't mean that it's all very in-your-face flashy. It's almost cyberpunk with dashes of colorful modern-day indie styles. I'm not sure if that's put correctly, but I think you get the idea: it almost looks and feels like an anime film. I doubt that major cities will look like the futuristic New York City as seen here, but the designs are nonetheless stunning to look at.<br /><br />Not only did I get a kick at the film's sci-fi style, I was also greatly amused by some of the performances (Oldman and Tucker in particular). Bruce Willis may not be an ideal man for a sci-fi atmosphere, but he does a very god job here. Milla Jovovich is a bit of an annoyance when she first appears, but as the movie continues the annoyance soon vanishes and she gives a very lovely performance as Leeloo (her fight sequence will surely amaze). And by the way, her clothes and her hair look so delicious! Ian Holm never fails: he gives a very believable performance as Vito Cornelius. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, he is more than just a hobbit. Chris Tucker? People may not like his character Ruby Rod, but his loudmothed humor actually adds much to the film. I did find myself laughing at his constant bragging and screaming whenever he's in the face of danger. And finally, the real standout here is the iconic Gary Oldman. This time he uses a very Southern accent for his character Zorg. The entertainment value in The Fifth Element starts to find itself at the very top whenever the man's on screen. "This case is supposed to be FULL!"<br /><br />The music is also worth of mention. Eric Serra has given us a very diverse music score. It's full of keyboards, synthesizers, strings, brass, woodwinds, percussion, and Middle Eastern instruments. Everyone remembers "Lucia di Lammermoor" and "Diva Dance," right? These two sequences in the film are simply the best when it comes to the music.<br /><br />Will this film be forgotten in the future, or become overrated? I doubt it. This is a cult classic, and I don't think it'll ever go away. I just hope it doesn't become a victim of a future remake (!).<br /><br />Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>THE FIFTH ELEMENT is a great science fiction-comedy-action-satire. Kudos to director Luc Besson for putting together such an eye-popping, funny ( often hilarious ), adrenalin-charged rush of a space-opera. Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, and Gary Oldman are all excellent, but Chris Tucker as Ruby Rhod steals every scene he's in. The CGI work on this film is spectacular.

This 2007 Remastered Blu ray is the one to get because there was problems with the earlier 2006 version!!!

A+</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Director Luc Besson wrote this script while he was in high school, taking every `element' he loved so much about science fiction and creating a Frankenstein type creature; an amalgam of all that is `sci-fi'.  With that said, `The Fifth Element' works extremely well for what it is, which is nothing more than cheesy B-Grade sci-fi entertainment.  It's not supposed to be intellectual or moving; it's supposed to be fun, and `fun' it certainly is.  It has all the `elements' that make up sure-fire entertainment.  There is high speed chase scenes, big-dumb aliens, big-bad weapons, the mysterious hot chick, intense action sequences, great special effects, the token `funny' guy (bet you though I was going another route there) and above all else; Bruce `freaking' Willis.<br /><br />I'll just get this out of the way right now; I have been a fan of Willis for years.  If there is any actor I feel that goes unrecognized for what he does it is Bruce.  Why oh why do critics across the country feel that the only performances worth recognizing are the dramatic, emotional ones?  What law out there says that the action genre is not plump for the picking?  Bruce Willis is `god' in the action world.  There is no other action star that can do what he does.  I would have handed him an Oscar a long time ago (`Die Hard' anyone).  Sadly, he hasn't ever even been nominated.<br /><br />Here Willis is once again our hero.  Korben Dallas is a cab driver in the future (the year 2263 to be exact) who ends up biting off more than he can chew (is there anything really too much for Bruce to handle?) when a beautiful woman falls, literally, into his cab.  This stranger is Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sabat, or Leeloo for short.  Leeloo just so happens to be the only hope for human civilization.  She is the supreme being, the perfect woman; the fifth element.  With the aid of Korben as well as Father Vito Cornelius, Leeloo takes off on an adventure against the darkest of evil.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich is marvelous here as Leeloo.  She is everything that her character needed to be; exotic, beautiful and dangerous.  The very fact alone that she learnt an entirely made up language and `mastered' it adds major brownie points indeed.  Gary Oldman is the perfect bad guy here; evil genius to a T, and Ian Holm was a nice touch (love this guy).  Chris Tucker is hilarious as Ruby Rhod, the worlds favorite media darling.  I've always thought that Tucker was a great addition to any film, and he delivers masterfully here.  Whoever says that comedy isn't an art form is blind.  And then we have Bruce; good ol' Bruce.  What can I say?  Willis is the greatest working action star and he never fails to bring the goods.<br /><br />Like I said, `The Fifth Element' is one nonstop fun filled ride complete with every `element' that makes these B-Grade sci-fi films so entertaining.  Don't let critics and their narrow-minds keep you away from this film.  Sure, if you're expecting a masterfully crafted and profound film that will stimulate your mind then you are looking in the wrong place, but if you just want to turn your mind off and have a blast with your friends this Saturday night then look no further than `The Fifth Element'.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FEQXNCFC68KC.html">A3FEQXNCFC68KC</a><br/><p>This is a really fun, fun movie. It's not the beat all of science fiction as it was hyped when it was released, but it certainly is a good combination high adventure, situation comedy, cyberpunk, and Bruce Willis gun fighting action. Doesn't make sense? Don't worry. I'll explain.<br /><br />High adventure comes from the plot: save the earth from evil by finding some mystic items and a perfect human before the appointed zero hour. That much is obvious. Cyberpunk explains in a way the setting of the futuristic urban scenes, which are fantastically portrayed in this movie. All of the settings and technology were impressive as well as stylish. The special effects were well above average and in many scenes very impressive, but a situation comedy? You got it. I won't get into the details. I will say there are quite a few scenes that involve the kind of subplots you find in sitcoms. This is a good thing by the way. A lesser movie would mess this up. Director Luc Besson made all of these elements (no pun intended) fit seamlessly.<br /><br />Acting is great. Despite popular opinion of models not being very good actors the models that acted in this film did a good job of being campy in an entertaining way without hamming it up. I can go on an on about each of the reas actors and how they succeeded in pulling off whatever character, but I will digress to two ends of the spectrum. Chris Tucker as Ruby Rhod is priceless and worth the price of admission alone. One exception I would have to say is Tommy "Tiny" Lister as the President. Up until the final scenes his acting was pretty dry. I also have to criticize whoever decided to hype up the fact the movie has Luke Perry in it, who played Billy. Billy did nothing to carry the plot and only had a cameo role in the beginning. Ugh... Hollywood.<br /><br />The movie can get too trendy. The music, though nice, didn't really fit the setting. The very last scene is totally lame and if you ask me unlikely (sorry Korby...). And there is a scene or two that was just trying too hard to be hip. I can forgive all that because the comedy, action and drama do fit in to what ends up being a mirthful romp in high flying action.<br /><br />Sony dropped the ball on their first blu-ray release of The Fifth Element. The uncompressed PCM and Dolby 5.1 surround tracks blew you away, but the video quality was merely on par with regular DVD resolution. This time Sony listened to their fans and remastered the movie so that you get the full 1080p love you deserved the last time. Bought the first blu-ray? No problem. Sony seems to be offering an exchange program. Just contact Sony and they will set up a way you can pass your old blu-ray for the remastered one. Contact info is below:<br /><br />Phone: (800) 860-2878<br />Email: consumer@sphecustomersupport.sony.com<br /><br />One downside though: no extras. That's right. All the cool stuff in the ultimate edition is gone. Getting this DVD is just like getting the first one they released. You get only the movie and some trivia text. If I were you I would still wait until they make some kind of special edition in blu-ray so you get the higher resolution AND the goodies.<br /><br />If you want to experience a varied range of pleasant emotions without taking any one of them too seriously then you're going to love The Fifth Element. If you want high definition and special features then you better wait. I am betting this is going to be the case with most (if not all) new HD-DVD and Blu-Ray DVDs that first come out.</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>The story goes that director Luc Besson began writing THE FIFTH ELEMENT in his teens, incorporating all the Sci-Fi elements he loved into one over-the-top, grand space opera...sort of an "E.E. 'Doc' Smith 'Skylark' Meets Flash Gordon and Barbarella" hybrid with sex, intergalactic action, and even some pseudo-religious overtones tossed in...in other words, a teenage daydream come true! Critics panned the end result for this very reason, sneering at Bruce Willis' Earth-saving (yet again!) Korben Dallas, and Besson's then-girlfriend, clothing-optional Milla Jovovich, as the innocent demigod, Leeloo.<br /><br />The critics were wrong!<br /><br />THE FIFTH ELEMENT is, in the best sense of the word, a classic 'B' movie, a space opera where a prologue vaguely similar to STARGATE leads to a future Earth where traffic jams occur thirty stories above the ground, humanity is ruled by beefy 'Tiny' Lister Jr., and where the Ultimate Evil is served by everyone's favorite villain, Gary Oldman, sporting a Southern accent! If this DOESN'T convince you that this is a 'popcorn' flick, not to be taken too seriously, there is Chris Tucker, sporting a blond hairdo, as the Galaxy's favorite media personality, promoting himself as he hits on his adoring female fans; Ian Holm, as the monk who knows 'the Secret', forced, despite himself, to become an active participant in the adventure; and some of the most ... ugly alien mercenaries you'll ever see, terrorizing a space resort, until they meet their match in Bruce Willis' 'DIE HARD in Space' protagonist! Yippee-Ki-Yay, indeed!<br /><br />The FX are astonishing, the comedy, broad and sly, the heroics, macho, and as Leeloo, sent to save Earth, Jovovich manages to be both naive and sexy, with broken English and a gymnast's grace.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is a joy, as always, to watch, and he carries the film with charm and self-depreciating humor, whether dealing with endless phone calls from his mother, driving his sky taxi recklessly (cabbies change very little in the future!), taking on terrorists single-handed, or falling for the exotic Leeloo. When he blows away a roomful of hostage-holding aliens, then asks, "Does anyone else want to negotiate?", you KNOW Besson picked the right guy for the lead!<br /><br />If you want Profound Science Fiction, watch 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY again...but if you want to kick back and just have fun, look no further...THE FIFTH ELEMENT delivers!</p></br><a href="../users/A41I67QYRAOSQ.html">A41I67QYRAOSQ</a><br/><p>Don't know why I haven't added it to my library yet, because it is an all time favorite.  It's weird.  It's warped.  The characters and acting are over the top.  Though its not a cartoon, it plays like cartoon characters. Its got romance.  Its got impending doom.  Its got ancient dudes.  Its got a futuristic society.  Its got space travel.  Its got a really bad villian.  Its got Chris Tucker as this WAY out there music star.

It is a movie that is just plain fun. It is rather over-the-top in a lot of ways but that is its charm. Well worth watching when you want a wild ride through an impossible future. The special effects are great and the humor ranges from tongue-in-cheek to outrageous<br /><br />GOOD SEE IT</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>The Fifth Element is an overall superbly done film, well-acted as it is hilariously entertaining. Not the best actor around, Chris Tucker gives a hilarious performance as a near psychotic radio host, and Bruce Willis is the hero as he is in much of every film he plays in. The music for The Diva (who is brutally murdered) is performed superbly and is gorgeously sung.</p></br><a href="../users/A12IRGQLFE4EBA.html">A12IRGQLFE4EBA</a><br/><p>This was such a strange movie... there are colors and things and strange happenings all over the place.  The first time I saw it I actually did not like it.  Then I took a second look and was blown away.  Everything just pops out at you.  Chris Tucker's performance is hilarious and Milla Jovovich was awesome.  This is a strange one -- may take some of us slower folks to see the brilliance in it, but what a wild ride!</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>This film is a cross between "Blade Runner" and "Flash Gordon."  It has the slick special effects and subtley smart script of the first mixed with the over-the-top look and complete campiness of the second.  But what makes this fun to watch more times are the ridiculous antics of all the characters with their overacting, brilliantly stupid costumes, and really bad haircuts.  Bruce Willis reprises his "Die Hard" role this time in an expensive sci-fi setting and he pulls off the action hero well.  What's great about Bruce Willis is that he is the underrated "every-guy" caught in an amazing situation; and unlike most hero-types who never get hurt during the course of their adventure, Mr. Willis once again takes some bloody shots.  But he emerges smiling in the end, albeit covered with grit, draped in torn clothing stained in his enemy's blood.  This is also a perfect fit for Milla Jovovich.  Unlike the appalling "The Messenger" in which her overacting was so bad as to be laughable, here it melds well with the overall campy feel of the movie.  Gary Oldman is very nearly too much even for this extravaganza, but eventually can be forgiven for trying too hard.  While Chris Tucker steals every scene he is in.  Whether that is a good thing or not depends on the viewer.  The first time I saw this, in the theater, I was rolling my eyes at his painful performance.  But every time since I've laughed at his work here repeatedly.  What was a personally nice surprise here was Ian Holm who plays Priest Cornelius.  It's truly a rare film to find him using his comic talents.  Most times he is playing Shakespearean types or other pompous British characters.  Here, however, he is very funny.  This film cost $60 million to make, and the special effects were worth every penny.  Just remember that this is, in essence, a comical sci-fi adventure story, and really shouldn't be taken seriously. Later.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>"The Fifth Element" has so many illogical plot holes that eventually your brain stops noticing them. It'sd a dumb scifi epic that knows how dumb it is, and as a result it doesn't take itself seriously. With some good acting, bad acting, and a lot of bright colors, this is an entertaining way to spend a weekend evening.<p>In 1914, in anticipation of war the alien Mondoshawi took four mystical stones from Earth. The four stones represent the four elements, and when centered around the perfect being (the Fifth Element) they become a weapon against the forces of darkness and evil, who show up every five thousand years. (No, don't ask why!) Their contact is always a priest of indeterminate religion, who has been given the "knowledge" from his predecessors. Three hundred years later, a dark planetoid is zooming toward Earth, increasing in size and swallowing warships. When the Mondoshawi attempt to return the stones to Earth, they're blown up by the thugs of Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg (Gary Oldman). Isn't that a great name?<p>All that's left is the hand of the Fifth Element, which the president's scientists clone into a beautiful young woman (Milla Jovovich) who speaks the "Divine Language" only. But the Fifth Element -- nicknamed Leeloo -- escapes and falls into the cab of a bitter-with-a-heart-of-gold ex-military cabbie, Corbin Dallas (Bruce Willis). He takes her to the priest who is supposed to help her, Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm). The problem is, the Evil will be there in a few days, and the stones are missing. With the help of Cornelius, Leeloo, and the unspeakably annoying Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker), Dallas must stop the powers of darkness from destroying the universe. (I can't believe I just wrote that)<p>You can tell this is an unusual film just by the colors -- French director Luc Besson revels in bright blues and reds and yellows. And what other movie would have opera singing during a martial-arts sequence? It's a quirky vision of the future, with New York much as it is now (noisy, crowded, full of bad drivers in aircars), McDonald's, otherwordly resorts, annoying radio talk show hosts, and a little box that applies your makeup for you. (I want one of those) <p>Bruce Willis is okay as Corbin Dallas. Not great, not bad, just okay. He does have some really sparkling moments, such as when Corbin is at the opera, or when he describes Leeloo to a friend, but most of the time he seems very "Die Hard." Milla Jovovich uses her expressive face, eyes and body to best effect, especially since Leeloo speaks gibberish most of the time. (Her wild flailing when Leeloo is in the cloning tube is amazing, like a trapped animal) And she seems a lot like a baby in an adult body sometimes, repeating "autowash" and "multipass" and giggling with delight over chicken dinners. Ian Holm is, as always, wonderful as the kindly little priest, who manages to remain semi-dignified under very circumstances. He's cute. Gary Oldman revels weirdly in his role as the ultra-evil-for-no-reason Zorg. And Chris Tucker wins the prize for most annoying supporting character: An effeminate, loud, obnoxious, pointless-in-the-plot radio talk show host who will drive many viewers up the wall. (At least the hero despises him)<p>The dialogue ranges from very funny ("Too bad it's not loaded") to very, very corny ("We are lost!"); the soundtrack is very good as well, ranging from opera to pop. There's some sexual content (very weird and not at all sexy) and some nudity (brief and vague), nd not a lot of cursing. And in the age of CGI, it's nice to see that there are still movies that are unafraid to stick rather silly rubber masks on the actors. (The masks do, admittedly, fit the movie -- the special effects are less prominent than you'd expect)<p>Basically, "Fifth Element" is a good movie for when you don't want to use your brain. With the good (Holm and Jovovich) the bad (Tucker) and the REALLY ugly (all of Rhod's clothes, and the Mangalore thugs), it's entertaining if flawed brain fluff.</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>`The Fifth Element', directed by Luc Besson and starring hero Bruce Willis and my favorite heavy, Gary Oldman is something of an enigma to me, because in spite of its high powered stars, excellent story, and strong direction, I took practically no notice of it when it first came out in the theatre. My hypothesis is that part of this excellent movie's problem is that it is a cross of at least three genres, Science Fiction, Fantasy, and satire. The best illustrations of the last genre is Mel Brooks' `Young Frankenstein' and that great cult hit `Rocky Horror Picture Show'. Both are so well realized that they almost work as true horror movies, if it weren't for the fact that they were even better spoofs and comedies.<br /><br />`The Fifth Element', on the surface, looks a bit like that great Science Fiction movie, `Blade Runner', especially since it is such a good pairing of hero (Harrison Ford) and heavy (Rutger Hauer), just like our Willis and Oldman duo here. But, `Element' just goes too far over the top in the `what if' department that you simply can't take it seriously. It is almost more like the realization of `The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy', except that it never wallows in the absurd the way `Hitchhiker' does. And, it takes its story just serious enough to bring it back into serious Fantasy rather than staying in absurdist humor.<br /><br />Another contrast which comes to mind is the fact that this movie has some strong similarities to that greatest of fantasies, `Lord of the Rings', in that both involve a quest by an unwilling hero against seemingly impossible odds. But then, you come back to the humor, and you loose a lot of the epic aura that made `Lord of the Rings' so great.<br /><br />If there were nothing else good in this movie, the flick would still be worthwhile for the performance of Milla Jovovich as the title character. This seems like a perfect match of role with actor, just as Brad Pitt's performance in another Willis vehicle, `The Twelve Monkeys' was a great match of actor and role, leading to a strongly deserved Oscar nomination. Other performances are also strong. Oldman, as usual, is the epitome of the droll, yet ultimately menacing heavy.  Ian Holm (also in `Lord of the Rings', to make the parallel just a bit more interesting) is a perfect parody of a Gandalf like character, but with little backbone and no magic to speak of. Another interesting piece of casting is Brion James (Rutger Hauer's sidekick in `Blade Runner') as a deadpan general commissioned with the job of getting retired soldier Willis to save the world. And, Chris Tucker is just flat out over the top goofy, fitting his role to a tee, squared.<br /><br />I have never been especially impressed with Bruce Willis' acting in movies past, but he always seems to fit his roles like a glove. In this role, someone like Schwarzenegger could not be cynical enough, Harrison Ford would probably be too serious, Tom Cruise would probably be too earnest, and Clint Eastwood is too old (and making too much money as a director).<br /><br />Except for the fact that the story is far too original, it has all the feel of a graphic novel serialized in `Heavy Metal'. Both the goofy story and the bazaar art direction (check out the police uniforms and compare them to the typical Mobius drawings in `Heavy Metal').<br /><br />One sure sign that the story is being played for melodrama and laughs is the scant 2 seconds by which our heroes save the Earth, by a kiss, of course. This business is straight out of `Goldfinger', another film that plays suspense for its melodrama and humor.<br /><br />Two sure signs that this is a worthwhile movie is that it is fun to rewatch at least once a year and it is fun to write about.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of humor, fantasy, and science fiction, in that order.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UQIIJ2CD8REE.html">A2UQIIJ2CD8REE</a><br/><p>In a 23rd Century New York City, down on his luck cabdriver Korben Dallas gets the surprise of his life when the woman of his dreams suddenly crashes through the roof of his flying taxi and into his backseat. Korben is instantly caught up in an eternal and universal battle between good and evil on which the fate of the Earth all depends. Leeloo, the mysterious young woman who has fallen into Korben's life, is sought after by both forces, and it's up to him to protect her and see that she is able to carry out her secret mission. Together with the help of the government and a pair of monks, Korben and Leeloo travel to the vacation planet of Fhloston, flamboyant radio D.J. Ruby Rhod at their side. Aboard the luxurious cruise ship hotel known as "Fhloston Paradise," Korben and Leeloo battle off the attacks of hideous alien rogues and powerful businessman Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg, and meet an enthralling opera singer called Diva Plavalaguna who provides them with the four sacred stones necessary to save the Earth. Of course, the stones are useless to the heroes without the most important element to their cause, the Fifth Element.<br /><br />Bruce Willis stars as lovestruck Major turned cabdriver Korben Dallas, along with Milla Jovovich as the beautiful super-soldier believed to be the "Fifth Element." Gary Oldman is the ruthless Emanuel Zorg, Ian Holm is Father Cornelius, and Chris Tucker is the hilariously played celebrity D.J. Ruby Rhod. First-time viewers of "The Fifth Element" who are fans of the genre will likely immediately recognize similarities to the Harry Canyon sequence of the 1981 animated cult classic "Heavy Metal." In truth, the glorious visual style that epitomizes "The Fifth Element" harkens back to much of this film. This is not by accident. Writer/Director Luc Besson's inspiration for "The Fifth Element" relied greatly on the work of the French artists who created the original "Heavy Metal" magazine, whom Luc hired to help him create this masterpiece of cinematic art. That having been said, it's no wonder that "Fifth Element" will probably find its strongest fans among those who are lovers of such films as "Heavy Metal," "Rock and Rule," and other such adult sci-fi fantasies. "The Fifth Element" is a lively, colorful, exciting, hilarious, and visually stunning ride from beginning to end, telling a wild but meaningful story with fantastic characters and creatures that have to be seen to be believed. The amount of art and work that went into making this remarkable film is astonishing! The unique, lavish costumes were designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier and the music by Eric Serra is terrific!  The 2-disc Ultimate Edition DVD is beautifully presented in widescreen and contains over 120 minutes of featurettes covering the conception, effects, creatures, actors, and fashion. The DVD also offers a poster gallery, visual tests, and a feature-length trivia track in lieu of a commentary. Surprisingly, there is no theatrical trailer for the movie itself, though it does include trailers for three other films, most notably "Mirrormask." If you are at all a fan of the sci-fi, futuristic genre of films, pick up "The Fifth Element" today! McDonald's Drive-Thru attendants never looked so good!</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>First, the basics: Bruce Willis pretty much ensures a good action flick, so this is really a SF-action-comedy. Effects are good, even judging a `97 film by `04 standards. Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) has babe appeal, which the film uses nicely without overusing it. And, in case anyone was wondering, the Earth is saved. As usual.<br /><br />After that, the movie offers a few unique points of visual styling. The most remarkable one was that white stripey thing Leeloo wears for the first part of her role. It keeps us in suspense, eagerly awaiting a Janet Jackson event that never occurs. That's ordinary enough - what's remarkable is that the outfit is a friendly knock-off of one used in a 1970s performance-art video, Rebecca Horn's "Einhorn." Well, if you're going to swipe an idea, swipe the best.<br /><br />There are two wonderful action sequences, fast cuts back and forth between two concurrent but unrelated scenes. One alternates between a spaceship takeoff and a Ru-Paul-eque Ruby Dee giving a toe-curling moment to a stewardess. The other switches between Leeloo punching up some bad guys and an abstract dance performance. Both cases give some heavy handed but enjoyable visual puns connecting the parallel scenes.<br /><br />So where does the comedy come in? Everywhere. It starts with benificent aliens - they look like buzzard beaked jukeboxes with glow-in-the-dark codpieces. Goofy bits continue to the last scene, where the president would congratulate our hero and heroine, except that they're already rewarding each other with - well, with each other.<br /><br />This is just fun. There's no big lesson, there's no social or scientific plausibility. There is good visual presentation, good action, and a few chuckles. Lord knows I've seen worse.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/ARFCORBCTKX1J.html">ARFCORBCTKX1J</a><br/><p>Please note that the 4-star rating is for the film itself. As a Blu-ray disk, it gets /at least/ 5 stars.<br /><br />"The Fifth Element" is one of those films you have to accept on its own terms. It's so silly and has so many off-the-wall elements that the initial viewing can be very off-putting, especially in a story about the possible destruction of humanity. It works best if you shut off your critical and reasoning faculties, and just "go with the flow".<br /><br />Beeson throws in lots of "Star Wars" references, which I'll leave you to note and laugh at on your own. His direction is apt and assured, but some of the acting is not up to par. Ian Holm, in particular, so overplays the priest's discomfort and confusion that it becomes unbelievable. (And in a movie that's fundamentally unbelievable, that's saying something.) On the other hand, Gary Oldman (not surprisingly) gives an imaginative and controlled interpretation of the story's human villain.<br /><br />The real star of this Blu-ray disk is the transfer itself. The image is so razor-sharp and beautifully textured -- without any apparent enhancement artifacts -- that one cannot even /imagine/ a better 1080p transfer. The sound verges on the spectacular, with plenty of surround action.<br /><br />Among high-definition demo disks, "The Fifth Element" is "primer inter pares". If you simply want a disk to show off your new 60" Pioneer Elite Kuro plasma display &lt;ahem> (not to mention your sound system), you couldn't choose better.

But I just looked at it as an action movie.<br /><br />For some reason this movie can grow on you and you find yourself anticipating the next move.

There are visuals in the Fifth Element that even to this day look terrific. Compare the Flying cars to the traffic in the backgrounds of Episode I. Lets first understand that The Fifth Element is a visual eye candy extravaganza. Not necessarily the best, but very imaginative. The story is also an invention that couldn't have easily been dreamed up. It's pretty original. Its almost hard to take a movie like The Fifth Element and break it down into pieces, but there are things that could have been better. The story was great, but there where "thickeners" that kept getting in the way. I loved the Chris Tucker character. He kept me laughing throughout the action. But, why put him in this movie at all? I see no reason whatsoever. When it comes down to it, there was no reason. He was comedic relief and thats all. I thought the movie stood still the moment he walked onto the scene. He was great, but out of place. Almost every scene could have been edited in some way. I love long movies, they can sometimes have a lot more to offer, but when a scene gets slow that means it needs to be trimmed to be more direct. Especially in an action film like this. Without these problems the movie would have been more enjoyable and less predictable, but its still a good movie worth seeing. Its lots of fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q.html">A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q</a><br/><p>I've had this movie ever since it first came out and I love, love, love, love it!!!

These four actors (and actress) is just what I think the greatest ever! This movie has the right blend of action, adventure, and humor. The DVD doesn't have so many special features but you can watch in either wide screen or full screen. And the image and sounds are so clear. I can watch this movie over and over and over. If I could, I'd rate &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; 10 stars! Watch this movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A34W7QA4J5UTOR.html">A34W7QA4J5UTOR</a><br/><p>There's just something about this movie that makes me watch it again and again.  It's an interesting story with a good futuristic setting.  One of the features I liked the most about this movie was the music.  It was well suited to the action sequences and sychronized with the movements of the actors.  The movie is funny and just plain fun to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/AMIOLJHCQHGBE.html">AMIOLJHCQHGBE</a><br/><p>Okay. Movie critics need to get a life and realize movies are a viewing experience. Not every movie has social impact or is made to solve the world's problems. This is a Bruce sci-fi film. And I am a Sci-fi fan as well as a Bruce fan (Don't miss 6th Sense or Unbreakable as well as my all time favorite Armageddon). From the spectacular color (rivals Braveheart), the perfectly entwined soundtrack (if you've read my other reviews you know I'm huge on audio/visual), and the interpretation of the future (right there with Bladerunner), this DVD will enthrall you. While Americans are used to stark, hard edged angles in a sci-fi flick, the French director Luc Besson uses smoothed angles and brilliant colors to depict his futuristic vision. The depth of the city scenes equals Bladerunner. Best of all, he cast small bit part but recognizable actors in most roles which had me saying, &quot;I know those guys! Who are they?&quot; Mucho kudos to Gary Oldman who plays the greatest villian of the future! His performance ranks with  Alan Rickman (Die Hard, Quigly Down Under). Mila Jovovitch is fantastic as the unknowing savior of the human race (too bad she did Joan de Arc). There is plenty of tongue and cheek. My favorite is the druggy trying to rob Bruce (&quot;Give me the casssssssssshhhhh&quot; you have to see this). Chris Tucker plays Ruby Rod, a radio show host that is blantantly a spoof of Prince. Dresses better though. He is the perfectly flamboyant counterpart to Bruce's hero. Scatter in some strange humans, some violent aliens, Evil approaching the earth in the form of a planetoid, Oldman as the unwitting villian, and Bruce as the hero, and you would have a nice film. Add in exceptional color and a clashingly synchronistic soundtract that puncuates odd moments, and you have a DVD you must see. If you love Bruce like I do, own this. Trust me. I am never wrong.</p></br><a href="../users/AT2BYFEVLVITT.html">AT2BYFEVLVITT</a><br/><p>This movie is visually spectacular! I have probably watched the movie 30+ times since it came out in theatres and i don't seem to get bored of it. The whole futuristic setting is so much fun to watch. I totally recommend  this dvd to anyone who owns a dvd player!</p></br><a href="../users/A2H22I2RWE0HOV.html">A2H22I2RWE0HOV</a><br/><p>There are two kinds of people out there:  people that love The Fifth Element and people that absolutely hate it.  It is very rare to find someone in the middle.  I know.  One of my best friends absolutely despises The Fifth Element.  This is one of the few thing that we differ opinions on.  Weird.<br /><br />The Fifth Element is definitely not a movie for the casual viewer, I think that is why there are so many out there who hate it.  If you just sat down and popped in the DVD and watched it for the hell of it, you would probably wind up hating it.  It is one of those sci-fi movies like 12 Monkeys or Brazil that you need to watch more than once to get it completely.<br /><br />The Fifth Element in sci-fi and it's a comedy and it's a drama as well.  There are so many things going on in it.  Bruce Willis is a cab driver who happens to be in the right place at the wrong time or vice versa when Mila Jovich plunges through the roof of his cab.  Jovich is the "Perfect Being" left on Earth at one time to stop ultimate evil.  Her return is the result of a crash that left her body completely destroyed except for one hand curled around a contol lever.  She is rebuilt by the government in an effore to stop the ultimate evil that is now  plunging towards the Earth to destroy all of mankind.  Corbin Dallas (Willis) has been reactivated with the military to complete a mission to save the world.  Gary Oldman & Chris Tucker also star as ounlandish characters.  Filled with awesome visual effects and hilarious situations, I can't help but love The Fifth Element.  I understand why one would hate this movie because it could be very confusing and thus considered stupid or annoying if it wasn't watched in the proper frame of mind.  Besson outdid himself here.  Great filmaking.  One Hell of a film.  If you haven't seen it, do so, because it's like nothing you have ever seen before.  If you have and you didn't like it, watch it again.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />Dig it!</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ.html">A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ</a><br/><p>The quality of the movie is much better than any of the TV versions I have watched.  More importantly, you can hear everything being said, unlike on TV.  What small bits of nudity in this movie were not missed in the TV versions, however there are whole scenes often cut out on TV.  Love the movie.  This is a two disc set with bonus features which are intersting as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A26R4PDCZX5SOK.html">A26R4PDCZX5SOK</a><br/><p>5 of 5 stars for the sci-fi movie Fifth Element. OK, how do you summarize this movie? Sigh. OK, take three stone symbols which are a key to a protective weapon useable to keep away some nasty aliens who want to take the world, add in sexy girl (Milla Jovovich) who is a guardian of the weapon, a taxi driver (Bruce Willis), more aliens, some priests who know the secrets, an evil traitor working with the bad aliens and you have a really wild sci-fi story. Oh, it all takes place on the Earth in the dstant future. Did I mention the taxi moves in all 3 dimensions?<br /><br />An expansive vision of a whole different Earth with many different types of beings. Bruce Willis does a great job in the Sci-Fi movie. Really good story and well executed. Extensive special effects and really wild sets. This is a must see sci-fi movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>First time I watched this it was one of those three star things that you could take or leave. Yes it had all the elements (except the fifth) that make for a good shoot-um-up space thing. But I just looked at it as an action movie.<br /><br />For some reason this movie can grow on you and you find yourself anticipating the next move. Then you see things that you did not see the first time. Then you start to mouth the words. Soon this turns into a five star movie with a plot, good guys, bad guys, and good bad guys. Soon you start looking in your auto-wash to see if you left anything in there.<br /><br />An ancient thereat of dome looms over the earth. An ancient religion keeps the secret of the doom and the secret of the defense (the fifth element.) Prophecy turns into reality and it is up to Major Koeben Dallas (Bruce Willis) to find the fifth element and save the earth.<br /><br />Will he be able to do this and at what emotional expense?<br /><br />What is the fifth element?</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>Luc Besson's (The Professional; The Messenger) movie is a humor-laden sience fiction adventure film with motifs borrowed and cleverly adapted from virtually every other science fiction film that preceded it. The main plot seems to be a cohesive compilation of all of the individual short stories in the animated film &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; (i.e. the Lok-nar: the evil orb seking to destroy huamnity, the flying cab driver, Taarna the flying protectress who's brought in to save humanity, etc.) A lot of the futuristic stage design seems to be borrowed from Ridley Scott's &quot;Blade Runner.&quot;<br /><br /> Bruce Willis was o.k. in the film but seems to be just another version of his &quot;Die Hard&quot; character: &quot;This is how you negotiate!&quot; Although some reviewers found Chris Tucker to be annoying, that's exactly the character he was asked to play in this movie, an annoying, wimpy, effeminate, and talkative DJ. Mila Jojovich's role as Milou was irritating with the nonsensical baby da-da talk. The best performance was by Gary Oldman as the evil industrialist, Zorg.<br /><br /> Overall, the movie is a great action comedy sci-fi. The special effects along with the acting are pretty good to make one want to see this film more than once.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GB0HW46Y2EB.html">A1GB0HW46Y2EB</a><br/><p>From what I've gleaned from other reviewers, I guess I have the remastered version of "The Fifth Element" .  The picture and sound are both stunning -- better, I think, than anything I've seen on Blu-Ray.  The original DVD (non-Blu-Ray), which I also own, has a reputation for outstanding video quality and it does, but the BD is several levels better.  Some claim that the DVD is very nearly equivalent in quality to Blu-Ray and you can believe it until you have seen the remastered BD.<br /><br />As a film. this has to be the finest science-fiction comedy ever conceived.  (Yes, Space Balls is funny in places, but it's mainly for kids).  Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich are perfect in this, Chris Rock is generally funny but gets a bit tiring before the film has ended and Gary Oldman is superb as he is in practically everything in which he has appeared.  He tends to raise the level of all of his pictures -- from "Batman Begins" to even the "Harry Potter" he appears in.  And I can't count how many pictures I've seen the superb Ian Holm appearing in, whom I didn't at first recognize.  The  same thing was true of the earlier Peter Sellers pictures.</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>In 1997, French director Luc Besson (who directed &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; in 1990) wrote and directed an unusual sci-fi film entitled &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;.  (Also known as &quot;Le Cinqui&egrave;me &eacute;l&eacute;ment&quot; in French.)  The film begins with a scene that takes place around 1900 in Egypt, when an archeologist, Professor Pacoli (John Bluthal), and his assistant, Billy (Luke Perry), are studying pictograms and hieroglyphics in an ancient pyramid.  Suddenly, an assortment of strange beings, the Mondoshawans, arrive to remove the contents of the pyramid (the five elements), but tell a priest (John Bennett) who guards the pyramid that they will one day return when the five elements are needed.  The film then moves several hundred years into the future when the Earth is somewhat overpopulated and humanity is space-faring and technologically advanced.  A lowly cab driver, Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis), who is a retired army major, begins his day in his tiny studio apartment; but deep in space, a strange planet appears and is headed for Earth.  The Mondoshawans announce their return with the five elements to the delight of the current priest, Vito Cornelius (Ian Holm), but their ship is attacked.  The Earth's President Lindberg (Tom 'Tiny' Lister Jr.) tells Vito that it's now a military matter, then finds out that there is one survivor from the Mondoshawan ship.  From a few living cells, the survivor is clones back into existence and turns out to be a very strong, but beautiful woman (Milla Jovovich) that speaks a strange language.  She escapes and ends up crashing into the cab driven by Korben Dallas.  She is able to give Korben a name, Vito Cornelius, and he takes her to him.  Korben is then able to get her name: Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat, or Leeloo for short.  Korben leaves Leeloo with Vito Cornelius and his assistant David (Charlie Creed-Miles), but is later enlisted to help find four missing stones that are four of the five elements.  <p>&quot;The Fifth Element&quot; received a mixed response from American audiences when it opened in 1997 because many thought that it would be a typical Bruce Willis action film.  Hence, it received no Oscar nominations, but it won three C&eacute;sar Awards in France for Best Cinematography, Best Director (Luc Besson) and Best Production Design.  The film's very colorful set and costume designs, techno music and unusual characters were not what many Americans expected; but its story, which is often humorous, is both engaging and compelling.  One of the more unusual, but very funny characters in the film is the outrageous and famous D.J. Ruby Rod (Chris Tucker), who entertains millions with a wild radio show and gets to escort Korben during a cruise to the planet Flostin. There, Korben meets the famous alien Diva Plavalaguna (Ma?wenn Le Besco).  Other memorable characters from the huge cast include Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg (Gary Oldman), General Munro (Brion James) and Mr. Kim (Kim Chan).<p>Overall, I personally rate &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; with 5 out of 5 stars.  Clearly, the film is not for everyone, but if you enjoy French cinema and sci-fi, then chances are very good that you will enjoy the film very much.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KD8NJPZ01R37.html">A1KD8NJPZ01R37</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this movie and subsequently bought it twice for the superbit edition. I trotted out another disc player for the occasion and compared the two by switching inputs on my monitor. I thought the colors were yellowish on the first edition and brighter, but with less resolution. The superbit on the other hand was darker, but crisper and showed colors that seemed to be more true. The sound was a little different too, being more subdued during ambients (loudness) and a bit crisper.<p>As for the movie itself, Luc Besson made yet another masterpiece in addition to THE BIG BLUE and THE PROFESSIONAL. I didn't really like this movie when I first saw it (foolishly expecting a deep existential sci-fi), but later realized that this is a good solid-high-budget-feel-good-movie. This and STARSHIP TROOPERS will always be among my top 5.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z5WEA0KOMN9G.html">A2Z5WEA0KOMN9G</a><br/><p>Alot of people don't like this movie.  I can understand that.  It is a very irreverant look at Sci Fi movies.  However, I think it is a very funny movie and has some good action sequences.  Especially the cab chase at the beginning and the gun fight at the end.  The gun fight at the end reminded me of some of the Shadow Run games we used to play.  Gary Oldman was perfect as Zorg and Bruce Willis was perfect as Corbin Dallas.<p>Not one of the best movies out there, but certainly better than many others.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>Luc Besson is the man that gave us 'Leon', the stylised yet outstanding thriller, so his first real Hollywood picture is definitely a point of interest if nothing else.  It basically tells a story set against a futuristic background where ultimate evil is about to encompass Earth.  This is to be conquered by the so called 'Fifth Element' which takes the shape of the thin, red-haired Leeloo.  When she is rescused by an inner-city cab driver we just know that there's got to be a romantic subplot amidst the impressive battle and chase sequences.  The unusual couple soon cross paths with Cornelius (Ian Holm), who alone knows the importance of the fifth element.  Zorg (Gary Oldman) is the man that stands in their way.<p>Whilst this is basically just a pulp plot punctuated by explosions and screaming, it never pretends to be anything else.  There's also plenty of incidental pleasures, such as the extravagant costume designs and an enjoyably light performance from Bruce Willis.  Still, there are several incidental annoyances as well, especially the various outlandish characters that seem to be weird for the sake of it.  When it's giving us character farce with the likeable Willis and cutely effective Jovovich, it's very enjoyable.  Ditto in its impressive action seuquences.<p>This movie never pretends to be anything its not and therein lies its appeal as true blockbuster entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/AZQ7O73EAS3VI.html">AZQ7O73EAS3VI</a><br/><p>Probably the best Sci-fi ever. I love this one. t has comedy, action, story, everything necessary. Good actors, good characters, good everything. Watch it!!</p></br><a href="../users/A293HA28PN3VO4.html">A293HA28PN3VO4</a><br/><p>This remastered Blu-Ray version was watched on a Panasonic 42" Plasma and BD35K player. PQ 4/5 and AQ 5/5.<br /><br />I had not seen this film in a few years and found the visuals, and overarching storyline refreshing. The costume design and visual look of the film was particularly interesting and offered stylistic elements not seen on film since. The creatures seemed reminiscent of the Dark Crystal, which is one of my favorite films, so it felt familiar in that sense.<br /><br />The characters were relatable, and the "perfect" being was particularly touching as a "messenger" of sorts, in communicating our inherent habit of destroying ourselves, which of course, is one of the central themes of the film. Though not preachy, this characters' innocense and emphasis on this theme recentered the film to the core concepts effectively. Despite the fact that the film is filled with visually interesting effects and sound design/effects, this allows the film to remain humanistic. Many science fiction films fail in this regard, instead becoming overshadowed with technological aspects and special effects, but the Fifth Element stays true to its underlying message of the need and appreciation for love and the importance of humanity.<br /><br />Overall, this film was entertaining and action packed. However, I didn't give it a 5, because it seemed to lag in parts and some of the acting was overdone, in a way, that was too distracting, for me. Still for its visual elemements and overall theme, it was one of the most interesting sci-fi flicks I've seen. Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YC9XEDFKXPLK.html">A1YC9XEDFKXPLK</a><br/><p>First off, this dvd should be the reference standard to demonstrate the powers that be concerning the excellence in dvd picture and sound quality for this home video medium format!The colors are rich and daylight bright(you will be marvelling at LeeLoo's beautiful crystal blue eyes and bright burning orange hair)The images are crystal sharp and finely focused (and, yes I have seen this dvd played on several different makes and models of players and t.v.s; so, it's not just the hardware being used). The dialogue, surround sound effects, and music went beyond my expectations!<p>Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, and Gary Oldman are perfectly cast. The appearance of Chris Tucker is a memorable one.The gender bending/rock-star/d.j. celebrity character Ruby Rhod is a sheer tongue-in-cheek joke throwing it's innuendos at another well known &quot;Purple&quot;reigning musical artist in real life!<p>What's not to love about this movie ?There are good guys, bad guys, state-of-the-art special f/x, excellent music, and eye catching(yet sometimes confusing) sets/sceneries.The story or plot may not be profound but the rest of the above mentioned carry it off very well indeed...<p>P.S.--I highly recommend the soundtrack. The only error is that the chase scene,between Corben Dallas and the police,containing the salsa-ethnic sounding track sung in Arabic or Middle-Eastern vocals has been omitted !</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>Last night I watched "The Fifth Element" (1997) written /directed by Luc Besson for the first time - somehow I missed it and not being a huge fan of sci-fi, I did not search for it. Better later then never - the movie is pure and marvelous fun. It smiles at itself, does not take itself seriously and it is outrageously beautiful. It is a perfect mixture of Action / Adventure / Romance / Sci-Fi / Thriller/ with the comedy and the funny one, too. It seems to me that Steven Spielberg might have used some ideas of "The Fifth Element" in his great "Minority Report". The story's  five elements, four stones that represent water, earth, fire and air, and a perfect human creature - a girl, must together fight the absolute evil. Bruce Willis is as good as ever doing what he does best -fighting the bad guys (ugly scary aliens and very bad Gary Oldman with a hairdo you have to see to believe) and saving not just a hotel or one big city or even the great country but the Life as we know it. Luc Besson, the director, also wrote the story and the screenplay and I read that he had written it when he was 13. I think it is great that he adapted his own early writings because there is so much joy in it, the joy and happiness that only can be felt in one's childhood. The visuals, the sound, and the music to the film are terrific. The costumes created by another boy-genius, "enfant terrible" of Paris haute couture Jean-Paul Gaultier will grab your eye and attention - so  shockingly creative and unforgettable they are - the garment Milla was wearing in her first scene, for example.  Who would think the wide band-aids can look so sexy yet innocent yet crazy when wrapped around a beautiful girl? Bruce Willis's orange top that matches Milla's blinding red hair, absolutely hilarious outfits DJ Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker) was proudly wearing?  I am smiling now when I just think of them. Milla Yovovich possesses a rare exotic unusual beauty and the eyes, radiant and green like a new spring grass - she was a perfect choice for a perfect creature, the Mankind's only hope for survival in the eternal ferocious struggle between Good and Evil, Creativity and Destruction, Life and Death, Love and Hatred.</p></br><a href="../users/AE4JNORCLW8F6.html">AE4JNORCLW8F6</a><br/><p>I like sci-fi action thrillers and this one is near the top of my list. It wakes the senses, makes you think and keeps you entertained. There's enough going on to keep your mind active, while impressing the viewer with superb special effects. The acting and writing take the film above the typical eye candy found to be the focus of many sci-fi movies. The Ultimate Edition includes a second DVD that's well worth watching. It contains many interesting, entertaining bits that make The Fifth Element experience that much better. I highly recommend the film. Even if you're not a sci-fi fan, the movie has mass appeal that anyone can find to be a fun theatrical ride.</p></br><a href="../users/ACO20QL72D1E6.html">ACO20QL72D1E6</a><br/><p>... it has Bruce Willis heading a great cast, the ever struggle between good and evil, spectacular sets and costumes, gay humour and not the least Gary Oldman and the increadable Diva Dance....<br /><br />It has an intelligent script and Luc Besson has borrowed the best inspirations from the American movietraditions....</p></br><a href="../users/A34VV92TSLC37R.html">A34VV92TSLC37R</a><br/><p>The Fifth Element combines all good features of a great science fiction film.  Great special effects, a great story, great characters, cool villains, and good versus evil on a grand scale.  Bruce Willis is one of my all-time favorite actors, and he is on top of his game playing Korben Dallas, a retired military man who has resorted to driving a cab to make a living.  Everything changes for Korben when Lelu, played by Milla Jovovich, comes along to save the world from the coming evil invasion.  Lelu is the fifth element in a process that will stop evil from destroying our planet.  Gary Oldman plays Jean-Baptiste Zorg, who is one of my all-time favorite villains in any film.  Equal parts evil, funny, and dangerous, Oldman is the perfect villain for this film.  The action is over the top and so is the dialogue, but it all fits the film perfectly, and whatever cliches might pop up are totally welcomed by the viewer.  If you haven't seen The Fifth Element yet, you are missing out on possibly the best sci-fi movie of all-time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>If the intent in making "The Fifth Element" was to make a serious, intense science fiction/action movie along the lines of the "Terminator" movies or "Total Recall" - as its ad campaign seemed to indicate - then it can't really be considered a roaring success.  But if the intent was to create a fantastic sexy sci-fi adventure that's equal parts genuine comedy (actually greatly superior to much of the humor in movies billed under the comedy genre) and roller-coaster action thrills - owing as much to "Back to The Future", "Indiana Jones" and the less serious, more light-hearted James Bond adventures as to "T2" or "Total Recall" then it's succeededed smashingly.<br /><br />  In the futre, an entity called Evil has returned to Earth as it's apparantly done periodically, to try and gain control of something called the "Fifth Element" in order to wipe out life on Earth.  It falls to flying-cab driver Bruce Willis (in what I feel is his best role outside of an M. Night Shymalan film.  Yes, even better than John McClane in the first "Die Hard") to protect a strange, possibly alien girl named Leeloo (quirkily and lovably played by the scorching-hot Milla Jovovich of "Resident Evil" fame) who apparantly holds some kind of key to this Fifth Element.  Also starring Gary Oldman as one of the villains, who you just can't go wrong with.  With performances in movies like this, "Jesus", "Batman Begins" and "Bram Stoker's Dracula" under his belt I really think Oldman has proven himself as one of the world's greatest actors, and he's in top form here.<br /><br />  Innovative, dazzling visuals, larger-than-life action, great chases, perfectly placed comedy and Leeloo's penchant for quickly changing outfits wherever she happens to be at the moment - plus some surprisingly dramatic moments occasionally - combine to help make "The Fifth Element" an all-out winner.</p></br><a href="../users/A8M4WE1MT4R4O.html">A8M4WE1MT4R4O</a><br/><p>This movie threw me for a loop!  As i was watching the first hour of it i came so close to actually fast forwarding it.  I found the plot and the entire story hard to follow at times unless you were completely paying  attention 100% of the time.  Some of the characters were a tad bit  annoying, especially the character played by Milla Jovovich.  She reminded  me of a space aged &quot;Nell&quot; (the jodi foster character).  Her  ramblings were boderline intolerable at times, making it nauseating to  watch.  The scene where she is babeling to Bruce Willis, carrying on in  some unintelligable jargon was also hard to stomach.  &quot;Boom  boom&quot;, she came crashing through the roof of his cab, then Bruce tried  to communicate with her using her dialect and the whole thing just became  ridiculous to watch.  (Almost as ridiculous and tacky as the orange tank  top he wore throughout the film). Gary Oldman plays a swarthy &quot;bad-guy  type character&quot; wanting to gets his hands on the stones!  His  character too, is annoying and you find yourself asking, &quot;does that  plastic thing really need to be on the side of his head?&quot;<p>What saved  this movie for me was the performance by Chris Tucker and the cool opera  solo by the blue creature. As soon as she appeared on screen, emenating a  blue glow and belting out a haunting operatic falsetto, my outlook began to  change on this seemingly forgettable film.  To make matters more strange,  Chris Tucker's character began to come to life as well.  He added comic  relief to the fullest extent.  I found myself barking out in fits of  laughter over his psychotic performance.  The movie quickened up it's  sluggish pace towards the end, and bam!  everything started to fall into  place in lightning speed.  Even Gary Oldman's character somehow became more  interesting to watch.<p>So The Fifth Element (saved by the grace of Chris  Tucker) was not a complete loss.  With an unforgetable classic scene by  that opera singin' blue thing, it's worth owning for that alone. I just  wish they could re-do the first half of the film!</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Region A, B, C<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50<br />Running time: 2:05:53<br />Movie size: 37,710,600,192 bytes<br />Disc size: 38,946,438,756 bytes<br />Average video bit rate: 27.88 Mbps<br />Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (up-converted from 16-bit master) English<br />LPCM 5.1 4608Kbps 16-bit English<br />DD 5.1 French<br />Subtitles: English / English  SDH / French / Spanish / Portuguese / Chinese / Thai<br />Trivia Fact Track</p></br><a href="../users/A84UFSF2SZS2W.html">A84UFSF2SZS2W</a><br/><p>At best, Milla Jovovich is cute here.

The plot is not necessary to elaborate upon. It is superfluous. This film is not worth your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>This review is for the new &quot;The Fifth Element:Ultimate Edition&quot;.<br />This new two disc set includes a wonderfully crisp transfer and an extra disc full of extras aimed to please.<br />I recall viewing this movie on VHS when it first came out and I am amazed at the difference in picture and especialy sound quality.I recall on the tape having a devil of a time understanding what the shape shifting alien marauders-for-hire were saying,but in this edition I understand every syllable quite clearly.<br />This is a movie I never tire of even after repeated viewings.It's one of those films that the best thing you can do is just sit back and let IT do the driving.It's a wild space/earth/alien/armageddon/pure evil vs pure good high adrenaine romp that never lets up when it gets going.<br />Cab driver Dallas(Willis) is an ex special forces member who is suddenly thrust into becoming the ersatz guardian of Leeloo(Jovovich) the pictures' title.It's a race against time to make sure she accomplishes her mission.....to save earth.The back story and the colourful characters that we meet along the way propel the movie along without stopping for a breath.<br />The main drawback of this set,and it isn't exactly a minor one,is its' issuance  ONLY in DTS.There is NO Dolby 5:1 surround or any other sound options available at all in the menu which is highly unusual, as opposed to any DVD I've encountered so far which usually has mulitple options thereof.So please be warned to make sure your DVD player is able to play DTS encoded audio,as some older models may not be able to.This is something I have to manually adjust to everytime I play it,which can be annoying.<br />In concluding if the only-in-DTS sound is a problem then you will want to give this set a by-pass,which is why I have given this set a three and half star rating when it should have been higher.<br />But if the sound is no obstacle I recommend you pick up this highly entertaining two disk set which is the only way to own this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UBVJEV1LLS7.html">A38UBVJEV1LLS7</a><br/><p>I love this film, and the fact that it collected so much plaque is puzzling to me. Tucker especially makes the movie which is filled with fun, wacky characters from the "far reaches of the galaxy." The plot was far-fetched, but it's a Science-Fiction picture for crying out loud!! I laughed and cried (not literally but you get the idea). A must see, but according to other reviews, not one you're likely too.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KAR9G699RM56.html">A1KAR9G699RM56</a><br/><p>When someone created a movie called the Fifth Element, you'd think they'd also keep in mind the need for an entertaining plot (important film element), which was partially there, and good characters (another element that was scarce and fleeting.)<br /><br />The story is about an alien race who has five elements which, when positioned properly, save the world, but the fifth element can be switched out for evil and cause the obvious ever-looming end of the world.<br /><br />Really though, after you've calmly accepted rabbi-alien coordination and Chris Tuckers outrageous character, which is similar to most of his other ones, then you've probably finished the movie.  You may ask yourself why, and that comes down to two reasons: first, Willis' character does make you care, and the other annoying characters, from alien to human, are just pretty annoying.  On the positive side I can say there were a few humorous parts, but they did not last long, and honestly are not very memorable.<br /><br />So, if you just have to see every sci-fi movie out there, then this is yours, but if you have the chance to avoid then I suggest it, because I'm saving you from important missing elements.</p></br></body></html>

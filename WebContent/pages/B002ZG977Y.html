Raised by the fisherman, Perseus was treated like a son despite his mysterious beginnings. But when his adoptive family is killed by Hades (Ralph Fiennes) in the midst of the Greek city Argos' war against Zeus (Liam Neeson), Perseus finds out that he's a demigod, the son of Zeus. Rather than joining the gods in their war with the humans, Perseus joins the humans in an effort to find out how destroy Hades' Kraken, a legendary destroyer of cities, and in turn seek revenge for the death of his family.<br /><br />I'm fairly certain that I'm not the only one who, when this went into production, wondered why they chose to remake a 1981 film rather than creating a movie based on the hugely popular God of War video game series. I guess part of my reticence to this idea has to be my general disinterest in remakes, but at the same time one has to admit that video game movies generally fare worse than remakes as a rule. Then the casting started poring in for this remake/reimagining, and I started to get a bit excited about it. Sam Worthington proved his mettle as the best part of Terminator: Salvation and did a great job in Avatar, and anytime you have Liam Neeson and/ or Ralph Fiennes in a movie, especially together (they're first time on screen together since Schindler's List) you're most likely up for a good time. To fill out the brilliance on screen, Louis Leterrier was set to helm the project having done movies that have ranged from merely good (Transporter, The Incredible Hulk) to transcendent (Unleashed or Danny the Dog). Needless to say I was more than slightly interested to see what this would all lead to.<br /><br />While you might expect this film to completely re-imagine the film, but rather even down to the special effects the films has a much more old school feel to it. This is both one of the strengths of the movie and a detriment to the movie as well. While it utilizes all of the special effects at it's disposal, it still lumbers like an unweildy beast at times. The mix of CGI with the look of practical effects doesn't look as good as other movies that have come out recently, and other creations don't mix well with the practical creations. Overall, though, Leterrier knows how to work an action sequence, and the action really does work, even if the ending is slightly anticlimactic. The most disappointing aspect of the movie though is the 3-D transfer which doesn't appear to be in 3-D except the very beginning of the movie, other than that the cost of the 3-D surcharge is asking a lot of viewers, and proves just to be nothing more than a cash making gimmick by Warner Bros.<br /><br />With all of the great actors that were involved in this movie, the acting is strangely subpar. Ralph Fiennes hams it up as god of the underworld Hades as does Jason Flemyng as former King of Argos Arcisius, and Liam Neeson isn't given much to do as uber-god Zeus. Sam Worthington is surprisingly flat as the demigod Perseus. Most of the time Worthington appears to be bored or just not even trying. Of everyone on the cast the most believable actors are Pete Postelthwaite as Perseus adoptive father Spyros, and his demise early on in the movie is truly lamentable, and Gemma Arterton as Io, the ageless beauty who helps lead Perseus to his destiny of defeating the gods.<br /><br />I'm not saying the movie's horrible, this isn't Transformers 2, but it's also not Avatar either. All in all it's still a fun movie worth a look-see, but it's definitely not the best that the cast and crew could possibly have to offer. I enjoyed myself at the theater for this one (even if I was annoyed by paying the 3-D surcharge for nothing), and I suggest you give it a shot. You might find yourself slightly disappointed, but you'll probably still have fun as well.<br /><br />3/5</p></br><a href="../users/A2KW2KWKABNYNO.html">A2KW2KWKABNYNO</a><br/><p>If there was ever a film that needed to be remade, then this was it. Sure, the original was good for whoever watched it growing up as a kid in the 80s, but by today's standard the movie is little more than a joke. Fortunately, this film will be relevant for much longer than the original, and Sam Worthington does a much better job than Harry Hamlin.<br /><br />The story follows the same basic premise of the original, with a few tweaks, so it's still an ancient road-trip movie to save the local princess, except this time the film adds a heavy amount of more motivation for Perceus. This time, he's driven by revenge, and his desire to be more man than God. And in this sense, while the story take a little bit too much of the screen time, and there are lulls, the story does a serviceable job creating a cohesive narrative that moves from setpiece to setpiece. The characters are a bit less serviced, and by the time the movie is finished you only really get to know Perseus. Thus when a character dies, you're a lot less inclined to care, since there's a great disconnect between the emotion of the film and its audience. Thus, for me at least, it was simply about the action.<br /><br />And the action is pretty good. Since the larger creatures are just so fantastical it was hard for me to get into those scenes as much, but anytime Sam Worthington has a sword I'm happy. But still, the Medusa scene is one of the film's highlights, and apart from the fact that he looks like a sea monster version of Godzilla, the Kraken does provide a lot of great destruction. Plus, it gives the line that will forever live in the annals of film history in, "RELEASE THE KRAKEN!"<br /><br />Overall, Clash of the Titans is a mostly satisfying B-movie action matinee, and a great way to kill an afternoon. It may have its problems apart from the action, and I'm not exactly thrilled at a possible sequel, it was a mostly enjoyable two hours, and that's all I can ask from a movie nowadays.</p></br><a href="../users/ARFCORBCTKX1J.html">ARFCORBCTKX1J</a><br/><p>It's difficult to know where to start when defending a film that's been almost universally excoriated. Perhaps the beginning is the best place.<br /><br />For me, the beginning was watching Ray Harryhausen's films as a kid. I saw many in first-run. "Earth vs. the Flying Saucers" at the age of 9 was the first.<br /><br />The last was "Clash of the Titans", released at the same time as "Raiders of the Lost Ark". I saw both on the same night in DC, and it was obvious Ray had gone out with a whimper, rather than a bang. "Raiders" handily eclipsed it.<br /><br />The problem with Ray Harryhausen's films was that his stop-motion sequences were /always/ the best things in them. No major studio understood how Harryhausen's effects could "plus" films that already had good scripts, acting, and direction. Only Charles Schneer at Columbia saw the potential of Harryhausen's work, but he could never get the money needed to realize that potential. *<br /><br />Harryhausen's films are a mixed bag of mediocrity. Some of them have good scripts (notably Beverley Cross's for "Jason" and "Titans"), but the direction varies from competent to poor. (Desmond Davis's helming of "Titans" is notably snooze-inducing.) The acting is similarly variable; no one should be obliged to watch Kerwin Matthews in /anything/. (It's hard to believe that Danny Kaye, who'd already made fantasy films, turned down "Gulliver". **) The films /surrounding/ Harryhausen's effects only occasionally approached the imagination and sheer stylishness of those effects. ***<br /><br />On the (very!) plus side, four of those films have Bernard Herrmann scores, "Sinbad" and "Gulliver" being of especially high quality. (Note the praise of "Sinbad"'s score in the Wikipedia article.) And "Titans" has romantic, genuinely thrilling music by Laurence Rosenthal.<br /><br />"Titans" is, to paraphrase King Arthur, "a rather silly film" (though it needn't have been). It went on to become a "kamp klassik", and there was a time when TBS ran it once a month.<br /><br />The producers (and director) of the remake were mostly people who'd seen the original as kids, and had genuine affection for it. So why is it such a bad film?<br /><br />Well... IT ISN'T. The Wikipedia article reveals an ambitious plan to create a mash-up of mythologies from multiple cultures. However clever this was, it would have thoroughly confused audiences. So the remake is principally a rethinking of the original.<br /><br />The original stuck closely to the original myth of Perseus and the Gorgon. Its changes were primarily additions to pad the story. The remake veers widely from the myth, in particular having Perseus found and raised by a fisherman, with his mother Dana? dying.<br /><br />The remake's most-important change is the introduction -- as the central dramatic conflict -- of the conceit that the pagan gods continued their existence only because humans loved and worshipped them. This isn't new; it appears in "Excalibur", "Dragonslayer" (Why is there no Blu-ray of this film, with its wonderful Oscar-nominated Alex North score?), and likely other films. Though a demi-god, Perseus opposes the old order, and wants the gods to butt out of human affairs.<br /><br />The script -- which borrows much from Beverley Cross's original -- is terse and generally free of Dumb Stuff (though the brief appearance of a character from the original, which draws a huge laugh, should have been deleted). The acting is acceptable, with Neeson and Fiennes sensibly underplaying.<br /><br />The problem is the direction. Though the remake moves along crisply, without feeling rushed, Louis Leterrier -- as too many other directors -- has little understanding of how to adjust the pace of a film. He moves flatly from scene to scene, without building tension -- then releasing and rebuilding it. I advise him to listen to the first act of "Die Walk&uuml;re", a perfect example of how this is done musically.<br /><br />Ray Harryhausen's animation reflects this belief in the "slow build". Perseus's confrontation with Medusa (a superb piece of stop-motion animation, the only genuinely good thing in the original) takes its time getting started. It's a cat-and-mouse game that ratchets up the tension. The remake is almost all continuous action, without any rise/fall or give-and-take. This is particularly disappointing, as CGI lets the animators do almost anything they like, without the restrictions of manipulating physical models. This sequence would have been much better had it copied the /style/ of the original.<br /><br />Perhaps the oddest difference between the original and remake is female nudity -- the PG original had it, the PG-13 remake doesn't! In the original, we see a naked Dana? suckling Perseus, and both she and Andromeda are shown "butt"-nekkid.<br /><br />"Clash of the Titans" is not a bad film. Like its precursor, it's silly fun, and can be enjoyed on that level.<br /><br />* It's decidedly ironic that Tinseltown -- the world's leading purveyor of fantasy -- never saw the potential of fantasy films, largely relegating them to B movies and programmers. "The Wizard of Oz" was supposedly framed as a dream, on the assumption audiences wouldn't accept it as "reality". Yet in "Dark Victory", Bette Davis dies quickly and painlessly of an unspecified brain disorder. I find that considerably more "fantastic" than the land of Oz.<br /><br />** "The Three Worlds of Gulliver" is the best adaptation of the novel I've seen (the Robert Halmi TV version included), because it doesn't ignore the satire at the center of the story.<br /><br />*** This is perhaps overstating the case, as even "mediocre" films can have their own styles, and be entertaining. But Ray Harryhausen's outstanding work repeatedly throws into relief the overall weakness of his films. You keep thinking "If only the acting and directing had been better..."</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>"Clash of the Titans" is a truly amazing film -- never before have I seen a movie that is so BUSY, and yet so staggeringly DULL.<br /><br />This stupid movie was apparently made to cash in on the wild success of 300, but it pretty much missed everything that made that movie enjoyable. Instead, this remake of the classic cult film is full of everything and nothing -- Louis Leterrier crams it with horrible acting, endless CGI, and an obnoxiously preachy plot that ends up being brain-bleedingly boring.<br /><br />A fisherman finds a floating coffin, which holds a dead princess and a still-living baby. He adopts the child, Perseus (Sam Worthington), and raises him as well -- until the god Hades (Ralph Fiennes) destroys Perseus' family and fishing boat. He's marched to the city of Argos, where he sees the king and queen declare war on the gods...<br /><br />... only to have Hades proclaim that if Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) is not sacrificed within ten days, the kraken will destroy Argos. A mysterious woman named Io (Gemma Arterton) tells Perseus that he is actually the son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), and is the only hope of slaying the kraken and saving Argos.<br /><br />Honestly, the story of Perseus is one of the awesomest, most movieworthy stories in Greek mythology -- you've got a demigod hero, a sea monster, a flying horse, and a snake-headed creature that turns people to stone. But apparently, THAT story isn't good enough for the people in Hollywood. They even mock the original movie in one scene involving the mechanical owl Bubo.<br /><br />Instead director Leterrier crams all sorts of weird random stuff into the movie -- it's a constant onslaught of giant scorpions, CGI monsters, djinni, and witches who look like Guillermo del Toro discards. The plot feels skeletal and bloated at the same time, with horribly silly dialogue ("It is death who should be afraid of us!") and dozeworthy action scenes.<br /><br />Even worse, the screenwriters seem hell-bent on pushing their own theological philosophy on us ("God sucks and ruins everything, so don't worship him") NON-STOP. There's scene after scene of "We hate the gods! Gods are awful! Let's stupidly anger them even though they're incredibly powerful!"... only for them to undermine their own message in the last reel.<br /><br />And really, how can you go wrong when you have Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes in your movie, playing GODS? Well, you can cast the bland lump that is Sam Worthington as your lead, a pouting prettyboy who brings no charisma to his role, giving Neeson nothing to do except throw divine tantrums and Fiennes nothing to do except slink around being vaguely sinister (since a god of death HAS to be evil, right? WRONG!). As for Gemma Arterton, she just sort of wanders in and out of the story, serving as a source of convenient information.<br /><br />"Clash of the Titans" would be better titled "Flush of the Titans" -- a reeking lump of brainless cinema that stupefies even as it preaches. The original is flawed, but infinitely superior to this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2<br /><br />The original version of "Clash of the Titans" was an infinitely entertaining - and still fondly remembered - piece of early `80s kitsch comprised of one part corn to two parts cheese.  It was further distinguished by having a number of acting legends of both stage and screen (i.e., Lawrence Olivier, Maggie Smith) slumming their way through the project - and obviously having the time of their professional lives doing so.<br /><br />The 2010 version, directed by Louis Leterrier, trades in star power and campiness for improved special effects and a more straightforward action-movie approach to the material (though Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes do appear as Zeus and Hades, respectively).<br /><br />Sam Worthington stars as Persius, the demi-god son of Zeus, who leads the humans in a war against the gods, whom he blames for the deaths of his adoptive parents and little sister.  Persius also must face-down and defeat the mighty Kracken, a terrifying, indestructible beast that serves as the gods' ultimate weapon against the people.<br /><br />It's all very Saturday-matinee juvenilia in spirit and tone, but the pacing is swift, the special effects impressive, and the various and sundry monsters and creatures sufficiently imaginative and larger-than-life to make us suspend our disbelief, if only for the duration.<br /><br />Good fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EARN5PUVIF1S.html">A1EARN5PUVIF1S</a><br/><p>This remake of the Ray Harryhausen classic offers state-of-the-art special effects and a brisk pace to move the story along.<br /><br />Unfortunately characterization suffers.  And Sam Worthington may be a good actor, but he looks more like a soccer player or a marine here than a son of the gods.<br /><br />It appears that most of the budget for the film went to the special effects, which are admittedly pretty special.  The Kraken, giant scorpions, Pegasus, and Medusa in particular are something to see, a vast improvement over the charming but limited Harryhausen stop-motion creations of decades past.<br /><br />But the big-name cast is pretty limited: Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes carry some weight as Zeus and Hades, but the only other name players here aside from Worthington are Gemma Arterton and Pete Postlethwaite.  The original "Clash" boasted, of course, Laurence Olivier, Burgess Meredith, Harry Hamlin, Ursula Andress, and numerous others.<br /><br />I deducted one star because of the skimpiness of the extras on this disc: just some alternate and additional scenes, but no director's commentary or, more damaging, no "making of" featurette showing how some of the eye-popping effects were created.<br /><br />Still, fans of Olympian spectacle will find plenty of eye-candy on display if little food for thought.  Worth a rental, at least -- maybe a purchase if a "tenth anniversary" DVD comes along with more extras.</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>A long time ago there were big, chaotic, uncontrollable gods, the Titans, who ruled the Earth and gave birth to new gods who destroyed them and created man, in order to gain power from their worship.  But men, being men, resented the arbitrary whims of the gods and it was inevitable they'd fight back.  Hades, the god of the underworld, hit upon a plan to bring fear into the hearts of men so they'd worship again.  He'd release the Kraken, a giant sea monster, and destroy a city, but at the same time gain enough power to overpower Zeus, the king of the gods.  It turned out, though, that a forgotten and resentful son of Zeus happened to be hanging around and had a motive and enough pluck to fight back.  (If you've seen <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003HARV3Y">Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief</a>, or if you've read the book you'll notice that it's nearly the same story, with slight variations, but the movie this is based on came first, and the Greek myths both movie and the book are loosely based on came long before that).<br /><br />While sacrificing story to CGI, this update of the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZD3V10">Clash of the Titans</a> manages to be entertaining enough for a popcorn family night, but not enough to come anywhere near the inventiveness and excitement of the original. Sure the original had its kitchy moments - with celebrities playing the preening gods - but it felt fresh.  I remember begging to see it as a kid when it first came out and wanting to go back right away - I even had the board game based on the movie.  This one, by contrast, feels highly derivative and only adds to the original an intensity that detracts from the characters and computer generated effects that are only partially convincing.  In the original the effects weren't convincing either, but they were clever and inventive and it felt like an illusion, it gave the feeling of a story being told, rather than a dream pretending to be real.<br /><br />The opening sequence, that tells the story of the gods against the backdrop of the constellations, was my favorite part of the film.  After that, the portrayal of the gods by Liam Neeson as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes as Hades, who both brought the required gravitas to the mix; Jason Flemyng as Calibos and Mads Michelson as Draco were also top notch, and managed to import feeling and plausibility into some implausible and over the top hokey dialogue.  Sam Worthington, unfortunately, didn't convince me as Perseus, especially given a performance that was even more wooden and less nuanced than his performance in Avatar, where at least it seemed to fit the situation.<br /><br />The action is far too busy, for the most part; too much was going on during a fight scene to have much more than a sense of chaos mixed with awe and tension, when what is needed and was sorely lacking here is a stronger sense of identification with who is being attacked by whom and what is at stake in every moment of the battle scenes.  Still, on the whole, I have to say that while I wasn't overwhelmed and on the edge of my seat I was enjoying it.  My wife and kids, who watched it with me, seemed to have fun as well, and afterwards gave it a tentative thumbs up: "yeah, that was okay, Dad."  If you don't go into it expecting much, you won't be disappointed and may even enjoy it.  If you do, check out the original, which is much more fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Does anyone else feel that the "Release the Kraken" line has been used way too much in all the TV adds and trailers? Other than those three words, I was quite looking forward to Clash of the Titans. I have never seen the 1981 version, even though I tried renting the Blu-ray prior to seeing this remake, but it's not in stock anywhere. Those looking for high art are at the wrong movie, but if you want some B movie popcorn fun, this might do the trick. Parts of it reminded me of the mess that was 10,000 B.C., but it never quite gets that bad.<br /><br />The acting is slightly better than I had read about from critics. Sam Worthington is okay, though a bit too bland. He was much better in Terminator: Salvation and Avatar. I'm still not sure if this guy has star quality or not. Liam Neeson (Zeus) and Ralph Fiennes (Hades) both turn in performances worthy of a movie with better writing, but they manage to do the most with the average script. Same goes for Mads Mikkelsen (Draco). As far as the ladies go, Gemma Arterton (lo) and Alexa Devalos (Andromeda) are nice to look at for sure, but Arterton's character is more interesting, mainly because she is actually given things to do.<br /><br />Movies like this live and die by the CGI. About half of it works, but some is very mediocre. Nothing reaches the depths of The Scorpion King look in The Mummy Returns, but at least that has the excuse of coming out in 2001. Which leads me to the 3-D. If given the choice of 2-D or 3-D, I don't mind paying double the price for this popular format, but I'm glad I listened to the critics and other movie goers who have said that the rushed 3-D job here stinks. At least Alice in Wonderland had a lot of time put into it's upconvert. I heard they spent only two months or so on Clash of the Titans, leaving the film looking too dark and turning the action scenes into nothing more than headache starters. Take it from me, I saw it in 2-D, saved five bucks, and thought it looked good.<br /><br />I love Greek mythology, with all the cool creatures that go along with it, and I'm currently hacking and slashing my way through God of War III, so Clash of the Titans was fully entertaining in my eyes, but this movie needed more effort in the script and CGI department. Still, it's fun and worth seeing on the BIG screen. In fact, I'm not sure if they should have made this movie any less silly. Perhaps that's exactly what it's suppose to be.<br /><br />Perseus may be the son of Zeus here, but Kratos will always be my God slayer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D0PJFW2VY8G.html">A2D0PJFW2VY8G</a><br/><p>I'm old enough to remember the original Clash of the Titans which was released in 1981 and when I heard there would be a remake I had the same opinion I often do i.e. what's the point? There are so many aspiring scriptwriters out there that you'd think Hollywood would have no need to remake classic films or indeed Americanise popular hits from world cinema, I mean where's the originality? That rant aside I approached Clash of the Titans with the hope that it would improve on the original, which has its moments but was by no means a masterpiece.<br /><br />Both Clash of the Titans films are very loosely based on the Greek myth of Perseus, slayer of the gorgon Medusa who also saved Princess Andromeda from being sacrificed to a sea monster. The film actually opens with some background to the myths that told of the Titans that were overthrown by their sons, three brothers Zeus (Liam Neeson), Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Poseidon (Danny Huston). While Zeus became ruler of the heavens and created mankind, Poseidon took charge of the oceans leaving a Hades (tricked by Zeus) as reluctant ruler of the Underworld. The film switches to the tale of Perseus (Sam Worthington) who is found by a fisherman, Spyros (Pete Postlethwaite) in a floating coffin at sea when he is just a baby. Spyros raises the child as his own and when Perseus is grown up he faces a fight for his own survival and that of the kingdom of Argos that foolishly renounces the gods. Zeus turns to Hades for help and the god of the Underworld insists he will release the feared Kraken to destroy Argos in ten days unless they sacrifice Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos). Perseus becomes the leader of a quest to find the means to destroy the Kraken and save Argos from the retribution of the gods.<br /><br />Having appeared in Terminator Salvation (2009) and Avatar (2009) recently it seems Sam Worthington is drawn to the potential box office hits and in Clash of the Titans he gets to traverse the ancient historical path of Russell Crowe in Gladiator (2000). After the background to the rise of the gods to power the film quickly moves onto the mysterious origins of Perseus found in a coffin at sea with his dead mother alongside him. Though the kindly fisherman, Spyros, may have suspicions about the child's origins he raises him as his own regardless and the family continue a seemingly carefree existence. When Perseus is grown up the family are at sea and witness a statue of Zeus being felled along the coast. The culprits are immediately made to suffer when Hades appears and kills the bulk of the soldiers as well as Perseus' family. Perseus is taken to the kingdom of Argos where the ruling monarch King Kepheus (Vincent Regan) and Queen Cassiopeia (Polly Walker) believe Cassiopeia and their daughter Andromeda are superior in beauty to Aphrodite. Having been granted permission by Zeus to bring havoc to Argos, Hades soon appears and begins killing soldiers and ageing the boastful Queen. He realises that Perseus is a demi god and we soon learn of his background as the son of Zeus. Andromeda is then put forward as a sacrifice in ten days otherwise Hades will unleash the Kraken to destroy the kingdom. Argos turns to Perseus for help and a band of soldiers join him on a quest that forms the high point of the film.<br /><br />Aware of his origin, Perseus refuses to welcome his heritage as a demi god, refusing aid that the gods send him though welcoming the advice and support of Io (Gemma Arterton), a woman who cannot age having been punished by the gods after refusing their advances. It is Io that tells Perseus of his origins and helps train him for the difficult encounters on his quest, most notably the fight with the Gorgon Medusa whose stare turns anything to stone but her severed head is considered the best way to defeat and kill the Kraken. Though far from faithful to the myth of Perseus, Clash of the Titans still has nods to many of the Greek tales. In one scene Perseus leads the warriors into the Underworld where they buy passage from the ferryman Charron who takes them across the murky waters to the home of Medusa. The Gorgon herself isn't as fearsome as I recalled in the original, she is portrayed as a beautiful woman here though one that has been cursed by the gods and that serpent tail with matching hissing hair does little to make her appealing. That said, in the 1981 version I vaguely recall that she wasn't as easy on the eye, a more apt punishment for gods jealous of her beauty when she was still human. The battle with Medusa is probably the best bit of the film; the soldiers gathered not heeding the warnings of facing the Gorgon by staring down and not meeting her gaze. The death toll in the exchange is horrific but as per the myth Perseus does triumph in the end.<br /><br />Watching Clash of the Titans I found some moments very appealing, mostly the combat scenes but by the end I was left feeling disappointed. The film isn't particularly faithful to the myth of Perseus. The wonderful winged horse, Pegasus, is encountered by Perseus as a herd of such fine horses rather than emerging from the beheaded body of Medusa while the concluding segment with Perseus' battle with the Kraken doesn't ring true either. It was a sea monster in the myth that Perseus defeated and in the aftermath he married Andromeda. Clash of the Titans has two endings, one appears faithful to the myth but the one I watched was very different. Perseus became a king in the myths but despite his lineage in the film our hero has no desire to be a king or a god in Olympus. There is just enough time at the end for a spot of romance, one that overcomes death, which is always handy but even as the end credits roll you'll be feeling that's a very abrupt way to conclude a film.<br /><br />Clash of the Titans has some good moments but as a whole it's a pretty weak affair. Greek and Roman history is a popular theme for Hollywood at the moment but since Gladiator the standard has been pretty poor and this latest version of Clash of the Titans, sadly, has done nothing to redress that balance.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>The original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q7ZOL2">Clash of the Titans</a> is perhaps mostly remembered for its sheer corniness.

There was little pretense of creating a dramatic masterpiece, and much focus on action and thrills, both of which were delivered well, aided by an excellent score. The film starts somewhat slowly but soon ramps up and moves along nicely, and as a simple piece of entertainment I enjoyed it.<br /><br />COTT doesn't hew very closely to the real Greek myths, but so what. Neither did the original, and I found this version much less hokey and much more enjoyable. Fiennes and Neeson add some dramatic weight to the proceedings (if not overly much), and Worthington contributes his two sides: dogged determination beset by underlying fear and uncertainty, and the curious puppy on the way to doggedness. Which is perfect, as we wouldn't want too much real acting to remind us how ridiculous this whole exercise is.<br /><br />The effects are exemplary, which is the key to all the fun, and the sound effects and Djawadi's crackling score complete the visceral thrills. There are some fine action scenes, especially in Medusa's cave and the final Kraken battle, and the almost flawless blu-ray transfer does them justice. This was just plain fun to watch on a good set-up; crank the volume on your surround sound and prepare to be floored by good old goofy b-movie intensity. With an a-movie budget.<br /><br />I didn't expect much coming in and got more than I'd hoped for, and I might even watch this again some day.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>My wife and I are the biggest geeks for the original CLASH OF THE TITANS (1981). Though we cannot get out to the theater anymore, I waited endlessly to see this 2010 version.<br /><br />This film is fun, no doubts there. Fun in every way, subtle in its humor, light on the gross violence - and Sam Worthington as Perseus is the casting glory of the century. That man is one gorgeous hunk, and you never feel he's Hollyphony like Russell Crowe or Mel Gibson (who is Hollyloony). His understated, sweet performance as Perseus-I'm-Just-A-Regular-Greek-Man totally blasts Mark Hamil's original Perseus to the stars.<br /><br />Aside from the idiot 3D craze - CLASH OF THE TITANS has been visually ruined by it as have many other films - it is in itself murky and difficult to watch at times. The beginning drags like my mother-in-law's caboose, a yawner right out of the original DUNE. Too much yapping ... like my reviews.<br /><br />The basic stuff of the film is awesome. I was very smitten with the Djinns, and had it not been for the double pleasure of the beautiful Worthington and the equally beautiful Nicholas Hoult (A SINGLE MAN, see my review) as Eusebius, I'd have been in love with them. Desert sorcerers, cool! Oil drillers need those guys.<br /><br />The CGI was a bit of a yawn. From Hades' HARRY POTTER black smoke to Gorgon Medusa's face, the CGI frankly sucked. How could they do this movie, at an hour and a half, and still fail the CGI? CGI, as I always say, can be the crowning glory or the undoing of a film. Here it is the undoing, sadly. We were so busy saying how bad it was, I had to go back later for a second viewing to catch the action and dialogue.<br /><br />The cinematography was somewhat amateurish - the live action scenes are mostly shot in a little box of a stage, I know. That, plus bad CGI, is no good combination. It shows terribly here, and I think it takes a lot away from this otherwise great film. What a pity. It's like Eusebius being turned to stone by Medusa.<br /><br />Pete Postlethwaite as Perseus' adopted father is brilliant and wonderful. The whole cast, which I will not list here, is great! That is why I'm so angered by the technical crapola this film dishes out so carelessly. I will add, Liam Neeson as Zeus, all three minutes of him, is the coolest thing I've seen in ages!<br /><br />What I do love about this film is its theological message (yes, it does have one). It's the old query: Where is the Spirit in the Sky when we need it? Why are we forsaken? Why pray, why did my fields dry up and my island sink a few feet? It emphasizes the gods' need for our prayers, yet they are so stingy and cruel to us. It's a powerful message not conveyed in the 1981 film. It has a double meaning: the end of the old Greek pagan world and the beginning of, I don't know, maybe Judaic monotheism.<br /><br />This is an excellent film for kids, I think. They should see this and know its historical context, its meanings for the people who first heard the tales. Just be ready to get them eyeglasses prescriptions when they are done watching this.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>I was a big fan of the 1981 movie Clash of the Titans. It had everything I loved: action, excitement, Greek mythology! It was a great film for its time and still holds up at least somewhat today. Sure, the effects have aged, but that's to be expected.<br /><br />It was also a movie that pushed me even more into my budding interest in Greek mythology; an interest which has continued to this very day. Heck, I got quite an interest in mythology in general and even took a course in it when I was in high school (and designed my own pantheon of gods for extra credit).<br /><br />So I went to the new version with a certain set of expectations. I wanted to see gods, Medusa, Calibos, the Kraken and some good ole fashioned swords and sandals combat. Anything further, like a good story line and decent acting, were to be considered nice bonuses.<br /><br />With those moderate exceptions in mind, this movie delivers quite well. Gods? Check. Medusa? Check. Calibos? The Kraken? Oh, definite check. Mind you, the gods are largely unnamed and don't do a lot, Medusa isn't as interesting as she was in the original film, Calibos goes by a different name in all but one sentence and the Kraken... well, actually still looks pretty impressively Kraken-esque.<br /><br />The plot is pretty basic: Queen Danae (a name never mentioned in the movie, which sucked cause I used to know a girl with that name), gives birth to Perseus, the son of Zeus. Her husband is a bit irked by this and dumps her and her son into the sea. They're recovered but Danae is already dead. Perseus is raised by the fisherman who found them. The boy grows up to be a man played by Sam Worthington who watches the gods kill his adopted family, sees Hades threaten Argos and eventually gets caught up in a war between the men and the gods.<br /><br />The plot is pretty basic, and frankly seems a bit more basic than it was in the original film. The presence of a Burges Meredith character is also sorely missed (though the owl, Bupo, puts in a brief appearance), as the replacement, Draco, handles Perseus' training a little too quickly to be satisfying. I also found Sam Worthington's performance to be less interesting than his performance in Avatar, and given how basic that was, that's saying something.<br /><br />The effects are all that you'd expect from a modern CGI-heavy film. I saw it in 2-D as there wasn't any reason not to. Everything looked good, nothing looked overly fake. The giant scorpions were impressive.<br /><br />Beyond that, the various characters were all essentially background dressing. Hades was somewhat interesting (though I could really do without him being portrayed as evil all the time. Hades was not evil), but not all that great. Zeus' armor was way too bright and looked very out of place for a Greek era, but the character himself was... well, somewhat interesting. None of the other gods even have speaking roles, beyond a couple words from Apollo, so there's really nothing there. All the Greeks except Draco and some mad guru who for all the world looks like he should be worshiping Krishna (he even has the third eye thing going on!), are pretty interchangeable.<br /><br />Also at the end there's a very blatant setup for a sequel which could actually be interesting. I'd love to see Perseus going off and encountering other Greek heroes (perhaps an Argonauts film?), or even heroes from other mythologies. Imagine would could be done with a film showing him facing off against Gilgamesh and Enkidu!<br /><br />I have a great sense that this film was originally supposed to be about a half-hour longer. There's several parts where it seems like there's scenes missing (how does Perseus get back out of the underworld?), and certain people who were clearly supposed to have speaking roles, like Alexander Siddig as Hermes, aren't really on screen at all. It has studio meddling all over it. I look forward to a director's cut that might restore some of these scenes and make for a better, more interesting film. What we have now isn't bad, but it could be so much, much better.<br /><br />Oh, and for all you Skins fans out there, let me tell you now so you won't sit there wondering all movie like I did: yes, that's Nicholas Hoult as Eusebios.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>While I've never agreed with the idea that only bad movies should be remade, the 1981 version of "Clash of the Titans" is a perfect example of why such statements are valid. This new 2010 version is, quite simply, a better film. It features special effects that are convincing, and with all due respect to his fans, the same cannot be said about the Ray Harryhausen claymation of the original. It tells a story that's equally preposterous but far less campy. The characters, while lacking any real depth, are given lines that no longer border on embarrassing. And the action sequences are much more exciting, in large part because of the aforementioned special effects, which are now presented in 3-D. When compared to the original, there really is no comparison.<br /><br />As a standalone piece, however, it certainly isn't without its weaknesses. The story, while relatively easy to follow, is painfully short on detail, and it generally seems at a distance from the Greek mythology on which it's based. It's nothing more or less than a showcase of CGI, which means you're meant to look at it but not really think about what's going on. I don't mind this, as long as my senses aren't being assaulted; unlike recent big budget effects extravaganzas like "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" and "G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra," "Clash of the Titans" allows the audience to take in its visual delights, to savor the effort that went into them. One can watch it and actually be entertained.<br /><br />The story focuses on a demigod named Perseus (Sam Worthington), born as the result of an affair between a mortal queen and the god Zeus (Liam Neeson). When his beloved adoptive family is killed at the hands of Zeus' wicked brother, Hades (Ralph Fiennes), Perseus vows that he will have his revenge. He then ends up in the seaside city of Argos, where Queen Cassiopeia (Polly Walker) angers the gods by daring to claim that her daughter, Andromeda (Alexa Davalos), is more beautiful than the goddess Aphrodite. In response to this, Hades gives her two options: Either Argos will be destroyed by a monstrous sea creature known as the Kraken, or Andromeda will be sacrificed. Thus begins Perseus' heroic journey, one that will take him from the cave of the Stygian Witches to the ruined lair of Medusa.<br /><br />Keeping continuous watch over Perseus is Io (Gemma Arterton), priestess for the goddess Hera. Why she's compelled to protect him is never adequately explained, although I suppose it has something to do with Zeus, who can't seem to decide whether or not Perseus should be helped or harmed. Why harmed? Because he, like the entire city of Argos, has turned his back on the gods and no longer offers his prayers to keep them sustained. I personally find that very immature coming from omnipotent beings, but then again, we find much immaturity and vengefulness in Greek mythology. Consider Artemis: Because a commander named Agamemnon killed a sacred stag, she wouldn't let him or the Greek Fleet sail to Troy unless his daughter, Iphigenia, was sacrificed.<br /><br />I digress. The truth is that "Clash of the Titans," while hardly a great movie, succeeds at being exactly what it wants to be. One can easily admire the work that went into the visuals, the makeup, the costumes, and the action. One of the most exciting sequences involves a disfigured king named Acrisius (Jason Flemyng), whose body has been fortified by Hades himself; when his blood drips onto the sand, it results in the creation of gigantic scorpions, which then flail wildly as Perseus and his men attack with full force. I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed when it's eventually discovered that these beasts can be tamed and ridden like horses. Where's the fun in that?<br /><br />And then there's the final sequence with the Kraken, featured prominently in the ads. The ensuing battle is surprisingly short, which, considering the level of technical wizardry on display, is a bit anticlimactic. Still, what little we are shown is exhilarating, aided greatly by the 3-D technology.<br /><br />Sometimes, it's fun to see a movie that doesn't require the audience to think. It merely wants to entertain you, to take you on a two-hour journey away from life. That's exactly what "Clash of the Titans" did for me; it's an escapist film, a delightful distraction that consistently kept me involved. You don't often come across remakes that outshine their predecessors. Then again, when you consider how bad the original "Clash of the Titans" was, director Louis Leterrier and the screenwriters didn't have to try all that hard. It sort of makes you wonder, then, why no one thought to wait until now to make this into a movie. If we learned anything from the Ralph Bakshi version of "The Lord of the Rings," it's that we shouldn't force a movie into existence before the technology is available to do the story justice.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Being a huge fan of the original Clash of the Titans, even the quirky special effects (which were probably groundbreaking at the time), I had high hopes for this remade version.  Unfortunately, this version almost makes me want to retaliate upon the filmmakers like the gods smote the people of Argos in the original.<br /><br />The story is essentially a Cliff's Notes version of the original, with Perseus (Sam Worthington) saving the citizens of Argos after they angered the gods by destroying temples and statues.  He embarks on a heroic quest, heavy-handedly aided by the gods - because his dad just happens to be Zeus (Liam Neeson) - to save humanity from the wrath of Zeus, unleashed via proxy by Hades (Ralph Fiennes).  If he is unsuccessful, the city's only option is to sacrifice princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) - no fault of her own, just a result of her mother Cassiopeia's ignorance and arrogance - to the Kraken, a sea monster unleashed by Poseidon.  During his journey with some soldiers of Argos, Perseus gets gifts and hints from not only his father, but the beautiful Io (Gemma Arterto - HUGE upgrade to Bergus Meredith), another demigod stuck in the middle of the story.<br /><br />As with many movies recently, dialogue has taken a backseat to special effects and action sequences.  There's a watered down heroic thrust to the movie, and no real incentive for Perseus to save Argos, much less Andromeda; all he wants is revenge on the gods, and the people of Argos are an afterthought.  This is a major flaw considering Andromeda was the driving force of the original quest, and here she's merely window dressing.<br /><br />I think the special effects are the deciding factor for this film.  All are stupendous, but at points it's subtraction by addition.<br /><br />At times the original Pegasus flew straight out of Napoleon Dynamite's notebook, but the 2010 version is outstanding!  A major upgrade.  Each scene trumps the next, convincing the viewer of not only the scene's reality, but fluid movements suggest that a winged horse actually exists.  Great special effects.  The best, however, is clearly Medusa.  Snakes for hair, sinewy muscle, a lethal bow and arrow, a gaze that turns men to stone.  The combination was enough to leave children with nightmares in 1981, and every facet was improved upon.  Add in a sinister laugh and an upgraded crib replete with chasms, razor-sharp stalagmites, "liquid hot magma," and the result is one of the scariest supernatural villains ever to appear on film.  (It's just too bad that she's so easy to kill in both version of COTT)<br /><br />On the other hand, the Kraken feels much too extra terrestrial, maybe a bit too Cloverfield for my tastes.  A better option would have been the original Kraken's look with updated FX technology.  For me, the Kraken was a disappointment, but not nearly as bad as the witches.  Ahh...The Stygian Witches, wise sages, toil and trouble, cauldron and bubble, all that jazz.  Their appearance is not nearly as appealing as the original version.  Rather than looking like wise, tormented, evil witches, the new version, once again, looks like alien triplets.  Finally, the completely awesome scorpions.  Perhaps the coolest subplot of both films, the giant scorpions form a dangerous obstacle for Perseus and his fellowship.  The problem with the remake is the scorpions' lethality is minimized when they are turned into nothing more than Clydesdales after an epic battle.  And I'm not even going to discuss Jar Jar Djinn.  Horrible!<br /><br />Verdict: If you fondly remember the original, wait for the rental.  If you don't remember or didn't like the original, you'll probably love this.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>Perseus (Sam Worthington) picked up from the sea by a fisherman, has no idea where he came from or where he is going. He just has distaste for gods, especially one that dispatch his adopted family. Now he is out to even the playing field and put Hades (Ralph Fiennes) down, way down. He has many assistants as Io (Gemma Arterton) and many adventures in the process. Three witches keep an eye on him. Someone may lose his or her head and there is more than one bad person. Will Perseus take Hades (Ralph Fiennes) down a peg or is Perseus doomed. In any event, he must get Kraken.<br /><br />This presentation shows that CGI and 3D do not a film make. It helps to have dialog, pacing and a little better knowledge of antiquity.  As far as CGI is considered, some things can look scary and others like cartoons. This film falls somewhere in the middle but not as bad as it could have been. They only used what was needed to tell their story in today's action packed terms. I saw this movie in the theater for the 3D experience. I wanted to see if it was an improvement over the red and green or red and blue glasses.<br />So far, I will hold judgment. Some 3D can be eye popping and make you duck as it is coming at you. In the case of this movie, it was more like looking through a stereoscope or View Master. The third dimension was behind the front plate. Combining the CGI fast action with the 3D technology created a hairy mess and you had to wait until it was over to guess what happened. In any event, I now have a new set of glasses to add to my collection.<br /><br />I am slightly prejudice because I saw the original Clash and know what the movie could have been. However, it was not as bad as it could have been and has all the earmarks of a Hallmark special. The original film took a few liberties with the story but this version was out of the ballpark. See it once to help appreciate the original.</p></br><a href="../users/AOXL514GEE4AA.html">AOXL514GEE4AA</a><br/><p>Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you Sam Worthington! The next great action hero...who can act! I mentioned in my Terminator Salvation review that there was something special about this guy and this remake of Clash of the Titans should solidify that! This is saying a lot considering how short on character development this film is. Imagine if a lousy actor played Perseus? This would've been a complete bomb.<br /><br />Clash of the Titans is an adrenaline rush! Fans of the original should love this. It follows the myth of Perseus and the Gods of Olympus with some new twists along the way. The short of it is simple. Perseus (Worthington) is the son of Zeus (Neeson)and as the last remaining demi-god the city of Argos looks to him to save them. Feuled with rage against Hades (Fiennes) for killing his earthly adopted parents, Perseus takes up the quest to stop the revenge of the gods. The task, capture the head of Medusa, kill the Kraken and send Hades back to the underworld! Sounds like fun? It is! A complete romp and action fest.<br /><br />The movie does fail on one level, and it is an important one: character development. The storyline is wonderful and the great actors in this film do much with little. If only they would have spent 15 extra minutes on the band of soldiers and the royal family of Argos, we might have found a little more emotional investment. You just don't care when people start dying and that is never good.<br /><br />All in all, this movie still packs a wallop and is totally enjoyable! Even with it's flaws, this movie is pure entertainment and a wonderful remake of a classic!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Clash of the Titans was made for BLU! This movie gets 5 brilliant stars for video and audio! SPECIAL FEATURES: Wonderful and copius. Check out the deleted scenes and alternate ending only found on BD. You will appreciate the ending they chose even more. FINAL THOUGHTS: A DEMO DISC, OWN IT, SHOW YOUR FRIENDS!</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>Clash of the titans has an enjoyable story, that does not just sell to us the old clash of the titans with special effects. The special effects are sometimes great, and I cheered for the heroes of this well made epic movie. Sam worthington as Perseus is a character that is more a simple man, not made up to be a demi-god. He cherishes his human roots and believes that all gods are decietfull, and full of mischief. It is much different than the original perseus, who is played by a male model, with long tresses of dark hair, and always had an awe for the gods. Sam plays perseus with accusing hate, and revenge towards a particular god that was not in the original clash of the titans. The change here is unexpected, and for me, I enjoyed it greatly. It gives new meaning to clash of the titans when hades is involved who is a powerful god.<br /><br />I tossed out everything I had heard of going into this movie, and because of that, I think I can enjoy this movie for the fun that it is. I would even say that the script is well thought out and very dramatic at times. I particularly enjoyed how andromeda was played down in this. Perseus is not so impressed with looks, in the original persueus was a ladies man, this is a drastic change from the older version. And it was a reward for me that Perseus did not suddenly fall in some flimsy love with the stunning andromeda, but instead for the girl that truely loved him. Perseus is a hero, a demi-god, but he is not some diva, and he earns his keep throughout this movie. I thought this change made the casting of Sam Worthington perfect in my eyes. He can play the everyman with ease, and it is natural for him. I was afraid at first, that maybe he was miscasted, because of the vision of the male model Perseus I had from the original.<br /><br />The special effects are very handsome, when it comes to some of the effects that are made by Hades and his witches. I also loved the visuals of this movie in general. The makeup of the three sisters was creepy, and much different than the original. The look of madusa was very different than any picture of madusa that I have ever seen. She has a beautiful face, but with snakes for hair and has a different, enraged, face she takes when stunning men into stone. The original focused on sounds and reflections more, and it is a classic scene. They do not rely so much in this version, but they do prep the scene that gives it another layer of substance it wouldn't of had without the setup. Some of my favorite characters meet their doom here, and the battle with madusa is more of a mouse and bait scene with perseus, and does not have the potency and sense of danger that the original had, but it was still a great scene in itself.<br /><br />The movie is layered nicely, with a story that you will not fight, but watch willingly. Instead of having a problem with the changes, I rather did not have trouble with the treatment from the classic movie. I have compared some scenes such as the medusa scene, because it tries to retain some of the classic feel, but does not do as well. But the main strength of this movie for me were the many exciting changes to the story, and the unwilling father, son relationship that later on develops into something meaningful.<br /><br />There are many words of wisdom that you listen to, as many different people and gods teach the young Perseus, and it makes for an enjoyable, social setting that the original also had. Help comes unexpected, and in mysterious ways, as is the way of the ancient gods and the new version is successful in recreating it for a new generation. You will meet new characters, which will become a heroic party, that reminded me more of Krull, more than the original clash of the titans. There goal is worthy, and there are many heroe's, and not all of them carry swords. Andromeda is a hero for the sacrifice she was willing to make. And in a way, the soldiers who decimate the homages to the gods are heroe's also, because the dared challenge a god and stood for what they believed in.<br /><br />This is a great movie, with lots of adventure, and epic battles. I had a great amount of fun during the entirety of the film and think it has repeat value as well. The special effects are well done in most cases and the changes to the origianal are mostly good. I recommend this great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Like many of my peers who grew up in the eighties, Clash of the Titans holds a special place in my heart.  Harryhausen's vision burned certain iconic moments in my memory:  My Clash of the Titan's lunchbox.  My winged Pegasus toy with Harry Hamlin-looking Perseus (complete with vacuous gaze and stiff arms).  Shouting "Perseus!" and throwing any stick-like object (hockey sticks, bats, edged weapons) to my friends. All these elements have ensured a certain reverence for Clash of the Titans, not to mention hopelessly muddling my knowledge of Greek history until well into my high school years.<br /><br />This new version of Clash of the Titans is not that movie (spoilers ahead!):<br /><br />Oh, it's a reimagining of course.  There are attempts to provide the shadow of a coherent plot to the whole thing.  The original was actually a love story; the jealous goddess Thetis became Perseus' nemesis over his love for poor Andromeda, with Zeus surreptitiously helping his errant son.  In the remake Zeus is openly hostile to humanity, who is apparently attempting to overthrow the gods by...blowing up their statues, I guess. Hades manipulates Zeus into terrorizing humanity instead of asking for their prayers.  Two drachmas to the person who guesses the trick Hades has up his sleeve.<br /><br />The movie hits all the high points: Calibos (Acrisius in the new version), Pegasus, Medusa, the scorpions, the Kraken.  And for the first half at least, the plot shambles along pleasantly and the audience can marvel at the breathtaking score and dizzying 3D.<br /><br />Then the Djinn show up.  I have a phrase I called "jump the monkey" which is a bit like "jump the shark." The last installment of Indiana Jones had me interested until vine-swinging monkeys jumped to the rescue of our hero.  The moment turned pulp heroic fun into retrograde cartoon pandering to audiences of all ages.  The Djinn are Clash of the Titans' "monkey jump."<br /><br />Because this new incarnation of the movie has to be Bigger and Better than anything we've seen before, the scorpions that arise from Acrisius' blood (not Medusa's like in the original) are gargantuan. So big, in fact, that it stretches our willing suspension of disbelief that our heroes will even be able to defeat them.  And then they do.  Whew! A jump cut later and...<br /><br />BIGGER scorpions show up.  These are colossal.  Our heroes can't possibly defeat them.  Fortunately, we have a deus ex machine in the form of Djinn.  They are "sand demons," some kind of Greek-style cyborgs who replace their broken bodies with magic.  They have cool blue glowing eyes and know how to control giant scorpions.  Actually, they RIDE them.<br /><br />Scorpions.  Giant scorpions.  That didn't exist until Acrisius bled.  The Djinn carry around entire howdahs just to ride these giant scorpions in the span of just one day.  I made up a reason for why this is. Surely the scorpions were created from the sand, not Acrisius' blood, and that's why the Djinn are so familiar with them.  Yeah, okay, I'll roll with it...<br /><br />But wait...why are the Djinn still hanging around?  Why is one of the Djinn joining Perseus' party?  Why, when Perseus is trying to rouse his troops as they descend into Medusa's lair, is the Greek equivalent of a Wookie going along with them? Why has this movie jumped the monkey?<br /><br />I was so dazzled by the special effects that it didn't even dawn on me until my wife pointed it out. Medusa's gaze doesn't work on the Djinn, but it works on a Kraken? Did anyone else notice this Kraken-sized flaw in the plot?  Or did the directors just figure the 3D would make up for it?<br /><br />It didn't.  As much as I tried to love this new version of Clash of the Titans, I can't.  I can merely appreciate it for the big, dumb, Kraken of a movie it is.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I thought this was a very decent remake and great tribute to the 1981 classic.

When Hades threatens the city of Argos by releasing the Kraken, Perseus and his team decides to seek the Stygian Witches in hopes of figuring out a way to kill the Kraken. Along the way, they must deal with giant scorpions, befriend a race of Djinn, and try kill Medusa.

It's funny that Leterrier's film was supposed to have its visual effects stand as its greatest strength when as it turns out some of his action scenes, and more specifically the interactions between CGI monsters and normal characters, are about as seamless as Harryhausen's outdated efforts, which were themselves outgunned by George Lucas and others thirty years ago.  Harryhausen's work was probably deemed most eye-popping almost sixty years ago (i.e.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00001W9GA">The 7th Voyage of Sinbad</a>).  Yes, there are some state of the art effects happening but they are handled by subpar imaginations and creativity that is definitely more miss than hit, and I mean that commentary to apply further to the costumes, sets, and make-up threefold.  The make-up is bad, the concepts are trite and at times over-stylized, and the hair!  Oh my goodness, the hair.  It seems that every alpha warrior of Argos has three hours to strategically place mud on themselves, apply eye-liner, and create extravagant cornrows and dreadlock-like mullet extensions.  And if you think I'm only going to be critical of this movie's visual flaws, keep reading.<br /><br />First, let's summarize.  The film follows a family of fisherman with the usual British accents who stumble upon a demi-god baby named Perseus (Sam Worthington).  As the story unfolds and the gods get really mad at people for thinking they are cooler than the gods, Perseus gets mad enough to allow his rage and taste for vengeance drive him toward going after the oh-so evil god of Hades and his vile sea creature titan, the Kraken.  But in order to do that he needs Medusa's head, and in order to get that he needs to talk to these batty old blind witches, and in order to do that he needs to fight a whole bunch of gigantic scorpions.  Along the way he also better start liking and praying to his god daddy so he can use a flying horse and his fancy but kind of ancient-looking lightsaber.  He's got to save Andromeda (played meaninglessly by Alexa Davalos) and maybe even at the end of the story Zeus will be kind of enough to grant him a lovely sex slave in Io (played yummy-ly by Gemma Arterton).<br /><br />Worthington's acting can be described as kind of like Russell Crowe in that really intense scene in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NU2CY4">Gladiator</a> when Maximus reveals himself to Commodus in the arena, only Worthington talks like that all the time and it never ever changes, not even for a second.  Liam Neeson (Zeus) hams it up and Ralph Fiennes (Hades) makes Neeson's performance look comparably very serious.  Polly Walker (Casseopiea) recycles her role as Atia in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028RXXE8">HBO's Rome</a> but strictly in the most superficial sense, because she was wasted and her role, like many here, was merely part of the set.  Danny Huston (Poseidon) was completely wasted.  The rest of the cast came off as a bunch of awkward live action role-players gathered together right from their LARPing event as starstruck extras, but they were instead given speaking parts.  Even worse than that was a character who I can't seem to find a name for anywhere.  He was a priest of sorts who looked to worship Hades and sacrifice Andromeda.  He delivers truly some of the worst acting I've seen in a very very long time.<br /><br />The acting is an easy target and so is the writing.  Many will forgive these things but I will not, so keep that in mind.  The writing in scenes with less action is unbearable and the screenplay is lazy, even for a remake of a film with a lazy screenplay to begin with.  Still, I'm really being hard on this film when it did have some brights spots that are incredibly memorable and show-off the amazing CGI without being too gratuitous.  To say the film doesn't go way overboard at times with its effects is an understatement.  Instead of coming out of a cage deep in the ocean the Kraken is released after the entire ocean floor breaks open.  His exit from the water is indeed remarkable but you know that already if you've seen the commercials; it's just a longer version of that.  The Pegasus is beautiful too and the horse they had was great.  The real work with the horse combined with the very believable CGI in his scenes were seamless and very enjoyable.  However, the best scene in the movie has been kept pretty well from the public and that is of course Medusa.  Instead of the ugly stop-motion snake lady slithering quietly in the memorable gothic horror-like scene from the original 1981 movie, we get a beautiful face within a mane of snakes and a fast-moving gorgon that petrifies her enemies in by far the most keenly edited footage the film has to offer.  That scene by itself might be worth the price of admission to many but it still doesn't quite capture the charm of the original stop-motion Medusa.<br /><br />This isn't an inspired movie but for the most part it doesn't deviate from the spirit of the original, for better or worse.  It even makes one very well placed inside joke to lovers of the original film, but that scene's charm is quickly snuffed out by alarming and unintentional irony.  If I was twelve that would've gone over my head and this movie gets 4 out of 5 stars, but I'm not twelve. One more thing, the 3-D adds virtually nothing to this film as an experience seeing in a theater, unless you count wearing dark glasses for two hours.  Wait for DVD or blu-ray.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>If you have fond memories of Ray Harryhausen's 1981 version, you owe it to yourself to see what 30 years of technological advances have done for adventure movies involving fantastic monsters. They're fantastic!<br /><br />No doubt you know the story by now, although this version has some interesting twists. Perseus (Sam Worthington) is a demi-god: Zeus (Liam Neeson) was his father by a human mother. A queen, in fact. Zeus disguised himself as her husband and . . . Well, anyway, Perseus was raised by a fisherman and his family who were killed when some uppity soldiers tore down a statue of Zeus.<br /><br />Hades (Ralph Fiennes, who also played Lord Voldemort) gets angry at how uppity the humans are getting, and tells his brother Zeus he will teach them humility. He points out that while Zeus feeds on the humans' prayers and love, Hades lives on their fear.<br /><br />Anyway, Hades threatens to unleash the Kraken, a huge horrible monster, who can only be placated by the sacrifice of Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos), while Perseus has concluded that it is his destiny to slay the Kraken. But first he needs to defeat Medusa (Natalia Vodianova).<br /><br />He's not entirely alone, but the soldiers he took with him all seem to be pretty expendable. He has a guardian goddess, Io (Gemma Arterton), and a magical sword from Zeus that he refuses to use until the last minute, and the invaluable aid of Pegasus. Oddly, in this version Pegasus is the only black winged horse in the herd; I'm used to his being white.<br /><br />It's rousing thrill-a-minute adventure, not too gory for the older kids, and refreshingly realistic compared to the stop-action techniques of Harryhausen. There are several extra characters, one whole group of which I won't tell you about because their appearance on the scene is a surprise, as is their role in the story. If you love mythology, you'll love this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AK7ZFKW08HID.html">A2AK7ZFKW08HID</a><br/><p>I loved 300, so it was no surprise that I loved Clash of the Titans. It looks great on bluray and the action was cool. The CGI was really well done, can't comment on the 3d version cause I have read that out really sucked so I didn't even bother with it. Great all around fighting flick, check it out and sit back and enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/ALWB64XOXNMDP.html">ALWB64XOXNMDP</a><br/><p>This movie is just as good if not better than the original. It doesn't waste it's time with long stretches of dialogue.  It cuts right to the action.  It doesn't linger on, at only 90 minutes.  I liked the medusa scenes and especially the creature battle at the conclusion. If you liked the original, you'll certainly like this version too.  I noticed the actor Pete Postlethwaite looks like he's plays Perseus's father. He puts in a good performance that grounds the movie.<br /><br />The extras present a few good cut scenes that were good but would have otherwise dragged down the film.  If you can buy it for under $10, it's well worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IY9M330NKBW6.html">A2IY9M330NKBW6</a><br/><p>None of the paid critics liked this movie very much, but the trailers were cool and I like Sam Worthington so I figured it wouldn't hurt to view it. It didn't, but it wasn't a pleasant experience either.<br /><br />On the plus side the action scenes with the big monsters were put together very well. The rest was pretty cruddy. First was the casting. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes have worn out their welcomes with me. If I never see them in another movie it will be too soon. Liam phoned it in and Ralph was so awful he must have been really upset that he was even in the movie. The rest of the cast was OK but nothing stellar which might be due to the fact that few of them had all that much to do. In all fairness, when the band of adventurers was formed for the quest (the two brothers were a hoot) there was a sense of male bonding happening, and most of the actors did a decent job, but even this has been done much better before. Sam Worthington did a fine job and somehow his lines were better than everyone else'. As bad as this script and the dialogue was his lines were generally good. It were as though the producers had a personal writer for him.<br /><br />The directing was mostly horrendous. The camera always seemed to be in the wrong place. These types of movies have gotten so much better over the years. You'd think the director, Louis Leterrier, would have watched a few of them to get some kind of clue on how to do this. That's another curiosity. How could he direct some of the action scenes so well and most of the others so poorly. Go figure.<br /><br />The costuming was pretty horrid as well. Much of the hair styling stunk and the music was OK but forgettable.<br /><br />The story was there. It's just a shame it was so mishandled. I like these kinds of movies and went into this wanting to savor all the good parts. Problem was....there were too few of them to savor.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>The much-antivipated remake of "Clash Of The Titans" roared into theaters in 2-D and 3-D, and it more than lived up to my expectations. The story from the first movie has been expanded thoroughly, and given a few twists that would make Zeus proud. Sam Worthington ("Terminator: Salvation") was perfectly cast as Perseus, as was Gemma Atterton as Io, Liam Neeson as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes as Hades (interestingly, this movie marks the first time Neeson and Fiennes have been on screen together since Steven Spielberg's epic drama "Schindler's List"). Everyone was st to a perfect T in this film. The music is nothing less than epic. The 3-D effects are AWESOME. I've only a few minor quibbles: for one thing, I noticed that several scenes in the trailer (including one where Andromeda says to Perseus, "This isn't your fight" and he replies, "Someone has to take a stand") were cut from the movie. Secondly, I was disappointed that Medusa didn't speak in this versio (though the additonal screaming was perfect). Thirdly, I would have liked a flashback, showing Medusa before Athena transformed her into the creature we see in the temple (she was still beautiful until she screamed; I had no problem with her still being beautiful, though). Fourthly, and lastly, the film could have been about 30-60 minutes longer, with some more character development.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>The original 'clash of the titans' is a fanstastic movie story wise. Some dumb people today might criticize the old style effects which were fading away quickly but were a artform in themselves: stop motion animation that is, in fact by the time I met a effects guy from hollywood,  who was dying of lung cancer in 1995, and who had worked on lots of these movies going back to the 50's, it was gone even from the lowest budget movies. This one has the modern cgi effects that were undreamed of in the originals 1980 movie, but it has no soul, it's like a mindless movie without any characterization or depth. The first one has characters that matter though. THis is still enjoyable in that we watch these greek heroes battle fierce mythological creatures with fantastic modern effects. Which are not as true a artform s the stop motion stuff but still looks more realistic. It's just that they didn't understand what made the first one a hit was the acting and characters. You had alot of great actors in the first one and a fun telling , here it's little talking and lots of action , this is a b movie with a higher budget and that's ok though. Still I remember the classic and can't give it more than three stars.  the blu ray looks awesome though!  Blu ray is usually the only way to go and that's true here for certain.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>When it comes to Ray Harryhausen there is no bigger fan of his work and films. When I heard about this remake I was excited, but after reading many reviews I decided to wait until it came on cable before seeing it. I happened to come across this Blu Ray very cheap and I took a chance. To my surprise, this remake isn't as bad as many have claimed, but does nothing to improve on the original either.<br /><br />The special effects are a highlight in both versions, but in this film they are used sparingly. You never get a good look at the monsters, only quick cuts and fast motion I assume to hide the cracks in the CGI work? I know the younger generation see Ray Harryhausen's(RH)work as old fashioned or even quaint, but he is one of the pioneers of the craft and has and will continue to inspire generations of film makers long after this remake disappears into obscurity. It was fitting of the makers of this fim to put in a cameo of BoBo the owl as a nod to RH.<br /><br />The story has been changed, but not for the better, only adding confusion and depriving us of a real hero. In RH's original film the story was more straightforward and even though a little corny at times, it did a better job of keeping the motives of the characters more believable.<br /><br />Back to the special effects as this is really the reason to watch any Harryhausen film remake or not. I'm glad that they kept RH's design for Medusa as is it one of the coolest interpretations of her, even though not accurate by Mythological standards. As far as RH's stop motion work, I really don't think people are aware of the amount of work that RH put into the Medusa sequence in the original. Medusa's snake filled hair, her tail and all body movements are painstakingly done with the upmost finesse and skill. Even more amazing is that the flame lit lair is also something he had to take into consideration. Switching the light reflection frame by frame to make it look like flames flickering. Add in the fact the man was in the twilight of his career at almost 70 years old! It was nothing short of breathing taking in its time and I doubt it could ever be duplicated. If we factor in the money and time allowed to create this and all the other creature effects, it is unbelievable that it was completed. I would have loved to see what he could have done with a budget of the remake!<br /><br />The Medusa in this film looks very good, but I think there is more tension in the original scene with her slowly stalking her intruders. In fact, most of the creatures in this remake serve only as a reminder of how great Harryhausen was at his craft, giving his creatures life and personality. The original film suffers from budget restraints that actually effect the look of the film, as all the prints I've seen of it are dark, grainy and the matte shots stick out like a sore thumb, so naturally this remake looks incredible by comparison.<br /><br />The original has more creatures and the story is told in a more entertaining way, but the remake has some impressive special effects and a story that is not as corny. If only we could combine the two to make one great film. Clash of the Titans is a solid action adventure film with some nifty effects, but I will watch RH's version far more times than this one.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Nearly 30 years after the original "Clash of the Titans" graced the silver screen, Hollywood has chosen to resurrect the gods of Greek mythology under the direction of action director Louis Letterier ("The Incredible Hulk").<br /><br />"Clash of the Titans" follows a man named Perseus (Sam Worthington), who unbeknownst to him is the son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), as he travels in search of taking vengeance upon the dark god Hades (Ralph Fiennes). To complete his quest, Perseus will join forces with a group of warriors to face off against some of the fiercest creatures imaginable and prove that even a god can bleed.<br /><br />With technology at a point where these legendary figures and monsters can look more realistic, awe-inspiring and/or terrifying than ever before, now seems like a fitting time to revisit this classic tale. Yet, with all of the visual spectacle on display and a director known for fast-paced, adrenaline pumping features, does this newest iteration live up to its obviously dated predecessor?<br /><br />The answer...surprisingly, is no! For all of its visual panache those responsible for this film were far too preoccupied with wowing audiences with as much spectacle in under two hours as possible that the story got lost right from the start.<br /><br />What little story there is, which by the way merely exists for the sole purpose of carrying the various characters and the audience from one fight to another, is written by the writing duo of Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi (the writers responsible for the utterly lackluster "Aeon Flux"). This paper-thin imitation of a screenplay is an insult to not only fans of the original film hoping for a modern day update with terrific storytelling and awesome visuals, but to the enduring myths that spawned these legendary characters in the first place.<br /><br />How exactly is this film's story insulting? Well, let's start with the biggest part of the film, which is the human story. This aspect of the story is rushed along at an incredibly fast pace, which somewhat works to the film's advantage in that the audience doesn't really have time to see its faults. Yet, at the same time it's detrimental in that one never really gets a sense as to why we should even remotely care for the people on screen. There is next to nothing in terms of character development, both on Earth and on Olympus, and the various character motivations are so weak that I never once believed any of them would actually go to such great lengths to succeed in their mission.<br /><br />When a movie deals with such otherworldly themes, it is vital that the human element be presented as strongly as possible to ground the movie in some semblance of a reality. Not to mention allow for the audience to connect with the various characters so we can actually become enthralled by their journey. This aspect is never given time to develop and as a result there is zero emotional investment, leaving the audience numb to the experience.<br /><br />Another major issue facing this film's plot is that the gods themselves are ancillary characters that receive only marginal screen time. The original (if memory serves) featured numerous sequences focusing solely on the gods of Olympus overseeing us mere mortals on Earth. Due to the merely passing glimpses we receive of the gods, we're left with the main crux driving the godly portion of the story being relegated to the opening 90 seconds of the film.<br /><br />This approach to exposition is fine when handling a remake of a film only a few years old where audiences don't need a lot of rehash (i.e. Louis Letterier's remake/reboot of 2003's "Hulk" with 2008's "The Incredible Hulk"); however, this is not the method to use for the redo of a nearly 30-year old property where a good old fashioned refresher course is warranted.<br /><br />Fans of these classic tales want more depth, and the Greek myths demand more substance to coincide with all of the flash that modern day visual effects houses can provide. The stories surrounding these legendary figures should not be mentioned only in passing, I mean the story elements at your disposal could have sustained a two to three hour Hollywood epic (which is what this film should have been all along).<br /><br />Not to mention we receive nary a glimpse at any of the gods' powers in use, an aspect I thought would possibly run the risk of being over-used instead of little to none. Aside from the releasing of the infamous Kraken (as was so heavily touted in the myriad of trailers for this film) only Medusa and Hades are given time to display some of their abilities.<br /><br />Come on Louis, you skimmed over the mythological history of these characters, the least you could have delivered to us is a smorgasbord of their powers and abilities on display throughout. Seriously, how great would it have been to see Zeus unleashed or Poseidon or (insert your choice here). What were you thinking not going crazy with some massive display of power from the inhabitants of Olympus? Something like that seems like it would be a visual effects wizard's dream come true. But I digress.<br /><br />While on the topic of the film's visuals, the various effects houses in charge of bringing these elements to life produced a surprisingly mixed bag of results. For the most part, the visuals are quite impressive, some even borderline stunning, while others look too obvious or even cartoonish in nature. Personally, despite some weak spots, I enjoyed the updated visuals that are featured in this incarnation over those of Ray Harryhausen from the original, simply because most look so much more life-like and realistic than anything that stop-motion animation could ever even dream of achieving.<br /><br />One particular segment that I found to be well done was the giant scorpion fights (another sequence that was heavily shown in the previews). This long fight scene was visually impressive and generally entertaining; although, maybe we could have shortened that sequence by a couple of minutes to make room for showcasing some of the other gods' powers.<br /><br />It really is a shame that instead of capitalizing on the technology at their fingertips to create awesome visuals worthy of the Greek myths, we're left with gods who simply stood around and talked all day long. Not to mention, an overly long giant scorpion fight that became far too repetitive before it finally came to a close.<br /><br />Now, I must turn my disappointment towards the cast of this forgettable remake. Headlining the cast, despite his limited acting range and number of roles under his belt, is the ever stoic Sam Worthington. As Perseus, Sam is basically asked to combine the strongest, athletic, and action-oriented parts of his previous notable roles from "Terminator: Salvation" and "Avatar" and channel them into this character. Even with his limited talent pool in terms of dramatic acting, I will say that Sam at least put forth an effort in his previous performances; however, in this film his acting is on action movie autopilot.<br /><br />This time around the only facial expressions Sam displays are anger, a few moments of laughter, and poorly conveyed sadness; of course, I can't forget, the look that comprised the majority of his screen time, namely his go-to expression...the stern, blank stare. As for the other facets of his performance, his line readings were as bland and wooden as ever, although in his defense, it didn't appear that the script really called for much more effort. Beyond those two sub-par aspects of his performance, not surprisingly Sam delivered on the action-oriented side of the role. While he won't be nominated for any Academy Awards for his "dramatic" work on this film, Sam should be a guaranteed nominee for the MTV Movie Awards' "Best Action Star" award.<br /><br />In the primary supporting roles are three extremely talented actors, Liam Neeson ("Taken"), Ralph Fiennes ("Harry Potter" films), and the man who portrayed one of the best James Bond villains in quite some time, Mads Mikkelson ("007: Casino Royale"). Personally, I'm extremely disappointed in Liam and Ralph for even taking part in this film. Because at this point in their careers they have enough clout in Hollywood (not to mention money) that they could have either demanded a better script (one with dare I say...character development) or just walked away in order to save face. As for Mads, well he probably doesn't have the clout or as much money, so his participation could be better understood.<br /><br />Still, all of the above actors possess acting talent far superior to what they put on display in this film. Truth be told though, it was their involvement in this movie that gave the proceedings some credibility, albeit ever so slightly.<br /><br />One last bit of gripes about the cast. The two prominent female roles in this film were either completely thankless (Gemma Arterton's role of Io) or nothing more than a plot device (Alexa Davalos as Andromeda). Both actresses have shown considerable acting chops in previous work, yet as with everyone else in this film, there's nothing worthy of note in their performances here.<br /><br />The only thing I can figure for why these actors and actresses signed on to this movie was the chance to be a part of a burgeoning Hollywood franchise. Now, that statement does not apply to Sam Worthington. I believe that for him any chance to play a role that calls for little to no emotion is an opportunity that he's going to jump at with gusto. But, for the others, that's the only excuse I can come up with. At least the temptation of a franchise is something I can understand; if it turns out to be anything else, then they should all be ashamed.<br /><br />Sadly, despite all of this film's potential to become an incredible epic blockbuster, all that those involved in the project managed to cultivate was just another silly summer popcorn movie. Granted, I have enjoyed many a silly summer popcorn movie, but this one wasn't even all that entertaining.<br /><br />Despite my obvious disdain for this remake, the movie managed to make plenty of money. So, the powers-that-be are moving full-steam ahead on a second installment. Hopefully, they'll correct some of the glaring mistakes from this opening chapter, and make a movie truly worthy of the mythological characters inhabiting this series' universe.<br /><br />"Clash of the Titans" is rated PG-13 for violence and brief language.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K.html">A2BSZPRBKYAB2K</a><br/><p>If I could give this 3 1/2 stars I would. But there is no 1/2 stars for rating so I gave it a three.  I feel that is a fair judgement.  I really enjoyed the special effects of when the scorpions attack, when Perseus and the other soldiers go into Medussa's temple, and the ride across the river Styx and Charon the ferryman, well I like this version of him.  Now for the story...Great potential that falls short.  The lead actors and actresses do a great job with the script that was given.  From Liam Neeson(Zeus) to Sam Worthington (Perseus) whois helpless to save his family from Hades (Ralph Fiennes), god of the underworld to Gemma Arterton (IO) the woman who watches, not a complaint on the acting.  The script however runs the basic same old story.  I don't like the special effects of the Krakon.  The movie thought that the more the monster the better.  Not in this case.  This isn't a bad movie to watch on a cloudy and rainy day.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>This movie is totally different from the original Harry Hamlin movie so it's important to just separate from nostalgia and loyalty to give this film a fair shake.  But the mistakes in camera closeups and the mumbling of Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are irritating.  Also, wearing a beard while mumbling as both these actors do give the effect of chewing on dryer lint.  I need closed captioning to follow this film so I can't imagine this was a pleasant movie theater experience.  I found this movie unwatchable but I get the message that the Greeks used mythology as an evolutionary tool to inspire literacy, imagination and moral foundation.  Once society had reached an aspirational plateau, these myths/gods were no longer necessary for daily life and just became Beautiful Stories for Children (not just the Ugly ones as authored by Dan Sweetman.)</p></br><a href="../users/A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3.html">A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3</a><br/><p>What more can I say?

The reason being because I recently saw Jason and the Argonauts, a film that clearly surpasses Clash '81 in almost every conceivable category be it storytelling, special effects, overall production, and even BD presentation. 18 years after the fact and Clash '81 barely feels like an upgrade over Jason in terms of.. well, anything. The stop animation is barely on par, while the pacing and narrative are even a tad weaker, and yet it's still treasured just for the sake of nostalgia. When I heard a new version of Clash was being directed by Louis Letterier, I was pretty excited. Being familiar with his previous works I knew he came from an action background as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; under Luc Besson and that he'd easily find ways to improve the shortcomings of the original to make a more fulfilling fantasy epic. Aside from character and location names, that's about all both movies have in common. And in creating his version from scratch, I feel Letterier has managed to make a very good and entertaining action flick that's not so much a remake, but rather an adaptation for today's audiences. It's a darker, grittier, and more violent film with all sorts of new characters, themes, and special effects that make for better and faster-paced storytelling. Instead of the playful nature of the original where the gods were just bickering over superiority and toying around with their chessboard, or the way Perseus just slowly made his way from point to point with little to no difficulty, I actually felt a deeper sense of drive and purpose from this new version. For starters, the gods actually show emotion: desperation for the love/fear of the people and the power it gives them, jealousy, spite, and vengeance through deception (between Zeus and Hades), and even a little bit of humility (in what Zeus learns about man from Perseus). Meanwhile, the new Perseus actually has some character depth as well: his demi-god blood puts him at odds with the people he's trying to help, while his pride in being raised as a man makes him stubborn in accepting his god-given gifts and heritage, yet he still chooses to fight the oppressive rule of the gods and show them the virtues of being a man. These themes obviously don't get as much exposure as they should, what with a mere 95 minutes of screen time. But having set this foundation of ideals, hopefully the sequels will expand upon them. Much like Letterier's The Incredible Hulk, watch it for the action, but expect hints of story and character.<br /><br />Video - 4.5<br /><br />While the photography of Clash '10 does, indeed, have a kind of a processed look, it's actually not that bad. I would personally attribute it to something along the lines of visual effects and/or tweaks made during post-production that, at times, gives certain scenes either a kind of shiny or hazy look (like Mount Olympus and the gods' Saint Seiya armor or the ferry trip across the River Styx). But despite the near-grainless appearance, picture quality looks excellent. Colors from the costuming, set design, beautifully-shot backgrounds, and various creatures still possess a degree of vibrancy from the palace props and soldiers' gear, to the lush greens of the forest and fiery reds of Medusa's lair, to the murky brown scales and tentacles of the Kraken. Black levels are nice and inky, though not too deep, but with great shadow delineation, as seen in the black Pegasus or Stygian Mountain when the witches are introduced. Contrast provides for accurate brightness when need be, though the film itself tries to be a little too dark at times and, thus, loses some detail in people and objects leading to bits and pieces of softness. On the bright side, there don't appear to be any signs of Edge Enhancement or DNR, and the picture is completely free of artifacts and debris. CG integration is especially smooth, with highlights being the various appearances of Hades and, of course, the aforementioned Kraken. It should also be noted that 90% of the backgrounds are not even green screen, which amazes me that places like that even exist, so be sure to take those images in as you see them.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Besides the cinematography and special effects, one of my favorite improvements with this new Clash is its sound. Granted the original, like many a Harryhausen feature, was a bit on the low-budget side of production, but it's nice to see and hear the differences in advancement. Dialogue is clear and undistorted through the center and does a great job staying audible amongst the action, while the growls of Zeus and the haunting whispers of Hades give the script a much-appreciated Thespian quality. Directionality has an excellent sense of depth with sounds and action filling their respective speakers when needed, most notably in the battle against Medusa as she rattles and slithers about her temple. Separation is also spot-on with effects and music dispersing equally through the fronts and rears to accompany the situation. While it's a shame Craig Armstrong was dropped as composer (love his work for The Incredible Hulk), Ramin Djawadi's stuff isn't so bad. I actually like his score for Iron Man, and it was nice to hear him try something with more orchestral instrumentation. If you like brass, expect to hear a lot of it. And finally, LFEs aren't as frequent as I expected, but they really pack a punch when they occur. The thundering of Zeus's bolts in the sky, the Scorpinochs battle, and the rising of the Kraken will give your subwoofer a thoroughly progressive workout as each scene unfolds and builds upon the narrative. The overall track may or may not be reference to some, probably depending on your standards for LFEs, but given that there really aren't a whole lot of instances for LFEs to shine in the first place, this might be enough for others.<br /><br />Extras - 4.0<br /><br />This is my second time ever for a Maximum Movie Mode (the first being Sherlock Holmes). And while it's a tad disappointing Letterier couldn't do the entire thing in person, I actually still liked the commentary, regardless. Instead of the 2-screen, 1-director approach, we get a 2-3-screen presentation where the movie plays bigger and the commentary/interviews play in a smaller screen and takes turns switching priority. In-between these segments, icons for Focus Features will pop up and allow the user to watch a branched-off making-of sequence that lasts about 2-4 minutes per Feature for about 35 minutes total. These Focus Features do not constitute the entire MMM, by the way, and can be viewed separately from the MMM itself if you want. In addition to the Focus Features, the MMM actually takes up a good majority of the film providing lots of cool factoids and opinions from the cast and crew about the filming, design, production, writing, stunt work, and just about everything else. Objectively, all the information probably would've made a fine behind-the-scenes featurette on its own. But to watch it in real-time during the movie is what I think really raises my appreciation the most. The MMM literally explains and expands on every little bit of the movie piece by piece, and I applaud everyone involved for their hard work and perseverance. To top it all off, there's also an 8-minute feature on Sam Worthington that talks about the fact that he did most of his own stunts (a little generic, but I applaud his toughness), deleted scenes that would've completely changed the context of the story, and an alternate ending that wasn't as good as I'd hoped. It's not a lot of extras in terms of quantity, but the quality of it for the MMM alone is worth a look.<br /><br />Overall - 4.5<br /><br />Nostalgia will probably be the deal-breaker for most people wanting to see this movie. If you prefer the original version for its light-heartedness and more campy demeanor, chances are you won't like this new version because of its inclination toward a darker, grittier atmosphere. If you're like me and one of the few fans of Letterier that can appreciate his forte for action while also realizing this is just the beginning of a trilogy, then maybe you'll like this version enough and forgive a lot of its newer elements in writing and character portrayal. With excellent video, reference audio, and a commentary feature that continues to amaze me, Clash of the Titans (2010) comes highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>The first disappointment with this movie is the fake 3D effects. They looked like scenes cut out of cardboard then put one behind another to create virtual depth. It's terrible. It was actually shot in 2D then "magically" transferred to 3D to cash in on the 3D fever.<br /><br />The second disappointment was the characters were shallow.  The ones in the original 1980 script moved me with their depth and human feelings. Of course the special effects of the '80 movie were laughable.<br /><br />The fighting special effects of this film were a mixed bag. In one hand, it's very impressive. For example, the giant scorpions looked scary, and  real. On the other it's disturbingly disappointing because the fighting were filmed so quickly and jerkily I could hardly saw what were happening.<br /><br />In short, it's a waste of my money.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>PROS:<br />*Bubo's glorious cameo (the original's mechanical owl)<br />*Marvelous FX pay homage to Harryhausen maintaining their own freshness<br />The goddess-like beauty of Gemma Arterton and Alexa Davalos<br />*Ralph Fiennes and Jason Flemyng's scenery chewing villainy<br />*THE KRAKEN!!<br />*Marvelous musical score<br />CONS:<br />*Sam Worthington's listless performance<br />*Liam Neeson's disappointing Zeus<br />*Medusa scene too short<br />*A black Pegasus!!??<br />SUMMARY:  I enjoyed this movie--it's fun!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>With a summer movie season that has been disappointing, I think you're better off staying home and watching Clash of the Titans. Clash of the Titans is a rare remake that's actually good. The film looks great and it's also exciting. I don't know why most critics didn't like the movie because it's actually much better than I expected. A critic at Newsday even said we didn't need Clash of the Titans since Percy Jackson already taught about Greek gods, but this movie is way better than that was.<br /><br />  Sam Worthington is one of the better action stars around these days and he's good in this movie. My only complaint is that he looks like he just got a buzz cut for the role. He looks pretty awkward next to everyone else that has long hair in movie, they could have at least thrown a wig on him or something lol. I guess since the gods give Perseus (Sam Worthington) weapons for his journey, that they also shave his head when he's sleeping. Hey, they are gods so maybe they even had electric razors in the early days of mankind.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>The campy 1981 favorite Clash of the Titans gets a massive CGI-fed facelift with this remake directed by Louis Leterrier (The Incredible Hulk, Transporter 2), and it definitely isn't for the better.  Sam Worthington, hot on the heels of the success of Avatar, stars as the demigod Perseus, whose father Zeus (Liam Neeson) has grown disillusioned and unhappy with how the humans worship the Gods of Olympus.  When Zeus' evil brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) plans on unleashing all hell upon the planet, Perseus leads a trek to stop him, before beautiful Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) is sacrificed.  The Clash of the Titans remake features the familiar creatures from the original film: Medusa, giant scorpions, harpies, and of course, the Kraken (Bubo is here too in a throwaway cameo).  However, in re-creating a modern update, the filmmakers forgot one vital thing in the process: making it fun to watch.  While there is a cavalcade of action and PG-13 rated violence, this new Clash of the Titans lacks any of the fun elements or charm of its predecessor.  The original film, while cheesy, campy, and oh so dated now, still has a degree of charm to it regardless because it's just plain fun to watch and easy to enjoy.  Here, the story and action are so mindless and boring that it's just hard to keep paying attention.  Acting-wise Worthington is solid, as are Gemma Arterton and Mads Mikkelsen as his allies on his journey, but no one else makes any sort of lasting impression.  The CGI effects are a mix of good and surprisingly sub-par, yet somehow, Perseus' battle with Medusa is worth the price of admission alone.  All in all, this new take on Clash of the Titans may be worthwhile for younger viewers who have no knowledge of the original film, but for the rest of us who grew up with the original Ray Harryhausen-effects featured film, it'd be for the best to just disregard this remake.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G8D1VN3MVB6F.html">A2G8D1VN3MVB6F</a><br/><p>This is a good movie, much better than the previous version with Harry Hamlin. It is was filmed and edited very well and the special effects were very great. The story was mostly focused on action and did not pay attention to the story underlying this movie. It was all chop, chop, chop, then some talk and maybe a little more talk, but then back to chop, chop, chop. All in all, it was not a bad movie. It was just good and entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>A good amount of action and impressive CGI bolsters this remake which to be honest flags a bit at times.<br />Even an A list cast, and Sam Worthington (fresh from Avatar and Terminator Salvation) unfortunately can't lift it above average.<br />The usual debate ensues about the 3D added as an afterthought, and whether it adds anything, I saw the 2D version so can't comment on that, although I noticed a couple of scenes obviously deliberately designed with the 3D medium in mind.<br />On a side note, if 3D is going to be the new gold standard, then please filmmakers, stop using every opportunity to have things fly out of the screen for a cheap effect. Avatar was good in 3D exactly because it did not exploit the audience, but I digress.<br />Most people who remember Harry Hamlin et al in the 1981 original will not be able to help but make comparisons, and the storyline and chronology is quite similar.<br />However, whereas I would not have said the original was a deep drama, it had a far more solid story, and makes this updated CGI festival pale in comparison.<br />As much as I like Sam Worthington, he was wooden most of the time, pausing between action sequences to deliver  "man against the Gods" speeches, which he fails to carry off each time with any conviction.<br />The biggest difference in the two movies is of course that the first was a love story.<br />Perseus, driven by his love for Andromeda (the beautiful and delicate Judy Bowker) has a passion, that is missing here somehow. As Perseus is merely on a vendetta against Hades.<br />The feud and story with Calibos was much more integral to the plot than here also, where this time around that character seems to be little more than a disgruntled mercenary working for Hades.<br />I'm not going to delve into the story any more than that, so no spoilers.<br />It is a good two hours of escapism, and fun to watch Liam Neeson, and Ralph Fiennes as Zeus, and Hades respectively chewing up scenery at every given opportunity.<br />Probably the last of the stop motion classics involving the great Ray Harryhausen, the original movie looks laughable in comparison to today's effects, but as we have seen so often, effects alone don't always mean a great movie.<br />Sure to do well at the box office, it is a visual feast if nothing else, and although I don't agree with some of the scathing reviews it's received from the media, and film critics, it did fall short of my expectations. 3.5 Stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Demi-god Perseus (Sam Worthington), the son of Zeus (Liam Neeson) and a human mother, undertakes a quest to save the city of Argos from the wrath of the Kraken, an enormous sea monster that the gods plan to release as punishment for defiance.<br /><br />Director Louis Leterrier keeps the pace snappy and handles CGI creatures well, as he demonstrated with "The Incredible Hulk."  Some reviewers want more story, but it seems to me that the figures of Greek myth are generally at the mercy of fate and destiny, so I didn't miss the lack of motivations rooted deeply in character.  I also didn't mind the scrambling of mythology, although I wouldn't recommend this movie as a source for college students trying to crank out a term paper on Greek myths at the last minute.  I didn't even mind Perseus's buzzcut in a world where everyone else (even some of the women) have beards and long hair.  At least it's easy to pick him out of a crowd.  The giant scorpions, the Medusa, the harpies, and the Kraken all looked great and the action was exciting enough to keep me happily shoveling popcorn into my mouth.<br /><br />BTW, I elected to see the film in 2D since I had read some bad reviews of the murky look of the film after the last minute decision to switch it to 3D.  "Avatar" demonstrated that 3D technology has finally arrived and is worth the extra bucks when done right.  However, too many Hollywood productions trying to jump onto the bandwagon with substandard product may make moviegoers think twice about paying higher ticket prices.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>The original movie was better. The 2010 remake provides an equal amount of adventure and mythological romaticism.  All of the acting was top notch too.  But they left out (yet paid hommage to) the owl in the original.

Special effects are good and its still entertaining to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>I went into this flick without any point of reference.

Liam Neeson as Zeus is pretty much in paycheck mode and Ralph Fiennes chews the scenery as Hades.  The effects are pretty good and they service the story to a point.  Final verdict it has a good beat and I could dance to it so on a scale of one to ten I give it a six.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>The sword and sandals movies are always a favorite of mine, whether it is complete fantasy or historic.  I liked the original Clash when it was released when I was a kid, now it seems very campy and not as good for me.  This Clash takes a very serious tone, though there are some humorous characters to lighten things up.  Though it is great on big special effects and does follow the path of the original in the basic story, there is something lacking in this movie that I can't put my finger on.  I watched it and did enjoy it, but when it ended it didn't really bring any emotion out of me.  The story ideas seemed good, but not fully complete.  It feels like they just missed with this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2U80IPZXN5V1U.html">A2U80IPZXN5V1U</a><br/><p>Mythology has always interested me even at a young age, the stories of mythical gods and creatures where and still are fascinating to me, Medusa, Pegasus, the Kraken and more.  It was only normal that I wanted to see what this movie made of these legends. This version of Clash of the Titans is a remake of the 1981 movie of the same name. Most film remakes today are criticized for particular reasons and this one falls into that category as well. Of course it's different from the original Class of the Titans, which is good because I don't want to watch a remake that's  exactly like the original, if I did I'd just watch the 1981 movie. As with almost every single remake this one left out some things but followed the story close enough, just not as well perhaps. I don't think this particular remake was awful or that it was excellent but it falls somewhere between the two, a good popcorn movie is a proper way of describing it.<br /><br />CotT follows Perseus, half-man, half-god and son of Zeus lives in a time where man thinks he is bigger than the gods and where prayers are not welcomed. Hades convinces Zeus to let him create conflicts between humans for them to convert back to the gods. Perseus being the son of god is said to be the savior of man and must fights titanic creatures to save his kind. Nothing complicated as far as storytelling goes. What's interesting is Perseus doesn't want to be acknowledged as the son of Zeus, he doesn't embrace his destiny even if he does what is expected of him. Those who are familiar with mythology already know that there some things are not totally accurate but the movie remains an entertaining one if you can get over that fact. The scenes where the action is, the fights against the creatures, are the high points obviously. The scene with Medusa was a highlight for me; I thought it was great that they kept her in the same way as the original.<br /><br />CofT has mostly been slammed by critics and didn't earn high ratings, here on Amazon it is currently rated an average of 3 stars which is a fair rating in my opinion and it is also how I rated the movie. To be honest this remake is entertaining but whereas the visuals were good the film falls short in the story department (I feel the story was executed in a better way in the 1981 version). Clash of the Titans is not a terribly bad movie but it's a little far from completely satisfying and it's hard not to compare with the 1981 original, which I feel is the better one. If you have seen the original or are simply interested in watching it I suggest that you do because it truly isn't as bad as some are reporting it to be, but I would advise to rent before buying. 3/5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AUUH6Z8MSGGF.html">AUUH6Z8MSGGF</a><br/><p><span class="tiny"> Length:: 8:16 Mins<br /><br /></span>The remake of the 1981 classic, "Clash of the Titans" was directed by Louis Leterrier, director of "Transporter 2" and "The Incredible Hulk" (the Edward Norton one). It stars Sam Worthington as Perseus, son of Zeus (Liam Neeson) whose entire human family has been killed by Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and with the help of Io (Gemma Arterton) he is seeking his revenge and attempting to save Argos and the Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalvos).<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Special Features:<br /><br />The Blu-Ray edition is the best way to experience this epic movie heavily based in green screen CGI technology. The most amazing aspect is a feature I've never seen before but think should be in ALL Blu-Ray movies is the Maximum Movie Mode which is a complex picture-in-picture way of watching the film where it will zoom out from the movie itself and put it aside where you can still see it while bringing up another box with scene breakdowns, effects breakdowns, and on-the-spot vignettes all the while you are watching the movie! For example, in one of the beginning scenes you are watching Perseus and his father talking on the fishing boat and at the same time you can see how the boat was built, complications the crew faced in getting it to work, and other behind the scenes moments.<br /><br />Many of my main complaints about the film are recognized in deleted scenes and the alternate ending. For example, I disliked how after all the set-up for Perseus not wanting the gods help that he just got this easy going peace with Zeus at the end. The alternate ending was preferable for me because Perseus goes all the way up to Mount Olympus on his Pegasus to face Zeus in a manly way shrugging him off once and for all. My biggest problem with the movie was that we only focused on two of the gods: Zeus and Hades while all the others stood around and never got to talk. In the deleted scenes, you will find much more character development and dialogue from all the other gods getting involved, having opinions on Zeus's actions, and even one going down to Earth to talk to Perseus and give him the gold coin. At some point in the process, a decision was made to go in the other direction but I think the original idea of having all the others involved was a stronger choice. Another nice thing about getting to see these deleted scenes that aren't completely up to par with the special effects is that you get a chance to admire the shiny, metallic costumes the gods wear that you can barely see with all the glowy effects bling added post production during the film.<br /><br />Another feature praises Sam Worthington as being an "action hero for the ages" mainly highlighting his willingness to do his own stunt work as much as possible. There are many small featurettes on individual aspects of production, but the best way to get that full experience I think is to watch that Maximum Movie Mode which is very thorough and if there's a boring moment, you have the option of going back to watching the movie and ignoring it. Choices are great!</p></br><a href="../users/A82R4WKX62LEK.html">A82R4WKX62LEK</a><br/><p>I WATCHED THE MOVIE 2 TIMES AND THE 1ST TIME I WAS A LITTLE DISAPOINTED. The movie should have been another 40 or so minutes longer. No nudity or profanity or dirty jokes. Just some good action and great special effects. My 2 boys just loved it as i did. The acting was very good. The costumes were great. The only shortfall was the length of the movie. For the life of me i cannot understand why they made the movie so short.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>And once again Hollywood proves it has run out of original ideas. Why else would they remake this movie?<br /><br />Back in 1981, when special effects were beginning to take serious root in films, we had the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q7ZOL2">Clash of the Titans</a>. It had some cheesy claymation mixed with some less cheesy special effects. But it did have a story. A damn good one. Sure there were action sequences, especially when Perseus (Harry Hamlin) met up with Medusa. But these action scenes were barely a few minutes long. The story of the gods, how they felt about humanity (and how humanity felt about them) dominated the storyline. Yes, there was an ACTUAL story.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2010 and you get this ...this ...this mess-of-a-remake that relies almost solely on CGI and, well, basically nothing else.<br /><br />The brief understanding of the god/human relationship is thrust aside in favor of action scenes galore which have squat to do with the story. There are so many throwaway characters as to be laughable. And 3-D? For marketing purposes only. Save yourself some cash and see it in 2-D ...if at all.<br /><br />My son went with me to see it (he's as much of a movie junky as I am) and we both nearly fell asleep for lack of anything approaching a viable understanding of who was carrying the storyline. We still ask each other, "What was the point, again?"<br /><br />Sam Worthington seems to be a hot commodity in today's movie market. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB55I0">Terminator Salvation</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VPE1B6">Avatar</a> are two of his more recent accomplishment. And although I found those two to be lukewarm in terms of story, they at least kept me engaged enough not to yawn. And Liam Neeson has also been splattered all over film posters (from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCUNYO">Taken</a> to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ICLRIE">Kingdom of Heaven</a>). But a god? And Zeus for that matter? Not the best casting choice. He just didn't have the presence I was expecting. Perhaps the story (or lack thereof) stifled his performance. Probably.<br /><br />I also MUST caution women against seeing this if they enjoyed the strong roles in the 1981 original. You'll find no such comparisons here. There's really no good female character to be found. The closest was Alexa Davalos (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB55JO">Defiance</a>) as Perseus' love interest, Andromeda. But her role is so laughably short and misunderstood that you won't care what happens to her (and things do happen).<br /><br />My final word of caution comes to those of us (all of us) struggling in today's economy. We need our escapism, and sometimes (occasionally) Hollywood allows us to have it.  But not here. You might as well sit on the toilet and release the crappen!</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>CLASH OF THE TITANS was perhaps more entertaining as a 3D movie in theaters than it is on the small screen of the home television where the CGI effects are less impressive and at times downright silly. Louis Leterrier directed this remake of the 1981 Olivier/Hamlin epic based on Beverley Cross's take on the struggle for power between the Greek Gods and mankind: this time around the myth is manipulated by Travis Beacham, Phil Hay, and Matt Manfredi who have managed to create dialogue that must have been embarrassing for the actors to speak.  The gods are either surrounded by blinding light or smog-on-a-bad-day smoke and the presence of the creatures of the very mixed up version of the myth range form beautiful Pegasus (flying horses) to a voluptuous Medusa to the bigger than life scorpions and devilish gods to the Kraken who probably wins the contest for most disgusting beastie - though the competition is tough!<br /><br />The story is basically an attempt of Zeus and the gods on Olympus to restore their tainted reputation as being adored and worshiped through the wiles of Perseus who is thwarted by a long standing sibling rivalry victim Hades in Perseus' travels to kill the Medusa and the supposedly indestructible Kraken. It is a tale of men versus kings versus gods versus good and evil.  The very odd aspect of this dark film is the fact that of many of the cast are among the finest actors on the screen. Some are minor actors (Sam Worthington plays Sam Worthington who is placed complete with burr cut in the role of Perseus), but others include Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Hans Matheson, Danny Huston,  Nicholas Hoult, the departed Pete Postlethwaite, Mads Mikkelsen (the strongest in the cast), a very chubby Polly Walker, Elizabeth McGovern, Gemma Arterton - the list goes on and on.<br /><br />Having never seen the original 1981 Clash of the Titans makes comparison impossible, but if the purpose for making this over the edge movie was to test contemporary 3D techniques it probably succeeds. As for the acting and the script - this film is merely a chuckle.

It was good, but I expected more.  With that said up front, I could not wait to see this in the theater, and of course opted for 3D so the creatures  would stand out from the screen.  The Computer Graphic Imaging (CGI) and Animatronics were great!<br /><br />The story begins with a seaman opening a box on his ship that he salvaged from the sea  to find a living baby lying inside on its dead mother's chest.  He takes the baby boy home to raise as his own.  Young Perseus quickly advances to about age 25. As Perseus (Sam Worthington), his mother, father, and younger half-sister are on the ship approaching Argos, they see the huge statue of Zeus being thrown into the sea by the people.<br /><br />Now, let me side-step a minute.  Zeus (Liam Neeson) was the mythological god in charge of the humans. Zeus loved mankind, but mankind was getting a bit tired of honoring the gods all the time and still having to suffer and die.  Zeus also has an evil brother named Hades (Ralph Fiennes) who is in charge of the Underworld.  Calibos lives down there with Hades.<br /><br />Another side-step is that we find out that Perseus is a demigod (half god and half man).  Zeus came down one day, disguised as Calibos and made love to his queen, impregnating her with a son (Perseus).  King Calibos sealed his queen and the baby in a wooden coffin and they were thrown into the sea.  The baby lived, as we saw earlier, and Calibos went to the Underworld for his crimes.<br /><br />Back to the story--now the humans have upset their sponsor, Zeus. The sea begins to rise and Perseus' family all perish in the sea.  He is rescued and taken to Argos, where he meets Princess Andromeda and her family.<br /><br />Back on Mt. Olympus, the Council of gods are having a big meeting.  Hades is just dying to get at the humans with The Kraken, because Hades takes his strength from the people's fear, while Zeus takes his from their love.  Hades says, "Zeus, can I get after the people?"  and Zeus allows Hades to do his thing because the people have shunned the gods of Mt. Olympus.  So Hades appears in Argos, telling the King he has dishonored the gods.  Either sacrifice the princess to the Kraken in 10 days or Argos will be destroyed.  Perseus and the small army of Argos set off on a journey to find out how to kill the Kraken before the 10 days are up so he can save Andromeda.  Zeus sends his son a few special gifts now and then to help him on his journey, such as a special sword and a black-winged Pegasus.  On their journey, they meet giant scorpions, the jin people, and search for Medusa (whose very gaze turns any living creature into stone.)<br /><br />This is a neat movie to see in 3D and on the big screen.  It was filmed in Tenerife, UK, the Canary Islands, and Etheopia.<br /><br />If you have never seen this movie, I highly recommend that you catch the 1981 version, whether you see this 2010 one or not.  If you want both, I recommend you see the 2010 one first.  Both stories follow the same script pretty closely but the 1981 version has a lot more to the story.  I also liked Sam Worthington in this type of action role.  I look forward to seeing him in future action movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>Clash of the Titans is essentially a watered down version of a live-action adaptation of the God of War video game.

A God of War film is pointless now unless they decide to do a full-blown R-rated version of it.<br /><br />Certain other things about the film really bugged me. The main one being that the two main female characters Io and Andromeda cried at EVERYTHING. Every time they spoke it was like they started getting teary eyed. "Oh Perseus, I can't follow you into Medusa's lair since I'm not a big strong man like you are. *sob*" Just made me want to slap them and go, "GET A GRIP, LADY! SHEESH!" The biggest pet peeve of mine lies in the finale of the film. Everything regarding Hades and the kraken are dealt with so quickly. The film makes a huge deal about both of them only to have everything wrapped up in less than five minutes when the time finally comes. It just wound up feeling very rushed and anticlimactic.<br /><br />Despite all of the things I found wrong with the film, there were some high points. The CG seemed very all or nothing to me. At times, the effects were fantastic. The giant scorpions scene and the kraken being the best examples. Pegasus is also a great example. The winged horses looked fairly genuine, but they looked kind of odd when they flew. Other times though, it seemed way too obvious that the characters were standing in front of a green screen and fighting with creatures that weren't actually there. There's a scene near the beginning where we first see Perseus as an adult where his father is talking to him and a thunderstorm is beginning to brew. The sky was obviously CG. There were just several moments like that that brought me out of the film.<br /><br />Clash of the Titans was one of the most anticipated blockbusters of the year, but fell short and wound up being one of the most disappointing. With mediocre special effects, a sloppy finale, and female characters that will get on your last nerve, the action film fails to live up to expectations. At the end of the day, Clash of the Titans is basically just a glorified Xena: Warrior Princess.</p></br><a href="../users/ANEDXRFDZDL18.html">ANEDXRFDZDL18</a><br/><p>This was a lackluster and at times cheesy remake of Clash of the Titans which only loosely follows the myth of Perseus. In this version, Zeus imprisons his brother Hades, (for no real apparent reason),  in the underworld. Hades, obviously angry at this betrayal is the bad guy and seeks revenge on Zeus. A mortal king, Acrisius,lays siege to mount Olympus- just because I guess. Zeus, to teach him a lesson has sex with Acrisius's wife Danae- although since this is Zeus we are talking about he rarely needs any reason to shag anyone. Danae conceives Perseus. Enraged, the king kills his wife, but Perseus, being a demi-god, survives and is raised by a fisherman and his family.<br /><br />Perseus, (Sam Worthington) sporting a crewcut and a tunic, is adopted by a fisherman and lives an uneventful life troubled only by bouts of chest pains when it rains. Eventually his past catches up to him, and his family is killed in the crossfire by Hades.  Vowing revenge, Perseus decides to kill Hades to avenge his family. Together with a bland group of red shirt extras heroes, he agrees to help Andromeda to get revenge on Hades, (saving her life is just coincidental to his plan).<br /><br />What can I say? The film was not that great. Sam Worthington was a poor choice for Perseus. He looked far too modern. He is supposed to be a Greek, but he looks and acts like a secret service agent.. His acting was bland and unconvincing. Andromeda who is supposed to be prettier than Aphrodite seemed quite plain, and the inclusion of the giant scorpions as riding beasts was perhaps the cheesiest thing I have seen in a while.  I did like the portrayal of Medusa as beautiful. Most of the cast, except for Perseus just waits around for their turn to die and added very little to the overall plot.<br /><br />Overall, while this was watchable and the action enough to keep anyone from being bored, I thought the filmmakers were simply going through the motions. None of the characters really had any soul and alterations to the story which were made, such as: the silly anti-diety sentiment shared by Acrisius and Perseus, IO as a love interest, the scorpions etc. didn't really didn't add anything to the plot. This was a weak film which suffered from a poor screenplay, and screenwriter conceit. A better writer, and less deviation from the source material would've helped a lot.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>The plot is a bit more than thin in CLASH OF THE TITANS. The 'heroes' are petty, and pouting, and the 'gods' are only interesting because of the actors that are portraying them ( especially Fienes as Hades ). However, the CGI is great, and the only time it's not fun to watch is when the majority of the characters are opening their mouths instead of hacking at monsters. Anyone that seriously anticipated that this remake of the less-than-classic 1981 fantasy of the same name would be anything other than an action-packed, visually pleasing head-rush of a popcorn pic will be seriously disappointed. If you're looking for accuracy in a mythological context, or acting on a par with Tracey, or March in INHERIT THE WIND you won't be happy either.</p></br><a href="../users/AW1493ZQTQ2ET.html">AW1493ZQTQ2ET</a><br/><p>This is basically an action movie drawing on ancient Greek mythology.  In that regard, it's interesting that Zeus created the human race, and yet he depends on human worship for his immortality while being unable to force humans to worship. Why this dependency?  On top of that, his demigod son Perseus prefers to live as a mortal human, even though he has the choice of living as an immortal god ...<br /><br />Anyway, the movie is reasonably entertaining, though the action isn't enough to increase your heart rate much, if at all.  The special effects and scenery are good though, again, not best in class.  And the acting is likewise decent, with some well-known actors in the movie, though they don't have much to work with in terms of story or characters.  In short, not a total waste of time, but certainly not a movie I'd want to watch again.<br /><br />Last but not least, my wife picked this out as a "family" movie, but be forewarned that the level of violence is probably too much for young children (hence the PG-13 rating).</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>There's a whole slew of computer-generated creatures in this remake, but the most stunning visual is Gemma Arterton, a one-time Bond Girl whose eyes glint and puddle up as Io, the muse and demigoddess guide to Perseus (Sam Worthington) in this well-worn tale of Greek mythology. No surprises in this 90-minute quickie, aside from an awful turn as Hades from Ralph Fiennes, who appears to have swallowed a pill of Insta-Queeze, which is quite different from underworld menace.<br /><br />Perseus, son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), is a terribly grim sort, having lost his family in the war between men and gods. Reluctantly but without mercy, he slays a variety of beasts, chats up Io and eventually wins a showdown inside Medusa's lair with the help of a scorpion shield. Then it's on to the Kraken, which the audience never quite sees in full before it's turned to stone.<br /><br />Worthington appears headed for a lifetime of cop and soldier-of-fortune roles, while Arterton - with another upcoming starring role in Jerry Bruckheimer's beefcake epic "Prince of Persia" - is headed for the A-list. A British accent, toothy grin and hair that looks great thrown into ancient Scrunchies? I smell the second coming of Rachel Weisz.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>'Clash of The Titans' was one of those movies that came out in the zany 80s. Like most of those movies they were fun to watch, but if you wanted them to be these great epics you had to turn to very crude special effects. With where we are right now in film making we can do almost anything from Dinosaurs, to transforming robots. So, naturally why not take some of these old honky-tonk 80s epics and turn them into something amazing?!<br /><br />Clash of the Titans was a good choice to give one of these modern day makeovers to. The epic battles with mythical Greek monsters in this day and age would look incredible...and they did. Still, the guys who gave this movie a makeover sort of forgot to finish the job. The movie was lacking extremely of acting talent, character development and story. Now I went to see this movie in the theaters because the action sequences looked great and yes they were. During the softer points in the movie I was flat out bored. The acting was bland, and even though Liam Neason and Ralph Finnes brought all they could to the table and they did a decent job, it still just didn't seem to work. Also the movie while it paced quite well, it just went a little too fast. I thought that the battles with the giant scorpions and Medusa just went way too quickly I completely didn't know there was a fight going on. Don't even get me started on the Kraken battle...I don't even know if there was a battle with the Kraken because I think the movie ended right when it finally showed up on the screen.<br /><br />A great deal of film appreciators feel that re-making films is a bad idea, I say yes and no, because let's face it do you really think that a kid born after 1990 is going to ask his/her mom or dad to rent the 1981 'Clash of the Titans'? Odds are no, so why not bring some of these movies to the modern day, clean them up add some great effects and there you have it. Still, when you decide that this is a movie you want to re-do make you actually make it better than the original! Not the same and definitely not worse. 'Clash of Titans' is nothing but an epic of failure. Still, I am glad that I did see it and I am glad that the things I expected in the film to be good were and that's why I gave it 2 stars.<br /><br />Oh on a personal note, supposedly there is a re-make of 'The NeverEnding Story' in the works....GET GUERLLMO DelTORO ON THE PHONE....PLEASE!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>The more I think about the new "Clash of the Titans", the more ticked off I get. Shortly after it became apparent that "Avatar" would become a huge success, breaking box office records, Warner Brothers decided to make a change to "Clash of the Titans", their big budget remake of the 1981 cult favorite. Their new version, starring Sam Worthngton (also in "Avatar") was scheduled for release over the last weekend of March. But a large reason for the phenomenal success of "Avatar" is the premium charged for the 3-D screenings. Most theaters charge $5 extra for the glasses at a 3-D screening. A very significant portion of the tickets sold for the James Cameron phenomenon were for 3-D or IMAX screenings, pumping up the box office totals. Warner Brothers decided to 'retrofit' "Clash of the Titans", a film already completed in 2-D, for 3-D screenings. They found out the bare minimum of time it would take and pushed back their release date one week, so they wouldn't have to compete with Dreamworks' animated "How To Train Your Dragon", also a big (and better) 3-D release. I was one of the first people to rush to the theaters to see "The Nightmare Before Christmas" when it was re-released in 3-D, so I figured this retrofit would be acceptable.<br /><br />I figured wrong.<br /><br />"Clash of the Titans" is never going to be considered a great film, either version. Film enthusiasts remember the 1981 version as a late example of the great Ray Harryhausen's work. Harryhausen was a stop motion animator who created creatures and effects for a number of films like "Jason and the Argonauts" and "The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad". The story is too inherently campy, historically inaccurate and the films are filled with too many actors of varying skill trying to play against one another. But this new film would have been a perfectly serviceable popcorn film, fun for a night out, fun to share with friends and then go and have a dinner where you laugh and discuss the antics of the characters and the story.<br /><br />But because it was retrofitted for 3-D, and in a time frame that was apparently rushed, the film looks awful. I read one reviewer who commented that you will feel like you want to take your glasses off throughout the film. This was the problem with the old 3-D process. It wasn't very good and it bothered people with glasses or imperfect eyesight. The new process is a vast improvement, making almost everything look realistic and believable, like we are actually watching real life unfold before us. So why on Earth would we want to take a step backwards? Especially after we have had the opportunity to witness what gifted filmmakers can do in the medium. Films like "Avatar" and PIXAR's "Up" both demonstrate what this medium has the potential to achieve.<br /><br />"Clash of the Titans" is likely to make a lot of people think twice before plunking down the extra money for 3-D again. Throughout the film, it looks like they took two copies of the same characters and placed a slightly enlarged version in back of the actual image. Liam Neeson plays Zeus and he sports a wild mane of black hair cascading over his head and down his back. Frequently, when he turns slightly, it looks like his back is enlarging and he resembles Hagrid, played by Robbie Coltrane in the "Harry Potter" films. The 3-D process does nothing but make the film look more fake and unbelievable, drawing attention to the fact much of the film is created with computer animation. Because of this, we start paying a lot of scrutiny to everything and very little holds up. Everything begins to appear unrealistic and that is completely the opposite of what 3-D should do.<br /><br />In a later scene, Worthington's Perseus is riding Pegasus to a battle with the Kraken. Clearly, the actor is not riding an actual flying horse, but you have to go into these films willing to suspend a certain amount of belief. So, Worthington is riding a CGI creation and the 3-D process draws our eyes to the way his head is moving in direct opposition to his torso and his legs. He looks like an action figure who is being posed for stop motion animation. Only instead of capturing a change every frame, to make it appear more fluid, it looks like they make a change every five, ten or fifteen frames, making it appear jerky.<br /><br />Acting is never the strong point in films like this; the subject matter seems too inherently silly. We aren't there to see great acting, we are there to see what we hope might be a fairly believable adventure story, an adventure story enhanced by the 3-D and computer generated graphics. As discussed, the 3-D and the computer-generated graphics are out, so our eyes and our attention turn to other areas and begin to scrutinize. That other area is the acting. Liam Neeson headlines as Zeus, the God who is disappointed with the human race and enters into a deal with Hades, played by Ralph Fiennes. Hades and Zeus are brothers but Hades has a chip on his shoulder and a grudge to bear because Zeus tricked him. Each is acceptable, but when you also remember both actors were in "Schindler's List", you have to wonder why they would be interested in this film. Clearly, they had some bills to pay. They look suitably solemn and grave, and otherworldly throughout. In fact, after Hades gives the people an ultimatum, he hovers on a black cloud, moving back towards the door. Why does Hades need to use a door? Honestly, all I could think of was Ursula, the octopus sea witch from the animated classic "The Little Mermaid".<br /><br />Sam Worthington has been cast in a number of films based on his anointment by James Cameron. He made "Terminator Salvation" and "Clash" after "Avatar". Honestly, he has been kind of dull and forgettable in all of the films.<br /><br />The rest of the gods aren't even identified and only one has a line or two. This "Clash" is all about Perseus, Zeus and Hades. But Perseus flies into battle because he is protecting Andromeda (Alexa Davalos, "The Mist", TV's "Reunion", "The Chronicles of Riddick"). Davalos never changes her expression throughout the film and looks like she is in pain. Why does he even care about her? She's pretty but he seems to meet her when we do and they never have a conversation let alone an intimate moment, they never seem to bond.<br /><br />Mads Mikkleson ("Casino Royale"), Pete Postlethwhaite, Elizabeth McGovern, Polly Walker (HBO's "Rome", TV's "Caprica") and many others pop up for a few moments and then disappear.<br /><br />A completely forgettable mess made all the more forgettable by bad 3-D. This "Clash" seems a gift from Hades himself.</p></br><a href="../users/A29TKSIWA3JKF3.html">A29TKSIWA3JKF3</a><br/><p>Since I like the original film more, I'll not suffer to make any comparisons (as this wasn't a very faithful adaption in any regard, the matter is moot).  I'll just say that I also liked this "same titled movie" and leave it at that.  Besides, any movie with Pete Postlethwaite in it already has a lot going for it.  The man was stellar.<br />What is impressive about this new version is its darker, grubby/grimy look.  It wasn't as pristine as most costume action flicks.  It was also populated by a surly lot (gods and mortals alike, everyone seemed miffed about something), for some reason I found that amusing.  Plus, there were those great monsters, a snakier Medusa, and of course the Kraken.  Loved the star field opening sequence (which I assume was spectacular in 3D).  Since I never saw the 3D version of this film, that isn't an issue for me, I took this film as it was presented: not great, but good enough.  I was entertained.  (I'm very basic that way.)<br />If I have a complaint, it's slight: the owl.  As that owl played a major role in the original film, but was only a brief toss-off in this one, I'm left wondering why it was included: homage or for mocking purposes?  Then too, there was Sam Worthington's (ahem) acting.  I know he spent a great deal of print space bragging how much better this version was then the old film and that he most certainly did NOT want to work with THAT owl...  Those considerations aside, Sam was the only character/actor I couldn't vividly recall after viewing the movie.  He scowled a lot, I remember that, but he lacked presence.  So it's a little disappointing to learn he'll reprise Perseus for the sequel (and possible third film?).  Hopefully by then he'll have realized that even a little personality goes a long way.<br />I will be keeping this film for my collection, but it will NOT go on the same shelf as the original!  No point in adding insult to injury.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Some great visuals, especially with the Kraken and the giant scorpions, though not much of a story here.

When I grew up a bit, like say, in middle school, I knew exactly what I wanted. I wanted a remake of the film that was so cheesy and yet so lovable. Sooo more than a decade later, I finally got my wish-or not.<br /><br />The remake of Clash is appallingly bad, and not in a cheesy way. It is just bad. Everything about it is worthless. The characters are pointless and have no redeaming qualities, the Gods are completely underutalized. The plot is non-existant and really doesn't make any sense. Andromeda may as well have been written out of the script since her appearance in the film had NO purpose. The CGI is OK but man do I wish for the old Medusa. The list goes on and on. The acting is the only saving grace here. And I'm pretty much talking about Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson. They commanded the screen in their small, pointless roles. Sam Worthington does a good job, but nobody CARES about his character. He comes off as arrogant and unworthy of anything.<br /><br />There is no soul to this film. It is just bits of action scenes sewn together for entertainment purposes. I was so frustrated and aggravated after the ending because after literally years of hoping and waiting, the final outcome is just plain garbage. Perhaps my expectations were too high but maybe if the creators spent more time on the actual plot and less on trying to make this film 3D, then just maybe it would have turned out decent. Or maybe not.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>I loved the Clash of the Titans as a child and I still enjoy it. I decided to ignore the film critics and see this thing. See people told me not to pay attention to critics. Never mind a 20% or so rotten rating at rotten tomatoes, for example. They got my 10 bucks. And couple hours I'll never get back. I have noting good to say about this thing. Elements of what goes into a decent film are not present. Of all the mediocre and terrible remakes this ranks at the bottom.<br />Edit (04/07): A little more.<br />The first pre-cgi, pre-video game paradigm movie had a stillness to it and reality that only real sets can achieve. And a stillness brought to the screen during a time when people could sit in a theater and pay attention without busting out with brightly shinning phones to text message.<br /><br />Seems like people younger than late 20s don't even notice.<br /><br />Did you notice the tranquility on Mt. Olympus? Sure the set sucked, but for its time it was good and *what matters now is it doesn't feel like a video game*.<br /><br />Laurence Olivier's performance has lasted. Liam Neeson's will not. Why?<br /><br />And who made a better hero Harry Hamlin or the Avatar manikin?<br /><br />And what about the old playwright played by Burgess Meredith of Rocky and tv series Batman fame (as The Penguin)? He largely made the movie for me. Compare the playwright to the immortal whatever-she-was that I guess was meant to take his place as a sort of story guide or something (Never mind she dies too, which is another idiotic plot hole).</p></br><a href="../users/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH.html">A2KWQ64TRHB3YH</a><br/><p>Since the many other reviews addressed the drama of the film, I will address another question. The clash between the gods and the humans, according to this film, was caused by the gods noticing that the humans stopped praying to them. The gods created the humans so that they would pray to them, and they need the prayers. The prayers make them stonger.<br /><br />The pagans offered many reasons why the gods created humans. One, for example, was that they needed slave labor. But this tale says that the gods needed prayers. What do we think today? Does God need prayers?<br /><br />Most people today would reject this notion. God, they would say, is perfect and needs nothing. Then why pray? Prayer, they say, helps humans in various ways.<br /><br />Yet, people will be surprised to learn that not only some ancient pagans thought that God needs prayers, but there were and are Christians, Muslim, and Jews that thought and think so as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LAA9SCENXLKN.html">A2LAA9SCENXLKN</a><br/><p>For all my reviews visit my website<br /><br />I am NOT reviewing the DVD. Just the movies unless otherwise stated.<br /><br />Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.<br /><br />This movie impressed me, I was impressed (person comes in room) *cough*redundant*cough*. But first, if you don't like it when people take plots from the original and totally replace them (re-imagining,) then this isn't the one for you.<br /><br />Contrary to popular belief, this is not just CGI. It is also mind-numbing action. Just kidding. Well it does have that quality, it is very smart. First off, the film pays a lot of homage to the original, keeping everything in. What is not in the main plot makes a cameo *cough*I WANT THAT MECHANICAL OWL!!!!*cough.* It also has some symbolism, more on that later.<br /><br />So there, the CGI is awesome. I said it, I'll say it again. This CGI beats Avatar, it is up there with War of the Worlds and Jurassic Park. Maybe even better (THAT'S A STRETCH THOUGH.) But seriously, some of the best CGI I've seen in a while. Have you noticed that all the characters look very, very modern. Not even trying to resemble the original? PERSEUS LOOKS LIKE HE JOINED THE MARINES!!! (Perseus, Marines...worst joke ever...but seriously...laugh Jake...laugh.)<br /><br />Okay, I'll admit it, the stop-motion of the original cannot be beat. Also, the CGI monsters have very different colors and patterns then the original. (As you can see with the Kraken.) For instance, the scorpion and pegasus for that matter are both black, when in the original pegasus was white and scorpion was yellow. Scorpion is also MUCH bigger in this film. Pegasus is joined by white horses, and is much bigger. The scorpion does have a more realistic pattern. But, I gotta stop, CAUSE I'M INSULTING HARRYHAUSEN! GOD DANG IT! SOMEBODY PUNISH ME!!!<br /><br />I like the inclusion of Hades, and just the whole plot is very different, and great. So, I can't compare which is better, there both very different films. It'd be like comparing The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms and Godzilla. I know Godzilla is based off Beast, but there both very different. I will say that the replacement of the Seagull with the Eagle is both a good and a bad. Eagle being the US symbol, but Seagull being more loose and saying "GOOD TIME PEOPLEZ! HERE COMES BOB MARLEY!" "Three Little Birds, hopping on my doorstep...singing sweet songs..." etc. But the Eagle says "BOOM! HERE COMES SALIVA!"  "BOOM! DO YOU WANT IT? BOOM! DO YOU NEED IT? BOOM! LEMME HEAR IT! Ladies and Gentlemen..." etc.<br /><br />It felt shorter than what it was, it felt like maybe 1.5-2.5 hours but it's 3 hours and 2 minutes. [P.S. I am sorry I am not reporting the 3-D, I got ripped off at the theater. YOU CAN ACCOMMODATE SEIZURES, BUT WE ASPERGERS PEOPLEZ NEED IT TOO!) I might add something on the 3-D another day, since I've been offered a treat by one of my friends. They feel my pain. How does that song go? "Nobody knows the trouble I've seen....Nobody knows my sorrow..." (I hope you can see me laughing while I typed that.) (I've been quoting a lot of songs in this review.)<br /><br />All in all, a great film. I can't compare it too the original, but it is close enough to deserve that title. Clash of the Titans.<br /><br />P.S. PERSEUS IS THE SON OF POSEIDON, NOT ZEUS!!!!!!<br /><br />The Rating? Heck, what the heck, 4.2/5.<br /><br />I, Da Ca$hman signing off.</p></br><a href="../users/ALLIGF5OZM1I6.html">ALLIGF5OZM1I6</a><br/><p>CLASH OF THE TITANS<br /><br />STARRING: Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Gemma Arterton, Jason Flemyng, Alexa Davalos, , Mads Mikkelsen, Natalia Vodianova, Luke Evans, Izabella Miko, Danny Houston and Nicholas Hoult<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Travis Beacham, Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi; based on the screenplay by Beverly Cross<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Louis Leterrier<br /><br />Rated: PG - 13<br />Genre: Action / Fantasy<br />Release Date: 02 April 2010<br />Review Date: 17 April 2010<br /><br />There are so many, that I think I'll just bunch all of my questions up together at the beginning and get it over with. Why does Perseus have a shaved head when everyone else in the film has the appropriate hairstyle for the time period? Why did they CGI Medusa? Why does Calibos look like he belongs in Wrong Turn rather than this film? Why does Hades walk with a staggered limp and have such a dramatic dry voice and a burnt scalp? Why does Zeus need to wear armor while sitting upon his throne in Olympus? Why did everyone feel the need to engrave abs into their armor? Were they really that bored? I know they didn't have cable or Nintendo back then, but come on! And lastly, why was this film re-made at all? It's a Saturday morning classic B-rate 80's flick and that's the way we like it. It's not a CGI infested Hollywood Blockbuster, and attempting to make it so, was a disappointment.<br /><br />But who knows - perhaps Clash of the Titans would have made a good huge Hollywood film, had they done it right. If they had stepped away from the cheesiness of the original altogether, and started fresh - maybe we'd have something. Instead, what we are left with is a sorry attempt and what feels like a collaboration between the corny appeal of the classic, breaded with special effects and this goes together about as good as lasagna and cocoa puffs would.<br /><br />Having never seen the original, my friend leaned over, about 10 minutes in and whispered in my ear, "Why does this feel like we're watching a bad 70's flick?" If memory serves, this was right around the time where Zeus' metal armor was ridiculously gleaming and shining at us like something out of a bad rock video. I smiled to myself and informed her, that we essentially were - as the original was released in 1981, and this version was caked with its long since dried-over cheese.<br /><br />The original is one of my favorite films. It's fantastic. It's a cult classic and is so bad, that is in turn so good; if that makes any sense at all! It's extra jam-packed-filled with B-rate dialogue, B-rate sets and of course, glorious old school stop animated sequences and corny props. Somehow, the giant scorpions looked more convincing in the original.<br /><br />Both films have almost the exact same story; the only major difference being that the orders of events have been randomly shuffled around to appear in a different sequence. And this new version offers Hades as the lead villain, when Calibos was the one causing havoc for Perseus in the original. He still appears here, but looks nothing like he did previously and is only in the film for a small amount of time.<br /><br />While I wasn't a fan of the haircut, even though it fits Sam Worthington every bit as Vin Diesel's fits him; Worthington still delivers a great performance as Perseus. He's a gifted actor and is only getting better.<br /><br />It's also no shocker that Liam Neeson makes for a good Zeus. If I had to picture what God would look like in the form of a man, it would be Neeson all the way. There is something truly majestic about the guy.<br /><br />Had I not recently seen Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightening Thief, maybe I would not have been so disappointed with the Medusa sequence Clash offers us; but I highly doubt it. In Percy Jackson, Medusa was brilliantly played by Uma Thurman and the CGI snakes that were her hair were astronomically more impressive.<br /><br />In addition to this, there was far more depth given to Uma's version of the character, throughout a stimulating scene of dialogue exchanged between her and Percy. No such scene is found in the Clash of the Titans and the CGI is weak and tiresome.<br /><br />The entire flow of Percy Jackson, was better executed and although each scene served primarily to set up the following scene as our hero marched on with his purpose much like Perseus does here; it never felt that way. Clash of the Titans spoon-feeds us one sequence after another like we are a newborn strapped in a highchair. We're not children; we can handle a little more drama. Which of these two films was aimed at kids again?<br /><br />The one thing Clash of the Titans got almost perfect was its climax. Very awesome CGI during the Kraken's scene. Amazing stuff here. Great water-swooping camera shots, and a lot going on at once and the thing was just great to watch as it emerged from the water to reek havoc.<br /><br />The only problem with this scene is that it seems like they spent so much money on making the Kraken look sensational, that they had none left to close the film out with. We go from the Kraken to what should have been an even bigger showdown, to the credits.<br /><br />If you can watch both films and compare them, then great; but if you have to choose between this film and Percy Jackson... I trust you know what to do.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Clash Of The Titans" is great! This is how the story goes: The ultimate struggle for power pits men against kings and kings against gods. But the war between the gods themselves could destroy the world. Born of a god but raised as a man, Perseus is helpless to save his family from Hades, vengeful god of the underworld. With nothing left to lose, Perseus volunteers to lead a dangerous mission to defeat Hades before he can seize power from Zeus and unleash hell on earth. Leading a daring band of warriors, Perseus sets off on a perilous journey deep into forbidden worlds. Battling unholy demons and fearsome beasts, he will only survive if he can accept his power as a god, defy his fate and create his own destiny.<br /><br />The cast led by Sam Worthington (as Persus) is great! The directing by Louis Leterrier (who also directed "Unleashed" (2005), "Transporter 2" (2005) & "The Incredible Hulk" (2008) is great!

The film editing by David Freeman & Vincent Tabaillon (who also did the film editing to "The Incredible Hulk" & "Transporter 2") is great! The casting by Elaine Grainger (who also did the casting to "1408" (2007) & Lucinda Syson (who also did the casting to "The Fifth Element" (1997), "Spy Game" (2001), "The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen" (2003), "Troy" (2004), "Batman Begins" (2005), "Syriana" (2005), "V For Vendetta" (2006), "Children Of Men" (2006), "The Bank Job" (2008) & the upcoming "Kick-Ass" (2010) is great! The production design by Martin Laing (who also did the production design to "Terminator: Salvation" (2009, which also starred Worthington) is great! The art direction by Patricio M.

Sam Worthington is on a roll with the films he is doing. This is just as fun as "300" (2007) or "Troy" (2004).</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>I have always been fascinated by legends and myths of ancient Greece the way they were retold from the ancient epic and lyric poems, and I could spend hours counting the liberties taken with the famous legends in the new action adventure Clash of the Titans (2010) but I will only mention few of them. Zeus, the king of gods did not appear seduce the mother of Perseus, the main character of the film, in the form of her husband, Acrisius. Acrisius was the father of Danae, who was predicted to be killed by her son. Frightened Acrisius imprisoned Danae in a bronze chamber open to the sky in the courtyard of his palace. Zeus entered the chamber in the form of golden rain, and from that union Perseus was born. After several generations, Zeus would disguise himself as a husband of another beautiful woman, Alcmene, resulting in birth of the greatest Greek hero, Hercules. The guardian angel of Perseus in the film, the beautiful woman named Io, was according the legend his foremother, from who the greatest heroes of Greece would descend.  Io died long before the birth of Perseus, and simply could not accompany him in his journey.  As a matter of fact, Perseus was on his quest for the head of Medusa Gorgona alone, and two his half-siblings had helped him, the gods Athena and Hermes. Perseus from the legend never was depicted as the rebel against Gods and the fighter for the human rights. The Legend of Perseus is so beautiful and poetic that it deserves to be filmed without deviation and strange changes.  I never understood why every director and screenwriter who decided to make yet another adaptation of the well known legends should add some preposterous changes to them? One more thing - what with the title? The Titans, also known as the elder gods, were the children of Gaea, the Earth goddess and Uranus, the sky god. The Titans ruled the earth before the Olympians with Zeus as their leader overthrew them and banished them to Tartarus, a place deep beneath even the underworld, dark, sunless and gloomy.  There are no titans in the movie and evidently, no clash of the Titans.  And it's been notice by many viewers that the Kraken was not even the monster from Greek mythology but from the Scandinavian. The huge dragon that was sent as the punishment for the queen Cassiopeia's vanity belonged to Poseidon and had no name.  But even these liberties with the source material are not the main problem of the film. The 3D effects, the main reason why I went to see it in the theater, were of poor quality - images had double edges and were unclear. Only after return from the cinema, I found out that the movie was not filmed in 3D but converted after the filming was over. To make it 3D, was the rushed decision, and as the result, did not add to the watching experience but made it worse. The film boasts a lot of action scenes, fast and furious but they were shot by a shaky camera and primarily cause a headache. I personally liked only one action scene, the battle with the Gorgon Medusa. To give a monster so terrifying that a glimpse at her would turn any creature into stone, Natalia Vodyanova's face, one of the most beautiful and adored faces in the world was a cute idea.  My advice - wait for the DVD but  if you  have to see it in the theater, save yourself the money and see the 2D version which I've heard is pretty decent visually. And do not say you have not been warned.</p></br><a href="../users/A3BJDFGSLXFB36.html">A3BJDFGSLXFB36</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed the original 1981 version when I was a kid and I still enjoy it now. I still pop the DVD in the player for a watch from time to time. The FX are dated and cheesy and some of the performances are a little over the top, but the original version had such a charm and quailty that makes it somewhat of a classic for Hollywood's golden age of summer blockbusters.<br /><br />Now for the newest "remake".<br /><br />Well, first off, let's start with the star, Sam Worthington (Terminator:Salvation and Avatar). Sam is a stoic, passionless and expressionless actor. Think William Shatner on downers. His Marine Corps high-and-tight hairdo ruins all credibility and believability of the character of Perseus and his performance is exactly the same as his performances in his previous films. They didn't even TRY to make him look Greek or, at the very least, European.<br /><br />Liam Neeson, usually a fine actor, struts about as the immortal Zues spouting out ham-fisted dialogue and chewing up the scenery. He looks like he is still dressed in his costume from "Excalibur". What a waste of a fine actor.<br /><br />The whole film seems to be focused on action rather than plot or character developement. Some characters simply show up and really have nothing whatsoever to do rather than take up screen time. Also, this version completely ignores the actual mythology that it derives from (so did the original, only not quite as much as the 2010 version).<br /><br />The FX were decent enough, but as it goes all to often in Hollywood lately, they aren't enough to salvage a weak script, bad acting and bad casting. The FX are the only reason that this film rates two stars in my book.<br /><br />My summary opinion, rent (or buy) the original and enjoy a much more satisfying movie-going experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7.html">A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7</a><br/><p>I didn't really care for this movie at all. It didn't have as much action as I expected, it actually seemed kinda slow and boring. I had a hard time following the story, too. And I didn't care for any of the characters. It was just... Meh... -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></br><a href="../users/AFV2584U13XP3.html">AFV2584U13XP3</a><br/><p>I've seen a lot of bad reviews of the movie but after watching it myself with a low expectation it turned out to not be as awful as I've read.  If you're expecting a great story telling live action remake of the previous 80's version than yes there is going to be some disappointment but if you keep the feeling of expectation to a middle than you'll be more entertained than you'd expect.  Unlike the 80's version this one gives more storyplots with the gods side than the previous one did especially with the sibling rivalry between Hades and Zeus about the fate of humanity and the gods role in it,  also while the new actor who plays Perseus isn't bad personally I preferred Harry Hamlin for the role but that is again because I grew up from watching the 80's version multiple times.  The CGI effects were good not spectacular but still pretty good especially for the new variation of the Kraken.  So if you already have the 80's movie of this and for the price it's going for now I say just add this one to your movie collection you'll not be disappointed....</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>At the risk of not so much swimming against the tide as against a tidal wave, I thought the much-despised 2010 remake of Clash of the Titans was a terrific entertainment that managed to improve on many aspects of the now much-loved but itself initially disparaged Ray Harryhausen version. For a start it's barely a remake, sharing only the title and the subject matter, discarding the love story and family-friendly elements for an altogether grittier and bleaker view that's at least more true to the cruelty of Greek mythology even if the details aren't so well served.<br /><br />If Sam Worthington's Perseus is a throwback to the typical beefcake hero of 50s peplum, the script at least is smarter than the average mythological adventure. Instead of than fulfilling a divine destiny, this version's demi-god Perseus - half man, half-god, all-Ocker - is raging against it, determined to defy the gods as a man. These gods are cruel and parasitic, dependent on the worship of men to fuel their immortality but unwilling to earn it, their arrogance sparking a war with the mortals who don't want them any more. Rather than taking a Richard Dawkins "there is no god" approach, this is more of a "the gods exist and they're a right bunch of bastards" attack, with the dawning realisation that they can ultimately kill them by denying them their prayers. The film does copout on this with the end used in the film, the Blu-ray offering an alternate but poorly executed original version that saw Liam Neeson's Zeus and Perseus still very much at loggerheads, and by losing the love story between Perseus and Andromeda it does lower the stakes somewhat. Perseus' quest is now fuelled by pride, arrogance and defiance, with an impressively bitter Mads Mikkelsen and his high-testosterone expendable Argonauts all manly men meeting manly deaths at the hands and claws and tentacles of mythological beasts.<br /><br />The beasts themselves are generally a pretty impressive bunch, the CGi faring much better in the original 2D than in the clumsily converted 3D version released in cinemas. If Ralph Fiennes' Hades is better as a special effect than when overdoing the Uriah Heap routine in more human form, the impressively rendered giant scorpions, multi-tentacled Kraken and the serpent-like Medusa grab the limelight over some of the old favorites from the Harryhausen version: Jason Flemyng's Calibos has less to do this time round while Pegasus simply conveniently appears when needed without needing to be tamed in a rather lazy bit of deux ex machina. But then this is the kind of film where the human cast are mostly sidelined as well, actors like Pete Posthlethwaite, Elizabeth McGovern, Danny Huston and Polly Walker turning up for a minute or two as little more than walk-ons and most of the gods having nothing more to do than stand around a disappointingly designed Olympus whose exteriors are spectacular but whose interiors look like Las Vegas car showroom. But it keeps moving without feeling too chopped up and thankfully there's a minimum of shakeycam or MTV overediting to accompany the overdose of testosterone. Big on spectacle and short on charm, it's a very different animal to Harryhausen's film (there's even an injoke about that version's irritating mechanical owl), but as long as you're expecting that it's one of the better action adventures of recent years.<br /><br />DVD buyers get short shrift yet again, with nearly all of the extras reserved for the BluRay release - 10 deleted scenes and alternate ending, 11 featurettes and additional picture-in-picture featurettes running throughout the film if you choose `Maximum Movie Mode' - which has a generally excellent transfer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE.html">A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE</a><br/><p>Greek mythology yields itself marvellously well to massive cinematic experiences. The wide shots include lots of very beautiful seashore, wilderness and forest scenes. These set the scenes wonderfully well for the adventure elements contained within this film. Also in this film, a lot of the creatures are presented, some friendly, and many that pose as formidable foes. A brave band of men set out on a journey to save the life of a princess after the foolish and arrogant boasts of a queen that was less than discrete.<br /><br />Included in this 'fellowship' is Perseus (Sam Worthington), the son of Zeus.<br /><br />The story is centered around the Greek city Argos. As the movie begins, there is a narration. We learn about the three main Olympians who battled in the distant past: the brothers Zeus (Liam Neeson), Poseidon (Danny Huston), and Hades (Ralph Fiennes). However, it was Hades who provided the means of defeating the Titans with his creation, the Kraken. After the Titans' defeat, Zeus created humans and ruled them, while Poseidon ruled the sea, but Hades, having been betrayed by Zeus, was forced to rule the Underworld. Zeus and Poseidon gain power from the prayers of humans, but Hades gets his power through fear.<br /><br />Humanity has gotten tired of the Olympians, and their self-serving ways and has started to rebel against them, this has led to Hades being given the authority to loose the Kraken upon humanity. (But Hades has not forgotten the betrayal of Zeus in the past.)<br /><br />This is a cinematic wonder with lots of very good CG animations that appear flawless. There is a lot of excitement and of particular focus was the encounter with Medusa - a lot of men were lost in this battle and it was simple awesome watching the men turn to stone.<br /><br />This story may have been told a thousand times, but so what? This one is still worth seeing. If you like adventure and action, rest assured that this movie delivers on the goods big time.</p></br><a href="../users/ARYSE5JQ3AG7L.html">ARYSE5JQ3AG7L</a><br/><p>I got this cheap, so I didn't mind watching a remake.<br /><br />After working all day in the cold, it was nice to watch a warm adventure about cold gods.<br /><br />Everybody got what they deserved.

This is a remake of the campy but cool 1981 version, and this one features way better special effects and acting and storytelling as bland and predictable as it comes. Sam Worthington (Terminator 4) stars as Perseus son of Zeus who is raised by a fishing family that is killed when Zeus statue is destroyed by an army defying the gods. Perseus is discovered by soldiers of Argos and after discovering he is Zeus' son is asked to take the task of defeating Hades and killing a creature known as "The Kraken". What follows is a series of battle scenes with various monsters that while impressive really don't have any reason to them, they just happen.<br /><br />Zeus (Liam Neeson, "Taken") wants his son to take his place as one of them, while Hades (Ralph Finnes "Red Dragon") wishes for the destruction of all man and wants to become the leader of the gods after being cast out by Zeus some time ago. There's also some race called the Djinn, which are neat looking conjourers that live in the desert that really are about the only cool characters in the whole movie.<br /><br />You get it all in this movie, giant scorpions, bad acting, a battle with Medusa, bad dialogue, the Kraken, and stale characters. Its a quick film, maybe 95 mins before the end credits start, but unfortunately all the thought and effort seemed to be put into the special effects. Again the acting, writing, stale characters really bring it down.</p></br><a href="../users/A28B7IJR80M8KE.html">A28B7IJR80M8KE</a><br/><p>I won't write a reveiew or sypnosis of this one...because there really isn't much of a story to write about....all I can say is most one star reviews here are right...this one is one big CGI movie with little or no substance....I say watch the 1981 original film if you want story & substance...yes, the effects might be a bit outdated by today's standards...but it is ten times better than this crappy remake!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>The only saving grace for this movie (and the only reason I didn't give it one star) is the special effects.

But storm clouds gather inexorably on the horizon; the Kingdom of Argos, infuriated by the cruel indifferences and vicissitudes of the Gods, has declared war on the omnipotent rulers of Mount Olympus themselves. Almighty Zeus (Liam Neeson), angered by the impudence of his creations, unleashes his banished brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) upon the face of the Earth in order to teach them a lesson. Perseus' family are amongst the first casualties of Hades' slaughter and, driven by inconsolable rage, he resolves to destroy the very ruler of the underworld himself...<br /><br />"Clash Of The Titans" is a splendid remake of a very silly but fun film. Because, let's be honest, as enjoyable as the original was, it was never a classic - not even at the time of it's release (which I remember very clearly). The original was a giant cheese football of a movie and this film is also a giant cheese football of a movie; the thing that they both have in common is that they're both completely enjoyable, largely because neither one takes itself very seriously at all.<br /><br />Like most of the best remakes, "Clash Of The Titans" reworks the concept of it's progenitor in order to go somewhere a little bit different. This film is a little darker than the original and, in a suitably Ouroborosian twist, has clearly been influenced by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NN7AKU">God of War: Collection</a> (an excellent PS2 game which was itself very clearly influenced by the original "Clash Of The Titans" - to the point that Harry Hamlin, the actor who played the original Perseus, voiced a character in "God Of War 2"). But while this film may favour a slightly darker tone, director Louis Leterrier  (who also made the fiendishly enjoyable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DHXT20">The Incredible Hulk (Widescreen Edition)</a> with Ed Norton) knows what made the original work and, CGI effects aside, keeps this film very much in the style of camp eighties fantasy movies like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000056WR3">Krull</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005Q4D7">The Beastmaster</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783241895">Conan the Barbarian - Collector's Edition</a> whilst throwing in some very subversive humour and the odd nod to the original (the brief cameo from Bubo, the rather naff clockwork Owl from the original, had me in fits of laughter, largely due to the way it was played).<br /><br />Personally, I think "Clash Of The Titans" stands head and shoulders over most of the bilge that has filled our cinemas lately. Sam Worthington makes a doggedly rugged Perseus; the rest of the cast (including Mads Mikkelsen, Liam Cunningham, Vincent Regan, Polly Walker and the gorgeous Gemma Arterton) all do a cracking job and clearly have fun doing it; Liam Neeson wanders around in a silly beard and armour; Ralph Fiennes throws in a combination impersonation of Terence Stamp in "Superman 2", Nicol Williamson in "Excalibur" and Richard Harris in "Gladiator" and the film as a whole is generally just a good, all-round, old-fashioned fantasy romp which doesn't take itself at all seriously and is over in under two hours.<br /><br />Frankly I really have no idea why this remake engendered so much hatred at the time of it's release and I genuinely don't know what's going on with audiences these days. They shower praise on simplistic, portentous drek such as "Avatar" like it's a rediscovered Tolstoy novel, yet they can't enjoy a good, old-fashioned fantasy flick which plays fast and loose with Greek mythology (in a deeply amusing manner) and which is merely the latest in a long line of films in which men in sandals and silly beards kick seven shades of what-the-horse-drops out of animated monsters.<br /><br />Myself personally, I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish and would love to see a sequel.<br /><br />Engage with it on the level on which it's intended and I suspect you'll have fun with it too.</p></br><a href="../users/A4UKBG3M5U5TI.html">A4UKBG3M5U5TI</a><br/><p>In ancient Greece, men have started to revolt against the gods, and the gods are not happy about this development.  After a massive statue of Zeus (Liam Neeson) is dumped into the ocean, Zeus' brother, Hades (Ralph Fiennes), takes vengeance on the perpetrators, killing a family of innocent bystanders.  The family includes the parents and sister of Perseus (Sam Worthington), who becomes our protagonist.  Hades (who feeds off the fear and hatred of mankind) convinces Zeus (who basks in the love of mankind) to teach the silly humans a lesson.  Zeus reluctantly agrees, and Hades begins a war upon the Kingdom of Argos.  Only Perseus can prevent the destruction of Argos and save mankind.<br /><br />"Clash of the Titans" is a bit silly at times, and like many movies of its ilk, it relies on an overly complicated back story that is related as a prologue.  It's easy to lose interest and get lost before the story even gets started.  However, the story here is not really that important when it comes right down to it.  That'd be the sword fights, battles, and special effects.  For an early summer popcorn movie, "Clash of the Titans" is above average.  In particular, the special effects are quite well done without being overly fussy, especially the horrific monster, Kracken.<br /><br />How does it compare to the original 1981 film on which it is based?  The 1981 version has become a bit of a camp classic, replete with horrible acting and even worse special effects.  However, it's also a rather fun movie (although I haven't seen it since I was a teenager).  I'd say that this new version is less fun but much better directed and acted.  Ralph Fiennes is actually quite good as Hades, even if his role consists mostly of appearing and then dissipating as a cloud of black smoke.  I also liked the character of Io (Gemma Arterton) - Perseus's benevolent protector.  Sam Worthington is not a particularly good action hero for me; he's a bit too bland and boring.  However, he can act rings around the original Perseus, Harry Hamlin.  I'd call the battle of the "Clashes" a draw.  I did miss the mechanical owl, Bubo (look fast for his cameo!), but many people will find his absence a blessing.  Incidentally, the movie was not available in 3-D in my area, so this review is for the 2-D version.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>"Clash of the Titans" is a truly amazing film -- never before have I seen a movie that is so BUSY, and yet so staggeringly DULL.<br /><br />This stupid movie was apparently made to cash in on the wild success of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QXDED6">300</a>, but it pretty much missed everything that made that movie enjoyable. Instead, this remake of the classic cult film is full of everything and nothing -- Louis Leterrier crams it with horrible acting, endless CGI, and an obnoxiously preachy plot that ends up being brain-bleedingly boring.<br /><br />A fisherman finds a floating coffin, which holds a dead princess and a still-living baby. He adopts the child, Perseus (Sam Worthington), and raises him as well -- until the god Hades (Ralph Fiennes) destroys Perseus' family and fishing boat. He's marched to the city of Argos, where he sees the king and queen declare war on the gods...<br /><br />... only to have Hades proclaim that if Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) is not sacrificed within ten days, the kraken will destroy Argos. A mysterious woman named Io  (Gemma Arterton) tells Perseus that he is actually the son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), and is the only hope of slaying the kraken and saving Argos.<br /><br />Honestly, the story of Perseus is one of the awesomest, most movieworthy stories in Greek mythology -- you've got a demigod hero, a sea monster, a flying horse, and a snake-headed creature that turns people to stone. But apparently, THAT story isn't good enough for the people in Hollywood. They even mock the original movie in one scene involving the mechanical owl Bubo.<br /><br />Instead director Leterrier crams all sorts of weird random stuff into the movie -- it's a constant onslaught of giant scorpions, CGI monsters, djinni, and witches who look like Guillermo del Toro discards. The plot feels skeletal and bloated at the same time, with horribly silly dialogue ("It is death who should be afraid of us!") and dozeworthy action scenes.<br /><br />Even worse, the screenwriters seem hell-bent on pushing their own theological philosophy on us ("God sucks and ruins everything, so don't worship him") NON-STOP. There's scene after scene of "We hate the gods! Gods are awful! Let's stupidly anger them even though they're incredibly powerful!"... only for them to undermine their own message in the last reel.<br /><br />And really, how can you go wrong when you have Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes in your movie, playing GODS? Well, you can cast the bland lump that is Sam Worthington as your lead, a pouting prettyboy who brings no charisma to his role, giving Neeson nothing to do except throw divine tantrums and Fiennes nothing to do except slink around being vaguely sinister (since a god of death HAS to be evil, right? WRONG!). As for Gemma Arterton, she just sort of wanders in and out of the story, serving as a source of convenient information.<br /><br />"Clash of the Titans" would be better titled "Flush of the Titans" -- a reeking lump of brainless cinema that stupefies even as it preaches. The original is flawed, but infinitely superior to this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A27P0MW8TE1JQP.html">A27P0MW8TE1JQP</a><br/><p>The 1981 Clash of the Titans was/still is a campy yet visually stunning fantasy classic. Campy? You ask? How could it not be, the Myths and archetypes by very definition are larger than life, so it stands to reason that the remake is going to have some camp to it, as well. And it does, but it doesn't disappoint as a popcorn picture, there the remake, like the original delivers. The original has the lovely Harry Hamlin, seriously,  Perseus is prettier than Princess of Argos  Andromeda. In the remake, up-and-comer Sam Worthington (Terminator 4, Avator) plays Perseus and has even less to do with the Princess than in the original, but he sure ain't no pretty-boy, and the new Andromeda is pretty, but Perseus is matched with the cursed and hauntingly attractive IO, this time round. Worthington's Perseus is even more of a reluctant hero than Hamlin, playing the everyman, a fisherman who has his great destiny thrust upon him. We get  more of a glimse of his back story this time, including the flashback to Zeus' seduction of Perseus' mother and another origin for Calibos tied to the bastard demi-god's birth (instead of the cursed son of goddess Thetis. Not from any real Greek myth, It has been said that Calibos was based on Caliban from "The Tempest" by William Shakespeare.)<br /><br /> The story is pretty similar to both the original and the myth; Perseus' re-gifted winged sandals still don't make it to the film's finale. The Mortals feeling as if they have been abandoned declare war on the gods,  Hades  leads the retaliation upon mankind in an attempt to seize power and usurp his brother Zeus. Perseus' adopted family is killed as Perseus swears vengeance Lord of the Underworld. Prideful Queen Cassiopeia again compares her daughter's beauty to that of the gods, to make amends Andromeda must be sacrificed or the whole city will be lost. Son of Zeus Perseus ends up on a quest to save Argos (and the lovely Andromeda ) from the punishment of the Kraken, collecting gifts and companions along the way, like some sword & sandals Magnificent Seven. Unlike the original, this film better captures the sense of scale between the gods and their strife with their less loyal subjects. It feels less like the Argons are the sole mortal effected. The bar for the gods is naturally raised, impressive transmutations and grand entrances and appearances, an homage to the clay figures of the original, only vaster.<br /><br />Although there are no Knights or Dames, the casting for the 2010 film is as impressively close to overkill as the original with egos such as Liam Neeson as Zeus (Olivier in '81), Ralph Fiennes a.k.a. Lord Voldemort is a perfect fit for Hades (omitted from the original). As I said Worthington replaces Harry Hamlin as Perseus, the lovely French actress Alexa Davalo as Andromeda (for Judi Bowker), Gemma Arterto( soon to be seen in Prince of Persia) plays  Io, who befriends Perseus in a much sexier way that Bergus Meridth's character. Luke Evans has a couple lines as the "prettier than Harry Hamlin"other son of Zeus, APOLLO ( ironicly enough Evans will BE playing Zeus in 2011's Dawn of War). A number of models are cast, well, to look pretty;  for example Russian supermodel Natalia Vodianova gets her turn as a much lovelier more sympatric Medusa than you would expect, and English beauty Agyness Deyn stands as little more than Olympus window-dressing as Aphrodite. Speaking of pretty, the movie was filmed mostly on location in the Canary Islands, and cinematography makes full use of the lush Greekish scenery .<br /><br />The Great Ray Harryhausen (Jason & the Argonauts), stop-motion genius behind all of the mythological critters of the '81 original initially questioned the need for a remake...but approved of the effects of this one. The homage to his brilliant serpent-bodied Medusa is apparent, as is the return of the the giant scorpions, the Pegasus, Calibos and not to mention the over-the-top sea-monstery goodness of the Kraken for the climax. Speaking of homages, Bebo cameo at the half-hour mark. One new addition the Djinn, desert  mages who extend their immortally by replace their flesh with  "charwood and black magic," appearing  as nightmarish treelike Middle-Earth figures  with glowing blue eyes and wicked teeth. The visuals are pleasing, but the movie was retrofitted with the 3-D effect, so it has it's moments, but isn't super, but the directing style of Louis Leterrier (Hulk) lends itself to the techniques used for the process.<br /><br />Best not to think of this as a re-make, but a Spring Break distraction, for which it serves it's purpose...<br />I expect the Kraken will soon topple the Dragons & their trainers from the box office weeklys.</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes<br />star in this 2010 fantasy remake of the 1981 film.<br />A young man goes on a quest to defeat an evil<br />God and battles mythic monsters.

I recommend this.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>First let me say that I am rarely one to complain about an old movie, even a classic movie, getting a modern day makeover. I see negative reviews of remakes based alone on the feeling that some movies are sacred and should never be messed with. I say if you can take a classic and make it even better, then by all means have at it. This 2010 version of Clash of the Titans fails at making the 1981 version better and maybe was worth looking at only because of its cool CGI effects.<br /><br />I'd have been completely satisfied if fledgling Director Louis Leterrier took the 1981 original story word for word and simply re-did it with updated FX. While he did indeed pay homage to the 1981 version in many respects, it seems he got lost more in creating cool looking FX and abandoning the perfect story flow that the original had. Adding certain aspects to the story could have been interesting if it all made sense, but for me it just didn't make sense and seemed to jump all over the place.<br /><br />And then there was the acting, or should I say lack thereof. It didn't seem to me that Sam Worthington who played Perseus or Liam Neeson who played Zeus took their roles seriously at all. They came across as two A-listers making cameos versus lead actors giving A-list performances. This combined with the uneven storytelling really took a lot out of the movie for me.<br /><br />I was never even a fan of Greek Mythology until seeing the original Clash back in the 80s. After that movie I not only became interested in Greek Mythology, I felt I now actually knew something about it...like I just had a very clear and concise lesson in it. After the 2010 Clash, I felt the same way I did after the recent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NTPDT6">Transformers</a>...like I'd just seen a lot of cool FX with little substance to the story.<br /><br />So my recommendation is to pick up the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q7ZOL2">the 1981 original version</a> and pass on this 2010 version until it comes out on cable. As dated as Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion effects will look in the 1981 version, you'll walk away from it with a much more entertaining and even educating experience. And if you're just looking for some mythological fun I'd say get yourself a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0J4VQ">PlayStation 3</a> and spend countless hours with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NN7AKU">God of War Collection</a>.</p></br></body></html>

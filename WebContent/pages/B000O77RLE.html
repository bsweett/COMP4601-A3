I am not the biggest fan of Clint Eastwood, even as a director but can't deny he has talent.  This film is one I loved and will remember forever.  I am amazed that he was so willing to make the film in Japanese and worked so hard to make it as authentic as possible.  While Flags of Our Fathers comes out as too distant or false, this film comes with great feeling and insight.  It well deserved a nomination for Best Picture and probably should have won it.  I really appreciated this filma and highly recommend others to see it too.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>The second installment of Clint Eastwood's epic Pacific Theatre movies, `Letters from Iwo Jima' is just as grand as `Flags of Our Fathers,' but the understated scenes create a more poignant atmosphere that resonates more powerfully throughout the whole movie.  No where does the movie try to take sides.  I didn't watch this movie telling myself, `I didn't know the Americans were so savage.'  That's not really the point.  Eastwood and screenwriter take the position of individual Japanese participants without any thought of the Axis.  What they do is show how war sweeps up decent, ordinary people in its bloody grips.  There are corresponding battle scenes that work well in both movies.  This time we see it from the Japanese angle.  The graphic battle scenes surely don't hide the brutal affair that war truly becomes.<br /><br />The point-of-view is from a sympathetic Japanese soldier, Capt. Kirbashi (Ken Wanabe), who has visited America during a time that both sides couldn't conceive of war between the two countries.  He has pleasant encounters, but a telling scene shows comraderie with an American soldier who honors him in the States.  He indicates that a true soldier puts his country first.  However, later even he will offer a dying American soldier a nearly deplete portion of morphine.  (How much of a measure was that the usual course, I doubt, from either side.)  Another focus is for two young soldiers.  They, like many of their peers, believe their fate is marked on the island.  Their commander, Lt. Ito, is a nasty superior who always browbeats and actually once beats one with a cane for showing, allegedly, a lack of patriotism.  He is the arm of most Japanese sentiment.  Being men of honor, they are willing to commit suicide, rather than face dishonor.  One of them was discharged earlier for not having shot a dog on order.  We see how the Japanese operations work as government officials break up a reluctant young Japanese couple with a newborn.  "Congratulations!" the woman official exclaims.  It is a nice reminder of how people are often at mercy in the world of their own governments and circumstances beyond their control.<br /><br />I asked myself, considering myself a patriotic American, why I liked  `Letters from Iwo Jima' better than `Flags of Our Fathers'.  I believe, although excellent, 'Flags of Our Fathers' doesn't try to get bogged down with some trivia pursuit it took with the participants in the photo flag-raising.  'Letters from Iwo Jima' sees all of us as potential victims falling into the vortex of war, even on a bloody, desolate rock island in the middle of the Pacific.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>To most Eastwoods 'Flags of our Fathers' wasn't that great in telling the story of those soldiers who raised the flag on Iwo Jima. I personally loved that film and was delighted to see that Eastwood had done what rarely is, and told the other side to that story from the perspective of the Japanese army. Iwo Jima takes a very similar approach to telling the story of the main soldiers by zooming back and forth from past to present, explaining how the soldiers got to where they where and what they've left at home. I can certainly see the difference between this and 'Flags' and I would certainly rate this as the better, yet would not be willing to shut down 'Flags' in a hurry.<br /><br />Iwo Jima gives what seems to be an open view on the side of the Japanese and touches upon the Honour principle as to how the soldiers fought without cowardice or retreated with dishonour. This is a strong film when touching upon the Honour principle that the Japanese live by. It even touches upon the fact that some soldiers were actually killed if they displayed any sort of cowardly behaviour and would sooner kill themselves than surrender. It's an emotional experience to watch these Japanese soldiers who don't really want to fight, but are forced into it for fear of being executed as traitors if they refuse.<br /><br />The island of Iwo Jima is the last part preventing the USA from taking Japanese mainland. Because of this the Japanese are desperate that American soldiers don't take the island, so the Japanese Imperial Army employ General Kuribayashi to develop a strategy that would defeat the American army. However, the general does not approve of the rigid traditional approach by some of his sub-ordinates. He also begins to resent the resistance from the sub-ordinates to follow his new commands and new ideas which he hopes would help defend the Island. In the lower ranks is a young soldier Saigo who, in his home life is a small town baker now forced with the struggle to overcome the inevitability of his death along with his fellow soldiers.<br /><br />Eastwood has a way of making films that is unmatched by any other film maker today. He's shockingly brilliant and although I'm not crazy over his acting, his directing is truly superb. He manages to blend large scale CGI with blood and guts and the truly emotional story together perfectly to give the viewer one hell of a movie going experience. If you're not a fan of foreign films then this may not be your kind of film due to it being entirely in Japanese. The acting of Ken Watanabe and Kazunari Ninomiya is just second to none, and will hopefully introduce the greatness that foreign films even if directed by Americans, can be truly superb without the recognition an English speaking film would gain.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend this film to anyone put off by the fact that it's Japanese speaking. There are subtitles to aid you in following the story, but it's still something to experience even if you have trouble following the subtitles.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood deserves huge kudos for tackling the 'other side' of a big war movie, and so close to 'Flags of Our Fathers', which I also enjoyed immensely.  The Japanese actors are excellent and the dialogue was snappy and original, though I had to re-wind a couple times because my eyes couldn't keep up with the subtitles.  I tend to go 'cross-eyed' if it's fast.  I especially love the baker character who didn't really want to be there and left a young, pregnant wife at home.  The movie was excellent in showing how many get caught up in a war they don't necessarily believe in.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>To be honest, I was enthused to see Letters but not completely excited. I thought its companion Flags of Our Fathers was a dramatically empty war film that seemed manipulative as it was banal. Everyone was saying how great Letters From Iwo Jima was and while I knew it had to be better than Flags, I was curious as to the extent on how better it was. I sometimes find Clint Eastwood films (aside from Unforgiven) to be a little too emotionally distant and a bit too calculated. While a couple of points knock Letters down from being a classic war film, it's still better than anything since Saving Private Ryan.<br /><br />Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai, Batman Begins) plays Koribayashi, a General stationed on island Iwo Jima during World War II. American forces are quickly approaching the island in hopes of taking it over and it doesn't help that the Japanese forces on the island are quite outnumbered and lack of support from the mainland makes things worse. Saigo is a young soldier who's not as battle-hardened and like many of the soldiers, he wants to get back to his wife and baby. But when 2 governments say war must go on, how do you end up stopping something you don't even want to be in in the first place?<br /><br />I have to get the negative out of the way. The film has a slight sluggish pace to it. Even though we get scenes of character development as well as war scenes, the whole vibe feels a little bit more serious and maybe not as accessible. Ever watch a movie that just feels long? That's kind of what this felt like. Even though longer movies like Saving Private Ryan or Apocalypse Now were lengthy, they never once felt their length whereas this film you get the feeling the world slowed down a tad. Granted, it is a war film and it's not meant to be some popcorn fun, when you consider films about war being better paced, you kind of notice it here.<br /><br />One problem I always have with Paul Haggis scripts (Million Dollar Baby, Flags and notably Crash) is just how fleshed out the characters feel. His and other scripts by other writers have what I call "plot puppets": characters that don't really live and breathe that we care for but rather just tools to say dialogue and deliver dramatic scenes without the emotional backing to support it. Letters corrects that very problem Flags suffered from and we feel a lot more for these soldiers this time. Maybe it was that film's more recognizable cast or maybe here they just feel more complex than the other film.<br /><br />Even though it's about an entirely different conflict, it's hard not to compare Letters to Spielberg's Private Ryan, what with the color desaturation but you can make a case that this is probably one of the better crafted war films lately.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>Letters from Iwo Jima is an extraordinary film.  Despite its depiction of war, it is a much quieter, serene, and moving film than its sister film,  Flags of Our Fathers.  It does touch on how soldiers are pawns in politicans' schemes like Flags, but this film concentrates almost exclusively on the Japanese soldiers themselves, most of whom died defending the island.  Ken Watanabe gives a towering performance as the commander of the island, a vastly intelligent, articulate, caring man, who nevertheless does what he feels is his duty to his country, knowing very well that he will most likely be killed.  Like Flags, we really get to know these soldiers like we were in the platoon ourselves, and aside from a few war speeches, Letters and Flags never feel like they are propaganda, gun-ho garbage that Hollywood and others have been known for putting out.  Clint's direction is breathtakingly assured.  When you take into account that Clint speaks no Japanese, and he directs a film almost exclusively in Japanese, it makes the film even more extraordinary to behold.  There has only been a few films in history that have managed to do this, a film where a foreign director immerses himself so much in the culture that if you didn't know it was a foreign director directing the film, you'd swear it was a native of the country (Kurosawa's Dersu Uzala, Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, and Tarkovsky's The Sacrifice are examples of this phenomenon).<br /><br />Perhaps the best example of Clint's direction is in the following scene. One of the Japanese soldiers arrives at the island, and the other soldiers believe him to be a spy sent by the officers.  He eventually tells them his story, and why he was sent to Iwo Jima.  He was enforcing curfew in a local town with one of his officers, and they pass by one of the houses where a dog is barking rather loudly.  The officer informs the soldier to take the dog inside the house, and shoot it.  The soldier takes the dog into the house, and the family is horrified.  The soldier shoots a bullet in the air, and tells the family to keep the dog quiet. The soldier then leaves the house, but the dog barks again. The officer becomes furious, and he goes into the house to shoot the dog. But you never see the dog being shot, you only hear the shot, and see the soldier's reaction (only the officer goes into the house).  This makes the scene so powerful and sad. The soldier was sent to Iwo Jima because he let the dog live, and the officer was furious that the soldier disobeyed him.  The way Clint films this scene is why it's so memorable.  A lesser director would have shown the dog getting shot, with hand held shots and hysterical screaming. He would have tried to justify his decision by saying "it's more realistic", which it is, but there is no art, poetry, or intelligence in that. It's lame shock value, which will always lessen the dramatic impact of a scene.<br /><br />The lessons of war are so vivid here and in Flags.  Almost none of the Japanese soldiers made it back from Iwo Jima, and the American ones who did got exploited by the media and the government.  When they were done with them, they were forgotten about.  Both films are very sad, but they are necessary viewing.  There are moments of pure poetry in both films.  Letters has more though.  There is a deep sadness to this film especially, and it's darkened cinematography really enhances it.  This is one of Eastwood's greatest films, and one of the best war films ever made...</p></br><a href="../users/A1NLZVP501JM5Z.html">A1NLZVP501JM5Z</a><br/><p>Well.  Don't go into this movie expecting to be entertained, its more of an experience than anything else.  Of course Letters From Iwo Jima is about the battle of Iwo Jima told from the Japanese perspective with English Subtitles.  I didn't see Flags of Our Fathers so I can't compare the two.<br /><br />The acting is very good, Ken Watanabe is as good as ever and the guy that plays "Shago" was great.  The direction is good, I was hoping for more battle scenes on Iwo Jima but I heard Flags has more fighting.  This movie moves slowly at first but once we come(Americans) it all pretty much goes to hell for everyone.<br /><br />I loved the sepia toned, drained look to the movie and the ending is great in my opinion.  The only part where this movie drags is in the beginning, but thats a minor complaint.  It also has one of the most disheartening scenes I've ever scene.  I guess I gotta put up the big SPOILER! warning to talk about it, so SPOILERS!<br /><br />Its the scene where the roomful of Japanese soldiers blow themselves up with there own gren@des.  Now that we are talking about v!olence lets talk about how bad it is in this movie.  Honestly, its not that bad.  Yes, there are some graphic scenes, but if your kid has seen GLADIATOR OR Kingdom of Heaven or another war movie he/she should see this.<br /><br />Overall this is a heart wrenching, great look at how bad war is.  And that no matter what side you are on there are good and bad people.  Probably most importantly it says that in war there are no winners, only losers...</p></br><a href="../users/A2809U2S14N0K1.html">A2809U2S14N0K1</a><br/><p>From the American side, the battle always seen as dangerous but the average US soldier thought that he was going to live though it. From the Japanese soldiers view, they were dead man. They did not expect to survive. Still they fought to the end.<br /><br />The film explains the battle well as is the strategic position that Japanese faced. I though the acting was reasonable although not brilliant. The characters well developed. I think the acting let it down a bit.<br /><br />The filming is good.<br /><br />It shows that Japanese troops with as the write up said with strength, honour and courage. Still it is a shame in his earlier movie "Flags of our Fathers" Clint Eastwood did not use his talent to show the American troops going though similar suffering in that battle with these virtues too.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>Of the 2 war films that Clint Eastwood directed, "Flags of our Fathers" and "Letters from Iwo Jima", the latter film can qualify as Clint's masterpiece. With restraint and sensitivity, Eastwood has shown us how really futile war is and the sacrifices of the ordinary foot soldier, whether they be Japanese or American.  In some quarters, many critics felt Clint should've taken Best Picture and Best Director but the Academy did finally give an long over-due Oscar to Martin Scorsese for "The Departed".  But who's to say which is the better--like apples and oranges, these 2 films achieved their goals brilliantly. But getting back to "Letters", special mention should be given to the performances here given by Ken Watanabe as the commander and Kazunari Ninomiya as cook turned soldier. Their performances lend a special poignancy to this film as well as the other performers in this film.  The battle scenes are just as powerful as those in "Saving Private Ryan" though one should remember that Spielberg was one of the producer of this film as well.  In HD DVD, these scenes are brilliantly delinerated.  Highly recommeded.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MQQI4UYT9C11.html">A2MQQI4UYT9C11</a><br/><p>"Letters from Iwo Jima" is the second and less publicized half (along with "Flags of our Fathers") of Clint Eastwood's pair of movies about the battle for Iwo Jima near the end of World War II. Based on some actual letters from the Japanese commander on the island to his family in Tokyo, the film tells the story of the American invasion from the perspective of the Japanese troops dug in to protect part of their homeland (politically, Iwo Jima, though an almost uninhabitable rock located hundreds of miles from the mother islands, was part of the Tokyo district of Japan). The Japanese soldiers were put in the unenviable predicament of serving as a stalling tactic. Japanese high command never supported them with the intent of defeating the American invaders, just slowing them down and causing a lot of casualties, hopefully enough to cause the Americans to sue for peace. On the other side, the Americans needed the island badly as a refueling point for bombers tasked to attack the Japanese mainland.<br /><br />With a cast of actors largely unknown to American audiences (though star Ken Watanabe was in "Memoirs of a Geisha"), Eastwood can focus your attention on the relationship between the commander and his men and of both to their hopeless mission. To me, Eastwood's (and the commander's) message is loud and clear to political leaders--be very careful about starting a war because wars are so difficult, painful and costly to end. Soldiers who are sent into battle to do nothing but kill and die have families and loved ones at home. Every casualty is a personal tragedy that ultimately may be not be justified by the war's outcome. Kudos to Eastwood for making the film. "Letters from Iwo Jima" is not light entertainment. Five stars for fans of serious and thought-provoking cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>Before I saw Letters from Iwo Jima, I had every expectation that I'd find it a great film, and much to my surprise, I did not. Oh, let me assure anyone who might stumble across this humbly submitted review that Letters from Iwo Jima is a good movie, but it doesn't merit the term "great" in the way that recent World War Two productions such as Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, and HBO's Band of Brothers all do, and this revelation caught me off guard. Even amid the orgies of death and wasted self-sacrifice in Clint Eastwood's tale from the Japanese side of the front, we have a sort of cinematic version of World War Two-lite which has much in common with 2001's Enemies At The Gate, another genre film that aimed for something outside its grasp. To single out Letters' worst flaw I would say it felt rushed, and it lacked those on-screen qualities I can only term heart and soul.<br /><br />The fact is Letters from Iwo Jima felt incomplete. It also seemed hollow. Whereas the real life battle of Iwo Jima involved many thousands of combatants on both sides, never when seeing this film did I ever witness more than a perhaps a score of Japanese soldiers grouped together, and even what could have been the immensity of the American landing on the shores of this mortally-contested protrusion of earth was underwhelming and hurried through. I felt I was seeing less an epic than an intimate project involving a miniscule company of players in an almost theatrical setting. I also felt let-down that the director ended the motion picture as he did, rapidly, abruptly, without meaningful closure. One more scene, even, of the featured Japanese survivor returning home to his wife and child would have added much depth to the climax of what was often simultaneously deep and shallow storytelling. Pacing was problematic all during this story, and nevermore than at its conclusion. Having anticipated much, I felt disappointed.<br /><br />There were strong performances in Letters and there were a few memorable moments, but as I've twice pointed out, despite a long running time everything felt forced and impelled toward brevity. The scenes of General Tadamichi Kuribayashi's time spent among Americans in happier pre-war days were frustratingly brief and inexplicably under-explored. There were more things wrong with Letters from Iwo Jima than there were right, and that's not how it was supposed to be: not in a movie this acclaimed and with this much inter-continental talent involved.<br /><br />I'll rate this much-discussed movie as four stars, but I almost felt it was closer to three.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>WARNING: Spoilers Ahead!<br /><br />- The special effects of the deaths in the battle field are vividly real.<br /><br />- There are many scenes dealing with human psychology. They made me feel unsettled, and deeply touched. They also showed that the enemies were not always inhumane. For example, in one scene, a Japanese officer ordered his doctor to help a U.S. prisoner. In another scene, some U.S. killed 2 Japanese who surrendered to revenge their buddies' death.<br /><br />- There are many extremely disturbing scenes depicting the fanatic of many Japanese officers and soldiers who prefer suicide to surrendering. In another scene, a soldier lying to his officer about shooting a barking dog and was savagely beaten.<br /><br />- It got an Oscar in 2007 for Best Achievement in Sound Editing,<br /><br />- In short, this is one of the BEST that MY MONEY CAN GET in terms of war movies with characters' depth</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>Like lots of America kids, I was raised on heroic tales of America's history in World War II. Its images, among them the iconic flag-raising at Iwo Jima, were forever seared into my imagination. Not to mention that I happened to grow up in the town that lays claim to Rene Gagnon, one of the flag-raisers!<br /><br />I don't think it ever occurred to me that there was another side to the story, that of the faceless enemy that hid in caves and bunkers, lying in wait to slaughter our brave boys.<br /><br />"Letters from Iwo Jima" is director Client Eastwood's attempt to humanize the Japanese and show the fight from their side. The story focuses on General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) sho is unusual or a Japanese military man - he carefully plans the battle, with a clear-eyed assessment of the strengths and tactics of his enemy. That puts him at odds with many of his colleagues, who have no respect for the Americans as warriors and presume an easy victory over them. The rank and file are represented by Private First Class Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya), a family man and simple baker placed in the crosshairs of history. Saigo's open and expressive face makes him the perfect antithesis to the dehumanized and faceless "Jap" that many of us grew up on. The film takes us from the preparations for the battle, the landing itself, the relentless pounding that the Japanese took rom air and sea and the desperate life living in tunnels clawed from the volcanic rock.<br /><br />If anything, the film swings perhaps a bit too far toward defanging the Japanese. They are portrayed as poor grunts riven to work by a few obsessively crazed superiors. They empathize with wounded Americans. General Kuribayashi is often shown writing sad letters home to his family. Except for a few madly patriotic soldiers, most of the island's defenders just seem ready to go home. I hate to spoil the party, but Iwo's garrison had dug 11 miles of tunnels into rock. Perhaps not all were political fanatics, but it seems to me that it would take more than a half-hearted attempt to accomplish that feat!<br /><br />Nonetheless, "Letters from Iwo Jim" is a success, and gives a small taste of what the battle might have looked like from the other end of US Marine and Navy guns. A worthy companions to "Flags of Our Fathers," Eastwood's companion piece from the American point of view.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LXKO2S6G2DBI.html">A3LXKO2S6G2DBI</a><br/><p>I like a good war movie, and by this, I mean gung-ho, yee-ha shoot 'em ups that supplant the grim reality of war with the action and intensity of simple, if violent, competition.  Characters suffer in these movies, but never to the degree of reality, with the good guys easy to distinguish from the bad, and even when based on real events, they are generally more fantasy than reality.  (Having a father who was a Vietnam era soldier and a mother who witnessed as a child the death of innocents in the Korean War can clarify the difference.)<br /><br />Among the better war movies are "Zulu," "The Guns of Navarone," "Where Eagles Dare," and "Pork Chop Hill."  Every once in a while, though, I sneak in a movie about war.  They're not the same thing.  These kinds of films supplant grim reality for action and intensity.  Sometimes they are anti-war, showing the tragic futility of combat to settle differences.  Stanley Kubrick's brilliant "Paths of Glory" comes to mind, as does Terrance Malick's "The Thin Red Line."  Sometimes they are anti-soldier, depicting the utter barbarity of human beings when left to their own to act out on sadism, racism, or ethnocentrism.  These are easier to find in foreign markets than the U.S., where jingoism is so integral a part of culture, but "The Last Valley" and "Casualties of War" qualify.<br /><br />It's easy to blame soldiers -- after all, if they weren't so eager to fight, maybe there wouldn't be war.  But until someone improves upon the human condition for too many people, that just seems terribly naive.  Still, Hollywood has a habit of wanting to make an anti-war statement once or twice a decade, and the tone generally comes off as anti-soldier.  Not "Letters from Iwo Jima," a rather remarkably nuanced film in this regard, made more so because it tells its story from the point of view of the Japanese rather than the Americans.  Having grown up seeing the Japanese painted as one-dimensional villains in war movies -- and knowing full well the brutality Japanese soldiers inflicted on my mother's native country of Korea -- I wasn't expecting an American film to move me so easily in its creation of three-dimensional characters.  These Japanese soldiers are real human beings, some noble, some cruel, but all like people you actually know rather than the cardboard cutouts of most war movies.  Ken Watanabe, at times doing a poor man's Toshiro Mifune, is nonetheless decidedly charismatic in his portraly of General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, the commander of the doomed contingent of Imperial defenders, but Kazunari Ninomiya, as Private Saigo, carries most of the dramatic weight as a cynical teenager coming to terms with the futility of his position.  The rest of the cast is equally effective, and Clint Eastwood's direction shows him to be one of the premier American filmmakers of our time.<br /><br />Many people know the historical results of the Battle of Iwo Jima but mostly from the point of view of the Americans, who fought bravely and determinedly and suffered tremendous casualties.  But of lesser concern was that of the Japanese.  This film, sure to irk some audiences, stresses the latter, though not to the degree of showing one side as better or worse.  Instead, the film correctly focuses on the soldiers rather than the battle, and in this, despite the sometimes cruel actions of men on both sides, it becomes a pro-soldier film even if still resonating as anti-war.  I don't know if I can watch it more than once, but I'm glad I did watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/AVT9Q9PTUCDMR.html">AVT9Q9PTUCDMR</a><br/><p>Whereas Flags Of Our Fathers falls flat, Letters From Iwo Jima rises to become certainly a front-runner as one of the best war films ever. The main reason this movie works so well is the acting which is beyond first-rate and the way the characters are drawn in a fantastic script. There are some "holy ____!" moments especially one suicide scene and a "flame-on" of a soldier in another. The way the movie was shot also helps evokes the barrenness of the real Iwo Jima and the way the island was turned into scorched earth.<br /><br />The extras are worthy of Oscar consideration as beyond the ubiquitous "making of" is a look at how they cast the film with the various Japanese actors' backgrounds and how they were chosen for their roles revealed. There is also thrown in the Japanese premiere and press conference which was a nice bonus touch (why don't more DVDs put those on their extras).<br /><br />If you understand Japanese (the movie is subtitled in English), they have tried to accurately recreate the way the Japanese language was spoken and used back in 1945 but early on you'll hear one soldier refer to Americans as "American" rather than "America-jin." That was sort of odd.<br /><br />Also, as a huge cultural insight into the Japanese psyche back then and comparing it to the way it is now will be endlessly fascinating to any person who has spent any length of time in Japan. I'll leave that at that otherwise I'm apt to go off on some social anthropological rant.<br /><br />Anyway, on so many levels this movie works whether you're a fan of war movies or not.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198O25QYUPXE.html">A2198O25QYUPXE</a><br/><p>"Letters from Iwo Jima" is a film that provides a Japanese perspective regarding the WWII island battle, and works in partnership with "Flags of Our Fathers".

Henning - Australian Author</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>War is hell,of hat there is no doubt.We tend to malign our enemies maliciously during times of crisis/war.In this instance the Japanese were portrayed as small,bespectacled dirty fighters often referred to as Nips or Japs.The truth was the Japanese were indeed hard soldiers to contend with on the battlefield,stopping at very little to win the tiniest piece of ground,even to the extent of banzai or suicide charges(on the ground-kamikazes in the air).But to propagandize the public and sheer up support for the war machine(very necessary in times such as WW2)these kind of images helped to propel the US and the rest of the allies ever onward to ultimate victory.<br />Underneath the Japanese soldier lay....a human being like anyone else.Their Samurai code and service and discipline structures gave them an attitude which took the Western powers a while to get a handle on.When they finally did they took the fighting to the Japanese in their own style.30,40 years ago,this movie would not have stood much of a chance of getting noticed or being accepted altogether.Memories of those that fought against them were still very much tender.Even today it is still tough for those that fought in such hell holes as Iwo Jima,to accept another or different side to that piece of battlefield history.It was a bold step on Eastwood's part to undertake its making,but undertake it he did and to much acclaim.<br />Letters from Iwo Jima(released in Dec/06) was the second release which dealt with that terrible battle.His first epic was Flags of our Fathers(told from the U.S. perspective),but personally I find this one much more compelling than the first.The story in "Letters" dealt with the small(in comparison)Japanese garrison ordered to hold the island at all costs.We see the day to day life amongst the troops and their struggle to survive on little hope,meager rations and a strict and unbending command structure.In fact what makes this movie work so well is the pall of the little hope this garrison has against the superior forces of the Americans.It is truly a miracle they accomplished and held out as much they did,as long as they did.We see the human but tragic side of the Japanese,a side we the Japanese antagonists have more often than not,just refused to see.Again it is a rational thought process as we,especially the soldiers themselves,would like to try and forget all the horrors that battle,as so many others of WW2,bring to mind.Many others would also say they got as good as good as they gave.Of that I cannot argue.<br />This movie stirs up those and a plethora of other emotions as you watch it,but Eastwood's camera doesn't dwell on any one thing too long.The movie does not take a side,it projects what it was like to be a Japanese soldier during the battle for Iwo Jima,and nothing more.Eastwood,remarkably and successfully,juggles a very controversial topic masterfully.If it had been handled any other way it would have been a disaster.<br />This two disc edition has been transferred beautifully and is clear and crisp in its original widescreen a/r.Extras are abundant and include:A featurette on the making of the movie,a look at the cast members and a clip from the 2006 premiere and press conference in Japan for the movie.<br />A highly recommended DVD for war buffs out there and for everyone else looking for good plain entertainment.The movie takes no sides and Eastwood and company gives a surprisingly accurate portrayal of the life of the Japanese soldier during one of the most bloodiest battles of the Pacific during WW2.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>From the moment I started this film, I was completely enthralled at the contrast between the normal men and the brutal military code that drove them during this hopeless battle.  Regarding the men, there are absolutely wonderful characters.  You have the fictional baker, a seemingly weak man whom the viewer believes will probably survive, who makes friends with a supposed Kempetai he could not trust; the fanatical sub-commanders who sometimes force their men to suicide; the general Kuribayashi, who saw further than his colleagues and had a wider vision of the world yet persisted in his duty to the end.<br /><br />The most important thing for me was that I empathized so much with all of these men.  It may sound strange, but I lived in Japan and came away with an extremely negative view of its society, which enabled me over the last 20 years to take some pretty rigid stances about it.  In particular, I have felt so disgusted at the brutality of their behavior in China, which the Ministry of Education officially covers over (to this day portraying the Japanese as victims of the war), that I felt we were justified in the way we attacked them in the war and to make some blanket generalizations.  This film has gotten me to question my lack of sympathy for the Japanese who fought, even the misguided fanatics who killed their own men for nothing.  Yes, the Bushido code was twisted to the designs of a militaristic regime, but until now I have wondered how human their soldiers were.  This is the gift that only great art can bestow.<br /><br />REcommended with enthusiasm.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Decoration Day or Memorial Day as it is now called is a day set aside to honor those who fought in all of the wars since the Civil War, wars in defense of country and citizens. While we languish over the misbegotten war on Iraq it is helpful to view the Clint Eastwood film LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA and visit the mindset of the 'enemy' - the soldiers pointing weapons our way - in an attempt to understand the global effect of war on the battlefield.<br /><br />Eastwood wisely pairs his disappointing 'Flags of our Fathers', which addressed the political 'war games' simultaneously with the combat on a small Japanese island in World War II, with a 'look at the other side' viewpoint. The same type of militarism, blind faith in the war machine, brutality, fear of dying, bonding among friends, the spectrum of 'good officers versus cruel inflexible officers, and the spectrum of humanity is equalized and the result is a moving drama that sheds needed light on how 'war' is a universal beast no matter one's stance.<br /><br />The telling of the story with occasional letter contents is sound if somewhat over long. The screenplay by Iris Yamashita and Paul Haggis is based on Tadamichi Kuribayashi's "Picture Letters from Commander in Chief" - Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) being the film's chief character. Watanabe is excellent in his well-rounded approach to the role of the 'good commander' in both his wise military judgment and his kindness bestowed on the simplest of soldiers such as Saigo (the sensitive Kazunari Ninomiya). For many of us this is the first encounter with the vantage that the Japanese were minimally supplied and supported in defending their sacred Iwo Jima against the American aggressors: the battle was a doomed last stand for the Japanese despite all the casualties suffered by both sides. Eastwood does away with the 'kamikaze' stereotype of the Japanese soldier and allows us to see them as human beings, away form home, fighting to defend their country and their honor.<br /><br />No one is right in war: circumstances and places vary from Europe, the Far East, the Middle East and here but horrors remain the same. It is good to be reminded of this, as in LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA, especially on Memorial Day. Grady Harp, May 07</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This is really a terrific film.  I think it is much superior to Flags of Our Fathers.  You get a very human side to the other side in this famous WWII battle.  The Japanese basically know the war is lost, but they still have their honor and want to protect their homeland.  The best way to do that is to deny the American's this island to use as a base to launch attacks on the Japanese homeland.  To the last man they intent to fight until the end.  Really incredible characterization which shows you the generals all the way down to the peasant soldier digging trenches.  The movie is mostly in Japanese, but don't let that scare you.  I am not a big foreign film fan, but I found the subtitles not distracting at all.  The acting is so strong, you could probably just watch it without the subtitles and still be able to follow the flow of the story.  The acting is that strong.  This is a must for any war film fan and any fan of a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>This is the only war film Clint Eastwood should have released, though I think this film helps make the lackluster Flags of Our Fathers a little better. The acting is very good, especially the great Ken Wantanabe as the general in charge of defending this doomed island. I wouldn't go as far to say that it is a great film, but it deserves a spot on my top ten war films ever made list.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CZPM110DW516.html">A2CZPM110DW516</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood's companion piece to "Flags of Our Fathers" may be the director's finest work to date. In telling the story of the battle of Iwo Jima from the point of view of the Japanese, Eastwood is sympathetic to the soldiers whose attempt to defend the island is doomed, but with the exception of one scene, does so without vilifying the American troops who succeeded where the Japanese failed.<br /><br />The film succeeds by personalizing the war for the men who fought it. Whatever one thinks of their cause, these men are motivated by the same patriotic forces as the Americans, and are simply doing what they believe is just. After all, wars are planned and manipulated by men who never set foot on the battlefield. Even the most heroic soldiers, regardless of the country from which they hail, fight in service to interests that benefit the business community more than their country.<br /><br />Eastwood's one false and manipulative move is a scene in which two Japanese deserters are cold-bloodly gunned down by Americans. This is in stark contrast to an earlier moment when an American held hostage by the opposition is treated respectfully by his captors. The latter scene is an admirable attempt to humanize the enemy but is unnecessary since the film has already successfully countered the smirking and monstrous stereotypes of the Japanese that were promoted by Hollywood during and shortly after World War II. The barbarism we witness from the Americans, however, whether accurate or not, seems like sop meant to appeal to the anti-American sentiments expressed as a result of our invasion of Iraq.<br /><br />Technically, "Letters from Iwo Jima" is faultless. Tom Stern's cinematography is appropriately murky, and the imagery striking. The performances are all superb, especially from Ken Watanabe as General Kuribayashi, Kazunari Nonomiya as Saigo, and Tsuyoshi Ihara as Baron Nishi. The screenplay by Iris Yamahita and Paul Haggis is compact, and nicely interweaves scenes of the men's earlier civilian life with their dreary existence awaiting certain death. The music score by Kyle Eastwood and Michael Stevens is haunting and subtle<br /><br />The extras are a little skimpy but include some interesting behind-the-scenes information, some footage from the premiere at Budokan, and a press conference featuring Eastwood and his exceptional cast. The latter provides an opportunity to learn more about players who, with the exception of Watanabe, are unknown in the U.S.<br /><br />Brian W.

So what if this film "shows soldiers unfairly killing captives". Come on folks...<br /><br />People are strange.<br /><br />Letters from Iwo Jima, and this is the first time I say this Cliche in 9 years of reviewing: is unflinching. There are times when you wish the camera would leave a little more to the imagination, sure, but war is brutal. This film is brutal. But, it is nice to see a film that has not become "pearlharborized" and suggestive.<br /><br />The center of the plot in one sentence: The Japanese side of Iwo Jima. I'll tell you what though, there is a lot to it. I left both this film and Flags with a greater appreciation of the men on both sides. Also, a greater understanding of the rediculousness of it all. I mean, as far as some of the ideology of the soldiers. Stepping on toes is a thing of mine. Ofcourse, theologically, we have the benefit of hindsight. Blah.<br /><br />Are there problems with the movie? Yeah. Are there problems with Citizen Kane and Fargo? Yeah. (grrr...afi) Some of the problems, as aforementioned by some, was the lack of display of the 20,000 Japanese. Ofcourse if history tells us that the soldiers were always scattered across the island, in caves etc..., one sweeping shot of massive bunched hordes would be an unfaithful recount.<br /><br />Side Note: The Acting is Brilliant.<br /><br />I don't know. There are many people willing to repeat over and over all those little details that apparently MANY feel obligated to restate, but not I. I loved the movie, but this is a rant, and it's done. ~Sir Adam of Scots~</p></br><a href="../users/A5A2QE6NECFR5.html">A5A2QE6NECFR5</a><br/><p>Where Clint's production of the best-selling book by James Bradley about the Iwo Jima fight came off as slightly disappointing, his retelling of the battle from the doomed Japanese soldier's point of view is brilliant. I normally do not like subtitles, but here the story is so interesting that the titles are just a minor annoyance. This one deserves the honors it brought to Eastwood, and to the major actors in it. The emotional wallop here is what eluded Eastwood when he recreated the American side of the month-long fight on that island in 1945. If you care about World War II, this is a "must see." If you hate the Japanese for the cruelty of their troops, and for their stubborn refusal to surrender even when battle outcomes were obvious, this film explains their reasoning. It will not convert you to their side, of course, but it does humanize their patriots. Watch both "Flags of Our Fathers" and "Letters from Iwo Jima" in the same week, and you will be a graduate of a mini-course in the psychology and horrors of war from two different major world cultures.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>We very rarely see a movie that portrays what goes on behind enemy lines. To us, Japan was the enemy, and to Japan, vice versa, so it was sort of interesting to watch the happenings on the other side of things. That said, the movie itself is somewhat on the bland side, especially the first half. Truly not much happened, it was all just a waiting game. When the battles actually begin, it is very intense and graphic. Especially the suicide scenes. Very poignant and true. The acting was very solid throughout. The only gripe I have is with the subtitles. They were somewhat hard to read in certain scenes. Either they were not on the screen long enough, or they were just hard to make out in contrast with the scene background. I do not mind reading subtitles, I just wish they stood out a little better in this film. I don't know how much of this film is historically accurate, but that is difficult to achieve with any war film. But this one is certainly worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood's "Letters From Iwo Jima" is an interesting departure from the traditional American war narrative that presents the Japanese army as merely a bunch of ruthless, fanatical, implacable killers who made life a living hell for the American troops that fought them in the Pacific theatre.  Here, we see gradations and nuances among the Japanese soldiers that are not typically part of the story -- draftees, sad sacks and proto-pacifists, pitted against martinets, fanatics and sadistic officers, as well as officers and high commanders who had different philosophies and different kinds of military training from one another, and who did not always agree on how best to fight the war.<br /><br />Although it is not by any means a perfect film, it is powerful.  It's certainly much better than the companion piece, Eastwood's "American" Iwo Jima film, "Flags Of Our Fathers," which I found muddled and often trite. "Letters" is clearly the film that was most important to Eastwood to get right -- he pours more feeling into it, and gave it a much stronger and more cohesive narrative.  I agree that it's not the greatest war film ever made, but it does open up a new dialogue on some important historical issues, and presents, however obliquely, a tragic picture of the death of Japan's vestigial bushido honor code on the pyre of modern mass warfare.<br /><br />I think this film does an adequate job of presenting Japanese wartime society as a spectrum of opinions and temperaments -- it's simplistic, yes, but that is the nature of a feature film script, and to the degree that Eastwood does *not* present the Japanese as a monolithic culture, I think the film is a success.  The portrayal of Iwo Jima as a doomed, desperate last stand -- an Asian Alamo, if you will -- is interesting as well, although Eastwood may oversell this point, and gives little indication (in this film) of how tough formidable the Japanese soldiers were, or the degree to which they had an efficient, modern military.  By the time of this battle, their fleet had been crushed and their supply lines and command and control were breaking down so looking just at this moment in time is a little misleading, although not entirely inaccurate.  I'm not a big WWII buff, but I think its obvious that Eastwood has walked a fine line between different factions who choose to view history in various ways.  And, yes, it's a Hollywood film, so it resorts to melodrama and simplification... Yet it still presents a viewpoint that has rarely been seen, particularly by American audiences.  It's worth adding to our historical repertoire, and gives us some new shadings of understanding about the war, putting a more human face on was has been traditionally portrayed as a near-inhuman foe.  It's worth checking out, and seems to have been a labor of love on Eastwood's part.

American students of the War in the Pacific respect the Japanese soldier's martial spirit in general and the Japanese on Iwo Jima in particular.  What's objectionable is the portrayal of U.S. soldiers casually shooting prisoners of war.  Did such a thing happen in the War in the Pacific?  I'm sure it did, but there's no record of it happening during the battle of Iwo Jima, and it's a distortion to include that scene, which is hypothetical in this case and is given a prominent place in the movie's plot.*  In a small way it's like De Palma's "Redacted": based on some truth but leaving out so much context that it becomes a de facto lie.  Shame on you Clint!  Shame!<br /><br />*  Do people judge FDR prominently on his treatment of Japanese-Americans during the War?</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>After thoroughly enjoying Clint Eastwood's "Flags of Our Fathers", I was inspired to check out his Japanese-perspective companion piece "Letters From Iwo Jima".  Although the film was not bad by any means, it failed (were so many other Eastwood films have succeeded) to really surprise me or get me thinking about deeper issues.<br /><br />Basically, the film centers on the Iwo Jima invasion in the Pacific Theater of World War II, only from the Japanese army perspective.  The technical aspects of the battle, such as defending Mt. Suribachi, are discussed, but the movie really is about showing the differences between what the U.S. and Japan viewed as being honorable in battle.  Whereas the U.S. would give it's all and then retreat (to save lives) if the battle was not deemed winnable, Japanese soldiers were expected to die at their post (a sort of throw-back to the old samurai Bushido culture), even if that meant committing suicide so as not to be taken prisoner.<br /><br />While it was interesting to become more educated on these differences, I found there to be too few "wow" moments during the film.  I came in with the expectation of seeing the Iwo Jima battle from the Japanese perspective, and that is exactly what I got...no more, no less.  It's not like Eastwood's other recent films (Million Dollar Baby, Gran Torino, etc.), where they build on complex themes and touch on heavy societal issues.  This one is more cut-and-dry.<br /><br />One positive area I would like to single out, however, is the musical score.  The plinking piano and soulful strings of Kyle Eastwood did more to tug at my heart-strings than any of the character performances.  Eastwood (both Sr. and Jr.) has developed quite a positive reputation for the music of his films, and in no way does this one disappoint.<br /><br />Thus, if able, I would have given this film a "3.5 star" rating.  It's better than "just okay" due to the interesting perspective and touching music, but not quite "really good" because of the lack of emotional depth.  Also, the sooner you watch it after "Flags of our Fathers", the better, as the subject matter will be fresh in your brain.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>Being a big Clint Eastwood fan, I attended "Flags of our Fathers" earlier this year expecting a monumental experience.  Nothing could have surprised me more, however, with how disconnected I felt from that picture.  It was a fascinating story and a nice tribute, but its awkward narrative framing and (more importantly) lack of genuine character development disappointed me.  All I felt left with was a heavy-handed message with no real dramatic weight.  I still looked forward to "Letters From Iwo Jima," however, intrigued by Eastwood's ambitions of portraying a Japanese perspective centered on the same event.  Such a bold move makes me respect Eastwood even more.  The film was rushed into release for the 2006 awards season when "Flags" failed to become a critical front-runner, and that decision seems to have paid off for the studio.  Recognized by several major critic's groups, "Letters" also stands as a Best Picture candidate at the Academy awards.<br /><br />Ironically, the aspect that left me unmoved with "Flags" is the strongest asset of "Letters"--and that is character development.  Spending time with a handful of major characters, the film does a nice job fleshing them out in a real three-dimensional way.  The film intimately examines their situation on Iwo Jima, the hopelessness, the strategizing.  The interactions between the soldiers is well developed and genuine, and the incorporation of writing letters as a narrative device provides even more insight.  We get to "hear" their thoughts and to explore their backstory.  The moments that we step away from Iwo Jima in flashbacks are well integrated and provide a greater emotional context for their current situation.<br /><br />As for plot, the film explores the American invasion of Iwo Jima.  Near the end of the war, the Japanese soldiers left to maintain this stronghold have become increasingly isolated and unsupported from the mainland.  With a new, somewhat controversial, General in command--it quickly becomes clear that this is a mission of holding on until death.  American victory seems assured--so with honor, dignity and sacrifice, all the remaining soldiers are being asked to die in the name of duty.  Building a complex system of bunkers within the mountain, they are (in essence) constructing their own graves.  When the invasion actually begins, the battle scenes are harrowing and believable--and the awesome underground cavern system is a claustrophobic and memorable set piece.<br /><br />One of the main popular criticisms of "Letters" comes from a perceived revisionist approach.  By viewing the film's characters as protagonists with humanity, is it glossing over the atrocities committed in a wartime situation?  And obviously, a legitimate movie could have been made to depict this too--but this isn't that movie.  This is a film that examines a few individuals struggling with a moral code which is at odds with a desire to live.  Not every Japanese soldier was a monster, nor was every German or Italian--but neither is every American soldier a saint.  What the film has endeavored to impart is that, most importantly, we're all human.  The average Japanese soldier had a lot in common with the average American soldier.  The film is a tad heavy-handed in those connections, on occasion, but I personally had no problem seeing the characters in "Letters" as sympathetic and real.<br /><br />The performances in "Letters" are uniformly excellent.  The script is tight and logical, the color palette refreshingly bleak, and the staging impressive.  There is a certain dignity and honor in the film--a certain respectful sense of dread as we are led to the inevitable conclusion.  A truly memorable and compassionate piece, I recommend "Letters" without reservation.

The film is an attempt to portray the humanistic qualities of Japanese soldier, and not so much focus on the ravage combat scenes that occurred on the island but rather the activities inside the crevasses of the caves that the soldiers occupied at an attempt to maintain Japanese possession of Mount Suribachi.  There are similar battle scenes that were shown during Flags of Our Fathers, but the emphasis is the soldiers.<br /><br />Eastwood focuses on two of the characters, General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) and a baker and young soldier, Saigo (Kaizunari Ninomayi), and parallels their lives and to the war experience.  Through short conversations and long silences and interactions between Japanese soldiers and American soldiers, Eastwood is effective in conveying the Japanese perspective.  Certain scenes may shock and disturb viewers who are not familiar with the events that coincided with what occurred during the Pacific War - a war heavily fought with psychological warfare and propaganda in mind.  For example, as Japanese soldiers talk about American soldiers they too describe them as savage and inhumane.  Where have we heard that before?  They were depicted in propaganda cartoons, which spread racist and jingoist fervor within the minds of those who believed it.  But what is interesting about this film as well as Flags of Our Fathers is that both raises questions about morality, sacrifice, and brutality among enemy combatants as well as concerns of human rights during times of war.<br /><br />Bottom line, Letters From Iwo Jima is revisionist history, which revises one's perception of Japanese and American soldiers during World War II.  Eastwood emphasizes the humanistic qualities of each soldier portrayed in the movie including the commanding officer of the Japanese army, which show that they too were human; they too left family behind and hastily wrote letters home to loved ones.  There are subtle scenes of humor in the film, but with a tinge of irony, such as when a few soldiers suffer extreme cases of dysentery, but are able to laugh about it.  And another is with Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara), a debonair and "playboy-like" officer, who oddly enough lands on the island with his prized horse.  Scenes involving Nishi is a short respite from the battle front, and this is displayed as he comforts a wounded American soldier from Oklahoma, Sam, that he takes in as a prisoner of war and nurses the soldier's wounds despite the dismay from Japanese soldiers.  In the little time that he spends with Sam, he shares with him a little piece of information about his own life when he was an Olympic athlete during the 1932 Olympics in California, possibly an equestrian, who happened to know two Hollywood actors of the day, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks.  What is ironic about this scene is a preceding scene in which another American soldier was dragged into the Japanese army's cave, but suffered a much greater consequence.<br /><br />Letter From Iwo Jima is an intense film filled with unanswered inquiries, which opens the door for discussion.  Undeniably, the film raises the controversial issue of revisionist history within the context of American and Japanese history, and uncovers stereotypes and misconceptions.  This film is recommended viewing for anyone interested in having a better understanding of the Pacific War and history in general.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This film blows away all the stereotypes that Americans have been fed over the last half-century about the Japanese.  Yes, Clint Eastwood is an American director.  But the film "feels" Japanese, and it's not only because, with the exception of just a scene or two, it is entirely in the Japanese language.  It's because the Japanese deeply-held tradition of dying with honor is so clearly depicted, so much so that it was easy for me to understand and identify where they were coming from.<br /><br />The film opens in the present day, as a cache of letters is discovered and carefully dug up.  I understand that some of these letters really do exist and had been published recently in Japan.  These letters form the narrative structure of the film.  It works very well.<br /><br />The rest of the film takes place in 1944, and  here we get to meet a full spectrum of Japanese soldiers.  We identify with them.  We feel their suffering as they all realize that this is truly their last stand and that are all going to die.  There is hunger, there is fear, there is discipline.  And, most clearly, there are their individual reactions to what is going on around them.  Ken Watanabe is cast as the General.  Kazara Ninomiya is cast as a young soldier who yearns to return to his wife and baby daughter.  And then there are all the other men -- the officer who was once an Olympic equestrian and had visited America, the young man who was sent to the front because he was too softhearted to be in an elite troop, and all of those who chose suicide missions or death by their own hands over surrender.  It is a huge and sad story.  I am glad it has been finally told in its entirety.<br /><br />The battle of Iwo Jima was a decisive one.  The Americans sent 100,000 men to rout out the Japanese soldiers who saw Iwo Jima as a part of Japan and were defending the Island.  Seven thousand Americans died, 20,000 were wounded.  And of the 20,000 Japanese defending the Island, only about 1,000 of them survived. The film seems to be shot in black and white and so, in a way, it seems like a film that might have been made during those early war days.  However, this is the year 2007 and graphic artists have mastered the techniques of working with colors.  And so, the color saturation varies scene by scene.  Some of the scenes inside the caves seem to have a warm red glow.  And during the battle scenes, the flames erupt in bright yellows and orange.  Other times, the faces of the men are in shadow or half shadow.  All of this certainly enhanced the realism and the mood.<br /><br />"Letters from Iwo Jima" is a masterpiece.  And yet, it is not for everybody.  The subtitles alone might dissuade some.  And inevitable sad ending will keep others away.  But students of history and human nature will applaud the genius of it all.  And a story that needed to be told is now available for world-wide audiences.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>And you would have had a decent picture of the Japanese side of Iwo Jima.  But, a thoroughly unneccesary section of the film where first a captured Marine is treated humanely by Baron Nishi, and then shortly thereafter, surrendered Japanese prisoners are executed by another Marine, sits in politically correct smugness smack in the middle of an otherwise decent film.  It may make the "anti-war" message, but it rang false, and at that point the film faltered.  True, earlier a Marine captive was shown beaten and bayoneted, but this was juxtaposed with another Japanese being burned to death, as if the Marine captive was being punished for that death.  The reality of these battles was something else.<br /><br />The historian William Manchester was a young Marine in the Pacific and in his book Goodbye Darkness, about his experiences, said that there was a tacit understanding between the Marines and Japanese in the island campaigns: neither side took many prisoners.  At least while the battle was raging.  That was just the way it was. Each campaign was a fight to the death.  He also pointed out that the Marines always had help from native islanders against the Japanese, not because the islanders loved Marines or even knew what an American was, but because they hated the Japanese because of their brutality toward these conquered peoples.<br /><br />Too bad, because otherwise this was a fine film pretty fairly showing the view from the other side of the cultural divide.  It demonstrates the crazy waste and harshness of the Bushido code, most especially as it is sternly and unthinkingly applied to the average drafted Japanese soldier.  It illustrates how these unyielding notions caused the needless sacrifice of their own troops in forced personal suicide and suicidal frontal assaults on fixed positions.  It also showed the human dimension of these men left to do nothing else but die on that sulfurous rock.  I had no problems with those elements of the film that depicted the common humanity of men with families and love of their country.<br /><br />I liked the view of the unconventional General Kuribayashi's strategy, often undone by the willfully obtuse views of his own officers, and the equally effective view of life as lived by the common soldier, often starved and beaten by these same latter day samurai.  The action scenes, as in Flags of Our Fathers, were well done and the production design I so admired in that film is, of course, still present here.<br /><br />I liked the actors and the interplay between them.  I admire the production values and this is often a quiet and interesting film.  I certainly have no problem with seeing the flip side of the battle depicted in Flags of Our Fathers.  I think the film was doing quite well in depicting the humanity of soldiers who, by and large, would rather be home or anywhere else.  It didn't need any extra "message" slipped in, and while it might not bother others, I found it an unneccessary excess plea, and a bit disingenuous.  At any rate, the film is worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood's "Letters from Iwo Jima" is the perfect counterpoint to "Flags of Our Fathers": the latter, like so many other war movies, focuses solely on the American characters; the former, on the other hand, gives the audience a first hand look into the lives of Japanese soldiers. Rarely do we get to watch a war story from the opposite side. It was quite a refreshing and eye opening experience, especially since it didn't dehumanize a single character. I say this in spite of the fact that many gruesome death and destruction scenes are featured, each side fighting for what they believe to be right. This film depicts war from the "enemy's" point of view; it's an experience I recommend to everyone, especially to those who have only seen one-sided commentaries.<br /><br />As the title suggests, characters frequently write letters to loved ones back on the Japanese mainland. Mostly taking place in 1944, we hear the thoughts and feelings of two soldiers--General Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) and Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya)--as they write, bringing to the story an emotional depth that's incredibly compelling. Saigo writes to his wife, Hanako (Nae Yuuki), who was pregnant when he was called to duty by the Japanese government. He understandably wants to return home, not only to reunite with his wife, but also to meet his baby daughter for the first time. Such things are repeatedly said in his letters, as are general complaints about their hardships and their grueling daily activities.<br /><br />While stationed on the island of Iwo Jima, the soldiers prepare for America's inevitable attack. They must do a multitude of tasks: digging trenches, hollowing out caves, arming weapons, etc. But what makes their situation even more difficult is the fairly low morale among the soldiers; despite their service to their country, despite believing that they will die honorably, many seem to know that they're fighting a losing battle; most of their forces have been destroyed, and they're clearly not ready to do battle on the island. It doesn't help that the soldiers are being served tainted water, causing widespread dysentery. After weeks of such conditions, many are willing to surrender the island to American forces. Saigo makes the mistake of suggesting this out loud as their hotheaded captain, Tanida (Takumi Bando), passes by. Apparently, saying such things is unpatriotic and disgraceful; he certainly makes this clear as he beats Saigo with a whip.<br /><br />Then enters Kuribayashi, a levelheaded man of surprising emotional strength (as shown during scenes of letter writing to his unseen daughter). He notices Tanida's outburst and immediately points out that a good captain uses his brain, not just his whip. Already, this puts him at odds with other military officers, who begin to feel that he's better off behind a desk than commanding an army. They also grow increasingly suspicious of his proposed strategies; he believes that digging a trench along the beach is a waste of time, and that the soldiers should focus their attention on caves underneath the mountains. As the film progresses, feelings against the general rise, especially when they learn that he had spent some time in America.<br /><br />Indeed, his feelings for the Americans are not as clear-cut as most of the other soldiers'. They were raised to believe that Americans were a weak, inferior people, easily succumbing to emotional impulses when out on the battlefield. By the time combat begins on the island, many Japanese soldiers realize that what they were taught to believe was wrong. There's an especially powerful scene in which the Japanese takes in a wounded American soldier. The superior officer orders that he be treated, not killed. His reasoning is simple: any one of his soldiers would do the same for him. "An American would never treat a Japanese soldier!" protests a young officer. "Have you ever met one?" is the commander's reply, which was a profound thing to say. The complex relationship between the opposing armies grows deeper after the wounded soldier awakens; he and a Japanese soldier engage in a very cordial conversation.<br /><br />If only the world's problems could be fixed that easily. Unfortunately, a war is raging, and not everyone is ready to put all differences aside. The Japanese know this all too well: their ammunition is rapidly dwindling, as is their food and water supply; reinforcements will not be sent; soldiers are dying left and right. Some soldiers resort to suicide, believing that they should die honorably as opposed to fighting a losing battle. A very graphic yet important scene shows a number of soldiers with hand grenades, activating them while holding them tightly to their chests. One can't help but question the mentality of anyone willing to die so needlessly, especially since they had the chance (albeit an incredibly slim one) of surviving the war and returning home.<br /><br />At a certain point in the film, Saigo buries a sack full of unsent letters, none of which would be found until 2005, when a research team discovers them. A shot of the letters falling from the open sack is extremely poignant, with the voices of the soldiers overlapping one another. That scene in particular shows the greatest amount of humanity, and I thank the filmmakers for including it. Much like "Flags of Our Fathers," "Letters from Iwo Jima" is not a film that glorifies war in any way; rather, it gives a face to the violence and bloodshed that was World War II, a face that we have rarely been given the chance to see. It was both brave and necessary for a war film to show America's "enemies" as human beings, with hopes, fears, and loves. For that reason alone, this film needs to be seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RTMB76CJWY9U.html">A3RTMB76CJWY9U</a><br/><p>In order to appreciate my review of this film, I want you to picture the conditions in which I saw it: I was late to the theater, and the place was packed (6:30 showing on a Saturday night at a popular mall). My fiancee and I were relegated to the very, very front seats--the ones no one sits in--to the far right of the auditorium. We were probably less than ten feet from the screen. It was then that we discovered that the entire film was in subtitles; my fiancee later commented that we had to create our own "Pan and Scan" to watch the film. Consider also: 2 and a half hours long. My neck was aching from about minute 10.<br /><br />And yet...<br /><br />I really enjoyed the movie. At 2 1/2 hours, it never felt long. I didn't regret being so close, usually enough to make any movie unbearably awkward. This is a smart, powerful film, engrossing from start to finish, and it made me lose myself to my surroundings, to join with the soldiers striving to defend their homes on a poor island in the Pacific.<br /><br />Specifically, it's the story of the battle of Iwo Jima from the point of view of the Japanese, and of the commander who had to wage an impossible battle. Against the American forces? Perhaps, but really the impossible battle was against his own troops and culture, which were of a tradition-bound mentality that severely tied his hands.<br /><br />Beyond war, it's also a human story, as the "letters" give us background on several of the players, and show us how the Japanese soldiers in that army were every bit as individualistic as anyone else, despite serving a society that strove to deny the individual.<br /><br />In many ways, this is a bleak film, served up in a suiting palette of muted greys and browns (the movie almost appears black and white, at times). It is sad, because we know ahead of time what the result will be for the Japanese that we grow to like over the course of the tale, but within it are moments of bravery, heroism and friendship.<br /><br />I'm glad for movies like this--to show us the humanity of other peoples, times and cultures, and even ones that were, once, our "enemies." Clint Eastwood handles this difficult subject with style and respect, and delivers an emotional, enveloping tale of men pushed to their brink.<br /><br />Wonderful movie. Five stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A6DOCZ10B7JAJ.html">A6DOCZ10B7JAJ</a><br/><p>This really is a phenomenal achievement by Eastwood, presenting an objective look at the Battle of Iwo Jima from the Japanese perspective.<br /><br />Ken Watanabe once again has such a commanding presence, like he did in The Last Samurai.  Here he plays General Kuribayashi, a wise commander whose unconventional methods causes much dissension down throughout the ranks.<br /><br />What I found stunning with this character was his past relationship with America.  He had lived in America, had many close American friends, and had a genuine respect and admiration for the country he was forced to fight against.  He also knew the insurmountable odds stacked against him in this battle but was ready to die with honor for his country.<br /><br />Letters from Iwo Jima really depicts the emotional hardships that come with any war.  Plus it has wonderful character development that really gives you no choice but to connect with soldiers on both sides.  It also spends the vast majority of time focusing on the war itself, which is another reason why I found this movie much more profound and enjoyable than Flags of our Fathers.<br /><br />Eastwood explicitly demonstrates that when it comes to war, there is no right or wrong, good or bad, fair or unfair...<br /><br />There is only death.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TMAVN4CEM8U8.html">A1TMAVN4CEM8U8</a><br/><p>Letters From Iwo Jima  DVD<br /><br />Letters From Iwo is a companion piece to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O77QDI">Flags of Our Fathers (Two-Disc Special Edition) [HD DVD</a>], both directed by Clint Eastwood, both about the circumstances surrounding the battle for Iwo Jima.  This movie is told from the Japanese point of view.<br /><br />If the movie is true, unfortunately the Japanese general was competent, when he first arrived, he got off his plane and walked the terrain, he did not just go into the operations center and look at maps.<br /><br />He then completely scrapped the defensive plan.  Moved the revetments so that the machine guns had enfilading fire. Moved the artillery back to the military crest on the mountain. Then dug in his troops into the mountains, rendering the U.S. Naval bombardment effectively impotent.<br /><br />If we'd had today's liberal media back then, we would have quit after the first one thousand soldiers and marines were killed.<br /><br />I for one am glad we didn't have instant communication in 1944.<br /><br />Highly recommended for military buffs and fans of World war II action movies.<br /><br />Gunner  February, 2008</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>This is a well-made, honorable movie that somehow didn't quite click on an emotional level for me.  I'm an admirer of Eastwood's understated directing style, where he let's the actors do some acting without having to add frantic editing and other tricks.  He clearly believes that well-written characters, well-played by well-cast performers is about 80% of the trick to directing a good film...and he's mostly correct.  MILLION DOLLAR BABY, MYSTIC RIVER & UNFORGIVEN are but a few examples of his "less is more" style.  They are longish movies that give the viewer time to get to know the characters...yet they never really drag either.<br /><br />LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA is extremely well-crafted, and is well-acted by a group of actors largely unknown to American audiences (exception being Ken Watanabee, whom we all got to know for his excellent work in THE LAST SAMURAI).  The young men who portray the doomed troops abandoned by Japan to defend the rocky island of Iwo Jima are all very good, and it takes almost no time at all to get used to reading the subtitles.<br /><br />Eastwood also does a good job of evoking the landscape of the island.  I've never been, so I don't know if it's accurate, but my impression after seeing the film is that this rock was a pretty uninteresting place.  Lots of desert landscapes, with volcanic  hills and very dusty beaches (there are some evocative scenes of soldiers going up the dunes near the ocean, kicking up so much dust that they can barely be seen).  It hardly looks like a  place worth shedding so much blood on.<br /><br />There are some powerful scenes.  The most horrific involves a scene of mass-suicide.  A squad of troops believes they have been ordered to kill themselves because they have failed to defend Mt. Suribachi from the Americans.  Some of the soldiers know that their general has ordered them to retreat to fight another day...but most refuse to credit this order and they begin to kill themselves one by one with hand grenades clutched to their bodies.  It's brutal and amazing.  You shake your head and wonder at the mindset that could lead to this.  And you also cringe for the young men who clearly are only doing what they feel their society wants them to do...none does it with anything but sadness.  It's a gory mess, and it will rattle the toughest moviegoer.<br /><br />Another good scene features the Japanese meeting a wounded American soldier.  The frightened American meets a Japanese officer who speaks English and has good things to say about America.  The soldier draws touching comfort from this gentle contact, and after he dies, the officer reads to his men a letter the young American had from his mother.  The soldiers are all greatly moved by this simple letter...it puts a human face on the enemy.<br /><br />But a lot of the film feels generic in its scenes.  It's hard to get any sense of the strategy being employed or of how much time is passing.  I have NO idea from watching the film how much time passes from when the Americans land to when the Japanese were completely defeated.  It feels like it could be two days or two weeks or even more.  To me, this is a mistake...a context that is lacking.  The film simply got a little repetitive.  Groups of outnumbered Japanese soldiers running from one spot to another, most of them being mowed down by American firepower on the way.  To me, rather than making me feel the random chaos of battle, I just felt like I was being left to fill in the blanks of what was going on for myself.<br /><br />Part of the problem is that this style of rapid-fire, chaotic "war action" was done so well with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN that it has frankly lost much of its power to stun.  Eastwood isn't quite the action-engineer that Spielberg is, so IWO JIMA suffers some in comparison.  RYAN did a darn fine job of showing me the carnage, randomness, brutality, gore, etc., etc. of men in battle.  That movie shook me to the core.  But sense that time, war movies that have followed cannot quite get the same feelings from me by showing similar (but inferior) scenes.  This is not to say that war movies have no power to stun anymore...far from it.  But these particular types of action scenes don't quite cut it anymore.  They feel derivative now.<br /><br />The best parts of IWO JIMA are the quieter times, when the men (of high rank and low) consider their impending deaths, and we feel their sense of loss.  The knowledge of all the things they won't be going home to.  Their desire to draw meaning from the sacrifices they know they are about to make.<br /><br />The movie is worth seeing, absolutely.  It is 140 minutes long, but the length was no issue for me.  I think I simply wasn't moved as much as the hype had led me to believe I would be.  I suggest going to see it without any preconceived ideas, if you can, and you will find it a unique glimpse at World War II, and at the effects of combat on those on the front lines.  Eastwood has done another stellar job on a film whose scale just occasionally exceeds his grasp.<br /><br />(On the subject of "revisionist" history...I too am a bit uncomfortable about the depiction of the Japanese as being on the same moral level as the Americans.  It is well-documented [Bataan Death March, anyone] that the Japanese commited many atrocities on a large scale level.  My own father-in-law often spoke of arriving at POW camps after they had been abandoned by the Japanese guards only to find all the detainees had been slaughtered.  Someone needs to make a modern day movie version of James Clavell's KING RAT to show some of that horror.)</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>The flip side of "Flag of Our Fathers," this Japanese language film is a little too long for its own good. The tale told from Japan's perspective grows a little tedious, but you do see things from an alternate point of view. The praise is somewhat unwarranted, because, ultimately, there is nothing especially revealing or surprising here, just an expected take on what it must have been like to be a Japanese soldier on Iwo Jima. Worth watching in tandem with the other film, at your leisure.</p></br><a href="../users/A345WVAVMMO6F0.html">A345WVAVMMO6F0</a><br/><p>the second part of clint eastwoods paean to the legendary ww2 battle came out to intense praise from critics last year, and while its a perfectly good war movie, im at a loss to understand where its supposed to be great.  is it that this tells the tale from the "enemy" point of view?  well, i can go back as far as "all quiet on the western front" at least for a similar concept.  yes, war is horrid and the enemy is not so very different from us: i have seen it before.  good battle sequences, good acting, good movie -- but a masterpiece?  no.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Austere, reverent, documentary-like in its depiction of the Japanese attempt to defend Iwo Jima at the end of WW2, Clint Eastwood's "Letters from Iwo Jima" never quite achieves the greatness that his earlier companion WW2 piece. "Flags of Our Fathers" attains though its pleasures are many.<br />This film stars the great Japanese star, Ken Watanabe as General Kuribayashi sent by the powers-that-be to Iwo Jima to take charge of a mission that is doomed in that, at this point in the war, the Japanese fleet has been destroyed and no help is available to Kuribayashi and his meager, barely trained troops. General Kuribayashi is in Iwo Jima then to serve Japan and to die with honor. Watanabe's Kuribayashi goes about his desperate project with the zeal and fervor of a man, though he is well aware of the inevitable outcome, who cares nothing about saving his own hide but only that of his soldiers: he is caring, loving, intelligent and exceedingly world weary. This is a nuanced and emotionally available performance by Watanabe.<br />"LFIJ" is filmed in Japanese and told from the Japanese point of view and frankly it feels a little strange rooting for this rag-tag group of officers and soldiers particularly since the USA is the "enemy."  Eastwood's point of view then is finely tuned with a deep sense of respect for the Japanese yet I can't help feeling that Eastwood is stacking the deck here by not mentioning and/or ignoring the many atrocities that the Japanese perpetrated on China and others during this same period.<br />Filmed in sepia tones with splashes of color, "Letters from Iwo Jima" is beautifully filmed by Tom Stern and ultimately it is a deeply affecting and thoughtful depiction of men at war: some filled with duty and honored to be there and others merely fulfilling their conscriptions.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JXAQ92WYPAAR.html">A2JXAQ92WYPAAR</a><br/><p>What a disappointment. Gosh, I had heard so much about this movie and had somehow drawn the conclusion that life itself would be enhanced after viewing it. However, the film did little for me at all. I thought it a great bore, highly sentimental, strangely unrealistic, anti-Japanese and anti-American. In the first place, the film emphasizes the Japanese concept of honor but then shows the officers acting with shameless dishonor. The General, who is depicted as a solid guy, can't find anyone willing to obey his orders. The officers are so eager to commit suicide, it is a wonder they waited for the American to attack. Virtually every command made by an officer to an enlisted man is greeted with, "yeah, but..." instead of "yes, sir." It is chaos down in those tunnels. One group is going one way, while another is going another. The General's orders never get delivered, and anyone who wants to fight is killed for disobeying the order to commit suicide. I don't believe anything like this took place. The one American captured is fed and treated with precious medicines, but the one Japanese captured by the Americans is shot on the spot, white flag in hand. The fat, smoking soldier who shoots him point blank can't be bothered to guard him. The Japanese come off as the keystone cops, while the Americans, presumably led by Darth Vader, are well-fed, heartless slobs. More Japanese are killed by each other than by the enemy. When they are not swinging their swords at each other, they are aiming their pistols. There are three guys in particular whose job it is to kill as many of their fellow soldiers as possible, for fear they might say something against the Emperor, or fail to kill themselves at the first sight of the enemy. These loud-mouths are extremely obnoxious. I am not sure what Clint Eastwood wanted to achieve by making this "culturally sensitive" nonsense, but I am now persuaded that his aims have nothing to do with art and everything to do with propaganda. Was this supposed to make me see that the Japanese are human too? "Can't we just get along?" Well, I for one am all in favor of getting along, but it is hard to stand by in silence while watching one country destroy another. I'd advise Mr. Eastwood to read the history of the Japanese in Asia, beginning with Korea.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Letters from Iwo Jima" presents the Battle of Iwo Jima, where American and Japanese troops clashed in 1945, from the Japanese point of view, as a companion piece to director Clint Eastwood's "Flags of Our Fathers", which addressed the American experience of the same battle. This film is partly based on letters written by Japanese who perished there, but many characters and conversations are fictional. Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) determines that a conventional beach defense of Iwo Jima will quickly fail and orders the creation of an extensive tunnel system and a northern defensive line. Kuribayashi's unorthodox strategy breeds dissent among his officers, while he prepares the troops to fight a losing battle against the approaching American armada. The trials and fears of the average soldier are represented by Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya), a reluctant but resigned Private, who thinks of his family back home and runs afoul of his strict superiors.<br /><br />"Letters from Iwo Jima" imbues Japanese soldiers with American values in order to make them sympathetic, and it posits the two wisest officers, General Kuribayashi and Lt. Colonel Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara), as more enlightened for having had contact with American culture. This might be interpreted as American ethnocentrism, but I think that the implication is simply that these men are better-equipped to understand their enemy, because they are more worldly than many of their compatriots. Japan's isolation and ignorance of other cultures led to grave miscalculations during World War II. General Kuribayashi opposed the war with the United States that he died fighting. The familiar values that the soldiers reveal through their letters and interactions seem more like a missed opportunity to present the Japanese mindset than a serious cultural blunder.<br /><br />Once I mulled over the film's obvious manipulations, however, I found that there was little else. "Letters from Iwo Jima" presents a vague, impressionistic view of the Battle of Iwo Jima. We can't make out much of the Japanese strategy, what is going on, or how long it lasts. The battle lasted nearly 40 days, whereas the film gives the impression of about a week. This film ignores the Battle's salient points in favor of sentimentality: The Japanese soldiers are honorable, loyal men who would nevertheless rather be at home with their families than burned alive in a futile attempt to defend a useless little island. I never would have guessed. This doesn't do General Kuribayashi's daring strategy justice or comment on Japan's decision to sacrifice 20,000 men, without air or sea support, in a stalling tactic. The substance and drama are in the strategic decisions, rationale, and implications, which the film relegates to background. "Letters from Iwo Jima" does everything it can to avoid pointed analysis and embrace cliches.<br /><br />The washed-out color palette struck me from the first frame of the first scene. "Letters from Iwo Jima" is in color but desaturated to the point of nearly monochrome, like a faded old photograph. Desaturating the color can be useful in films where a lot of bright red blood would distract the audience from other elements. This palette isn't unattractive, but my eyes never got used to it. My mind involuntarily kept concentrating to make out the color. This was distracting. The other visually notable feature is the scenes of American Marines invading the beaches of Iwo Jima, which are quite beautiful, but alas do not look remotely real. They are obviously CGI. The cinematographic stylization is probably too heavy-handed for its own good, which would not be a first for Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />The superficiality of "Letters from Iwo Jima" might not bother me if this material were not so rich in drama, irony, and insight: An opponent of war with America leads his troops to certain death against Americans. 20,000 men consigned to cannon fodder to buy a little time. Kuribayashi and Baron Nishi did not get along, which is more interesting than the trite friendship in the movie. A smart commander hampered by foolish underlings. A heroic defense of a hopeless cause. A completely different world view. Some Japanese soldiers lived in the tunnels for years afterward, because they didn't dare surrender. That would have made a nice epilogue if anyone really wanted to make a film about the Japanese perspective. And Iwo Jima was of no value to either Japan or the US. What could be better material for a thoughtful war movie? I was entertained by "Letters from Iwo Jima", but Clint Eastwood has managed to transform an incisive, disturbing moment in human history into something vague, mawkish, and utterly without substance. In Japanese with English, French or Spanish subtitles.</p></br><a href="../users/A3572FTYUQQW3P.html">A3572FTYUQQW3P</a><br/><p>Clearly Eastwood attempted to make an anti-war film equivalent to "All Quiet ON The Western Front" but he failed.  The film was intended to humanize the Japanese and was very politically correct since it showed the Japanese in a very positive light while showing the Americans as brutal.  The scene where the American soldiers shot the prisoners was totally out of context and clearly placed there to reinforce the usual Hollywood view of the American Military.  The film failed to show or even indicate any of the brutality or inhumanity shown by the Japanese to their prisoners or even civilians.  This was a sad film but very one-sided and even distorted since it failed to show the actual conduct of the Japanese outside of the futility of the Bushido code.  The Japanese soldiers were shown as reluctant soldiers who were actually being victimized by their leaders and the Bushido code, while the few views of the Americans showed them as murderers.<br /><br />I usually avoid all Hollywood films dealing with the military because they are always anti-military and anti-American military in particular and this film was no different.  It was well done from a techical viewpoint and for that reason I gave it four stars but if you have ever been in the American Military this is just another backhanded slap at soldiers.  It is an anti-war film but it never shows any context for the war or the consequences of not fighting.<br /><br />Actually this could be seen as an anti-anti-war film because it can be viewed as a lesson in siege warfare.  It is an excellent examination of the practical problems facing the commander of a fortress when put under siege.  It demonstrates that the commander can only last as long as his supplies and must be relieved from outside.  A failure to gain relief can only result in an erosion of morale and loss of effectiveness.  From the that perspective this was a good training film.<br /><br />But in the end this was just another Hollywood film that once agains shows that Hollywood believes war is an American invention and that all that is needed is talk and a few choruses of Kumbaya.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>This is the first movie that I have ever seen about WWII from the Japanese point of view.  The severe discipline, crossing the line to arbitrary cruelty, was apparent in the leaders.  The humanity of the ordinary Japanese soldier was contrasted to their superiors.<br /><br />Not all peoples act the same, although this movie tried to show ambivalence on the part of some American soldiers.  American cruelty in WWII was not comparable to that of any other soldiers and any attempt to show the contrary is just wrong.  Our fighters were no angels, but they did not display anything like the inhumanity shown by one patrolman on the streets of his home town, nor would our soldiers demand wholesale suicide when things take a turn south.<br /><br />A good movie but it would have been better without attempts at political correctness.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>In my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M4RG42">Flags of Our Fathers</a>, I mentioned that I wasn't sure if I'd be watching this flipside film based on the Japanese experience. My fears were twofold. First is that director Clint Eastwood lacks character development, and I was afraid he'd continue his trend with LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA. Second (and more recently noted within myself) is that I absolutely love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHSVSC">Tora! Tora! Tora!</a> Similarities between it and the new Eastwood additions cannot be denied. Although Tora focused on the Pearl Harbor attack and not Iwo Jima, it did look at both sides of the war (Japan and America.) I feared that Dirty Harry might muddy the film-waters of Tora! Tora! Tora!<br /><br />Thankfully the latter didn't happen, but the former trend continues.<br /><br />With the exception of Ken Watanabe's (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHRVMY">Memoirs of a Geisha</a>) portrayal of General Kuribayashi and Kazunari Ninomiya's Saigo, there were few characters with which the audience could identify. We care little for any of these doomed men simply because we don't know them well enough. The story itself is historically interesting, of course, and it's well told. But the lack of empathy viewers will have for any of the characters will likely plague this film to its bitter end.<br /><br />Where Tora! Tora! Tora! succeeded was not simply in its storytelling, but also in that we got in tight with everyone involved. From Martin Balsam's gruff Pacific Fleet Admiral to So Yamamura's demanding Vice-Admiral Yamamoto presence, all of the characters had some important measure within the film's scheme. Clint Eastwood seems to have had trouble doing this with two lengthy movies (Flags was 132 minutes long and Letters 141 minutes while Tora alone was just 144 minutes.)<br /><br />The thing I don't want to do here is disrespect (in any way) what happened on this little spit of land in the Pacific. The horrors were real and Mr. Eastwood does a fair job showing us some pretty abhorrent conditions the Japanese were subjected to. Clint Eastwood is a fine filmmaker, but he's not the finest. And this is also where I have a beef with the Oscar board members.<br /><br />This film is in a foreign language and yet it got nominated in the "Best Picture" category at last year's Oscars. I realize that the director is American, but that alone surely shouldn't dictate the category in which it's placed come awards time, should it? Almost all of the remaining awards ceremonies placed it in the "Foreign Language" category but not The Academy of Motion Picture Arts. A bit of cronyism going on? Banish the thought!</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>I was intrigued to watch this, as seeing a movie about the Battle of Iwo Jima from the Japanese perspective seemed promising.<br /><br />Alas!  I don't feel the director or the scriptwriter had any insights into that battle, into the the lives of their characters, or into the mind of the Japanese that anybody else doesn't.  It was all so stereotypical.<br /><br />Plus:  couldn't tell the characters apart, as they all look the same and Eastwood does nothing about this.  The guy who was taken from his wife?  I thought he died like 3 times!  Was he the guy with the shovel at the end?  (Before branding me a racist, bear in mind I had the same complaint about the companion movie, "Flags of Our Fathers.")</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>Relying on flash backs, personlized lines of dialogue and that murky, colorless look that seems the staple of dehuminizing war films, I was really uninterested in what was supposed to be a refreshing film of complete originality. The idea is, of course, new and as uncharted as some of the tunnels that still remain hidden on that island. Instead of a faceless enemy, we have an intimate movie about the enemy forces of World War II. showing in desperation their cultural clash with our own. The rare glimpse of their own terrors and ideas. The terrible realization that suicide is a last option embraced by commanders and public opinion at saving face. These all make for rare, and splendid movie making, and in no better hands than the genre charging Clint Eastwood, yet smothered by stories, perhaps heard once too many times, of the soldiers lives. I just could not be energized from my cold state in watching time after time another personlized attempt to force feed my embrace of the characters by cheesy sob stories of their past. It was too hollywood scripted. I was dissapointed to say the least. The battle scenes are so scarce and hidden in smoke and fog, that you feel on the outside of all the violence to a point of frustration. No matter what anyone impresses upon me about the milestones of this film, I will never see anything beyond my own boredom of this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>and it bored me to death by watching it. and there were lot of movies about the second world war, but this movie unfortunately carried the most boring and dead-beat storyline. while 'flag of our fathers' was full of hollow parties and big words, 'letters from iwo jima' was even worse, not just boring, but subtly insert a message to let you see how cruel and abusive the japanese high ranking officers were to their subordinate soldiers. there almost nothing worth to be seen in this hollow and boring movie. i just have to say that both the 'flag' and the 'letters' sucked big time. they were two of the worst movies in my viewing experience, and they didn't even deserve my time to write reviews, because it's simply dumb after i've already wasted almost over 5 hours sitting through them.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>This movie is arguably the best movie of 2006.  It's complete & comprehensive.  Who would have thought that Clint Eastwood betters himself every year in the craft of movie making? I have to say that "Letters from Iwo Jima" is sublime.  For audience who have watched the American side in "Flag of our Fathers", this offering is able to fill some holes in the first movie. Whilst the first movie is more intense in battle scenes, this second movie goes the other way.  It focuses more on intimate scenes of Japanese soldiers hiding in underground caves and trenches to conduct guerilla warfare similar to ones used by VietCong during Vietnam War writing letters to their loved ones.  Here, we could understand why the Japanese lost the battle even before it had begun.  Most Japanese officers were deeply entrenched in the belief of death before dishonour and they would opt for gungho showdown rather than conserving resources to fight via element of surprises. Watanabe Ken is fabulous as the worldly General who'd been ordered to lead the Japanese side when most of his officers were disagreeing and disobeying his orders anyhow.  He's protrayed as a humane General who would perform his duty with courage, dignity and integrity despite of his yearning to go home safely to his family.  As Japanese force was severely depleted, there weren't any reinforcement and resources left to complement his strategies to undermine the American side.  Compounded by mass suicide of his soldiers as ordered by mutinied officers, he's fighting a losing battle and he knew it.  Audience bonded with two reluctant soldiers, Saigo  who was originally a baker & was coerced to become a soldier when the numbers were running thin; Shimizu, an ex-Kempeitai (akin to German's much feared Gestapo) who was sent to Iwo Jima because he wasn't tough enough.  They were torn between responsibilities to their Emperor & their country versus their longing to return home safely to their families.  There, there's also Nishi, an Olympic horsejumper who in his heydays would host party for Mary Pickford & Douglas Fairbank and who would volunteer himself to serve his country and a humanist officer; Ito, an inflexible militant akin to Tojo Hideki who would order his troops to their deaths just to win the battle. Here, we witnessed Americans soldiers gunned down Japanese soldiers even though they surrendered themselves, Japanese officers killing their own kinds just because they opted not to fight anymore, how some captured American soldiers were treated humanely in captivity by Japanese and some would be bayonetted & tortured cruelly. Certain scenes were deeply disturbing such as suicides with grenades, flamethrowers that gobbled everything and everyone along their paths. This is where war raises its ugly head and the time when we contemplate and asking why there need to be war at the first place.  It's ironic having a war movie suggesting an anti-war message.  This monochrome movie concludes rightfully with sunrise in glowing orange suggesting that the worst's over and a better promise & hope for future generations.  As read in the book, Ken's character ended up committing hara-kiri whilst to make it poetic in this movie, he used a pistol to kill himself that's been gifted to him during his stay in America.  An unmissable experience and an unforgettable movie. It's very rare a movie would give me lumps in my throat and what a sight to witness to see so many teary faces and people being contemplative in the cinema as end credit rolls.  Keep up the good work, Clint!</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>It is quite amazing how a director as classically American as Clint Eastwood can make such an emotionally audacious film about the Japanese defense of Iwo Jima during the last year of WWII and manage to do it purely from the Japanese perspective. The idea of showing the adversarial side of the war is not new (1970's "Tora! Tora! Tora!" comes to mind), but what makes Eastwood's historical epic unique is the intense infusion of humanism that courses through the story and the lack of personal judgment on the suicidal Japanese military strategy at the time. There are neither heroes nor villains on either side. The result is an empathic study of a group of men caught in an inevitably fatalistic situation. Leading the effort is Lt. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, an honorable, aristocratic man who has a biding respect for Americans based on his travels there during the late 1920's. With neither air nor naval support forthcoming, Kuribayashi concludes that his troops will need to fight to the death.<br /><br />The central figure among the soldiers is an obstreperous young private named Saigo, who has left a wife and infant daughter back home. Along with the rest of his troop, he spends weeks excavating tunnels and trenches on the higher grounds of the island. The scope of the incoming U.S. fleet exceeds their worst fears, and the rest of the film focuses on how they face the depletion of ammunitions and rations while realizing defeat and death are at hand. We see brief flashbacks of defining moments in their lives back home, just enough to give their reasons for being there but not to the point where we get fully realized characters. I believe this was an intentional move by the filmmakers to focus on the more immediate emotional responses to sacrificing themselves for a greater good, which comes down to buying more time for the empire to win the overall war.<br /><br />Similar to "Saving Private Ryan", the film is dramatically shot by Tom Stern in desaturated, monochromatic tones that give it a black-and-white, documentary-like feel with the bomb explosions primarily in vivid color. The cast is headed by the only recognizable actor to American audiences, the charismatic Ken Watanabe, who effectively plays Kuribayashi with economic authority. As Saigo, J-Pop star Kazunari Ninomiya really holds the film together through his character's serendipitous circumstances, while effective turns are provided by Tsuyoshi Ihara as the erudite Baron Nishi (the former Olympic equestrian champion); Shido Nakamura as the belligerent and increasingly desperate Lt. Ito; Ryo Kase as the stoically vulnerable Shimizu; and Yuki Matsuzaki as Saigo's smiling comrade Nozaki.<br /><br />Japanese American writer Iris Yamashita penned the forceful screenplay based on a story by her and Paul Haggis based on a published book of the picture letters Kuribayashi sent to his family and depicted in the film. While the technical aspects of this historical reenactment are superlative, not to mention the fact that the linguistic barriers between the Japanese cast and American crew must have been daunting, this masterful work really shows how the autumnal Eastwood knows like no other director how to convey the gravitas of impending death without sacrificing the propulsive drama and human heart at the core of the story. Be forewarned that some scenes are invariably graphic and that a few of the subtitles have been obscured by the intermittent use of a white background.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Definitely a GREAT movie, Letters from Iwo Jima is Clint Eastwood's companion film to Flags of our Fathers and examines the Battle of Iwo Jima from the point of view of the Japanese.  General Tadamichi Kuribayashi arrives on Iwo Jima to see to the island's defenses prior to the American attack that is to follow.  While there, he will come across a wide spectrum of Japanese soldiers who are about to put their lives on the line for the defense of their families, their homeland, and their emperor.<br />Ken Watanabe and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% making this movie one of the best of its kind.  The actors' great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing a film that can be watched over and over again.<br />Balanced and fair, Letters from Iwo Jima is a movie about duty, honor, bravery, loyalty, inner strength, and the defeated side's heroes from a time long gone.<br />The battles, the costumes, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!<br />In conclusion, Letters from Iwo Jima is a film guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection as it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"Every jackass thinks he knows what war is.  Especially those who've never been in one.  We like things nice and simple, good and evil, heroes and villains.  There's always plenty of both.  Most of the time, they are not who we think they are."<br /><br />Those words are actually from the beginning of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O77QDI">"Flags of Our Fathers"</a> the first of two films from Clint Eastwood dealing with the battle for Iwo Jim during World War II.  That film was about the story behind the photograph of the flag raising at Iwo Jim and what happened to the men in that famous shot (probably the most reproduced photograph in history).  But the sentiments apply as well to "Letters from Iwo Jim," which tells the story from the perspective of the island's Japanese defenders.  The battle lasted from February 19, 1945 until March 26, 1945 and of the 22,000 Japanese troops entrenched on Iwo Jim, only 1,083 survived, with only 216 of that number being captured.  Allied forces suffered 26,000 casualties, with nearly 7,000 dead in the only large engagement of World War II against the Japanese in which the Allied forces suffered more casualties.  So we watch this 2006 film knowing that the Japanese are going to lose and that none of its characters may be alive by the time the credits roll.<br /><br />"Letters" begins with Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) arriving on Iwo Jim with orders to defend it to the last man.  Kuribayashi decision to build bunkers and caves rather than trenches on the beaches is viewed with skepticism by his subordinates, but would prove effective in holding the 5 mile by 2 mile island for over a month against an Allied force four times as large despite having neither naval nor air support.  In other words for the Japanese the Battle of Iwo Jim is like Thermopylae or the Alamo, except that losing the battle is not a prelude to winning the war.  The title of the film comes from letters being written home by the Japanese on the island, from the commanding general to the young baker named Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya), who had to leave his pregnant wife to become a solider.  It is Saigo who is clearly the character with whom our sympathies lay because he is one of the few who really wants to be alive when the fighting is over.<br /><br />Both Kuribayshi and Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara) challenge the stereotypical view of Japanese officers established in all those old World War II movies.  Kuribayshi studied with American officers in the United States and Nishi won a silver medal in horse jumping at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics, so they have a respect for the Americans and an understanding that it is inevitable Japan will lose both this island and the war.  This contrasts sharply with those who yell about death before dishonor, but what stands out most is not the divisive rhetoric but the common human experience.  Nothing in the film humanizes the Japanese soldiers more than the thousand-stitch belts they wear, made by their mothers for them to wear into battle for good luck, and the irony that the most touching letter in the film is one sent to an American soldier by his mother is not lost on us.<br /><br />To say that "Letters from Iwo Jim" is an anti-war film is not particularly insightful because these days you would be hard pressed to find a pro-war film.  As the opening sequences of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00001ZWUS">"Saving Private Ryan"</a> amply demonstrated, any realistic depiction of a war is going to convince most people they never want to be in one.  But that takes away nothing from those who have gone to war and done their duty.  It is impossible not to see these two films by Eastwood without thinking about the war in Iraq and it is very disquieting to be thinking that blowing yourself up with a grenade makes a suicide bomber look good.  Kuribayahsi had ordered his men to each kill 10 Americans before they die, so how the suicides of these Japanese soldiers conforms to the dictates of honor is incomprehensible.  Then there is the irony of one biggest proponents of honor and suicide being found in a hole just like Saddam Hussein.  In war heroism, cowardice, stupidity, propaganda, death, and so many other things are clearly eternal.<br /><br />I watched "Flag of Our Fathers" again to see to what extent the two films overlap, but there is nothing that stands out (I read that the American with the flame thrower is the only actor to appear in both).  Basically what the two films have in common is the setting of that rock in the Pacific, with its black sand beach (the film's original title was "Red Sun, Black Sand").  In "Letters" the flag atop Mount Suribachi is a small but significant object seen from the other side of the island by Kuribayashi.  My preference is for "Letters" over "Flag," in part because I am less familiar with that side of the story, having seen "The Outsider," the sobering 1961 film starring Tony Curtis as Ira Hayes, but also because almost all of "Letters" takes place on Iwo Jima and is more about soldiers fighting and dying.  Of course both films look at what the soldiers on both sides were fighting and dying for, which is why you have to make a point of seeing both films.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Director Clint Eastwood has followed up his highly successful "Flags of our Fathers" with a film that looks at the Battle of Iwo Jima entirely from the Japanese perspective.  In that vein, "Letters From Iwo Jima" gives the viewer an entirely new look at the battle, and perhaps a new perspective of the Japanese soldiers who were defending the island.<br /><br />Ken Watanabe stars as General Tadamichi Kuribayashi.  He was put in charge of formulating a defense of Iwo Jima.  Kuribayashi was not the typical Japanese General.  He worried greatly about the well-being of his family and the men under his command.  He refused to eat special rations; rather, he insisted on eating the same food as the soldiers.  He routinely made inspections on foot rather than from a vehicle.  And, perhaps most importantly, he didn't abide by the Japanese bushido code.  Upon taking command, he set about re-formulating Iwo's defenses from a beachhead defense to a complex system of tunnels and caves.  These would prove most difficult for the Americans to break.<br /><br />Kazunasi Ninomiya stars as Saigo, a young Japanese soldier who is part of Iwo's garrison.  He was told at his home that he was drafted into the army.  This news greatly disturbed his wife, who was pregnant at the time of Saigo's induction.  He worked as a baker before being drafted, and he had several run-ins with the Japanese secret police.  Now, realizing that the war is hopelessly lost, he longs to be back with his family.<br /><br />As the movie goes along, the American invasion draws nearer.  The Japanese fortifications are strong, and on D-Day, the Americans suffer many casualties due to Kuribayashi's defenses.  However, it is soon clear to the Japanese that the battle cannot be won.  Many men commit suicued by blowing themselves up with grenades rather than surrender.  Saigo and another Japanese soldier even decide to surrender rather than commit suicide or die of starvation, but the attempt is foiled.  Saigo's friend manages to surrender, but Saigo is caught and taken back to his unit.  His friend is eventually shot by two American soldiers who don't want to watch over him.<br /><br />In the end, Kuribayashi leads an attack against the American positions, only to be severely injured by shrapnel.  As he lay dying, he pulls out his pearl-handled pistol, a gift from friends in the United States, and shoots himself.  Saigo, who was told by Kuribayashi to bury him, is eventually captured by the Americans, but he ended up surviving the battle.<br /><br />This is a fantastic movie.  Clint Eastwood has went a step beyond "Flags" with this movie.  Although I liked "Flags" very much, I enjoyed "Letters" more.  Ken Watanabe delivers an Oscar-caliber performance as Kuribayashi, while Ninomiya's portrayal of Saigo is just as good.  The battle scenes are very realistic, and it is sobering to see that many of the Japanese soldiers were not evil killing machines; on the contrary, they were very much like the Americans; scared and missing their homes and loved ones.<br /><br />I give this film my highest recommendation.  Clint Eastwood has crafted a masterpiece that is sure to become a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>Letters from Iwo Jima was an after thought of Clint Eastwood after he had read some of the letters written by Japanese soldiers.  Letters was budgeted at 20 million while Flags of Our Fathers had a 90 million budget.  Viewing both films gives us a full picture of a cataclysmic battle that from our perspective of sixty years seems a terrible waste of life.<br /><br />The film provides perspectives from that on an enlisted man (Saigo, a baker played by Kazunari Ninomiya) and General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (played by Ken Watanabe) through their actions on the island and flashbacks.  So, we learn that General Kuribayashi, a career soldier in the cavalry, lived for a time in the United States where he received as a gift a Colt revolver from his American hosts and that Saigo was drafted after his baking equipment was confiscated to be used in the war effort.  The film begins with the arrival of General Kuribayashi on Iwo Jima and chronicles the hard life of the defenders plagued with dysentery, poor rations and the heat.  Kuribayashi takes up what his officers feel is a poor defense of the island by digging tunnels and not creating trenches on the beach.  The one ally Kuribayashi has among his officers is Baron Nishi, a pragmatic man who had been in the equestrian events in the 1932 Olympics held in Los Angeles and makes his first appearance riding a horse.  There is a feeling of doom over the garrison as little by little they receive mounting bad new: the destruction of what remains of the Japanese fleet, that no additional tanks can be sent and that no reinforcements can be expected.<br /><br />Kuribayashi maintains a positive front that the battle can be won but everyone in the Japanese garrison can sense immanent defeat. As with Flags of Our Fathers, the battle scenes where filmed showing the ferocity of the fighting and the suicides of many of the Japanese soldiers.  There is a scene where a Japanese commander ignores the order of Kuribayashi to withdraw and orders his men, one of whom is Saigo, to commit suicide, which they do with hand grenades (tying in to a scene from Fathers).  Several of the soldiers are clearly reluctant to kill themselves but only Saigo and another soldier are left alive.<br /><br />In a film filled with memorable performances two stand out. Ken Watanabe gives a magnificent performance as General Kuribayashi given him a heroic but vulnerable character as he draws sketches of happier past events.  At one point, it appears that the waste of lives almost convinces him that he should surrender but then a broadcast from his home town if Japan by a group of children imploring him to defend them changes his mind.  Kazunari Ninomiya as Saigo is excellent as a reluctant soldier who is doing his duty but would rather surrender that be killed or commit suicide.  Kuribayashi and Saigo are at opposite ends; one heroic and the other pragmatic but the two interact several times in the film and Kuribayashi is instrumental in saving Saigo.<br /><br />The film is beautifully photographed using mono-chromatic colors that give it a feel of old photographs.  Like Flags of Our Fathers, Letters from Iwo Jim tells an unvarnished story about the horrors of war; the difference with Letters is that the cause is lost and the heroism is tinged with desperation.  I highly recommend seeing both Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima.  Together they present an unforgettable story of a battle that marked the beginning of the end of the war in the Pacific.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Well done but very graphically (and necessarily so) violent film by Clint Eastwood, telling us the story of the battle for this island during WW2---from the Japanese p.o.v.<br /><br />The title refers to the letters these soldiers received, or tried to send.  In this sense, they are the same as the soldiers coming to attack them.  Eastwood, to his credit, does not try to push your buttons in regard to the Japanese men on the island.  Internal conflicts abound among the soldiers, who have differing opinions of honor, duty, and dying for one's country.  You can't help but feel some sympathy for these fellows, who spend their last days with no food, water, or ammo.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood's epic "Letters from Iwo Jima", an emotional documentary style tribute to the Japanese defenders of Iwo Jima should be viewed as a snapshot into a horrific, dehumanizing episode of history rather than for purely entertainment value.<br /><br />Eastwood portrays the battle through the eyes of commanding General Kuribayashi played by Ken Watanabe and a pair of conscripts humble former baker Saigo played by Kazunari Ninomura and disgraced military academy cadet Shimizu played by Ryo Kase.  Using bleached almost colorized black and white cinematography which enhanced the representation of the bleak terrain,  Eastwood mixes dialogue with excerpts from letters unearthed from Japanese soldiers years later to tell the tale.<br /><br />Watanabe arrives on the island ordered to defend it as a strategic and essential buffer to homeland security, at all costs.  The organized and compassionate general quickly alters the slipshod preparation already made for the upcoming invasion gaining the respect of his men.  Digging a series of honeycombed caves in the volcanic rock, the soldiers hole up and await their fate.  Watanabe soon however learns of a series of devastating military defeats which dooms the ability to reinforce Iwo Jima.  He conveys the suicide nature of their defense to the defenders and what plays out is a touching depiction of how the men deal with their tragic situation.<br /><br />Amid a dizzying display of brutal combat and intense psychological turmoil, we gain empathy for the Japanese ordered to fight to the death.  With the revelation through their letters that their thoughts and feelings are identical to their American enemies, Eastwood gives us a previously unconsidered respect for the condemned Japanese troops.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>Finally saw this film, and was blown away. I'm not averse to sub-titles, and  the simple screenplay gets the point across. It's always healthy to get a different viewpoint, and understanding the futility of the Japanese faction was very well displayed. No one is spared; the Japs and Americans alike were guilty of brutality. There have been other films that have presented war from the other side ("The Bridge", Germany, 1960, and "Ballad of a Soldier", USSR, 1961, and others I'm sure...), but by virtue of Mr. Eastwood's participation, this is a very American film. It's good to know that a smart American has made a film to show the passion, heartaches and love that is left behind in time of war without issue.The acting is outstanding. Ken Watanabe is the most well-known and has garnered the most attention, but there are fine performances from Tsuyoshi Ihara (as Nishi, the former Olympian), and especially Kazunari Ninomiya as Saigo, the real star. He is wonderful, and covers every corner of every emotion. The single-disc DVD has absolutely NO extras, and I was disappointed.It is a fine, thoughtful anti-war film that is worthy of everyone's attention...if you take the time to absorb. Previous reviewers were bored, but the film demands attention; giving it that attention will give you a very fine film experience. Just another big feather in Mr. Eastwood's cap.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>This American film presents the battle for Iwo Jima from the perspective of the outnumbered Japanese soldiers who were stationed there.  Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya), a baker with a wife and a daughter he has never met, is not seduced by the nationalistic fervor that prefers death to defeat.  He wants to go home to his family.  The new commander on the island, Gen. Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe), who has lived in the United States and cherishes a pistol that was a going-away gift from his American friends, is resolved to fight for his homeland.  Watanabe projects the weary determination of a man fated to play his part in a conflict that he personally feels is a historical tragedy.<br /><br />Director Clint Eastwood has made a remarkable film that affirms common humanity across temporary divisions of national self-interest.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>The second half of Clint Eastwood's two-film look at the Battle of Iwo Jima (Following last October's "Flags of our Fathers,"), "Letters from Iwo Jima" is an emotional, fascinating look at the battle from the perspective of the Japanese soldiers. In this film, Eastwood shows the Japanese mentality during the war, but also shows that some were uncomfortable with it. For me, it shows that, when you strip all politics and ideologies away from war, all true soldiers fight for the same reasons: for their country and those they love.<br /><br />The movie follows the actions of two key players. Oscar-nominee Ken Watanabe ("The Last Samurai") gives a great performance as General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, the man given the responsibility of commanding the garrison on the island of Iwo Jima. Here, we see a man who knows that fighting against the United States is a no-win situation, but will still defend the island for his country. Kazunari Ninomiya gives a fine performance as Saigo, one of the common soldiers in the Japanese army. His character is complex: one who didn't want to fight, but was conscripted to join the army, leaving his wife and child behind, and Ninomiya pulls of the part splendidly. The rest of the cast give great performances as well.<br /><br />While the film does move a bit slow at times, the great performances, fine storytelling, and exciting battle sequences more than make up for the film's slower passages. Overall, I say that "Letters from Iwo Jima" is a better film than "Flags of our Fathers," giving us a look at those we fought against in a kind, somber manner. I recommend this film to both historians and war-film afficinados.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A38I00SO3D9ZSM.html">A38I00SO3D9ZSM</a><br/><p>Letters from Iwo Jima is well scripted and acted. Ken Watanabe and Kazunari Ninomiya were fantastic.<br /><br />While perhaps not popular with people of the WWII generation, the strength of thi film is that it shows the battle for the island from the Japanese point of view. The film humanizes the Japanese without engaging in revisionism or political correctness. In it we see the "enemy" as men with wives, children, many of whom would rather not be fighting, but who love their country and cherish their "honor." Letters doesn't attempt to justify the Japanese position during the war.  Rather, it reminds us that, on an individual level, the Japanese were probably not much different than their American enemies (at least in terms of their hopes, dreams, aspirations, etc.)<br /><br />The cast seemed sparse, giving it something of a low budget feel.  It was filmed through very dark lenses, or so it would appear. It's a color film that has so little color that it looks as if it were shot in B&W. Contrast that with Flags of Our Fathers, which was very colorful and bright.<br /><br />There are several shots of American airplanes and what appears to be the entire Pacific fleet approaching the island. The panoramic shots of the approaching US fire power, is almost breathtaking, certainly awe-inspiring.<br /><br />Comparisons to its brother film, Flags of our Fathers, are unavoidable.  In virtually all categories or measures, Letters is the better of the two films.  If you liked Flags, you'll really like Letters.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>It is a treat to have Clint Eastwood deliver his latest piece of work.  "Letters of Iwo Jima" is shot in black and white and it is one of the finest war movies since "Schindler's List" that was made in the same style.  It is also a foreign movie, shot entirely in Japanese language. This is a story of WWII in Pacific, made entirely from the Japanese soldier's point of view.  These soldiers are just like any other.  They are dedicated to their country, their duty to their emperor and honor towards their fellow countrymen.  They are lonely, concerned about their families and their future.  Human nature and character trancends any morality tales.  Eastwood is not lecturing us here.  He is just showing us that no matter where people come from some are noble, some are not; some are decent and some are not.  However, Eastwood manages to make them feel human, strong and vulnerable at the same time. An absolute gem - must see movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A25QJBK33C4O0R.html">A25QJBK33C4O0R</a><br/><p>As the title implies, many words can be used to describe this movie, including slow (not in a bad way at all), deliberate (in a very good way), contemplative, and more.  Fantastic and fascinating also.<br /><br />Letters from Iwo Jima gives those that watch the film the view from the other side of the battle at Iwo Jima, the side that most U.S. citizens (and other persons not of Asian descent) would likely not be aware of.  Clint Eastwood did this film as a companion piece to his much lauded film Flags of Our Fathers.  Flags is a look at the heroes of Iwo Jima.  I won't go into details about that film other than to say once you've seen it you realize that looking at Flags as a film about heroes is not what you wind up left with at the end.  Watch that film and you'll know what I'm referring to.<br /><br />Flags was a telling of the U.S. and Allied side of the events that happened on Iwo Jima, but also much more, including a good long look at the lives of the people that were fighters at Iwo Jima once those people had returned to the U.S. mainland.  While Flags doesn't demonize the Japanese military that was fighting the U.S. and allied forces at Iwo, it doesn't give any real details into the experiences of the other side.<br /><br />Letters gives us a long look into the Japanese military personnnel that served at Iwo Jima.  We get to see how they prepared for the inevitable battle, and how the people on the island faced a destiny they weren't necessarily happy to have to meet.  While many U.S. citizens may think of the Japanese soldiers in terms of willing to fight to the death and gladly lay down their lives in honor of their emperor, the soldiers that served at Iwo were not necessarily people that wanted to do that.  They had family to think of, had home lives they longed to return to, and had been left with little resources and logistical support as they became the last line of defense against U.S. Naval power on the way to the Japanese homeland.<br /><br />As another reviewer notes in their comments, the vast majority of the dialogue for the soundtrack for this film is in Japanese.  Viewers will most likely be watching this film with subtitles on constantly, with those subtitles in U.S. English translating the dialogue and providing the story for those viewers to understand (without having to learn Japanese first ;-) )  Unlike the reviewer that complained about the pacing of the subtitles, I had no issue with how long they were shown on the screen as the conversations flowed.  There was plenty of time to read the subtitle and also take in the images that were shown, and the subtitles weren't distracting for me at all.<br /><br />Though this film is a companion to Flags of Our Fathers, personally I believe this is the better film, and I would note that you really don't need to see either film in order to enjoy or appreciate the other.  Further, I would have to say that perhaps using the word 'enjoy' here is not quite appropriate.  Letters isn't a film that will bring joy for most viewers.  It's not a depressing film, but it's also not an uplifting film.  It documents, in a documentarian style, the events that happened at Iwo Jima, mostly from the Japanese side, and does so without glorifying or villifying war and it's participants.<br /><br />Letters is, in my opinion, a master work and is well worth owning for me.  While it may not be a film that viewers would want to see more than once or twice, it most certainly should be viewed at least once, and somewhat savored for the fine film that it is.<br /><br />One last comment here, relating to the film style used.  If you watch the film on HD DVD (or perhaps Blu-ray) you may feel somewhat offput by the grainy feel of the image used in many places on the film.  That look is intentional and really seems appropriate (to me) for this film.  That look may bother some, but I think it works well as it's used here.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>Its not often that Hollywood makes a movie about soldiers experiencing a defeat.  Even more rare is a movie about enemy soldiers being defeated by the home forces; American soldiers.  Amazingly, it took Clint Eastwood to make such a movie.  Released late in 2006 as a companion of the other Eastwood movie, Flags of our Fathers, this is one of the best war movies this decade.  Set entirely on the island of Iwo Jima, it examines the defense and conquest of this island by the US military in 1944 as seen from the eyes of the Japanese defenders.  The Japanese soldiers are played by Japanese actors; which is exemplary, and their on-screen dialogue is Japanese, another plus of authenticity.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>In this sequel to his earlier film Flags of Our Fathers (although you can watch either film first), director Clint Eastwood tells the story of that famous battle from the perspective of our enemy and the losers, the Japanese soldiers. Japan's 22,000 soldiers fought bravely for forty days against an American invasion of 70,000 troops; only 2,000 Japanese survived the carnage. The film does a remarkable job of helping us to view our ostensible "enemies" as fellow human beings; in almost every respect the combatants are mirror images of each other. They complain about army food, make crude jokes about women, see through the lies that their own government feeds them, fight bravely despite being horribly under-resourced, cuss at broken equipment, make the best of a dehumanizing task, and receive and write letters to their loved ones back home. When a Japanese soldier reads a letter that he took from a dead American he remarks, "I was taught to believe that the Americans were cowards and savages, but when I read this letter from the soldier's mother I realize that he is just like me." In Japanese with English sub-titles.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>This, together with "Flags", tries to capture the war experience of two civilizations that rarely overlapped. Except in the basic humanity of most of the indiviual soldiers in the midst of the madness. Well done.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>It was a brave move by Eastwood to make not one but two movies about Iwo Jima, and braver still to show the pivotal conflict from each sides point of view.  Where Flags of Our Fathers was flawed in its approach, muting the impact, `Letters..' is more perfectly formed, and arguably more complex in nature - and it's a success.<br />Through sepia, almost colourless photography, we see the defence of Iwo Jima from the viewpoint of several Japanese soldiers.  We see them, and we hear them in the forms of their letters they write home, letters that they know may never reach their intended recipients. From this simple framework, we see the build up of defences as the new commanding officer arrives (Ken Watanabe, brilliant) and also from the viewpoint of the soldiers filling sandbags, through to the invasion of the hordes of Americans, and through to the final death throes of the last vestiges of defence.<br />The range of characters (working class disillusioned solider, aristocratic gentleman officer, honourable commanding officer sworn to his duty but grieved with it) is wider than we might expect, and makes the anti-war message very clear - we are all the same.  Previous war movies have shown one man from the other side to be more complex or sympathetic to us, but here we see the whole Japanese cross section of society, and it presents us with a picture on one hand of a society different from ours, and yet so similar in the humanity of it.  Even in one sub-section - the officers for example, a complex range of views, opinions and impact is observed. One of the key moments comes in the capture of an American soldier, and how even if some of the soldiers can not separate the propaganda from what they see, the words of his mother in a letter are so universal maternal, that they can not help but see what is common between them is greater than that which is different.<br />It feels like quite a long movie, and the pace is stately in an almost Japanese style which may put some off, however this pushes the movie beyond some flash bang war movie to satisfy the bloodthirsty, and creates that difficult thing - a movie about the war, showing the war, yet a firm indictment of the effects of war.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>****1/2<br /><br />If the closing credits didn't identify Clint Eastwood as the director of "Letters from Iwo Jima" you might be forgiven for believing you were watching an actual Japanese war film like "Burmese Harp" or "Fires on the Plain" - not merely because the dialogue is in Japanese with English subtitles but because the movie has a starkness of vision and an intimacy of scope uncharacteristic of mainstream American movie-making. This is Eastwood's flip-side companion piece to the earlier "Flags of Our Fathers," which told the story of the Battle of Iwo Jima from the American point of view. For this film, Eastwood has shrunk his canvas considerably, populating it with fewer familiar faces and restricting the action almost entirely to the island itself. Indeed, it is this very air of claustrophobia that makes "Letters from Iwo Jima" a more cohesive, personal and meaningful work than the earlier fine film.<br /><br />As the movie begins, the Japanese army is preparing for an American assault on the island. The film focuses on two main characters, one from the upper echelons of the military and one from the grunt class. The former is Tadamichi Kuribayashi, a Lieutenant General who is sent to the site to take command of the forces for the battle to come. Kuribayashi is a compassionate pragmatist who has to deal not only with the enemy battering away at the island with the relentless fury of heavy artillery but the suicidal tendencies of his own men, many of whom subscribe to the belief that it is more honorable to commit hara-kiri than to endure the ignominy of defeat or surrender. The common soldier's eye view is provided by Saigo, a private reluctantly drafted into the army, who would much rather be back at home with his wife and baby daughter than digging trenches on some godforsaken rock in the middle of nowhere, and who feels less eager than his compatriots to sacrifice his life in service of his country.<br /><br />By limiting their scope, Eastwood and screenwriter Iris Yamashita - working from the actual letters Kuribayashi and others sent home from the island - show us the horrors of war on a more personal scale than we generally find in films of this type. We come to identify with the desperation felt by 20,000 soldiers trying to fend off a force of 100,000 without benefit of naval or air support, virtually assured that none of them would ever make it off the island alive. The superb actor Ken Watanabe invests Kuribayashi with a confidence and compassion that makes us understand why the men under his command respect and follow him, and Kazunari Ninomiya perfectly embodies the contradictory nature of the everyman soldier. Torn between duty to self and duty to country, Saigo does what is asked of him yet evinces a much stronger commitment to self-preservation than do many of his buddies who seem all too eager to fall on the sword (or, the modern equivalent, a grenade) to avoid humiliation at the hands of the enemy. Ninomiya, with his openhearted demeanor and impish expression of boyish innocence, provides the emotional center the film needs to connect with the audience.<br /><br />As with "Flags of Our Fathers," cinematographer Tom Stern has bled so much of the color out of the picture that we seem almost to be watching a black-and-white movie, a technique that greatly enhances the bleakness of both the setting and the situation.<br /><br />"Letters from Iwo Jima" is not a film designed to appeal to the yahoos in the audience; it is, rather, a stripped-down, thoughtful and artful consideration of the horrors of war as seen through the eyes of "the enemy."</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>Remember all those war in the Pacific movies, with our men charging ashore? This is the flip side. The defenders are the Japanese. Recently, letters from those defenders of Iwo Jima in World War II were unearthed in a cave, unmailed. Then the movie flashes back to the war. The letters home furnish much of the story. Ordinary Japanese conscripts are  stationed on this god-forsaken island. This is a sympathetic movie about them. They know the Americans are coming. They have to. They don't know when. They hope reenforcements are coming. But they also know they are going go die. Hopefully they will do so with honor. In so many ways they are just guys like our men with their petty gripes about the food, the waiting around, their fool superior officers etc. American soldiers want to live but many will die. Japanese choose death over defeat & that is the big difference. I felt for their plight as many did kill themselves during the battle. However, there was a glimmer of hope. Several of their officers had been to America before the war. Their exposure to our culture convinced them there might be another way. An extraordinarily good World War II movie & kudos to the fine performances & direction of Clint Eastwood & his associates.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood's anti-war masterpiece belongs in the same company as "All Quiet on the Western Front," "Grand Illusion" and "Paths of Glory." The veteran filmmaker endured the lackluster "Flags of Our Fathers" in order to create this stark, intimate study of the Iwo Jima conflict from a Japanese perspective. Abetted by a revelatory cast and Tom Stern's brilliant cinematography, Eastwood's direction evokes a haunting power exceedingly rare in today's cinema. "Letters From Iwo Jima" transcends its genre as a truly unique and humanistic work.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>Letters from Iwo Jima is an exceptional film. It covers a 40 day period prior to the invasion of US troops on Iwa Jima and the events that occur immediately after. Filmed in sepia tones that are highlighted for fiery explosions, the limited color range made the action more terrible and the drama more heightened.<br /><br />Two officers lead the Japanese men on Iwo Jima, General Kuribayashi and Baron Nishi. The General is played to perfection by Ken Watanabe and the Baron is played with great zeal by Tshuyoshi Ihara. These two men are very worldly and sophisticated, both having lived in the USA. Whereas they are totally loyal to the Emperor and the cult of militarism that dominated Japan during World War II, they also are keenly aware that the Americans are not cowards and fools and that the fight for Iwa Jima will be a living hell. General Kuribayashi takes over command from Admiral Ohsugi, a conservative by-the-book mediocre military man. When General Kuribayashi's assessments are contrary to Admiral Ohsugi's we begin to see professional jealousies arise, ending with the Admiral leaving the island. General Kuribayashi found a situation where he was originally thought he had bombers and ships only to find he really had none. The island had very little fresh water, an insignificant amount in regard to the needs of a military campaign.<br /><br />The middle ranking officers were certainly interesting in the film. Many of them regarded General Kuribayashi and Baron Nishi as American sympathizers and in some cases disobeyed orders.  However these same fellows were also inclined to shot or behead the front line soldiers under their command when they thought that their orders were ignored or undermined or when they suspected retreat. There were repeated examples of how devotion to military authoritarianism combined with draconian rule enforcement is a dangerous combination for small minds.<br /><br />The front line soldiers were certainly sympathetic and were the heart of the movie. Kazunari Ninomiya played the baker Saigo perfectly.  He is the everyman figure, the lone survivor, the common man that survives despite all the odds against him. The film follows his 40 days as he sees a close friend die of bloody dysentery, as he runs from pillar to post avoiding death as the American's gradually overtake the entire island. He is joined by a young man that he first thinks is a spy for the secret police only to find later that this man has been disgraced for failure to follow an idiotic order from a superior officer.<br /><br />The Japanese faced amazing odds. Over a 40 day period they suffered over 22,000 casualties until only 216 remained. The empire was crumbling and reinforcements and supplies never came. Hiroshi Wantanabe played the loyal Lieutenant Fujita, aide to the General, who had to repeatedly bear bad news to the General who was plotting how to make the best of an impossible situation.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood produced a highly entertaining film here. The film is thoughtful and intellectual as it opens our eyes to Japanese culture of the time and the influence on the soldiers and officers. The film also explored empathy as we see several scenes where a top officer, Baron Nishi, converse with a wounded American solder. The Japanese were humanized in the film. They were never made to appear innocent of wartime crimes committed in China and elsewhere. Rather, we were given a balanced vision and insight into the Japanese military culture that fanned the war and the broad range of men and ethics and intelligence levels that interacted in this military-social system. We may not understand fully the authoritarian dictatorial leadership social structure that was the Japanese military norm, but we can see its negative effects on common men with common sense who could not question authority due to rigid social norms.<br /><br />Overall this is a thoughtful and moving and artistic entertainment experience of a high order.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IE0P2JMWW0H7.html">A3IE0P2JMWW0H7</a><br/><p>Superb movie by Clint Eastwood; battle of Iwo Jima from Japanese perspective. Well told, well worth watching.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O77QD8">Flags of Our Fathers [Blu-ray</a>]</p></br><a href="../users/A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ.html">A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ</a><br/><p>This excellent film from director Clint Eastwood demonstrates again Mr Eastwood's brilliance as a film maker. My only small complaint is that the film seemed a bit too long. Even the subtitles didn't distract from the enjoyment of the story. Some commentators with a political agenda have pointed out a scene in LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA where Americans committed a war crime, as if director Eastwood was making a blanket statement against American troops. But not long before that scene, he shows the Japanese committing a war crime. If the use of flame throwers seems a bit extreme in an all-out war against a no-surrender enemy, think about the Bataan Death March. The movie also shows some Japanese officers as being cruel toward their own men, ready to execute them on the spot without a trial for minor offenses. This attitude toward human life is reflective of the general kind of Japanese leadership that led to massive atrocities in China and elsewhere during World War Two. To see the battle for Iwo Jimo from the persepective of the Japanese who fought there is probably quite a novel movie-going experience for most Americans. You see the American air force, fleet and soldiers as the detached, distant, near silent enemy from the point of view of the Japanese soldiers (roles very well-acted) and the Americans are quite ominous -- and deadly. If anything, LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA is a kind of reverse fan letter to the American boys who fought and died in the Pacific against a brutal and homicidally aggressive dictatorship that attempted to enslave millions of people.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>This is the second movie Clint Eastwood did about the "Battle of Iwo Jima".  The first was "Flags of Our Fathers" that told the story of the TWO flat raisings atop Suribachi, the famous photograph, and the bond drive the funded the latter stages of the war, but at a great cost to the men pulled into that PR engine.  They became casualties of the war as much as those killed or wounded in the battle itself.<br /><br />Here, we see the battle from the perspective of the Japanese who were sent to defend that island and thereby delay the invasion of the Japanese Homeland.  They know the battle will be cataclysmic, but believe there will be reinforcements, naval support, and that they will be supplied with more planes.  When they learn none of this is true, they also realize they are being asked to fight until death.<br /><br />The conditions on the island are not very good.  The water is bad and is giving most of them dysentery.  The new general, Kuribayashi, rescinds the beach defense and wants them to tunnel out the mountain Suribachi.  He wants to prolong the battle as long as possible.  The hard line traditional officers don't like his approach and don't trust him because he has spent time in America and gotten to know American officers.  His one true supporter on the island is Baron Nishi, who won a gold medal in horse jumping at the Los Angeles Olympics in 1932.<br /><br />When the assault does come, the Japanese are stunned by the utter size of the invasion force.  Some fight, some commit suicide (against orders) so they can die with "honor", but almost all die.  In real life, of the 21,000 Japanese soldiers on the island, all but 216 died.  Among the American invasion force of 110,000, 8,226 died and 19,189 were wounded and almost 500 went missing.<br /><br />The movie uses a fictional character named Saigo, a baker conscripted into the war, to link the various elements of the battle together by his movements.  A very nice device.  It is this character who buries the letters of the title that are uncovered by modern day archaeologists digging in the caves and tunnels of Suribachi.<br /><br />Some have criticized the movie for making the "Americanized" Japanese officers the stars.  I have no opinion about that argument, but I really enjoyed the movie.  The fact that it is almost entirely in Japanese with subtitles didn't bother me in the least.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>To say that "Letters From Iwo Jima" is a great war film does it an injustice.  I found the film to be more of a tribute to humanity than a war picture.  It must have taken director Clint Eastwood a lot of courage, growing up under the specter of war, to make a film that humanizes the other side.  What Eastwood concerns himself here is the effects that the American assault on Iwo Jima had on the collective psyche of the Japanese fighting men.  These are men who were indoctrinated in a system that taught them the invincibility of Japan who under fire are finding their original assumptions eviscerated.  These are not the cliched Banzai shouting samurai sword wielding cartoon characters in the films of old.  These are bakers, shopkeepers, laborers, etc. who find themselves defending "sacred" Japanese soil while the powers-that-be divert prescious resources elsewhere.  There are any number of scenes here that will break your heart.  I approached this film with trepidition because I wasn't a big fan of Eastwood's other Iwo Jima epic, "Flags of our Fathers".  This film is infinitely better.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>A complimentary film to "Flags of Our Fathers", "Letters from Iwo Jima" uses many of the same techniques (including flashbacks during sequences where the soldiers are reading letters from loved ones or where they are thinking of events that occurred prior to their being stationed on the sparsely populated resource poor island) as that film but manages to touch on the personal much better than "Flags". Perhaps its Eastwood's perspective as an outsider to Japanese culture that made him more attuned as a director to these characters in "Letters" either way this film manages to get under the skins of the various characters much more successfully than "Flags" did. Although not as complex in terms of technique, "Letters" is every bit as complex emotionally as its companion piece. Perhaps the less complex storytelling structure allows Eastwood to dig a big deeper under the surface of these characters either way the two films when seen together are much richer than either one alone.<br /><br />Focusing much of its time on Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) a young reluctant recruit and the Japanese Commander Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) who must try and hold Iwo Jima with limited resources and no support from Japan, the film tells their desperate attempt to hold the island despite their bleak chances of success at fighting the massive American contingent arriving by sea and air. Eastwood manages to convey the fear, doubt and bravery of these soldiers as they tunnel into the mountainside of Iwo Jima taking an unconventional defense tactic which given the massive forces they face is the only chance that they have for success. Holding out for almost six weeks against superior fire and man power, Kuribayashi and his troops beat the odds putting up a heroic fight against a technological and resource superior adversary. Eastwood doesn't sugar coat the battle or the difficulties that both sides face in either film and doesn't glorify the cost of war. World War II may have been the last noble war that the United States was involved in but that doesn't make the cost of war noble or acceptable. There are always heroes on both sides of the battle regardless of whose ideology was right and on the field of battle there isn't right or wrong--just a desperate attempt to fight for your own survival amid the larger concerns that exist outside a small island in the South Pacific Ocean.<br /><br />Like "Flags", "Letters" looks extremely good in its transfer to DVD. The muted color scheme and look of the film add to the vividness as well as sense of reality that is essential to recreate the world from 60 plus years ago. Audio brilliantly conveys the ambiance of the island and the heat of battle with well placed sound effects. A warning for those expecting another war film in English--this is presented (with the exception of a few scenes) in Japanese since that's what the soldiers spoke. The film is subtitled in English with Spanish and French subtitles available as well.<br /><br />Unlike "Flags", "Letters" appears as a "special edition" from the get-go. While we don't get a commentary track (Eastwood has shied away from doing a commentary track for years and its probably just as well since he's a man of few but well chosen words), we get a number of terrific extras on the second disc. "Red Sun, Black Sand: The Making of `Letters from Iwo Jima'" is a terrific documentary on the making of the film allowing Eastwood and his team to discuss what drove them to create this companion piece and the complex challenges of filming two very similar films from different perspectives back-to-back.<br /><br />"The Faces of War" presents the cast introducing and discussing the characters they play in the film. For me it was the second most interesting extra here since even though familiar with military history often do not see the individual faces of the "enemy". Since history is often written by the victory of any battle, these individuals who fought for their country with as much passion as the Allies did for theirs are often overlooked and forgotten.<br /><br />Perhaps Eastwood's two epics would have fared better at the Oscars if they had been presented theatrical as one epic film since the two require each other as counterpoints. Either way, the two together have much more impact than either alone although of the two I found "Letters" to be the more compelling piece simply because we saw a side we rarely see if films about World War II focusing on the enemy. Watching the two films back-to-back was an exhausting experience but ultimately more rewarding for me since they dovetail quite nicely in their examination of the personal cost of war on the people who actually fight it and don't glorify the horrors of war. Eastwood continues to show amazing growth and talent as a film director proving that director's careers don't necessarily have to burn brightly and fade away as many of our top talents have.<br /><br />I'd suggest the deluxe set which has an extra disc with a History Channel documentary and short from WWII.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P1XITE">Letters from Iwo Jima / Flags of Our Fathers (Five-Disc Commemorative Edition)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A9L6L5H9BPEBO.html">A9L6L5H9BPEBO</a><br/><p>This story will definitely bring reflection and challenge your beliefs if you grew up in the years after World War II where the common question among friends was, what did your dad do in the war? To us kids, the Germans were derisively called Krauts or Huns and the Japanese were Japs or Nips. It was a common frame of reference to look at your enemy as subhuman, as fanatical madmen that should be exterminated. Such thinking is essential to the fighting man who must kill and still be able to redeem his ego from the psychosis of guilt and nightmares.<br /><br />Director Clint Eastwood presents something very much absent from war movies past, the humanization of our former enemies. "Letters from Iwo Jima" brings the Japanese perspective of the lead-up to the invasion of that island and the invasion. It centers around three characters, Ken Watanabe portrays Tadamichi Kuribayashi, the commanding general of the island, Tsuyoshi Ihara plays a Japanese officer who was a gold medalist as an Olympic equestrian, and Kazunari Ninomiya who is Private Saigo, the most pathetic soldier and sympathetic character of all three, a young father-to-be who answers the knock on the door and is told "Congratulations, you have been selected for the army," in a similar manner as Americans received their draft summons with the telegram that began with "Greetings!" His wife is chastised for crying at the news, as she is told it is a great honor to be chosen to die for his country. In one of the more poignant scenes, he tells his child in the womb that he is the daddy and promises to return home and she the child grow up.<br /><br />The Japanese commander is an egalitarian leader who does not share the fanaticism of some of his officers. He doesn't believe in ritual suicide or senseless charges. His letters home, from Iwo Jima tell his story and we see flashbacks of his time in the United States where he learned the language and made bonds of friendship. His closest friend is the officer and medalist who shares the same view of war and what constitute honor.<br /><br />The plot is the deprivation that Japanese suffered leading up the invasion, the endless preparation that created 11 miles of tunnels on Mt. Suribachi with ever dwindling provisions and replenishment and reinforcement that would never arrive. Soldiers question their military and cultural traditions that challenge them to die, when all they want to do is live and return to their homes and loved ones. Their turmoil is constant and we see it from the general to the lowest private. It's the turmoil of duty vs. the will to live.<br /><br />The story ends with the a soldier burying the letters of his commander so they will not be found. The story begins with Japanese anthropologists unearthing the letters.<br /><br />The splendor of this movie is its simplicity. It shows a minimum of color to reflect the deprivations and despair of the defenders.  The music is also muted, never overpowering adding its subtle sounds to a powerful script and images. The acting is superb and thankfully, the Japanese sound Japanese.  Clint Eastwood proves once again that he is a director to be taken seriously as the viewer cannot help but feel empathy for those who were once our most brutal foe. Eastwood also brings a strong message that in the brutality of war, soldiers of any uniform do not fight for their country, or their flag, or emperor. They fight for their closest comrades, their families and themselves. They fight to stay alive and stay whole physically and emotionally. On the island of Iwo Jima, many on both sides would never find either.<br /><br />It is a forgotten honor to remember our veterans on Memorial Day, men and women who have given their lives or their souls for their society. This time I will also think about those I never would have included before, someone like General Kuribayashi, Olympic champion Baron Nishi, and Private Saigo.<br /><br />Watch this film, and maybe you will understand why.<br /><br />For veterans everywhere.</p></br><a href="../users/AGRR05FH945HR.html">AGRR05FH945HR</a><br/><p>"If we could read the secret history of our enemies, we should find in each man's life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm any hostility." (Longfellow)<br /><br />Eastwood's masterpiece certainly humanizes the WW II Japanese military in a way that few movies ever have. I would however suggest watching Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence (Oshima) for an insight into their appalling treatment of Allied prisoners of war, which cannot be ignored.<br /><br />An immensely talented Japanese cast, headed by the superb Watanabe and Ninomiya, bring these characters to life in a way that renders this an unforgettable movie.<br /><br />In a career filled with excellence, this to me is Eastwood's finest hour.<br /><br />Outstanding.</p></br></body></html>

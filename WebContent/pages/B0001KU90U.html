Director Edward Zwick who made the astounding "Glory" along with the fine film<br /><br />"Legends of Fall," makes another epic with powerful direction.<br />  Tom Cruise delivers a powerful performance as<br />captain nNathan Algren.  He was a hero during the Civil War, but he feels much shame for a horrible atrocity which he participated in which was a slaughter of Indian women and children.  He feels remorse for the Indians and much contempt in the general who he helped commit the act.  So he flees to Japan to train the Japanese army for 500 dollars a month.  During a beginning battle he is captured by a group of Samurai warriors.  Ken Watanabe is so compelling as the Samurai leader he nearly humiliates Cruise.  Cruise is so amazed by the teachings and beliefs of the Samurai he stays with them and fights for their cause.<br />  Being a $140 million epic, The Last Samurai truly does deliver.  The battle sequences are spectacular, some of the best since Mel Gibson's Braveheart.  The Last Samurai is rated R for Strong Violence and Battle Sequences.  The battles are not exceptionally bloody but include guns, bayonets, swords, arrows, spears and cannonfire.  They are made to be more intense than actually gory.<br />  The film has been nominated for 3 Golden Globes. Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor and Best Origianl Score are the nominees. It will probably receive a substantial amount of Academy Award nominations, we'll just have to wait and see.  All in all a fine film worth viewing in theatres and owning on Video or DVD.  For the Best Actor award, it will definetly be between Tom Cruise and Jude Law, in my opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>Warner Brothers can?t catch a decent break, can they? For the last three years, the studio has had a mixed year based on the performance and public reaction of their films with the missteps outshining the successes. 2003 continues that trend with the poor reception of films like Gods & Generals, Dreamcatcher, Alex & Emma, and Looney Tunes: Back in Action. But what makes this year all the more hurtful was the fact that studio was expected to have had a good year riding the Matrix sequels alone. After the mixed reaction Reloaded received in May, The Matrix Revolutions couldn?t compete like it was expected too and failed to even break the $170 million mark the original film set in 1999. So with those thoughts in mind, what good can Warner Brother executives find in this year? Oscar potential. The studio?s leading Oscar contender is Clint Eastwood?s Mystic River but recently The Last Samurai has emerged to be heading for Oscar gold as well. The film?s leading man, Tom Cruise, hopes this is true in order to redeem the failure of capturing a nomination last year with his role in the critically praise Minority Report. Whether Warner Brothers pushes more for this film or Eastwood?s picture depends on Samurai?s performance but what can be said is that this film will definitely be raising eye brows.<br /><br />The Last Samurai focuses on the journey of a man from the United States who is sent to Japan to help eradicate a rebellious force but learns more from his enemy then he ever imagined. Captain Woodrow Algren is no stranger to the field of battle. He has seen things that many can?t even imagine. Things that he would gladly like to forget if he could. In the time after the Civil War, Captain Algren takes to the bottle like many generals in the 1870?s America. With the Civil War now over, all that is left is the rebellious Indian tribes that have decreased in number rapidly and have been nearly suppressed. But the captain is surprised to be offered the position of training Japanese troops in destroying the last of the samurai warriors that have rebelled against the Emperor who has forced Western society on the nation of Japan. After he is captured by Katsumoto and his band of samurai warriors, Captain Algren learns that the rebel force is not as ?savage? as was once thought. Eventually he comes to find the true meaning of honor, necessity, and remembrance of where one comes from by joining Katsumoto in preserving the samurai way of life. The story of The Last Samurai has to be quite possibly one of the most thought provoking scripts of the year, even beyond the complex realm of the Matrix sequels earlier this year. The film successfully blends historical content from the post-Civil War events both in the United States and Japan with the exquisite traditions and philosophies of the ancient samurais. The Last Samurai is a positively rare sight in the modern age of big budgeted epic dramas that present dazzling special effects but fail to deliver insight into the human experience.<br /><br />Though only one member of the film?s cast can be easily recognizable to American movie-goers, it doesn?t really matter all that much as the level of true acting talent goes far beyond the means of one?s star-power. Tom Cruise gives in all honesty one of the best performances of his career, even more so then his critically acclaimed role in Steven Spielberg?s 2002 sci-fi drama, Minority Report. The amount of determination and vivid emotions Cruise brings to the role go far beyond the acting he has demonstrated in the past and showcases a true sense of maturity in the roles he has chosen and will choose in the future. Captain Woodrow Algren is a perfect presentation of the concept of the will to open one?s self to new culture and way of life despite all those who claim in can not be done. Ken Watanabe, who portrays the samurai lord Katsumoto, does a superb job with the material that is given to him and though some may note that he struggles with the English language presented in the script that is the point of the character. It?s a beautiful portrayal of a talented actor learning the language and the traditions of vastly different culture along the same lines as the character he plays in the film does. Though some may have complaints about the limited appearance Koyuki has as the widow wife Yaka, one must look beyond the amount of screen time her character has and concentrate rather on the substance of her material that does exist. Yaka?s conversation with Katsumoto in which she expresses disagreement over her care of Captain Algren demonstrates the prominent theme of the film, one of a battle raging between honoring the traditions of one?s ancestors yet at the same time maintaining a willingness to break free from those traditions and progress in the world.<br /><br />Overall, The Last Samurai is a rare theatrical treasure that not only successfully presents to the audience a well choreographed Bella-drama of breath taking action sequences and spectacular visuals but intellectuals statements that expresses the idea of expanding one?s mind to a world beyond their own realm. Despite containing an excessively long three hour time length, The Last Samurai does manage its time well although it is to say it does have its points where slow downs are less then warranted but these misgivings can be easily ignored. Many of the concepts that discussed within the framework of the film, namely necessity and ancestry, have already been presented in some degree in the two Matrix sequels earlier this year but Samurai manages to go beyond those films and express those same thoughts on far-less complex level. The way of the samurai is to stick to the traditions of their ancestors and not modernize the way their people have lived for hundreds, if not thousands, of years but as Katsumoto soon comes to realize, modernization, in one form or another, is inevitable in any society. Modernization can be integrated into an already existing culture but not to the extent that all traditions and practices once held by that society are lost forever. The intricate demonstration of certain philosophical practices within the film must be seen to be fully understood by anyone interested by the feature?s premise. The Last Samurai is without a doubt the best, if not the most surprising, film of the year, far exceeding even the extravagantly high expectations set by The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Though greatly overlooked at this year?s Academy Awards ceremony, those who witness this film?s brilliant achievements and take its message to heart will give this film a far greater honor then any Hollywood awards ceremony could ever give.</p></br><a href="../users/A17N23WXA7EAF.html">A17N23WXA7EAF</a><br/><p>"The Last Samurai" is a breathtaking, historical, panorama that examines the blending of cultures and the clash of competing value systems. In this film, Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren a twelve year old boy who has moved from New Jersey to the California Coast with his single mom. While adjusting to his new environment, Algren practices Bushido (the way of the warrior) from an instruction book and from a few introductory classes that he learned at the local YMCA in his hometown. <p>He also befriends a local girl who, unfortunately is hounded by her ex-boyfriend, an arrogant and aggressive teenager who cruises around town with his friend on dirt bikes. When the ex-boyfriend catches Algren and the girl together a fight ensues and Algren is beaten and humiliated. This prompts Algren to go to the local Bushido dojo where unfortunately he discovers that the ex-boyfriend is the star pupil and the instructor is a sadist. <p>Fortunately, Algren meets Mr. Miyagi an old Samurai warrior who works as a handyman in Algren's rental unit. When Mr. Miyagi realizes Algren's dilemma he takes him on as his lone pupil and teaches him the way of Bushido. Mr. Miyagi orders Algren to paint his fence, wax his car, and strike girlie-man poses on a post by the sea shore all the while promising that this will teach him how to wield a Katana like no other Caucasian man has ever done before.<p>And somehow it works. All of Mr. Miyagi's household chores turn out to be magic Samurai conditioning techniques that convert Algren into the Unstoppable White Warrior (UWW). From here an epic battle takes place between Algren and the ex boyfriend and his evil cohorts. I won't give away the outcome of this incredible battle scene except to say that Cruise does a lot of grunting, his eyes puff out during some of the more visceral moments of combat and his beard flutters in the wind like the calm of the butterfly.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>I enjoyed watching "The Last Samurai" again.  It's one of my daughter's favorites and was under the Christmas tree for her this year.<br /><br />Tom Cruise is the star.  He plays Nathan Algren, a veteran of wars with the American Indians and is haunted by atrocities committed.  We see numerous black and white flashbacks of women and children being shot by soldiers.  Being part Native American, I found these sequences particularly moving and disturbing.  So for me, Algren's depression that sent him to drink seemed quite believable.  Cruise does seem so determined that his acting at times seems a bit forced and calculated rather than an organic performance.  That said, he was nominated for Best Actor by the Golden Globes.<br /><br />Edward Zwick directed the picture and won the Best Director Award from the National Board of Review.  He has also directed "Glory," "The Siege," & "Blood Diamond."<br /><br />Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto shined in this picture.  He's the philosophic Samurai who leads the rebellion against technological compromises with the West.  He demonstrates intelligence, compassion and the rarest of all screen commodities, wisdom.  The final battle sequence is incredible.  He well deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination.  Tim Robbins took home the gold in that category for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001ZX0OW">Mystic River (Widescreen Edition)</a>.<br /><br />Tony Goldwyn who is the grandson of movie mogul Samuel Goldwyn (think MGM) plays the role of Col. Benjamin Bagley.  Goldwyn is still most associated as the bad guy in "Ghost," and plays an arrogant soldier who despite his good looks is not sympathetic.<br /><br />Hiroyuki Sanada plays Ujio, the apparent second in command to Katsumoto.  Sanada has been nominated for five Best Actor awards from the Japanese Academy with two wins including one for his brilliant portrayal in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00065GX0K">The Twilight Samurai</a>.  He does an excellent job taking an instant dislike to Algren, battling him into the mud in a rainy day duel, and eventually coming to respect him after Nathan battles against the masked Ninja who attack their village.<br /><br />Smaller roles deserving of special mention are Koyuki's performance as Taka, who nurses Algren to health despite complaining that he smells like a pig.  She was in the Japanese film "Pulse."  Shichinosuke Nakamura plays the uncertain Emperor Meiji.  Sosuke Ikematsu does a delightful job as the young boy Higen who tries to be tough like a Samurai, but can shed a tear.  Director Masato Harada makes an acting appearance as Omura who wants to bring railroads and Western weapons to Japan.  Shin Koyamada is a good looking young actor.  He plays Nobutada who takes a number of arrows on his escape on the bridge and brings humor and determination to his screentime.  Billy Connolly who was Uncle Monty in "Lemony Snicket" plays the gray-haired Zebulon Grant who stands by Algren and suffers a fatal wound in the first battle.  Zwick does a nice job of creating a good ensemble with his cast.<br /><br />In addition to Watanabe's nomination, this film was also nominated for Oscars for Best Sound Mixing, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design.  The Japanese Academy awarded it as "Best Foreign Film."  As a piece of fictional cinema, it is a tale well told.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>After picking up my HD DVD player I've had troubles watching regular DVD movies.  I had heard some good things about this movie but couldn't pass it up once it was in high definition.<br /><br />The story is pretty good.  This is the story of Captain Algren who has been sent to Japan in the late 1800's in order to help them modernize the Japanese army as they go from fighting with swords and arrows to machine guns and cannons.<br /><br />After the "modern" Japanese army prematurely attacks the Samurai and lose horribly, Captain Algren is taken captive by the Samurai and introduced to their way of life and refusal to lay down the sword in the name of compliance.  In time, Captain Algren finds himself wanting to become one of the Samurai and learning more of their way of life.<br /><br />The story is pretty good but what raises this up to the level of being outstanding is the high definition quality of the movie.  It was fantastic, especially seeing the colorful Japanese landscape in all of its magnificence.<br /><br />If you like Tom Cruise action movies, this is one to pick up especially in high definition (whether it be Blu-Ray or HD DVD).  The violence can be extremely graphic (hey, this is war) so if you are sensitive to that you may want to look for something else.  Otherwise, the pacing of the movie is pretty good.  It isn't an all out gore-fest... there is action and then it breaks and lets you relax and catch up a little bit and then goes back to action and so on and so forth.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X15AQVSCKKRG.html">A1X15AQVSCKKRG</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this movie  Edward Zwick , it was a masterpiece it had it all. Action, suspense, a love story, sympathetic characters. That musical score too man that was almost overwhelming. I really dont understand the criticisms for<br /><br />the movie, except maybe its the biased, attitude that Americans have because this movie is a hit. Roger Ebert and Roper gave this movie critical acclaim. Its gathered a great rating on IMDB, the movie is beautifully acted, has a good story and has an epic feeling like the movie "Glory".<br /><br />The movie also was a labor of love by all involved, the costume designs and background were absolute genius, and  even Tom Cruise was one of the producers for the film.<br /><br />Catching an HBO special on it, you could tell Tom realized<br /><br />he did something special with this film.<br /><br />The story is that Tom plays a confederate like soldier ordered<br /><br />to kill a group of Japanese warriors during the middle 18 century. He encounters and is captured by Katsumot (Ken<br /><br />Watanabe). However instead of killing Nathan Algren, Katsumoto<br /><br />keeps him alive so he can get info about the Emperor's men<br /><br />that are attacking him and the American soldiers.<br /><br />Algren then during his capture sees both sides of the story,<br /><br />he realizes that Katsumoto is not the enemy, its the very<br /><br />people that hired for the job that are the enemy, from<br /><br />the corrupt officials in Asia who want to turn the country<br /><br />into a capitalistic state with the salivating Americans<br /><br />like Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwynn) ready to take advantage.<br /><br />"The Last Samurai" simply stated is an excellent movie, you will<br /><br />not waste your time watching this movie, its an excellent flick<br /><br />that deserves your viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>The Last Samurai is a showcase for Tom Cruise and he does a credible job of portraying Civil War veteran Nathan Algren who is haunted by his role in the slaughter of native Americans at the Battle of Little Big Horn.  He is hired to train the &quot;modern&quot; Japanese army in defense of Samurai warriors who persist in rebelling against modernization of the Japanese culture.  Cruise warns that his troops are not ready for battle and his prediction proves to be correct when he is defeated and captured.  He learns to respect the Samurai as he lives among them and learns their ways.  They return him to his people, but he begins to see that nobility lies with the Samurai and not with those who are trying to modernize Japan.  It is all quite simplistic and the characters are pretty much stereotyped.  There are lots of battle scenes, but never does this movie touch the emotions of the viewer.  There are tears shed, but they are all shed by the actors and not the viewers.  This is an epic film which fails to be a great one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I enjoyed it both times I saw it on the big screen, but for some reason when I bought and watched it tonight it seemed so much better than the previous viewings. The love story is classy and not overdone as in most epics and the acting is wonderful. Tom Cruise delivers his most convincing role to date and this is one of the few parts I actually liked him in (thats saying a lot!). Of course, as mentioned in numerous reviews, Ken Watanabe steals the show as the Samurai leader and should have been awarded the Oscar over Tim Robbins. The action scenes are brutal and hold your interest, (SPOILERS!!!) but I didn't like the fact that Cruise was the only character to survive the final battle. Very unrealistic and is truly the only part that brings the film down a bit. Great cinematography and an excellent soundtrack as well. I must also mention the fact that very little CGI was used in this film and that just makes the battles and actual locations that much more believable. Don't waste money renting a movie you'll want to buy the next day. Add it to your collection to watch again and again!</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>This movie is a thing of beauty, with the substance to match its style. A stunning spectacle of cultural violence and a loving tribute to the great Japanese samurai.</p></br><a href="../users/A28GCEHD00JFZG.html">A28GCEHD00JFZG</a><br/><p>The Last Samurai: 8 out of 10: I admit I greeted this movie with low expectations. The idea of Tom Cruise as the last Samurai was laughable. The movie completely suspended this disbelief right until the horribly awful last scene. Tom Cruise plays a drunken Civil War hero who hired by the Japanese government to modernize their army is captured by the Samurai rebels and falls in love with their doomed way of life.<br /><br />And what a life. Every shot of the Samurai village is postcard perfect almost to the point of unintended parody. Like Robert Redford's take on Montana in "Legends of the Fall", every view is spectacular, every sunset is orange, every leaf is colorful and falls just so and all the characters are freshly scrubbed and dressed in their Sunday best. You wouldn't be half surprised to see Hobbits pop out at any moment. Of course the old time Samurai are romanticized to the nth degree. Historically the Samurai at this point resembled Afghan warlords resisting a long overdue central government rather than the honorable colorfully armored knights that are depicted. (Samurai no more wore armor in the late 18th century than the British army did.)<br /><br />Yet the picture despite one or two faults works. The acting, with one exception is uniformly excellent. The battle scenes are plentiful and full of surprise and the pacing is good. On the dark side newcomer Nakamura Shichinosuke plays the Japanese emperor like he was channeling Michael Jackson. The voice and mannerisms of the gloved one is as out of place for a Japanese emperor than it would be for the Pope. His strangely self effacing dialogue doesn't help his cause, yet it truly is his performance that is cringe worthy. In addition the last scene is an awful Hollywood copout. I still recommend The Last Samurai highly however as a thinking mans action movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FNES0QEBJZD1.html">A1FNES0QEBJZD1</a><br/><p>I have loved this movie since it was first released and have the original DVD release which I have watched several times.  Most all the reviews I see here are either for the Standard DVD and focus on the great story line and acting but not the quality of the DVD itself.  Yes, Tom Cruse does shows some wonderful acting chops and, yes, Ken Watanabe steals the show but let's move on.  So this one will focus on the Blu-ray DVD's quality.<br /><br /> Bought the Blu-ray version from Amazon and it was delivered post haste.  When I first looked at the back cover information I was disappointed that the audio was Dolby Digital 5.1 rather than a lossless DTSHD 5.1, almost thought of returning it before even watching but am glad I kept it.  The video quality of the movie is fairly pristine with no artifacting, good details in the shadows and a sparkling clear transfer.  While the audio quality is not the higher end DTSHD, never the less, the audio engineers did a fine job with the front and rear surrounds used subtly for action( actually, during the battle scenes, the rears deserved more discreet use of the rear channels) however, during the rainy scenes, of which there are many, the audio is evenly spread to all channels enveloping you in the rainstorm.<br /><br />The many extras on the single disc are from the 2004 standard release and there are only 2 deleted scenes that, to me, could have been included in an extended version.  I wish more extended deleted scenes had been included.  The supplied extras were all interesting and, as I said before, had seen them on the original release so nothing new on that front.<br /><br />Should you buy this on Blu-ray?  Yes, the video quality is definitely superior, however, not by that much.  The original release was pretty darn good. However, if you don't already have the Standard version, go for the Blu Ray.  I remain disappointed with the lossy audio but it still provides an excellent film.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of help and, if so, please check the 'Helpful' button so I know I am on the correct path with my reviews for you. Thanks.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>This is a pretty enjoyable movie with a good amount of Japanese history in it. It's not entirely accurate, but it is still a good film nonetheless, and Tom Cruise does a good job in his role. The setting of Japan is also done well as well as its Westernization as Japanese citizens either embrace it or fight against it. Overall a good historical film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>This movie succeeds in its primary objective: it entertains.  There is a solid story here that engages the viewer, moves at a smart pace, and never drags.  Nor is this a shallow shoot-'em-up.  There is a fascinating overarching theme here: the transformation of Japan into a modern, industrial nation and the fact that elements of Japanese society, i.e. the Samurai, will not easily fit into the new order of things.<br /><br />While this film has historical inaccuracies, it is a fact that there were revolts against the Meiji Restoration, which is what this film is about.  The Japanese are portrayed respectfully, and I think accurately, in this film.  The sets and scenery, by the way, in this film are about as good as you will ever find in any movie, and this one rewards the viewer who either sees it in a theater or on a first-class flat-screen TV (as I did.)<br /><br />Tom Cruise does a pretty good job in this film, and he has plainly matured as an actor over the years.  In my opinion, however, Ken Wantanabe, as the main Japanese protagonist, dominates every scene he was in, leaving the viewer wishing for more.  I have noticed this about Cruise (and other big-star) films--the director seems compelled to place Cruise in almost every scene.  Nothing against Cruise, but a little less would have been more, because the Japanese cast was engaging and competent, and I would have liked to have seen more of them.<br /><br />Overall an excellent film to which the viewer will return more than once.  RJB.</p></br><a href="../users/A16KRCLLTHSB5F.html">A16KRCLLTHSB5F</a><br/><p>For a generic-seeming Hollywood blockbuster, The Last Samurai was remarkably true to its subject matter. My main concern walking into it was that the director would confuse the code of the samurai with western ideas about courage and honor, disregarding the more morbid side of the tradition to present some sentimental parable about discovering yourself or being good. In fact, though, the samurai ethos is treated with enough depth, the acting and pacing is excellent, and while there is some sentimental nonsense, it restrains itself more than most films do these days. The final battle is especially impressive - the choreography, the way that deaths of important characters are treated, and some of the images which arouse real pathos.<p>It's still nothing spectacular, though - it never really risks saying anything that hasn't been said before, or presenting some image which hasn't been seen before - but it's probably as good a movie as we could expect to be produced for a mass audience.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>THE LAST SAMURAI is for many of us a Sleeper of a movie.  The media mania was so high at the release time in the theaters that it seemed by the trailers that this was another massively expensive Epic riding on the Big Name Star vehicle.  Sadly, I avoided seeing this beautiful film on the big screen: now I wish I had not been so influenced by the hype.  THE LAST SAMURAI is at its core a very tender movie, a story of men overcoming their personal demons, of the power of allegiance to ideals, of forgiveness of the past and holding on to honor, of growth of the human spirit and soul.<p>1876, and America lands on the beautiful islands of Japan at the beckon of the Emperor to &quot;Westernize&quot; the country, and the army in particular, to stamp out the historical presence of the Samurai, a band of dedicated, gracefully trained warriors whose purpose was to defend the Emperor - a man believed to be the earthly manifestation of holiness.  The military men sent to perform this transformation are the guilt-ridden, alcoholic Civil War Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) and his commanding officer Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn).  The two attempt to transform the inept army of the emperor's spokesman but when they encounter in battle the Samurai warriors and their leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) they are naturally beaten.  Algren, through his native skills as a fighting man, is captured by the Samurai and is forced to live by their customs in the house of the wife Taka (Koyuki) of a man Algren had killed.  Most of the film is concerned with the gradual spiritual awakening of Algren, his commitment to the Samurai principles of battle and of life and Director Edward Zwick handles this quietly and with great dignity by exploring the growing bond among Algren, Katsumoto, and Taka.  The ultimate confrontational battle between the last of the Samurai and the newly Westernized troops of the Emperors' advisors is not only epic in scale but also mythic in values.  <p>The entire cast is excellent and a large cast this is!  But the kudos that have been awarded Watanabe have for some reason not fallen to Cruise.  They are both excellent as are Tony Goldwyn, Koyuki, Timothy Spall, etc.  The cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful, the musical score is thoughtfully eloquent, and the BIG scenes are a spectacularly Grand as the intimate scenes are extraordinarily tender.  Sometimes a great film passes us by because of the megalomania of the media hype overpowering the actual film.  Give this one a try in your home and see that it is better than you'd expected.</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>FROM START TO FINISH, MR.

The two movies have the same storyline - they even occur in the same time-period.  Just substitute Japanese for Native Americans.  <p>This movie is a good mass-entertainment.  Japanese culture and history is dumbed-down for popular consumption.  Don't quite expect the realism we find in Kurosawa films here.  Like Dances with Wolves, this movie is painfully politically-correct.  I assume that the filmmakers were forced to proceed under the assumption that American audiences might not know what the Samurai - or indeed, the Japanese - are.  The unfortunate thing is that they are probably right.  <p>We stop at all the expected signposts along the way.  The Tom Cruise character forms a growing love for the foreign, yet honorable, ways of the Samurai.  We are treated to the pre-requisite attack by Ninjas.  Fortunately, there are plenty of swordfights, but the level of realism is about the same as in Kill Bill (I know something of Japanese fencings and exchanges - like in Kurosawa films - are brief and deadly).  <p>The film looks great.  Ken Watanabe gives a great performance as the eponymous Last Samurai.  Luckily, through an eye-popping coincidence, his character happens to speak English.  Tom Cruise does a better job than he was given credit for as the lead.<p>This film succeeds as an entertainment.  I am a sucker for Samurai films so - despite its being quite long - I was not bored.  It's a good, big-budget, action epic.</p></br><a href="../users/A33TBHM3O9AY17.html">A33TBHM3O9AY17</a><br/><p>Meet Captain Nathan Algren (played by Tom Cruise), bona fide Civil War hero, celebrity endorser of Winchester rifles, and drunkard.  During the early years of the American political and cultural incursion into Japan, Algren is hired essentially as a mercenary to train the Imperial Japanese Army in the ways of modern warfare.  Before he has had a chance to do his job properly, he is called upon to lead a well-equipped but poorly trained force against a "rebel" army led by the samurai lord Katsumoto (played by Ken Watanabe).  During the initial engagement, Algren's force is routed by the samurai and Algren himself is taken prisoner by Katsumoto for the purpose of "understanding my enemy."<br /><br />Thus begins the gradual transformation of Algren from a highly stereotyped American chauvinist to a member of Katsumoto's community.  The early reception is cold and unaccepting, both by Katsumoto's family and his fellow samurai, but over time a grudging tolerance gives way to cautious familiarity and ultimately to full acceptance and respect.  As I observed this process, I could not help being reminded of "Dances With Wolves", in which Kevin Costner's character undergoes a similar rebirth.  This notion was fueled even more by the romantic energy between Algren and the widow of a samurai whom he had killed during his capture.<br /><br />Algren eventually rises to enjoy great respect and admiration among Katsumoto's people, becoming in effect the samurai lord's right-hand man and deputy commander.  He helps lead Katsumoto's forces in several battles against the Japanese army, including the climactic final engagement where his honor is put to the ultimate test (but I won't spoil the ending for those who haven't seen it yet).<br /><br />Overall, I found this to be a very enjoyable and moving tale of the clash of cultures, somewhat loose in its historicity, with a strong emphasis on concepts like valor, honor and independence.  The story line was slightly cliche and more than a little romanticized, but hey, that's Hollywood.  Watch it and decide for yourself, but I certainly wouldn't mind seeing it again.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>SPOILERS INCLUDED<br /><br />THE LAST SAMURAI is one of the best efforts of Tom Cruise's uneven and strange career. Very loosely based on actual events, THE LAST SAMURAI recounts the story of the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, when the Samurai forced the last stand of traditional Japanese culture against the the modernizing influences of the Meiji Restoration.<br /><br />As part of his drive to bring Japan into the family of nations the Meiji Emperor hired literal armies of foreign advisors. In the film Cruise plays Captain Nathan Algren, a survivor of Gettysburg who later served under Custer and fought Indians on the frontier. The brutalities he has seen have rendered Captain Algren a nightmare-ridden and viciously cynical drunkard. Recruited to go to Japan and train the modern Japanese Army by his despised former superior, Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), Algren at first adopts the endemic sneering attitude toward the Samurai shared by the "modernizers". However, the more he hears of the Samurai, the more respect Algren begins to accord them, much to the disgust of his fellows.<br /><br />When his green army is forced into a premature engagement with the Samurai, Algren is captured and held prisoner by the Samurai leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Watanabe is the true star of this film. His powerful but understated performance is electric, and Katsumoto's character expresses the best of the Bushido Code and of Japanese tradition. As Algren observes his enemies (and they observe him), hatred mellows into distrust, distrust mellows into acquiescence, acquiescence mellows into acceptance, acceptance becomes respect, and respect becomes liking, and then true friendship. Algren, the professional soldier, comes to see the Bushido Code and the disciplined lifestyle of his captors as the highest expression of his own art---the Art of War. When battle comes, Algren casts his lot with the Samurai.<br /><br />Although given a safe passage to Tokyo, Katsumoto is unable to sway the young and timid Meiji Emperor, his former student, who is as much a prisoner of the "modernizers" as Algren had been of the Samurai traditionalists. Hostilities flare again when Omura (Masato Harada) the chief of the "modernizers" tries to have Katsumoto assassinated. The Samurai withdraw into the mountains and prepare for the final battle. When it comes, the Samurai nearly overwhelm their opponents, but armed with cannons and gatling guns, the modern army is insurmountable. In the end, only Algren survives to bring Katsumoto's sword to the Emperor. Although Algren is spat upon by Omura, the Meiji Emperor is so moved by Katsumoto's reverence for the old ways that he orders Omura to commit seppuku. In the end, the cowardly Omura merely exiles himself.<br /><br />THE LAST SAMURAI had only a lukewarm reception in the United States. Some reviewers felt that the character of Captain Algren was of the "White Man's Burden" ilk, that the film was disrespectful of the American historical experience, and that the Samurai were overidealized. Much of this can be put down to a festering dislike of Cruise in the wake of his divorce from Nicole Kidman. However, the film was wildly successful in Japan, and many moviegoers left the theaters in tears, moved by the powerful depiction of traditional Japanese values in the character of Katsumoto and his fellow Samurai. While it is true that much of the Bushido Code was vastly oversimplified in the telling, the essence of Samurai values permeates the film, which, after all, is a form of entertainment, not a philosophical discussion.<br /><br />The "Extras" disc is an "Extras" disc. Once a pastiche of fascinating folderol, "Extras" discs have degenerated into a predictable melange of "The Making Of...", pointless commentaries, and deleted scenes we wish had stayed deleted. This one isn't much different, though it does have a nice "Hollywood vs. History" segment that discusses the real samurai, in truth largely a repressive and regressive elite that had outlived themselves in the 19th century. What might have been very interesting would have been a discussion of how the Bushido Code was institutionally perverted into racist militarism in the first half of the 20th century. The segment barely touches on that subject.<br /><br />A vast and sweeping epic in the vein of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX95">Braveheart</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783226039">Spartacus</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXB2">Lawrence of Arabia (Limited Edition)</a>, THE LAST SAMURAI is an engaging, respectful, and moving tale well worth watching many more times than once.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YAABMT80RLYA.html">A2YAABMT80RLYA</a><br/><p>"The Last Samurai" is everything a movie should be - exciting, emotional, and involving. Though I would not go so far to say that it's a masterpiece, it is one of the better movies I have seen in 2003, and without having seen the new "Lord of the Rings", it's definitely near the top of the list. It will no doubt draw comparison with "Braveheart" because of the epic battles and the emotional climax, but thankfully avoids becoming derivative of other "battle epics".<p>Tom Cruise (who spent two years learning Japanese) plays Nathan Algren, a civil war hero who has fallen off the right path and is now washed up and heavily into the booze. His fortunes change when he is commissioned by the Emperor of Japan to help train his army to fight efficiently against the Samurai who roam the country. His success with that endeavor is short lived when he is captured by the Samurai during a devastating battle. He spends the next several months living among them and adopting their ways, and growing fond of the discipline, skill, and tact that the Samurai display. Knowing of the Emperor's motives to rid Japan of the people and way of life he has come to embrace, he joins them in their battle against insurmountable odds. <p>There are many subplots and characters, some predictable Hollywood fodder (do you smell a love story cooking?), but most are effective and necessary to the overall story. "The Last Samurai" is tempered with humorous moments that help to balance the violence that is peppered throughout. As you can expect, many of the battles are long, drawn out, and very bloody. But the violence is never gratuitous, and it knows it's limits. As far as performances go, Tom Cruise is nothing if not reliable, and his largely Japanese supporting cast all do a great job in hitting their cues and making us believe in them. What really deserves special mention is the cinematography, which captures Japans lush valleys, majestic temples, and overall aesthetic beauty. The battle choreography is also stellar, obviously benefiting for painstaking direction and CGI effects. <p>"The Last Samurai" is not a history lesson, so you are unlikely to walk away from it having gained a substantial knowledge of the Samurai customs and traditions. What you will get out of it is a fantastic movie-going experience that satisfies on every level, which is exactly what we go to movies for.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>Former Paramount studios chief Robert Evans used to call his holiday pictures "Christmas gifts to the world," and "The Last Samurai" is staged just so: Much of it is handsome, magnificent and morally decent, yet the movie is full of itself, in both solemnity and faraway gaze. Edward Zwick's latest giant is in need of a bit of exuberance to push it over into classic status, and the director never quite gets enough of it, and certainly not from star Tom Cruise, in permanent furrowed brow. <p>Developed from an interesting story by John Logan, "The Last Samurai" concerns Capt. Nathan Algren (Cruise), a drunk, disillusioned cavalry solider in 1870s hired to train a "modernized" Japanese army defeat the legendary mountain samurais, whose "bushido" code of discipline has long defended the nation. The samurai are led by their last great fighter, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), fight by sword and bow, and have the fealty of the people. The upwardly mobile Japanese ambassador Omura (Masato Harada) has the ear of the young emperor (Shichinosuke Nakamura). <p>Bushido code is such that Katsumoto would drop his sword if the emperor wished it so; until then, he leads charges against green Japanese troops. In one battle, pitched in the forest by fog light, he wounds Algren, captures him and ushers the captain to a mountain hideout to study his recovering enemy. The samurai village is beautifully realized; Zwick and cinematographer John Toll ("Braveheart") purposely create a utopia at high elevation. With a valley in the distance reminiscent of a fertile green ocean, Algren begins to adjust to the mood and practice of the warriors and prove himself worthy of it while kindling a romance with a samurai's widow (beautiful, expressive Koyuki).  <p>While Katsumoto may belong to an ancient order, he speaks English, displays a quick sense of humor and seeks to trade wisdom with Algren rather than merely dispensing it. His philosophy is unbending, but his moods aren't. Watanabe is so good because he plays against the expectation of the stern, authoritarian titan, and, with a smile, steals most of the scenes away from Cruise, who affects the broken man about as well as a naturally expressive actor can. <p>Inevitably, Algren wins a few mock battles and stands beside Katsumoto during a midnight ninja attack, setting the stage for Algren's conflicted return back to his old post in Tokyo, then his subsequent change of heart that leads to fierce final battle between tradition and guns, played out in the valley we've seen from afar the entire movie.<p>Four-act films are rare, but Zwick doesn't fight the built-in structure, uses it, in fact to cover all the political bases, punctuating the end of each with a clash of some sort. The ninja raid has a hint of Kurosawa, while the forest sequences echoes the Vietnam movies of Stone and Coppola. The final battle is a close cousin to "Braveheart" and deserves to be mentioned with it. Cruise and Watanabe worked the swords themselves, and betray no weaknesses. Zwick is a fabulous combat director, and considering the movie's scope, deserves a mention during awards season.<p>"The Last Samurai" never quite reconciles what movie it prefers to be. It forces a romance between Algren and Taka, the widow, when there's no time to develop it. It tacks on a needless, uplifting epilogue to a naturally earth-moving conclusion. The movie errs on the side of being disconsolate, too, in portraying the one-dimensionally evil Omura and Col. Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), one of Algren's former superiors who enjoyed slaughtering innocents in Indian raids. Such stark lines of romance and villainy detract from the movie's underlying elegy of samurais courting death against the machines.</p></br><a href="../users/AB9QXH5URDLER.html">AB9QXH5URDLER</a><br/><p>The Last Samurai is entertaining.<br />I got involved with the characters and wanted everything to turn out well.<br />The action sequences are well done.<br />The acting is well done.<p>However,<br />The plot is formula.<br />The ending, while throwing in a twist or two is still predictable.<br />The moral theme has been done to the hilt.<p>In Short,<br />This is a good movie to rent, but I wouldn't spend a lot of money to add it to my collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>THE LAST SAMURAI doesn't stand up to anything by Kurosawa, but it did prove that Tom Cruise could act, and it is a very watchable film.

The whole wash-up, has-been hero finds a new sense of self and identity with people once perceived as "barbarian" or "savage". The theme has been done before and probably will be again.<br /><br />In "The Last Samurai", Capt. Algren is sent to Japan during the tale end of the Meiji Restoration to train the new Imperial Army in modern warfare. Despite the excellent pay, Algren is an alcoholic with some serious personality issues to boot. The new Imperial Army is soon sent into battle with the other problem: a rebel force of samurai led by Katsumoto, (Ken Watanabe). The results are predictably disastrous and Algren is captured alive. The rest of the plot follows a predictable pattern that most will be familiar with.<br /><br />The character of Katsumoto is actually based, albeit very loosely, on a real person whol live during a similar time and fought in Kyushu. The real man was one Saigo Takamori, who also committed seppuku according to legend. He actually died from bullet wounds sustained during his last stand near Kagoshima. A good book about the man is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471705373">The Last Samurai: The Life and Battles of Saigo Takamori</a>, which is also an excellent read.<br /><br />Tom Cruise puts in an excellent performance, I have to say, as the dysfunctional Algren. Ken Watanabe is amazing in his protrayal of the samurai rebel leader, Katsumoto, bringing an intensity and depth to the movie that can be lacking in other characters.<br /><br />There are some small issues of error, such as ferns and so on in the forests. Being shot in New Zealand, the movie has some scenery from that country that is visibly not Japanese. However, these points are very small and do not take away from the spectacle of the film and its location.<br /><br />The battle scenes are truly amazing, and well shot. There is enough action and some comic relief to keep everyone pretty well entertained. The cultural differences between Algren and his Japanese hosts are a source of some amusement, especially as the younger samurai take a liking to him. This is despite the regular beatings he receives from older samurai he tries to take on.<br /><br />Despite the predictability of the movie, and the lack of originality in some regards, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I liked the style, the action, and the plot, and came away feeling thoroughly entertained and somewhat moved. I just simply liked the movie as overall, well-presented package.</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>The Last Samurai is a beautiful film, the kind of epic that David Lean might have made.  The film is true to historical events that happened in Japan during 1876-77.  In particular, meticulous care was taken with the recreation of Tokyo and the clothing that was being worn, traditional Japanese and modern clothing. The clash of tradition versus the influence of the West is sharply portrayed in these contrasts. Like all historical epics, departures and simplifications of the truth have to be made for the sake of a coherent film.  Certainly, there were no Americans fighting along with the samurai but the character of Captain Algren allows us to explore what is going on in Japan from the traditional and modernistic points of view.  What makes The Last Samurai an excellent historical film is what also makes for a great historical novel: sticking close to historical facts, knowing the details of the society your characters are living in and developing a believable and interesting story.  The story of The Last Samurai fulfills all of this for me.<br /><br />Edward Zwick has captured some excellent performances.  Tom Cruise as Captain Algren has a truly memorable performance, one that he trained for several months to deliver.  I must confess that I was not a early fan of Tom Cruise but his work in recent years has been impressive and in this film he truly becomes the character he is portraying. Ken Watanabe is wonderful as Kasumoto, loosely based on the life of Saigo Takamori, capturing the essence of the duty of a samurai and also the contemplative side of a warrior.  The talk of his writing a poem on a blossom reminded me that prior to the real battle depicted in the film the warriors spent the night before engaged in writing poetry.  The performances by the supporting cast are excellent.  Of special note is Koyuki (playing Taka, Kasumoto's sister) who must care for the man who killed her husband and who gradually finds herself falling in love.  Her sensitive performance is one of the highlights of the film.  Shin Koyamada, who plays Kasumoto's son Nobutada, brings pathos to his character, particularly in the scene where he is humiliated by Japanese soldiers for being dressed as a samurai.<br /><br />The battle sequences were carefully stage with an eye for authenticity and the village where Algren is kept a prisoner was so meticulously constructed that the Japanese extras were struck by its resemblance to the villages where they grew up.<br /><br />The cinematography is very impressive and the music by Hans Zimmer beautifully builds the mood.  The DVD has some wonderful supplemental pieces that explain various aspects of the production of the film. The Last Samurai is a film that will be highly regarded years from now as among the best Hollywood has produced.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Do you imagine the awful scenes of what it meant the invassion of the German Panzers in Polland Sepember 1 1939 when the resistance fought ridden on horses?<br />Well , this was the impression i reminded on the last sequence of this film .<br />The Last Samurai is a brave film that reveals the significance of the honor in the Samurai culture .<br />The script is very related in conceptual approach to Dance with wolves in which nathan concerns .

The sets and scenary were beautiful. The acting was excellent. Tom Cruise created a complex character. The battle scenes were reminscent of Braveheart. The comparison to &quot;Dancing with Wolves&quot; is fairly accurate. Both movies argue the thesis that other cultures are inherently superior morally and spiritually to the spiritually bankrupt Western European/United States culture. There was a lot of spurting blood. The fight scene between ninjas and Samurai was good.  <p>The clash of cultures was interesting. I do not know enough about the history of this period to judge its historical accuracy. I know the broad strokes were true. The Japanese Emperor hired Civil War veterans to modernize his armies and the Emperor had to put down the Ronans because they refused to modernize. There are probably far better Japanese movies of the period. <p>My main gripe about the movie was the ending. The movie went on too long. I enjoyed the movie, but the ending left a bad taste in my mouth.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>There's a cast of thousands and millions of dollars invested in this epic and it will probably pay off for Hollywood.  The theme is an inspiring one too.  It's set in the late 19th Century, where Tom Cruise, a veteran of the Civil War as well as some cruel Indian massacres, goes to Japan to train the Emperor's army against the Samurai so that Japan can modernize.  That's an oversimplification of this politically correct story for which I have seen no claims of being historically accurate.<p> <p>Soon, Cruise is captured by the Samurai and, learns to respect them.  Ken Watanabe is the Samurai leader who believes in honor and all that other good stuff as compared to the avaricious Americans.  There's excellent cinematography of a Japan that no longer exists and well-orchestrated battle scenes that are spectacular and bloody.  And, not surprising, I felt no emotion other than to marvel at the great costuming and special effects.<p> <p>This is the third film about Japan I've seen in the last few weeks.  Clearly, it is the weakest.  It's not that it's not well done.  It is.  But it's basically a genre film that cost big bucks.  <p> <p>It's fine escape fiction though.  The sets are great.  And you'll be entertained.  Mildly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>The Last Samurai has all the right ingredients of a modern day masterpiece, it's ultimate flaw however is it's too predictable Hollywood components.  The story revolves around tormented Civil War veteran Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) who is coerced to train the Japanese Emperor's troops in the use of modern western weaponry.  Standing in the way is a rebellion of samurai warriors led by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe in his Oscar nominated role) who refuse to let go of their honorable traditions despite being at a disadvantage.  When Algren is captured, he learns and eventually adopts the way of the samurai; culminating in a would be epic battle that ends with a whimper.  It seemed screenwriter John Logan had bigger plans, but the Hollywood conventions injected here from director Edward Zwick and Cruise hamper what could have been something really special.  That aside though, the Last Samurai is still a great film, and Cruise and Watanabe are brilliant when both share the screen.  All in all, despite it's shortcomings, the Last Samurai is a wonderful film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R8AO9XASQ15C.html">A1R8AO9XASQ15C</a><br/><p>I enjoyed &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; as a piece of epic entertainment, but it misses true greatness by at least a mile. The movie might best be described as a hybrid of &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; and &quot;Braveheart,&quot; with maybe a little &quot;Gladiator&quot; thrown in. I kept feeling like I'd seen this movie before.<p>Actually, the movie works best when it's in &quot;Dances&quot; mode, chronicling the adventures of a depressed white Civil War hero (Cruise in the Costner role) who adopts the lifestyle and teachings of a threatened civilization and ends up defending said civilization against encroaching white society. This is the most compelling aspect of the movie, even though its structure is borrowed whole from a film that most people now claim to despise because of its &quot;political correctness.&quot;<p>Cruise is very good as Nathan Algren, the alien in 19th century Japan, caught in the middle of a civil war of another kind, between ancient Samurai warriors and a government seeking to &quot;modernize&quot; itself with weapons imported from the U.S. He's bested by Ken Watanabe as a Samurai tribal chief interested in learning the ways of his enemy. Algren eventually becomes an honorary Samurai himself and fights against his own people, in a climactic battle lifted entirely from &quot;Braveheart.&quot;<p>Most of the action scenes are exciting, and there's plenty of Bushido lore and swordplay to keep Samurai enthusiasts happy. The photography is gorgeous, too. But it's still Hollywood's idea of an alien culture, a story told through the eyes of a white man who, by definition, can never fully experience the culture which the movie itself so desperately wants us to understand.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>1876 in Japan, an American soldier named Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) has been hired by the Emperor Meijii to train some Japanese soldiers to fight against the savage Samurai.

Co-starring Tony Goldwyn, Billy Connelly and Hiroyuki Sanada Koyuki this is a well made and violent adventure film that has a familar old story. Although very similar to films like "Man Named Horse", "Dances with Wolves", "Lawrence of Arabia" or "Last of the Mohicans" this one takes the old story of those to Japan instead of being in the western times or the French-Indian war or Arabia. The acting is flawless as is the direction, the action sequences are gory and well made and the photography is just stunning as is Han Zimmer's score.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers quality picture in a great transfer that looks fresher and the sound is good as well and the extras include audio commentary, History Channel Documentary: Hollywood vs. History, 4 featurettes, deleted scenes, Japan premiere and trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>For the first hour and forty minutes this is a near faultless film which examines the very heart of the human soul. Cruise plays a brilliant US army soldier, Captain Algren who has seen one too many battles and is haunted by the horrific injustices dealt to the American Indians by himself and his fellow US soldiers.<br /><br />He is offered a large sum of money to train the Japanese army so that it can fight the last of the rebel Samurai tribes. In the opening battle he is captured by the Samurai and it is then that he can see the parallel with the Indians and eventually switches sides. All this is beautifully filmed and some of the scenes in the Samurai village, when Captain Algren is gradually adapting to the Samurai way of life reminded me of Kevin Costners Dances with Wolves.<br /><br />I am not especially a fan of Tom Cruise but he is good in this. However it is Ken Watanabe as the Samurai leader Katsumoto who shines throughout the film. In supporting roles Billy Connelly and Timothy Spall are both<br />very good.<br /><br />Sadly in the last half hour the film lost a lot of credibility for me, hence I have only given it four stars. Without giving away the ending I can't be specific in my criticism of this part, but suffice to say I wish the writers had come up with something better and more believable!<br /><br />Overall though its a very good film, which I think will improve on 2nd and 3rd viewings.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LXKO2S6G2DBI.html">A3LXKO2S6G2DBI</a><br/><p>Call it "Dances with Asians" or "Japaneseheart," Edward Zwick's "The Last Samurai" suffers from a near-fatal case of seen-it-before-itis.  If the "I haven't figured out the right dose of Ritalin to take yet" presence of Tom Cruise grates on your nerves as much as it does mine, you'll be pleasantly surprised to find that he at times gives a measured and even subtle performance as a shell-shocked cavalry officer prostituting himself to teach the Japanese military the brutally efficient techniques of Western warfare.  His supporting cast of talented Asian actors is better, though even Ken Watanabe, who at times resembles Lawrence Fishburne in expression and intensity, is no Toshiro Mifune.  Where the movie breaks down is with John Logan's shallow script, which like most Western films about the East, implies complexity mostly by making Asians esoteric and tight-lipped; but for all of the posturing, there is no real wisdom offered in a story meant to explore culture clash.  Instead, viewers are distracted by battle scenes that probably would have seemed grand had the aforementioned films (with corrected titles), as well as "Gladiator" and "The Last of the Mohicans," not beaten this one to the punch.  Zwick even plagiarizes his own film, the much better "Glory," and fans of Hans Zimmer's "The Thin Red Line" soundtrack will be pleased to note that some of it seems to make its way into this film.  All in all, "The Last Samurai" isn't a bad film.  With an attractive cast and nods to historical authencity, such as ill-fitting uniforms, it's also not bad to look at, even if some suspiciously modern looking powerlines turn up in one scene.  It's just that we've seen most of it already.</p></br><a href="../users/ALG7QH2L5JL2L.html">ALG7QH2L5JL2L</a><br/><p>I'm not a Tom Cruise fan. Actually the opposite is true. Also, knowing something of the Samurai and Samurai swordcraft, I automatically zoom in on the flaws and inconsistencies in those areas. This doesn't matter in movies like ZATOICHI, which are definitely tongue-in-cheek, but in something more serious like TLS it matters.<br /><br />So I found myself pleasantly surprised that not only did I not mind Tom Cruise so much (after the first 15 minutes or so, where he overdoes the 'Tom Cruise' bits) and the sword work (bokken and shinken) was handled with an acceptable degree of authenticity. The movie also paid suitable homage to the Samurai, who on one hand carried with them the whole baggage of a feudal repressive culture, but who also embodied much of what one might call the 'spirit of Japan'. It's an ambiguous situation, where nothing's all good or bad, but when it ends like it did end there's a lot of pathos and sadness, no matter WHAT the merits or not.<br /><br />This was well-handled and the movie made a real impact - on this reviewer anyway.<br /><br />Till Noever<br />Author: KEAEN, SELADIENNA, CONTINUITY SLIP<br />owlglass.com</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: This film was one of the surprises for me of 2003. I saw Tom Cruise playing in this Samurai genre film that looked very bad. I was the victim of bad marketing. The trailer does not show what the movie is truly about. This film is a wonderful exploration of interaction among societies and how the world as a diverse planet can learn from one another. The film was excellent because it really showed the audience about Samurai life and built on the characters and their ideologies. We learn through watching how a Samurai grows up trained to obey the emperor and lives by honor. Through the intense character development comes the importance of the ending. Cruise also gave a good performance but as you've all heard, Ken Watanabe steals the show. Hans Zimmer's score also brought the movie to life as does all of his incredible scores for their movies. The Last Samurai does however becomes the victim of Hollywood cinema. The film is not all historically accurate, but then again the purpose of the film isn't really to be a documentary, but more of a character exploration. This is a movie that is a little gem, not a masterpiece, but not something you want to throw away.<p>VIDEO: The only problem with this transfer is a little grain here and there, but overall a nice effort by Warner.

Tom Cruise, maybe in his best performance ever, plays Nathan Algren, a veteran of the Civil War that now lives in oblivion as an alcoholic ad-boy for a weapons company. He's invited to Japan to train the Imperial Army against a bunch of rogue samurai. The Imperial Army represents the new Japan (in 1876), a nation that has turned its eyes to the western world. The samurai represent the old japanese style, fighting without fire weapons, living a life of discipline, simplicity, commitment and respect for the nature, etc. <p>This clash of so different cultures is what makes this movie interesting. Besides, there are many dialogues spoken in japanese (what helps create the correct atmosphere), the costumes and figurines are excellent, and the battle scenes, that some people found to be not well-represented and slow, caught my attention every time. <p>Not only Tom Cruise is good, though a little too intense; the girl Koyuki and, especially, this amazing actor Ken Watanabe play their parts with a tremendous ease and desenvolture, giving us, westerners, a glimpse of what japanese culture is (or was). <p>OK, the script is Hollywood from beginning to end, but, nonetheless, Edward Zwick did a competent job, just like he did in another exceptional movie, "Glory". I did not enoy "The las samurai" because of its story, but because its very well enacted, colorful and it portraits one of the most interesting cultures in the world. Maybe something that helped me like this movie is the fact that I've never watched (and I'm ashamed to say so) an Akira Kurosawa movie. <p>Grade 8.7/10</p></br><a href="../users/A20ZFWGBY4REFX.html">A20ZFWGBY4REFX</a><br/><p>"The Last Samurai" is, without a doubt, one of the finest action epics thatI have seen ever since "Braveheart"! "The Last Samurai" is one of those rare films that combine a sweeping, heroic epic with an intimate, extremely poignant personal story of love, honor, and tenderness. The direction of Edward Zwick ("Glory", "Courage Under Fire") was top-notch and powerful! And the performance of superstar Tom Cruise ("Minority Report") was unforgettable! Surely one of the best Tom Cruise performances since "Top Gun"!<p>The film focuses on Nathan Algren (Cruise), a decorated war hero (from the war against the American Indians) now drunkenly relegated to showing off new gun technology at expositions. Algren is offered handsome compensation to leave the States and help bring Japan into the modern age of guns and to suppress a revolt of nontechnological samurai making trouble in the hinterlands. During a raid that is botched by unready troops, Algren is captured but not before managing to cleverly kill off one of the most accomplished samurai. The samurai lord, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), is impressed with Algren's magificent fighting spirit and resourcefulness and decides to nurse him back to health so that he might learn more about his enemy.<p>The premise revealed. I will skip the rest of the plot, saying only that it is inevitable that Algren comes to respect and then love the ways of his captors and becomes himself an accomplished warrior in their disciplined traditions. He soon allies himself against his former compatriots and must learn what true honor is and how both life and death can help one reach his destiny. Essentially, and I do not say this casually, this film is "Dances with Wolves" set among the Japanese "other" rather than the American "other".<p>The film started like a Tom Cruise movie, stopped being one for a fascinating hour or so, and then returned to its Hollywood roots. When we first see Cruise, he is doing his trademark Cruise acting: slightly over the top in his anger, drunkenness, and overall swagger. However, once Algren is abducted, we get to see some really nice stuff. Thank goodness for the strength and charisma of his co-star, Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto. Watanabe is as focused and economical an actor I have seen in some time and manages to communicate more rage, love, or concern in a steely glance than Cruise can with a monologue's worth of bluster.<p>It's great watching Algren and Katsumoto (and incidentally, Cruise and Watanabe) learn from each other and settle each other down. Cruise is at his best here when he's 'listening', when someone else is driving the scene. I dare say even that he's better when speaking his scant lines of Japanese than those in English because it forces him most convinvingly out of his element. However, just as we come to admire Cruise's identification with samurai stillness and restraint (and what one can achieve with a "good death"), the spirit of the movie swings back across the Pacific to Hollywood again, and we have a fairly typical Cruise ending that betrays what we have come to appreciate most about "The Last Samurai" -- the acceptance of destiny. I won't spoil the end, but I will say that whether or not Algren survives the climactic battle (between sword-wielding samurai and newfangled howitzer repeating rifles) makes or breaks the point of Algren's spiritual conversion.<p>"The Last Samurai" is beautifully filmed, and like two of director Ed Zwick's own definitive films -- "Courage Under Fire" and "Glory" -- this one asks challenging questions about honor and country from the perspective of outsiders. In conclusion, "The Last Samurai" not only has two unforgettable performances by Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe, but also a fine supporting cast including Timothy Spall, Billy Connolly, Tony Goldwyn, Koyuki, and William Atherton. "The Last Samurai" is a definite DVD must-have when it's released!</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>As epic movies go, &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; is a superb one despite any historical inaccuracies which is what the History Channel is for.  All of the big named male actors such as Mel Gibson and Russell Crowe had their epic war movies and Tom Cruise was sorely due for one and in this movie he chose very well.  Over the years, like many super stars, Tom Cruise has chosen some extremely good roles and at the other end of the spectrum he's done some very poor movies but with &quot;The Last Samurai,&quot; the part couldn't have been better for him as it was supremely suited to his talents.<p>Along with the superior performance given by Tom Cruise, his co-actors in Timothy Spall, Ken Watanabe, Billy Connolly, Tony Goldwyn, Hiroyuki Sanada and Koyuki and so many others added greatly to the overall feel of the movie through their performances which were all of great depth and feeling.<p>Over the years, Edward Zwick has directed some of the finest movies to ever grace the silver screen such as &quot;Glory&quot; and &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; and &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; serves well to his legacy by being added to his library of exceptional films.  Additional credit goes to Hans Zimmer for the score for this outstanding film.<p>The Premise:<p>Civil War hero Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) has seen all too well the horrors of war and the policies of the American government in both dealing with soldiers of the south and especially Native Americans.  He is essentially forced into going to Japan to fight for the government against the Samurai that have for so long defended Japan but are now anachronistic in their eyes.  In a twist of fate, he is forced to lead his forces against the Samurai before they are ready and his forces are easily routed and he is captured.<p>Feeling merciful and wanting to learn more about his new enemy, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) spares his life and takes him to his village for the winter.  Captain Algren spends that time there and suddenly finds a rebirth...<p>What follows from there is an exceptional film both in its touching and intriguing story and the extraordinary battle scenes.  I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of films in this genre as they will be highly satisfied with it.  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>-Commentary by Director Edward Zwick<br />-History Channel Documentary &quot;History vs. Hollywood:  The Last Samurai&quot;<br />-Tom Cruise A Warrior's Journey<br />-Edward Zwick:  Director's Video Journal<br />-Making an Epic:  A Conversation with Edward Zwick and Tom Cruise<br />-A World of Detail:  Production Design with Lilly Kilvert<br />-Silk and Armor:  Costume Design with Ngila Dickson<br />-Imperial Army Basic Training<br />-From Soldier to Samurai:  The Weapons<br />-Deleted Scenes<br />-Japan Premieres<br />-DVD-ROM PC Web Link<br />-Theatrical Trailer</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>After the opening of Japan in 1853 under the pressure of the US and their Perry expedition, and the restoration of Imperial power in 1867, things went very fast. Japan was modernized at first to the best profit of the USA. But this development brought strong resistance within Japan from the feudal order of the Samourais, and a very agressive expansion on the Asian continent. This film concentrates on the final push against feudalism and its old code of honor represented by the Samourais. This change was particularly brutal with imported weapons from the USA, an exclusive contract, and military counsellors. The move was led by some big capitalist families who were ruthless about the change and who violently eradicated all opposition to the final death of it and them. The film shows this very well. The character Tom Cruise embodies here is probably fictitious but it links the wars against the Indians in the US to this war against mountain tribes and villages in Japan. The same objective : to impose industrial development in an extremely egotistic way : no honor, no real democracy, no concertation. Just change, and profits for a few. The film is short on one issue : this forced change led the new industrial aristocracy to an expansion that was carried out through war and the use of brutal force. Japan needed new markets and new workers. They found them in Formosa, in China, in Manchuria, in Korea, and they even tried to conquer Siberia. We know what that process led to forty years later. We should never force foreign countries to change too fast and along a ruthless profit-minded road because profit knows no obstacles, and frustration leads to a need for historical compensation, and sooner or later the two come together. Any country should have the right to change at its own rhythm and along its own logic.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/A13TO1ZFAH9SVN.html">A13TO1ZFAH9SVN</a><br/><p>I can't get enough of this movie. The Last Samurai is a powerful tale that stays with you. I can't get enough of this modern masterpice.<br /><br />Capt. Nathan Algren(Cruise) is an Army veteran. He's become an alcholic and hates himself and frequently has flashbacks over some of the Indians he's killed. He's falling apart and things don't look great for him until he's offered a job by the ambassador of Japan Umura(Hamada).<br /><br />The Emperor of Japan is modernizing the country and doing it very quickly. The Emperors former advisor Katsumota(Watanabe) doesn't like the old ways and is doing everything in his power to delay them. He is one of the greatest Samurai to ever live and is well respected and loved by his people. Umura nows Japan can't beat him so he convinces the Emperor that they must modernize so they can defeat Katsumoto.<br /><br />Algren comes to Japan reluctantly. He hates Col. Bagley(Goldwyn) who is his superior officer in the operation. He's trying to train the Japanese men as fast as he can, but they don't have a enough time. Umura and Bagley order Algren to takes his men into battle against Katsumoto agains his will.<br /><br />The fight between the armies is quick and very bloody. Katsumoto captures Algren after seeing the passion and fire in his eyes during battle. They take Algren back to their village for winter so Katsumoto can get to learn his enemy better.<br /><br />Algren is treated fairly well by the people. They help him overcome his alcholism battle. He hates the place at first, but as he lives there and sees the discipline of the Samurai people he begins to accept and love their culture. He becomes friends with Katsumoto and gains respect from most of the village. Winter ends though and he must return to Tokyo.<br /><br />Upon his return to Tokyo he sees the advance of the Japanese army. Umora has increased the spending of Japan in their arms and it's obvious he has lots of influence over the emperor. Umora is determined to kill the Samurai and Katsumoto. After a scuffle in Tokyo Algren returns with the Samurai to help prepare them in their last stand against the Japanese army.<br /><br />The acting is phenomenal in this movie. Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are amazing in their roles as Algren and Katsumoto. Cruise plays the role with passion and intensity. He does a great job displaying the change that Algren takes emotionaly and physically. He really did get cheated by not getting an Oscar nomination. This guy has done a lot for the movie industry and the academy but they continue to not pay him back. Cruise almost didn't do this movie because of his commitment to Cold Mountain. They didn't give the money he wanted so he became The Last Samurai.<br /><br /> Ken Watanabe really shines in this picture. He isn't intimidated by Cruise at all and is equal if not better to him. He becomes Katsumoto and is amazing. He's funny, brave, charming, and smart all at the same time. He deserved the Oscar nomination he received and probaly should have won it. I'm excited about seeing Ken in the new Batman movie. This guy is great.<br /><br />Edward Zwick really does a great job with this movie. The Last Samurai is produced by Cruises production company and they were the only man they wanted to direct this. Zwick has plenty of experience in this area of movies with Glory on his resume. He shots this movie well and it's all done in tastes. The fight scenes are shot especially well. The camera angles are great and we really get a good idea of how the Samurai fought. The violence isn't over done and you see the art that is sword play. Zwick has made a masterpiece.<br /><br />A lot of people have bashed the ending of the movie. They think it's sappy and to happy. It's anything but that. If you pay attention to the movie and realize that Algren didn't fail his mission he has no shame. Algren loved Katsumoto and so did the Emperor so thats why we have that scene at the ending of the well. I found it to be a powerful ending to a dynamic film.<br /><br />This is a great movie. It's so well made and attention is paid in it to the tiniest details. This movie will stay with you for days and all the good dramas do. If you like dramas or war films than you must see this film. If you love Tom Cruise you have to pick this one up. You won't regret buying this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>&quot;The Last Samurai&quot; is one of the greatest historical epics of our generation. The battle scenes are created with great action and detail, as are the solo sword fights. And while the action is breathtaking, they only help to tell an amazing yet somber story of honor, sacrifice and change. Tom Cruise gives what is possibly the performance of his career, and Ken Watanabe gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Katsumoto (He was robbed at the Oscars). While I haven't yet had time to view the special features, none are really needed, for this film could stand on its own! Any fan of true film will want this epic in their collection! Movie/DVD Grade: A+</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>I strongly urge the viewers to watch the second disc after viewing the movie itself.  The presentation of the disc is superb and for a movie enthusiast like myself, I appreciate knowing the thoughts of Director, the cast, the process, the location, the designs of costumes and the set, and so forth.  This disc collection has got them all.  It's wonderful to note that some of Japanese actors and actresses in the movie played a significant role by assisting the Director, Zwick in understanding the protocols and behaviours of the past when Samurais roamed Japan.  There's a tremendous respect between the Japanese and the production crew as they assisted one another in bridging the cultural gap &amp; enhancing one another's performances.  I am disappointed to read about people's comparison of this movie with Dances With Wolves.  If people's tendency is to compare this movie with that and so forth, movie industry would have come to a close long time ago as why should people cough out money to watch a movie that is almost identical to the movie that they watched before?  I have enormous respect for Tom Cruise as he's a focused and dedicated actor.  Moreover, he's almost universally known as a generous actor too.  Whilst Tom was shooting in New Zealand location, he had interacted with the local community by calling a local radio station &amp; donating resources to charity.  That's what I call star quality.  Anyhow, this movie is very well-done as the production crew took the best element from their location shots particularly in those old shrines in Himeji &amp; Kyoto, Japan; New Zealand.  Japanese cast is superb namely Ken Watanabe who lost out on Oscar's Best Supporting Actor Award.  He definitely lifted this movie to another level by giving it a much needed weight, presence, &amp; charisma and no wonder his samurais followed him to the shadow of death as long as honour is restored.  The documentary about samurais in the second disc is very informative.  It wanted the viewers to decide for themselves if this movie is pure Hollywood or historical fact.  At the end of the day, it's a bit of both.  The anchor said it well that in real life, the samurais would be considered the renegade, the dinasours that refused to give in to the fact that their time had passed and that they refused to move on with time.  They were supposed to be the &quot;baddies&quot; in the movie as they fought against the Government which would like to implement change for the betterment of Japanese society.  Moreover, what about the caste system that they implemented in their own village?  As I was in Japan, I always wondered if the change that the Government enforced is necessarily better for its society?  I also wondered how practical it would be should samurais are still roaming Japan and every time they step into the railway station, all people would kneel down and avoiding eye contact and they would cut the innocents if they get in their ways somehow?  In some ways, I miss Japan of the old as any industrial cities nowadays look almost similar to each other.  Still, we have to come to terms that time changes everything.  Anyhow, a very well-made and touching movie that shouldn't be missed.  Highly recommended</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTSOBAPOWT3.html">A1ZTSOBAPOWT3</a><br/><p>A drunken Civil War hero, Capt.

It is a world that was slowly dying out as more and more Japanese people turned to living in the Western traditions, and for one US Military Captain, it showed him a world he grew to respect and love.....<br /><br />Tom Cruise stars as Nathan Algren, a captain sent to the foreign land of Japan to teach Japanese soldiers the way to fight as US troops do in America. The preparation is needed to stop a rebellion of Samurai warriors led by Katsumoto [played by Ken Watanabe] who have been attacking railroads and supply trains.<br /><br />After being sent to the front lines with troops he believes aren't ready to fight yet, Algren is captured after a battle and is brought to the village of Katsumoto's brother in the mountains. Despite some harsh attempts of getting used to the lifestyle of the Samurai, Algren slowly but surely learns how to love the Samurai lifestyle and how they work day and night.<br /><br />The movie shows us breath taking landscape shots of the mountains the Samurai live in. It even shows some great rain storm scenes as Algren attempts to prove himself by battling in a swordfight with one of the experienced Samurai and refuses to stay down no matter how many times he is knocked down.<br /><br />This movie also comes with some great fighting style scenes. With the fog war near the beginning in which Algren is captured after his inexperience troops are cut down by the Samurai, to a Ninja attack on the Samurai village where the samurai sacrifice themselves to save Katsumoto, to even Algren siding with Katsumoto for the climactic battle in the end against his fellow officers.<br /><br />This movie is great in so many ways: The vibrant color of the scenery, the style of fighting is smooth yet terrifying as lots of men die, and even the dialogue between Algren and Katsumoto is great as they have their "Many Conversations."<br /><br />I reccomend this movie if you really want to see a story of a man who realizes what he really wants for himself in this world.........</p></br><a href="../users/A1HO9J4DCQDGP9.html">A1HO9J4DCQDGP9</a><br/><p>Set in 1870's Japan, `The Last Samurai' is the story Japan's struggle to come to terms with the modern world whilst at the same time embracing its traditional past.<br /><br />Tom Cruise gives a surprisingly good performance as the tormented Nathan Algren, a former captain of the US army who is having trouble with his conscience, unusual in a white man in the 19th century but he is haunted by his past, a past which saw him play a role in the slaughter of innocent Native American men, women and children in his own country.<br /><br />Algren eventually agrees to go to Japan to help train its soldiers in the ways of modern warfare so that the nation's leaders can take on and destroy the sole remnants of the Samurai forces that are still clinging to the old ways.  Algren takes on this task for money and no other reason, he does not care about anything or anyone, death is no longer something he fears and it is partly this lack of fear that saves his life when he is captured by the `enemy,' who take him to their camp and inadvertently bring him spiritually closer to the way of the Samurai.<br /><br />Algren slowly falls under the spell of the Samurai Code of Honour and he eventually switches his allegiance in battle, ending up fighting with the Samurai against the people he was brought over to train.<br /><br />He forges a tenuous relationship with Taka, the widow of the man he killed in battle, and becomes a father figure to her two young sons and wins the grudging respect of the Samurai sword trainer who tries to break his spirit and his bones.<br /><br />The film does to a certain extent become a study in redemption as Algren strives to find his place in the scheme of things and to erase the guilt of his dishonourable past actions.  Eventually though Algren comes to realise he cannot erase the past, he can either live with it or let it crush him.<br /><br />He chooses to live but only as a Samurai, and that could mean his death at any given moment.<br /><br />The whole film was a vibrant, violent, passionate look into a past that Japan has never been able to reclaim since the days of the Samurai.  With the western world on the doorstep trying to force their way in, Japan had to let go of some of her ancient traditions to survive and in doing so lost a big part of herself.<br /><br />The Last Samurai has been accused of being too much on the side of the Samurai, but I think it manages to find a kind of balance, with both good and bad on both sides, and the over all film certainly deserves the five stars I am giving it.<br /><br />Cruise does well not to fluff the Japanese language too much in the movie, I liked that they used subtitles, it gave the movie considerable authenticity, and the fight scenes as gory as they were, were breathtaking to watch, along with a fabulous musical score and scenery that I can't even do justice to in this critique.<br /><br />A movie I will be watching again I think, because you cannot honestly take everything in, in just one viewing.<br /><br />By far one of the best movies to come out of 2003 in my opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGB4HN3QCGAL.html">A3DGB4HN3QCGAL</a><br/><p>I missed seeing The Last Samurai in the theatre but decided to buy a copy anyway because it looked good in the ads and the write-ups I'd read.<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays the role of Captain Nathan Algren, former Indian fighter in the U.S. Army (bits of this are shown in flashbacks)now a pathetic drunken loser reduced to giving sales demonstrations of Winchester rifles.<br /><br />He's contacted by a former associate and takes on the job of instructing the newly formed Japanese Imperial Army. The story is set in 1876 or so at a time of great change in Japan, the forces of modernization fast pacing Japan into the modern age. Part of this mission involves rooting out the last Samurai holdouts. Algren leads his recruits into battle, his recruits are massacred and after a valiant fight he is captured by the very man he is supposed to deal with. Taken to the Samurai village as a prisoner Algren gradually learns their ways, even learns to respect them. Algren eventually, after failing to reintegrate with his own people (and the dishonorable Japanese modernizers who I wanted to see get killed),joins with the Samurai in a battle to the death with the new Imperial Army. This is of course a slaughter with swords & spears against rifles & Gatling guns. The Imperial soldiers are so shamed by what they've done that they refuse an order to kill Algren and the Emperor strips the chief "New Japan" leader of everything he has.<br /><br />You never really learn what happens to Algren, it seems he goes back to the stronghold and the lead Samurai's widow, but that is presented as maybe he did, who knows?<br /><br />I thought the story was interesting, Cruise did a good job, but something was lacking- I'm not sure what. The costumes/ weapons were great, most of the sets/ locations were too ( a real sense of being in Japan)I just needed something more. Some of the extras are very interesting, I liked learning about how things were built or designed. The section about the film's Premiere in Japan was alright with the Japanese cast giving their thought's about the show although I thought the " I like Tom Cruise" stuff was a little to strong,the History Channel mini-documentary was too Cruise-ey for my taste as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>What we should appreciate before we get too deep into the odd story of Captain Algren is that he/it is strikingly similar to John Blackthorne, the English pilot of a Dutch ship that ends up in Japan in Clavell's near genius-like rendition of &quot;Shogun.&quot;<p>Without discrediting Tom Cruise who acted brillinatly I thought, the story does live up to general aspects of the &quot;Shogun&quot; tale but falls short in  a few other areas. The love affair with Cruise and Taka is sweet but with Blackthorne and Mariko it was detailed, passionate, forbidden and conspiratorial.<p>Likewise, the transition that Cruise makes into Japanese society is in fact, believable however it seems to happen swiftly. Too swiftly to remain completely credible. The script and Cruise's voiceover explains his love of the discipline and simplicity, which interestingly enough is what seduces Blackthorne. Well. Really seduces Blackthorne. But then again, it is Nathan that/who becomes a true warrior, and I must again give kudos to Cruise who appears believable in the great physicality of the Bushido spirit and the battle scenes.<p>All in all a nice ride, sufficient enough to take it out of the 'manly men doing manly things' genre and allow you to think.<p>Ken Wanatabe as Katsumoto is excellent and should have won him a best supporting. Taka is wonderful; the children are animated and innocent. The use of Cruise speaking Japanese was an excellent touch and again, seemed to add credibility. I should also mention that there are similar 'blood lines' in the Indian Rights oriented &quot;A Man Called Horse,&quot; less interesting, less fulfilling, but possibly equally provacative. <p>Good job to all. 5 stars.

Wait, am I talking about a Tom Cruise movie? Why yes! And what a refreshing, vibrant, and even spiritual film this is. Through the movie's somewhat formulaic plot of the washed-up war hero with skeletons in the closet coming to learn the way of the samurai is a movie done truly in a classic Hollywood fashion. John Toll's cinematography is tear-inducingly brilliant in every frame, Hanz Zimmer's lush score proves haunting, and even Mr. Cruise creates a stunning, believable character arc as Nathan Algren, imprisoned by his samurai enemies, but eventually in love with the beauty and the legend of the art. There were elements of the film I wanted to dislike: Algren's voice-over narration that slides occasionally into cliche, the film's Hollywood ending, and a third act that begins to test patience. But Samurai is such an immensely satisfying experience (especially in its quaint, beautiful midsection where Algren comes to accept his destiny as a warrior) that those things become mere quibbles along the way. I can't say that Samurai is a masterpiece on par with even the slightest of the great samurai films, but it evokes a fondness for filmmaking to which I wish more filmmakers, like Zwick, would return more often. It's long, it's epic, it's a tear-jerker, and the battle scenes are so alive you have to blink twice. Call me a sucker for loving this beautiful, flawed movie, but try to resist it yourself. It's simply futile.

However, Nathan's past precedes him as his services are requested in Japan in order to squelch a rebellion by the few Samurai that holds on to the old traditions and who believe that the changes in Japan are moving too rapidly.  In Nathan's first battle with the enemy he is captured by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), the leader of the rebellion, who intends to study Nathan as he wants to learn more about his enemy.  This leads to a mutual respect and discovery of wisdom for both Nathan and Katsumoto as they both deepen their enlightenment of Bushido.  Nonetheless, the mutual understanding between the two warriors has set them on a path of righteousness and honor that has been challenged by the Japanese rule.  This means that the two men must live by the warrior code, which can mean certain death.  Last Samurai is a story that fuses Western values with Eastern values, but both value sets are still intact as they merge.  Zwick leaves the audience with a heroic tale about sacrifice, honor, friendship, love, and commitment that offers a noble cinematic experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A16FUU8WW76QFY.html">A16FUU8WW76QFY</a><br/><p>'The Last Samurai' is yet another 'White Stranger in a Strange Land ' story.  The film has many similarities to Kevin Costner's 'Dances With Wolves' (noted by other astute reviewers); the Civil War is major factor in both central character's state of mind.  Both men choose to side with the natives, rather than the exploitative European culture that spawned them.  Like 'Wolves', this film is bloody and beautifully shot, with large battle sequences.<p>The supporting cast is excellent, with Ken Watanabe simply marvelous as the Samurai Leader, Katsumoto.  I found myself wondering just how this film would have played without the Tom Cruise character- I think just terrific, and would have been solely from the Japanese point of view.  I am dreaming here - Cruise shares producing credits, and the film probably would not have been made without his star power behind it.  Nevertheless, one does get tired of these movies with the 'Great White Hope' leading the way for the natives.<p>The one area I have real doubts about is how quickly the Samurai were to accept a Westerner into their insular society in the film.  This really stretches the imagination - even today, Japan is not exactly eager to bring foreigners within it's inner circles.  Japan was a VERY closed society in 1876, yet we are to believe that the Cruise character literally becomes one of them in a matter of months!<p>The film is beautiful to watch, with spectacular action and realistic battle scenes.  In spite of the obvious plot flaws, the film takes the opportunity to teach the viewer about Japanese culture; one sees the impact on future events (WWII and the Bushido Code, for example).  The final battle is inspiring, with the Spartan stand at Thermopylae being used to rally the Samurai against a clearly superior enemy.<p>All in all, 'The Last Samurai' was enjoyable in spite of it's Hollywood origins.  The whole idea of Tom Cruise as an adopted Japanese Samurai warrior really is farfetched, but somehow I left this film still impressed.  What it really comes down to is the supporting cast - they carried the film.  'Samurai' is really about Japan, and the Japanese actors did themselves and director Ed Zwick proud!</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>Many of the reviewers liken this movie to "Dances With Wolves" but though there are some similiarites, the main difference is in the main character played by Tom Cruise. I'm not always an avid fan of him and that has nothing to do with his Scientology views but this ranks as one of his best performances as a damaged Civil War vet who regains a sense of self when he encounters the Japanese culture--in particular, bushido.  Ken Watanabe is also excellent in his first starring English role and I think he was nominated for an Oscar if I'm not mistaken.  Being Asian I was entranced by Zwick's sensitive direction and also by the stunning photography.  If you can get this in Hi-Def (HD-DVD or Blu-ray), I would recommend it particularly since the HD DVD price is below $10!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>'The Last Samurai' is a one of those films that has it's flaws but you can't help but enjoy anyway. This film follows Cruise's character as he is captured by a Samurai clan and then learns the lifestyle and ways of a Samurai whilst living in their village. Throughout the story it immerses you in aspects of the history of Japan, and although slightly stylised, gives a good feeling of life and culture in those times. It has beautiful film locations, beautiful music, a good story line and a good cast. I feel this to be one of Cruise's better films and his performance is very credible. This film may be slightly long, but it holds your interest right to the end and is a great nights viewing. Well worth considering.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/AMNNPDX9MFEUD.html">AMNNPDX9MFEUD</a><br/><p>Critics of The Last Samurai point out its obvious historically inaccuracies, the cheap ending, the tired plot already beaten to death before its predecessor Dances with Wolves stamped on the carcass, and the negative liberal view of the white man's legacy. All of these are valid points, but they lack support in light of the countless historical revisions filmed over the decades. One need only go back before the dawn of political correctness to see evidence of the contrary view of history; God-fearing white folk trying to scrape out a living on the frontier despite the devilish torment of the savage Injuns or white crusaders for Christ bringing salvation to the ignorant heathens beyond our shores. For the older among you who take exception to movies like The Last Samurai, Dances with Wolves, et al, I suggest you watch Birth of a Nation for some needed balance.<br />Furthermore, this movie never claims to be based on facts, so criticizing it for failing to represent history is the weak tool of conservatives too blinded by their own belief that America can do no wrong. These narrow-minded fools are no better than their self-righteous America-bashing adversaries. Somewhere in the middle lies reality.<br />The Last Samurai is an epic drama that focuses on the changes in a world, in a nation, and in a man. Troubled by his own violent past, Captain Algren (Tom Cruise in his limited, grinning, wide-eyed fashion) is the man who finds peace and forgiveness within himself through forced tenure among the Japanese in a Samurai village in 1876. The need for Cruise's character is debatable because the story of old ways coming to their end at the hands of dubious progress is worthy in and of itself, but this is a Hollywood movie and the movie never hides from its intended audience. The real treasure is in the sweeping scope of the cinematography, the insight to a way of life dramatically different from our own, powerful performances from the largely Japanese cast, an emotional score, and yes, the message, heavy-handed though it is.<br />Hollywood and history make for strange bedfellows, be it Jesus Christ or the Roman Empire, Jesse James or Wyatt Earp, Hollywood never takes on a historical character or movement it can't bring sympathy to using self-indulgent poetic license. Were it not morally reprehensible, they'd probably manage to make a compassionate film about the Nazis....if they haven't already.<br />There aren't a lot of great epic movies made because the balance between grandeur and excess or drama and action is perilous to maintain. The Last Samurai is worth the lengthy investment of time for the stirring emotional outpouring it wrenches from those willing to excuse the flaws and occasional cloying misstep.</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe star in this 2003 war drama.<br />During the Civil War, A Captain meets a Samurai Leader<br />and learns from him.

It's 1876, bare months after Custer's Last Stand, and Capt. Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), a survivor of the Seventh Cavalry, is working as a huckster for the Winchester rifle company and doing his best to drown himself in drink.  Like Frank Hopkins of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMOW">Hidalgo (Widescreen Edition)</a>, he's tormented by memories of an attack on a camp of peaceable Indians--and quite ready to kill the C.O. (Tony Goldwyn) who ordered it.  When his old sergeant, Zebulon Gant (Billy Connelly), finds him and suggests the existence of a job just suited to him, he's intrigued, but his old Colonel's presence on the team does nothing for his enthusiasm.  The money does: $500 a month to travel to Japan, where the young Emperor Meiji (Shichinosuke Nakamura) has embarked upon a program to unify his country and bring in Western technology, and there help train the Imperial Army to fight a rebellious Samurai lord named Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe).  The Army turns out to be a ragtag band of conscripts that breaks in terror when it first faces the rebels, leaving Algren and Gant virtually alone, and when Gant is killed Algren goes berserk.  Katsumoto is deeply impressed by his fighting, and when Algren collapses, wounded and exhausted, he refuses to permit the American to be slain; instead, he takes him along as a prisoner, hoping to "understand our new enemy."  Slowly recovering his strength in the Samurai stronghold, Algren is at first little impressed by the Samurai ethos, but slowly he begins to realize the genuineness of their dedication and spirituality; always a quick study, he learns to speak Japanese and becomes so expert with the wooden practice swords that he fights Katsumoto's best warrior, Ujio (Jiroyuki Sanada), to a draw; and slowly he begins to understand that the Samurai, like the Indians, are fighting for their way of life.  A strange friendship grows up between him and Katsumoto, and Algren also finds himself attracted to his host's sister, whose husband he killed in the battle.  When the Emperor offers Katsumoto a safe-conduct to Tokyo, Algren goes there with him and is ready to leave the country, but on learning that the Samurai has been arrested and condemned to death, he engineers a daring plan to free him, and joins him in one last glorious but futile stand against the forces of modernity.<br /><br />Algren isn't always a likeable character, but he's very human and comprehensible, and Cruise portrays with sensitivity and believability his slow conversion to the Samuari cause.  (The film is based on fact: curious viewers might want to consult Wikipedia's article on the Meiji Restoration to see how it all began and what effects it had on later Japanese history, including the country's character today.)  Hans Zimmer's thunderous score <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DZTIW">The Last Samurai</a> and the excellently choreographed duel and battle scenes are pluses, and while the movie is rated R for violence, discreet and creative camerawork prevents any really shocking or disgusting sequences.  This "romantic vision of a lost world," as Time Magazine called it, will impress you and stay with you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>The story follows a disillusioned American Civil War hero, Captain Nathan Algren, played by Tom Cruise, as he goes to Tokyo to train the Japanese army, who are embroiled in a battle with the remaining traditional Samurai. The Americans are there for the money, and that money is provided by the Emperor's Westernized advisors who want the Samurai out of the picture so that they may continue be the power behind the Emperor and increases their own wealth. In an early battle however, Algren is captured by the Samurai and held by them for the winter. During this time he learns the way of the Samurai and eventually ends up fighting alongside them - breaking his allegiance to the country he once fought for.<br /><br />Ken Watanabe in his performance as the samurai leader Katsumoto dominates the screen. Through Watanabe we see that the samurai are noble and intelligent. Hiroyuki Sanada was impressive as Ujio, the tough, brutal, yet loyal and disciplined Samurai.<br /><br />This film has amazing sets and battles. The sword fights are well rehearsed and the cinematography is well orchestrated. The costumes were striking and good replicas for a period movie. This film reminded me of Dances with wolves, which I also liked. Its not about which culture is more superior, it is about our mutual willingness to listen and learn from each other.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B8GXSCB1R05T.html">A2B8GXSCB1R05T</a><br/><p>"The Last Samurai" is an excellent film, respectful of its source material even while telling a fictional story.  The "foreigner joins a warrior culture, taking on their strange dress and winning their respect" story is well-represented on film and in history, from Bonnie Prince Charlie to "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Dances with Wolves," as well as the Japanese-themed "Shogun," which is based on the life of Miura Anjin/William Adams.  Here, Tom Cruise is the stranger in a strange land, and the Samurai of Japan are the warrior culture. <p>Being no stranger to Samurai films of Japanese history, I was pleased by all aspects of "The Last Samurai."  Both the modernizing Meji government and the past-looking Samurai of the period are well represented, although the Samurai come out looking much better.  The warrior code of Bushido is not explained, and the lifestyle is completely romanticized, yet this is a movie and not a history text.  Emperor Meji is well-played, which surprised me.  He is neither hero nor villain.  And there are ninjas, which improves every film.<p>In the vein of the big Hollywood epics, "The Last Samurai" serves up healthy doses of sweeping score, beautiful vistas and Japan-landscape eye candy.  The country has rarely looked so beautiful, although I bet some technicians spent plenty of time computer-erasing the omni-present power lines.  The samurai armor,while not historically accurate, looks beautiful on film.  There are more than a few scenes that leap beautifully from a Kurosawa flick.  A great looking cast helps as well.<p>To this day, Japan has difficulty rationalizing tradition and modernization, as can be seen in books such as "Dogs and Demons."  "The Last Samurai" has some good lessons for modern Japan, and some good entertainment for us all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ.html">A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ</a><br/><p>I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan, but I can't think of anyone else who could have done as well in this movie.

The Last Samurai is. Historical? Hardly. Take a few grains: yes, Samurai existed in Japan as an ancient, militaristic culture, a law unto themselves, & Japan was opening itself up to the west at the time of the movie (1876). Aside from that... Cruise is an emotionally damaged hero of the civil & Indian wars. He is contracted to whip the Japanese army into a fighting force. Who is the enemy? The Samurai, who are much admired & feared through-out Japan. They refuse to surrender to modernity & give up their way of life. In battle he is captured by the Samurai. Their leader is played very well by Ken Watenabe. He is impressed by Cruise's fighting skills & spares him. Can you guess the rest? Of course. It's right out of Dances with Wolves but probably less accurate. While a prisoner he adopts the Samurai lifestyle.  Oh the pain, the inner conflict, the over-acting. I said it was a GOOD movie (C+). That's it. The Samurai are doomed, destroyed by time  more than anything else. Well done battle scenes. Lots of really good extras in this two disc set. Cruise is really charismatic & likeable in the extensive interviews he gave. He put a lot of time & effort into this movie. Lots of background & interviews with other principals. They even had The History Channel episode History or Hollywood? about the movie & the "history" behind it. In some ways the extras are better than the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A5KLP39OKXD5P.html">A5KLP39OKXD5P</a><br/><p>Well, I remember the first time I came across this film when my school decided to take the senior boys to the movie, I being one of them those days. 'Last Samurai'. I was absolutely tantalized by the direction, by the beautifull scenario of Japan in the 19th Century, the war, etc. This film unlike many other battle and war oriented films is very very different and its not just the war or the battle sequences that overwhelmes your mind completely., I emphasize that! its also the emotional bond between each charecter. Ken Wantanbe and Tom Cruise were excellent and yes 'Taka' the sweet and beautifull sister of Wantanbe, how could I ever forget her. I am glad I got the movie finally on a DVD.

It stars Tom Cruise, but to me he was not the star of the film. I feel that the movie had most of its power from the supporting actor Ken Watanabe. The way that he acted throughout the movie could give him the Oscar in the Best Supporting Actor Catagory. The entire movie could win many different awards, and I'm glad that Tom Cruise was not nominated, because I have seen him in much better roles, like "Minority Report," or "Vanilla Sky." His great scene comes towards the end, where he gives emotion and power at once.<p>Cruise plays Captain Nathan Algren, a Civil War hero who loves to drink. He's recently come from battling American Indians in the west, and often had bad memories of what took place during those battles. But Algren gets a job when Japanese businessman Omura wants him to train the new army, with somebody that he knows Bagley. Bagley wants Algren because of the way that he battled the Indians. Algren agrees when he is able to bring his fellow Army fighter Sergeant Zebulon Gant. When they make it to Japan, they are met by the translator Simon Graham, and they begin to train the troops for battle. But Omura wants them to fight the samurai and their leader Katsumoto right away, and overrules Algren causing him to take his inexperienced troops to battle the Katsumoto. Algren is almost killed during the battle, but taken back to Katsumoto's village, which is ruled by his son. Algren is trapped, and there is no way for him to be able to return back to Japan. While with Katsumoto, he learns all about the way of the samurai and he finds out that there is nothing wrong with the people that Omura wants to kill. But it also becomes clear that Bagley is getting ready to fight. Algren befriends Katsumoto, and the two learn that they have much more in common then they oringally thought, and it becomes clear to Algren what he must do.<p>"The Last Samurai" was a beautiful film. It had a beautiful sceney, beautiful action, some beautiful acting, and beautiful direction. I really did love it, and I am including it on the best of 2004, only beause I saw it at the very beginning of this year. This is one of those movies that you have to see in the theatre, otherwise it is not going to be an good. It is a big screen movie, and I have a feeling that I would have been disappointed if I saw it on video first. Try and see it now, before it totally disappears.<p>ENJOY!<p>Rated R for strong violence and battle sequences.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>Being that this film is based on actual historical occurences it could've been the typical Hollywood silliness extraordinaire complete with massive innacuracies, tons of cheese and syrup, and a dishwashed script.<p>  Incredibly, most of the above was avoided with the exception maybe of the historical innacuracies but even those coul've been severe and they weren't.<p>  As the plot has been detailed by other reviewers I'll stick to the impression this film leaves you with. The "Last Samurai" is actually a pretty cool flick. The theme (encountered in other older films as well) of the westerner who goes over to Asia with the mindset of a clueless brute only to be engulfed by the age-old philosophy he comes in contact with there is well in effect here and it works like a dandy.<p>  Cruise gives his usual very good performance but the show is actually stolen by the Japanese cast headed by the "Katsumoto" character (the Samurai leader) who's simply a treat to watch.<p>  There is loads of battling in vast open fields and a lot of gore that accompanies it, and these escenes are absolutely great. The martian arts choreography is excellent and the filming is impeccable as well.<p>  But what makes the film really tick are the sequences where after Cruise has been captured by the Samurai he has long and intriguing conversations with Katsumoto while at the same time he's trying to come to grips with a culture he not only doesnt understand but which charms him to death. These sequences are the top stuff this film has to offer and it does so with style.<p>  While the Last Samurai does remind of the Lord of the Rings when it comes to the spectacular battle scene and it equally reminds of Braveheart with the super-underdogs taking on bravely the hordes of mechanised soldiers sent by the emperor to crush their rebellion it still maintains a life and heart of its own and keeps you hooked till the end which is (sadly)predictable, conventional and somewhat corny.<p>  That, along with the fact that it is probably 20 minutes too long are the only minuses i could attribute to it. Sure, this is Hollywood spreading cliches again, as the Samurai werent as noble as they are usually portrayed since they mindlessly accepted any order coming from the emperor and that included massacring "opponents" at his order regardless of guilt or innocence. But this type of cliche was to be expected.<p>  Overall though, this is a probably unexpectedly cool film. Definately recommended, allthough if you see it on a small screen you'll be inevitably missing out on the great photography and camera work, but most importnatly the stunning combat scenes, many of which are shot aereally.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Recipe for instant Tom Cruise samurai flick: Take your basic samurai period drama, insert Tom Cruise, and water down liberally. Stir in cliches and do not season at all. The result? "The Last Samurai," a very dull, colorless action flick set in Japan. It's not a good sign when the New Zealand scenery is the most striking thing about the whole thing.<br /><br />It's the mid-1800s and times are a-changin' in Japan -- the modernization of the west (meaning the USA) is sweeping away the old ways. The Emperor gets an American veteran named Nathan Algren to help train his troops. Algren is an alcoholic, filled with angst because he killed American Indians, and he hates his new job.<br /><br />Suddenly he's captured during an attack by samurai Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) and dragged back to his village. After going cold turkey, he begins to appreciate the old samurai code and ways, and begins to fall in love with a beautiful widow. Taking the side of his new allies, he sets out on a seemingly doomed attack, against the very people he was sent to help... and his own troops.<br /><br />Even taken out of the historical context, "Last Samurai" is a deeply annoying film. It's laced with heavy-handed political correctness, complete with pointless insertions about American Indians and Custer. It's also  saddled with a surreally optimistic ending. Everying about it -- from Cruise's love interest to his change of heart -- is predictable, cliched and very corny.<br /><br />While the film is SET in Japan, the actual shooting took place in New Zealand, giving it a lush, almost fantastical backdrop for all the action. Certainly it makes director Edward Zwick's job a bit easier, even if the film is saddled with some very stilted dialogue. ("And though it may forever be obscure to me, I cannot but be aware of its power.") And enough with the "Bob" comments.<br /><br />Tom Cruise shows little emotion, and his character's alcoholic angst is almost laughably contrived. In fact, you may cheer when he gets beaten up. Ken Watanabe is what makes the film -- he has the presence of a future screen legend, and he plays Katsumoto with vulnerabilities and real feelings. This guy deserves to be the lead of such a film. Koyuki also shows incredible expressiveness as the widow Taka.<br /><br />For a well-acted, well-directed film that happens to be set in Japan, check out the immortal samurai films by Kurosawa. Even merely taken on its own, "Last Samurai" is swamped in its own sense of self-importance. Watanabe and New Zealand are the best things about this film.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>I wrote a couple of lengthy reviews of this film, criticizing the romanticizing of the Bushido code and other aspects of this film.  For reasons unknown to me, Amazon declined to publish them.  So I will be brief:<br /><br />This is a film for all those (and judging by my reading of Amazon reviews: they are legion) who loathe America and love a romanticized and fictitious culture peopled with wise and far nobler folks than we crass capitalists.  It is a false, pernicious, and short-sighted view of the world, history and the achievements and failings of human beings everywhere.  But it has a vast and gullible audience that eats it up. So, indulge yourselves once more.<br /><br />Every culture and all people everywhere have their glories, delights, and their failings and shames.  God knows that is as true of Japanese history and culture as well as it is of American! The film deplores American cruelty and completely overlooks the cruelty inherent in the Bushido code and what it  meant to the peoples conquered by the Japanese.  This is not only biased, it is downright dishonest.<br /><br />But, I make too much of what is typical Hollywood romanticized pap!  It looks pretty, it was well-made, the art direction was fine, and the performances were tolerable.

He &quot;goes Indian&quot;. <p>As this film opens in 1876, ex-Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), formerly of the 7th Cavalry, is an alcoholic Civil War and Plains Indian War veteran reduced to making public appearances on behalf of the Winchester Arms Company, maker of the famous repeating rifle. He's rescued by his old commanding officer, Col. Benjamin Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), who arranges for Algren to help train the Japanese Imperial Army in modern warfare techniques. The pay is $500 per month. Because of an incident in the campaign against the Indians that still causes Algren nightmares, cost him his self-perceived honor, and drove him to drink, Nathan tells his ex-CO that he'll kill anyone in Japan for $500 a month, but would gladly kill Bagley for free. Army camaraderie is not all it's cracked up to be. In any case, off both sail to Japan.<p>The Imperial government is bedeviled by rebel samurai warriors cranky about the increasing Westernization of society. In the first skirmish between Algren-trained troops and a samurai band led by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), Nathan is wounded and captured. He spends the winter in Katsumoto's village, where he's nursed back to health by Katsumoto's sister, Taka (Koyuki), whose husband Algren had killed in the recent battle. While a prisoner, Nathan discovers love with you-know-who and personal friendship with Katsumoto, whose life he saves at one point, and re-discovers Honor through proximity with and training in the Samurai Code. In the final confrontation between the samurai and Imperial troops led by Bagley, guess where Algren plants his standard? It's DANCES WITH WOLVES all over again, but without the wolf. The samurai even employ bows and arrows.<p>THE LAST SAMURAI is a well-acted, engaging story that's shot in some beautiful scenery. Since New Zealand seems to be the location of moviemakers' choice lately (LOTR trilogy, PETER PAN), I wasn't surprised to see in the ending credits that some of this film, presumably that part in the samurai village, was located there. And speaking of scenery, there's Koyuki, a Japanese actress  unknown on U.S. screens, who's exquisite.<p>Unfortunately, the film is perhaps thirty minutes too long, and the climactic battle sequence is milked for all it's worth - and then some - including some unnecessary slo-mo footage. The term &quot;maudlin&quot; comes to mind. And it's this aspect of THE LAST SAMURAI which makes it, to me, inferior to that other action epic of 2003, the more tightly edited MASTER AND COMMANDER.<p>THE LAST SAMURAI may win some Oscars, such as for cinematography or costuming. But, I perceive it as only one of the better films of 2003 as opposed to one of the best.</p></br><a href="../users/A32K4BV5DFG3KP.html">A32K4BV5DFG3KP</a><br/><p>I began this movie thinking that it was just another vehicle for Tom Cruise, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised to find a real movie. The character development is a bit loose and had somewhat of a rushed feeling. The story sometimes came off as unbelievable or inconsistent, for instance the first battle where Tom Cruise is captured really does not connect to the other part of the story. Tom being wounded defeats several samurai warriors, later his fighting skills were shown to be much more inept compared to the samurai. This did not seem consistent to me. The Japanese Emperor not knowing what to do and playing both sides of the fence seemed a bit unbelievable.<br /><br />You get the feeling that the reason why Ken Wantanabe's character respects Tom Cruise so much, is because that they both were tortured battle tired warriors. Overall, I did enjoy this film. It does have some beautiful cinematography. Nevertheless, the violence is extremely graphic and there are some scenes where Tom Cruise is drying out from alcoholism.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>Many people say that Tom Cruse is unconvincing or overrated. I am now convinced that these people have seen neither this film or Collateral. This is a heart-felt, pure epic of sorts which are very rare in this day and age. This film follows a sad storyline of fighting for tradition and avoiding judging anyone until you meet them. This movie is filled with breath-taking scenary of the Japanese landscapes, and riveting battle sequences. Films of this caliber are very rare.<br /><br />*9* (A)</p></br><a href="../users/A1N0LCPR7O7OLL.html">A1N0LCPR7O7OLL</a><br/><p>Started out kinda shaky...Honestly almost turned it off but Cruise's performance held my interest so I kept watching.  Thank God I did because it really is a good film.  Sure there are a lot of bad things some people could say about it just to be mean - I hated a lot of the editing in the beginning and that goofy fat guy from Harry Potter Prisoner From Azkaban is terrible in it (most people I know just can't stand Tom Cruise - which is unfortunate because he is  a MUCH better actor than most people give him credit for).  The whole movie is carefully balanced by tremendous action sequences in the middle and final section of the film and the sympathetic Japanese characters (Watanabe, the love interest, the kids etc...). They are all so believable and easy to connect to.  Some of the negative reviews on here (Amazon) are criticizing Cruise's performance harshly and the role his character plays in influencing the samurai/japanese people etc...Really it is Cruise's character though who learns in this movie and not the other way around which the trailer for this film so mistakenly conveyed...And unfortunately prevented me from seeing it in the theater.  And believe me when I say that I am the LAST person to want to see some movie about a "white man" (let alone one of the biggest american movie stars in the world) showing some bada#$ "samurai" how its done in the skills of fighting...But the film works people.  It isn't Gladiator or Braveheart but the characters are interesting and compelling, and many of the action sequences are truly suspenseful and entertaining...Even rousing at times.  The biggest problem I had with it was the opening (for awhile it was beginning to feel like a poor man's version of "Glory" - a perfect film in my mind which Edward Zwick also directed).  This isn't "Glory" but it isn't bad either.  Cruise is one of the best actors out there I've decided after watching this film.  People like calling him a "vanity" actor because he's such a major star and that he does roles that are in most cases larger than life...But what actor out there can honestly say they don't want that?  And besides he has done a wide array of roles and is surprisingly transformational...I say "surprisingly" simply because more people don't want to admit or recognize it...Think about how different he is in this from Born On The Fourth Of July or Collateral or Eyes Wide Shut or Color Of Money or Magnolia or Minority Report...The guy has some serious range people.  Don't be jealous 'cuz he's rich and good looking and has worked with some of the best directors ever (i.e. Oliver Stone, Kubrick, Spielberg, Scorsese, Brian De Palma, Tony Scott, Michael Mann).  Life's too short for that kinda talk people. Admit the truth...Tom Cruise is a beast of an actor and he deserves all the fame he's received whether you want to admit it or not.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>In the last few years, epics have seen an amazing resurgence, climaxing in the classic "Lord of the Rings" trilogy.  And most of the other epics have been staisfying as well, with "Gladiator" being but one standout.  But the Tom Cruise vehicle "The Last Samurai" it not one of the them.  Problems here start with the films bankable star.  The role of Nathan Algren is a challenging one, with emotional torture brewing behind his eyes and a sullen demanor in his walk.  But moments where Cruise hits these needed traits are few and far between.  Cruise plays Algren as a statue who poses as a heroic monolith for the camera, in other words Algren comes off as other characters Cruise has played in the past.  The only actor who stands out is Ken Watanabe, a Japanese actor who makes his english languange debut.  He brings a sense of dignity and intensity to the character of Katsumoto, a Samurai leader who is the last of a dying breed and a dying code<br /><br />Perhaps you can blame the films' director, Edward Zwick (Legends of the Fall, The Siege).  Zwick lets the film drag between inspired moments and the whole film seems  overlong and ponderous, not to mention derivative.  Screenwriter John Logan (Gladiator, The Aviator) borrows one too many plot details from other films that came before him, especially "Dances With Wolves."  One tries to take the film on its own terms, but the similarities are too glaring.  Logan wanted the film to be a classic, but it falls far short.<br /><br />That's not to say the film does not have its merits, which why "The Last Samurai" is so frustrating to watch.  When it does get good, it's breathtaking.  The $120 million production is a visual feast, with beautiful sets juxtaposed seamlessly with sweeping locales in Japan and New Zealand.  The film's visual pedigree is furthured by the wondrous cinematography of John Toll.  Toll, a two-time academy award winner, is a master at what he does.  The film is gorgeously shot and the hectically edited battle scenes are given a sense of clarity and extra punch, especially when set to Hans Zimmers' muscular score.  One only wishes that the reat of the film lived up to this high standard.  It could have been one of the best epics ever.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N.html">A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N</a><br/><p>This film started out interesting and good,and then just became "Top Gun".While interesting historically,this film lacked everything else,and just followed the  basic "Hollywood" formula.It was also unrealistic to believe Tom Cruise's character(a troubled,raging alcoholic) could learn the art&skill of a Samuri Worrior in just a few short months of time.The film followed all the basic plot outlines of Top Gun,just like "Days of Thunder",and I was rolling my eyes towards the end.It sounds great on a home theater system,but this is'nt one I'd want to buy&keep forever.Buy&own at your own risk,but there are better Jappanese Samuri films out there like "The Seven Samuri".</p></br><a href="../users/A1EGDRTJYF3AZK.html">A1EGDRTJYF3AZK</a><br/><p>I rank this movie right up there with Braveheart and Gladiator as far as epics go. At first I thought this was going to be one of those "face time" movies just to get a paycheck for Tom Cruise, but to my suprise it was a great movie. While watching this movie I actually learned something, which I wasn't expecting, and that was that the samurai were alot like the native americans in the ways that they were removed from their own land.This is one of the best movies to come out in the last couple of years and a breath of fresh air compared to those movies like Master and Commander that claimed to be action movies but were really just "face time" for their leading man.</p></br><a href="../users/ATQTE464YAZM1.html">ATQTE464YAZM1</a><br/><p>I don't understand why people take this film so seriously, because I couldn't for the life of me. That is not to say the film is altogether bad...it offers some guilty pleasure action sequences, but then again that's all it can offer up. Considering what the producers had going into this, they really handled several issues in an amatuer fashion.<p>Let's take, for example, just the mere existance of Tom Cruise's character in the story. I can understand why Katsumoto spares him - the dream of the white tiger - although I pondered just how readily this culture of people (who only a decade ago murdered any foreign sailors shipwrecked on their island) could accept him so readily. And even then, he probably should have been more of an observer to the Japanese customs than a participant. Miyamoto Musashi spent his whole life realizing how to become a great warrior, but Tom Cruise's character manages to do it within six months. And please...you have GOT to be kidding me when he uses not only two swords at once, but two LONG swords at once! Not even the greatest samurai could do that, and there's a reason - it's practically impossible. And even if it is possible, you're telling me Tom Cruise has had that much training to do it? The scene where Katsumoto's son takes out a long sword and a short sword is more realistic, as samurai would do that so they could switch from one to the other, but people rarely used katanas in each hand. Oh yes, and I agree with other reviewers here...why does Tom Cruise take six or seven bullets to the torso come out perfectly fine, yet samurai take the same hits and die? <p>The character development for some people needed work as well. For example, the Irish sergeant that is Tom Cruise's lifelong friend gets killed by the samurai, and a samurai even gets off his horse and stabs the man in the stomach! Yet Tom Cruise forgets his friend and doesn't seem to mind the company of men who killed a man he knew longer than them - in fact we never hear of the Irish sergeant again. And the love story was so unnecessary and unrealistic. Tom Cruise kills the husband of Katsumoto's sister, she says to her nephew that he smells like pigs, and then five minutes later she's having feelings for him? And she actually falls in love with him, and her kids adore him? Why? Because he taught them baseball? I don't know about you, but a person who killed my dad would have to take a bullet for me before I even consider them a friend...let alone my new father. And Tom Cruise's old enemy, an American lieutenant colonel he used to serve under, doesn't do much except walk around and be evil. And what was the purpose of the ninjas, particularly the guy with the Gorbachev birthmark on his cheek? Why would a government leader so bent on stopping traditionalism employ ninjas, who historically sided with the Shogun...who was a SAMURAI! It's almost like they put them in just so they can say, "Hey! We have ninjas!"<p>I also took disliking to how INCOMPETANT they made the government characters. When they rescue Katsumoto they use arrows against the guards, which is fine except the guards seem to have a habit of running out into the open with their fronts to the archers, making themselves great targets. Also in the final battle the samurai lay a trap, and the American lieutenant colonel, suggests to send out skirmishers, to which a corrupt government official (who seems to be every where across Japan) simply says, "No need! Send the troops forward!" I might also add that the samurai trap for the government troops at the end is planned not by Katsumoto, but by Tom Cruise. Excuse me if I sound like I'm looking for an arguement, but can't the Japanese think on their own? This is the culture that produced Oda Nobunaga, Takeda Shingen, Admiral Togo, and even Admiral Yamamoto, yet it seems in this movie it's as if the idea of war is entirely new to them.<p>There are also a lot of historical inaccuracies in this film as well. For example, there was no lone samurai standing up against the government with less than 500 troops. In fact, the majority of samurai clans to the west supported the foreign traders and backed the Emperor. The Satsuma Rebellion in 1860's, led by the Satsuma and Chosun samurai clans, was the move to stop foreign intervention...but they at one point had an army as large as 40,000 soldiers. In fact, the army of Japan was fairly modernized by the time set in the film, and it was being led and instructed not by military leaders from America or any other foreign nation, but by fellow Japanese such as Aritomo Yamagata who travelled abroad in Europe studying the ways of the west. The only revolt against the government in 1876/1877 was by former army officer Takamori Saigo - and even though he did want to restore the use of samurai, he could bring up a force of 15,000 against the government and held a fairly modernized army, having served in the professional Japanese military - he also lost not in a grand charge but instead his fortress at Kagoshima. I also find it funny that the movie makes the samurai seem like a noble and proud people built on honor and dignity - they fail to mention according to the traditionalist laws a samurai could kill any peasant and get away with it, being of a higher class. The Emperor himself is portrayed as weak and under the influence of advisors, and while the Emperor was indeed surrounded by advisors and the Japanese government began to fall into an oligarchy, it was Emperor Meiji himself who revoked the samurai of their titles and stripped the Shogun of his power, replacing it more and more to his own stature. He was hardly the weak, indecisive ruler they portrayed in this movie, bending to the will of ONE government agent.<p>Oh yeah, and this has got to be "Dances With Wolves II: I'm Turning Japanese." I mean come on now, Tom Cruise has experience in both the Civil War and the Indian Wars, and he knows the Indians like he was one. It's almost like Kevin Costner's character just went to Japan. Story simularities are too easy to spot...white man joins non-white culture, gets in conflict with his own culture and stands up for the little guy. There's even a romantic interest with a member of the non-white culture! Seriously...I was joking when I said this looked like "Dances With Wolves," but after seeing this movie I realized just how right I was.<p>Well...um...as you can see, I had a "few" problems with the film. I'd have to say I would almost give it 2.5 stars, but like I said there is some guilty pleasure action in it, but I don't consider it the greatest film ever like many called it. I had fun watching it, but I found it to be INCREDIBLY overrated. To toy with a history and culture like this may have been good for a smaller, less-known nation - but Japan's history has a good place in the hearts of many, and she is a major nation on the international scene. Watch this film if you like Tom Cruise or you just want to see some action. Don't watch it expecting an American version of a Kurosawa film like people are trying to make it out to be, because you will be disappointed. Very, very disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>The Last Samurai proves to be a very entertaining movie although I thought it was bit too long for the story. Tom Cruise does a good job protraying a guilt-ridden American warrior who was reborn as samurai warrior. It probably helped that his co-star Ken Watanabe proves to be a superior actor and he probably pushed Cruise to the higher level of acting once they began to shared scenes together. On the whole, the movie will worked for most people watching it because it gives a very idealistic look at the Japanese samurai culture at its best.<p>However, most of it proves to be pure historical fantasy at its best. You should never considered that this was the way it was back in Japan of 1876. Outdated armor and thinking are not the way of the Samurai. Samurai, like all warrior types, adjust and adapt to changing warfare. Anyone who even know a thing about the warring period of 1540 to 1615 understand that samurai went from bow and arrow to firearms proficiently very quickly. Where the movie take a major misstep is that while the spirit and teaching of the samurai is tradition based, fighting modes are not.<p>But this is a Hollywood movie made for American taste and perception. This is how many Americans see the samurai warriors of the old and just the way the many foreigners see American history as one of wars between cowboys and Indians or black folks tipping their hats to the white folks, this movie catered to best of the sternotypes. There is nothing truly historical about this film. The movie was made in the same mode as Mel Gibson's Patriot and Braveheart, all entertainment but no history.<p>Now this movie have been compared with Dances with Wolves and there seem to be some justice to that comparsion. Both shows how a lone white man surrounded by an alien culture, "went native" so to speak and aligned himself with that culture. Both movies introduced these alien cultures through that white man's perception and his inevitable acceptance and entrance to that culture. In both cases, this was well done and it serves the viewers well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>"The Last Samurai" is a story about a Civil War veteran who goes over to Japan to fight the last pocket of Samurai; he is taken captive by the Samurai, but eventually learns to respect this dying culture and adapt to their way of life.<br /><br />WHAT WORKS: The movie is beautiful to look at; the cinemtography is magnificent. The story is generally engrossing and it's great to envision how the Samurai may have really lived in Japan hundreds of years ago. Speaking of which, the costumes and sets are outstanding, no doubt about it.<br /><br />WHAT DOESN'T WORK: I enjoyed the movie, I did, but the plot is obviously taken from "Dances With Wolves," a very superior film. One could also cite "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Last of the Dogmen" as films with similar plots. (Although "Dogmen" is basically a rip-off of "Dances With Wolves," the story takes place in the modern world, so it definitely possesses its own uniqueness). The scene in "Samurai" where the Samurai make their first dramatic appearance is obviously ripped-off straight from a similar scene in "Dogmen" wherein the Indians make their first appearance (compare the two scenes for verification).<br /><br />The score in the film is certainly serviceable but parts of it painfully sound like a watered-down variation of the fabulous score from "The Last of the Mohicans."<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Although "The Last Samurai" could be subtitled "Dances with the Last Dogmen of Arabia," it's still quite enjoyable. People who have not seen these other four movies that so-obviously influenced "Samurai" will likely rate "The Last Samurai" higher than I have. If you really like this film and haven't seen these other movies I've mentioned, I encourage you to pick 'em up ASAP -- especially "The Last of the Mohicans" and "Dances With Wolves," which are two of the best movies ever filmed, period.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>It's unfortunate that some people dont see the true beauty of this film, like me if you are a anime fan you should see it. The last samurai is great from beginning to end the fight scenes were great and the story and plot was so perfect it's almost unbelievable. Even though the story is fake the families involved and the events that make this story come to life are all historic facts.These men died in battle and even know they died they died to get their point across and to be heard when they needed to be heard the most. It was a fight that couldn't be won but to these men it was either fight  and die proud  or run and you would be forced to kill yourself and die a coward, they died and the rest of their family lived to fight another day.Tom cruse did a great job in this movie but the awards should go to Ken watanabe or Katsumoto and the other men/samurai who made this movie great. To end this some peolple need to be told that before watching this movie dont mistake it for a fraud because some people expect Tom cruse to be the last samurai and seeing that he is not of japanese descent that might bother some people and it's nothing like that because I judged this movie before seeing it and I was dead wrong and suprised at what saw and loved this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>Edward Zwick directs this 2003 film on a historical incident involving an American military advisor sent to Japan to modernize and train the ruling emperor's forces in 1876-1877. This is your typical Hollywood revised history where actual dramatic events are diluted with your conventional PC script and mandatory vapid love story.  Although the film has a decent cast with good direction and cinemtography, it's bogged down by a generic Hollywood screenplay and poor script.<br /><br />Retired Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is fed up with the US Army and the Indian Wars.  Approached by a fellow veteran and nemesis (Tony Goldwyn), Algren accepts a lucrative offer to train the Emperor of Japan's forces along the modern standards of 1875.  Arriving in Japan, Algren's informed that the Emperor's traditional samurai warriors and their leader (Ken Watanabe) oppose all attempts to modernize Japan.  Believing that firearms are cowardly weapons, the samurai hold true to their Bushido code and continue to fight with their traditional weapons.  Disillusioned with his shame of the Indian wars he fought back home and eager to redeem his honor, Algren becomes enamoured with the ethos of Samurai warriors and so decides to join them for a final stand.<br /><br />This was a good story that just never seemed to soar.  This is mostly due to a generic and predictable formulaic Hollywood script with cliche dialogue.  Does every drama have to conclude with an out-of-place happy romantic sub-plot to the likes of a 90210 episode?  Although a film about samurai warriors, the film only pays lip service to the teachings of the Bushido code with quick scenes of warriors committing hara-kiri and hardened Japanese men sitting stoically on their knees drinking sake. The dialogue is contrived and superficial: exploring only the surface of the Bushido code and Japanese culture.<br /><br />In conclusion, the film is decent but comes far short of the epic it could have been.  Here, a great story was hampered by the inclusion of conventional modern plots that are at odds with the historical drama covered by the film.  The acting was decent but not terribly memorable due to a rather contrived script.  For a true rendition of the samurai code and feudal Japan, I would recommend films by Akira Kurosawa instead such as 'Ran', 'Kagemusha', or 'The Seven Samurai.'</p></br><a href="../users/A3A48XEYWLWH7T.html">A3A48XEYWLWH7T</a><br/><p>Sunday, May 16, 2004 / 4 of 5 / Surprisingly good vehicle for Cruise.  Tom brings a suitably tortured mein to the role as a late 1870's army captain fresh off the Indian wars of the west.  Brought over to Japan to ostensibly modernize their army and remove the vestiges of the samurai caste he is quickly captured and spends the rest of the movie going through a `Dances with Wolves' transformation into a gaijin warrior.  Despite the simplistic plot, the movie is delivered with a great earnestness and sense of purpose.  Watanabe is at once fierce and serene as the lead samurai, [was he a daimyo or in the service of one?].  This film hints at the beauty and depth of bushido, trying to make it understandable to the western sensibility.  I have a great love for Japanese culture, history, and aesthetics; and this film managed to mix in some wonderful examples of those.  While it may be decried as a star vehicle for Cruise I think one can watch and enjoy it from period piece point of view.

It was a blockbuster smash in Japan.  It tells the story of the Samurai of Japan and how they became obsolete due to westernization of their country.  Although the last scene with the emperor concerning his decision whether to fully open Japan to the West is pure fiction, the rest is generally accurate.  The director seeks to romanticize the samurai.  The samurai traditions and culture are not that difficult to romanticize.  Everything they stood for is portrayed in the film.  Watching it, you yearn to add these values to your own life, and feel achingly their loss to today's society.  This is the true value of the film - to raise the samurai once again, in their full glory of life, and the strange glory of their deaths.<p>The climactic scene of the final battle between the samurai and the new army is predictable, yet still horrifying.  You just wish it could end differently.  Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are glorious.  Watanabe received a Best Supporting Actor nomination.  I feel The Last Samurai should have received more nominations, and at least one Oscar.<p>In real life, the last of the samurai did indeed perish in a last-stand battle against the new military.

Its hardhitting impact is intense enough to keep audiences' eyes wide open through the whole movie.  Its written plot of a US soldier changing his life for the better in Japan is brilliant.  Despite the war themes, there are some great heartwarming scenes, namely when the US soldier starts healing his pains from his US war battles.  As he begins learning Japanese traditions, he begins learning more about himself, which plays a crutial part in the film.  As this develops, the drama also develops, which keeps audiences interested.  This allows the conflicts between the two sides to be brought out as brilliantly as it was.  His friends' life stories add an additional unique flavor.  The war scenes are uniquely intense.  Few other movies have thought of such original war scenery.  This teaches audiences that there is no one way to fight a war or to solve a conflict. <p>Its Oscar-nominated 1870's Japanese setting is flawless.  They prove that they did their research to construct such an elaborate set.  The war scenes are desplicted as brutal as they should thanks to the special effects.  The costumes are accurate from those times.  Such great background offers an improved sense of this masterpiece film.<p>Tom Cruise's underrated role as US soldier Nathan Algren is his best in years.  His two years of training to prepare for his role paid off.  He never loses his intense sense of emotion for a second.  The pain and agony expressed are as pure as if he actually lived it.  Ken Watanabe's Oscar-nominated role as Samarai leader Katsumoto rightfully places him in the spotlight.  This performance makes acting appear easy when it's actually the opposite.  He proves that he will become a big-name actor in the next following years.  All other actors also performed their roles beautifully.<p>"The Last Samarai" is great for those looking for a unique war movie with emotion.  This is sure to please many audiences.

It is brilliant and poignant, with emotional and brilliant performances by Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe, and the rest of the cast. Tom Cruise is Captain Nathan Algren, a man who is conflicted by the past by a very serious incident that happened during the Civil War. He is offered a job in Japan, where he is going to train the emperor's soldiers. But, when they are pulled into combat early, that is when during the soldiers' first attack that Algren is captured by the Samurai and kept alive by Katsumoto, played by Ken Watanabe. That he is where he learns about his enemy and gets enlightened by them and decides to stay with them. Timothy Spall plays Simon Graham, a translator and photographer who is with Algren in this magnificent journey. Billy Connolly plays Zebulon Gant, a dear friend of Algren. Tony Goldwyn plays Colonel Bagley, a comrade and enemy of Algren's. This is a brilliant movie with a powerful story and a powerful word about how you look at things and you think at what they should be. Edward Zwick's directing is brilliant. The costume design by Ngila Dickson is splendid. The production design by Lilly Kilvert is incredibly beautiful. The film editing by Steven Rosenblum and Victor du Bois is excellent. The cinematography by John Toll is brilliant. The music by Hans Zimmer is powerful and brilliantly excellent.

Go see this movie and it might inspire you and make you think about things in perspective. See it before you see "The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King" in theaters everywhere.

The action scenes were awesome, but much more gory than even I expected. Those samurai swords can do some gruesome things. The movie is never boring, and it managed to keep my attention for the full 2 hours and 30 minutes.

Hey, I like samurai flims and I LOVE 'Seven Samurai', so knowing that a movie like this is coming out in theaters has really got me hyped up in anticipation.  Many people say that an epic film starring Tom Cruise is a lousy gimmick for the movie to bring in the big bucks, and to make Cruise and the WB look good.  When I was checking this out, thought the lousy idea is there, "The Last Samurai" actually executes into a well-productive and impressive film to see.<p>This film start off with the handsome actor as Nathan Algren, a wasted Civil War veteran grieving over his bloody memories of that war, being sent to the land of the rising sun by authorities of two nations in order to train Bigwig soldiers how to fight against the 'antagonists'.  During his first battle of Nihhon Civil War, he lost, and instead of being killed dishonerably by the oppositioners, they took him to their turf, a really nice and solitude turf.  Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), the head village chief and captain of his soldiers, decides to use him to know more on his enemies' new weapondrym and later builds a strong partnership with Algren, that which is Cruise, to stop them.<p>Since I realized this isn't based on a true story, I knew that this movie would go by-the-numbers and there would be some easy-to-recognize foreshadowing moments. Hey, this is an epic movie; Epic = violence, betrayal, love, and honor. Actually, the formula works in high numbers for this flick.  Knowing how Algren mourned over the massacre in a native-american village his men caused many years ago, and how he was adjust to a Japanese village while he was captured was intriguing, especially when he knows much about the Japanese culture: how the people were respectable though silly like normal people, be spiritually intertwine, understand nature, and aware about life and death, even children must know about it; man, now I can understand why death is acceptable in Japanese animation.  Adding Aldren knowing the hidden samurai spirit within, and the whole plotting structure makes this raw sushi well-done.<p>Great as it seems, on the less greener side, the movie doesn't  have a certain ingenuity that makes it inspiring and feels like it plays a big role in the movie industry and in our hearts.  The movie is very emotional and breathtaking, but it's not exactly thought-provoking.  Breathtaking is what I like to say the most on the movie's production value: good selection of cast, above-par acting, wonderful musical score, and battles mixed with somewhat-noticeable special effects that really build up an adreneline rush.<p>'The Seven Samurai', this movie is so not at its league, but "The Last Samurai" is a great epic film to watch.  It's not profound, but it's still compelling in many ways.  Samurai films like this should be made more, nowadays.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>I didn't have high expectations for this movie, but it surprised and pleased me enough to watch it 3 times.  I've always like Tom Cruise and he doesn't disappoint in this movie.  But the real star is Ken Watanabe as the Samurai leader-what perfect casting!

It's just the same movie except that instead of indians these are samurais!!<br /><br />Of course, this movie have MORE ACTION than Dances with Wolves, more warfare, more cool fights and more blood!!! I could say that Last Samurai is better than Dances but ONLY because of the action, the story is a little predictable but still interesting.<br /><br />P.S: If you have seen Dances with Wolves then you obviouslly note the differences between this one and Dances, but basically they are the same.<br /><br />Adios.</p></br><a href="../users/A146H6A41B26QT.html">A146H6A41B26QT</a><br/><p>Tom Cruise as a Samurai warrior?--my curiosity got the better of me! Be prepared to suspend all disbelief for<br /><br />2 1/2 hours for this film. Drunken, guilt-ridden, Indian War veteran is hired by Japanese government to stamp out  rebellion, gets captured, dries out, and over the course of a few months becomes a disciplined, fierce, Zen-like Samurai warrior. In his spare time he becomes fluent in Japanese. He switches sides, becomes a master tactician, kills countless Japanese soldiers and a few Americans along the way, and lives to tell the tale.<br /><br />The scenery was nice, the Japanese actors terrific, and thankfully the incipient love affair wasn't allowed to blossom on screen, which would have violated every norm of Japanese culture of the time. Maybe I'm taking it too seriously, but the notion that a Westerner could enter this proud, ancient culture with such relative ease seemed almost disrespectful to me. Several reviewers had trouble "getting" the idea of honor portrayed in the movie--that's just a measure of how totally impossible the plot is. No Westerner could ever do what Cruise does in this movie. Strictly for fun--don't expect anything remotely realistic.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F2JUHM6C9RZ9.html">A3F2JUHM6C9RZ9</a><br/><p>Tom Cruise stars in this wildly entertaining prequel to Nick Castle's THE LAST STARFIGHTER.  Miss this and you'll be searching for a sword to fall on.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PXHFGJZBNLXB.html">A2PXHFGJZBNLXB</a><br/><p>Until the ending (which a previous reviewer correctly described as &quot;maudlin&quot;), Edward Zwick's THE LAST SAMURAI is a magnificent samurai epic, filled with great big emotions but also blessed with more thoughtfulness and intimacy than the usual Hollywood epic. The insights into Japan during this particular time setting---the late 1800s, when the samurai way of life was slowly fading away and Westernization was taking over---are sure to fascinate, and the action scenes are first-rate, as is the widescreen cinematography here by John Toll. <p>Ken Watanabe got justly deserved plaudits for his authoritative supporting turn here as samurai leader Katsumoto---he really takes the screen by force. A lot of critics, for some reason, weren't so complementary to Tom Cruise, as the American Nathan Algren, here. Perhaps they thought his pretty-boy image got in the way of either the epic's grand ambition or the effectiveness of his own performance. Whatever the reason, I personally didn't have such problems with Cruise in this movie---he seemed convincing enough here, although he certainly is upstaged by the sheer authority of Watanabe's performance.<p>In short, THE LAST SAMURAI is overall a grand and glorious epic that admirably attempts to be more than just pretty pictures and awesome action scenes, and, more often than not, it succeeds in its noble ambitions. If the ending does come off as too preachy or over-sentimental in the usual Hollywood manner---well, I find it a forgivable lapse, indicative of the filmmakers' desire to function as both thoughtful historical commentary and great entertainment at the same time. I don't think many people will be bored by this movie (like many many people seem to be with LOST IN TRANSLATION). Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>They're Eastern costumes, mostly, but still costume drama. The situation, the final wresting of power from the last of the feudal lords, is historically true. The movie's story, however, involving the American gone native, is synthetic.<p>It's a good movie. It addresses the Japanese culture with knowledge and respect. It brings to life one of the defining moments of Japanese history, possibly the one moment that marks the start of modern era. The costuming and architecture are beautiful. It presents the bushido, the samurai ethic, as an all-consuming force in the lives of the samurai themselves but also in their families.<p>Still, I have reservations about semi-historical movies. Takamori's final battle is an historical event, and this presentation of it is fiction. Lord knows that Americans need more exposure to world history and that this flick is an enticing way to present it. Still, the movie blurs the line between fact and fiction, between entertainment and events as documented. As much as I like the movie, I don't think that it serves history very well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GA09FYFKL4EY.html">A3GA09FYFKL4EY</a><br/><p>Drunken, war-weary Cruise accepts a mission to train Japanese soldiers but finds the old way more suited to his personal sense of honor. Filled with thrilling battle scenes, fabulous cinematography, and the rich culture of ancient Japan, "Last Samurai" delivers on every level. Cruise's background and personal torment are glossed over a bit - this could have been explored more, and his romance with the widow of the warrior he defeats in battle is left unresolved, but this is a great adventure story. Highly recommend!</p></br><a href="../users/APIW11UEPKIC2.html">APIW11UEPKIC2</a><br/><p>So I expected this movie to show us what japanese life is like, and I was really excited.  I am a huge samurai film fan, I don't like the super crazy ones, but am more of a kurasowa guy.<br /><br />But the biggest problem with this movie is AT LEAST 75% of the movie running time, it is showing tom cruise and then it cuts away to the next scene and theres tom cruise, then they hsho you a different angle of the shot, oh that's cool, now I have a better angle of tom cruise.  It was sickening.  It's not like he failed in this role, but they certainly should have focused on smoething else.  Another big problem for me was the emporer.  I think they found the person they liked as far as looks go, but this kid has no acting ability whatsoever.  They should have put in like a jet li, and he would have been better even not being in an action role.  And sorry for using jet as an example, but I can't think of a japanese equivilent.<br /><br />So the ending was nothing spectacular, but better than most scenes because they actually show other people besides tom, and i just don't like movies when the only time they focus on the side characters is when they die.<br /><br />This seemed like a mix of a japanese movie, american, and a mainland china prodution.  It even had a hint of the UK in it, but doesn't excel in any of these countries filmmaking areas whatsoever.<br /><br />So with a tad more action and some a better final scene, and an overhaul done to the story to showcase at least one other person besides tommy boy.<br /><br />It does have a couple of good action scenes and the production value is very high, just don't expect to see a real samurai movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AOVJYIUATQKR5.html">AOVJYIUATQKR5</a><br/><p>The Last Samurai is a movie of great action that ends in sadness.  Almost everyone you care about gets killed.  <p>Samurai were feudal lords who occasionally battled the Emperors and those that controlled the emperor.  The fight scenes and the cinematography are at times awesome.  Cruise is very creditable in his role as a disillusioned X-army Captain who had been with the seventh cavalry, presumably with Reno's force after Custer divided his force into three groups, hence he survived.  Cruise goes to Japan to teach the Emperors army how to use modern western weapons, gets captured and ends up sympathetic to his captures cause.  Patty Hurst Syndrome?<p>It is a little bit like the Last of the Mohicans or the Thirteenth Warrior.  The viewer is left with a an empty feeling and of course the bad guys are the Americans.<p>Once one gets past the politics of the makers of the movie and the inaccurate historical presentation it's a pretty good movie for those old enough for an R rating.  This is not a sword fight movie to watch with ones 10 year old.  Heads fly, blood spurts and at times the story bogs down into the maudlin and smarmy.  <p>There is probably a 5 star movie inside this otherwise 3 star movie, if they'd let me edit it down to 90 or 100 minutes, removing the moderate use of cursing, the really boring moments that contribute little to the story line, blood spurting and the beheadings.  For a better sword action movie with sharp editing and a great screen play, check out Antonio Banderas in the Thirteenth Warrior.  13th is still not a movie for your 10 year old, but that is more because it creates a scariness and feeling of dread about what the Warriors are up against.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>But never really hooks the viewer.

Not just that, but they were exponents of everything we as a civilized society presumably stand for.<br /><br />The samurais of this period -- and in this movie--, though inarguably romantic and daring, were essentially trying to turn the clock back to a time when tribalism, internecine warfare, and general lawless bloodshed were the norm.  In short, these guys were standing squarely in the way of a modern humanistic society informed by values such as meritocracy, egalitarianism, due process, etc.<br /><br />And we're supposed to sympathize with these guys merely because Cruise's character happens upon them?<br /><br />This stuck in my craw so much, it pretty much shouted down every other excellence of the film, and there were a few.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY.html">A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY</a><br/><p>Every year a crop of prestige pictures get dumped out of the major studios in Hollywood.  Every one of these large scale epics is full of wild battles, romance, outstanding performances, and the cream of the crop celebrities.  These are the films that are especially created to win the coveted Academy Awards.  The problem is every year one film is so big, so bloated, and so prestigious it turns into a silly mess.  This year's film is EDWARD ZWICK'S THE LAST SAMURAI.  A fun action film that longs to be SCHINDLER'S LIST.<p>The Last Samurai stars Tom Cruise (Vanilla Sky) as Captain Algern, a soldier who stood with General Custer as he made his famous last stand.  While in battle he is forced to kill innocent Native American women and children, and it eats away at his soul.  Turning him to drink. <p>When his old associates give him a job training Japanese soldiers to fight against a Samurai warrior named Katsumoto (Ken Wantanabe, T.R.Y.).  Everything seems okay.  That is until he's captured by Katsumoto and begins to learn the law of the Samurai.<p>THE LAST SAMURAI at it's best boasts some of the most breathtaking close up battle scenes I've seen in a long time.  I could hardly believe that for once I could follow the battles, because for the first time in a long time the camera stayed pretty steady.  It simply wasn't sound effects and shaky steady cams moving around.  It was real, and true battle choreography.  Now that made me smile.<p>I also loved the scene in which Algern battles a group of overzealous Japanese soldiers who are attacking his friend.  The scene actually works and is a rare sight.  A modern fight scene that doesn't feature wire effects or CGI.  It reminded me of old Bruce Lee movies.  A scene that was about a fight and not about special effects creating it.<p>SAMURAI also features a nice relationship between Algern and Katsumoto.  Enemies that become friends, Wantanabe's character is strong because it feels real.  Unlike SONNY CHIBA's silly turn as the proverb spouting sword dealer in KILL BILL.  Wantanabe exudes the feeling of a real Samurai and not of a silly Kung Fu movie reject.  I loved how he could embody this man who is torn between his country and his king.  <p>SAMURAIS real flaw is that it thinks it's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, THE SEVEN SAMURAI, CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, and DANCES WITH WOLVES, when it's really just a fun battle movie.  It takes itself far too seriously.  You watch it with this feeling that at any moment you'll see a graphic pop on the screen that says "FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION."<p>It also gets the award for the silliest and most melodramatic thing screamed by an actor in peril in 2003.  Algern is going through alcohol withdrawal and screams "SAKI" at the top of his lungs.  I was sitting next to my brother-in-law, and every time the film hit another stupidly melodramatic moment I would whisper "Saki!!"  It kept me entertained.<p>I was also aghast that in front of me a small boy no more than five was sitting there.  There is a pretty gruesome scene in which a man loses his head.  Never have a felt so badly for a little child than I did when he screamed out in terror and then latched onto his mothers shoulder.  LISTEN PARENTS OF THE WORLD, THE RATING SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED SO THAT THIS KIND OF THING DOESN'T HAPPEN.  YOU WANT TO WATCH AN R-RATED MOVIE RENT IT AT YOUR LEISURE.  DON'T BRING A FIVE YEAR OLD TO THE MOVIES TO WATCH IT. (Calming Down) Thank you!<p>THE LAST SAMURAI is a mixed bag.  On one hand its breathtaking to watch and on the other its kinda of silly.  I'm going to recommend it to those whom like really cool battle sequences.  But for the rest of you why not give THE SEVEN SAMURAI or even BRAVHEART a chance.  They are far better films.<p>*** out of 5</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Set in 1870's Japan, "The Last Samurai" is most effective when it sticks to the harsh realities of its blood- soaked battle scenes and avoids the softening effects of its two-bit philosophizing.<p>Tom Cruise is stoic and stolid as Nathan Algren, a former captain of the United States army who is having trouble coming to grips with the part he played in slaughtering a village of innocent American Indians.  Now drifting aimlessly through life, Algren disinterestedly agrees to go to Japan to help train its military in the ways of modern warfare so that the nation's leaders can take on and destroy the sole remnants of the samurai forces who are still using swords as weapons.  Once he is captured by the "enemy," however, Algren falls under the spell of the Samurai Code of Honor and switches his allegiance in battle, ending up fighting with the samurai (whom he views as the equivalent of "Indian underdogs" in the struggle) against the people he was brought over to train.  The film, thus, becomes a study in redemption as this one man attempts to find his place in the scheme of things and to erase the life-crippling guilt of his past actions.<p>Director Edward Zwick, who made one of the best war films of modern times ("Glory"), has had less success here, mainly because he stacks the deck so shamelessly in favor of the samurai that we can't help feeing manipulated all throughout the film.  In many ways, "The Last Samurai" is as guilty of one-sidedness as those old time Westerns that used to portray the Indians as faceless savages and the White Man as noble adventurers and heroes.  Each perspective seems equally unhistorical and phony.  It's hard for us to see much meaning in Algren's redemption when the people he is following spend much of their time garroting themselves and chopping off one another's heads.  And all the talk about "honor," "shame," the beauty of cherry blossoms and getting in touch with the inner self through a zen-type lifestyle don't amount to too much when we stand back and realize that the samurai were basically bloody warriors who often terrorized the general populous with their acts of brutality and violence.  The makers of the film want us to see a vast moral chasm separating the samurai from both the Japanese military and the evil American colonials who support them, but it is, ultimately, a distinction without a difference.  So when we are asked to cheer on Algren and his compatriots in battle or weep over their fate, the movie loses its grip on us in a major way.  The film becomes just another case of glorifying and romanticizing a way of life that we somehow suspect was a bit less noble and honorable than we have always been led to believe by the countless movies on the subject.<p>Technically, "The Last Samurai" is a mighty impressive achievement.  In addition to the eye-catching vistas of rural Japan and a beautifully recreated 19th Century city, the film's large-scaled battle sequences have been stunningly mounted and executed - though the faint-of-heart should note that the body count on screen is enormous and the blood flows generously throughout.  There are, also, some admittedly touching moments scattered throughout the film, though the Hollywood corn is never too far from the surface (particularly in Algren's romantic attachment to the wife of a man he killed).<p>"The Last Samurai" is a joy to look at, but its unsubtle approach to its material and lack of evenhandedness make it far less meaningful and moving than, I'm sure, it both wanted and intended to be.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>In 1876, Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is living in a bottle.  He is a Captain in the U.S. Army who is so ashamed of the things he did in the Indian Wars under Gen. Custer that he has to constantly drink in order to forget the extremely painful memories.  Unable to keep a job, he decides to accept an offer from a Japanese noble-man.  Along with a few other military officers, including his old Colonel (Tony Goldwyn), whom Algren detests for ordering him to carry out viscious orders, and Algren's friend Zebulon Gant (Billy Connolly), he will travel to Japan to train the imperial army in modern warfare.  Japan is trying to modernize after centuries of isolationism, and there is a rebellion led by the Samurai, who believe that by modernizing, Japan is losing its sense of self.  The Samurai, led by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), will do everything they can to protect the traditional Japanese values.<br /><br />After the first battle, the poorly trained Imperial Army is massacred by the disciplined Samurai warriors, and Algren is the only soldier able to actually defend himself.  Sensing his strength, Katsumoto has him taken alive in order to be studied.  While in Katsumoto's village, Algren begins to discover many admirable qualities of the Samurai, including their discipline, their loyalty, and most importantly for Algren, their serenity.<br /><br />This was a great film; it dealt with loyalty, moral ambiguity, and courage.  The story, while somewhat predictable, was a good one to tell.  However, this story probably is not very accurate, but that can be overlooked.  There are some logic problems (Algren learned Japanese FAST), but once again, they don't detract from this great film.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFNOZKR9WTYI.html">AIFNOZKR9WTYI</a><br/><p>This is not really a bad movie. It is just that it is impossible to take seriously. The movie takes itself so seriously that the viewer is dispensed of the obligation. As for the subject matter, the thing comes off as a Gilbert and Sullivan opera gone wrong. A comic opera with no comedy. A set of characters move around in front of lavishly colored back-drops, say things to one another, asiatics murmur inscrutably and doll-like women tip-toe around like Fred Flintstone at a bowling alley. The only thing missing is the &quot;plinlinglinglingling&quot; sound of high piano keys to accompany their movements. What's that? You say I am being unfair? Again, I am not saying this is a bad film, it is just an humorless and a pointless one. It is not a dramatization of historical events, so... what could possibly be the point? It might as well depict some kind of Boxer Rebellion that takes place on the moon, wherin Buzz Aldrin, after being kidnapped by lunar monks, decides to throw in with them as they storm Apollo 11.

For hundreds of years the country was ruled by a prime minister who had the title of Shogun. His rule was backed by a feudal system of armed nobles who had retinues of hereditory warriors called samurai. Samurai were of noble birth and trained in both warrior skills and an ideology of warfare.<p>The 19th Century saw the Emperor of Japan sieze power from the Shogun and to end the feudal system creating a conscript army and a modern navy. To do this he imported overseas advisors, Prussians to train the army British and French to help with the navy. The change to the power structure lead to a revolt of the samurai class upset at the loss of their traditional privalages. This film is about this revolt.<p>Being an American film the action is seen through the prism of an American officer. This of course is the first point at which we move into the land of fairy tale. At the time of the events of this film America had a small army of no great reputation. However probably Tom Cruise does a poor German accent. <p>Rather than being a drama about what happened the film is about the Tom Cruise character. That is a person who has had his soul destroyed as he has been part of a massacre of Indian women and children. This has turned him into an alcoholic who is drifting through life. In this film he is redeemed. <p>He is captured by the samurai in a battle and then kept prisoner in a remote village for the winter. In his time he becomes a convert to the samurai life style and decides to switch sides in the last epic pointless battle to keep the feudal system going in Japan. In this way he redeams himself and heal the pain of the massacre. He is also able to kill the American officer who commanded him to kill the native Americans. <p>The film is gratutously insluting to important figures in Japanese history. The emperor Meiji who was responsible for modernising his country is portrayed instead as a figure of self confidence and vision, as a dithering boy who needs Tom Cruise to help him discover the true values of his country. Cruise in talking to his feudal buddies the Samurai immediately takes on a leadership role planning the last idiotic battle and gives them tiresome lectures about the wars between the Greeks and the Persians. <p>The film is not only laboured and tiresome it is reflective of American hubris and is unhistoric in putting them at the centre of events they had no part in.</p></br><a href="../users/AEVNUEDRGTC4P.html">AEVNUEDRGTC4P</a><br/><p>The Last Samurai is a re-do of the 1990 borefest Dances With Wolves.

Eventually, as reformers took hold in 19th Century Japan, a new national army based on the peasantry was formed.

Katsumoto (Watanabe) has a righteous anger, yet you need to listen carefully to his raging with the Emperor.....<p>Algren finds himself in a new world and a new mentality.  I was left to wonder if there is a metaphor regarding today's east verse west conflict.  Today, some of the west come to adopt eastern ideology and even side with those in conflict with their societies.  It seems more that Cruise is accepting a cause than anything else and releases himself from his torment.<p>The movie reflects a full range of emotion from sorrow, to anger to love and deep reflection.  This is rated R yet only for the violence and some language, there is no sex, no nudity and very little language and some of what is spoken is almost humorous.  Billy Connoly looks like John Cleese.  He has a few lines that come across funny to a degree.<p>Tony Goldwyn plays Cruise's alter-ego who stays in character throughout.  <p>The battle scenes, from the two larger battles to the one small skirmish are pictured very intensely.  I wonder if the scenes showing the battle between the Samurai and the newly formed Japanese army are really a reflection of the American Indian fighting the US Army in the great Indian wars.  It is from the same timeframe and to me it seems possible that the message was easier to get across so that it would be acceptable for those who are resistant to politically correct messages.<p>The basic story though is well thought out and well presented.  I would have rated it a 5 and many would do so as well, yet the "BraveHeart" type violence to me is getting a little worn thin.  The sheer violence of the small battle that ensued in Tokyo was enough to show intensity and bravado. The scene of hand to hand combat was appropriate and realistic.  I particularly was impressed with the intense desire to live shown in that scene.<p>The sensation of emotion is very intense in this film and sensationalism was not necessary for me.<p>I will watch this movie again and will add it to my wish list.</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>The story focuses on a Civil War veteran named Capt. Nathan Algren ( Tom Cruise). He reluctantly agrees to train and lead an army of Japanese soldiers to defeat rebellion of the country's remaining Samurai. Unfortunately, Algren is captured in battle by the Samurai, and is held prisoner by them. The leader of the Samurai, Katsumoto ( Ken Watanabe), is interested in the American culture and wants to keep Algren alive to learn from him. As time passes, Algren comes to develop a friendship with Katsumoto. He also comes to embrace the Samurai way of life as well, and trains to become one of them, so that he can fight along side of the Samurai against the Japanese forces that oppose them.<p>With the acception of "Mystic River", "The Last Samurai" was my favorite film of 2003. For 2 1/2 hours, I was literally glued to the screen, and loving every minute of it. It has been quite some time since I have been that captivated by a film. The only downfall this film may have, is the fact that the story is almost a complete rip off of "Dances with Wolves". However, that does not make the film any less enjoyable. In fact, "The Last Samurai" is almost better. The story comes across as being much more dramatic and action packed when dealing with the Samurai. They have a deeper sense of honor, and their fighting style is much more deadly. Director Edward Zick did an amazing job of capturing every aspect of the Samurai culture, from the costume designs and simple way of life, to the weaponry and fighting style. The final battle between the Samurai and the Japanese soldiers is the best I have seen since "Braveheart". The Samurai are completely outnumbered, and still manage to put up one heck of a fight. Tom Cruise gave one of the best, if not the best performance of his career. However, the best performance of the film goes to Ken Watanabe. He was flat out amazing as Katsumoto and nailed every aspect of the Samurai warrior. The film's soundtrack and scenery are extremely beautiful as well.<p>Overall, "The Last Samurai" is an amazing film. Every aspect of the Samurai way of life is captured accurately, the performances given by the actors involved were amazing, and the final battle was incredible. Also, please check out the extras listed by Amazon for this 2 Disc DVD set. From the look of things, the extras are reason enough to purchase this film. There are deleted scenes, featurettes on the making of the film, a featurette comparing real life Samurai, and more. This is definately a bonus for myself and anyone else who appreciates the film, and the Samurai in general.<p>A solid 5 stars...</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>A disillusioned, alcoholic American soldier (Tom Cruise) hires out as a mercenary in Japan to put down the rebellion of a samurai leader (Ken Watanabe), but instead he comes to admire their ways and joins them in their struggle.  This is a deeply flawed film that nevertheless has many fine points to recommend it.  It is a rousing adventure with stirring battle scenes.  The photography, costuming, and production design are astonishing, presenting a convincing and fascinating portrait of samurai culture and Japanese peasant life.  The cast is mostly excellent, especially Watanabe, who should be remembered at Oscar time.<br /><br />However, there are two things that work against this film.  The first is Tom Cruise himself.  Although he does good work here, he just seems to be too lightweight as an actor to grapple convincingly with the issues of guilt and redemption that torment his character.  The biggest problem is the film's ending, which eschews an honest resolution in favor of Hollywood convention.  Nevertheless, the things that work in this film really work well, resulting in a entertaining and worthy feature./</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>A stunning story and modern classic!

So many of today's so-called "thrillers" are just dull.  With "Red Eye," Wes Craven manages to create a bit of suspension by skillfully building up our primary characters in Lisa(the lovely Rachel McAdams) and Jackson(the sinisterly perfect Cillian Murphy).  When we are first introduced to Lisa, we learn that she's the one solid rock in a world full of chaos.  She helps a co-worker, talks with the taxi driver, and has a phone conversation with her father all at once.  She appears to be very control of not just her life, but the world around her as well.  Jackson's the typical gentleman, almost too nice.  He handles a situation that could have gotten nasty in a very nice and toned down way.  He is precise and calculating.  With these aspects of our primary characters fleshed out, we get on the red eye flight to Miami with them.<br /><br />Calculating as ever, Murphy's character makes sure that he and McAdams end up seated together.  As the plane takes flight, Murphy makes a proposition to McAdams.  It's a proposition that can quickly tear her world apart.  Does she give in to Jackson, or does she try to outwit him?  I can't say much more without giving away the conclusion of the film.<br /><br />Just know that this is an above-average thriller.  It won't make you fear flying anymore than you already do, but it will hold your attention for its brisk running time.  It's worth a look, and perhaps a purchase.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Red Eye starring Rachel McAdams is a great thrill ride. The film takes place on a plane, hence the title and she meets a seemingly nice man played by Cillian Murphy. Lisa (McAdams) is terrified of fying but that fear suddenly evaporates when her fellow passenger threatens to kill her father, don't want to give too much away but Red Eye which is directed by Wes Craven will have you creeped out right 'til the very end. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>I'm a big fan of thrillers.  I especially love good thrillers and this is a good thriller.  Wes Craven, the director of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GETUDI">A Nightmare on Elm Street (Infinifilm Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000068IEU">The Last House on the Left</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AOX0E">The Serpent And The Rainbow</a>, brings another exhilirating tale to the screen.<br /><br />Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) is kidnapped on a plane by a man (Cillian Murphy) who wants something from her father.<br /><br />This movie is one I do recommend.  The DVD includes an audio commentary with Wes Craven, outtakes and bloopers, and few featurettes.  THis is a true thriller and one that's actually good.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I initially bought this because I thought Rachel McAdams was brilliant in Mean Girls and The Notebook, and I read on IMDB, that she's got the lead role in The Time Traveller's Wife (a book which I'm currently re-reading) opposite Eric Bana. Love the book, love her. Saw this for dead cheap, and although it sounds like a standard thriller movie, I thought I'll have that.<br /><br />The thing about Rachel McAdams is she never plays the same character twice, unlike so many of her peers. Plus, her look changes with every film, and I barely recognised her, with the reddish brown hair.<br /><br />Starring opposite Cillian Murphy, a truly creepy guy (I think it's the eyes), the two stars bounce well off each other, when they're the ones really holding the film up, as it's mostly about them. Rachel is playing a hotel manager, who is travelling back from a funeral. She's smart, she's tough, and she takes no nonsense. Cillian plays the appropriately named Jackson Rippner, a nice guy with a dark side. He befriends Rachel's character, buys a drink, and then reveals his Ace on the plane - he wants an important VIP, currently staying at her hotel, moved rooms, so he can be killed. And he also knows her father. And there's someone waiting outside his house, to kill him, if Jackson doesn't phone them at such and such a time.<br /><br />The third act is where it really lets the film down, when Wes Craven turns it into a Scream-chase-the-pretty-girl-around-the-house standard movie. It falls flat on its face here, but not so bad to ruin the rest of the movie.<br /><br />It's a truly claustrophobic movie, which is probably why I love these kind of movies. Makes me never want to set foot on a plane ever again. I'm glad I never travel alone either, because I can barely handle being in a pub (I always swap a ring onto my engagement finger), it's the whole thing that I can't handle being approached by someone in that kind of situation. The way Jackson approaches Rachel's character is just way too creepy for my liking. It's definitely worthwhile seeing. Plus the guys won't grumble too much at Rachel McAdams. I can't wait to see her in The Time Traveller's Wife.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"Red Eye" is a movie that puts most of its cards on the table. At the start we see a wallet with a pair of initials on it being stolen. We also see a large metal container being smuggled into the United States. Two points determine the pathof a line and we know that these two events are connected. Actually if you assume that everything you see and hear in this 2005 thriller has something to do with what is going on. If Carl Ellsworth (who wrote the "Halloween" episode of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer") has somebody on the airplane suddenly talk about a missing pen, then that would be a CLUE, and attention must be paid. That does not mean that director Wes Craven ("Scream/2/3") will not play with your expectations in an effort to keep things honest, but for the most part you can see how everything is set up and red herrings are pretty nonexistent. The result is more a question of anticipation than predictability and it was not until the big finish that I actually got to the point where I was saying (out loud in fact) that this could not be the "end" because "X" had not happened yet, which is pretty good for a thriller.<br /><br />The genesis for this film was apparently the simple idea of what happens if you get on an airplane and end up being seated next to the passenger from Hell. At this point many of you will be thinking back to "Planes, Trains & Automobiles," but this film is something quite different because it takes place in a world where apparently nothing is coincidence. Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams, who suddenly appears to be in every other movie being made) is a hotel desk manager for a swank hotel in Miami, who is heading home from Dallas after attending her grandmother's funeral. Her flight is delayed and she has occasion to meet Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy) more than once before she gets on the flight and discovers they are seatmates. He wants to know if she is stalking him and what proves to be a deadly game begins in earnest.<br /><br />I have to admit that when I watched this DVD I had managed to forget anything I might have heard or read about "Red Eye." Obviously Lisa is the heroine and Jackson is the villain (after this and "Batman Begins," Murphy is going to have to make an earnest effort to avoid being typecast in such roles). But since all the dots connect in this film it has to have something to do with Charles Keefe (Jack Scalia), the new head of Homeland Security who said some rather stupid things on television for someone whose position has to do with defense and not offense when it comes to terrorists. Before she gets on the plane Lisa is juggling cell phone calls from her father (Brian Cox) and her nervous assistant, Cynthia (Jayma Mays), and the film puts more of its cards in position on the table. But there is a hole card, which is revealed when Lisa has to change her blouse (talk about bait and switch).<br /><br />The best thing this film has going for it is Rachel McAdams. In case you did not notice, 2005 was a very good year for the actress. After being the blonde Queen Bee in "Mean Girls" back in 2004, she went back to dark hair and did "The Notebook." Then in 2005 she made "Red Eye" in between "Wedding Crashers" and "The Family Stone." She may well be the best thing in all three of those films, but this is the one where she has to do the most heavy lifting. Her character is smart, which only makes her more attractive as far as I am concerned, and despite her vulnerability we do not believe that she will be a victim. There are some moments where both the heroine and the villain are conveniently stupid (when you get somebody down, go all in and finish them off: everybody in my family knows this), but there are enough smart moments and we are rooting for Lisa, so such slights can be easily forgiven.</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>I finally managed to get my hands on the DVD and enjoyed curling up to it on what proved to be a snowy winter wonderland outside my window.<br /><br />Wes Craven is perhaps known for cheesy teenage type movies, and while this is definitely in his character it was pretty entertaining and it was enough for me and my boyfriend, who liked it even more than me, to sit back and watch it and then to agree that we both liked it.<br /><br />Rachel McAdams was genuine, fresh and pretty: she conveyed many emotions with her face and tear streaked eyes, as Cyclops like with his polarizing blue eyes Cillian Murphy went from a friendly fellow passenger to a heartless man who held her and her fathers future in his palm. He knew how she liked her eggs cooked at 3 am, who broke her heart, what her father watched on TV and where she lived, as he knew exactly how to control this one person in order to carry out a grander evil plan.<br /><br />Since there are only so many things that she could do on the plane, it's up to her wit and personal strength to try and save the day. She doesn't give up, while we did watch her fail in many attempts, and how Murphy made her pay for it, it was a great movie. Renting it before a purchase is probably a good idea, because as wasn't predictable, it did seem to go in the favor of McAdams in the few scenes when she conquers some unusual obstacles.<br /><br />Overall a fun movie, interesting looking actors, some espionage moves and plenty of chases.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>I thought that this movie had one of the best trailers of all time; it gave the impression of being a romantic film before revealing that you'd been deceived.  The trouble is, you are still deceived.  It gives the promise of being a horror film (especially with Craven directing) but it is really a thriller.  It is not a bad thriller, but it is not an especially great thriller either.<br /><br />The premise: Beautiful Woman seated next to Attractive Guy on Airplane.  Instead of turning out to be her next boyfriend, he turns out to be a terrorist-for-hire, who is forcing her to make a phone call that will help kill a diplomat and his family.  If not, they will murder her father.  Most of the movie is occupied with the plane flight and the battle of wills between them.  Of course, in a concept movie like this, there has to be all sorts of distractions and unlikely happenings in order to give the movie momentum.  In the end, logic breaks down and it devolves into the standard "knife-weilding-bad-guy-chasing-the-heroin" picture.  Subtlety has never been one of Wes Craven's strong points.<br /><br />Still the picture LOOKS great.  There are great performances from the leads.  I would have felt cheated in theaters, but it makes an OK rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>On the whole, this is the type of movie that falls somewhere between being mediocre and really bad.  It has a few moments (an unmistakable product of the now common "the trailer was better than the film itself" phenomenon that Hollywood execs skillfully employ to keep raking in the bucks), but it is worth a full watch just for the performance of Cillian Murphy, who may be our next Christopher Walken if he makes the right career decisions.  So far his talent has been wasted on self-addressed directorial loveletters like Sandra Bullock's "Murder By Numbers" and  pointless spots in crapfests like "The Village", but it seems he is smartening up: his performance as Scarecrow in "Batman Begins" left no doubt as to his psychopathic potential.<br /><br />He almost saves this bungled psychodrama which degenerates into an unredeemable mess after his character Jackson Rippner (gee, wonder who that's a reference to Wes) boards the plane with the stomach churningly "heroic" Rachel McAdams.  Her character was so sweet, so together, so plain wonderful that I wanted to throw up.  But even his shark-eyed charisma can't bear the weight of the script and Craven's insistence on always being goofy.  I wonder if he's aware of this or not: he has become such a joke that maybe he knows no one will ever take him seriously again, hence the self-degradation-via-failed-camp in movie after movie.<br /><br />That said, Murphy running around like the velvet menace with the hole in his throat and an unstoppable fury makes it worth enduring.  This is an odd Irishman with a lot of potential for being an actor we won't forget, if he sticks with films like "Begins" and "28 Days Later".  Rent it and get a look at this blossoming, scary new talent.</p></br><a href="../users/ASIA7V7CBSKD3.html">ASIA7V7CBSKD3</a><br/><p>I'm not a big fan of scary movies, mainly because of all the bad decision making and unreal characters (bad guy gets shot 9 times and is still running around full strength).  However, this movie is very well scripted and carries its suspenseful pace in a manner that is rare amongst it genre.  Being a Hotel Manager myself I really appreciate the "Comment Card" scene at the end with McAdams and the angry Gst.  This movie has great action sequences, has a plausible storyline, and "bad decisions" are kept to a minimum.  I highly recommend this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) is a stressed out girl. She's just been to her grandmother's funeral in Texas and now she's returning home to Miami, back to her job as a luxury hotel manager. While she talks her flustered assistant manager (Jayma Mays) through a minor crisis on her cell phone, she also finds time to talk with her father (Brian Cox), whom she loves dearly and constantly worries about; she can't wait to reconnect with him once she's home.<br /><br />Lisa's a solitary kind of girl, coolly professional, impeccably focused, and fiercely resolute. She's constantly living by the mantra that the customer is always right. Meanwhile, at the airport, it's dark and stormy, so the red eye flight has been delayed. Whilst Lisa waits in line at the check-in counter, she strikes up a conversation with a charming fellow passenger, Jackson (Cillian Murphy). They meet later for drinks in the airport bar and again on the plane when they discover they are seated in the same row.<br /><br />Yet there is something in the steely stare of his pale blue eyes and his overly calm manner that unnerves Lisa, although she just can't quite put her finger on it. Her hesitations are proved accurate, because it doesn't take long, right after the bumpy takeoff, for Jackson to drop his affable nice-guy pose and reveal his true colours.  In reality, Jackson is part of a terrorist cell that is planning assassinate the deputy secretary of homeland security, who will check into Lisa's hotel the next morning.<br /><br />Lisa must do exactly as Jackson instructs or a killer standing by at the Miami home of her father will murder her dad. Jackson calmly demonstrates to Lisa that summoning help from any of the airline staff or passengers will not be helpful, and will unequivocally endanger her father.  For now, she is trapped in her seat, an unwilling accomplice of this strangely Machiavellian man, who has so wickedly deceived her.<br /><br />There's no doubt that Red Eye reeks of B-grade sensibilities, more suitable to late night cable television, something perhaps on Lifetime, a sort of TV movie, rather than a fully-fledged feature film. Viewers will also have to suspend disbelief as the various machinations of the plot are played out.<br /><br />The logic of the film seems just to stretched and out of place, but luckily director Wes Craven keeps the proceedings appropriately fast-moving thanks to his expert sense of pacing and attention to detail. Red Eye gets the feeling of plane travel right, from the quiet that often descends upon takeoff to the harried flight attendants who fight to keep smiling even when annoyed, and the scenes in the aircraft have a real feeling of Hitchcockian claustrophobia.<br /><br />The acting is generally good, the standout being the lovely Rachel McAdams who makes a terrific heroine for this story, and imbues her character with just the right mix of the vulnerable and the gusty. Lisa possesses a mysterious past that Jackson manages to exploit, but she also has a fierce determination to foil Jackson's plot. Murphy is pure malevolence, using his unusual face and physical presence to suggest all sorts of nasty surprises.<br /><br />Red Eye perhaps lacks the polish and star wattage of the Jodie Foster film Flightplan, which also used airline interiors to create suspense, but this film has a slick energy and it definitely does a much better job at keeping up the suspense throughout. Red Eye is strictly B-grade fare, but it has a mischievous intelligence and enough genuine tension to make it well worth a look.

What makes it really worthy are the excelent performances by Murphy (very creepy !) and the wonderful, Rachel MacAdams. Only minor complaint is (spoiler ahead), why did the latter try so hard to evade the police when the plane lands instead of simply surrendering ?<br /><br />The movie came out at the same time than Fligth plan which caused some confusion on the people sitting beside me a the theater (when is Jodie Foster going to appear ?)</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>A thriller of a rare intensity. Three lines of crime are connected together by one woman taken hostage by a high class hitman on her plane to Florida. Her father is one stake. She is the second. But most important of all an important person, probably in politics, is menaced with his whole family, if that woman cooperates to save her father's life. The killer will fail, the killing(s) will not happen, no one will get hurt except a couple of crooks, but Wes Craven builds such a suspense that you can hardly believe you are taken along such a demented adventure, that can happen - alas - everyday to nearly everyone.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit&eacute; Paris Dauphine, Universit&eacute; Paris I Panth&eacute;on Sorbonne</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>RED EYE is good, clean, solid, suspenseful fun.  It's a low-budget film that doesn't look it because it doesn't spend money on stuff it can't pull off.  Wes Craven has put together a solid-cast of up and coming young stars, and given them a chance to shine in a genre film that is far above the average for its ilk.<br /><br />Rachel McAdams (whose bandwagon I am not quite firmly on, after THE WEDDING CRASHERS and this film) and Cillian Murphy (great in 28 DAYS LATER and quite effective in BATMAN BEGINS) meet at the airport.  He is silkily charming with her, and she, while not "looking for love" is happy to spend a moment or two with him.  Then, when they discover they are seatmates, she is surprised at the coincidence, but happy enough to know her seatmate isn't some crazy old lady or overweight businessman.<br /><br />Nope, he's just a contract killer with a dash of psycho-killer thrown in.  Turns out he needs her to make a few calls to the hotel she manages to make sure that the visiting Secretary of Homeland Security is moved to a room that will make him vulnerable to assassination.  If she doesn't comply, her will order her beloved father murdered.  Oh, and of course, the clock is ticking and time is FAST running out.<br /><br />Upon reflection, it's a pretty silly scenario.  This is the BEST plan these A-1 killers could come up with??!!  But McAdams and Murphy are far too watchable to think about those things while watching the film.  That's what you want from a suspense film...to be able to suspend all disbelief and actually go along with the thrilling proceedings for 90 minutes or so.<br /><br />McAdams tries several tactics to thwart her tormentor.  Some might say she is a "spunky" character, but she has a bit more grit than that.  McAdams makes her very appealing and we root for her immediately...which is important...the film doesn't have time to slowly make us warm to her.  McAdams has a winning smile, intelligent eyes and isn't so outrageously attractive that we hold her at arms length.  Murphy has the important knack of making his eyes go empty of all emotion, which makes him instantly unlikeable.<br /><br />Brian Cox, one of the finest character actors around, plays the father and he's good in his little part as well.<br /><br />It doesn't sound like much of a film, does it?  But within its 80+ minutes, you get more heart-quickening moments that your average 2 hour thriller.  It's a small movie that makes the absolute most of its limited resources.  Wes Craven obviously hasn't lost all his skills as a filmmaker.  And he was SO lucky in that his two leads are fast emerging as popular favorites.<br /><br />Also, since it's PG-13, it's not bad for kids.  A few mild swear words are thrown out, but mostly the rating comes from the intensity of the sparring between these two.  I liked it a fair amount...it won't be remembered as an all-time great, but it's really one of this year's more pleasant surprises.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>What the hell has happened to Wes Craven? The man who went straight for the raw nerve with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JV5BIA">The Last House on the Left (Unrated Collectors Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0P6">The Hills Have Eyes</a> has seriously gone downhill in the rotten, PC-driven, PG-13 driven Hollywood of today. Studios are afraid to make R-rated movies these days. Not that Red Eye really needs it. But an injection of breathtaking suspense would have really helped this movie along and help us forget the silliness of the plot. As if <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JT69NM">Cursed [Blu-ray</a>] wasn't bad enough he continues a downward spiral with this very childish quickie with about as much intelligence as a old episode of Baywatch.<br /><br />The plot is thin excuse for the preposterous events in the film to happen and the political sub-plot is so vague and transparent it almost isn't even there. See if you can swallow this. Some hit-man (Cillian Murphy), part of a larger group, wants to convince a hotel manager (Rachel McAdams) to have a VIP move to another suite so he can fire a rocket at him from the ocean that the suite faces. He does this by cornering her on a late night flight (the 'Red Eye') with the threat of one of his henchmen parked outside her unaware dad's (the brilliant Brian Cox) house waiting to kill him if she does not comply. It's very pointlessly contrived. Why do they not just aim at the VIP from a different position and take him out from his original room rather than stalking and planning to scare a hotel manager for 8 weeks?<br /><br />Sixty minutes of this eighty-five minute film are spent on so-called 'mind games' with McAdams and Murphy trying to outwit each other on the plane. It's not thrilling and Craven fails to add any sense of hard edge or unbearable tension to it. McAdams and Murphy give half-hearted performances, totally aware that they are starring in a generic, mundane film. Brian Cox is completely and utterly wasted in a thankless role that requires him to do no more than sit around in a living room speaking single-word lines of dialogue. I can only assume he had a credit card bill to pay off that starring in this bore would settle.<br /><br />The subtext of the oppressed McAdams fighting back against Male tormentors is obvious and actually quite labored. How many more movies must we sit through where females face great (male-driven) opposition and pull through by relying on sheer women-only courage. In the last twenty-minutes McAdams does nothing but beat-down and mutilate Murphy. Fair enough he head-butted her and choked her a bit, but this part is played down and forgotten quickly while Craven makes a point out of Murphy's pain and suffering. I understand that women are easy to feel sorry for in movies (a bit sexist and narrow-minded if you ask me, but hey...I hate PC) but I would like to see a film where a man fights back at a woman who has made HIS life hell. It does happen in real life you know. But men are worthless, violent, evil pigs according to films like this getting real tired of it.<br /><br />Red Eye pretty much fails at everything it sets out to do simply by having a weak script and tepid direction. The teeny-bopper crowd, that this film was undeniably made for, may get a kick out of it but us older and wiser viewers who have been around long enough to appreciate Craven's stronger work will be seriously disappointed. It's worth absolutely none of your attention or hard-earned cash, but at least it's better than Cursed.</p></br><a href="../users/AM2PV53UX1JEQ.html">AM2PV53UX1JEQ</a><br/><p>This simple, effective, tight little thriller is the most purely engaging and entertaining movie I've seen all summer.

I'm sorry, but it had to be said.<br /><br />Moving on.....<br /><br />Director Wes Craven has taken a rather pedestrian script with stock supporting characters and little originality and elevated it to a reasonably tense thriller.  Well, it was reasonably tense for a little while, at least.  The scenes on the plane work rather well.<br /><br />Beyond that, however, it is largely formulaic and forgettable.<br /><br />Actress Suzie Plakson is in this film as a flight attendant.  Plakson is a wonderfully talented comic actress and theatre veteran.  She deserves better material than this.<br /><br />The two leads in the film play well off each other, but once the film changes into a series of chases and cat-and-mouse sequences in the third act it feels like something we've seen a hundred times before.<br /><br />**MILD SPOILER -- but relax, it's not too much**<br /><br />As Cillian Murphy's character exits plane to chase after McAdams' character at the Miami airport, he grabs a scarf off a female passenger to wrap around his throat wound.  He wears it like that for the rest of the film.  But when he ends up chasing/stalking McAdams' in her father's house, he looks in several shots like Paul Lynde in a neckerchief.<br /><br />Ooh, now that's scary.<br /><br />One of the few moments in the film that seemed original to me was a brief bit of business on a fishing boat.  How does one hide weaponry on a boat from a Coast Guard inspection?  Find out in this film.<br /><br />And the Security team that ordered the search referred to the inspection team as the Coast Guard, but their vests read "Shore Patrol".  Limited costume budget, perhaps?<br /><br />And having that neckerchief cover up the throat wound all the time sure saved time and money on special effects make-up too.  Not decisively proof of a budget decision, but it was the first thing I thougt of.<br /><br />Worth seeing?  Maybe once.<br /><br />Worth buying on DVD eventually?  Hard to say.  The film runs less than 90 minutes so it at least is spared of any fat.  The "fat" is what tends to drag down suspense movies on repeat viewings, so "Red Eye" has the advantage of avoiding that problem.<br /><br />The premise for this film was interesting but not inspired.  In the hands of a lesser director it would probably have been completely forgettable altogether.  At least Craven instills it with a degree of filmmaking cred.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F7CCPK4QL359.html">A2F7CCPK4QL359</a><br/><p>Ever been on a plane flight with a seat mate you wish would exit the plane while in midair?<br /><br />Red Eye is a thriller in the classic sense. Most  of lt takes place on a closed plane area...Think Lifeboat in a plane! It is psychological melodrama with a twist of political thriller. Under the  skilled direction of Wes Craven, this thriller ride takes flight. Craven  seem to take a page or two from the playbook from the Master of Thrillers, Alfred Hitchcock with a twist or two of  his own added in.<br /><br />Cillian Murphy (Scarecrow from Batman  Begins) is extra  creepy here as he sits next to Lisa (played by Wedding Crasher's Rachel McAdams). Murphy threats Lisa in his soft cooing voice with her father's death if she doesn't move a poltico pemarked for death  into a  special hotel suite. He does his threats  in such a way that anyone would be scared of him.The film is scary and supensiful due to Murphy's quiet anger. The political thriller angle  seem slightly taken  from the film "Nick of Time" with  Johnny Depp<br /><br />Craven is a master of fear and he shows it here. His audio commentary on the dvd is amazing disection of movies and thrillers in general. It is a mini film course in less than 9o minutes<br /><br />DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM WHEN YOU FLY!<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Accomplishing a successful thriller is not an easy thing to do. You've got to have a good script, great acting, a threatening atmosphere, and adequate directing. Pulling off a good psychological thriller is even tougher, most of the aforementioned items needing to be ratcheted up a few notches. The standard by which I use to gauge these types of films is (no surprise) THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Perfect in every way, this film is a top-shelf example of the genre.<br /><br />Director Wes Craven is better known for his slasher-thrillers (NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, SCREAM, etc.), but here he's taking a shot at something a bit less bloody. And while RED EYE succeeds on a few levels, it fails miserably in several others.<br /><br />The story: Lisa (Rachel McAdams, THE FAMILY STONE) is flying from L.A. to Miami and is about to meet up with a psychopath, Jackson (Cillian Murphy, BATMAN BEGINS). Their first meeting is in the airport prior to boarding and it appears as if a romance is blooming between the two. But once aboard the Red Eye flight, Jackson quickly reveals his true scheme for getting so close to Lisa. Lisa is the manager of a high-profile Hotel in Miami and many politically active people stay there. One of these people must die, according to Jackson and whomever he represents. Jackson also has an ace up his sleeve: he's got a man with a gun sitting outside Lisa's father's house and if this politician doesn't die, Lisa's father will. So Jackson orders Lisa to move this political figure to another room, one with a more exposed balcony. Lisa calls the hotel (while they're in the air) and orders the room switch. But what will become of the politicians family? And Lisa's father?<br /><br />The good. Compartmentalizing the story in an airplane was genius. This forced close-up shots of the actors in this constrained environment and leant an explosive atmosphere to the movie. You could feel Rachel McAdams' character wanting to burst free of the plane. Cillian Murphy is just flat-out creepy. He can play the bad guy extremely well and I hated his character (that's a good thing).<br /><br />The bad. Once they leave the plane, the story gets a bit silly. We lose the compartmentalization feel and get into the standard chase scenes which were pretty weak. There are also side stories which we briefly glance but are never given insights to. The one that leaps out at me is the little girl flying alone for the first time. What was her purpose in the movie? I also thought the older lady that Lisa gives her book to was a bit forced. To ramp up the excitement, I would've liked to have seen Jackson kill the old gal on the plane then try to hide it. And, again, after we leave the plane, the story devolves into a standard storyline that is completely predictable. Does Lisa's dad survive? Does Lisa? Do the politician and his family get away without being assassinated? Will Jackson get away with his plan? If you know predictable films, you know the answers to all of these without ever watching RED EYE.<br /><br />Finally, let me say that Mr. Craven needs to stick to his chosen genre and not try and branch out like this unless he's willing to go all the way. And by all the way, I mean give us a story that we don't already know the ending to.</p></br><a href="../users/A10HMPPHWI3V0A.html">A10HMPPHWI3V0A</a><br/><p>Over the years I have been more than a little bit dissapointed with Wes Craven Directoral works, it's not that I thought that he had lost his edge or ability but more that he was just in some what of a slump, though the movie was not flawless or spectacular like "A Nightmare On Elm Street", "The People Under the Stairs" or the "Scream' trilogy, it was simply a good prototype of an exciting thriller. Obviously Mr. Craven changes his movie making style to a more suspenful thriller type and somewhat leaves behind his slasher roots, I think one of the reasons that I was so pleased after seeing this movie was because I thought that it might be bad just like every other movie he has made since ... well ... "Scream", I mean come one have any of you people seen "They" or "Cursed" ..... BARF!<br /><br />One of "Red Eyes" strengths was it's cast, Rachel McCadams was very good in playing the lead role while Cillian Murphy nails his first shot at being a Villian, (I mean he is interesting enough trust me when I say that he is a very believable in this role), not only the to lead charactors but as a whole everyone did their part to make this movie successful.<br /><br />Something that did bother me SOMEWHAT was that the movie seemed way too short ... I thought that if the movie would have been a little bit longer, the middle of the film and the climatic ending could have been even more suspencful, thrilling and even all around better as a film.<br /><br />I thought that the story line was very well put together even though it was pretty cleshea, everything seemed to fall in place pretty well and there was alot of falling action that led up to the climax very well. I think one more bad thing about this film is it's predictability<br /><br />Overall I must say that I was pretty impressed with Wes Cravens new style and directoral effort in this roller coaster suspence ride ... I hope that "Red Eye" will lead to more good films by Craven the near future, Recommended to all ... well most.<br /><br />Grade: B+</p></br><a href="../users/A2PIX2K56IZZYX.html">A2PIX2K56IZZYX</a><br/><p>Ya, he pretty much did, the director of some of the better horror/suspense movies of the past few years, the Scream trilogy, Cursed, and of course Elm Street, managed only a few yawns from me this time out. The two leads are fine, Rachel McAdams, who is everywhere these days, plays Lisa. McAdams is very pretty and a decent actress, she played this well, but the script really didn't let her do much. Most of the credit goes to Cillian Murphy (If you remember he was the scarecrow in Batman Begins, another yawn inducer) I liked that he played this evil character with a slight human side, not all terrifying and cold like we usually see. But, even his cool performance couldn't save this from being just boring and not very suspensefull.<br /><br />I found it really hard to believe that this movie could waste the talent of one of Hollywood's most under-rated and one of my personal favorite actors, Brian Cox. This man always brings it to his roles, specially when he plays a baddie. But this time he plays Lisa's dad and had very few scenes, and worse yet, the few he was in were weak and pointless. If you ever want to really enjoy Brian Cox, I strongly, strongly recommend an X-Box game called Manhunt, he does the voice for Starkweather, a real low human being, it's mesmerizing, I swear.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Lisa taking a Red-Eye flight to get home after the funeral of her grandmother only to be sitting next to a  highly intelligent, yet very dangerous 'hitman'. Seems he was hired to kill the head of Homeland Security, who just happens to be staying at the hotel Lisa is a manager of. If she does not help him, he will have his partner kill her dad as he is stationed just outside his house sitting in a parked BMW. Of course she attempts to let someone on the plane secretly know what's going on, but Murphy catches her everytime. This all leads to a very poor ending with no suspense build-up at all.<br /><br />I love and own almost every single Wes Craven title, I think the first Scream and the Nightmare series are some of the finest horror movies ever, but I will not buy this, and I know it did fairly decent at the box-office (58 million for a horror movie is pretty good) But I hope Craven is not planning a sequel, like he usually does. Maybe we could get a sequel to Cursed, which was a far better horror movie then Red Eye. Upon returning this and Serenity, I rented Venom and Transporter 2, so I'll see all of ya real soon..........<br /><br />acting........3.5 stars, McAdams is awesome, Murphy too, But Cox is sooooo wasted<br /><br />directing.......2.5 stars, Pretty boring stuff from Mr. Craven<br /><br />special effects.....2 stars, Poor, what little there is<br /><br />horror rating.....1.5 stars, No suspense or chills at all<br /><br />quality......3 stars, Craven's movies always look good, not his best here, but not terrible.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>A good satisfing suspense thriller. I really enjoyed it from start to finish. The story is satisfing about a women who is terized on a plane by an madman who is ploting an assasion. The film is suspensfull but we all know what the outcome will be i the end but it's a thriller. The acting is the greates thing about this thriller Rachel McAddems is great and Cillan Murphy is great. The directing is great. Overall it's a good suspensfull film that should entertain all.</p></br><a href="../users/A34VV92TSLC37R.html">A34VV92TSLC37R</a><br/><p>I think Wes Craven is a good filmmaker.  However, I would only consider myself a fan of two or three of his films.  Other than A Nightmare On Elm Street and Scream, Craven has stuck mostly to cheaper films, that don't scare as well.  Such as Cursed and Vampire in Brooklyn.<br /><br />However, I was still excited to see Red Eye when I found out that Craven was directing.  Also, the teaser trailer that was first shown did an amazing job.  You thought the whole time you were about to see a preview for a romantic comedy, but then the music and look changed and all you were given was the title and some catch phrases, with no plot revelation whatsoever.  From the moment I saw that trailer, I wanted to see Red Eye.<br /><br />The movie itself is very, very good.  Not just plot-wise, either.  This thriller is brilliantly acted, directed, and (most importantly) paced.  Just about anyone can agree that most thrillers are dragged out to around 2 hours or more trying to make the story more in-depth when they are really just boring the viewer (Constant Gardener, anyone?)  Red Eye does no such thing.  At a brisk 80 minutes, Red Eye gets straight to the point and never lets the viewer go once the thrills have started.<br /><br />Basic plot overview: Lisa Reisert is the manager of a luxury hotel in Miami, where a new Homeland Security official is a regular.  On her way back to Miami from Dallas (grandmother's death) she encounters Jackson Rippner at the airport and, after a drink, finds him sitting next to her on the plane.  Once takeoff is over, Jackson reveals himself as a "manager" who wants Lisa to call her hotel and change the official's room number when he arrives at the hotel.<br /><br />What unfolds after that point is a thrilling, entertaining cat-and-mouse between Lisa and Jackson on the plane.  The confined atmosphere of the airplane cabin really adds a good element to the film, as well.  Craven uses mostly close-up, intense shots of the characters, so the viewer can really feel like they are right there, experiencing everything along with Lisa.<br /><br />Rachel McAdams does a good job of playing a vulnerable, but yet strong-willed woman who is not willing to give up control of herself for any reason.  Cillian Murphy plays his second straight awesome villain (after Batman Begins) and does a great job of exuding a calm, inviting presence before the flight, and an intense, professional, brutal personality once he gets down to business.<br /><br />A great psychological thriller with great performances, and a couple of good action sequences near the end, Red Eye makes good viewing for any Friday night.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>What a relief ... a thriller that actually is thrilling! New "IT" girl Rachel McAdams ("Wedding Crashers" and "The Notebook") dominates screen time in this nice little classic suspense thriller from famed horror film director Wes Craven. Craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers on the plane.<br /><br />What makes this one work is the realism of the first 15-20 minutes as we see McAdams interact with 4 or 5 people either in person or on the phone. She is a natural. When she meets Cillian Murphy (the Scarecrow in "Batman Begins") in what appears to be happenstance, the film really takes flight. Watching the two yuppie-types flirt while the audience knows something evil is brewing, is bewitching film-making! The plane boarding sequence is mesmerizing and the 30 plus minutes onboard is excruciatingly claustrophobic. Craven keeps us guessing as to the involvement of others and if anyone will come to her rescue.<br /><br />As with many thrillers, the only letdown occurs during the climax when the lamb turns into a superhero. An interesting plot device leads us to believe little Rachel has the necessary pent up frustration to see this through, but we can't help but cringe a bit. The most overdone scenes involve irate hotel guests, an annoying airline passenger, Cillian's injury and the FX at the hotel. The strength of the film is in the character development and psychological games between the leads. Sadly the fine screen veteran Brian Cox is under-utilized, but overall this is an above-average suspense thriller worth seeing for all but the finale.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>As far as all the action takes place in a plane, this film reminded me of recent "Flightplan". But what distinguishes "Red Eye" from the latter is some really profound characters' study. For some reason Jody Foster's film was a one night stand for me, but I really enjoyed "Red Eye" and I think I'm gonna enjoy it again one day. The script is very well written, the characters are vivid and lively, and director's work gives away a real professional. Wes Craven is a true professional, although he used to make low-budget horror movies that sometimes were silly and naive. But now we see that given if not a megabudget, but a pretty decent one, he can make good cinema without a lot of effort seemingly. Once he already made an excellent film with big money involved (I'm talking about "Wes Craven's New Nightmare") and now he proved he can create an interesting and exciting flick in other genre. Craven works great, I'm sure he'd shoot an awesome love story if he has to.<br />"Red Eye" is everything a good thriller should be - it's intense and gripping, it's surprising and very well crafted. The moment when you realise what's going on is done so perfect, I felt shivers down my spine.<br />The casting is just outstanding, and that's another Craven's merit. The film could have done much more worse with big stars, so Craven took rather well-known actors, but not THAT big. Rachel McAdams is very pretty on one hand, on the other she can really act, and you feel some inner strength in her. Cillian Murphy is just beyond any praise, I sincerely think this guy has a tremendous future as an actor.<br />I'm not sure you'll like "Red Eye" that much to buy it on DVD, but it is definately worth a walk to a theater or a DVD-rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A31D8QKJXU93BT.html">A31D8QKJXU93BT</a><br/><p>"Red Eye" was a snappy summer surprise, a tightly-written and gore-free thriller from the unlikeliest of directors, horror maven Wes Craven. Like the film that followed it, "Flightplan" with Jodie Foster, "Red Eye" pits a resourceful hero (Rachel McAdams) against foul villainy in a plane at 30,000 feet. A little girl, a helpful man and flight attendants play pivotal parts in both pictures. And both women ultimately triumph combining superior intelligence with physical prowess. Foster knows her way around a psychological thriller, but for Craven, principal of Slasher High, this is new territory.<br /><br />His fluid camera, relentless pace and acute take on the genre pay off in performance, even in the supporting roles. Boyish Irish actor Cillian Murphy has a dreamy jawline and is charming until his close-up (those chill blue eyes.) McAdams looks lovely but too young to be managing a luxury hotel. No matter; both nail their characters with economy and suspend any disbelief. Seasoned pro Brian Cox, as her father, comes to the rescue. Surprise and suspense are as elevated in "Red Eye" as the big studio-built airliner. If Craven finds another cast and script as savvy as these, a new career awaits him.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>Both this movie and Flight Plan came out at roughly the same time, and they both have that main ingredient necessary to make a classic mystery thriller. They both take place in enclosed spaces. With Agatha Christie, it always used to be the old manor house, specifically the library (where the body would be found). Now with movies like Red Eye, we have that ideal claustrophobic setting provided by an airplane. There's no escape. You're locked in there with the villain.<br /><br />In this case, the villain is truly scary. The individual playing that part almost changes facial contours - from initial affability, with just a hint of the sinister - to a physiognamy of outright Hyde-like evil.<br /><br />All the other actors do similarly admirable jobs with their roles.<br /><br />The movie has a rather lame ending - with the usual bloody confrontation between good and evil. But the ride itself is well worth the fare.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>Rachel McAdams plays a hotel manager flying back home to Miami after her grandmother's funeral. She meets a man in line and begins a flirtatious conversation. When she boards the plane, it seems serendipity has placed them in seats aside one another. After the plave takes off, however, the man reveals that he is working for someone who wants to assassinate a high ranking government official who just happens to be arriving at the hotel McAdams manages. She is the only one with the authority to change the official's room to the specific one the killers want him in. He also reveals that their is a man sitting outside her father's house. If she doesn't cooperate, her father will be killed. McAdams spends the flight trying to find a way to keep her father alive, but also not comply with the killers.<br /><br />Red Eye is short compared to most movies these days but is just the right length for a thriller like this. There are no wasted scenes and a lot of talking that doesn't get you anywhere. There is just enough character set-up so you can feel for McAdams and Cillian Murphy does a nice job of underplaying his hitman character. He's nasty enough that you believe he could hurt you, but he doesn't chew the scenery the way some actors would have. I found Red Eye to be a taut, well-acted and written thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>Red Eye doesn't have many ambitions beyond being the ultimate "bad guy to sit next to on an airplane" story. It's like an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents given a slightly longer running time.<br /><br />Fortunately, Rachel McAdams, who has to carry this film, does an admirable job of doing so, without the sort of "look at this great performance" stuff a bigger name might well have given us. And that elevates this bit of fluff into being quite impressive fluff.<br /><br />Fun stuff, and a film that should definitely keep McAdams' star on the rise and help director Wes Craven get more chances to spread his wings without Freddy Kruger around.<br /><br />A definite recommendation for thriller fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>Watched this one the other night at home.  I think Wes Craven delivers a nice tight movie.  He doesn't seem to waste a single moment in this film.  While it is listed as 85 minutes long, if you take out the credits, it is about 77 minutes.  Good acting all around, and some nice humorous characters to keep things from being too much.  The idea is very simple, a woman boards a flight, a man sits next to her and tells her that her father will die if she doesn't help him to assassinate a political figure.  The tension on the late night flight is very good, when they land, the movie becomes less special.  I would probably give this one an extra 1/2 star.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KL7NXOAGKD3U.html">A3KL7NXOAGKD3U</a><br/><p>This movie is definately one of those that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

In some ways I felt a little cheated because it's so short, but it's made up to us by being thrilling and captivating.  You want to know who the guy is that is taunting Lisa Reisert (Rachael McAdams), and what he wants.  How did it come to be that he sat next to her on the flight and how does he know about her family and job etc?  He's deliciously creepy.  It's well written and makes you sit on the edge of your seat.  While I'm not some feminist, it was refreshing to watch a movie like this, and not have the main female character scream all the time - but fight back.  There are some great funny lines in here, and overall the storyline itself is good.  It's never the type of movie that will win an Oscar, but for a little bit of escapism, this is great.

Very thrilling and a lot fun. Go check it out right now!</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>Wes Craven's "Red Eye" is a quick, tense, efficient little thriller, all setup and payoff. It works because it aspires to pump your blood, and does. At ninety minutes, you can do dinner-and-a-movie and conceivably get home before dawn.<br /><br />The plot is thankfully spare. Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy), an operative for a terrorist group, forces plucky hotel manager Lisa (Rachael McAdams) to help assasinate the podium-pounding chief of Homeland Security. How? By putting a hitman outside her father's house, Rippner offers Lisa a choice: Call her hotel from a red eye flight to change the chief's room assignment; or hold a funeral for her dad.<br /><br />Carl Ellworth's script milks what it can out of the first suspense - Lisa making the call - and then erects a chase when the plane lands to save the chief and Lisa's father( the estimable Brian Cox, who probably spent a whole day on the set, and invaribly will be the guy all the other actors were honored to meet in the DVD commentary). The script is clever and concise - it cares not for the motives of the terrorist group, nor does it dawdle on Lisa's personal life. If you want to read into Rippner's casual misogyny, and Lisa's eventual response, go ahead. "Red Eye" tacks a footnote onto the gender debate but doesn't berate the point.<br /><br />Instead, it enjoys the lead performances. Murphy is fine as one of those bemused, malevolent types who talk in complete sentences but would really like to crush skulls. He becomes one of those limping caricatures of evil in the final act, his state perfectly underlined by a single line from Lisa.<br /><br />McAdams does a lot of face acting - she produces some serious waterworks - and generally represents the cute, casual everywoman. Pretty. Fashionable. Loyal. Sweet. Courteous. Good with a weapon.<br /><br />Combine this with her role in "Wedding Crashers" and she's the big winner in an average summer movie season, casting a surprising shadow on her "Mean Girls" co-star Lindsay Lohan, who generally become a walking tabloid since that film. There is precedent for this: Justine Bateman was the young star of "Satisfaction" way back when. But it's Julia Roberts rescuing a rotten Dave Matthews Band CD in 2005.</p></br><a href="../users/A155KXFRZCA7C.html">A155KXFRZCA7C</a><br/><p>This flick is certainly carried by the acting performances of the two leading actors, McAdams and Murphy. Both play excellent. In a way, this movies seems like an adaptation of a stage play, but the last part of the film, off the plane in the city of Miami, changes that idea a bit. The general plot of this film which creates the threatening situations for Lisa (McAdams) is somewhat interesting, but plays a secondary role. The emphasis is clearly on the initiations, responses and reactions of the two leading actors. The soundtrack is also well done in the beginning of this flick, but becomes less prevalent as the film moves on.<br /><br />It seems as if this movie is too short and most moviegoers may desire the film to be expanded by another 10-15 minutes. The concept of "Red Eye" is very interesting and the execution is okay, although there are some loose ends. Anyway, it's a nice Saturday afternoon flick to relax and to watch an almost "classic" thriller, while watching two first-class actors do an excellent job.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>How good could it be? It's only an hour and a half, right? Well, it is really good. You don't even notice the time as a factor. I thought, going in, that this movie was going to be too short to notice a thing. But it is quite the opposite. Here, you have a good combination of the necassary elemnts of a thriller. Rachael Mcadams is a very naturalistic actress. And the man that she meets is equally gifted in the acting field. He's one of those universal joints of actors. A man that can play any role. Though, after this one, he might be typecast to do roles leaning more towards villians.<br /><br />It all starts with a normal, everyday, hotel manager who's flying back home. Whilst waiting for the plane she meets a friendly stranger who instantly clicks with her. He's even seated right next to her on the plane. What a coincidence! It is right when we learn more of the woman's history that we are delved into a hyper-tension acition thriller that is smart, fast, and very go for the throat surprises. You'll be on the edge of your seat. Be sure to keep the tray tables up. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Red-Eye" is great! This is one of Wes Craven's best films since "Scream". Rachel McAdams (Lisa Reisert) and Cillian Murphy (Jackson Rippner) are great in their roles. The screenplay by Carl Ellsworth and the story by Ellsworth and Dan Foos is excellent. The music by Marco Beltrami (who also composed the score to the Scream movies and Cursed) is excellent. The cinematography by Robert D. Yeoman is great. The film editing by Stuart Levy & Patrick Lussier (who has also edited the last 7 movies of Craven's) is great. The casting by Lisa Beach (who also did the casting for the Scream movies and Cursed) & Sarah Katzman (who also did the casting for Craven's Cursed) is great. The production design by Bruce Alan Miller (who also did the production design for Scream & Scream 3, and also did the production design for Music Of The Heart and Cursed) is excellent. The art direction by Andrew Max Cahn (who also did the art direction for Cursed) is excellent. The set decoration by Maggie Martin is excellent. The costume design by Mary Claire Hannan is excellent. This is a suspense thriller that is well-executed and gives Craven an excellent chance to do more suspense thrillers. I, somewhat, was not surprised by Craven's transition into suspense thrillers, because of his ability to make people think and his ability to scare people.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Who would expect a screenplay/story by Carl Ellsworth ('Buffy the Vampire Slayer') directed by horror master Wes Craven to be an intelligent thriller?  Yet RED EYE is precisely that.  This a tight conversational duet for two actors with accompaniment that slips up on the viewer so surely that the terrifying climax is somewhat of a relief from the preceding tension.<br /><br />Rachael McAdams as the heroine proves she can sustain a fine character development from first appearance through the suspense to the last screen frame.  Likewise, Cillian Murphy uses not only his talent as an actor but also his clear blue-eyed innocence to foreshadow the evil underneath.  Since the majority of the film takes place aboard an airplane in flight (the red eye from Texas to Miami), the tension for the story rests heavily with these two actors.  They succeed in every way, as does Craven in turning his directorial skills to intellectual rather than physical terror.  Well done! Grady Harp, January 06</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Lisa (Rachel McAdams, "Wedding Crashers", "The Notebook"), the manager of the Lux Atlantic hotel in Miami, is very late for her plane in Dallas. Shaking the rain off, she stands in line at the airport terminal and meets Jackson (Cillian Murphy, "Batman Begins", "28 Days Later"). Jackson calms a tense situation with another passenger and then introduces himself, telling Lisa that he will be in the bar, waiting for the plane, if she cares to join him. She politely begs off but does end up having a drink with him. As Lisa boards the plane, she finds that she is sitting next to Jackson. The plane takes off and Lisa becomes nervous, because she hates to fly prompting Jackson to try to calm her, by getting her to talk about her dad, Joe (Brian Cox). After the plane has lifted through the turbulence, he reveals that he knows a lot more about Lisa than he should and he simply needs Lisa to make a phone call. If she does, her dad will not be harmed by the man sitting outside of his house.<br /><br />"Red Eye" directed by Wes Craven ("Cursed", the "Scream" films, "Nightmare Before Elm Street") is a very good example of the thriller genre.<br /><br />I think the first trailer released for this film is a brilliant piece of marketing. The trailer paints the film as a nice, romantic drama featuring a chance meeting between Lisa and Jackson. They meet in the airport, they have a snack together, then, lo and behold, they find they are sitting next to each other. The flight will be a pleasant affair. Just as the trailer has convinced you of this, a title card appears announcing "A Film by Wes Craven", in red lettering, and the music becomes ominous. The trailer is so brilliant, because it so completely convinced me that the film would be a romantic drama before switching gears, that my hopes were raised for this film.<br /><br />"Red Eye" has a lot going for it. Not the least of its attributes is that the film is very brisk and clocks in at about 85 minutes long. This provides Craven with little room for lingering on anything and he keeps things moving. The subplot, which begins before we even meet Lisa, is introduced with a series of brief shots depicting the machinations of a group who need Lisa's help. These shots are quick, informative and interesting. Then the main story kicks in and we leave this group for a while.<br /><br />When we meet Lisa, you might think the film would seem to slow down a little, but upon reflection, I realized that every scene has at least two purposes in the plot. The initial encounter between Lisa and Jackson, in line at the ticket counter, would seem to serve only one purpose, to introduce the two characters to one another. Later in the film, one of the characters involved makes a brief reappearance. In fact, many of the minor characters are introduced and we learn a little bit about their characters. In some way or fashion, they will all have another moment or two to either help or complicate the journey of Lisa and Jackson.<br /><br />Because all of these minor characters are given a `history', the film rises above the rest of the pack. Most films don't even bother with minor characters, using them simply as window dressing. In "Red Eye", they become a part of the story. An older flight attendant complains to her co-worker about a broken coffee pot and the company stealing her pension from her. A little girl is flying alone for the first time. An elderly woman strikes up a conversation with Lisa about the Dr. Phil book her father loaned her. A woman flirts insistently with Jackson asking for his help with her bag. All of this may seem like busy work, but Craven and the writers, Carl Ellsworth and Dan Foos tie it all back to the plot and make them a part of the story. Because of this level of detail, the film is, ultimately, stronger.<br /><br />The relationship between Lisa and Jackson is intriguing and interesting to watch. Lisa isn't the normal helpless heroine. She reveals that she may be a little tougher than Jackson hoped and ultimately becomes a more interesting adversary to him. Jackson is also quietly menacing, quick to smile to someone on the plane who may have noticed them, to assuage their concerns, to make them invisible again. Speaking in low tones, he makes it clear that he will carry out his threats.<br /><br />The movie becomes a bit more standard after the plane lands in Miami. Part of the reason the film works is that the two characters are in the middle of a sea of people in a confined airplane chamber. Once the plane lands, their world expands and there are many other influences upon each of their actions. The finale is pretty standard for thrillers and less than spectacular, dragging the rest of the film down. But thankfully, this section is also very briskly paced and over quickly.<br /><br />"Red Eye" suffers from a lackluster final 10 minutes, but it is still far above average for a film in this genre. Definitely worth a bargain matinee.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>I wanted to like this. I generally love Wes Craven. I generally love suspense. And while this was "an action packed thrill ride". It was a very flawed movie.<br /><br />I did enjoy it. It's not by any means unwatchable, but it is implausible to the point where I couldn't stop laughing at the insane twists by the end of the film. Unfortunately, since the first 2/3 or so of the film were set up so well - very gritty, realistic, suspenseful, and very evocative of helplessness, that made the last part of the movie that much stupider. Suddenly we've gone from a creditable Hitchcock pastiche to a Warner Brothers cartoon. If it had been goofy all the way through, it would have been better than switching styles in mid-stream.<br /><br />Also, while I like Wes Craven, he's got some serious issues - for one thing, the main two characters look AND ACT almost exactly like Sydney and Billy from Scream, and the dichotomy (she good/he bad) is identical, it just becomes clear a lot earlier. Wes needs to play with his own stereotypes and make a BAD brunette GIRL for a change.<br /><br />RED EYE is the kind of movie that fails, but has enough talent and good charm. It tries hard with very little and in the end will probably be considered one the most riveting and yet forgettable movies of 2005.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>"Red Eye" is a fast-paced thriller directed by Wes Craven, who also directed the fabulous "Scream" trilogy. In "Red Eye," a young hotel manager named Lisa (Rachel McAdams) is kidnapped by a man (Cillian Murphy) she encounters on a late flight to Miami. The strange man is part of a plot to assassinate a Homeland Security official (Jack Scalia) at the hotel where Lisa works. Lisa is instructed to call the hotel and arrange to have the government official's room switched, making it easier for the assassination plot to be carried out. There's a hit man sitting outside the home of Lisa's father, and if Lisa refuses to comply with her hostage, her father will be killed.<br /><br />Overall, this is a pretty decent movie. It clocks in at only 85 minutes long, which is brilliant: Craven constantly keeps the action moving, and there isn't a dull moment in the film. Both McAdams and Murphy deliver excellent performances in their roles and have great onscreen chemistry together. I was pretty turned off by almost every other actor in the film, though: all the other performances seemed very overdone, which must have been a deliberate choice on Craven's part, but I found it kind of annoying.<br /><br />This is an entertaining and suspenseful film. It's not up there with my favorite thrillers of all time and I doubt I'll ever watch it again, but "Red Eye" kept me thoroughly entertained for 85 minutes of my life.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>If you like psychological thrillers, this flick is worth checking out.  It was directed by Wes Craven. You remember him, right?  He used to mainly do horror flicks such as the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET series.  This movie proves that his talents are more diverse than some may have imagined.<br /><br />The star of the show, however, is Rachel McAdams.  She is an up-and-coming starlet in Hollywood and I'm a HUGE fan of her's.  She is absolutely gorgeous, AND she has remarkable acting abilities AND (on top of all that!) she has  a genuine screen presence.  In the latter two regards, she's basically the antithesis of Paris Hilton.  Also, every time I see her in a movie I have this insatiable appetite to give her a great big hug as she's so adorable.  :)<br /><br />In this film, she plays a vulnerable hotel manager who has a very rude person sitting next to her on a redeye flight.  Doesn't sound like a big deal, right?  Well, in this case she finds out that she must decide matters of life and death.  If this piques your curiousity, pick up the DVD!<br /><br />I do hope that Ms. McAdams flourishes in Hollywood, and I see no reason why she shouldn't.  Of course, I thought Tawny Kitean had a lot of potential early in her career too, but she never made nearly as many movies as I would have liked.  Hopefully Ms. McAdams will be around for the long-haul.  Too many Hollywood film stars base too much on their physical good-looks and too little on their acting skills.  This actress is an exception to that unfortunate rule!</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>The last few times we've seen the words "directed by Wes Craven" on anything, it hasn't really been anything to write home about.  From the Scream trilogy to the debacle that was Cursed, it seemed like Craven had lost his edge.  The man who brought us terrifying, exploitation films like Last House on the Left and the Hills Have Eyes, along with the classic Nightmare on Elm Street, may not go for the throat like he used to, but Red Eye is as close a return to form for the director that we'll get for a while.  Hottie Rachel McAdams stars as a hotel manager catching the red eye flight back home, and soon enough she turns the tables on the psychopath (Cillian Murphy, more menacing and eerie looking than in Batman Begins if you can believe that) looking to assassinate her father (Brian Cox).  There's really nothing we haven't seen before in Red Eye, but under Craven's guiding hand the tension and suspense are superbly crafted.  McAdams and Murphy are quite good as well, and the film is short but sweet, clocking in at under an hour and a half.  All in all, there may well be hope yet for Craven's future films, and anyone looking for some great suspense should definitely check this out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>interesting but short, i like it the suspence and the thrill of it the actor who played the bad guy Cillian Murphy just his eyes alone send chills through my body..<br /><br />Not a bad movie just really shortish...</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>`Red Eye' is a good example that proves you can make a riveting thriller with moderate amount of money if you have A) more than one talented actors and B) first-rate director who knows the genre. Here we have Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy for A and Wes Craven for B, and none of them would disappoint you in this above-average thriller.<br /><br />The film's intriguing premise (by the first-time writer Carl Ellsworth) is simply this; Lisa (McAdams) sits next to one charming guy Jackson Rippner (Murphy) on a delayed flight to Miami. Nothing is wrong with this bumpy flight except that Jackson is actually a freelance assassin who orders Lisa - obviously a very competent but otherwise ordinary working lady -- to do something that concerns national security.<br /><br />The lean film has only 85 minutes, and has no sub-plot about, say, Lisa's boyfriend. Her daddy appears, played by Brian Cox, who plays an important role by mostly staying out of the screen, but the film's best moments happen in the claustrophobic sequences on the airplane, heightened by the convincing acting from the two leads. The fact is `Red Eye' is most powerful when the camera decides to show the close-ups of the two in the confined space of the flying plane, which was totally missing from `Flight Plan.'<br /><br />`Red Eye' has lots of conventions of thriller, but Craven uses them cleverly without trying to hide that fact from the audiences. Instead, he embraces them, and even enjoying doing them. That's exactly what we need because we are watching this film for fun, and Craven knows it. The long wrap-up part looks to me rather silly, with our heroine holding a hockey stick, but even then the film remains watchable thanks to the excellent performances from the two rising stars of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2O97GKCSISM3F.html">A2O97GKCSISM3F</a><br/><p>When it comes to terrorist plots, this could be one of my favorites. Air Force One was good, but Gary Oldman's charecter repeatedly infuriated me!<br />This film intrigued me because I saw `a Wes Craven film' on the case, so being on sale on my fye, I had to try it.<br />Rachel McAdams-this being my first intro with her, did a very nice job, and Cillian Murphy-who starts out so quiet and nice, does a subtle jekyll and hyde twist in seconds, very frightning, but still convincing.<br />Wes Craven displays almost no bloodshed, but does an excellent job. How it managed to be so short and PG-13, I'm not sure. Only complaint about the DVD is there's no trailer, other than that, it was great! Kudos to Wes Craven for taking on a different genre-for him, and still doing a great job with it! Thank you, Wes!</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>One look at the running time of this movie (only 85 minutes) and you know you're not going to see a movie of much substance.  This is a one trick movie, the plot is just what you expect, there are no twists and turns.  Still, its not a bad film.  The strenghth of the movie is between lead actors Rachel McAdams (Wedding Crashers) and Cillian Murphy.  They meet while their flight from Dallas to Miami is delayed.  They hit it off and have a great relationship and even end up sitting together on the plane.  Coincidence?  No, of course not.<br /><br />Murphy quickly reveals he has alterior motives.  His job is to force McAdams to call the hotel where she works and have a important political figure's room changed to one easily accessible to assassins.  To make things worse, bad guys have McAdam's dad and if she doesn't obey, he'll be killed.<br /><br />I liked this movie and at the same time it was disappointing.  It was short and the plot was as basic as they come.  There were some tense moments and Rachel McAdams and Murphy were fun to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was stunned.  Was Wes Craven actually making a serious movie again? Apparently so.  However, I'm actually more forgiving of Craven's recent material than many  serious horror fans, as I actually liked all the 'Scream' movies (Even though they're about 1/10 as clever as they think they are), and found 'Cursed' to be passably entertaining, even if it was undeniably crappy.  Still, quasi-parodic horror films have never really been my bag, and I was definitely getting pretty tired of them, so it's nice to say one of the main purveyors of that sorta thing has gone straight, again.  Now, 'Red-Eye' isn't great, by any, means, but it's well made and well acted and tightly plotted and paced.  That's enough.<br /><br />As you probably already know, 'Red-Eye' is about Lisa Reisert, a hotel manager whose accosted on a plane by Jackson Rippner, a terrorist who wants her to move Homeland Security chief Keefe to a different room, presumably to allow him to be assassinated more readily.  If she doesn't do this, Jackson's cohorts will kill Lisa's father.  That's really about all there is to it, and it's, naturally, about Lisa's trying to prevent either deaths, and communicate her situation to others etc.  As noted before, this film is extremely efficient, as  it's about 75 minutes long if you don't include the credits  Most thriller or horror films have a bit of tiresome filler, somewhere, but 'Red-Eye' has virtually none, setting up the premise cleanly and giving us little information we don't need.  (For example, I like how we never learn who Jackson is and why he wants to kill Keefe, because, seriously, what difference does it make.)  Yet, it also avoids making Lisa a completely hollow, faceless character, unlike so many thriller or horror protagonists. (And she's certainly more likable than Neve Campbell or Christina Ricci were in Craven's last few films)<br /><br />The key to the film is Cillian Murphy's fantastic performance as Jackson.  I first saw Cillian in the brilliant movie '28 Days Later', where he was the protagonist, but he's moved onto villainy now.  He was pretty cool in 'Batman Begins', but he definitely takes it to the next level here, providing your classic menacing, but also charismatic and cool villain, all while still seeming to be essentially human. Of course, this leads to a minor caveat: Jackson is more charismatic and intriguing than Lisa, so I was generally rooting for him, making it somewhat frustrating when he's repeatedly foiled.<br /><br />Many have complained about the final act of this movie.  It takes place on the ground, at Lisa's home, and is fairly conventional.  Frankly, this  could easily pass for the  ending of a slasher film, where Lisa runs about the house and fights Jackson with various household items.  Again, I have seen this ending plenty of times before, but it still works. And, it is particularly well done, if for no other reason than the characters involved are better drawn and more interesting than they'd usually be. (And, for once the film has a reason why the protagonist wouldn't just run the hell outta there. i.e. if she does, her unconscious father will be left at Jackson's mercy)  And yeah, some of the events leading up to this are highly unlikely, but I've seen plausibility stretched plenty further a hundred times before.<br /><br />As usual, Craven's direction is nothing particularly flashy, just with lotsa tight, claustrophobic close-ups while they're on the the plane.  And, when they actually get back to the house, the scene is a lot more coherent than that sorta thing usually is.<br /><br />Lastly, the film has a few attempts at humor, most of which are extremely lame.  But again, there isn't much.<br /><br />Well that's it.  Not a brilliant film, but a sufficiently intriguing scenario and a great performance from Murphy.  Definitely worth checking out.<br /><br />Grade: B</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>"Red Eye" is an airborne thriller about a young woman (the stunning Rachel McAdams) who meets a stranger (Cillian Murphy) in an airport, and sparks instantly fly.  A short time later, she isn't too upset to find that they're seated together on the same plane.  The initial attraction isn't helped along too much, though, when the stranger whispers a dark secret about himself.<br /><br />  The initial set-up has so much potential it would almost be hard for the filmmakers to mess it up, but the question was would it be able to hold up that edge-of-the-seat tension with the entire next hour (approximately) of the movie taking place with the two characters aboard a plane, usually seated right next to each other, without a high level of physical action.  Fortunately, the answer was an unequivocal Yes, with things not dragging or losing momentum for one minute.  It took a lot of skill to put this together, and McAdams and Murphy both deliver standout performances.  "Red Eye" is consistently innovative, quicker-paced than one might think by its premise, and believable.  It makes some nice swerves along the way, and nails the finale dead-on.  Among director Wes Craven's best in years and years, this one gets a strong 8.5/10</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>I was misled by the trailer that this film was going to be a horror film since it's Wes Craven's work, but it turned out to be more like Before Sunrise meets Flight Plan. Considered that Red Eye doesn't have star powers like Jodie Foster and Peter Sarsgaard, it still managed to be a pretty watchable thriller. Yes, I must admit that I am glad to see Canadian darling actress Rachel McAdams rising beyond her Mean Girls images and playing some heavy-duty emotional and physical scenes opposite Cillian Murphy, the ultimate villian player these days. Murphy is very convincing as the evil and vicious hyjacker. McAdams is very good playing her role which goes from totally confident and in control to becoming terrified and vulnerable. Brian Cox is rather wasted with insignificant role and underexposed as McAdams' father. There's limited amount of special effects and action taken place during this film and it's the headgames between the two leads that makes this film more worthwhile, but the ending is the part that failed to satisfy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PMQH87R1H3QU.html">A2PMQH87R1H3QU</a><br/><p>I saw this movie few days and ago and bought it for my DVD collection! ...Real good thriller, have a lots tense, suspense moments.

The two performances that the movie focuses on almost the entire time is that of Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy. Rachel McAdams is a cutie with a gorgeous smile, but she also shows a wide range of emotions here (she goes from just a regular nice girl to a kick butt action star by the closing of the film). Cillian Murphy is really perfect here. As in Batman Begins, he hits all the creepy notes dead on and is probably one of the most believable villians to come on screen in a while. Without these two in the roles that seem written just for them, the movie would likely have been less effective in more ways than one. Red Eye runs a little under 90 minutes and never lets you catch your breath once the plane is off the ground.<br /><br />4.5 out of 5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Red Eye is Wes Craven's attempt at making a suspense movie and he pulls it off fine. This isn't the first time he proved he can make more than just horror movies though. He also made a drama with Merryl Streep about 4 or 5 years back. Anyway it's called Red Eye because that's the name of the plane Rachel McAdams takes. Some trailers make the movie look supernatural. With Cillian Murphy eyes turning red like he's a demon or something that's taunting McAdams. No though this is just a thriller and he's just a normal guy. Well if you call a hitman a normal guy.<br /><br />  Anyway McAdams meets Murphy when the flight is delayed. She seems to like his company andc this could've became one of those romantic movies about a chance meeting. Since they have good chmestry. After getting on the plane she finds that she's seated next him as well. Soon after take off he reveils that he's going to have someone kill her dad if she doesn't do what he says. Since she has authority at an airline, she can move his targets room which would make him an easier to target.<br /><br />  Cillian Murphy (Batman Beging, 28 Days Later) and Rachel McAdams (The Notebook, Mean Girls, Wedding Crashers) give fine performances. He shows how evil and manipulative he is and she shows it's not gonna be as easy as he thought. She turns out to be both tough and smart. Unlike Murphy she'll go on to more romantic comedies and dramas and he'll probably be stuck type casted a villian. He is great as one though and probably even better here than he was in Batman Begins as the Scare Crow.<br /><br />  Brian Cox (X-2, 25th Hour) is a really good actor but here he's weak as her father. His performance is like something you'd get from a straight to video movie. I had to keep reminding myself that it was actually Brian Cox. Guess it's not really his fault. He wasn't really given a part worthy of him. Here he just answers the phone through most the movie and gets disconnected before she can warn him that he's in trouble. McAdams and Murphy give the best performances by far. They both are likeable. Murphy charms you and her in the beginning of the movie. Then he makes you afraid of him.  This isn't a bad movie for Craven either. Certainly better for his resume than Cursed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>Have you ever let your imagination run away with you? Perhaps you're sitting on a park bench and you see a jogger coming toward you and you wonder if maybe that jogger has a knife and is actually running aiming for you. That's the feeling I got when watching Red Eye-- an imaginative nightmare in which one bad thing leads to yet another bad thing. Someone's imagination apparently got the best of them when writing this movie. Yes, it's far-fetched, though that seems a petty reason to dislike this fun Friday night flick, as most movies are generally far-fetched.<br /><br />Rachel McAdams stars as Lisa, a hotel manager who's on a red eye flight back to Miami, the locale of her hotel as well as the place her father lives. In the airport, a friendly gentleman named Jack Rippner, ignore the silly, contrived name, (Cillian Murphy-- frightening in his aspect) buys the nervous flyer Lisa a drink before the flight. They part ways as their plane begins to board. But what do you know! Jack and Lisa are sitting next to each other. I love the trailer for this film. It's made to look like a romantic comedy, until the camera zooms in on Murphy's evil and powerfully piercing blue eyes. That's exactly what we get here: Jack is not a good person. As a matter of fact, he's going to kill Lisa's father if she refuses to authorize a change of room in her hotel for a politician, whom Jack is looking to assassinate.<br /><br />Very thrilling movie, great performances, especially from Murphy, though I don't expect anything less than creepy from him. The man radiates creepiness. Pictures of him make me cringe because I feel like his bright blue eyes are burning through my skin. A very fun film score as well; it works well, in all its hokiness, with the especially thrilling scenes. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY.html">A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY</a><br/><p>On the outset I'm going to give Wes Craven's new film "RED EYE" my wholehearted endorsement.  It's a well-made movie that shows off Craven's talent for gripping suspense.  There were moments that this film grabbed me.  Moments where I gripped my seat and gritted my teeth, and actually interacted with the film.  That is the Hallmark of a good thriller, even if the film itself isn't that good.<br /><br />RED EYE is the harrowing tale of a young woman named Lisa (Brooke Adams, Mean Girls) and a bright and yet whole heartedly inept "BAD GUY" named Jackson (Cillian Murphy, Batman Begins), who are brought together on a Red Eye between Texas and Miami. Unbeknownst to Lisa she's caught up in a political plot to kill the head of homeland security, and the only way to survive is to outsmart her captors.  I'd mention more, but I'd spoil the eventual outcome, or maybe not.<br /><br />The problem is that the whole film is on autopilot.  Everyone in the film is present and accounted for.  They all have a small piece in the puzzle.  RED EYE has one goal to get you to the end.  That's where the film fails.  It fails at a basic level where characters become plot points, and merely spout out dialogue to get from point A to point B.  If you can stand this, you'll be able to sit through the first half of the movie where mysteries are set up and briefly described away.  Where much fanfare is made of characters, who serve very little face time, and whose only goal is to get the story moving.  In fact there is a  little girl in the film whose whole point of being there is to kick a duffel bag.<br /><br />But wait hold on a sec......  You told me I should go see this movie and yes I agree you should. Does the film work? Sort of.  Do I think the movie succeeds in what it's doing? Yes, but  in a very shallow and one-dimensional way.  Is this film going to make and critics top 100 lists? No.  This is the kind of film you probably find in the $5.50 bin at Walmart two years from now.  It is utterly forgettable.<br /><br />But up there on the big screen, the suspense works.  The last 30 minutes of this film work perfectly.  It also includes one of the best chase scenes I've seen in a while, it's actually quite scary, and for once you feel for the Characters.  That's why you should see this movie.<br /><br />Cillian Murphy was miscast in the film.  He doesn't have a face you can trust.  From the outset he always looks like something is a bit off.  His character only works when he goes psychotic near the end and because the film doesn't waste time on his back-story and you're not quite sure what he has up his sleeve.  His motivations seem silly.  What is his motive? Why is he after Lisa?  What does fulfilling his ultimate objective have to do with any of this?  And most importantly why get a ton of people involved with a plan that at the very least will fail because it's just plain stupid? Without personal  motive he's just a brash guy who kidnaps a girl, and what's so interesting about that?  The part really calls for someone more charming.  This film needs a Brad Pitt and yet it gives us a poor man's Norman Bates.<br /><br />But Rachael McAdams shines as the young strong-willed women whose not afraid to talk back.  Some have said Ms. McAdams is my generation's Julia Roberts.  She just may be, but that is because she's good at what she does.  Her scenes in the airport near the end while preposterous work because she's believable.  Her performance overcomes the entire film, and adds some realism in a film that misses the mark so many times.<br /><br />The other thing the film fails on is consistent tone.  Some scenes are far too dark, and others way to light.  I guess it's the way to handle the material and still hold onto the  PG-13 rating.  But when Craven jumps from drama to comedy, it's a little to jarring for my taste.  It also ends on a dumb joke, that renders the film far silly for its own good.<br /><br />RED EYE is the kind of movie that fails, but has enough talent and good charm.  It tries hard with very little and in the end will probably be considered one the most riveting and yet forgettable movies of 2005.<br /><br />***1/2 out of 5</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Horror master Wes Craven does himself proud with this one. Red Eye is a lean suspense thriller, which benefits with a taut, snappy script, fine acting by Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy, and, of course, competent, no-nonsense directing by you-know-you.<br /><br />The film's plot centers around hotel manager Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) taking a delayed redeye flight to Miami after attending her grandmother's funeral. At the airport, she meets a helpful charmer by the name of Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy) and some kind of spark is lit. But, because this is a Craven film, all the flirty shenanigans soon give way to horrific cat-and-mouse tension as Lisa quickly becomes embroiled in a plot to assassinate a high level Homeland Security muckamuck (and his family) who happens to be staying at her hotel.<br /><br />This was an enjoyable little flick. At a quick-moving 85 minutes, Red Eye contains no excess fat. We are propelled from scene to purposeful scene as Lisa and Jackson meet kinda cute and have an airport flirtation, which culminates in the reveal that Jackson Rippner is an assassin, with Lisa's dad as one of his targets. Even though the first two thirds of the film is pretty much a two-person character study, comprising of an ongoing playful-then-tense chatfest between Lisa and Jackson, it never gets dull for the audience.<br /><br />Craven really knows how to ratchet up the pressure, as we feel Lisa's despair and helplessness in the face of Jackson's smiling, direct-talking menace. And, because these scenes take place inside the coach cabin, in front of other unknowing passengers, Lisa's attempts to maintain composure is all the more nerve-wracking and the more frustratingly felt by the audience. When Lisa locks herself in the restroom and finally has a chance to let go and cry it out, it serves to be a  cathartic scene. The film's stressful atmosphere was most heightened and best maintained during the airplane scenes, due in large part to the compressed surroundings. There actually was an easing of tension when Lisa disembarks and goes into full-blown action heroine mode. Another factor in the film's favor was that Craven paid attention to detail with regards to the other plane passengers, giving them throw away context. It just made the premise seem more real.<br /><br />Naturally, Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy deserve great credit for their nuanced performances. Murphy, with his icy blue eyes conveying menace, translates well into a villain (but we already knew that from his role of the Scarecrow in Bats Begins). His character has enough calculated charisma that his "chance" meeting with Lisa and her resulting attraction for him are entirely plausible. If people weren't yet convinced that Rachel McAdams can act, well, this is another character she fully sinks into. So far, I haven't seen her repeat a role. And, even more than Murphy, she carries this movie. Her Lisa Reisert is resilient and resourceful and immensely likable. Also worth mentioning is wide-eyed Jayma Mays as the beleaguered hotel clerk Cynthia, who, before the end credits roll, informs Lisa, "I think we had a really good night, all things considered - just that one incident, really." Brian Cox, however, is wasted here in a, for all intents and purposes, "damsel in distress" role.<br /><br />As for the special features, Red Eye has your typical ones: film commentary by the filmmakers (including director Wes Craven), a gag reel (the little girl is the funniest), a making-of featurette, and a segment focusing on Craven and his directing of Red Eye, "Wes Craven: A New Kind of Thriller."<br /><br />Red Eye is a study in brisk, exciting, professional filmmaking. I doubt it won any awards but I betcha it gains a cult following. My male-driven, fact-based logic tells me so.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>This is an excellent film.

Besides fine direction and plotting, Red Eye has a key element that's missing from many action movies: the actors are not well known.  Not that Red Eye has lots of surprises but at least the screen "personalities" of the actors cannot be anticipated.  They seem like real people, in a very bad situation.<br /><br />A great flight.  Short and sweet!</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Often times in Hollywood, film directors are forced into a rut in terms of the genre of films they direct.  It seems that a lot of times once a director directs a kid-friendly movie, a science fiction movie, or even an action film, that director will be branded that type of director for the remainder of his/her career.  The genre that is most notorious with this effect on director's careers would be the horror movie.  John Carpenter and Wes Craven being the two most popular directors that have always been branded horror directors.  Carpenter with his horror classics, "Halloween", "The Fog", and "The Thing", any time you hear the name John Carpenter you automatically think horror director.  Wes Craven is the same way, thanks in no small part to "A Nightmare On Elm Street", "New Nightmare", and the 'Scream' trilogy.  However, sometimes there are exceptions to the rule, and a director is able to escape the genre that has been his trademark for years, when this happens you know you'll be in for a unique movie-watching experience.  Because it is with these films that you get a new blend of two genres, the genre the director is most familiar with and whatever genre they are experimenting in for the first time.  Sometimes though it would be best for directors to stick to the genre they're best at; however, this is not the case for Wes Craven.  In 2005, Wes Craven stepped outside of the confines of horror films, and directed a white-knuckle thrill ride, "Red Eye", proving to critics and audiences that the difference between horror films and thrillers is merely a walk across the street.<br /><br />"Red Eye" takes place over the course of one day and night, when a very successful hotel manager, Lisa (Rachel McAdams) is forced to take the red-eye flight from somewhere in Texas back to her hotel in Miami because of a Homeland Security official who is coming into Miami and is staying in her hotel.  As the flight begins, the person sitting next to Lisa on the flight, a man named Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy), strikes up a conversation with Lisa that quickly turns from casual to creepy.  Jackson as it turns out is the middle-man in a plot to assassinate the very Homeland Security official that is staying in Lisa's resort, so he and his cohorts have devised a way to force Lisa into arranging everything at her hotel in a way that will leave the government official exposed and easier to assassinate.  As Lisa tries to outwit her apparent stalker, she is shown the one piece of leverage that the would be killers have that will stop Lisa in her tracks, her father will be killed if she will not comply.  Now, Lisa is in the fight for not only her life and the life of a government official, but also her father's.  All she has to rely on are her wits and courage, but will they be enough to save them all.<br /><br />Stepping outside of one's comfort zone has proved to be true box office gold for Wes Craven.  With incredible young actors Rachel McAdams ("The Notebook") and Cillian Murphy ("Batman Begins" and "28 Days Later"), alongside veteran actor Brian Cox ("Troy" and "The Bourne Identity"), fleshing out these characters in this well-written, incredibly tense thrill ride, Wes was sure to hit the bullseye.<br /><br />Though "Red Eye" does have an unusually short running time of around 82 minutes, it's probably the appropriate amount of time.  Since it's so short it allows Craven to constantly keep the atmosphere tense, and hardly allows for any down time for the audience to catch their collective breaths.  Sometimes keeping the intensity so high throughout the duration of a film works against the movie, for "Red Eye" it works to its advantage because of the shorter running time, and any sort of lull in the intensity would probably lower the thrill value of the film.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone looking for an intense thrill ride, that will leave you on the edge of your seats for the entire movie.  Definitely not a movie to be missed!<br /><br />"Red Eye" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Wes Craven<br /><br />Cast:  Rachel McAdams, Cillian Murphy, Brian Cox, Jayma Mays, Angela Paton, Laura Johnson, Suzie Plakson, Max Kasch, Jack Salia.<br /><br />Running Time:  85 minutes<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for some intense sequences of violence, and language.<br /><br />"Red Eye" is enjoyable nonsense that would be other wise be unbearable rubbish were it not for the two excellent leads, their chemistry and paced direction from that old pro Craven ("The Last House on the Left"). The plot is an entirely twist less piece of fluff and the script is equally lacking in complexity and depth.  Lisa (Rachel McAdams) Reisert is a people-pleaser; she works at a hotel, where most of her life revolves around. But when her grandmother dies, and as Lisa prepares to fly home taking the red eye, she meets Jackson (Cillian Murphy), a seemingly charming man whom she encounters not once, but twice before her plane boards only to find that she is seated in the seat next to Jackson's. Moments after takeoff, Jackson drops his act and reveals himself as a man who is involved in a plan to kill the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, and it's Lisa who must set the plan into action... or else her father will be murdered. And at 30,000 feet, there's no where to run and nowhere to get help.<br /><br />This is where Craven's film really takes flight (so to speak), becoming a gripping and edgy claustrophobic suspense thriller in the mould of Hitchcock, while making perceptive use of intruding close up shots to penetrate the audience deep within the heroine's estranged predicament. Told she must make an air phone call in order to move a political figure closer to death's door, or else her Father will be appropriately bumped off, Rachel frustrates in her attempts to play Rippner at his own game. Whilst on board there's a comical array of Airport type passengers who unintentionally complicate Rippner's decadent ploy: stand outs include a voluptuous middle aged women, who constantly seeks Rippner's assistance with her overhead luggage, a friendly but interfering old lady, (reminiscent of Helen Hayes in "Airport 1970") and a resourceful beady-eyed child on her first flight.  But its Cillian Murphy's slanderous turn as Rippner - his unusually chiseled features and watery blue eyes used at first to charm, then terrorize Rachel in a sadistic turn of malevolence - that dominates the screen with a cool and creeping exterior presence. McAdams also fairs well in the resourceful heroine role, forced to flex her action muscles once the ball slides into her court, while successfully anchoring the film into believability with her homely emanation.<br /><br />Once the pivotal flight sequence is over however Craven is on disappointingly familiar stalk and slash territory, as Rachel proceeds to run from a now vocally impaired Rippner, (metaphorically morphed into a monstrous persona -a sly nod to Craven's Freddy Kruger creation), with the film beginning to lose some of its momentum following a predictable array of genre cliques, which finds Rachel becoming trapped inside her family home armed with hockey stick, with the sinister Rippner lurking around somewhere in typical psycho killer defiance.  On the whole "Red Eye" remains an engrossing if routine thriller, which should banish memories of Craven's recent disastrous werewolf outing "Cursed", while keeping you buckled to your seat with high-octane tension.  Craven is obviously starting to get away from his teeny-bopping, "let's make the big bucks" thrillers ("Scream"," Cursed") and has decided to lean toward films that made him famous in the first place ("The Hills Have Eyes"," A Nightmare on Elm Street") with "Red Eye".  Although it lacks characterization and has some plot mishaps, it is a deadly serious thriller that doesn't have tongue-in-cheek humor or cater to pre-teen audiences-it's goal is to just flat out scare you with its shocking (used very loosely here) twists and intense reality and while it only moderately succeeds in these departments, at least it was an adequate effort back into the realm of serious thrills and chills.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>Red Eye might defy reality with ideas that border perilously on campy -- an airlines called Fresh Air for instance -- but it knows itself well enough to have its say in 90 minutes and move on.<br /><br />Our two protagonists face off in the claustrophobic confines of an airliner en-route to Miami. We manage to compress some gripping inflight suspense between a credible hitman sent to assassinate a government official and his family, and his grossly underestimated co-passenger and threat target, a young female executive of the swank Miami hotel where the official will be staying.<br /><br />I recommend not reading too much of the plot but this private little drama between hunter and prey plays out rather well as the plane careens towards Miami. Sadly, soon as we land, all the twisty onboard suspense culminates into a horribly pat wham-bam climax straight out of the screen writer's fantasy. The film is perhaps partially saved by a taut script, and some well delivered action.<br /><br />Decent rental if you are in the mood for a template psycho-political thriller. I enjoyed it for what it was worth, but this is one that cries out for suspension of disbelief.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>Although in many respects predictable, "Red Eye" is still quite capable of keeping the viewer on the edge of his or her seat.  Yes, good does triumph over evil at the end of the day - this is, after all, Hollywood - but only after the viewer is taken on a roller coaster ride of emotions.<br /><br />A brief synopsis of the film is that there is a complex plot to assassinate the director of Homeland Security while he is visiting Miami.  A key to achieving this end is that his hotel room must be changed from one that is deemed secure to one that the assassins believe they can breach.  To make the room change, the hotel is manager is threatened while returning from Texas to Miami.  She must arrange the change over the phone otherwise her father will be killed.<br /><br />Director, Wes Carven, whose background is in films of the horror genre, deftly adapts to a more mainstream production.  Indeed, it is Craven's cinematic skill that permits this film to soar above lesser films of the same genre.  Craven shows some skills of a Hitchcock nature particularly, yet subtly, the clever use of music to heighten moments of suspense.<br /><br />I recommend this film as top quality escapist drama.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Lisa Reisert (McAdams) is heading home to Miami to see her dad (Cox).  Of course, her leaving for home puts the hotel she works at in a bind.  She apparently is the one that kept everything moving smoothly.  When her fill-in calls her looking for some help, Lisa is able to diffuse the crisis over the phone.  Thank God for cell phones.  Then, while waiting for her delayed flight, she meets Jackson Rippner (Murphy).  They have a few drinks in the lounge, and then find themselves sitting next to each other on the plane.<br /><br />They have hit it off and things are going well for Lisa.  Then she finds out that Jackson is not what he seems, and his ulterior motives are going to make this an awful flight for her.  It seems that he has a task for her to perform, or her dad will pay the price.  Now, trapped on a plane with her dad's life in danger, Lisa must figure a way out of this crisis that could have far reaching consequences.<br /><br />"Red Eye" is a fast moving, edge of your seat thriller.  Director Wes Craven keeps ratcheting up the tension until the very end.  Murphy is perfect as the crazed Rippner, especially when all out craziness is required.  McAdams is believeable as the woman who is used to being in control of everything.  "Red Eye" is a good, fast-paced and entertaining thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>This movie does what it says it's going to do. It is a throat grabber, a movie where the unexpected happens. McAdams is convincing as a young woman in an important job who keeps her cool. We know that something is a little off with her because we see a scar on her chest. She's a customer service maven, a manager of the wealthy Miami Lux hotel, and she's afraid of flying.<br /><br />Murphy on the other hand is a good villain, fairly amoral, not interested in money or companionship, but willing to kill to get his target acquired and then resolved.<br /><br />The other roles are even handed and while they are certainly peripheral, we get a chance to see them interact with McAdams when times are smooth and later on when things become unglued.<br /><br />Kudos as always to Wes Craven who keeps us on the edge of our seats as he weaves the tale one by one closing the doors that lead to any escape of the heroine.<br /><br />It's not a slasher movie. It's just a good old fashioned scary mystery. It does seem to come apart and unravel a little at the ending. But it's not Tolstoy nor does it have any pretentions. Mr. Craven gives us a few hints along the way of what's going to happen: the aforementioned scar. The little girl who has her own will; the big teenagege nervous Nellie with the big pen; the pictute of Lisa (Rachel) and her College Field Hockey stick.<br /><br />I don't know what you guys wanted.

Rachel McAdams does good "smart girl in peril".<br /><br />As I watched this film, I was reminded of Hitchcock and "Dial M for Murder". I think the two films are very much alike in a couple of ways, not in all.<br /><br />First of all, McAdams is not a weak woman, whereas Grace Kelly's character was. However, both are women who are wooed by unscrupulous men and fall for it.<br /><br />Second, Cillian Murphy is a charming pretty boy who turns on a dime to become one heck of an evil guy. Ray Milland is a charming guy who turns out to be evil too.<br /><br />Finally, the movie does Hitchcock proud. It sets us up for the events to come by letting us believe that we are witnessing one thing, only to turn everything all around and mix it up.<br /><br />Wes Craven, the film's director, is NOT known for subtlety, which is why this film is all the more interesting. Craven actually takes his time developing his characters and delivers a sinister plotline with care and timing. His previous films have been horror and gorefest films that were as subtle as a sledge hammer.<br /><br />Craven does a darned good Hitchcock imitation. Murphy and McAdams deliver darned good performances.<br /><br />Personal note that has nothing to do with the review: McAdams and Murphy are not Kelly or Milland and Craven is not Hitchcock. Somehow, Milland and Kelly managed to provide a depth of character that this film's stars don't quite deliver. I don't know how to put my finger on it, and it's really not so much a criticism of this film as it is a yearning for the the actors of the 30's through the 50's. They just did it a bit better, in my opinion. Watching Dial M for Murder, you can just see the wheels turning in the people's heads as they think through what has gone before. Also there was just a higher degree of terror when Kelly is attacked. Was it Hitchcock's direction or the actors or was it both? I don't know how to discern that. Regardless, there is no one out there today that can do a real thriller like this very well. Craven has done a stand up job and I think this film warrants four stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ.html">A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ</a><br/><p>Terrified of flying, Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) reluctantly hops a red-eye flight bound for Miami and buckles up for a bumpy ride.

RED EYE is horror director Wes Craven's shot at a straight-out thriller, and he comes through just fine.

You get the feeling she's going to be one of those hysterical female types, intimidated by a terrorist. Rippner uses both mental and physical abuse during the flight back home, to get Lisa to switch hotel rooms of the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security (using her Management Power and Authority) so that his cohorts get a good target to hit. Brian Cox plays Lisa's Dad, who is the unsuspecting hostage that will be killed unless Lisa complies to Rippner's demands.<br /><br />Ah.. but, Lisa ends up kicking butt. She first performs an unscheduled "trachaeotomy" on Rippner with a pen (i.e. stabs him in the throat), and then escapes just as the plane lands. She then proceeds to steal an SUV from the "Departing Flights" drop-off area and uses it to smash into and send the would-be assassin of her Dad through the front doors of the house. And finally, as Rippner catches up to her at the house; takes him for a tour of the house (a la hide-and-seek) before she and daddy put a couple of holes in him.<br /><br />Jayma Mays plays Cynthia, Lisa's co-worker and front desk agent at the hotel. She lacks confidence, is not very well organized and space-out to a point of being annoying. But she, like Lisa is able to "keep cool" when the chips are down, and ends up being a life-saver in the end. She really turns out to be quite cute with her lines.

SURPRISINGLY GOOD MOVIE.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Red Eye (Wes Craven, 2005)<br /><br />Wes Craven released two movies in 2005; Cursed was the flop, and Red Eye was the hit. What I find interesting is that the two movies aren't that far off from one another: full of young-and-beautifuls doing their thing, while we, the audience, are invited to watch.<br /><br />The main difference between the two movies is that Red Eye does not, thankfully, have a Kevin Williamson-penned script; most of Craven's troubles started when he hooked up with Williamson, and since 1996, Craven's movies have, to a one, been better when Williamson is not writing them. Here, teleplay writer Carl Ellsworth adapts his own short story. The good news is, it's not Kevin Williamson. The bad news, which isn't so bad, is that Red Eye reads, as one might expect, like an episode of your basic TV thriller.<br /><br />In this episode, Lisa (Rachel McAdams, of Mean Girls fame) is returning home after a funeral, rushing to catch the red eye. Typical airport stuff. She runs into a stranger-- I don't want to say handsome stranger, though I'm sure some folks will find him such-- named Jackson (28 Days Later's Cillian Murphy, who looks far better with a beard) a couple of times, then finds out he's got the seat on the plane next to hers. While every trailer, ad, and copy has told you what Jackson's deal is, why should I?<br /><br />There's nothing here you won't see coming a mile away, and actually, you've seen a good deal of it before. Craven, in his prime, could have still turned such a derivative work into a blissfully stylish Craven masterpiece; here, while his touch is certainly felt, it still comes off rather like a particularly brilliant episode of Magnum, P. I. ***</p></br><a href="../users/A1N7YA81ZI4KAF.html">A1N7YA81ZI4KAF</a><br/><p>Wes Craven's contribution to the horror genre has been a lot of "hits" and "misses". Several of his films have become classics of the horror genre; "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and "Scream" are the two best examples of this while "The Hills Have Eyes" and "The Last House on the Left" have become cult classics but let's not forget some of his other failed attempts such as "Deadly Friend", "Shocker" and "The People Under the Stairs". "Red Eye" differs from most of Craven's previous work because it's not a horror film. It's a slick, well-crafted thriller that features a great cast, some genuinely intense scenes and  heart-pounding suspense. Craven can gladly add "Red Eye" to his "hit's" list.<br /><br />Rachel McAdams plays Lisa- a young busy body who works at a chic resort Hotel. After attending her Grandmothers funeral, Lisa takes the "Red Eye" flight back home to Miami. At the airport, she bumps into a charming stranger named Jackson who offers her a drink and good conversation. As luck would have it, she ends up sitting right next to him on the flight. As their conversation progresses, it is soon made clear that the nice stranger isn't nice at all and his true motivations are exposed. It appears there is an assassination plot to kill a security official and his family but in order for it to go as planned, Jackson must convince Lisa via threatening her father's life, to authorize a room change for the unsuspecting victim in order to position him as a target. She must do it using the airplane's unreliable telephone and 30 thousand feet up in the air. Lisa tries repeatedly to outsmart her fellow passenger and a game of cat and mouse ensues.<br /><br />Finding a film that last under 90 minutes nowadays is a rare occurrence and one of the reasons this film had me glued to the screen was due to its rather short running time. There never really was a dull moment. The film didn't give me chance to get bored, get popcorn or even blink and the performances from the two leads were impressive. McAdams commanded my attention even during the film's less intense situations and Cillian Murphy proved he can be a mighty good villain.<br /><br />Like Schumacher's "Phone Booth", "Red Eye" is a fast-paced, well-executed, well directed time-waster where normal people are suddenly thrown into a violent, diabolical world of murder and mayhem. With a running time of just under 90 minutes, it hardly gives you a chance to catch your breath.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XJOSJN6FHFO0.html">A1XJOSJN6FHFO0</a><br/><p>Lisa is certainly having a bad day.

How could the bad guys plan the plane delay and what if the Homeland Security person simply refuse to move?  Plus the darn missle nearly knocked out the whole floor.  Seems to me that it didn't need to be that exact room.  I liked the fact that heroine had a steel backbone and didn't need any rescuing.  It's also very scary how both parties were able to escape the airport after landing after she stabbed him in the neck.  9/11 hasn't changed much (which is probably closer to reality than I like think).<br /><br />Overall, I can't believe this elaborate plan to kill the Homeland Security director all hendged on a hotel manager--but whatever.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFNOZKR9WTYI.html">AIFNOZKR9WTYI</a><br/><p>Ok, I'm gonna be live-blogging this one.<br />7:29 PM I got my beer (Murphy's Irish Stout) and pizza (homemade, mushroom and pastrami toppings) and I'm upstairs watching the movie on my laptop...<br />7:31 Ok, there's lots of ominous music, though all that's happening is a guy has dropped his keys and wallet on a table and he's gone inno the bathroom to take a cr@p.

She seems interchangeable with any number of vacuous young women.<br />7:46  Ok, she's just met up with a young "man."  He is irritatingly smarmy from word "go."

Any young woman who thinks this guy has any substance deserves all she gets.<br />7:52 Ok, these people are all garbage.  Everyone in the movie is a piece of garbage.  Translation: the writer's a piece of garbage.  The "Deputy Director of Homeland Security" is on TV.  He's saying, "Don't get me wrong, I believe diplomacy can work, but first you have to have their attention."  I would imagine directing foreign policy is a little out of the purview of the Deputy Director of Homeland Security.  But I guess we're not supposed to notice.  We're supposed to furrow our brow and say to ourselves, "Political, eh?"  Then we're supposed to feel real sophisticated, ready for the next adult happening in the film.<br />8:05 Ok, the "plane" is taking off and what you see is a computer graphic of a plane instead of a real plane.  They spared no expense on this one.  Over and out.<br />8:52 Ok, post script: the problem with this movie is you don't care about any of the characters.  You don't care if the main character's dad gets killed.  You don't care if the Sub Regulator of Fatherland Purity gets killed.  You just don't care.  In fact, you want them all to die.<br />10:24 Ok, back watching this turkey.  Right now the secret service, which seems to be composed of guys in their mid twenties, is "clearing" the hotel room that the Deputy Inspector of Hometown Integrity and his used-up trophy wife and ridiculously angelic children are about to occupy.  The lead agent, maybe twenty six years old, says, "Clear the room" and next you see a guy in a suit waving a little metal box with knobs and lights on it over a glass vase.  Its unclear what this device is supposed to be detecting... if the room is bugged?  If the vase is made of C4?  You're just supposed to be uncritically letting all this wash over you as you noisily slurp from your giant soda and think about pretending to stretch and then letting your arm fall on the shoulder of your date.  You're not supposed to be wondering how exactly this activity you are witnessing constitutes "clearing the room." THEN one of the other agents looks from the penthouse balcony over the ocean through binoculars and sees a lone yacht about a mile away.  He calls this to the attention of the lead agent who says, "Call it in."  I see.  So the vicinity of the hotel is now restricted air land and sea space?  Like if there's a fat guy about to go off the diving board... "Call him in."  I'm REALLY rooting for the assassins at this point.<br />11:06 Ok, done.  Very depressed.  Movie absolutely ludicrous.  Night shot to hell.  IT seems as though the film-makers are counting on the viewer hoping Dad doesn't get killed and the Vice Secretary of Homeland Infiltration doesn't get assassinated because.... we cherish human life?  It is taken for granted that we think the dude is right as rain, and ditto for dear old dad who seems to do nothing other than sleep in his chair.<br />1:00 PM, next day: Lemme see if I got this right: the fiendishly clever plan is as follows: waylay a girl who works behind the desk in a hotel, threaten her with her father being killed if she doesn't move the target to a different room, then some guys in a boat retrieve a bazooka from the ocean floor with a fishing pole and blow the room sky high, all for the purpose of offing this "politico"?  This plan really stinks.  Ever hear of the KISS principle?  All you need is one guy with a sniper rifle.  He puts a bullet through this A-hole's head and... pack your bags fellas, war's over.  What's that you say?  These "secret service" guys are muy professional and they'll totally detect los sniper?  That's nonsense.  Just think of the number of locations our man could be in, the hundreds of office buildings, etc etc.  Besides, if that's not dramatic enough for the Hollywood fast set who know so much about warfare, why don't our assassins just show up in a helicopter armed with miniguns and process the dude to the tune of 4,000 7.62mm rounds a minute?  That's good viewing.  I'd pay double admission just to watch 10 minutes of slo-mo of the dude getting hosed down.  In fact, I will personally volunteer to direct the mission to kill this fictional character.  Just give me a minigun-equipped little bird and I will be inbound hot.  To paraphrase Tennyson, The dude will be at the quiet limit of the world... and the joyless end of the minigun.  Or how bout they just take out the motorcade with some LARS rockets?  What's that you say?  The motorcade is composed of "armored Escalades??!?"  Ohhh, I'm scared.  You think the screenwriter would like to take a direct bazooka hit while sitting in an "armored Escalade"?</p></br><a href="../users/A100JCBNALJFAW.html">A100JCBNALJFAW</a><br/><p>not once did i think to my self something bad could happen to this girls dad maybe she didint play the part that good or maybe the plot sucked or both. but this movie feels like a rip off of air force one in a sence. if you wanna watch a movie about hostages watch the movie HOSTAGE and if you want to watch a good movie by WES CRAVEN watch a nightmare on elm street</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>"Red Eye" is a throw back to the days of Hitchcock, when movies were more of a mind trip and what would I do in that situation. That is the case here in this film. As I watched this movie, I thought about what I would do if this happened to me. Wes Craven, even though I love his other movies, has proven that he can do other things besides slashers and be amaazing.<br /><br />The acting in the film was really well done and I wasn't disappointed at all with who I was watching this movie for, Cillian Murphey. He is one of the most talented recent actors to emerge. No matter how many times I see him in a movie, he always amazes me. As in Batman Begins, he makes an excellent villain. Rachel did an equally amazing job in the movie. Like I said, I tried to figure out what I would do in her place and it shows the acting talents of both the heroine and the villain.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a fan of thrillers and movies that put you in that situation, this movie is for you. I highly recommend this film to both fans of thrillers and the actors/actresses who are in this movie. I don't think it needs a sequel, but I could see one being done.</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>The only reason, and I do mean the 'only' reason to watch this ridiculous film, is the standout performance given by Rachel McAdams.  She shows some incredible range of emotion from helplessness to defiance and I was immediately enamored with her talent as well as her beauty.  Director Wes Craven, know primarily for his groundbreaking work in the horror film genre, takes a day off to try his hand at suspense, Hitchcock-style.  The pace of the film is speedy and sometimes distracted me from the fact I didn't care what was going on, but in retrospect this turns into an incredibly dumb movie.  Nobody here could save a script that starts off promising but eventually veers off onto the shoulder then crashes into a large oak tree.  The plotting goes down far too familiar roads, and I often felt bad for Rachel McAdams trapped inside this predictable story.  She is the saving grace that keeps me from throttling this film down to a 1-star rating.  The more characters that become involved in the plot, the more convoluted the plot becomes.  Early on in the story there are just two characters in an intense situation that may or may not be true.  Perhaps there is a hidden agenda?  The beginning is ripe with possibilities.  But as all is eventually revealed the whole mess becomes just plain ripe.  This movie stinks.  With any other actress in the lead role I am certain I would not have even bothered to finish watching the film at all.  However, keep an eye out for Rachel McAdams.  She is a starlet on the rise.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>Wes Craven's thriller "RedEye" takes about 20 minutes to get rolling, then spends the rest of its brief running time -- only 1 hour and 19 minutes -- in a high octane murder plot and chase that hardly spares you a second to breathe or run to the bathroom without missing something important.<br /><br />And it does this mostly on board an airplane in scenes that pull off one of the great ironic puns in cinema history. This because the airline the heorine and bad guy are flying on is called Fresh Air.<br /><br />Some nice scenes at L.A. International Airport and in Miami add realism to the storyline, which is pretty familiar but carried out very well by the actors. Craven's direction and strong film editing also star in this little movie, which delivers quite a wallop in a short stay.<br /><br />The story concerns a young heroine (Rachel McAdams) and a really good looking bad guy (Cillian Murphy) who play tug of war on an airliner as the bad guy tries to help off a government official. Our heroine tries not to be extorted and to save her dad at the same time. The bad guy has an associate ready to delete her father if she doesn't cooperate.<br /><br />The story becomes pretty predictable but still continues to surprise as it goes along. Scenes from the very beginning of the movie, cast under the weight of opening credits, come back during a fishing trip that really help deliver some action.<br /><br />This didn't win any awards and none of the actors are big stars, but don't let that stop you from spending the better part of an hour and a half with this DVD if you enjoy mystery, action or engaging filmmaking. It's a small movie but also a good one, clearly above average regardless of its budget or star appeal.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"Red Eye" is a movie that puts most of its cards on the table.  At the start we see a wallet with a pair of initials on it being stolen.  We also see a large metal container being smuggled into the United States.  Two points determine the pathof a line and we know that these two events are connected.  Actually if you assume that everything you see and hear in this 2005 thriller has something to do with what is going on.  If Carl Ellsworth (who wrote the "Halloween" episode of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer") has somebody on the airplane suddenly talk about a missing pen, then that would be a CLUE, and attention must be paid.  That does not mean that director Wes Craven ("Scream/2/3") will not play with your expectations in an effort to keep things honest, but for the most part you can see how everything is set up and red herrings are pretty nonexistent.  The result is more a question of anticipation than predictability and it was not until the big finish that I actually got to the point where I was saying (out loud in fact) that this could not be the "end" because "X" had not happened yet, which is pretty good for a thriller.<br /><br />The genesis for this film was apparently the simple idea of what happens if you get on an airplane and end up being seated next to the passenger from Hell.  At this point many of you will be thinking back to "Planes, Trains & Automobiles," but this film is something quite different because it takes place in a world where apparently nothing is coincidence.  Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) is a hotel desk manager for a swank hotel in Miami, who is heading home from Dallas after attending her grandmother's funeral.  Her flight is delayed and she has occasion to meet Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy) more than once before she gets on the flight and discovers they are seatmates.  He wants to know if she is stalking him and what proves to be a deadly game begins in earnest.<br /><br />I have to admit that when I watched this DVD I had managed to forget anything I might have heard or read about "Red Eye."  Obviously Lisa is the heroine and Jackson is the villain (after this and "Batman Begins," Murphy is going to have to make an earnest effort to avoid being typecast in such roles).  But since all the dots connect in this film it has to have something to do with Charles Keefe (Jack Scalia), the new head of Homeland Security who said some rather stupid things on television for someone whose position has to do with defense and not offense when it comes to terrorists.  Before she gets on the plane Lisa is juggling cell phone calls from her father (Brian Cox) and her nervous assistant, Cynthia (Jayma Mays), and the film puts more of its cards in position on the table.  But there is a hole card, which is revealed when Lisa has to change her blouse (talk about bait and switch).<br /><br />The best thing this film has going for it is Rachel McAdams.  In case you did not notice, 2005 was a very good year for the actress.  After being the blonde Queen Bee in "Mean Girls" back in 2004, she went back to dark hair and did "The Notebook."  Then in 2005 she made "Red Eye" in between "Wedding Crashers" and "The Family Stone."  She may well be the best thing in all three of those films, but this is the one where she has to do the most heavy lifting.  Her character is smart, which only makes her more attractive as far as I am concerned, and despite her vulnerability we do not believe that she will be a victim.  There are some moments where both the heroine and the villain are conveniently stupid (when you get somebody down, go all in and finish them off: everybody in my family knows this), but there are enough smart moments and we are rooting for Lisa, so such slights can be easily forgiven.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>Director Wes Craven, the unanimous `master of ceremonies' for many within the horror genre, started his filmmaking career back in 1971 with the drama Together, dubbed in German and a rare find in the current film market. This is not the sort of hollowed beginning one would expect from the man who would go on to be credited for creating one of the most terrifying movie monsters of all time, Freddy Krueger, and for revitalizing the horror genre itself with his now venerable Scream franchise. Critically and publicly acclaimed work in The Hills Have Eyes, Swamp Thing, and The Nightmare on Elm Street are the types of films which have made him infamous throughout Hollywood. However, for reasons which may never be explained - perhaps out of personal interest, who knows, he has chosen to shift his directing skills away from the slasher flicks which have made him essentially a household name and more toward ordinary dramas. But this is Wes Craven after all. Is anything he has done ever ordinary, let alone normal?<br /><br />The story for Red Eye is easily discernible, nothing startling enigmatic about it, but director Wes Craven, infamous for breaking with the conventional, takes the concept of aeronautical hostage taking to a whole sinister new level. At first glance the premise is not that entirely incalculable - terrorist henchman takes woman hostage and threatens to kill a loved one unless she cooperates in helping him commit an assassination of a US governmental official, she escapes, and he gives chase. Clear enough, right? As the film progresses, however, it intricately evolves into an impertinent, sophisticated thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. What Steven Spielberg did for sharks and the beach with Jaws Wes Craven and Red Eye will do for airplanes, hands down. There are undoubtedly fears that this film will inadvertently cause people to conjure up harrowing memories of the September 11th hijackings but rest assured that the premise deals secularly with one woman and not the idea of using an airliner for the purposes of committing an act of terrorism. Nonetheless, the concept of a hostage being taken, to the awareness of everyone else on board or not, remains apprehensible. It is far more foreseeable that an individual who has been the victim of a carjacking will be shaken by Red Eye, in which case it would be advisable that such individuals be prepared when viewing this film.<br /><br />Rachael McAdams is a far cry from what one would characterize as a damsel in distress. Beyond the distinguishable observations that she is indeed a woman trapped within a horrendous situation, essentially caught between a rock and a hard place to be quite frank, McAdam's character breaks with the conventions of a typical Hollywood heroine at around the half-way point in the picture. For the first half of the film it would appear as though she has done everything within her power to draw attention to herself while on the plane so as to be rescued from the clutches of Jackson. Proprietary thinking on the theatrical feminine clich&eacute; would lead you to assume that she would simply give up, but instead she takes action and fights back. This clear cut break from the conventional role of women in thrillers is a welcome change, although this has been evident in Hollywood for at least the past decade. Not that the `damsel in distress' clich&eacute; is not without its charms; it is just a relief to see a change in pace for once.<br /><br />Cillian Murphy, known earlier this summer by audiences for his supporting villain role in Christopher Nolan's smash hit, Batman Begins, evidently has a knack for playing intimidating and deranged individuals onscreen. Murphy's quite demeanor and absorbing personality just within the first few scenes audiences encounter with him make his character trusting and endearing to us. As the atmosphere shifts slowly toward that of the dark side, Jackson puts all his cards on the table and the transformation all the more shocking to us, though to be quite honest this should not have come as a surprise in the least. This is truly a credit to Murphy's brilliantly stark performance. The single tragic flaw evident in his character however is at time, specifically near the end of the movie, he comes off as though he is the `Energizer Bunny' of crazed assassins. Rachael McAdams stabs him in the throat with a pen, which he proceeds in due time to pull out of his throat and simply ties a scarf around the wound, has numerous thrown at him, falls down a flight of stairs, is stabbed with a high-heel shoe, and yet he keeps on coming. After awhile it gets a little tiresome. Luckily daddy steps in and puts a few bullets in him to end his little tirade.<br /><br />Overall, underneath Red Eye's intelligible and rather conspicuous exterior boils a penetrating, emotional suspense drama that will keep audiences on the edge of their seats till the very end. There is quite a bit to enjoy about Wes Craven's intricate psychological thriller, yet adversely there are certain aspects within the context of the film that help bring the quality of the picture down a notch or two. There is this continuous discussion of terrorists and assassinations and yet there remains so little known about the main motivating force behind all of this. Who are these terrorists? What reason do they have to assassinate the director of Homeland Security other then to show off to the world that they can knock a governmental official who can just as easily be replaced? Presumptively these components were left unanswered by Craven in order to maintain the complexity of the script but they remain nagging questions that deserve at least an explanation. And the other negative connotation this film possesses is the build up of clich&eacute;s which reaches a breaking point in the storyline just as the picture is in the final stretch to its conclusion. The inclusion of the `low-battery signal on the cell phone just when the hero has evaded her pursuer' trick will likely be the most noticeable and irritating clich&eacute; for audiences to swallow, but given that this is Wes Craven we are talking about here it should not honestly come as too much of a surprise. With that said though, Red Eye remains a smart, sophisticated thriller on such a level which has not been seen by movie audiences since the bygone days of Alfred Hitchcock. As limited a storyline and as confined as its environmental space is, Red Eye surpasses in intensity within the course of a mere few minutes what it takes a big-budget, marquee star picture an entire hour to do.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>**1/2<br /><br />"Red Eye" is a so-so friendly-skies thriller that starts off fairly well but becomes increasingly less plausible as it rolls along.<br /><br />Rachel McAdams is a hotel manager, deathly afraid of flying, who is returning to Miami after the funeral of her grandmother.  Sitting in the seat next to her is a seemingly pleasant young man (played by Cillian Murphy) who turns out to be part of a plot to assassinate the director of the Department of Homeland Security who is staying in McAdams' hotel.  The plan is to get her to switch the director's room so that the killers can get a better shot at him and his family.  As a way of securing her help, the assassins are threatening to kill her father if she doesn't cooperate.<br /><br />Although this is little more than a standard-issue potboiler, the scenes in the plane are reasonably effective at creating a modicum of suspense and believability, given the claustrophobic nature of the setting.  But once the jet lands and McAdams and Murphy start chasing each other through the airport and, eventually, all over greater Miami, credibility flies out the window and we're left with a silly little thriller that spins completely out of control and that provokes laughter from us in all the wrong places.<br /><br />Like the plot itself, the film stays airborne for awhile, then crash lands.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>Here is the situation.

I don't know either.<br /><br />It was pretty slow.  I think they made it as exciting as they could for being on an airplane.  I mean, you can't have too much excitement on an airplane without arrousing too much attention and ruining everything.  But with what little they had to work with, I'll give Wes Craven a few thumbs up for the tension that he is able to create.<br /><br />The tension builds up to an intense ending that actually raised my pulse rate a bit.  In other words, the only thing worth catching in this movie is the last 10 minutes of it.  I even think it helped bump it up to 2 stars!<br /><br />If I could once again choose what to do this last two hours, it wouldn't be watching this movie.  I'd recommend avoiding this movie unless you really have nothing else to do.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ.html">A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ</a><br/><p>The first half of RED EYE is fairly suspensful and absorbing mostly due to the excellent evil-doer acting of Cillian Murphy, who "kidnaps" our heroine, played by Rachel McAdams, on a red eye flight in order to assassinate a Home Security bigwig. Thriller movies like this rise or fall depending on the quality of the actor playing the villian (and the script backing him or her up). Reference is made to DIE HARD as an example where a strong and interesting villain character made the film. And for the first part of RED EYE we have a suave, clever, smooth, manipulative, dangerous bad guy in Mr. Murphy. Then, suddenly, all that falls apart. Murphy's character becomes a pathetic victim of the super woman heroine. But we won't give away any more plot information. The point is, it went from scary believeable to laugh-out-loud unbelieveable. Wes Cravens, the horror film vet, directed this non-horror effort. Perhaps he should stick to the horror genre in future.</p></br><a href="../users/A29COAL60SB48B.html">A29COAL60SB48B</a><br/><p>Wes Craven did a pretty good job with the suspense movie (as opposed to what he's known best for - horror).  At just about an hour and a half, Red Eye is an enjoyable view, the plot is clear, the action flows swiftly, and the ending tied up the plot quite nicely, bringing about a satisfying conclusion.  (Now, if only Hollywood would take notice and trim the two-and-a-half hour snooze-fests that stretch the storyline beyond reasonable limits...)<br /><br />It was great to see people exactly my age who are able to get the viewer to suspend belief for the duration of the movie and take you into the world of their character.  Cillian Murphy was the perfect villain and Rachael Mc Adams the perfect victim.  Murphy played his part so well that you wanted to scream because he had all his bases covered before he stepped on that plane.  And it was nice to see Lisa (Mc Adams) play by Jack's rules and get the best of him in the end.<br /><br />Red Eye is a new film that I actually enjoyed.

Red Eye is much better then Cursed and is a Craven diversion from his usual gore scare fest. Rachel McAdams (Wedding Crashers, Mean Girls) plays Lisa who is taking the Red Eye back home because she just had her Grandma's funeral. She is going back to where she works which is a Hotel in Miami and also to her Father, played by the great Brian Cox (X2: X-Men United, Troy). In the airport she meets Jack Riptner, played with sinister ease by the awesome Cillian Murphy (Intermission, 28 Days Later). McAdams and Murphy hit it off sharing things with one another and having drinks. She then winds up ironically sitting right next to him on the plane. But it's not a coincedence because he is there for a purpose and that purpose is for McAdams to do somethings for him otherwise her Father dies. Murphy wants McAdams to have her Hotel switch rooms for a rich man and his family because he is going to be killed. So, McAdams tries everything to stall him and escape but he sees right threw her. Eventually, when the plane lands she escapes and he follows her to try to stop her. The two leads give good performances, especially Murphy who is playing yet another bad guy this summer alongside the hit Batman Begins where he played The Scarecrow. The end showdown scene in the house kinda felt a little bit Scream-ish. Also starring Colby Donaldson...and if you dont know who is he, he played one of the rich guy's secret service suits and he was also in the second season of Survivor...dont ask me how I know this...I just do.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>If you haven't seen Cillian Murphy in action I recommend that you rent '28 days Later' or go see 'Red Eye' immediatly.  This is one of Hollywoods rising stars and he does no better than he's done in 'Red Eye'.  Next to young rising star Rachel McAdams, he holds his own and stands his ground as the REAL star of this picture.  At the outset of the picture you meet Lisa, a young manager of the LUX hotel in Miami.  She is flying back from a funeral in Dallas when her plane is delayed forcing her to meet the charming Jackson (never Jack) Rippner.  He wines her before their flight and upon entering the plane they realize they are seated next to each other.  The trailer I though did a great job of deception because your forced to think that your about to see a romance comedy type movie and then your tossed into a thriller of all thrillers.  You see, Jackson is using Lisa to carry out his sceme of assasination and unless Lisa plays along her father is going to be murdered.  It's edge-of-your-seat the entire film, frame by frame and Cillian is the reason for the movies intesity.  He captures his charactors fierceness and forces the viewer to hate him.  I think I see the next Russell Crowe here...embodying his charactor and I'm sure will soon warrant the academys attention.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>"Red Eye" was a pleasant surprise for me.  With Wes Craven's reputation as a horror genre director with the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series and then the "Scream" films, I thought this would be a stalker flick, but the previews looked interesting.  Craven has proven he can change pace as with Meryl Streep in "The Music of the Heart" and "Red Eye" is a taut suspense drama.  I loved the compression of having most of the film set in the tight confines of an airplane.<br /><br />Rachel McAdams is certainly one of Hollywood's new bright lights.  The daughter of a Canadian truck driver, she's come a long way from "The Hot Chick" & "Mean Girls" to Ryan Gosling's love interest in "The Notebook" & Owen Wilson's love interest in "The Wedding Crashers."  As hotel administrator Lisa Reisert, McAdams demonstrates both professional confidence and personal vulnerability as she worries about her father.<br /><br />As Jackson Rippner, a Jack the Ripper pun, Irish actor Cillian Murphy is entrancing.  At first convincing as a flirtatious stranger, we soon see him metamorphize into a dangerous and committed terrorist.  With his appearances in "Batman Begins" as the creepy villain Dr. Jonathan Crane and as the peasant boy who loves "The Girl With the Pearl Earring," he's shown the range as an actor that was glimpsed in "28 Days."  In short, he's the kind of guy you love to hate.<br /><br />Brian Cox who was so wonderfully seedy in "The Bourne Identity" & "The Bourne Supremacy" and also played in "The Ring" & "Troy" does a good although not very demanding part of the father who for most of the movie sits in a recliner watching TV.  Then when the action hits at the end, he gets knocked out and lies unconscious.  He looks like a daddy!<br /><br />A couple of other wonderful cameos are also part of this film.  As the hotel clerk filling in while Lisa Reisert attends her grandmother's funeral, Jayma Mays plays Cynthia.  She does a wonderful job of looking confused, trying to do the right thing even when she doesn't quite know what to say or which computer button to push, and then saving the day by getting the Homeland Security secretary out of his room at the Lux Atlantic before the big blow.  It's the kind of break a young actress dreams of & Craven has been very generous in her screen time.<br /><br />Another lovely cameo is Angela Paton who plays the Nice Lady who gets a book from Lisa, only to have Lisa write a message in it & Jackson to steal it back.  Paton is one of those actresses you know you've seen, first appearing in "Dirty Harry" in 1971 & having played in Flatliners (1990), "Groundhog Day" (1993) & as Grandma in "American Wedding" (2003).  She doesn't have a major part, but she fills her screen time with depth.<br /><br />I found the tension in the film to unwind at just the right intervals.  The hotel explosion did look a bit fake (computer generated), but the mix of humor and tension work well in this charmer.  It is not an ambitious plot, but what it does is done extremely well.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>Rachel McAdams plays a hotel manager returning from her grandmother's funeral and trying to get on a flight among massive congestion.

I thought it was a supernatural thriller of some sort.  I was actually intrigued when the plot started unfolding, I was thinking wow what an original concept.  I will admit the story was original and fresh, the acting was fantastic.  I think Cillian Murpghy is one of a kind.  His look is so unusual and androgenous, he is hot isn't he?  Once the plane landed and she stuck him with the pen, the movie started to take another direction of textbook run and chase, good guy vs. bad guy.  You could pretty much write the ending yourself.  Heroin saves the day and everyone goes home happy.  I would have liked one more twist in the plot at the end, to give the movie and edge over your standard thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A1O60Q7LBN4MQ.html">A1O60Q7LBN4MQ</a><br/><p>Because of her job, a woman is being forced to make a call to set up an assassination against her will on a plane. The best part of this movie is when they land. Then it becomes very tense! To me, it seemed more like a very well done made-for-TV movie than a theatrical release. I do recommend this but you may want to wait until it comes on TV.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>I do not expect all thrillers to be works of pure genius, but I do expect most of them to be smarter than "Red Eye," a marvel of idiotic set-ups, asinine plot turns, and ridiculous pay-offs. This is a screenplay so unbelievably bad that not even two very fine young actors and a director known for his knack for suspense can salvage it.<br /><br />The premise: hot young hotel employee Lisa (Rachel McAdams) is returning home to Miami after her grandmother's funeral. Trapped in the web of airline travel, she befriends hunky, mysterious Jackson Ripper (Cillian Murphy) and finds him charming, unaware that a name like "Jackson Ripper" is about as subtle as a brick to the skull. (Why not just get it over with and name him Evil McSneakyton? Stabby O'Kidnapper? Willie Killus?)<br /><br />Anyway. The idea of having a thriller disguised in the first act as a quaint romance of sorts would be clever, except: a) the trailer (which, by the way, somehow contains more thrills in its two minutes than the feature does in ninety) already gave away the surprise, and b) the film is populated with so many outlandishly hackneyed side characters that it's impossible to focus on the main event. Why, there's the little old lady who's not very bright but is so nice to Lisa! Hey, there's the eleven-year-old girl who's flying all by herself for the very first time! Look, it's the cranky rich guy who complains about everything! All we're missing here is a singing nun, or at least a jive-talking Barbara Billingsley.<br /><br />Anyway again. It turns out that Bad Guy Q. Villainy is part of an elaborate plot to assassinate a top government official. The movie begs us to accept the idea that this entire plan revolves around a hotel desk manager, who must phone work and order them to movie said top government official to a new, unchecked-by-security-or-Secret-Service room for no real reason, and if she doesn't, some guy will kill her dad. Oh, and Dastardly J. Scoundrel is required to force her to do this while sitting in the busiest section of the airplane, with a good twenty people in earshot. You'd think he'd at least bother to whisper.<br /><br />Now, of course none of this is supposed to matter. We're supposed to be so caught up in the danger of it all - how will Lisa outwit her stalker? - that we're not supposed to quibble over the finer points. But these finer points are so sloppily handled that it makes no matter how well McAdams and Murphy come across. (For the record, they do the best they can with the ridiculous material, and watching them not drown in all the stupidity showcases their talent. It's a thankless film, the stupid action thriller that they do in between better projects, just to keep their stars rising. In a few years, they'll both be superstars, and nobody will bother remembering this lame early effort.)<br /><br />As for director Wes Craven, well, he sleepwalks through this one enough to provide a serviceable effort, but he never overcomes the script's faults. In fact, at times, Craven seems to revel in the stupidity. He does well enough in the film's middle section - the part in which Lisa and Gary Hitler square off on the plane - and while these moments are pretty stupid, at least the movie's not falling completely apart. Then we move into the third act, where they get off the plane, the action ramps up, and we have a big, dopey guy reacting to the sight of a missile flying right at him (funniest part of the movie, by the way), or we have the Grumbling, Self-Absorbed Hotel Guests finally getting their comeuppance, or we have forty other things happening that suggest the story should've stayed on the plane through the whole film. (The Johnny Evil-stalks-Lisa-through-dad's-house bit is quite the yawnfest.) Craven can't keep up with everything the script tosses his way, and he eventually gives in, figuring people that like big explosions will have a good time anyway, so why bother trying to make it good?<br /><br />Maybe I wouldn't be so hard on "Red Eye" had I not already seen "Flightplan," another stuck-on-a-plane thriller with more than its fair share of questionable logic. That film got right what "Red Eye" got wrong: its thrills are tight and effective, its characters interesting, its situations increasingly involving. "Red Eye," on the other hand, relies too heavily on undercooked ideas and laughable developments. It might have talented leads and a capable director, but with a screenplay as rickety as this, even the best would fall straight through.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>What would happen if you met a stranger in the airport on the way to catch a plane, then it turned out that the stranger's seat was right next to yours on the flight, then it turned out that it was no coincidence that the stranger's seat was next to yours, but part of a carefully engineered malevolent plan? Well to find out how it all turns out you need only to pick up this fast moving, thoroughly entertaining film.<br /><br />Cillian Murphy was as creepy in this as he was in Batman Begins (Scarecrow)...I'm not dissing him; it's a compliment to his acting and his eerie, piercing, convincing, cold blue eyes. He plays Jackson (Don't call me Jack!) Rippner along side Rachel McAdams (Lisa Reisert), and the both of them, especially their dialogue together, keep this movie moving along at a nice, real time pace.<br /><br />Post 9-11, some of the situations on the plane are (hopefully!) pretty unrealistic. Overall it's an enjoyable rental. Not a blockbuster movie that will land any of the cast or the Nightmare on Elm Street director on the Red Carpet. Only someone fresh off the Red Eye not thinking clearly would purchase instead of renting this.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>In 'Red Eye', we have Cillian Murphy starring as a Seemingly-Nice-Ne'er-Do-Well, alongside newbie Rachel McAdams' surprisingly fluid portrayal of an anally retentive hotel manageress, whose devotion to her job and her father make her the ideal scapegoat for a team of assassins intent on ending the life of the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security. With Wes Craven taking the directorial helm, one could be forgiven for writing this off as an obvious and unrewarding cash-in on the new paranoia surrounding airline travel - but, surprisingly enough, Craven, alongside the excellent pairing of Murphy and McAdam, has managed to craft a tight, tense and wholly captivating thriller out of what could so easily have been 'Flight Plan's poor cousin.<br /><br />Cillian Murphy is just like Johnathan Rhys-Myers; he's Irish, he's beautiful, he's great at accents, and he's able to turn on a dime from hero to villain. There's one major difference between Murphy and Rhys-Myers, though: Murphy has talent, he can act. He makes for a compelling villain here - the script offers no explanation for the actions of his would-be terrorist character Jackson Rippner, but Murphy's superior characterisation skills make for an enigmatic and menacing sort of villain. McAdams as the hapless-yet-plucky heroine Lisa Reisert is excellent - for a new star, she certainly displays a wealth of talent that belies her relatively scant experience. Sympathetic, energetic and totally watchable, I'm very interested to see just how the next few years of her career turn out - if this movie is anything to go by, she, like Murphy, seems to be headed for great things.<br /><br />Wes Craven is something of a revelation behind the camera here - personally, I haven't seen him do anything really original or standout since 1996's 'Scream' - but his fast pacing and skillful management of the action scenes make 'Red Eye' a definite success. There's a real sense of claustrophobia in the on-board turbulence and take-off sequences, and the penultimate scenes at the hotel and at Reisert's home are totally compelling. Not in the same league as "Fatal Attraction", perhaps, but top-notch stuff nonetheless.<br /><br />All in all, 'Red Eye' is a great movie, and does what any good action thriller ought to do: it's fun, fast and riveting, and is a very definite recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/AK1OBVI54SY73.html">AK1OBVI54SY73</a><br/><p>When I first watched Red Eye I thought it was just all right, mainly because I wasn't paying too much attention to it throughout. But I liked it enough to buy it and when I did again watch it one night I was blown away by how much more entertaining it was than I gave credit for.<br /><br />Almost right away the movie dives into the plot. Cillian Murphy's character cuts right to the chase about what he wants McAdam's character to do and from then it turns into a fast- paced and satisfying thrill of a ride that doesn't end till the credits.<br /><br />Cillian is just an amazing actor and was perfect for his role and McAdams was great with him. Their dialogue together throughout the films keeps you interested and the ending, although predictable, is also satisfying. The entire movie is short but rather exciting, with two talented actors that fit their roles like a glove, and the plot itself carries well.<br /><br />Overall highly recommended. One of my favorites to watch. 5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>The actors are the reason to see this one. Murphy, in this and Batman, makes his presence known and becomes a reason to go see his other work. Don't you wish the dead guy could stay that way?</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>RED EYE serves as sort of a primer on the rising stars of Rachel McAdams (who plays Lisa, the heroine) and Cillian Murphy (the notorious Jack Ripner).  McAdams who has appeared in such varying roles in THE HOT CHICK, THE NOTEBOOK, THE WEDDING CRASHERS and MEAN GIRLS is a very competent young actress.  She milks the role of the damsel in distress to perfection, evoking a sense of terror, determination and guilt.  Murphy who has appeared in COLD MOUNTAIN, 28 DAYS LATER, BATMAN BEGINS and BREAKFAST AT PLUTO's plays the sinister and outright evil villain with a twinkle in those darling blue eyes.  Smoothly moving from the nice guy at the airport into the cold blooded killer seems second nature to Murphy and he's scary!<br /><br />The movie's plot is rather far-fetched but in this kind of movie, one just sits back and lets the talented director Wes Craven take them on a pretty suspenseful ride.  Fans of SURVIVOR might recognize studly Colby Donaldson as the Defense Secretary's head bodyguard and Jack Scalia is the target of the assassination.  Brian Cox, usually a dynammic presence in any film, doesn't put much into his role as Lisa's father; would have liked to seen a little more passion on his part.  Overall, RED EYE is a competent suspenseful movie, though.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>All of the actors are amazing and the action is realistic and fun. The F/X were great. It steadily built suspense. I was on the edge of my seat most of the time.<br /><br />Hollywood has forgotten that people go to the movies to have a good time but Hitchchock understands.<br /><br />Cillian Murphy is creepier than he was in "Batman Begins".</p></br></body></html>

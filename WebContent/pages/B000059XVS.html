A visual feast in every respect, the film brings out all of the drama and tension that pervaded T.E. Lawrence's<br />spectacular yet turbulent life.<br /><br />The film starts at the end of WWI in England with Lawrence's(Peter O'Toole) death in a freak motorcycle accident. After his funeral, various acquaintances give conflicting opinions as to what they thought of the man and his achievements; the film then goes back to Lawrence's obscure origins as a low-ranked officer in Cairo during World War I.  Relieved of his boredom as a map maker/surveyor for military intelligence, Lawrence is sent across the Suez Canal to Arabia to establish contact with Bedouin tribes who might serve as guerillas against the Ottoman Turks.  At first unfamiliar with Arab culture and encountering a somewhat hostile reception, Lawrwence earns the trust of King Faisel (Alec Guiness) and his protege (Omar Shariff).  After a series of successful guerilla operations with the help of another sheik (Antony Quinn) and his followers against the Turks, Lawrence becomes a legendary icon for the Arabs as he seeks to unite their disparate tribes into a single nation.<br /><br />This is truly another example of Hollywood at its very best.  The sweeping cinematography of the desert, in addition to being a visual feast, provides a strong thematic backdrop for the Arab culture at that time.  In 1914-1918, Arabs (meaning specifically peoples from the Arabian peninsula) were mostly semi-nomadic peoples grouped in clans or tribes with vast territories centered around vital water wells that were more valuable than life itself.  The film accurately shows that only Westerners thought of Arabs as 'Arabs.'  Paraphrasing the character of Antony Quinn's response when Lawrence proposes that all 'Arabs' should be united: 'I know of Hawitat and Hashemites, but Arabs?  I know no such tribe.' The film of course is primarily focused on Lawrence's character; the forces which made him a hero; the bonds he formed; and, how those events changed his life to make him a legend in his own time.  All of this is done by first class acting and the impeccable direction of David Lean.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is one of the greatest films ever made in which its images speak for themselves.  This is all enhanced by the performance of first-rate actors under the guidance of a talented director.  All of this accompanied by the legendary score of Maurice Jarre (Dr. Zhivago, Frantic, and countless other great films.)  Get only the superbit version as the others don't do justice to the cinematography.  This is a film for everyone's collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COQ2DOO1O9HD.html">A1COQ2DOO1O9HD</a><br/><p>I had the great honor of seeing the restored Lawrence of Arabia in a pristine 70mm print in the late 80's. It was an experience I'll never forget.  There are movies half its length that seem twice as long.  <p>Part of the joy of watching this film is the knowledge that almost everything you see on the screen was REALLY THERE.  The film's most exciting sequence, the takng of Akaba, was staged full-scale on a riverbed in Spain.  Now it would be done digitally - if anyone would foot the bill.  <p>Big, "spectacular" films are still made.  But in an age where opening weekends mean everything, no studio would gamble such extravagance on the story of such a complex, conflicted man, who by some accounts was a sadomasochist and homosexual.  The film deftly reveals these possibilities without politicizing them or judging them.  Honestly there is little historical evidence for these ideas, anyway. What is known is the Deraa incident - a terrifying sequence in the film - where Lawrence was brutally beaten and raped by a Turkish general.  That this incident occured, and that it left Lawrence shattered, there is little doubt.  The film is circumspect about the details (it was made, after all, in 1962), but clear on its results: Lawrence went from being a gentleman warrior (almost an oxymoron) to a ruthless one. <p>The great achievement of Lawrence of Arabia is that it manages to  be an intense character study as well as a spectacular action film.  Neither aspect gets short-shrift.  The man and desert are so inextricably fused that one layer of the story shades into the other perfectly.  It is a masterful piece of filmmaking.  <p>There is much talk about the picture and sound improvements in the Superbit edition.  I plan to buy it soon.  But don't ignore this two-disc set, as well.  The second disc has a wealth of extra material, including a fairly thorough "making of" documentary that features interviews with many cast and crew members who worked on the film.  If you're not interested in these extras, then the Superbit edition is probably the way to go.  If, like me, you enjoy behind-the-scenes stuff as much as the film, then you should probably buy this one.  Or perhaps both.  <p>After all, they don't make them like this, anymore!</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>It is difficult to describe one of the greatest films of all times.  This film may even be the greatest film of all time.  Such sweeping statements are difficult to defend because opinions are exactly that, opinions.  Yet, this movie has much going for it that make it a must for any greatest films list, and makes the top of mine.<p>Let's begin with the peripherals.  At a time when sets were common, this movie was filmed entirely on location.  The desert scenes are all real.  I believe the interiors were all real buildings, though I can not verify that.  The music, most especially the theme, is unbelievable.  The soaring violins are well matched to the expansive desert vistas, stretching away into infinity.  The Arabian deserts are as immense as the American west.  Also important were the costumes, which were highly detailed and seemingly quite authentic.  Each and every aspect of this movie was so exceedingly well executed that it approaches perfection.  In one of the DVD extras Peter O'Toole mentions that he was expecting to be filming this movie for five months, and instead ended up filming it for two years and three months, one indication of the care and complexity required to create this film.<p>If you have yet to buy this movie, then please do two things.  First, buy the two-disk DVD with the marvelous extras, because they are worth having.  The black and white documentaries are short but interesting.  The interviews provide insight into those involved with the film.  Second, buy the biggest television set or monitor you possibly can, and be sure you watch this movie in wide screen format.  You miss too much with full screen.  In fact, the optimal way to watch this movie is to have a surround sound system and an HDTV set up for wide screen format.<p>The movie itself is a classic of classics, the story of an English map maker in service to his country.  Bored by what he is doing, he wants to see some action.  Soon he does, but the action in which he is involved changes him.  The movie is about how T. E. Lawrence grows from an idealistic young man to a battle hardened man who discovers that he likes killing, and yet is repulsed by it.  The movie also proclaims that T. E. Lawrence was one of the principals involved in Arab independence, and the movie is about some of the seminal moments in the uniting of many of the Arab tribes.  The movie also provides as much imagery about Lawrence's psychology as it does about his actions, because his psychology, from being able to put out a match with his bare fingers to calling for the elimination of a fleeing column of Turkish troops with the taking of no prisoners, provides insights into the complex psyche of the person of T. E. Lawrence.<p>The battles are exquisitely executed.  The fights are extremely well choreographed, and I admire the stamina and dedication of the hundreds of people involved in the creation of this movie as they created this movie in desert temperatures.  Given the care that is taken with safety in modern films, I believe this movie would be extremely difficult to film in the same way today.<p>Ultimately, the art, the story, the locations, the music, the script, the costumes and the action all come together to create an incredibly compelling and realistic story of T. E. Lawrence.  This movie is a must-have for a collector of great films.</p></br><a href="../users/AY46DEOJJYFTW.html">AY46DEOJJYFTW</a><br/><p>what more can be said about one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces in film history. The kind of film that could never be made today. Peter O'Toole is astonishing, Omar Shariff is mesmerising, Anthony Quinn amazing. The score by Maurice Jarre is legendary. The bigger the screen the better the viewing. There are some cinematic shots here that will literally take your breath away.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR.html">A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR</a><br/><p>This movie, which won best picture in 1962, features soaring desert scapes and an orchestral score that can sweep you away. Peter O'Toole plays T.E. Lawrence, the British major who led Arab tribes against the Turkish occupiers during World War II. A steller supporting cast includes Omar Shariff, Anthony Quinn and Alec Guiness. Lawrence unites disparate tribes of Arabs and leads them into battle, first taking Aqaba and ultimately, leading them into Damascus. His motivation is a mystery. Does he do it because he is an adventurer or, does he have a love of the Arab peolple, or, a hatred of the Turks? Perhaps, he is a bit of a rebel and can only operate in the British military performing a special service rather than serve in the regular army. Perhaps his rebeliousness leads him to compete against his British army superiors as he seeks to outdo them. We never can be sure.<br /><br />Lawrence goes through experiences that change him. He is not the same person coming out of his experiences, some of which are trying. Indeed, he becomes capable of savagry that even makes some of his Arab allies squirm. As great as this human dimension is, the raw beauty of the desert is what makes this film as great as it is. What an extraordinary job of location filming. A large cast engages in military charges on horseback and camel. These scenes are stirring. The actors had to learn to ride camels and they did so convincingly. It's a long epic and it might ne hard to see in one sitting but, conveniently there is an intermission, which is he point that divides disk one from disk 2. Also, there is a great documentary in the second disk in which Shariff, the late Quinn and others are interviewed. I recommend this great Oscar winner.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>Lawrence of Arabia is one of the finest films ever made.  It lacks a happy ending, but it is one of the most beautiful, sweeping, romantic, thought-provoking, historically accurate, and realistic epics ever made.  If you can believe Lawrence was Peter O'Toole's first film, and that he was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar and DIDN'T GET IT - then you will have an idea of the sad feeling you have at the end. David Lean directed this film, five years after he directed the Bridge on the River Kwai.  Lawrence's cinematography and music are sublime.  There are many, many very good actors in minor roles.<br /><br />The film tells the true story of T.E. Lawrence, a British officer who was stationed in the Middle East during WWI.  Lawrence donned sheik's robes and led fractious nomadic tribes in a successful revolt against the Turks.  The unusual army destroyed Turkish rail lines and drove them out of their stronghold in Akaba, paving the way for the British army to come in.<br /><br />Lawrence was enchanted by the harsh simplicity of the desert, and had a genuine love and respect for the desert tribes.  He wanted the desert to belong to the Arabs, but constant warring among tribes and imperialist intervention crushed his dream.  He returned to England disillusioned and bitter.  For more information, Lawrence's book "Seven Pillars of Wisdom," published in 1922.  Seven Pillars details his experiences in the desert with the nomadic warriors, and the revolt.  David Lean, the film's director, based the film almost entirely on this book.<br /><br />In the film, O'Toole plays the strange and unique Lawrence perfectly.  O'Toole's intense blue, searching eyes, his handsomeness and his golden hair lend to create and immortalize the mythic figure of this warrior-poet.  One thing you know right away is that they broke the mold when they made Lawrence.  O'Toole seems lost in the British military compound, and comes alive in the punishing environment of the desert.  His brave and courageous acts leads a sheik to become his friends.  Omar Sharif plays Ali. His tribe follows Lawrence through "the sun's anvil" on a risky mission to add a band of brigands to their army.  The leader of the tribe of brigands, Auda, is played by Anthony Quinn.<br /><br />The scenes up until Lawrence's capture and abuse by Turks are glorious and inspiring.  El Aurents, as the nomads call him, is the Braveheart of the Desert.  But as in Braveheart, as in war, things cannot always end as they begin.  Herein lies the heartache of war.  A scene where Lawrence loses his mind and takes it out on bedraggled injured Turks is incredibly painful to watch, considering all that has come before.<br /><br />Sharif is so passionate, and an incredible actor.  He is Lawrence's sole support and it is painful to watch his grief as his friend slips into depression and madness.  Like O'Toole, he too had an Oscar snatched out of his hand.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EBLL2OYEQJN9.html">A2EBLL2OYEQJN9</a><br/><p>This is an epic and powerful tale, both an international political thriller and an interpersonal drama about the amazing character T.E. Lawrence.  Lawrence of Arabia is a masterpiece that manages to impart an important history lesson in addition to some outstanding cinematography, brilliant acting by Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, and Sir Alec Guinness, beautiful landscape vistas, many quotable exchanges, and an intense character study of the conflicted T.E. Lawrence.<br /><br />Lawrence of Arabia is famous for its length, and having heard so much about the duration of the film, I was concerned about my own attention span.  To my surprise and delight, the movie was never plodding or drawn out.  Every scene served an important function.  Even the long desert-passage tale was purposeful, conveying to the viewer just how arduous and trying the journey was.<br /><br />Despite its well-deserved critical acclaim and historical significance, Lawrence of Arabia is not without its drawbacks.  It has a mediocre soundtrack, some laughable special effects (the quicksand scene), and night scenes that are fuzzy due to the lack of proper lenses and equipment.  I think the film is even greater due to these warts and imperfections.  Some reviewers have commented that the lack of any credible female characters (outside some tribeswomen in a group shot) is a drawback, but I couldn't disagree more.  The lack of a female lead makes the movie great, because it is realistic, and not contrived to some Hollywood standard movie formula.  Where do women fit into an early 1900's war, into a culture that oppresses women, and into the life of a homosexual military man?  The filmmakers should be applauded for not trying to fit a female lead into a movie which is about men.<br /><br />This is one of the all-time best movies in American cinema.  Don't miss out on this outstanding DVD release.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M9DQDGE07Q0U.html">A1M9DQDGE07Q0U</a><br/><p>Lawrence of Arabia is the thinking man's epic, a brilliant adaptation of the life of an English patriot and the Arab revolt captured brilliantly by director David Lean. Peter O'Toole is marvelous.  Alec Guinness superb.  Omar Shariff, enigmatic and compelling.  This film really represents a high point in 60's American cinema and film in general.<br />That Columbia Home Video chose to restore the film to its original length and Technicolor glory back in the 1980's is commendable.  That they mucked up the DVD transfer is irreprehensive.<br />Although color fidelity is stunning, edge enhancement, aliasing and shimmering fine details plague this transfer throughout.  It's frustrating to try and indulge in a story when the whole background surrounding the characters is in a constant state of motion.  There are many scenes free from these annoying problems but just as many ravaged by them.<br />Extras, a documentary, featurette, trailers and more are ample but presented with a considerable degree of edge enhancement as well. Also, the collector's keep case has trouble closing.  Overall, this two disc set could have been a much more stirring visual experience.  What a shame!</p></br><a href="../users/A3LU79BYMWZEW9.html">A3LU79BYMWZEW9</a><br/><p>One of the pleasures of my current job is that I selecting movies for this various  film series I run.  My current series is "100 Years, 100 Movies: Selections From the American Film Institute," and while I don't have the rights to screen EVERY selection, the many that I have gotten to show have initiated a good deal of discussion and debate among my attendees as to what makes a film a classic.<br /><br />Even at a glance at the AFI's roster of classic films, it was pretty clear that a wide variety of subjects, styles and genres would be open to us.  Greatness doesn't come in a one-size-fit-all format.  We began our series with CASABLANCA,  certainly a classic of its era--but one that caught its audience,  the critics and, yes,  even the actors and filmmakers by surprise. Shot in elegant black-and-white,  CASABLANCA is not quite an example of film noir--but it does have its `noirish' aspects.  And by the standards of the day, it was not actually a low-budget venture, but still no one involved in the project realized they were making a classic<br /><br />You could say that lack of pretention proven to be part of the beauty of the film.  It's one of the big screen's little ironies that it is often that very lack of pretention that makes for classic cinema.  And just as frequently, the bigger, more epic productions turn out to be bloated, boring and sometimes ludicrously bad.<br /><br />But not always.  Cinema can do many things, and in the right hands, a screen epic can be a wondrous thing to behold.  British director David Lean (1908-1991) is generally considered one of the masters of mid-20th century epic cinema (with such films to his credit as BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI,  DR. ZHIVAGO, and especially LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, hailed as the best epic film of all time by the American Film Institute,  the magazine Total Film and many others critics, film societies and publications.<br /><br />Aside from the twenty years--and all the attendant technical advancements between 1942 and 1962--that separated CASABLANCA and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA,  the two films do have a number of points in common: both speak to a certain fascination with exotic locales, the machinations and intrigues of war, and both pose questions about the nature of heroism and sacrifice.  And is it just coincidence, that both feature veteran character actor Claude Rains in co-starring roles?  (Who knows?  Maybe David Lean was indulging in a subtle kind of "stunt casting.")<br /><br />LAWRENCE OF ARABIA remains one of the most widely respected and influential films ever made.  While some have questioned its historical accuracy,  others have championed its cinematic beauty (and, yes, this is definitely one to view in letterbox format).Its visual style has influenced directors as diverse as Martin Scorsese, Sam Peckinpah and George Lucas. You can't get more diverse than that, and that very roster gives you an idea of how the notion of "epic cinema" has expanded over the decades.<br /><br />The film is also noted for its literate screenplay (another trait it shares with CASABLANCA and so many other "classic films") and for Peter O'Toole's impressive star turn in the title role.  O'Toole had appeared in smaller roles in three movies prior to making this film.  Interestingly, hewas not the first choice for the part, but Marlon Brando was not available, and Albert Finney turned down the role.  Producer Sam Spiegel had worked with O'Toole previously and wasn't eager to work with the Irish born actor again.  He did, however, yield to director Lean's better judgment--and the rest, as they say, is movie history.<br /><br />It's ironic that the film many consider to be the greatest epic of all time was made in the era (the early `60s) when the genre could be said to be winding down.  (But as suggested by the list of filmmakers who've felt LAWRENCE's influence, MAYBE the genre was just being redefined).  It was clear even then that the days of lengthy, grandiose film with a "cast of thousands," and actual intermissions were on the wane.<br /><br />It probably can be said in more recent years,  "epics" tend to be more in the sci-fi and fantasy realm, with the vert occasional historical film<br />surfacing from time to time.  It's ironic that the film many think of as the cinema's GREATEST epic was--in a technical sense anyway--one of the last true examples of the genre.  It probably had a lot to do with budgets, and with changing public tastes.  But then took, maybe LAWRENCE OF ARABIA just set too high a bar.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>When I first saw David Lean's "Desert Epic Masterpiece," I HATED the film, for reasons even I can't explain to myself now. I just saw this 3 hour, 46 minute movie again today, and...I LOVE it. The only way to see this movie (if not in theaters) is on the small screen...in WIDESCREEN, the way David Lean originally intended the film to be seen. And with panoramic views of the desert, Maurice Jarre's stirring score (notable for its being romantic, and yet there's no romance in the movie) and an all-star cast (including Alec Guinness, Jose Ferrer & Claude Raines), there is plenty to see and hear. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention Peter O'Toole's bravura performance as T.E. Lawrence, in the role that made him a household name. O'Toole is simply handsome and completely reckless as Lawrence, as daring as the man himself, I dare say. He radiates charisma, fire and passion in every scene. Jose Ferrer is equally venomous in his cameo as Turkish Bey (he's the one who played Cyrano De Bergerac on film in 1954, and won an Academy Award for it). Omar Sharif (who would go on to greater fame as Doctor Zhivago several years later) is simply outstanding as Sherif Ali. Anthony Quayle is a firebrand as Auda Abu Tayli (please excuse me if I mis-spelled his character's name). Jack Hawkins is appropriately haughty as General Allenby (I'll always remember him as Quintus Arrius in William Wyler's epic "Ben-Hur"), Claude Raines is practical as Dryden, George Kennedy is loyal to the last as Colonel Harry Brighton and the rest of the cast and crew (especially costume designer Phyllis Dalton) did a remarkable and fantastic job on this movie. I highly recommend it. Rated PG.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>I saw this classic many years ago when it first came out in 70 mm on a gigantic screen in San Francisco and was blown away.  Since then and periodically I have revisited this classic and have come to the conclusion that had David Lean never made another movie after this--he would still be considered one of the genius of cinema.  Keep in mind that this film influenced a young Steven Spielberg to enter the field of filmmaking (in fact he and Martin Scorsese had contributed to its restoration). And Peter O'Toole's debut performance is still one of the greatest ever captured on film!!  But that doesn't detract from the other fine actors in the cast such as the 74 yr old Claude Rains still vibrant, a brilliant Anthony Quinn, the cynical Arthur Kennedy as a disguised Lowell Thomas reporter and in his debut, Omar Sharif who becomes Lawrence's best friend and ally.  Aurally and visually arresting with much food for thought,"Lawrence Of Arabia" deserves to be in the top ten of great films that the AFI have designated along with "Godfather" and "Citizen Kane".</p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>...If all you want is to watch the movie.<br /><br />(Note: This is a review of the SUPERBIT version of this movie, though Amazon, in their infinite stupidity, will probably cross-post it to EVERY version of Lawrence and confuse the hell out of everybody.)<br /><br />Back in the days of watching movies squeezed onto squareish TV screens, watching Lawrence of Arabia always represented a compromise.  In fact, after an attempt or two I declared it unwatchable in that format and had to wait for theater revivals and eventually the large wide-screen TV and advent of DVD.  But now that I have those items I still have to compromise and keep two versions of Lawrence on my shelf--the standard two-disc set for all the featurettes, commentaries, and other goodies, and this two-disc Superbit edition for the movie itself.  For this version represents the clearest picture you are going to get, outside of Blu-ray or a 70mm cinema print.  There are no extras here because every inch of space on the discs is devoted to the picture and sound, which is the point.  So if you both love this movie and love all the annotation that goes with it, you have to own two version of this film.  It's as simple as that.<br /><br />The picture here is sharper than the standard DVD, and the colors are slightly more natural, not as saturated, with more definition in the hues.  But it's the *sound* where I heard the biggest improvement.  It's much fuller than the standard DVD, far less "tinny," and I probably don't need to tell you how vital Maurice Jarre and the London Philharmonic Orchestra are to the film.  (Bit of trivia: despite what the credits say, Adrian Boult did not conduct one bar of the film.  He had to always be credited as the conductor of the LPO for contractual reasons, but in fact Jarre conducted the score in the film.  If you knew anything about how Boult conducted, you'd know the poor chap couldn't in a million years master the techniques required for film music.)<br /><br />I'm not going to review the story, acting, cinematography, etc., here, save to say they're all extraordinary and make this film easily one of the greatest of all time.  But of course, if you're looking at this more expensive Superbit presentation you surely already know that.  The question on your minds is, do you need this version if you already have the standard-version DVD.  The answer for me is definitely yes, especially if you're watching Lawrence, as you should, on a large-screen TV with a good sound system.  Few films deserve *and* truly require the white glove treatment as much as this.  Next to it, Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey, made just a few years later and undoubtedly influenced to some extent by Lean's epic, seems like an intimate short.</p></br><a href="../users/A20JYIHL1W1U54.html">A20JYIHL1W1U54</a><br/><p>This is movie is an excellent WWI desert war film. I was captivated immediately by Peter O'Toole as T.E. Lawrence. What a strange character but he gets the job done. He gets the job done but whose job is it in reality? Jos&eacute; Ferrer as the Bey is perfect as the homosexual Turkish commander who leaves an indelible mark on Lawrence. The desert is eternal. This film is complex and perplexing in nature. This is probably David Lean's greatest directorial effort.</p></br><a href="../users/AO461REE0KA4J.html">AO461REE0KA4J</a><br/><p>** UPDATED SEP-07-2012 **<br /><br />There will be several different Blu-ray editions of this 1961 desert epic film from the US and UK in the coming days and months, and they are expected to look spectacular due to the latest 8K scan/4K intermediate digital restoration.  They will be in BLU-RAY ONLY, not DVD.  If you want DVD, you have to settle for older DVD editions, such as the one I reviewed below, which were made years before the latest restoration and thus don't look and sound as good.<br /><br />Two Blu-ray Region-A editions will come from the US: a cheaper 2-disc edition that is hard to search for on Amazon (search for B008Y1YK0I in the search box to get right to it), and a much more expensive 4-disc (3 BDs, 1 CD) box set.  These 2 US editions will come out on Nov-13-2012.<br /><br />Across the Atlantic, the UK will also release 2-disc and 4-disc editions that are expected to be largely identical to the US counterparts.  The 2-disc UK edition will be out on *SEP-10-2012*, a full two months earlier, and it will be an all-region release.  The 4-disc UK edition will be out Nov-12-2012.<br /><br />The 2-disc editions will carry pretty much the same bonus features as the 2001 DVD edition.  The 4-disc editions, which cost 3 times more, will have an extra Blu-ray disc with new extras, plus a soundtrack CD and a slight coffee-table book.<br /><br />** REVIEW OF 2001 2-DISC DVD EDITION BELOW, APR-06-2001 **<br /><br />Apart from the slightly soft, washed-out picture quality during the opening credits of the movie, the DVD edition of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is superb.  The movie itself is spread onto 2 discs, with the disc break occurs just before Intermission.  The Overture, Intermission, and the exit music are all played to a black screen, as per director David Lean's original wish.  The picture quality looks as fresh and clean as, quite frankly, any film made in the 90s.  In the dramatic shot where Lawrence appears on the far horizon after he rescued his Arab companion, the higher picture resolution of DVD makes it possible for us to notice his tiny figure whereas on VHS tapes or laserdisc it is so small it is almost impossible to see.  Anyone who is serious about watching this film should get this DVD instead of any other version in order to appreciate the opulent cinematography and majestic atmosphere of this epic.<br /><br />The disc has over 100 minutes of old and new documentaries and news footage about the making of the film, plus two well-designed DVD-ROM features (for Windows PC only): a interactive map showing the various journeys undertaken by the real T.E. Lawrence, and a "split-screen" feature that simultaneously plays the movie and shows you text of behind-of-scene information of the particular chapter of the movie that is playing.  Since the DVD lacks a second audio commentary, being able to watch the film while reading facts about it is not a bad substitute.<br /><br />The included "booklet" is a reproduction of the 1961 program given to theater goers, we are told.  A nice touch: the disc case resembles Lawrence's diary in the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>Peter O'Toole is the enigmatic T.E. Lawrence. It is an indelible performance. The entire film is mesmerizing and captivating from the opening to final shot. This is David Lean's masterpiece. Maurice Jarre's score is a true classic evoking images that are eternally grained into our memories.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CIW2OEVAJRM2.html">A1CIW2OEVAJRM2</a><br/><p>Directed by David Lean (famous from "Bridge Over the River Kwai"), "Lawrence of Arabia" recounts the true story of the British Intelligence officer T.E. Lawrence (d. 1935).  Lawrence was sent to Arabia during the First World War, and successfully operated behind enemy lines to unite various Arab tribes in guerrilla warfare against the Turks.  The movie focuses on Lawrence's fiercely independent and enigmatic spirit, which rebelled against the British regime under which he served, yet enabled him to be successful in his mission.  Lawrence does not share British colonist ambitions in Arabia but has his own agenda.  Lawrence goes against the grain by treating the Arabs with respect, despite their unfamiliarity with the guns, machines and bombs of modern warfare, and successfully forges important alliances with their leaders.  He secures their enduring respect and near religious devotion by risking his life for others, and accomplishing the impossible.  In the end, the question "Who are you?" is of deep significance: is Lawrence British or is he Arab?<p>Despite the World War I context, the movie doesn't focus on battle scenes, because most of the conflict is psychological or against the elements.  Lawrence's own character struggles and development are the focus, as is his interaction with Arab and British leaders.  But Lawrence's struggle is not only against a human enemy, but also equally against the hostile desert landscape.  With epic cinematography that leaves you feeling the desert wind and heat, viewers feel exposed to the elements as Lawrence was.  The fierce conditions in the desert and wild passions of the Arabs are wonderfully contrasted with the strict military discipline of the British army at their base with their generals sipping tea, and priding themselves in mundane achievements ("We've just built a new squash court").  There are a few battles scenes, featuring thunderous hooves, rifle shots, and war whoops, in an epic sequences involving thousands of men, camels and horses.  There are also a few scenes of violence and death (including execution, torture, and a massacre) that would be disturbing to children (they were disturbing to Lawrence!).  It was widely believed that Lawrence was homosexual, and there are a couple of aspects in the movie that could be interpreted as having homosexual overtones.  But on the whole the movie is about the man Lawrence, his passions and eccentric personality.  Lawrence's prime character trait was an ego that was bigger than he was, and this arrogant pride eventually destroyed him.<p>The change in Lawrence's character after he is tortured is somewhat sudden and hard to follow, as the man who was previously afraid of blood now shocks his men by ordering them to massacre a column of retreating Turks.  But this aside, it's a wonderful movie with adventure, epic sequences, extraordinary scenery, and good characterization. It still stands up remarkably well after more than 40 years, because never do you have the feeling that you are watching something thoroughly outdated.  Considering that the movie weighs in at well over three and a half hours, it's also lengthy.  Remarkably, there are no girls and no love story, but it works.  Most memorable are portrait of the man Lawrence (Peter O'Toole was relatively unknown prior to this film, but produced an immense performance in the starring role) and the spectacle of the harsh desert scenery (no doubt best viewed on the big screen!).  The passion of the characters, conflicts and cinematography are as powerful today as they were in 1962.  It's no wonder that this movie won seven Academy Awards in its time, and thirty years later is still regarded by many as one of the top ten of all time movie classics.  It may not be entirely accurate in its depiction of the history (the portrayal of Lawrence was sharply criticized by his family, and the depiction of Arabs is somewhat stereotyped).  But even if it's somewhat of a mirage, this classic is worth digging up from the desert of the past to watch all over again.</p></br><a href="../users/AGNOPNCN6FHB6.html">AGNOPNCN6FHB6</a><br/><p>true love for director's dedication to bringing this story to brilliant life with so many elements of character, culture, cohesion, and cinematic challenges... Peter O reigns supreme in this defining role that transforms his ego as well as his successful efforts to unite radically misaligned desert tribes, a feat comparable to Patton!  I treasured the lingering moments that demonstrated the tribal life and cross cultural assimilation... the pace was perfect for demonstraing the patient alignment of diverse goals with successful results... The overwhelming addiction of power and watching Lawrence dance in his new robes of freedom yielded a commensurate level of joy without the consicous responsibility of a wretched nation fighting for independence, albeit with limited success... How these war scenes were filmed is beyond my comprehension, have ultimate respect for the crew, actors and energy required to produce this phenomenal presentation.... what really happened with Effendi though, changed his whole mindset and the only plot hole I wish was resolved... v. v. high recommend!</p></br><a href="../users/A26IVJJTXOE85B.html">A26IVJJTXOE85B</a><br/><p>Lawrence Of Arabia is one of the greatest epics in film history. Clocking in at nearly four hours, the film recounts the British campaign in the Middle East as seen through the eyes of famed British officer, T.E Lawrence. Lawrence Of Arabia is a stunning picture with a terrific sense of atmosphere. Director David Lean's direction is flawless and everything about this film is epic. The acting, the score, the scenery, everything is grand. T.E Lawrence is brilliantly portrayed by Peter O'toole and he is definitely the right person for the role. The film is a visual treat as the color palette for the film is mostly beige, but the desert is beautifully filmed, and I would go as far as to say that desert is a character in the film. Lawrence Of Arabia is a beautifully photographed picture and is superbly acted. Director David Lean has crafted a true masterpiece of a film, and though quite long, watching the film is definitely worth it. The cast assembled do a great job on screen, and aside from Peter O'Toole I thought the best actor in this film was Alec Guinness. Lawrence of Arabia is a sweeping epic that remains a cinematic masterwork. The power and grandeur of the film speaks for itself. For people interested in the subject of T.E Lawrence and his legendary campaign, Lawrence Of Arabia is a great film to watch, and for those who enjoy classic epics, this is a must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PASRZ81DY9C.html">A1PASRZ81DY9C</a><br/><p>Viewed: 7/05, 12/07, 7/11<br />Rate: 10<br /><br />7/05: A magnificently stunning picture, Lawrence of Arabia is David Lean's best work. It is a story of a seemingly ordinary man who became extraordinary. The film is complexly made and is one of the very few most beautiful and breathtaking pictures made. Lawrence of Arabia far engulfs the epic films such as Gone with the Wind and Ben-Hur. The supporting cast gives extremely good performances.<br /><br />12/07: Lawrence of Arabia is undoubtedly a masterpiece, and it's among David Lean's best. Everything about Lawrence of Arabia speaks of volumes when it comes to epic pictures. It's actually meets the standard of epic pictures that Ben-Hur had set forth. The acting is excellent, the cinematography is resplendent, and the costumes are impressive. I am pleased with the use of hundreds of extras to make Lawrence of Arabia bigger than it seems. Peter O'Toole, in his debut, makes waves with his perfection of T.E. Lawrence, a character that is complicated and different. Not only he is an unusual kind of a hero, T.E. Lawrence is a dynamic person. Omar Sharif, who plays Sherif Ali, does a wonderful job in counterbalancing Lawrence. Anthony Quinn, playing Auda abu Tayi, brings momentum to the film through his characters. Alec Guiness, as Prince Feisal, performs just like how a king would. One of the most remarkable jobs that David Lean does with his characters in Lawrence of Arabia is not only to make them indirect but mysterious in terms of ambitions and wants. That's why Lawrence of Arabia remains a difficult picture to comprehend. And that is also why I keep re-visiting the picture from time to time. Having said that, Lawrence of Arabia is one of the most thrilling, beautiful pictures I've seen. How could I not forget that transition from one scene of T.E. Lawrence surrendering his destiny to next scene of men cheering and chanting his name loudly? That has to be very moving for anyone to see that. Seemingly ordinary, T.E. Lawrence is an extraordinary person; he doesn't even pass for a leader yet he can lead a country that isn't even his country. He is the kind of a person that Che Guevara aspired to be and never succeeded at being one. There have been many revolutionary leaders over the course of time, and T.E. Lawrence belongs in that upper echelon of the list. Living today in the year of 2007, Lawrence of Arabia sadly remains a lost art and is a true motion picture experience. To think of the film less than magnificent is a travesty. Ironically as Lawrence of Arabia is almost four hours long, I just wish it was doubled. As one would say, "Forget the length. Feel the quality." Indeed so!<br /><br />7/11: Lawrence of Arabia is simply one of the greatest movies made. I watch it all the time, and I never get tired of the beautiful cinematography. There are so many hidden meanings within the picture that I learn something new each time. All in all, a masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y87E22UVYCE6.html">A1Y87E22UVYCE6</a><br/><p>This film is a well deserved 7 Oscar winner. A huge production effort, 10 M dollars in 1962 was a record. To fully appreciate this opus, you should see it in a theater, no doubt, but if that is not possible don't miss it. VHS or DVD or Blue Ray will allow you to taste many of the great features of this movie.<br /><br />First: a gathering of actors performing in an unusual high level: Peter O'Toole as Lawrence, Omar Shariff as Sheriff Ali, Jack Hawkins as General Allenby, Anthony Quinn as Auda abu Tayi, Alec Guinness as King Feisal.<br />Not only those performances are outstanding, lots of secondary characters are also paramount: the two kids that followed Lawrence, Michael Ray as Farraj and John Dimech as Daud; the uncredited Turk soldier that holds Lawrence while he is whipped, gives an unforgettable expression, in a scene that takes no more than three minutes; the first Bedouin guide to Lawrence (Zia Mohyeddin); the British officers showing their elitist attitudes; almost all performances are remarkable one way or the other.<br /><br />Second: the music score of Maurice Jarre with some remarkable compositions that remain as a trade mark of the movie.<br />The more than beautiful photography from Freddie Young (with an extended career that include more than 130 films), desert pictures are overwhelming, not only sand but rocks and eroded mountains. Both winning Oscar.<br /><br />Third: the film director, David Lean (also Oscar winner), conducts with the same allure mass battle scenes and intimate dialogues between Ali and Lawrence, Feisal and Lawrence amongst other. No doubt he influenced the generalized high quality actor's performance.<br /><br />Fourth: the story is a forceful recreation of a critical war period with its political implications (still unresolved after almost 90 years). The intimate description of Lawrence divided loyalties: to Arab Cause and to British Empire. Of Lawrence's spiritual suffering: he was an intellectual and a mystic thrown in the middle of a bloody war conflict and having to lead human beings to death, suffering and destruction. Lawrence's internals contradictions: he enjoyed killing a man; afterwards, he was incapable to refrain his vengeance desires and lastly his failure to fulfill his promises. All this kaleidoscopic emotions are shown by Peter O'Toole with a compromise rarely seen; he gives real flesh and blood to his historical character.<br /><br />There are some minor historical inaccuracies (poetic licenses may we say?), King Feisal is shown as an elder man; in reality he was only a couple of years older than young Lawrence. Peter O'Toole was (approximately) 6 feet high (or 1.80 meters) and Lawrence was (approximately) 5 feet 3 inches high (or 1.65 meters), this is in a way minimized by how O'Toole managed his corporal demeanor.<br />An unforgettable film!!!<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />One of the few biographical movies to actually take a long, hard look at its subject rather than lionizing him or condensing his life into a formulaic 2 hour package, Lawrence of Arabia is an extremely long film but a fascinating one that deserves all the accolades it has accumulated: watch it if you haven't.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Between the direction of David Lean and the photography of Freddie Young, this is a fabulous visual treat, one to be treasured.  I'll certainly be interested to see what this looks like when someone makes a Blu-Ray version of this film.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the story as well as the great visuals, seem to dissipate in the last hour-plus of the movie. It just kind of peters out, like Lawrence's desert campaign.<br /><br />The acting, led by Peter O'Toole in the title role, is superb with the possible exception of Anthony Quinn, who overacts. Two of the all-time greats - Alec Guiness and Omar Sharif - also added life to this monumental epic story. This was O'Toole's first role, too, and probably his most famous and some think his best.as the premier actor in the business.<br /><br />For a film this long and with such little action, it's amazing it entertains as well as it does. For those who need some pretty women to aid in the story, forget it: in fact, there are NO women that I can remember. It gets by with the cinematography, O'Toole intense acting portraying a real-life vain, courageous, stubborn and obsessed Englishman trying to unite the Arabs to fight the Turks.<br /><br />Another very memorable and impressive aspect of this movie was the soundtrack. Is it my imagination or were soundtracks (like this one) more important and remembered better than movies in the last quarter of a decade? The main theme song is played throughout the film and I still remember it 47 years later.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>If any movie ever deserved to be on blu ray this is the one.  It is a cinematic masterpiece.  This two disc version has the best print around but it still needs a blu ray release.  This great picture has it all and you have 382 other reviews to tell you that.  The man the story is about proves that history is more fascinating than fiction and Lawrence was a great man indeed.  He had his troubles just like the great actor who protrays him in this  movie Peter O Toole , whose alcoholism robbed him of alot of his life by making it a giant haze.  Thankfully he's still around to provide us with great performances like he did in "venus".<br />Every scene in this movie is fantastic although they gloss over Lawrence of arabia's rape by the turkish troops.  In middle eastern lands it is quite common for many men guards or others to rape male prisoners and that incident drove Lawrence over the edge leading to him to slaughter the turks in large numbers.  Which marred the man's greatness to a degree, but in those days who could he talk to about it?  In spite of that watching this  movie is like watching perfection in cinematography and pacing. It just does everything right and the story is a important one</p></br><a href="../users/A2RH7ARWQSUVQV.html">A2RH7ARWQSUVQV</a><br/><p>Cinematography makes this film great.  I loved one of the first scenes in which Lawrence and his guide are dipping water from a well and see a shifting, ephemeral shape in the distance.  The shape gets larger and seems to be someone walking on water...or...at leasts someone walking on the surface of a shimmering mirage.  A rifle cracks and the guide drops dead.  The 'shape' is Omar Sharif on his camel and has killed the guide for the unforgiveable sin of stealing water.<br /><br />The movie is filled with similar images of the desert...beautiful, deadly and brutal.  Lawrence, in the form of the overly-tall Peter O'Toole [the real T.E. Lawrence was only about 5' 4"].  Still, O'Toole captures some of the strangeness and irony of a very strange Englishman.  Lawrence girds up the Bedoins to fight the Ottoman Turks.  They blow up trains and murder people.  They traverse an uncrossable desert to attack Al Aqaba on the Gulf with guns trained only on the sea.  After incredible hardship they succeed and slaughter the garrison.  Lawrence finds an interesting truth about himself...he enjoys killing people.<br /><br />Confusion about his very nature moves Lawrence in his leadership of the Arab cause.  Lawrence's leadership has, in its own way, become much our own problem in dealing with the Arabic and Islamic powers.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite, author of novels--"Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>This is a great film and one of my very favorite movies.  I love everything about it.  The exquisite length and pacing of this film can only work when the dialogue, acting, and pictures support it.  Here the movie is packed with everything wonderful from the first sound of the tympani to the credits.<p>My father always felt that Peter O'Toole was cheated when the best actor Oscar went to Gregory Peck for "To Kill a Mocking Bird" and I have always agreed with that view.  Nothing against Mr. Peck, but O'Toole gave a spectacular performance that has not lost its power over time.<p>While I am not a film scholar, I have always found David Lean a compelling story teller with his images as well as the dialogue.  Here, the images are so beautiful, powerful, and vast that they never leave the memory.  They become part of our visual language.  Who doesn't get thirsty when the Nefud is being crossed?  Whose heart is touched when Lawrence comes out of the Sinai into the officers club with the boy?  Who doesn't feel a mix of blood lust and revulsion in the battle scenes - especially at the train and the slaughter of the Turks on the way to Damascus?<p>The extras on the making of the movie and the reprint of the original theatrical program (though in a much smaller size) are quite good and valuable.  It is hard for me to get my kids to understand that we used to get dressed up to go to movies and they did sell program which people bought, read, and KEPT.  Different times ...<p>Yes, the events in which Lawrence played a part were a sideshow of a sideshow of the Great War, but they certainly get their monument in this great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>David Lean's masterpiece opens in Cairo during World War I where a young British soldier with a desire for adventure is assigned to help the Arabs fight the Turks in Arabia. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) proves to be a man of great courage and compassion. He unites the warring tribes of Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif) and Auda abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn). Together they are victorious in reclaiming several important Arab cities.<br /><br />Watching this glorious movie is worthwhile, even if it is on the small TV screen. It is refreshing to see a movie that is made without CGI: The sweeping desert vistas were filmed in real deserts and all the people are real. The unforgettable soundtrack by Maurice Jarre is as good as ever. Peter O'Toole is simple perfect as the conflicted Lawrence and Omar Sharif is also great as his friend, Ali. (Alec Guinness, however, is completely miscast as Arab Prince Feisal.)<br /><br />This true story of an ordinary man who accomplished extraordinary things is beautifully filmed and defines the word, "epic." It won seven Academy Awards in 1962, including Best Picture. Heartily recommended. (This DVD does not have any extras, but the price is right.)</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>The old expression that the book is always better than the movie is oh! so true!  The less you know about T. E. Lawrence, the more enjoyable this movie is.  Unfortunately, I have recently been reading both about Lawrence (both biographies about him as well as his own masterpiece, SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM).  There is always controversy regarding the extent to which the accuracy of the presentation of a historical figure should impact one's assessment of a work of art.  Unfortunately, I did find myself enjoying this film vastly less on a reviewing of it after actually knowing something about the subject matter.<p>Even after having looked somewhat into Lawrence's life, there are many things to laud in the movie.  It is unquestionably one of the most beautiful films ever made, with inconceivably gorgeous cinematography, one of the great musical scores in movie history, and one magnificently epic vista after another.  In no movie is the desert as beautiful and as alluring as in this one (just as Lawrence's own SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM is the great paean to the desert, excepting only Charles Doughty's great classic TRAVELS IN DESERTA ARABIA, which Lawrence took as his literary model).  And while there are some unfortunate casting decisions (at this point in history, one is always disappointed to see non-Arabs playing major Arab roles), Peter O'Toole dominates the screen in every shot in which he appears, with the most piercing blue eyes one can remember.  He is perhaps a tad too good-looking.  One is reminded of Noel Coward's quip to O'Toole, "If you'd been any prettier, it would have been Florence of Arabia."<p>But if you have read about Lawrence or read Lawrence's own book, certain things will disappoint on a reviewing.  First, one is disappointed by the presentation of Lawrence himself.  Although Peter O'Toole is unbelievably charismatic as Lawrence, he is on physical grounds terribly unqualified for the role.  One of the central factors in Lawrence's life was his height:  he was so short he had enormous difficulty getting into the military, only managing it after several high level friends pulled strings for him.  Great care was taken to disguise Lawrence's height, but the guess is that he was between 5'3 and 5'6, and probably towards the shorter figure.  O'Toole is a long, lean 6'3.  Despite some rough physical resemblance, O'Toole's height seriously hurts his ability to portray Lawrence accurately.  <p>I was also somewhat disappointed, upon reviewing, that the gigantic complexity of Lawrence's personality was not better reflected onscreen.  This is probably inevitable.  Lawrence was easily one of the most complex personalities of the 20th century.  Even after having read a pair of biographies, I feel that I know next to nothing about him.  His feelings about the Arabs, his attitudes towards the conflict he was involved in, his goals for himself in the Arab peninsula after the conflict, his masochistic asexuality (he deplored being physically touched by any human being, male or female, yet took delight in his ability to absorb enormous physical brutality, sometimes asking people to beat him with their fists in later life), and, perhaps most of all, his strange relationship to his own fame.  After the Arab conflict, he retreated first into the RAF and then into the Army as anonymous private under a fictitious name (in the army becoming Private T. E. Shaw, the "Shaw" homage to his friend Charlotte Shaw, wife of George Bernard).  <p>The movie also contains many historical inaccuracies, but this is more forgivable in that Lawrence's own book contains perhaps even more inaccuracies.  Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that it contains many embellishments and exaggerations.<p>Still, this is a great movie.  If you don't know much about Lawrence, see the movie before learning more about him.  You'll love the movie a great deal more if you do.</p></br><a href="../users/AD2BIAIH78QI5.html">AD2BIAIH78QI5</a><br/><p>The line I always remembered best, from David Lean's &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, is said neither by nor to the eponymous Lawrence played by Peter O'Toole. No, it's Anthony Quinn to Anthony Quayle, only two of the remarkable cast assembled for this desert epic tale. Who else is in this film? Besides O'Toole, Quinn, and Quayle, try Omar Sharif, Jose Ferrer, Claude Rains, Jack Hawkins, Alec Guinness, and Arthur Kennedy. How can you miss with a cast like that? Dead on perfect, every actor.<p>The audience is left by and large to decide for themselves whether Lawrence was a mystic, a fanatic, a rogue, a meglomaniac, or anything else that comes to mind. We see his start, from an obscure British army officer merely delivering a message to Prince Faisal to a commander of an arab army sweeping the Turkish Empire back as World War I rages in the Middle East as well. Here's a movie that really is a feast for the eyes, as nearly every few minutes there's an incredible shot of desert caravans or looting armies or a triumphant Lawrence ego-tripping out as he parades atop a derailed train.  &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; made the careers of both O'Toole and Sharif, and deservedly so. If you haven't yet seen this granddaddy of all epics, hoist yourself onto a camel and hunt it down.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This 1962 film is based on the true story of the unconventional British Lieutenant, who, during WW1, united Arab tribes to fight on the British side against the Turks.  How Lawrence did that was the result of his weird combination of charisma and  craziness.  And how director, David Lean, brought this epic to the screen is a result of pure genius.  Filmed on location in Jordan, the desert comes alive for the viewer.  It's mile after mile after mile of drifting sand.  But it also has places where there are lots of little rocks.  And then there are the few and far-between oases and wells.  There's danger here too, both because of the bitter tribal rivalries as well as natural dangers such as quicksand.  The camel is the accepted mode of transportation.  And thirst is something that the Bedouins learned to live with.  It's a harsh life.  The film is full of adventure.  And not just because of the characters or the action.  There's the adventure of the desert itself, and how a small speck on the horizon comes out of a mirage and becomes a human being.  This all comes alive by a vision, one that had never been done on screen before.  It was an ambitious undertaking. And a huge success.<p>The acting was outstanding.  And so were all the special effects, although the cast of thousands who were real live people.  It's a refreshing difference to computer-generated scenes we've become accustomed to.  And a type of filming that we will not likely see again.  For that alone, the film stands as a testament to human ingenuity.  A couple of details bothered me, such as the makeup on Peter O'Toole whose fair skin was supposed to look sunburned, but somehow looked as if he had thick clay on his face.  But this was minor. I also thought the film was too long and missed a traditional arc of plot which I've come to expect.  I found myself drowsing off during the last half hour as it all seemed repetitive and superfluous to what had come before. <p>I watched all the DVD special features the next morning.  And they were wonderful.  It was then I realized that the print I had watched had been restored in 1989, with 35 minutes added to the epic.  Some of the sound had been lost at that time and I found it fascinating as to how they brought back the actors to dub in their own voices again.  I love learning about all the background and hearing the actors talk about the experience. Don't miss this wonderful DVD.  Just make sure that you give yourself enough time to watch the film in its entirety.  And add on another couple of hours to see the special features.  You'll come away with an experience of your own that goes beyond merely watching a film.  Clearly, it rates one of my highest recommendations.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>As some have noted, seeing this film on DVD takes away much of its power.  It has to be seen in a 70mm print in the theater.  Films like this are why we go to the theater.  It's brilliantly shot, edited, scored, acted, and directed.  It's a literate, intelligent epic, and it was a box office smash.  It shows that audiences can indeed appreciate (even though this was 1962) a great film if given the opportunity.  Films like this inspire people to be great, to go beyond what they think they can do and do the impossible.  Look at this film...it has no romance, Peter O'Toole was an unknown, it's 4 hours, and it doesn't have a conventionally happy ending, yet, people still watched it and loved it.  Unlike many Hollywood biographies, this film doesn't white wash T.E. Lawrence at all.  It shows him to be a flawed, yet great, man.  The director David Lean and the screenwriter Robert Bolt are both British, and they should be commended for telling the truth about Lawrence.  It makes you feel more for the man than a sanitized biography would have.  According to Kevin Brownlow's book on David Lean, when the film was restored in 1989 (one of the first "restorations"), the audiences that saw it at its premiere were stunned.  They hardly said a word.  They thought it was one of the greatest films they've ever seen in their lives, and they were right.  I saw the restoration in 1989 and hardly moved.  The length of the film has nothing to do with its quality.  A good film is a good film, regardless of the length.  I would rather sit through a great 5 hour film than a 90 minute piece of [...]  If I had a theater, I'd show this every day.

Lawrence, Lawrence Of Arabia is widely considered one of the greatest films of the twentieth century. All-star director David Lean works with an extremely talented cast that includes Peter O'Toole, Alec Guinness, Omar Sharif, and Anthony Quinn. Nominated for ten Academy Awards, and winner of seven including Best Picture, Lawrence Of Arabia is a true film for the ages that no movie buff can afford to miss...<br /><br />British Lt. T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) is a military malcontent stationed in North Africa during World War I. Unexcited in his current assignment of coloring maps, he's thrilled when he learns that he's being reassigned as a British observer to King Feisal (Alec Guinness). Leader of a ragtag band of Arab rebels, King Feisal intends to overthrow the government of the Ottoman Empire (aligned against the British), oppressive rulers who dominate his land. And with the aid of T.E. Lawrence, he might well manage to pull it off...<br /><br />As Lawrence spends more time with his nomad friends from the Arabian peninsula, their cause of self-determination becomes his own. Working together, Lawrence and King Feisal's armies win victories against great odds, successfully sabotage enemy railroad supply lines, and successfully cross a barren desert where the odds of survival were thought to be nil. Along the way, journalist Jackson Bentley (Arthur Kennedy) catalogues Lawrence's exploits for an eager and admiring British public who read anything news related that concerns the exotic 'Lawrence of Arabia'. It's as if the British soldier were King Arthur himself. As King Feisal comes closer to giving birth to a new nation, T.E. Lawrence becomes as famous as any member of the British royal family...<br /><br />Employing a colorful cast of characters, breathtaking cinematography, and exotic Middle-Eastern locations, Lawrence Of Arabia is an epic of monumental proportions. Illustrating one man's fight for freedom alongside noble tribesmen fighting for self-determination against an empire that's ruled their families for hundreds of years, the film is rivaled by few of its peers. Modern in its subject matter, Lawrence Of Arabia pays an amazing resemblance to its contemporaries in its tackling of exotic locales and larger than life enterprises. Films such as Ben-Hur, Cleopatra, Spartacus, and The Ten Commandments set the tone for their era of film making, and Lawrence Of Arabia answered the call...<br /><br />Sporting an Oscar award-winning musical score and colorful set designs, Lawrence Of Arabia takes its viewers back in time to the era in which these events occurred. Few films have such an influential effect. With a critically acclaimed performance in his role as the title character, Peter O'Toole strengthens the film with the mastery of his craft. In short, Lawrence Of Arabia is one of the best films ever produced, and it's a definite must-see movie...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>How fortunate to be able to see to this editor's cut (221-minute) version of this 70-mm film in DVD format. With all due respect to the superior acting provided by all members of the cast, the desert remains the central character because of the exquisite care with which director David Lean presents it. How insignificant human activities seem when set within the context of the endless, timeless sand. Nonetheless, occasionally an exceptional leader emerges who -- for whatever reasons -- eventually acquires mythic stature. Such a leader was T.E. Lawrence, author of The Seven Pillars of Wisdom on which Robert Bolt's screenplay is based. Paradoxically, we know a great deal about his relatively brief life and career and yet in so many ways he remains an enigma. Like a force of nature, perhaps he can never be fully understood. This film traces his military career from Cairo in 1917 until just before his death in 1935 at age 47. Most of the film focuses on his efforts to help the Arabs to achieve their independence, leading their revolt against the Turks and then trying (without much success) to get the leaders to trust and cooperate with each other. (Given the circumstances in the Middle East today, this is an especially interesting subject which Lean examines in some depth.) The cast includes a number of distinguished actors such as Omar Sharif (Sherif Ali ben El Kharish), Alex Guinness (King Feisal), Anthony Quinn (Auda Abu Tayi), Jack Hawkins (General Allenby), Claude Rains (Dryden) and Jose Ferrer (Turkish Bey). However, O'Toole's commanding presence dominates each scene in which he appears just as Lawrence's force of will overcomes Arab doubts about his leadership.<p>For me, this film has lost none of its impact since I first saw it in 1962. Yes, it is an epic in so many ways but Lean wisely includes a number of intimate moments which remind us that these are human beings whom his cast members portray. To both the British and to the Arabs, Lawrence was an enigma...and so he is to me. I am reminded of Whitman's observations in Song of Myself: "Do I contradict myself? Very well, then, I contradict myself. I am large. I contain multitudes." The same can be said of O'Toole's Lawrence. Even by the conclusion of this almost three-hour film, we still do not fully understand the motives which drive Lawrence's behavior nor the demons which probably help to explain his immensely complicated personality. He seems to me to be -- like the vast dessert across which he establishes his celebrity -- a force of nature which is what it is, in some respects beyond our comprehension.</p></br><a href="../users/ALN0TTRTLHA4E.html">ALN0TTRTLHA4E</a><br/><p>Lawrence of Arabia was probably a person who fabricated most of his legend. Or at least this is what Aldington in a rather nasty biography would have us believe. Lawrence according to his own legend is meant to have helped he Arabs revolt against the Turks during the First World War, and thus lessen their ability to resist the British armies which moved up from Egypt to Syria. Aldington suggests that the Arabs did not become much involved in any military activity whatever and that what Lawrence wrote in his book the Seven Pillars of Wisdom was a lot of tall tales. Despite all of this the film although being a bit of pro Lawrence propaganda is one of the most brilliant visual spectaculars of all time. This was achieved long before the days of computer animation and without the use of models or any other tricks of the directors trade. It is best on the big screen with high quality speakers playing its remarkable sound track. The performances made the careers of the principle actors Peter O'Toole and Omar Shariff. Despite the fact that it is a very long film watching it one never has a moment of boredom and the time simply flies.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>Peter O'Toole is the enigmatic T.E. Lawrence. It is an indelible performance. The entire film is mesmerizing and captivating from the opening to final shot. This is David Lean's masterpiece.<br /><br />The performances of this film's cast are impressive. Omar Sharif gives probably the performance of his career as Sherif Ali. He is so natural and convincing in this role. Alec Guinness shows his talent for perfectly emulating the requirements of his role as Prince Feisal. Alec Guinness proves his worth as an actor's actor giving another conniving performance here. Claude Rains is excellent as the very wry Mr. Dryden. Arthur Kennedy as Jackson Bentley just shows us how good an actor he really was. He made it look so easy. Arthur Kennedy's legacy has been greatly overlooked.<br /><br />Maurice Jarre's score is a true classic evoking images that are eternally grained into our memories.</p></br><a href="../users/A25KKXUQQ0OLWB.html">A25KKXUQQ0OLWB</a><br/><p>One of my favorite movies from a young age.  Peter O'Toole is the great star of the film and Omar Sharif became a major star with this movie.  Lawrence of Arabia is a true character.  A man who in World War I was able to gather Arab tribes to bring down much of the Ottoman Empire while the rest of the British effort on the Eastern Front seemed to fail and die on the vine.  Becoming one with the Arabs and learning to survive in their environment and enjoy the life of the desert allowed him to be much more able to achieve British goals.  He also attempted to defy the British government by pushing for Arab independence rather than British Imperialism.  Wonderful movie and a great acheivement by David Lean.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EBHHCZO6V2A4.html">A3EBHHCZO6V2A4</a><br/><p>"Lawrence of Arabia" is a spicy, sensuous exploration of World War I-era Saudi Arabia.  It stands as David Lean's greatest cinematic achievement,and of the worthiest Oscar winners. For the most part, it's true to history about TE Lawrence, his exploits with the Arabs under the Ottoman Empire, and his personal struggles.<br /><br />Peter O'Toole is handsome&lanky as TE Lawrence (who,in real life,was rather dimunitive&homely) In the beginning, Lawrence is a bored officer in Egypt,working a desk job. His love of adventure gets him entangled in the liberation&unification of the Arabs. Alec Guinness is excellent as the sagely Prince Feisal, while Anthony Quinn is great as the stubborn tribal chieftain. Omar Sharif shines as Sharif Ali, Lawrence's friend, companion, and, knowing Lawrence's real-life inclinations, perhaps his lover. "Lawrence of Arabia" is a very masculine movie. It's not just because of Arab Muslim society, in which women are veiled&hidden. There's also the factor of Lawrence's homosexuality. The movie shows his two teenaged male companions,who may have been companions in an intimate sense. When Lawrence is brought before the Turkish bey (a slimy Jose Ferrer),the Turk strokes his bare,muscular chest. The movie hints at Lawrence's violation by the Turks. However, Lean doesn't show that after Lawrence returned to England, he had a male companion beat him on a regular basis. Lean is daring in hinting to Lawrence's queerness; the Production Code forbade ANY positive portrayal of gays. One can also say "Lawrence" is still revolutionary in portraying Arabs&Muslims as civilized&humane.<br /><br />"Lawrence of Arabia" is a majestic, marvelous film. The desert itself is a character, severe and pure. Maurice Jarre's soundtrack conveys the desert's beauty&power. The acting is superb. "Lawrence of Arabia" is an oasis in a desert of cheesy movies. It's a true classic.</p></br><a href="../users/AW003H7Z3OCHA.html">AW003H7Z3OCHA</a><br/><p>American Film Institute voted &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; the 5th greatest film out of 100 films in the last 100 years (1998).  Winner of 7 Oscars Including; Best Picture 1962 &amp; Best Director - David Lean.  The movie is based on the book &quot;The Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot; written by T. E. Lawrence.  This was Lieutanant Lawrence's tale of his adventures in Arabia during World War I while serving as a cartographer in the British Army.<p>T.E. Lawrence (played by Peter O'Toole -his first major role - Oscar nominee) was a British Hero who brought infamy to himself and his counrty through his deeds in Africa.  O'Toole's personifies Lawrence's character to the letter. <p>In Summary; The period was during the war in Africa against the invading Turks.  Lt Lawrence was an eccentric, interlectual &amp;  society outcast who joined the military to serve and explore the Arabian culture.  He manipulated his way into being a miltary advisor for the Arabs in their fight against the Turks.  Up until this time Lawrence was totally incompetent and disliked by all his fellow officers.  Well Lawrences genius and ability to befriend &amp; unite the feuding Arab tribes &amp; fight the Turks was nothing but unbelieveable since his fellow advisors had no success at all.  Lawrence not only unified the tribes, but was adopted &amp; elected by them (his British Officers hated this because of his independent nature) to lead their revolt against the Turks defeating them continuously. He was treated as a world wide hero &amp; devine leader and the rest is history.<p>This movie is the grandest in cinematic scale and the desert mesmerizes our senses.  We become totally absorbed in its splendor.  Digitally remasterd both in picture and sound presents the haunting immense scope of the desert beautifully.<p>The many extras on this DVD make you understand the complexity of the man &amp; the making of this &quot;Desert Epic&quot;.  A very long movie and an very slow evolving telling of this long complicated storyline.  David Lean is the master storyteller &amp; he does this beautifully.</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>This newly released DVD edition of this classic film illustrates just how unusual a movie experience was created with this movie. No one was a more masterful film maker than was David Lean, the British director who brought us such unforgettable classics as &quot;Bridge Over the River Kwai&quot;, &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; &quot;&quot;Ryan's Daughter&quot;, as well as this film. The cinematography is spectacular, even breath-taking, and one has to agree with the comments of a previous reviewer that here the desert plays a well-scripted supporting role in the unfolding drama that was T. E. Lawrence's experience during the First World War in Arabia.<p>Lean always focused his films on the ways in which individuals and their personal characteristics clash and meld with the larger social,cultural, and historical surround in which they are located, and so each film is a particularly captivating study of the specific dynamics of each such situation. Each of these films is also a well-choreographed and photographed excursion into the topography, climate, and landscape of the geographic location in which the drama unfolds. The eyes and ears are always delighted by what Lean displays. <p>Here young and bookish Lawrence is faced with the unenviable and unlikely prospect of trying to unite the multitude of Arab Bedouin tribes in support of the Allies in the regional warfare associated with WWI. The film captures this unlikely and somewhat quixotic personal odyssey most memorably, and a very young Peter O'Toole is masterful in his edgy portrayal of the enigmatic Lawrence as a time-trapped romantic caught by whimsy and circumstance in the most mind-boggling adventure of a lifetime, an adventure that broke all the rules of convention and upper-class British expectations. <p>He meets his match with other characters played by Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, and Sir Alec Guinness. And in capturing the comically mismatched skills, expectations, and romanticism that Lawrence projected into the larger picture of what was going on, by viewing his personal odyssey in the context of the much larger cultural framework of Arab ambitions, jealousies, and cultural differences, we are magically transported into the strange and marvelous world of the Arabian desert and all the romance and mystery of that region. <p>Viewing each of David Lean's splendid and classic films is a treat and a privilege; no one was as prolific, as consistent, and as engaging a storyteller as he.  &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; is one of his finest films, and as such represents a wonderful standard of excellence in storytelling and film experiences. Sit down and relax, for you are in a master's hands.

In making such a study, one inevitably and repeatedly encounters the name T.E. Lawrence, then and now one of the most controversial military figures of the 20th Century, a remarkably complex man who combined an unassuming manner with an astonishing flair for self-promotion.<br /><br />Lawrence authored an account of his Arabian adventures following the war.  Titled THE SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM, it has the very unusual distinction of being extremely famous before it was widely available: originally printed in a limited edition of 120 copies, it was widely praised, but it was not given a further printing until after Lawrence's death--at which point both those who served with Lawrence and historians alike noted that the work was much less accurate, much less factual than its first readers supposed.  Still, between the press coverage and the man's own gift for self-mythology, it was enough.  T.E. Lawrence was enshrined in memory as Lawrence of Arabia, and in the late 1950s and early 1960s David Lean set out to make a film about him, using THE SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM as primary source.<br /><br />A great deal has been made of the film's factual inaccuracies; a great deal more has been made of the film's failure to explicitly portray Lawrence's covertly sadomasochistic personality and homo-erotic edge.  But LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is not a film of mere fact; we must turn to documentary for that.  It is the myth, a vision of Lawrence as he himself wished to be seen, and the covert indications of his hidden nature adds greater depth to both his character and the film as a whole: as the story progresses we become acutely aware that there is much more that we do not know, a fact that lends a tremendous sense of mystery to the film.  Factual, no; explicit, no.  But in its entirety, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA achieves an artistic truth that transcends any mere notation of fact pure and simple.<br /><br />It is, in my opinion, the single finest film of epic scope to ever reach the screen.  The episodic story, scripted by Robert Bolt (author of A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS), casts a remarkably wide net, not only following Lawrence's adventures but placing them within a finely drawn context of diplomacy as well.  The cast is superb.  Led by Peter O'Toole in the title role, virtually every actor involved not only brings the various historical figures to vivid life, but transmutes them into archetypes as well.  David Lean's direction is flawless, as is the astonishingly beautiful cinematography, artful yet unobtrusive editing, and truly memorable score.<br /><br />It is true that LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is best seen on the big screen, where its visual power may be seen a full power; even so, it fares remarkably well on the small screen, much more so than epics that rely on visual power to the exclusion of all else.  There have been several releases to the home market, including a double cassette VHS and a two disk DVD with a host of extras--but this single DVD release, a "no frills" release without significant extras, offers a near-pristine picture and excellent sound, and I recommend for those who are not greatly interested in the history of the film itself.  Mercifully, the release also preserves the film's original ratio; I flatly state that pan-and-scan versions do a tremendous disservice to both the film and the viewer.  An unedited presentation of overture, intermission, and exit music is also included to great effect.<br /><br />Alternatively languid and violent, beautiful and disquieting, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is a remarkably fine film that deserves every praise heaped upon it since its 1962 release.  I cannot recommend it too highly.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer</p></br><a href="../users/A1T3O2LILVK0C4.html">A1T3O2LILVK0C4</a><br/><p>WARNING: This review contains spoilers!<br /><br />In 1962, director <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AGQ72">David Lean</a> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000F17A">Oliver Twist</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016K40KO">The Bridge on the River Kwai</a>) made cinematic history with his epic historical drama, Lawrence of Arabia. The film is perhaps one of the most daring and ambitious films ever made. Utilizing an amazing screenplay written by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson, Lean created a film that is an intimate character study, a harrowing war epic, a spectacular adventure and one of the greatest achievements in the annals of filmic history. Lawrence of Arabia has gone on to become a classic. It won seven Oscars and garnered international acclaim. Even its few detractors (most of which complain about the film's historical inaccuracies) will admit that it's stood the test of time and only earned more praise over the years.<br /><br />The film tells the tale of staff-captain and Lieutenant T.E. Lawrence, an English officer stationed in Cairo during WWI (at this time the Turkish Empire was ally to Germany and therefore a threat to British interests). Lawrence was a unique individual in that unlike most of his British compatriots, he understood that England's military was losing the fight against the Turks. He also understood that the various Arab tribes were warring against the Turks, but they were too scattered and disorganized to make any real progress.<br />Bored with his mapmaking and newspaper writing duties, he set forth a plan to get himself reassigned. He made himself out to be a general annoyance, obnoxious and peculiar. He managed to with the help of a senior officer, obtain a new position with the Arab Bureau. He would observe and chronicle the Arabs from within their encampment at Wadi Safra and evaluate their usefulness to the British war effort. Upon meeting Prince Feisal and his ill-equipped soldiers, Lawrence came to the conclusion that they were not only adequate as fighters but also courageous and dedicated. Their weaknesses were mainly that they lacked modern artillery, and that the various tribes were divided and constantly feuding with one another. Yet if they could be united, as one Arab people, against the Turks then they would stand a chance.<br />Lawrence upon fist glance might seem the most unlikely person to do this. Though he was well educated and possessed an unusual understanding of the region, he was awkward and outspoken, which made him seem arrogant. Lawrence's confidence at first offended the Arabs, who saw him as another cocky British officer, but they eventually came to respect his bravery and tenacity.<br />It becomes apparent that in order to defeat the Turkish army that the seaport at Akaba must be taken. But it cannot be approached by the sea due to the great immobile guns facing the water. It is decided that a small group of fifty men from the Harith tribe could take Akaba by land, but first they would have to cross 600 miles of desert and survive the "impassable" Nefudh desert. This treacherous journey tries them all and along the way Lawrence earns the respect of the Bedouin, especially Ali (who he first met on his way to meet Prince Feisal, when Ali killed Lawrence's guide for drinking from a Harith well). After saving a man's life, Lawrence is given the name El Orens and is presented with the robes of a noble Arab tribe.<br />Lawrence and Ali then manage to convince the Howeitat tribe to join them in their attack on Akaba, though they only agreed to do so when offered gold. Auda abu Tayi, the leader of the Howeitat, proves to be a great ally despite the fact that many of the Harith disapprove of Auda's mercenary tactics. Finally they reach Akaba and their surprise attack is successful. However Auda is disgusted when he finds only paper money and not gold. Lawrence promises that Auda will be paid with gold but first Lawrence must deliver word of their victory to the British.<br />He decides to take two young servants, Farraj and Doud, with him. The trek proves difficult and along the way Doud falls into a pit of quicksand and dies. Lawrence blames himself for the boy's death. When Lawrence and Farraj finally arrive in Cairo they are treated with prejudice and discourtesy. Lawrence has grown so accustomed to his Bedouin garments that he's not aware of how alien he appears to the other officers.<br />The new general, Allenby promotes Lawrence to major and orders him to go back but Lawrence refuses at first. He's tasted power and held many lives in his hands, and on some level or another he knows that giving him more responsibility would be a dangerous thing to do. Yet he agrees to Allenby's proposition when Allenby subtly builds up his ego with talk of making history. He is also lied to when he asks Allenby whether or not the British have "ambitions in Arabia" after the war. Allenby tells him that they do not. As Lawrence leaves the General's headquarters he's overwhelmed with congratulations, which only inflate his ego further.<br />When Lawrence returns to the desert he brings British ammunition and armored vehicles. His name becomes infamous and he is viewed by many as a hero. This is a fact which numerous journalists wish to exploit and in so doing encourage support for the war effort. Meanwhile Lawrence wages a guerrilla war against the Turks. He and his army attack the railway systems, weakening the Turkish forces one train at a time. He relishes the praise and adoration that is showered upon him but he begins to delude himself. After almost being killed by a gunman he jokingly says, "Didn't you know, they can only kill me with a golden bullet?"<br />After months of fighting most of the Howeitat tribe have gone home and even Ali seems to be concerned with Lawrence's state of mind. After one of the attacks goes wrong Farraj is severely wounded and Lawrence is forced to kill him so as to spare him the unimaginable tortures that the Turks would use to extract information from him. Haunted by guilt, Lawrence recklessly decides to move ahead in his plans. He tells the few remaining Arabs that he intends to attack Deraa.<br />Meanwhile the British general, Allenby begins to wonder if Lawrence has "gone native". He fears that Lawrence no longer serves Britain but instead fights to guarantee Arab independence. His fears are justified. Lawrence, full of pride and false bravado, continues with his plans to advance to Deraa. The Arabs refuse to join him in his folly. So Lawrence goes alone, accompanied only by Ali. There Turkish soldiers capture him, though they never discover his identity. He is interrogated, beaten and brutalized before they release him. Lawrence is forever changed by this incident. He becomes insecure and disenchanted. His mind is polluted with doubts and anxieties. He decides to give up and allow the Arab revolt to be carried on by others. Ali and many of the Harith tribe feel betrayed and abandoned when Lawrence leaves.<br />Upon his return to British headquarters, Lawrence is treated like an outsider. He meets with General Allenby and learns of a proposed treaty between France and England, who after the war intend to share the Turkish Empire... including Arabia. Lawrence is outraged. He requests to be reassigned to a lesser position but Allenby manipulates him and talks him into leading the upcoming attack at Damascus. Lawrence buries his insecurities with anger, hiding his vulnerability with defiance. He agrees to lead the attack on Damascus if Allenby will nullify the treaty and guarantee that Arabia will be left to the Arabs. Allenby reluctantly agrees.<br />When next the Arab army assembles, Ali sees a great change in Lawrence. He sees a man who is over confident and vengeful, bloodthirsty and guilt ridden. Lawrence now surrounds himself with vicious mercenaries who act as his personal bodyguards. On the road to Damascus the Arabs encounter a small town devastated by the Turks and Lawrence, prompted by his bodyguards and repulsed by the Turks, orders a bloody attack. "No prisoners!" he shouts with indignant rage. When the battle is over, Lawrence finds himself covered in blood and surrounded by dead Turkish soldiers. He's horrified by the pleasure he derived from the killing. Even those men who once admired him now look on him with fear and trepidation.<br />Lawrence and the Arabs arrive in Damascus and they immediately form a committee. At the town hall they have a meeting to discuss the creation of a democratic Arab government but the Arab tribes have for too long fought amongst themselves. His attempt at uniting them proves to be in vain.<br />The film ends with its viewers asking themselves whether Lawrence's actions were altruistic or motivated by a hunger for glory, whether he was devoted to the Arab revolt or to his own hopeless search for identity.<br /><br />Clearly he was in real life a tragic hero, a complex man with great dreams and aspirations. But he was a man weighted down by flaws, flaws that sabotaged his potential to make wonderful changes in the Middle East.<br />The cast is amazing. Peter O'Toole is riveting in his portrayal of the enigmatic Lawrence and Omar Sharif, as Ali, gives a complex and multi-faceted performance. The rest of the cast is also wonderful particularly Anthony Quinn as Auda abu Tayi, Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal, Jack Hawkins as General Allenby, Anthony Quayle as Colonel Brighton, Claude Rains as Mr. Dryden, and Jose Ferrer as the sadistic Turkish Bey who orders Lawrence to be beaten. The cinematography is breathtaking in its scope and gives the illusion that the desert is unending. The music by Maurice Jarre is incredibly powerful. It evokes images of sand swept dunes and bloody battlefields. It's no wonder the film is recognized as one of the best ever made.<br /><br />At the time of writing this review there are four available versions of Lawrence of Arabia on DVD. The first is a bare bones single disc release, the second is an impressive 2-disc Limited Edition, the third is the Superbit edition, while the fourth and most recent is the 2-disc Collector's Edition. Of the four DVD releases I would recommend the last three.<br /><br />For those interested in the historical Lawrence, I also recommend:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1846774209">Revolt in the Desert</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385418957">Seven Pillars of Wisdom: A Triumph</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014EAX0I">Lawrence and Aaronsohn: T.

The first is about how an ordinary guy becomes a hero, with derring do that's an unacknowledged precursor to both the Indiana Jones and Star Wars movies as much as it influenced more &quot;serious&quot; works.<p>For my money, though, the second half is where it really gets interesting, because I don't recall seeing many other films that actually tackle what happens when someone has to live up to being a hero -- especially a film that will take the question seriously, rather than use it as a chance for Movie of the Week schmaltz. The decline and fall of Lawrence is as gripping as any other film I've seen, and would stand on its own as a film classic even without the lead-in.<p>Together with beautiful vistas -- not seeing this in letterbox is a flat-out crime -- the greatest moments of some classic actors (see why Omar Sharif actually deserves his big name recognition) and amazing set pieces decades before &quot;Braveheart,&quot; &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; has something for everyone: It's a serious art piece, it's an action movie, it's an adventure.<p>And it's a well-deserved classic that should be seen by everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>No one was a more masterful film maker than was David Lean, the British director who brought us such unforgettable classics as "Bridge Over the River Kwai", "Doctor Zhivago" ""Ryan's Daughter", and of course, "Lawrence  of Arabia"(see my reviews of all these films).

In fact there's no need at all to make that statement. I'm not telling you anything you don't already know. Actually there's nothing I could say about this movie that hasn't been said 100 times before. I can't offer anything new or insightful. I can merely join the hopefully (?) hundreds and upon hundreds of people who love this movie.<p> Released in 1962 and directed by David Lean, the man many people think of as the master of the epic through such films as "Doctor Zhivago" and "Bridge on the River Kwai" (Which also won "Best Picture") "Lawrence of Arabia" is perhaps Lean's most popular and influential film. It is a piece of great story telling. And to think this was one of Peter O' Toole's first roles (In the credits it states "introducing" which usualy means an actor\actress first film. But if you go on IMDB.com it states it was his third movie.). It is a tour-de-force performance. Truly amazing and it honestly should have gotten him the Oscar. It's a shame he's never won, except for the special Oscar that he was awarded.<p> "Lawrence of Arabia" is based on actually writings of T.E. Lawrence. The screenplay by Robert Bolt abd Michael Wilson does in fact remain truthful too many moments. Which is unusualy for a Hollywood movie.<p> Also part of this all-star cast is Alec Guinnes, Anthony Quinn, Omar Sharif, Jose Ferrer, & Claude Rains.<p> Like I said before I really can't offer anything new to say but, just please make an attempt too see this film if you haven't. It will turn out to be a worthwhile experience. This is one of the greatest films of all-time. Nominated for 10 Academy Awards the movie won 7.<p> Bottom-line: One of the greatest films of all-time. And one of many masterpieces to come from director David Lean.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N49TOJZFG48H.html">A1N49TOJZFG48H</a><br/><p>if you've paused here to read this than you already know what i'm talking about . this film as well as AVATAR is filmaking on an epic scale . sans computers . i don't need to compare and contrast these two films . you'll either agree or not approximately a paragraph ago .

He's been in a total of maybe TWO films that had any kind of patina of class at ALL, ("My Favorite Year" and "The Last Emperor", the latter by the repugnant Bernardo Bertolucci,) the rest have been totally missable pieces of fluff or outright stinkers. But THIS film is what started it for him... a run of more than twenty years of some of the best movies ever made.<br /><br />I am a big fan of that O'Toole, the O'Toole that starred ONLY in exceptional films, like "The Lion In Winter", "What's New Pussycat", "The Ruling Class", "Great Catharine", etc., and revisiting this film makes it all obvious why. Like I've said before, O'Toole is one of the two "crown princes of intense", the other being Richard Burton, and he gives us a good preview of his style here.<br /><br />This is the story of Thomas Edward Lawrence, (who O'Toole resembles not one whit,) the British officer who helped the Arabs liberate themselves from Turkish rule. It shows the stoicness of spirit and the fiery resolve Lawrence had to bring  off his goal successfully. It shows the devotion the Arabs he befriended had for him. Lawrence BECAME an Arab to lead these men, who had become moribund, thinking that their cause was hopeless.<br /><br />Anthony Quinn, Alec Guinness, Jose Ferrer and Omar Sharif, (in what was also HIS first movie,) acquit themselves decently as Turkish and Arab chieftains and bigwigs, with Guinness portraying a rather unconvincing King Feisal, and Quinn sporting the most OBVIOUS prosthetic nose I've ever seen in the movies.<br /><br />This film wrote the book on grand scale and scope as it displays scene after scene of confrontations both mano a mano and battles with a cast of thousands, all of it brought off very realistically. The cinematography is excellent, the art direction realistic, (this was one of the first "dirt-under-the-fingernails" period movies to be shown, along with "Taras Bulba", both in the early sixties,) and the acting almost perfect! If you want to see one of the last of the great epic films, (for this surely WAS one of the last to actually MEAN anything,) rent or buy this great film, the first big film for O'Toole and the VERY first international film for Omar Sharif!<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>There's no getting around a simple, basic truth: watching Lawrence of Arabia in any home-video format isn't doing the film any justice, but to see it projected in 70 millimeter onto a huge theater screen is the only way to give this film it's just rewards. David Lean's masterful &quot;desert classic&quot; is still enjoyable on the small screen. Peter O'Toole gives a star-making performance as T.E. Lawrence, the eccentric British officer who united the desert tribes of Arabia against the Turks during World War I. Lean orchestrates sweeping battle sequences and breathtaking action, but the film is really about the adventures and trials that transform Lawrence into a legendary man of the desert. Lean traces this transformation on a vast canvas of awesome physicality; no other movie has captured the expanse of the desert with such scope and grandeur. Equally important is the psychology of Lawrence, who remains an enigma even as we grasp his identification with the desert. Perhaps the greatest triumph of this landmark film is that Lean has conveyed the romance, danger, and allure of the desert with such physical and emotional power. It's a film about a man who leads one life but is irresistibly drawn to another, where his greatness and mystery are allowed to flourish in equal measure. As for the DVD tranfer, I'd have to say that I've only seen the DVD version of the film, so I can't make comparisons, but I think that the transfer is perfect. Great film, a definite must see!</p></br><a href="../users/A3VUO1LJGMSZQY.html">A3VUO1LJGMSZQY</a><br/><p>These many years ago, was thrilled to get this ON DVD! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006ADD5">Lawrence of Arabia (Single-Disc Edition)</a>. Fast forward to June '12, "wonder if on blu": astounded that no release yet offered for this classic. Did some research, then ordered Superbit dvd <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AGQ6Z">Lawrence of Arabia (Superbit Collection)</a>, for picture quality, and 2 disc set <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXB2">Lawrence of Arabia</a>, for myriad of extra features. Each of these latter purchases were $6.00 (flawless used condition), and you can NOW get the 2 disc (non-SB) NEW for $6.00 (list $40) from Amazon!! Both of these releases are terrific in presentation AND packaging (2 disc has elegant cloth cover even!). Am just now seeing that blu WILL be released -in this country- in November, coincidentally just in time for black friday (having been earlier released in Sept '12 for Eng,Swe,Den)! AND, for now, if you "need" the blu, big bucks will be needed to procure this massive box set, with its oh-so-unappealing cover art (imho). HIGHLY recommend that if you can be content with a measly dvd, or want to purchase for a film fan -not caught up in need for "latest/greatest"- than the 2 disc cloth cover set -six bucks!- would be the ticket. (I note that many folk insist upon "only way to view proper is on big screen". My big screen is 50", so am content with these fairly recent dvd releases.) The Superbit version did get highest marks for video quality, and included DTS audio, when released in '03. ...but enough of rant, let's enjoy the film already (or can't we, "unless . . .?")<br />7/28/12 UPDATE: while watching "making of", discovered that new "unappealing cover art" is actually from original promotional campaign; had just never seen it before, so stand corrected on it's blu inclusion. After watching Superbit version this date, decided that I will eventually get blu, when single comes out. Sweeping, panoramic sequences -though very nice on BOTH older versions just bought- can only be fantasied about in pending hi-def format!<br />**9/6/12 final update! 2 disc blu now avail. for pre-order, $18.99. Life so good!**</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I think this sites product review says it all, even though it thinks it's saying something else.  The review says "If your only option is to view a `pan & scan' version, it's best not to bother; this is a film for which the widescreen format is utterly mandatory."  Now, what they are saying without realizing it is that this movie is less a film and more a spectacle.  It's a mere Hollywood blockbuster masked over and presented as an Oscar caliber production.  I know that this is a film lauded by many and is considered one of the greatest films of all time, but in all honesty I have to say that it is a beautiful yet somewhat empty film.<br /><br />It reminds me of my feelings on `The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' or even `The English Patient'.  Really though, I probably consider both of those films to be better than this one.<br /><br />The film tells of T.E. Lawrence's uniting of the Arabian tribes during his military service in World War I.  As he works with the tribes as they wage war against the Turks he begins to realize a part of himself that he didn't know before.  Sadly, he remains such an enigma that we as the audience don't ever really get to know him.<br /><br />That's my biggest issue here.  "Lawrence of Arabia' is like a really pretty painting.  It has beautiful landscapes and beautiful people, and yes, on a big screen it looks utterly amazing; but like that picture the purpose of `artist's intent' is left up to the audience to uncover alone.  It is an ambiguous journey that winds up being unfulfilling since we are given little to no real insight on who this Lawrence really is.  Peter O'Toole tries very hard, and with what he is given he delivers quite well, but in the end he cannot shed much light on this man and thus his efforts go forth unsuccessful.<br /><br />There is a story here, one of heroism, that is tackled pretty well; and there are certain moments where there is a glimmer of light on this man (especially when Lawrence admits to liking taking another man's life) but overall I feel that this film is rather empty.<br /><br />I love how some who are so devoted to this film feel the need to say that if you find this boring or don't like it then you must have the attention span of a hummingbird (direct quote there).  Truth be told, I've sat through Bergman's four hour masterpiece known as `Fanny and Alexander' as well as his six part conversation `Scenes from a Marriage' and I found it completely riveting and utterly absorbing.  Could it be that we find this boring because it is.  Boring has nothing to do with how long a film is or how loud and action filled it is.  Boring has to do with finding now emotional connection to a film.<br /><br />I found no real connection here.<br /><br />Director David Lean has received a lot of praise for his directorial efforts on this film; but I think that praise is blind and somewhat one sided.  We have to remember that directing is more than painting a pretty picture, for it is up to the director to engage the audience's emotions as well.  I said this before with regard to Minghella's work in `The English Patient' as well as Fincher's emotionally vapid work in `Benjamin Button', and recently some friends and I were discussing Mel Gibson and his lack of emotional connection in his work, most notably `Braveheart'.  These are specific cases of directors who can visually stimulate us yet fail to capture our emotions (I want to make a brief note that NORMALLY Fincher and the late Minghella are brilliant directors; these are just two cases of times when they weren't complete in their directorial efforts).  Lean falls in that category for me here.  He struggles to find a human connection and thus winds up giving us half a movie.<br /><br />It's beautiful to look at, that is for certain, but it's really nothing more than that.</p></br><a href="../users/A17NFLRFTMYXF5.html">A17NFLRFTMYXF5</a><br/><p>T.E.

I'll start my review by listing the strengths of this film.  David Lean was the last great director of historical epics.  He has all the elements in place here: great cinematography, editing, a fantastic score by Maurice Jarre.  Peter O'Toole's debut is nothing less than astonishing.  He does not so much star here as Lawrence but embodies the man, with all the contradictions and complexities.  There is a great supporting cast here with Alec Guiness, Omar Sharif, Jack Hawkins, Claude Rains, Jose Ferrer.  But...this film is just so long.  I understand that what Lean is trying to convey here is that the unification of the Arab tribes against their Turk opressors was a long and deliberate process.  And we in the audience feel the long and deliberate process.  If Lean wants us to feel that the trek through the desert was arduous, well, he has succeeded.  My review of this film is not based on a single viewing of it.  I have seen it many times but getting through it is hard work.  In a nutshell, I admire this film but I don't particularly enjoy it.  On a final note, the first time I saw "Lawrence of Arabia" about 20 years ago at a repertory movie-house, about three-quarters of the way through it the theatre lights came on and the theatre manager came out and told the audience that they were missing the last two reels of the film.  Imagine my dismay after investing well over two hours of my time to this film and not knowing how it ended!!!  It's possible that initial exposure to this film colored my impression of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>Lawrence Of Arabia is one of the biggest and grandest films ever made.  Director David Lean crafted a stunning epic that tells the tale of World War I British soldier T.E. Lawrence.  Lawrence joined the various desert tribes of Arabia against the Turks and the desert battle scenes are breathtaking.  Peter O'Toole is amazing as Lawrence in what would be a star-making turn for him.  Omar Shariff, Anthony Quinn and Alec Guinness provide strong support, but this is Mr. Lean's film through and through.  His direction provides sweeping shots of the desert vistas and gives the film its big look, but he also allows the story to flow and we really get inside the complicated head of Lawrence and see his psychological foibles.  The film is beautifully transferred to DVD and it brings justice to the film that had previously suffered on video transfers.  The movie was a major success as it swept through the 1962 Oscars winning Best Picture and Best Director, but Mr. O'Toole lost out on what would be the first of his of his seven unsuccessful Best Actor nominations.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3F04ZK7FG66.html">A2E3F04ZK7FG66</a><br/><p>It's hard for the small screen to do justice to such a sweeping cinematographic epic, but there is much more to this film than its visual majesty. The film has one of the most beautiful and recognized scores in the history of cinema, a fascinating subject in the person of T.E. Lawrence himself, one of the most literate screenplays ever written, and a wonderful supporting cast nearing perfection. It is a shame that unless you take the time to buy the DVD and invest the almost four hours it takes to watch it, you are likely to miss out on one of the best films ever made. It is precisely because of its length that it is seldom seen on TV anymore. The backdrop of the film is that the British, in the midst of fighting World War I, are aiding the Arab struggle for independence from the Turks since anything that ties up the Turks accomplishes the British goal of destroying the Ottoman Empire and thus aids in the war effort. T. E. Lawrence is first enlisted to help advise the Arabs in their military goals, but goes on to lead them in a series of stunning military victories that goes way beyond what the British expected of the Arabs, and quite frankly, way beyond what the British wanted. You see, the British had designs on claiming Arabia for themselves after the war ends, years before it was discovered that Arabia was sitting on the world's richest oil supply.<br /><br />However, this is really an oversimplification of a very complex film.  This movie is so multi-faceted that you could tackle reviewing it from several angles. To me one of the most fascinating aspects of the film is the complex relationship and contrast between Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif), fellow tribesman and counsel to Prince Feisal, and T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole). When the two first meet Ali shoots down Lawrence's Arab companion who is taking him to first meet Feisel because the man is drinking from Ali's well and does not have permission to do so. An outraged Lawrence chastises Ali citing that Arabia will never be great as long as they war amongst themselves and that he is "barborous and cruel". Towards the end of the film, though, there is a reversal of roles as Ali tries to stop a massacre that Lawrence is not only allowing his troops to participate in, but seems to be genuinely enjoying. Ali is a man who has a good bead on who he is and what he believes. Not having this quality is Lawrence's greatest shortcoming. Lawrence either believes he is much less than he is or much more, depending on his latest exploits and who has talked to him last. Ali clearly sees this problem, and by the end of the film Ali is Lawrence's fast friend - in fact his only true friend. You see, Lawrence is being used by both the Arabs and the British. This becomes immensely clear when at the end of the film Prince Feisel, who has always seemed to be genuine towards Lawrence, says during negotiations with the British "Lawrence is a double-edged sword - We are equally glad to be rid of him, are we not?".  By the way, the role of Ali has to be Sharif's finest hour as an actor. I always thought Dr. Zhivago was that finest role, and it is still a great performance, but this one is even better.<br /><br />There are so many other themes going on in this film - the thin line between madness and heroism, the worth of a single human life versus the welfare of an entire army or a nation, the sometimes less than honorable motives behind those fighting for the honorable goal independence, the contrast between western and Arab values - that you could go on forever. That is why I strongly recommend this film. You'll probably come away with something a little different on each viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2V3P1XE33NYC3.html">A2V3P1XE33NYC3</a><br/><p>I am embarrassed to admit I never watched David Lean's 1962 film "Lawrence of Arabia" until quite recently. I never went out of my way to avoid the picture, and I'm definitely a fan of Peter O'Toole (a rather passive one, I admit), but this movie just never found its way onto my play list. A lot of my hesitation to sit down with this epic centered on its incredible run time. "Lawrence of Arabia" clocks in at nearly four hours, or the amount of time it would take me to watch two or even three schlock pieces of junk. A friend at the university finally convinced me to rent the movie, although his claim that "you just gotta watch it" fell on deaf ears. I don't "gotta" do anything as far as I'm concerned, especially when it comes to motion pictures. My rental patterns operate on fairly obscure principles that even I don't understand, and it sometimes takes a lot of work for me to move a film to the top of my list. I conceded in this argument, however, and promised that I would green light "Lawrence of Arabia" immediately. Of course, I couldn't believe I waited so long to see the movie after watching it.<br /><br />Lean's film begins with a very short introductory piece showing us the demise of T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) in a motorcycle accident followed by a rather prestigious looking funeral service. Several English elites make contradictory statements about the man, ranging from panegyric to barely disguised scorn. It's an intriguing way to start the film because it makes the viewer wonder what sort of chap could rub people in so many different ways. Then we learn the backstory. Lawrence works for the British as a map maker and reader in Cairo when he learns about a rare opportunity: the country needs men to visit with the Bedouins in order to secure their support for war against the Ottoman Turks. It's a tough job, one that requires brains as well as brawn, but Lawrence eagerly signs on despite very real doubts concerning his ability to accomplish the task. Off he goes, into the desert and to his destiny as a military genius. His adventures in the sands of Arabia soon attain the mark of legend, as he manages to unite various warring factions into a cohesive army that causes serious damage to the Turkish forces on the continent. He is less successful reconciling the strategic aims of the British and Arabs as the war draws to a close.<br /><br />I'm going to depart from my standard two-paragraph summary with "Lawrence of Arabia." There is too much going on this film, too many plot twists and turns, to do justice in a short review. The first thing that strikes the viewer about this movie is the stunning cinematography. Lean wisely recognizes that to tell the story of T.E. Lawrence, he must include the desert as a major character. It is the harsh, sun blasted environment of the Middle East that informs every action taken in the film. Sand dunes and rocky crags stand in the background of the film with grim oppressiveness as well as stunning beauty, either pressing down on the small humans wandering among them or embracing them depending on the circumstances. Extraordinarily long tracking shots filmed with special lenses bring home the arduousness and danger of traveling through the desert. Just as important as the climate are the characters, and to fill these roles Lean chose his cast very wisely. The venerable Alec Guinness injects an air of gravitas mixed with incredible humor into his role as Prince Feisal, a central figure to the Bedouin tribes. Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif work wonders alongside O'Toole's Lawrence as Auda Abu Tayi and Sherif Ali respectively. Arthur Kennedy shows up as reporter Jackson Bentley, a man interested in Lawrence the warrior. Claude Rains, Jose Ferrer, and Jack Hawkins turn up in critical roles, too.<br /><br />But it's O'Toole's Lawrence who sits at the center of the film, and it's O'Toole whose subsequent career flowed from the promise he showed in this picture. By all accounts, T.E. Lawrence was an incredibly enigmatic, complex individual impervious to definitive character study. Lean does as good a job as any trying to define the man. We see Lawrence as the quintessential Englishman, an Arab warrior, a preening narcissist, a diplomat, a learned scholar, a tyrant, and a man plagued by insecurity and doubts. He is, in other words, an everyman and an extraordinary man with the same strengths and foibles we all share to some degree. The memorable scenes involving O'Toole's depiction of the character would fill a book: He dances through the desert looking at his reflection in a knife blade after donning his Arab accoutrements, poses atop a train after a battle as though reveling in the understanding of his power and accomplishment, and he cowers with the fear of a man broken when the Turks torture him. What impressed me most about the film--a small thing, really--was the absence of a romantic subplot. No woman emerges to cast her charms on our lead character, which is incredible for any film. Then I realized that the love affair is there for all to see, namely the love Lawrence has for the desert and the Arab people.<br /><br />Check out the extras for the film. Four featurettes, a documentary, original newsreel footage, and a few other odds and ends will keep you glued to the television set long after the movie ends. An epic that Hollywood probably couldn't pull off today, "Lawrence of Arabia" is an exceptional piece of cinema every fan of the medium should watch at least once. Actually, subsequent viewings reveal even more of its magic if you can find the time to watch it again. Lean and O'Toole went on to make many other films, but neither ever topped this one.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>One of David Lean's finest films, Lawrence of Arabia finally looks pretty good on DVD. You'll notice I said pretty good not exceptional or excellent or even outstanding. Why is that? Edge enhancement has become an issue with many DVDs. With this transfer it's no exception. There is an excessive amount of halos and a shimmering like effect that you see with edge enhancement. This is distracting for many folks.<p>Sometimes Columbia gets it right and sometimes they get it wrong. There have been a couple of Superbit DVDs that are outstanding and have minimal or no edge enhancement visible. While restoration expert Robert Harris is to be applauded for his efforts in improving this transfer, it appears that a number of short cuts were taken (probably not by Harris although if it was one has to question why). To give this edition of Lawrence its due, this is probably the sharpest, most vivid transfer I've seen of Lawrence and it bests the Laserdisc edition as well. Considering the magic that Robert Harris worked (a decade plus after he helped restore it)with the original material and the nice job of color balancing, adjustments, etc. that was done, it's a pity this isn't closer to perfection.<p>If none of this is valuable to you and you aren't looking to purchase a Superbit Edition but a regular single disc edition, by all means read the review for that item. It's a solid transfer and looks good if you don't notice edge enchancements or issues with how sharp the resolution or how accurate the color might be.<p>No need to recap the plot but I'd like to point out that Peter O'Toole is still stunning in the title role. With a supporting cast consisting of Claude Rains, Jack Hawkins, Omar Shariff, Alec Guiness and others, that's no small feat. Like the role Michael Rennie played in The Day The Earth Stood Still, O'Toole came to be defined to some extent by this role. It didn't limit his abilities as an actor, however, because the studio system didn't exist to exert its constraints on him as an actor. <p>A couple of other minor complaints; 1) Why didn't Columbia do away with the Intermission. Yes, the music is glorius but why not include the music as the only supplement at the end of the disc? This wouldn't have taken any more disc space than the Intermission does now. Since this is broken up over two discs, the intermission is unnecessary. It's much like the roadshow overture; it's not something that most fans of the film are going to sit through every single time. Again, I would have put the three minute overture as an option vs. having it pasted at the front where you have to fast forward through it every single time.<p>With all the extra money spent on this disc would it have hurt Columbia to include a third disc with special features? A documentary on the original restoration would have been nice as would a documentary on T. E. Lawrence (I'm sure I remember that Biography ran one so it would be available to license). If these Superbit editions are going to be treated as the deluxe edition, why not include some deluxe extras? These are minor points to be sure, but if you're going to pony up for another edition of a film you've already purchased, why not get some extra value beyond the enhanced film?<p>For those that are interested there are two other versions of Lawrence avaiable on DVD. The single disc has the entire film with no extras (that I recall), while the double disc edition does feature many extras that are worthwhile and it has a collectable case, booklet, etc. The former runs about $10.00 less than this edition, while the latter is comparable in cost.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ.html">A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ</a><br/><p>&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; is one of the great epics. A film that is captivating in its scope and grandeur. Director David Lean has here his best film. It is a remarkably well-made film with a fantastic screenplay by Robert Bolt and dynamic performances by Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif. But what makes the film a masterpiece aside from the great dramatic elements, is the incredible visual quality. The vistas are breathtaking and it will be a very long time before anyone films the desert like Lean did with this film. It is even more breathtaking a movie to watch when you know this was released in 1962, long before computer graphics were essential to visuals. Everything is REAL, alive and thundering. And whatever beautiful visual side-effects we see in the sand or caused by the heat caught in the background by the lenses, is quite natural too. The action sequences are also great to this day. This film is epic and grand, heroic and exhilarating yet beautifully artistic. And there is of course, the romantic, wonderous musical score by Maurice Jarre. It is one of the great masterpieces of the cinema. A true classic that still stands the test of time. This new DVD edition is fantastic and the making-of documentary is fascinating and very informative. It is a worthy treatment. Here is one of the truly great films.</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>David Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia" was envisioned to be a definitive blockbuster, epic in size, yet thought-provoking, as well (a quality often lacking in other 'big' films of the era). He succeeded brilliantly on both counts, with cinematography that captures both the mystery and harshness of the desert, Maurice Jarre's haunting score, action scenes that are riveting, and performances that are all first-rate, headed by Omar Sharif's charismatic Ali, and, in the title role, Peter O'Toole as the enigmatic title character.<br /><br />Lawrence remains a controversial figure to this day, a man of incredible abilities, yet devastating character flaws that would, in time, destroy both his credibility and his reputation. O'Toole's sensitive interpretation of the man is simply brilliant, balancing a larger-than-life ego and bravado with a confusion of who he really is, and a growing moral corruption that would eventually bring about his downfall.<br /><br />An amazing film, truly David Lean's masterpiece!</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>"Lawrence of Arabia" is a legendary movie. A biopic, that's about 20 minutes shy of 4 hours long and is on The American Film Institute's Top 100 (#5). When talked about, most people mention that this movie (to be truly appreciated) must be seen in a movie theatre. Roger Ebert said "[It is now] on video, where it crouches inside its box like a tall man in a low room." Watching the film and it's imagery, it's clear that a movie theatre would do the best justice to it...But few people will actually have a chance to see this in the theatre. When the movie came out in 1962, it won a slew of Oscars including Best Picture but was almost lost forever. The original negative's were found in crushed and rusting film cans and have since been restored to what it is now. Hard to believe since the picture in this film looks so good, it could have been filmed last year. The movie stars Peter O'Toole as the title character T.E. Lawrence. I'd heard of O'Toole before seeing this movie, but had never seen him in anything. He's an actor like William Hurt or John Malkovich. He has a very peculiar speech pattern that fascinates you the first time you hear it (and sometimes even the 100th time). The movie opens with Lawrence getting into a motorcycle accident and dying. At his funeral, people discuss him...Saying nice things about him and less-than-nice things about him. But no one truly seems to have known him. The movie flashes back and we learn that Lawrence was a soldier in Cairo, who was sent into the Arabian Desert where he would lead a revolt against the Turks. Despite the fact the movie is, essentially, a biopic...It's not big on plot. There is a plot in the film, but there's not a whole lot to write about on the subject. Along the way, Lawrence befriends Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif, who's terrific) and Prince Feisal (Alec Guiness, barely recognizable). And even Auda abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn). Claude Rains (Louie from Casablanca) is also in the film. In my personal opinion, Lawrence of Arabia is, above all, one of the most beautiful films ever made. Its cinematography is almost poetic in the way it pans over the vast desert landscapes. The score of the film is almost ironic. It's an over-the-top heroic score that would seem more suited for a movie like The Mummy Returns. It works here though and makes these scenes even better. The movie is well acted and truly deserves the title of "one of the best films ever made." Whether I'd ever watch it again, however, is a different story. If it played at my local multiplex, I'd definitely go...And it's not a reflection on the movie itself that I wouldn't watch it again, merely it's length. It's easier for me to find time to watch 3, 2-hour movies than it is for me to watch 1, 4-hour movie. It's a great movie, though, and one that people should definitely see. If you haven't seen it, I'd recommend renting it first and then making a decision on whether you should purchase it or not.<br /><br />Grade: A<br /><br />Cinematography: A++</p></br><a href="../users/A27CFNHYZG6WS8.html">A27CFNHYZG6WS8</a><br/><p>'Lawrence of Arabia' is more than just a large-scale desert adventure - it's not David Lean's fault he spawned the detritus of modern cinema in the shape of Spielberg, Lucas and their offspring. <p>Like his best epics, it is a thorough, ironic, viciously satiric look at different types of Englisheness, and at the cynical legacy of colonialism. It is a dismantling of the myth of T. E. Lawrence - any heroic successes are either filmed from a distance, minimised by context or not shown at all; triumph is usually quickly followed by bathos or defeat; we see how the myth is created and exploited, how much the man differs from, and fails to live up to, it. <p>It is a film full of classical irony Lawrence himself might have appreciated - a man who nearly kills himself trying to save a man he must later execute; a man who wants to escape one class-ridden society that would dismiss him as 'illegitimate', only to see his dreams destroyed in a land where class differences are murderous. <p>Lawrence, though coming from an opposite viewpoint, is a close relative of Colonel Nicholson in 'Bridge on the River Kwai', a man whose very English faithfulness to a code turns him into a traitor and murderer. <p>The first, longer part of 'Arabia' is especially magnificent, daring the audience to submit to its pace, to feel the monotonous vastness and unknowability of the desert. By focusing on shadows, the swirls of sand bordering the immovable smoothness of dunes, the phantom introduction of Ali, the supernatural power of dust-storms, Lean captures the spiritual sense inherent to Lawrence, and hostile to the narrow-minded bureaucracy of the Army and Empire; these shots, and the many sequences where huge armies become tiny patterns against the awesome desert geometry, seem closer to abstract art than the pomp of the usual historical epic. <p>So rich and detailed is the first half, that Lean seems to have gotten bored, and the second is a mostly dispiriting sequence of noisy, cluttered crowd scenes that is much closer to Lucas and Spielberg, with barely an interesting, never mind beautiful shot. Of course, this could simply be replicating the growing disillusion of Lawrence himself.</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>David Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia" is one of the few films that legitimately deserves to be called great... It appears on virtually all "ten best" lists and reveals deeper layers of meaning with repeated viewings...<br /><br />Lean, a man devoted to the art, gives "Lawrence of Arabia" its spectacular values... He unifies the sand and the sun to flame out the silver screen... Maurice Jarre's terrific music escorts the appearance and disappearance of the sun below the horizon in the sleepy desert...<br /><br />"Lawrence of Arabia" is a prodigious labor, a masterful mixture of fact and artistry, a masterpiece of intimate moment and spectacular largesse, a film that literally excites the senses... In a visual sense, Lean combines a sure sense of place with an approach to the action that he borrows from an unlikely source--John Ford... Lean turns his vast desert canvas into another Monument Valley, and when his Bedouins ride across it, they are not far removed from Ford's cavalry... In many of the early scenes, the stately gait of the camel's walk gives the film a slower pace, and this is precisely what Lean is trying to achieve... Lean even manages to surpass Ford with his understanding of the relationship between his characters and the landscape; how the desert changes those who go into it...<br /><br />The film is the story of a solitary adventurer who always knew he was different, but in Arabia he discovers that his proportions are heroic... Perhaps this is the secret of Lawrence of the legends -- that at the bottom of all the violent action is a protagonist about whom one cares... A puzzling personality whom one glimpses but never fully understands... Throuhout the picture one has a sense of a man discovering his own unique dimensions...<br /><br />Lawrence's mission, largely his own creation, is to unite the feuding Bedouin tribes under the leadership of Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness), and to keep the British politicians, as personified by Mr. Dryden (Claude Rains), from putting the Arabs under their colonial thumb after World War I is over... It is accomplished through a semi-episodic series of battles and raids where Lawrence is sometimes accompanied by Ali (Omar Sharif) and Sheik Auda (Anthony Quinn), and equally difficult bureaucratic struggles he faces with Gen. Allenby (Jack Hawkins).<br /><br />All the conventional elements of the genre are at peaks of excellence here: The stretch desert with its white golden sands; peril, anywhere and everywhere; danger-for Lawrence of Arabia is a film about guerrilla warfare; prowess-Lawrence crosses Sinai on foot; physical torture-Lawrence in the hands of the Turkish bey; impossible mission- Lawrence takes the seaport of Jordan from behind; ruthlessness-Lawrence shouting 'take no prisoners' leading his men to put to death a Turkish column...<br /><br />Every component is here, everything one needs for a great adventure film, many spectacular sequences, each of them so perfect: Lean cuts to the sun again and again, turning it into a character; the scene in Feisal's tent when Lawrence first talks with the king; Lawrence striding on top of a captured train, parading before rows of cheering Arabs; the scene between Lawrence and Ferrer illuminating Lawrence's strange perversity, a mixture of masochism and repressed homosexuality; the scene when a Beduin prince appears on his camel, an exceedingly long take in which a strange figure is first resolved out of waves of heat and then, as he approaches, becomes a frightening threat to Lawrence's escort at the desert well...<br /><br />The photography, the script and the acting are so superb that "Lawrence of Arabia" becomes a lavish epic winner of 7 Academy Awards for Best Picture, Directing, Color, Cinematography, Sound, Muscial Score and Film Editing...</p></br><a href="../users/A1OYW08VVPMP3Q.html">A1OYW08VVPMP3Q</a><br/><p>A sweeping look at a man who was made by the Great War.<br /><br />Lawrence, a scholar and archeologist prior to the war (something the movie seems to miss) was sent by the British to assist the Arabs who were at that time revolting against their Ottoman masters. The British hoped that an Arab revolt would draw resources away from the Egyptian frontier and from Mesopotamia, allowing the allies to invade the Turkish homeland.<br /><br />Lawrence, working with Prince Faisal, did manage to organize the Arabs after a fashion to attack the Turks but the Arabs were using the British as much as the British were using the Arabs. The difference was that the British had much more far-reaching goals for the region.<br /><br />The movie is a great action film but not necessarily great history. But it is a winderful movie to sit down and watch. Lawrence was successful because he took up the Arab cause as his own. His exploits also served Allied propaganda at a time when everything was stalled on the Western Front.<br /><br />As an aside, Lawrence could not live with being the hero portrayed by the Allies. He tried to get away from the person everyone thought he was.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>It is difficult to describe one of the greatest films of all time. This film may even be the greatest film of all time. Such sweeping statements are difficult to defend because opinions are exactly that. Yet, this movie has much going for it that make it a must for any greatest films list, and makes the top of mine.<br /><br />Let us begin with the peripherals. At a time when sets were common, this movie was filmed entirely on location. The desert scenes are all real. I believe the interiors were all real buildings, though I can not verify that. The music, most especially the theme, is unbelievable. The soaring violins are well matched to the expansive desert vistas, stretching away into infinity. The Arabian deserts are as immense as the American west. Also important were the costumes, which were highly detailed and apparently authentic. Each and every aspect of this movie was so exceedingly well executed that it approaches perfection. In one of the DVD extras Peter O'Toole mentions that he was expecting to be filming this movie for five months, and instead ended up filming it for two years and three months, one indication of the care and complexity required to create this film.<br /><br />If you have yet to buy this movie, then please do two things. First, if at all possible for your region, buy the two-disk DVD with the marvelous extras. The black and white documentaries are short but interesting. The interviews provide insight into those involved with the film. Second, buy the biggest television set you possibly can, and be sure you watch this movie in wide screen format. You miss too much with full screen. In fact, the optimal way to watch this movie is to have a surround sound system and an HDTV set up for wide screen format.<br /><br />The movie itself is a classic of classics, the story of an English map maker in service to his country. Bored by what he is doing, he wants to see some action. Soon he does, but the action changes him. The movie is about how T. E. Lawrence grows from an idealistic young man to a battle hardened man who discovers that he likes killing, and yet is repulsed by it. The movie also proclaims that T. E. Lawrence was one of the principals involved in Arab independence and the movie is about some of the seminal moments in the uniting of many Arab tribes. The movie also provides as much information about Lawrence's psychology as it does about his actions, because his psychology, from being able to put out a match with his bare fingers to calling for the elimination of a fleeing column of Turkish troops with the taking of no prisoners, provides insights into the complex psyche of the person of T. E. Lawrence.<br /><br />The battles are exquisitely executed. The fights are extremely well choreographed, and I admire the stamina and dedication of the hundreds of people involved in the creation of this movie as they created this movie in desert temperatures. Given the care that is taken with safety in modern films, I believe this movie would be extremely difficult to film in the same way today.<br /><br />Ultimately, the art, the story, the locations, the music, the script, the costumes and the action all come together to create an incredibly compelling and realistic story of T. E. Lawrence. This movie is a must-have for a collector of great films.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>Of all the movies that really don't need another review, this one probably heads the list. However since 'Lawrence of Arabia' is one of my all-time top ten films I wanted to add my two cents anyway.<br /><br />Seldom in cinematic history has there ever been so grand a tale told as the story of T. E. Lawrence and his miraculous accomplishments in the deserts of Arabia. A man of truly mythic proportions whose interior vision was so powerful it forever changed the course of world politics. By an act of pure, concentrated willpower ("Nothing is written unless I write it") Lawrence defied all the odds and experts, uniting the ever-feuding semitic tribes of the Middle East under one flag in a battle for Arab independence. This was a daring project to commit to film and it paid of, becoming one of the most honored and studied films of all-time.<br /><br />Columbia pulled out all the stops in bringing this true life adventure to the screen. Nothing but the best was required. Director David Lean, complimented by one of the most skilled casts ever assembled; Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Claude Rains, Arthur Kennedy, Jack Hawkins and Jose Ferrer brought the story to life as nobody else could. Coupled with Maurice Jarre's epic soundtrack, we have been graced with as perfect a film as you will ever see.</p></br><a href="../users/APZ9MBMUKD2W.html">APZ9MBMUKD2W</a><br/><p>A great film that shows the world one of the real odd birds that the British Military puts out every once in a while. Men like Gordan, Wingate & Clive who you don't really know where to place them. But none the less they are very valuable men to have around in a tight place. This film takes the story of Lawrence as he goes from a raw junior Officer to Desert Legend. While it could of been very easy to make it one of those Ripping Good storys about one of the lads winning the war by themself in Arabia. The story resists this impluse and so makes itself a legend in itself. I can not praise this film too highly!</p></br><a href="../users/APP5MBH2BSX6I.html">APP5MBH2BSX6I</a><br/><p>First let me laud the other reviewers who have shared such historical detail with us on this page.  They help flesh out the famous story of the blond Briton who made his mark on history among the dark men of the desert.  I have nothing to add to their comments in this regard; at age 45 I have just seen the film for the first time, having been recently inspired by the NY Times list of "1000 best movies ever made" to see many of The Great Films I've Never Seen.<br /><br />From the perspective of a newcomer, therefore, I have to say I'm astonished at how perfect this massive epic is.  Two years in the making, on a nearly unheard-of scale at the time, bogged down by the many problems of shooting on location in the actual deserts of the Middle East, "Lawrence of Arabia" was such an ordeal that Peter O'Toole turned down the lead in "Dr. Zhivago," David Lean's next epic, simply because he was so wrung out from playing T.E. Lawrence that he couldn't imagine a similar experience for quite some time.  Sure enough, they never worked together again.  Even with all of the problems, this film is simply phenomenal in every way.<br /><br />NY Times reviewer Bosley Crowther, writing in 1962, seemed flummoxed with the fact that Lean chose to leave Lawrence an enigmatic character.  It was a simpler time when this movie was made and released, and Crowther seems to have wanted firm answers to the man's character and his motives.  As the other reviewers here make clear, that's just not the point.  Lawrence was, and is, the embodiment of the phrase Winston Churchill used in reference to Russia, "a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma."  Time has borne out that Lean was absolutely right to leave it that way, rather than guessing at the man's motivations and hidden life.  A larger than life character is almost always ruined when dissected.<br /><br />T.E. Lawrence came to be known as being as big a character as the desert itself, and Lean's epic drives this point home.  On the day after viewing, one is left with two thoughts especially:  The desert is vast and unforgiving, and Lawrence was equally immovable and probably a manic depressive.  Beyond that, the amazingly rich photography, the loving attention to detail, the perfectly pitched pace of the story and the multiple relationships among the characters, and even Alec Guinness in "brownface" as Prince Faisel, combine to create an incredible work of art that will never grow old.  My only nitpick would be that in one of Guinness's scenes a line had to be changed after principal filming, so that his lips move but his voice says something different.  In a nearly-four-hour film, that one nitpick is so insignificant that I feel retentive even mentioning it.<br /><br />At once an epic on a grand scale, an intimate character portrait that leaves us with tantalizing questions, a historical record, and a war film with an anti-war (or at least war-weary) ending, "Lawrence of Arabia" is unique and cherished, for good reason.  It may have taken me 45 years to see this masterpiece, but it won't take another 45 to see it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Lawrence of Arabia (David Lean, 1962)<br /><br />There has been a good deal of debate recently among bloggers and critics of my generation and that below me-- the new critics, as it were-- about the "old" critics' 100-best lists and the rather heavy concentration in them of "old" movies (for the purposes of this argument, we'll define "old" as "made before 1970"-- at least for the movies), and that when new movies do make the list, they are, by and large, foreign films. When you expand to critics' thousand-best lists, where one might think to find a good deal more new films, the trend actually gets more pronounced. The basis of the argument is that new movies deserve just as much respect as old ones. There's certainly some validity to this point; good movies are made every year. However, I don't think simple nostalgia is the sole basis for this seeming prejudice; let's face it, the film industry in the English-speaking world has changed dramatically in the past forty years. Case in point: try to imagine Columbia, or any other major Hollywood studio, releasing, or even greenlighting, David Lean's magnificent Lawrence of Arabia today-- a war film that comes in just shy of four hours, with as much (if not more) emphasis on the development of two of its main characters as there is actual action. I'm pretty sure any studio exec seeing this script on his desk today would have a cow, or at least a goat. I read an amusing article by Ken Russell today where he calls this mindset the butt factor-- how long a person's butt can stay in a cinema seat before it goes numb-- and he notes that where Hollywood is concerned, the butt factor is about two hours. He implies, by linking this to some of his older films (1969's Women in Love and 1971's The Devils-- both of which, it should be noted, are regular entrants on those thousand-best lists), that the butt factor had been two hours in Hollywood studios for quite some time now. Ah, but such was not the case, thank heaven, in 1962.<br /><br />To film his life of T. E. Lawrence, David Lean rounded up a stable of well-known, well-loved actors (including Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Claude Rains, and Jose Ferrer, among many others), and then set atop them two relative unknowns: Peter O'Toole, in his first big-screen appearance, and Egyptian actor Omar Sharif, none of whose films had, at the time, been released in America or England. A surprising move, perhaps, and I have little doubt there was carping at the studio over using two unknowns in the top slots of what was to be a lavish, expensive effort. Lean knew what he was doing, though, as history has borne out; O'Toole, nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for this film, snagged his seventh Oscar nomination (all seven, interestingly, have been for Best Actor) in 2006, while Sharif, also Oscar-nominated for his role here, has become a legend both on the screen and at the card table. Between them, the movie's principal actors account for thirty-two Oscar nominations over the years, with four wins; not bad, not bad at all. The movie itself won only seven of the ten Oscars for which it was nominated, with both O'Toole and Sharif missing out (losing to Gregory Peck and Ed Begley, respectively). Still, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Picture, not a bad haul.<br /><br />Lawrence of Arabia is one of those movies where you don't have to get it to get it. You don't have to notice that almost all the action in the film goes from left to right for your subconscious to figure it out and attach meaning to it. You don't have to notice the incredible cinematography, for which at least one custom lens was developed. All you have to do is sit back and watch two great actors at work. O'Toole's Lawrence may not have won the Oscar, but AFI called his Lawrence the finest screen performance of all time; I'm not sure I'd go quite that far, but to say it's impressive would be greatly understating the case. Equally impressive is Sharif's Ali, but the interplay between them is more than the sum of its parts. Lean and screenwriters Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson never let the viewer assume that the friendship between Lawrence and Ali is on firm ground, even when one is risking his life for the other; both are complex characters, and their relationship reflects all the pressures, both internal and external, on each of them.<br /><br />That's not the only reason to watch this movie, of course. It is expertly paced; the crossing of the Nefud, which takes up the bulk of the second quarter of the film, flies by. Who knew that a bunch of guys on camels picking their way over rocks could be compelling? David Lean did, I guess, and we should thank him for giving us as much of it as he did.<br /><br />An amazing, beautiful piece of work that must be seen to be believed. **** ?</p></br><a href="../users/AEMZRE6QYVQBS.html">AEMZRE6QYVQBS</a><br/><p>The haunting soundtrack of this 1962 film presentation of one of the twentieth century's most ambiguous heroes is not the only thing that leaves one wondering how such artistry could flourish among the certainties of that historical moment.<br /><br />If it is impossible to know who and what T.E. Lawrence really was, this film deftly refuses to make everything clear.<br /><br />That an English soldier immersed in 'Arabia' (the Hejaz, mostly) could successfully skirt 'blasphemous conceit' and still pull off a decisive role in the Arab uprising against the imperium that was then abbreviated as 'the Turk' is improbable at best. That this stunning wide-screen retelling of his story-cum-history could remain compelling forty years later at a time when few viewers could endure its plodding pace is a tribute to its genius.<br /><br />'Nothing is written', Lawrence insists to Arab tribal leaders who believe everything is written. He seems to remake possibility by sheer force of eerie will. Lawrence comes across as the quintessential English Impatient, seeing more than Arab realists and out-of-touch colonialists could imagine.<br /><br />In the end, the Turk did go home and Arabia was set free to be re-enslaved by men of a different accent and set of blood loyalties.<br /><br />Who knows who really won the Levant campaign? So many claimed to have done so. Sixty years later, it still isn't clear.<br /><br />But the consideration of that question is more entertainingly carried out with the stunning imagery of this film on one's shelf. Its widescreen sequences of men on camels in almost borderless desert stretches the imagination.<br /><br />The very strangeness of Lawrence's odyssey is painted the better for the novelty of what writers, directors, and camera operators managed to pull off in a year when the world lurched towards nuclear confrontation and the legacy of one very odd Englishmen had still not been settled.<br /><br />See the movie.

The wonder Spielberg saw in this film is evident in his own filmography; from the desert scapes in his Indiana Jones films to the intimacy of Schindler's List.<p>Fantastic performances by a young Peter O'Toole, Alec Guinness and the rest of the cast bring the story to vivid life. In particular, O'Toole becomes Lawrence. It's clear the actors believed in their characters, and in the movie.<p>Filled with classic moments that still to this day inspire awe and power in its audiences, such as the slow approach by stranger on horseback to the well Lawrence and his companion drink from, this film is fantastic on all levels.

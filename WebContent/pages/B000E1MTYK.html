He's mastered the art of the British upper-crust romantic comedy, but anxious fans wondered how that would translate to Hogwarts, dragons, and the return of Lord Voldemort?<br /><br />Fortunately for all, Newell was up to the challenge and has given us one of the most visually stunning movies this side of Peter Jackson.<br /><br />You may have heard a slight rumor or the occasional hint that this movie does not treat J.K. Rowling's mammoth book as a shooting script.  This is true, and this was obviously the correct decision -- not even the most die-hard fan would sit still for the eight-hour movie that would have entailed.  It's not surprising to find fans frustrated with this movie because their favorite scenes (whether the dragon fight, or the big dance, or Harry's sojourn underwater, or Hagrid's romantic efforts) handled with a bit more economy than the book.<br /><br />But if you look at the movie for what it is, then you have to give it a rave review.  From the Triwizard Tournament to Harry's fight with the dragon to Lord Voldemort's bilious return, this movie looks great and captures the essence of J.K. Rowling's wonderful story.  I'll leave it to others to summarize the plot, but suffice to say that Harry, Ron and Hermione have grown, as have their dangers and concerns.  This is easily the most grown-up movie so far, and be warned if you have younger kiddies who may have liked the first couple of movies.  Dark stuff lies ahead.<br /><br />One scene stands out as one of the best extended special effects shots ever -- Harry's extended fight with the dragon is sure to turn up annually in those special effects montages that they fire off in the Academy Awards show just when everyone is getting ready to doze off.  Kudos all around!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>The Harry Potter film franchise takes off with another wizardly tale of growing up at Hogwarts with all of its interpersonal banter and dark underpinnings.<br /><br />Watching the young actors age on the screen is probably becoming one of the more satisfying things for me. It makes it seem more "real" even though this is just a fantastic fantasy.<br /><br />Coming back to the wizard school this time, we see that Ron, Hermione and Harry have hit their growth (and hormone) spurts. Dancing, love, friendship, and danger are now forever linked as we're introduced to the Goblet of Fire TriWizard competition. Normally set as a triad competition (between three individuals of different schools) this time there will be four contestants, obviously including Harry. Angst and anger are the melange of the day as Harry has to deal with his lack of knowledge about the competition and grapple with his growing affection for girls his own age. Oh yes, and he's still be chased by the evil Lord Voldemort (the wizard responsible for his parents' death and the unusual scar forever emblazoned on Harry's forehead).<br /><br />Harry's not old enough to compete in the competition and his fellow Hogwartians aren't happy with the fact that Harry seems to be outgrowing his own shoes. Is he too cocky? Harry never entered the competition and doesn't know how his name got picked but his fellow classmates don't believe him.<br /><br />As the Goblet of Fire contest continues, we see Harry battling dragons, saving one friend but unable to rescue another, and then meeting face-to-face with true evil.<br /><br />Perhaps it's the dark qualities of these latest Potter films that drags me in, or perhaps I'm just a fan of the genre (junky?), but whatever it is, I find the dangers and limited successes of Harry and his friends comforting and realistic (not overly done with a "Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes" attitude). This one's rated PG-13, too, so keep an eye on the kiddies.<br /><br />Like the Prizoner of Azkaban, this one has very dark over and undertones. And clocking in at two-and-a-half hours, it's one of the longer in the series but well worth the sitting time.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>This is the Potter movie that suffers the most from the transition from book to movie. It is the fattest book, but the movie is approximately the same length as the others, so even more is left out than usual. Having said that, it is still a good movie, a very good movie. It's just a frustration to the fans of the books, but it's marvelous for those who have never read them.<br /><br />Unlike the first three movies, we do not start with the Dursleys. Harry is visiting at the Burrow (Weasley's place), and has a dream about Voldemort, Wormtail, and someone who is clearly a younger follower of Voldemort whom Harry does not recognize. When he wakes up, it is to Hermione shaking him awake so they can get ready for their trip to the Quidditch World Cup. This is the first we learn there is a Quidditch World Cup, and that there are other schools of magic besides Hogwarts. There is Durmstrang (quite Prussian in style) and there is Beaubatons (decidedly French).<br /><br />But we don't get to see the World Cup at all, just the opening ceremonies that glorify the Bulgarian seeker, Viktor Krum. Next thing you know it is over, and suddenly the grounds are aflame through the marching violence of the Death Eaters. (Readers of the book know just how very much more there is to this.) The same young man who was in Harry's dream serving Voldemort conjures the Dark Mark into the sky. (No Winky; no house elves at all in this episode.)<br /><br />We no sooner get to Hogwarts than the Beaubatons carriage and the Durmstrang sailing ship appear, apparently on the first day of school. There are only girls (not a word about veela) in the Beaubatons contingent, and only boys in the Durmstrang group. Including, of course, Viktor Krum.<br /><br />Rita Skeeter is there, annoying as ever, but nothing is ever said about her being an unregistered anamagus. She just delivers her lies and half-truths to the Daily Prophet and infuriates Harry and Hermione, whom she insists on linking romantically. Hermione's beautiful revenge is altogether missing, which is a great pity.<br /><br />But we do have the Yule Ball, and Ron's ghastly antique dress robes, and Padme and Parvati Patil, and all the jealousies mentioned in the book. They managed to get all that in, no matter what else was left out. (Grrrrrr!)<br /><br />And of course we have the Triwizard Tournament. That story is told rather like the way it was in the book, although the problems encountered in the maze are way over-simplified. No blast-end skrewts, no Sphinx, mostly just weird vegetable matter and the imperious curse on Krum. And of course the trophy cup is a port key. But I won't spoil the rest. The story is basically the same from here out.<br /><br />So try not to mourn for the missing parts, and enjoy the movie. It does have complexity, in spite of all that cutting, and as a movie, it's pretty darn good.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Movie will start automatically at 2 minutes, 31 sec. if you have not chosen in option in the menu.<br /> Running Time: 2 hours, 36 mins.

Prisoner of Azkaban, year 3 is where the story gets darker and more realistic. Prisoner of Azkaban had a ground hog day touch to it. I found that Harry Potter has stopped being a kiddy adventure from year 3 onwards in the sense that it has got more adultish and realistic. This is due to the fact that the characters are growing up allowing them for more mature and logical actions . Chris Columbus made the 1 and 2 movies very cheerful in tone, bright and just apt for the kiddies. The story at that time (year1 and 2) had the gang as little kiddies (which is what they were back then). Azkaban changed the trend. And in here Mike Newell (from  Four Weddings and a funeral fame) creates a realistic movie in so far as the stunts and violence goes. Harry suffers bruises, people die ,and real death looms. This in part also because the story is writtent that way and also because the director chooses to emphasize that the movie and adventure is entering a darker tone. The cinematographys uses a dark charcoalish shade informing us of the impeding doom to come. The cinematography is as gothic, operatic and grand in scale as Azkaban was. The Yule ball is a nice interlude from the tri-wizard tournament and is reminescent of high school proms. Lovely book and a lovely movie. The complaint that movie is not true to the book is utterly stupid as you cannot faithfully translate a 700 odd page book into a movie. So you compress, and these guys have got it right. They compressed the right bits. At the end the 700 pg book has to work as a piece of film seen in over 2.5 hrs. And it works just right.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>The earlier Harry Potter films have moments of quiet whimsy, where J.K. Rowling's universe is fleshed out.  This 4th installment, the Goblet of Fire, is so jam-packed that there is no time for anything that doesn't service one of the 2 main plots.  The first plotis about the Triwizard Tournament - a deadly competition to determine the greatest of the three magical schools: the British co-ed Hogwarts, the Bulgarian male-only Durmstrang, and the French all-girls school Beauxbaton.  This plot contains all the action of the film, and includes some dramatic special-effects sequences, including a battle with a dragon and a wand-weilding climactic battle.  The second plot contains the character-development aspects of the film: associated with the Triwizard Tournament is a Grand Ball, and our heroes must find dates and deal with puberty-induced angst.  Especially effective in this part of the film is Emma Watson's portrayal of nerdish Hermione.  Instead of being only the Mr. Spock-like logician to Ron and Harry, she gets to show some real emotion when Harry and Ron treat her like one of the guys, rather than see her as a date prospect for the ball.<br /><br />It is well that the filmmakers focussed on these two plots, as Rowling's book is 600+ pages.  Obviously, much of the detail of the book is missing.  For example, we only see one class during the entire year, and that is to introduce the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, who plays a pivotal role in the story.  We see not a single Potions class with Prof. Snape.  We don't even see Prof. Sprout (Herbology), a Quidditch match, a House Elf, or Nearly-Headless Nick.  Even so, newcomers to the series are likely to be scratching their heads in parts - for example, Harry contacts Sirius Black but no mention is made in the film who he is (he's Harry's godfather).<br /><br />That's not to say that the film isn't enjoyable or rich in detail.  If it takes a cavalier attitude in trimming all but the essentials from the two main plotlines, it must do so in order to keep the movie focussed.  At 2.5 hours, it's none too short, but the time flies by because the performances are very good and the action sequences last just long enough (but not too long!)<br /><br />This bare-bones DVD contains absolutely no extras - not even the audio commentary, not even the film's trailer.  I would recommend that anyone with even the remotest interest in the series should go with the special-edition 2-disc set instead (especially since it's the same price, at least it was when I wrote this review).</p></br><a href="../users/AAEP8YFERQ8FC.html">AAEP8YFERQ8FC</a><br/><p>Mike Newell takes the helm of the Harry Potter franchise, directing the fourth film "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" based on the hefty novel of the same name by J.K. Rowling. I think it's one of the better adaptions, in terms of flow of plot, even if it omits and augments sizable elements of the book.<br /><br />It's Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe's) fourth year at Hogwarts, and what a special year it is. Over the summer, Harry got to see the Quidditch world cup, and during the school year, he gets to compete in the Triwizard Tournament. The only problem is, he isn't actually supposed to be in it. It is only for students over 17, and only for three champions to compete in. Harry is 14, and is the fourth champion. Has someone planted his name? Has the Goblet of Fire, the magical artifact that makes such decisions, made a mistake? The Triwizard Tournament is very dangerous, perhaps someone wants to see him died. With new faces, a strange new teacher and an upcoming school dance, it turns out to be a very hectic year, and one that will change the lives of all concerned forever.<br /><br />If you've read the book, you'll notice that a lot of side plots have been cut out of the film. We don't see the Dursley family at all, nor do we see the Creeveys. Dobby, Winky and the kitchen of house elves are completely absent, and their actions important to the plot given to other characters. Sirius Black, apart from a small scene, is missing too. We don't even get to see any Veelas! Still, I didn't find it a major point. It keeps the plot pacy and the film shorter, and you still can follow everything, even if you haven't read the book, which can't be said about all of these films. However, I really would have liked to have seen more of the Quidditch World Cup, the scenes from which were way too quick and cut up. What is with modern filmmakers avoiding slow paced beginnings? Annoys me a lot, that particular trend.<br /><br />All the kids growing up, which has always been interesting to watch. The school dance scenes are nicely done, and there's plenty of awkwardness and embarassment between the sexes, a little exaggerated, but that just adds to the color and humour of the scenes. It A few new faces in the cast, including David Tennant, the man who has just recently become the 10th Doctor Who, as Barty Crouch Jr. British character actor Mark Williams once again plays Mr Weasley. It's interesting, because here we get to see him play angry, furious in fact, something I've never seen him do terribly often, and I'm a fan of his. It's a far cry from campy menswear salesman of "The Fast Show" and the rough and tumble Olaf Petersen of "Red Dwarf". Also, check out the band that plays in the school dance. It features Jarvis Cocker of Britpop band Pulp, plus two members of Radiohead (Johnny Greenwood and Phil Selway). Don't really get to see them much though.<br /><br />The special effects were pretty standard fare. I mean, they're detail, but there's no giant leaps, CG seems more an institution rather than an innovation here. Did they have a lower budget or something? Even the DVD seems a little more cheaply, it terms of presentation.<br /><br />Still special features, like always, are many and varied, though the way they're displayed is a little more subdued and static than the last couple of Harry Potter DVD volumes. There's about 9 minutes worth of deleted scenes. Rather than being put in a menu to choose from, they are all stuck together as one long montage, which I found a little bit annoying. A couple of them are worth a mention. There a performance Hogwarts School Song by the school (whose lyrics you can find in Rowling's first Harry Potter book), and a full song by the Wyrd Sisters band. There's the featurette "Preparing for the Yule Ball", a behind the scenes look at the school dance scenes.There's the 30 minute "Conversations With The Cast" hosted by Richard Curtis, which features a lengthy interview with Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watston. It also features questions by fans who won a competition to meet the cast. There's "Reflections on the Fourth Film", a featurette which shows the cast at work and at play. There's a behind the scenes featurette for each of the tri-wizard tasks, which show us interviews with the ever hard working CG/SFX guys, plus a little bit from the cast. There's a "Meet the Champions" feature, with interviews and plenty of behind the scenes banter and fly on the wall antics with the actors who play the Triwizard Champions. There's a featurette on Voldemort, and there's the original theatrical trailer too.<br /><br />As in all the other DVDs, there are the games, this time based on the tasks of the Triwizard Tournament. For the most part I found these to be most frustrating. They were the sort of games where you have to press your remote at exactly the right time and exactly the right way, games that don't give you too many times to make mistakes. It's more about remembering a sequence than fun. The maze was the best of them, a lot like an RPG video game, complete with computer animated characters. You can choose your school and cast spells on the nasty creatures within, plus you can take your time. It was pretty atmospheric for a bonus feature, and features things from the maze mentioned in the book but not in the film (like the mysterious golden mist). If you manage to get through those games, you can have a run through Voldemort's graveyard, which is a reasonable mini-game.<br /><br />It's worth a look, but I'd check out the previous titles in the series first, be they books or DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A34VV92TSLC37R.html">A34VV92TSLC37R</a><br/><p>After finishing the novel, I was extremely excited to see the film version of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.  I was very happy with the result as I left the theater.  There was just so much that happened in the book that could not be fit into a movie that wasn't 3 hours plus long.  The movie is 2 and a half hours long as it is, and that is with it missing a lot of stuff that happens in the novel.<br /><br />The biggest missing pieces is the presence of the house-elves.  Winky and Dobby play an extremely important role in the novel, yet they do not appear at all in the film.  In fact, the group that Hermione creates, S.P.E.W., is never mentioned in the film, either.  I personally really enjoy the presence of house-elves in the novels, although I could see how some people find them annoying.  It just seems like there could have been a middle ground, and then they wouldn't have to be written completely out of the movie.<br /><br />I guess the down side to trying to make movies out of a book like Goblet of Fire or Lord of the Rings is that so many HUGE things happen, that it is really tough to develop any characters other than the main, ultra-important hero/villain/sidekicks.  Specifically, the absence of any story whatsoever about Fred and George is a little disappointing.  Their constant disobedience and troublemaking in the novels is a welcome aside from the foreboding nature of the rest of the novel, and I think the twins are also a little underutilized in the movie, and they are turned into that classic movie-twin cliche of whenever they are onscreen, they are basically just there to say something together (like all twins do all the time).  Since this film focuses more on the big picture of Harry vs. Voldemort, the characters of Draco and Snape are also pretty much absent for most of the film.  I think Snape only has four or five speaking scenes, and you just don't get the vibe of hatred and enmity between Harry and Snape that you get from the novels.  Draco is also limited to very few lines.  His most important scene is probaby my favorite scene from any of the books so far, and that is when Mad-Eye Moody turns him into a ferret, thankfully that scene is in the film in its entirety.  In the book, though, Draco was there during almost every important scene that involved Hogwart's.  He made Harry's life miserable during the tournament, and the film doesn't really give you that impression at all.  The only bad thing that comes from Harry's entrance into the tournament is a fight with Ron, that is drastically cut short also.<br /><br />So I guess I've only said critical things so far, but I gave it four stars, so I better back myself up.  The visuals in this film are absolutely amazing.  Reading the books, you just can't help but think "man, I can't wait to see that dragon on the big screen," and the dragon scene is amazing, though the filmmakers did take quite a few liberties with it to draw it out a little more and make it a little more "blockbuster action sequence" than the book gave us.  Both of the other schools  that compete in the tournament look great.  I thought the filmmakers were spot on with their representation of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes finally gets to really appear, and it was amazing.  I don't think that there was a better choice out there for Lord Voldemort.  That's why I was a little disappointed that his speech in the graveyard didn't go as long as it did in the book, but what we do get from him is amazing, and I can't wait for more.  I think if I was 10 years old, and I saw this movie, I would have nightmares for a while.  Voldemort is that creepy.  Everything that I hoped for.<br /><br />Something also needs to be said for Daniel Radcliffe.  I think he's done a great job, but I also feel a little bad for him.  I feel bad because I think he really is a good actor, but he will always be known as Harry Potter, and it will be really tough to watch him act in another role and be convincing.  But I'm glad that Harry's character is in as good of hands as it is with Radcliffe.<br /><br />Overall, the film was great.  Yeah, a lot of stuff wasn't included that I would have liked, but overall, the studio is out to make money off of these movies, and it's tough to market a movie that is over 3 hours long.  Although I hope that they go at least 3 hours with Order of the Phoenix.  Harry Potter fans are die hard enough, that we will sit through any length of movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M5FI4CB6VUXF.html">A2M5FI4CB6VUXF</a><br/><p>Cuaron destroyed the movie Prisoner of Azkaban to the point that it held little if any real resemblance to the book from which it was adapted. Goblet of Fire, in the hands of a REAL director, luckily returns to many of the things that make the series so grand. You have plenty of substance. You have storyline and plot that really moved this series along about as well as the book does. The problem with part four is that it DOESN'T really serve much purpose in the series. It merely foreshadows what will come.... and serves to show that Voldemort is evil. We already KNEW That!<br /><br />But as movies go, it's a great adaptation. The only problem I had with it was a similar problem I had with part three.... Too much cutting of important information. The usual Potter MOVIE fan is going to be confused as to how Harry makes it to Hogsmeade village in future parts without knowing that, at the end of book 3, a certain character signs his permission slip, thereby granting him said permission. This is just one of the glaring deletions that are going to make the movies really hard to follow...<br /><br />I also missed Dobby and S.P.E.W.<br /><br />I understand why they were deleted, but so much more could have been done.<br /><br />Note to future directors. Don't be afraid to make the film 3 hours. Many obsessed fans such as myself won't mind spending the extra time with our beloved Harry Potter!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>I spent the equivalent of a full day's waking-hours in front of my big screen TV this past winter break with just the 2 sets of the four Harry Potter movies and the three Lord of the Rings movies. I am NOT a couch potato. I am NOT a couch potato. I am NOT a couch potato.<br /><br />Well, at least it was time well spent. Finally...some movies that really make the grade. I've been hard-pressed to find a good 5-star movie that I haven't seen. And here I've had these two sets of films that have been out there all this time that that for whatever reason I've had an aversion to. Silly me.<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire were all at minimum very good. Certainly Socerer's Stone, Chamber and Goblet of Fire are as 5-star as it gets. Azkaban was relatively slow compared to the others, but look at the footsteps that it had to follow in.<br /><br />The list of A-list actors giving A-list performances goes on....You have Richard Harris (GRHS) who was flawlessly and un-noticably (no disrespect intended) replaced by Michael Gambon; Miranda Richardson, Gary Oldman, there's Alan Rickman doing his best Jeremy Irons imitation, Ralph Fiennes, John Hurt, Shirley Henderson, John Cleese and of course Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. I know I'm forgetting more, but you get the idea.<br /><br />Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber were brilliantly led by the direction of Veteran Chris Columbus (Home Alone and tons more). And the cast of these films?...How often do three unknowns (Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley) walk into overnight stardom? Not very. But these three sure did. And it's well deserved. Their characters are well acted and believable; not bad for a bunch of preteens in their debuts.<br /><br />Azkaban was really good and certainly an integral part of the Harry Potter progression of stories. But Azkaban was the first hand-off of the director baton from Columbus to the short resumed, mostly-foreign-film-guy Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n. Columbus still had oversight as a producer, so perhaps Cuar&oacute;n felt intimidated by Columbus' brilliance in Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber...or perhaps Cuar&oacute;n just held back from doing his own thing. Be that as it may, the change in "direction" really shone through. And Cuar&oacute;n was gone for Goblet.<br /><br />Goblet comes in with three changes in direction: 1) The director change from Cuar&oacute;n back to another vet in Mike Newell, 2) The exit of Columbus oversight, and 3) A shift from...shall we say...a more famlyish Harry Potter to a more dark Harry Potter (the way it was intended!). And this did not go un-noticed by the MPAA.<br /><br />It's must be tough to make a PG movie these days; it's hard to believe that the MPAA took the Potter series from a PG rating to a PG-13 rating for Goblet. Kids 13 and under can see uglier violence and hear more profanity at school recess and at the local playground than they do in Goblet...better start a rating system for playgrounds! How is it that a movie like Goblet without a curse-word or graphic act of violence (by today's standards anyway) gets thrown into the same category as, for example, S.W.A.T. (2003) that does indeed not only have the F-word, but strong violence and sex? Ludicrous. But I won't get started on how unfair the MPAA is and how neurotically insane the pressure is from certain groups on the MPAA to "protect" our youth.<br /><br />I will indeed finish by saying that the first four of the Harry Potter releases combined have grossed close to $2,000,000,000 (that's a TWO BILLION dollars) because they're excellent movies that kids can watch too. And Goblet actually did better at the box office than Azkaban. So stick that in your pipe and smoke it, MPAA.<br /><br />If you somehow missed these movies as I did for some crazy reason, I hope that my long-winded review has encouraged you to add them to your cart. As for Lord of the Rings...well that's another review entirely, of course.<br /><br />I can't wait for the upcoming continuation of the Harry Potter series with Order of the Phoenix in 2007 and Half-Blood Prince in 2008. I am NOT a couch potato.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>The nightmares are getting worse and the scar is burning pictures of the dark lord in the mind of Harry Potter. Not even going back to Hogwarts, The Quidditch World Cup or even his huge crush of Ravenclaw seeker Cho Chang can keep these dark images away. Now suddenly Harry is about to face his toughest challenge in the Triwizard Tournament, as a mysterious 4th champion. He will face off against the Proud Victor Krum of Durmstrang School of magic, the fair Fluer DeLacour of Beaubaxtons magicical institute and his fellow student the popular Cedric Diggory.<br /><br />'The Goblet of Fire' is the best in the saga by far. The tagline says...'Everything Is Going To Change'. As the climax of the Harry Potter saga, the film was true to its word. This movie is far from the previous three. It has a PG-13 rating, ranging hormones and very disturbing ending. Still what made this movie so amazing was the work that was done to finally bring to life the one character that every fan has been wondering and waiting to see. Of course I am speaking about the Dark Lord Voldemort. Casting Ralph Finnes was the perfect choice, because he knows how to be the villain as you have seen in his previous work. His performance left me speechless and the fact he didn't even get nominated for a supporting actors Oscar shocked me...well at least Jake Gylenhall didn't get it either. Also the adding of Miranda Richardson and Brendan Gleason was also great. The regulars of the cast also did a fantastic job.<br /><br />What made me so happy about this new movie was the writers and new Director Mike Newell really looked at the past films and now thanks to the disaster of Azkaban, the right things were cut and added, the bonds of friendship were forged again and the cast finally played the correct rolls rather than just standing there for comic relief. As this first piece of the story comes to a close the stage is set for 'Order of the Phoenix'. With a darker chapter and a new director in the chair I am hoping that the last three films keep the fire that this film created.</p></br><a href="../users/A3T0OTH5072YRE.html">A3T0OTH5072YRE</a><br/><p>Ok, so I'm probably going to be fairly unpopular with my assessment of this movie, but considering the 4th book is probably my favorite (equally tied with the 1st) I expected a lot from the movie, and it just didn't deliver for me.  On a different subject though, if you're reading this review and haven't seen any of the other movies or read the books yet, turn around, go start at the beginning.  You'll regret it if you don't because such a wonderful series as this has to start at the beginning.<br /><br />Harry Potter is in his fourth year at Hogwarts, like usual he has the summer to be with his aunt and uncle though (who are loathsome people).  But this summer is a little different, the Quidditch World Cup is going on and Harry attends with his friends and their family.  But something goes terribly awry at the tournament, and it sets the tone for the rest of the year.  Harry's nightmares too point to something terrible happening, something involving Voldemort.  But at school these fears are quickly put aside when it is announced that the Tri-Wizard tournament will be held at Hogwarts, and include two other schools.  The all boys school Durmstrang, and the all girls school Beauxbaton.  One champion will be picked from each school to compete in a series of challenges and ultimately be the winner of the Tri-Wizard Cup.  The only problem is, Harry somehow becomes a fourth contestant, and the games can be brutal.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Daniel Radcliffe: Harry Potter<br />Rupert Grint: Ron Weasley<br />Emma Watson: Hermione Granger<br />Robbie Coltrane: Rubeus Hagrid<br />Ralph Fiennes: Lord Voldemort<br />Michael Gambon: Albus Dumbledore<br />Brendan Gleeson: Alstor Moody<br />Gary Oldman: Sirius Black<br />Miranda Richardson: Rita Skeeter<br />Alan Rickman: Severus Snape<br /><br />What can I say about Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson that I haven't already?  They make a great team on the set and you can truly believe they are the best of friends.  I enjoy watching them in every single movie.  The same with Coltrane as Hagrid, you can't help but love him as he stumbles around on the screen.  Gambon as Dumbledore had a larger part this time, and while I appreciated that, I just didn't feel the warmth from him like there is in the book.  He just was written more approachable than the role is actually played so that is a bit disappointing.  The new characters in this movie were cast ok, but none of them have the charm that the original cast members do.<br /><br />The plot did not really follow the book that well.  Sure there are plenty of moments that are the same, but for a lot of the important things it was vastly changed.  And I did not like that at all.  Especially the last challenge of the Tri-Wizard tournament.  It didn't even remotely resemble what was in the book and it was a very small part in the overall scheme of the movie.  It was disappointing.  The same with a lot of the interaction of the three schools.  So much was missed and I think it really detracted from the magic of the movie.  Actually, despite the movie being so long, it just felt rushed, like they didn't care about the details in this one.<br /><br />Luckily the cinematography was mostly back up to par in this movie.  Everything seemed more authentic, but as said before, lacking in detail.  There were so many things they could have included from the books to make it spectacular (sphinx anyone?) and they just didn't for whatever reason.  The music was still good, and I still get that shiver down my spine when I hear the opening music, so I'm glad that there is something I can rely on.  Although the music/choreography for the introduction of Beauxbaton was just plain weird to me (watch and see if you agree!).  By contrast, Durmstrang's entrance was much better.<br /><br />I'll always watch all of the movies and enjoy them, but I do admit I cringe a little bit when I get to this one.  If I hadn't have read the books I probably would have enjoyed it more, but it still would have felt rushed.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition) is the fourth series in the series. This time Harry Potter is a in a competition for the goblet of fire. This competition is a battle between 3 schools. Hogwarts, Beaubaton and Durmstrang. The special effects are amazing and the music is also quite brilliant. Some parts might scare small children so a grown-ups hand or a teddy bear can come handy. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.</p></br><a href="../users/A18HHKM6WGEF9D.html">A18HHKM6WGEF9D</a><br/><p>I think this is one of the more fun of the Potter movies, and one of the best suited for younger children, as it has a lot of action and 'color' due to the opening sequence at the professional Quidditch championship match, and the Tri-Wizard tournament once everyone arrives at Hogwarts. However, as other reviewers have stated, the lack of additional features on this edition is disappointing, but I've decided to dock only 1 star for that, rather than panning the entire movie because of this problem.<br /><br />The Triwizard tournament offers a lot of opportunity for great special effects, including the arrival of the other two teams - in a giant submergible ship, and a stagecoach pulled by flying horses. The Velas are a bit disappointing however, it seems most of their charms must have ended up on the cutting room floor. Other things also felt a bit rushed - the opening Quidditch match is superbly done, and I would have loved more time there. We also don't get to see any of Harry's opponents in the first Triwizard challenge - the dragon challenge - although Harry's battle with his dragon is superb. The other challenges are handled well though, and considering the amount of groundwork this movie has to cover, overall it does a great job.<br /><br />The dynamics of the characters are also done well, and the psychological challenges of adolescence as they unfold - Ron's initial jealousy, the growing tension/attraction between Hermione and Ron, Harry's burgeoning crush on Cho. These are important themes in the rest of the story, and they are handled well here. And when it all finally and definitely turns dark with the death of Cedric, it is heart-wrenching - the pain of his father grieving over his body changes everything (and of course, this part is not so good for young children, although I chose to show it to mine and talk through it.) This marks a turning point in the battle between good and evil as they play out in this series, and it was very critical that it was given the weight it needed.<br /><br />So overall, a great film, in terms of both special effects and the unfolding drama. Leaves us ready for the battle to begin in book and movie 5.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>I can tell you one thing - Robert Pattinson does a way better job as Cedric Diggory in this movie than he ever did as Edward in Twilight. This movie does a really great job with several scenes, particularly the one where Peter Pettigrew is reviving Voldemort near the end. If you liked the film series so far, you will definitely love this movie!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>this it the fourth instalment of harry potter and not disapointing. i loved the special effects and the actors are getting better and better with each movie. this is a really good movie. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>To me, HP4 is the weakest in the series. It's kinda boring and doesn't have too much of a plot. This year, Hogwarts host the Triwizard Tournament, in which one wizard from each of the three magical schools competes in three challenges. The champions are selected by the Goblet of Fire, a magical cup into which the candidates' names are placed. When the three are picked, a fourth name comes out of the goblet; Harry Potter. Each task is very dangerous. After the first task, there is a Yule Ball and shows that Hermione is beginning to fall for Ron. During the last task, Harry will come face-to-face with Voldemort reborn. If you love the series, I'm sure you'll love HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2.html">A3N8RZSXKN1OR2</a><br/><p>Harry Potter has known for years that Lord Voldemort wants to destroy him, but in this episode the knowledge comes home in a very personal way.  When Hogwarts is chosen as the site of the Triwizard Tournament and hosts teams from two other wizard schools, students under the age of 17 are specifically forbidden from entering their names in the competition--but somehow Harry's name ends up in the running, and what's more he's accepted.  This causes considerable tension and partisanship among Hogwarts students and leads to a serious break between Harry and his buddy Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), which is only worsened by their realization that Hermione (Emma Thompson) isn't just a grindy girl any longer.  That, in turn, leads to trouble with fellow competitor and Qudditch star Viktor Krum (Stanilav Ianevski), and to a triangle involving Harry, Cho Chang (Katie Leung), and competitor Fleur Delacour (Clemence Poesy).  In the end Harry learns just how--and by whom--the draw was rigged and must face Voldemort on a more dangerous footing than ever before.<br /><br />Given the length of the original book, a good deal unfortunately gets left out of the movie.  One of the high points, for example, is the Quiddith World Cup sequence, which is far too short (the impression I got is that the games are never even finished before Voldemort's Death Eaters put in an appearance).  Meanwhile a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, the former Auror "Mad-Eye" Moody (brendan Gleeson), arrives at Hogwarts, and two former prisoners at Azkaban, Igor Karkaroff (Pedja Bjelac) and Barty Crouch, Jr. (David Tennant), play vital parts.  Harry also discovers how unpleasant publicity can be when Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson), the aptly-named (she's both pestiferous and persistent) Daily Prophet reporter who has come to Hogwarts to cover the "human-interest" aspect of the games, turns out to be a gossipmonger and a distorter of everything that's said to her.  This is also the literal midpoint of the series and the place where it begins to turn much darker and scarier, foreshadowing the tests and trials still to come.  As has been pointed out before, kids who started reading the Potter books or watching the films when they first appeared should be old enough to handle everything, but the youngest ones, who don't have the advantage of growing into Harry's adventures along with him, may need a year or two before they can do as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>Now in his fourth year at school, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) becomes unwittingly involved in the infamous "Tri-Wizard Tournament," wherein champions from Hogwarts and two visiting wizard schools face frightening challenges in the hope of winning eternal glory.  With help from his buddies Ron and Hermione, Harry battles dragons, survives underwater, and faces a terrifying maze.  Equally scary for him:  He must choose a date for the Yule Ball.  He has his eyes on the lovely Cho Chang but is too shy to ask her.  Lord Voldemort and his Deatheaters play a prominent part in this installment as Harry faces a life and death duel.<br /><br />The movie is very well written and the acting is good, too.  The three kids are now playing 14-year olds and are showing a greater range of emotions.  There is much humor when it comes to dealing with the opposite sex, a talent the usually capable Harry seems to lack.  Watching the three at the Yule Ball is sweet and awful, as these things tend to be at that age.<br /><br />The soundtrack and special effects are wonderful as usual and the suspenseful story is acceptable and enjoyable for children over eight as well as older audiences.  If you're a Potter fan, you're sure to enjoy "Goblet of Fire."  This is the best of the series so far and definitely lives up to all expectations.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>It's the fourth year for Hogwarts, Harry Potter (Daniel Redcliffe) with Heromine Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grin) just saw the Quittich World Cup Finale tornument during their summer vacation until Lord Voldermort's Death Eaters trashes the place and giving a warning to the wizards and witches of the magic world. As Harry goes back to school, an upcoming TriWizard tornument is at hand soon for three schools of wizardary known as Hogwart's, Beauabatons and Durmstrang but only people who are 17 can join the tornument. A magical object called The Goblet of Fire choses who can be in the competetion as Harry has been chosen luckily to be the youngest member of the TriWizard tornument, with the help of not-so-trust worthy Professor Moody (Brendan Gleeson) with fellow student Cedric (Robert Pattison) to do 4 important task in order to become part of the match especially if he has to battle Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes).<br /><br />Co-starring Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Gary Oldman, Maggie Smith, Warwick Davis, Robbie Coltrane, Katie Leung, Jason Issacs, and Tom Felton  this is another outstanding installment of the Harry Potter fantasy epic saga. Sure it takes some liberties from the book as it's not as good but still great in it's own right, the acting is very improved here from the cast and here you can see Voldermort finally show up which was teased in Sorcerer's Stone. Here it gets more complex yet full of mystery and suprises galore, the special effects are very improved as well making them more belivable and there's darkness abound in this sequel. It's also about becoming mature and learning of themselves even if they have to face their own fears like Harry for instance, it's a another winner.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers the movie in sharp and perfect theatrical quality picture and wonderful sound with extras like deleted and extended scenes, featurettes, interviews, games and trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>I had some mixed feelings about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6EK2Y">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a>. Prof. Moody is probably the funniest of the Dark Arts professors in the series. Also, we see the kids grow up into teenagers. As cinematography, it's probably the best done movie of the Harry Potter series. The special effects (from dragons to Voldemort's minions) are great. The action is entertaining and captures some of the wonder of the world of wizards - more so than any of the other films thus far.<br /><br />That said, I feel like parts of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6EK2Y">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a> are just downright childish or silly. The whole ball and dating scenes made the film more like a high-school drama rather than fantasy - a "Wizards 90210." Also, the international wizards teams are boring stereotypes of the French and Bulgarians, rather than a more interesting group of characters. I understand the filmmakers had to make do with the material in the books. Still, if I had directed the films, I would have cut the ballroom scene out and included something more relevant to the plot.</p></br><a href="../users/A37PV5GMP2ILJC.html">A37PV5GMP2ILJC</a><br/><p>This one&#8217;s the best of all to date<br /><br />And still it ain&#8217;t enough<br /><br />They left out whole chunks of the book<br /><br />and all the Quidditch stuff<br /><br />Dursleys, Weasleys, house elves gone!<br /><br />The World Cup&#8217;s in one frame<br /><br />Rita Skeeter doesn&#8217;t morph<br /><br />Black&#8217;s just a head aflame<br /><br />No magic money from the sky<br /><br />No cash prize for the winner<br /><br />This movie is for HP fans<br /><br />And not for a beginner<br /><br />The goblet spews the fiery names<br /><br />Of the ones who will compete<br /><br />To represent the magic schools<br /><br />At the Triwizard treat<br /><br />For years it&#8217;s picked the chosen three<br /><br />But this time out comes four<br /><br />It&#8217;s quite a shock for all concerned<br /><br />Even for Dumbledore<br /><br />This Dumbledore&#8217;s a wimpy man<br /><br />His wardrobe&#8217;s really swishy<br /><br />Again he hires shady staff<br /><br />And can&#8217;t smell something&#8217;s fishy<br /><br />Three tasks are set, and all are tough<br /><br />With dragons, eggs and water<br /><br />The final takes them in a maze<br /><br />And leads them to the slaughter<br /><br />To understand about the tasks<br /><br />You&#8217;d need to read the book<br /><br />The movie leaves out far too much<br /><br />So please, read first &#8211; then look<br /><br />The dance was great, the settings lush<br /><br />This stuff never gets old<br /><br />The return of Ralph Fiennes&#8217; Voldemort<br /><br />Was something to behold<br /><br />They did their best within the time<br /><br />They couldn&#8217;t fit all in<br /><br />Next time we want a lot more Snape<br /><br />So let the fifth begin<br /><br />Amanda Richards, March 25, 2006</p></br><a href="../users/A239PPUVV8O0U0.html">A239PPUVV8O0U0</a><br/><p>Up to the point when this movie was originally released, this was the best out of the four. Being one of the longest books in the series, it was plainly clear to me that a lot was going to get cut out. In fact, pretty much all of the sub-plots are gone, making Harry (of course) the focus of the film instead of going into these pointless directions. For those who haven't read the books and have only seen the films, I don't find it necessary that we see Hermione preaching about the rights of house elves, Harry living at the Dursleys (I think after three movies, the audience gets that they're cruel to him) and the Weasleys taking him for the summer and the Quidditch World Cup. Much like my complaint about Ian Fleming describing eighteen excruciating holes of golf in Goldfinger and the movie version trimming it to the last two holes, you can't expect an audience to sit around and watch and still find the main story interesting. Another prime example of sub-plot cutting is Peter Jackson's adaptations of three LOTR books. If he had included Tom Bombadil's scenes, the audience would probably be still be watching Fellowship for at least another hour. Now that that rant's over, lets move on to the cast. Main cast is still excellent, and now they've finally discovered the opposite sex, which leads to some humorous moments and a stunning entrance by Hermione at the Yule Ball definitely made Harry and Ron's heads turn. Ralph Fiennes, who is practically unrecognizable under Voldemort's make-up (maybe he still feels ashamed for The Avengers), just oozes evil and I detect a hint of elegance in the character. Action sequences are some of the best though the dragon scene does drag a little but the fight with Voldemort is an exciting one. Patrick Doyle picks up the music department in this and, though ably picks up Williams' themes, adds his own touch to the franchise, making this a better score than the first two and just slightly better than the third.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Though some of the cutting and trimming process seems nonsensical (why include an unnecessary Rita Skeeter?) and most of the book's magic--for lack of a better word--is lost, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is one of the better adaptations (of one of the better books) the film series has to offer.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YB29BIDULEYE.html">A1YB29BIDULEYE</a><br/><p>This 4th chapter starts with Harry, Ron, and Hermione watching a spectacular circus act with some magical touches of course. We later learn that there is going to be an interschool magical olympics.  (It may be dangerous, and someone could even get killed.) We learn one of the great hypocrisies in this setting. (It's ok to have interschool or international games and tournaments, as long as its our school our country that wins.)<br /><br />While Harry is under 17 and too young to participate, his name ends up chosen to participate. Nice mystery to start things off. The cold, but virtuous Snape knows that something is not right. But he suspects that it may be easier to know what is going on if they let Harry participate. Very quickly, I have to admit I like the new Dumbledore. (Michael Gambon)<br /><br />In this movie, we start to see Harry, Ron, and Hermione having disputes. (Ron actually curses at Harry in this one.)  But like true friends, they put their disputes aside and move on. Good thing since this 4th chapter is getting dark.<br /><br />We also see that Neville still bumbles, but we can see that his character is getting interesting. He dances very well (to the surprise of a few people). He gets a date for the ball before Harry or Ron. And at one point, his immense knowledge of plants and herbs proves really useful to Harry at a crucial point.<br /><br />Before the final event of the tournament, Harry again has a dispute with Snape. (Snape suspects Harry of stealing his supplies.) This leads to a bitter exchange of remarks. And then the 'find the cup in the maze' contest turns out to have a VERY SURPRISING AND CATASTROPHIC end.<br /><br />There is a great climax as Snape is once again at Dumbledore's side as they quell at least part of the tragic situation. There is a notable sadness that ends this 4th chapter.<br /><br />If you read the book, you will undoubtedly miss how Snape and Dumbledore try to communicate with the obtuse Fudge about the return of a threat. You may also miss the uneasy reconciliation between Snape and Sirius. But overall, they did a great job of fitting the book into 2 hours and change.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>Where as the first Potter film seemed geared towards young children,  Goblet of Fire nearly seems the opposite.  Not that kids won't enjoy this, though it may be very frightening at times for very young children.  But the teenagers and even adults may find this to be a perfect fit for more mature entertainment.  The tr-wizard tournament is practically the most dangerous event Potter has dealt with yet.  Then there is the formal ball, where both sexes have officialy grown up.  There is even some innuendo, which surprised me from a Potter film, but it was still amusing.  And perhaps death and the reality of it is the biggest impact this film offers.  Oh yes, and Voldemort comes back into full form, played by a deliciously creepy Ralph Fiennes.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite Potter films because of how well balanced it was made.  Despite all the danger, fright and incredible CGI action, there is also humor and drama to balance out the equation.  It gives us a little bit of everything, which adds up to high interest and great pacing throughout.<br /><br />The tr-wizard tournament is the highlight of the movie, with Potter and three others competing in a very deadly and real sport.  There are three scenarios that must be won, each more frightening and deadlier than the first.  The first obstacle is aquiring a golden egg protected by a very deadly dragon.  Harry, ends up against the deadliest of dragons in what provides a very suspenseful and action-oriented showdown.  The following scene takes place underwater, in a scene that feels very frighteneing and creepy.  The last obstacle is in a massive hedge maze, with quite the feel of Claustrophobia as the hedges seem to come alive.<br /><br />I thought this was a huge improvement over the last film, Prisoner of Azkaban.  They succes to Goblet of Fire is that it gives us quite a bit of everything, and every scene seems to have a purpose, whether it be imprtance to the story or successfully entertaining.  Potter has definetly evolved into something that everyone can love, especially the grown ups.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 4.5<br />Characters - 4.5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>I am not a fan of wizards and magic. I've never read a Harry Potter book, but for some reasonm I enjoy the movies very much. Maybe it is just nice to escape reality for a little while and root for a very unasuming hero. What I always seem to like about Harry Potter is that he always lands on top but seldom knows what he's doing. Also it's nice to see action movies without the typical muscle bound hero who leaves everything behind him in a fire of explosions.<br /><br />The Goblet of Fire chooses who will compete in a TriWizard Tournament. Harry is not allowed to enter because of his age, but he ends up being entered as a fourth contestant. It is only at the end that we discover 'you know who' is behind it all for his own evil purposes, like being born again.<br /><br />The wizard tournament events are spectacular, stealing a golden egg from a dragon, saving friends from mer-people, and the scariest hedge maze since The Shining.<br /><br />Of course this flick has a sub plot about the kids at Hogwarts growing up and beginning to notice the opposite sex. A grand dance is given on Christmas Eve and those ackward moments are in abundance prior to and during. Harry may be able to fly a broom stick and outmaneuver a dragon, fight off underwater monsters, and face 'who know who' but he can't dance. You can't win them all.<br /><br />Great flick with superb special effects that make you forget it's all computers.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>This is a great film. It is probably my favorite HP movie. The acting is getting better and better with each film, especially from the younger actors. The scenery is wonderful and the plot pretty fun, though they did take some liberties from the book, though it doesnt deter it in any way. In fact, I found the changes did not affect the actual story whatsoever, and am glad for it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>Much darker than its predecessors, "Goblet of Fire" takes Harry and his friends into a darker corner of the wizarding world.  There are dragons, mermaids, a wicked maze, a new Dark Arts teacher(of course!), and something that hasn't been in the first three films so far--death.  Without giving away too much, just know that "Goblet" takes the viewer straight into the wizarding world, leaving out the Dursleys, trims up the book that it is based on and attempts to give the viewer the meat-and-potatoes version of the novel.<br /><br />The acting is superb, perhaps the best of the film series.  Daniel Radcliffe has grown quite well into his role as young Harry Potter, who is only beginning his years of teenage angst.  Emma Watson has blossomed into a lovely young lady, but Hermione is still just as prissy as she was before.  Rupert Grint has grown up more than any of the other characters both physically and as an actor.  He has a solid handle on Ron.  His twin elder brothers, Fred and George, get a little more spotlight in this film, and Oliver and James Phelps prove to the crowd that they are solid comic performers in this story.  Ginny Weasley(Bonnie Wright) returns in a supporting role.  Robbie Coltrane gets big and tall as Hagrid once again(but in a smaller role).  Of course, Draco(Tom Felton) and his gang are around to torment Harry, but they take a backseat to the Tri-Wizard tournament.<br /><br />Other returning characters include Dumbledore(Michael Gambon), Snape(Alan Rickman), Flitwick(Warwick Davis), and all of the other teachers from Hogwart's, not to mention Jason Isaacs as the wicked Lucius Malfoy.  New characters include Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody, Miranda Richardson as the hilarious Rita Skeeter, Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort, and Katie Leung as Cho Chang.  Three pivotal new characters, the Tri-Wizard competitors, are also introduced in "Goblet."  They are first-time actor Stanislav Ianevski as the athletic Viktor Krum, the lovely Clemence Poesy as Fleur Delacour, and Robert Pattinson as the honorable and trustworthy Cedric Diggory.<br /><br />The story moves at the fastest pace of any of the films so far.  There is some rather rough-and-tumble editing at points in the movie, but you have to give the director, Mike Newell, a mulligan for that considering the length of the book it is based on.  The special effects have greatly improved, and are nearly flawless.  Newell moves the story along at a smooth and quick trot, making the nearly two-and-a-half hour flick move along nicely.<br /><br />This is definitely the darkest film so far.  Folks who brought their young children to the first three films should preview this before allowing their youngsters to watch it.  A good film to measure this against as far as the PG-13 rating goes is any of the "Lord of the Rings" films.  If your child can handle that, they can handle "Goblet."<br /><br />*Potential Spoilers*<br /><br />The death of a prominent character may make this film a little tough for youngsters to view.  Definitely watch the last thirty or so minutes of this film without your child before they can see it.  When Voldemort makes his return, he is a grotesque creature, and Wormtail(Timothy Spall) quickly extinguishes one of the major characters in this tale.<br /><br />Also, the language is a tad bit stronger on this film than in the others.<br /><br />The opening sequence at the Quidditch World Cup comes to a violent end, so you might be wary of that before letting your youngsters view as well.<br /><br />Other than these particular moments, most of this story will be no worse than the other three.  This is an all-around good film, and I don't mean to take away from it by listing these few moments.  However, I don't think that my daughter, who has viewed the other films, should see the ending of this film until she's a little older.<br /><br />The enchanted candy is gone, this is a darker and more violent Harry Potter.  Still, I highly recommend it to fans of the books and the films, as well as anyone who enjoys fantasy flicks.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AIBRTGBN07D6A.html">AIBRTGBN07D6A</a><br/><p>ON THE FILM:<br />As a fan of all the previous Harry Potter films, and having read all of the books, I was really looking forward to "Goblet of Fire," especially since it was my favorite book as well. That may be why I was so disappointed after actually seeing it. The main problem with "Goblet of Fire," is that Director Mike Newell tried to condense way too much into a two hour movie. I know this has been a criticism of the previous films, but I have never agreed with it until now. There is no way to include everything from the books into the films, and in most cases the cuts in previous films have been just. However in this case, the book was way too long for a two hour movie.<br /><br />Noticeably absent are the relationships between Hermione and Ron, Harry and Cho, and Harry and Draco. Harry and Draco are enemies, and their rivalry has always played a very large role in the books, especially given Draco's actions in future books. His character had roughly 60 seconds of screen time in this film and a handful of lines. His scenes could have been cut out completely and it wouldn't have changed the movie much from the way it turned out. Professor Snape was given a similar treatment. Newell tried to display jealousy between Ron and Hermione, but it failed miserably as they did not have development for the audience to believe in it. The character of Rita Skeeter was introduced as a nosy reporter, however she added absolutely nothing to the movie and is another character that is very prominent in the book, but could have been completely cut out of this film and it would not have made a difference.<br /><br />The majority of the movie focused on the Tri-Wizard tournament, which was very well done, but was not the focus of the book and made for a film that kids would probably love, but does not do justice for the adult viewer who wants to see more character development. The final task of the tournament, the maze, was not adequately explained at all. In the book, the maze brings out the worst fears in someone and turns them against themseves. In the movie, it was condensed to just being a creepy maze that attacked you with roots.<br /><br />My other biggest problem was with the casting, specifically Michael Gambon as Dumbledore and Stanislav Ianevski as Viktor Krum. I've heard the complaints of Gambon not living up to the precedent set in previous films by Richard Harris, and never believed it until now. He comes off completely out of character from the Dumbledore in the book. He is gruff and abrasive in this film, at one point grabbing Harry and shaking him violently. Where is the wise and compassionate, yet still powerful, Dumbledore from the books? Ianevski looks good on the posters, but his acting seems too unseasoned for a role this big. Cedric Diggory and Fleur Delacour are very well casted however.<br /><br />Edit 5 January 2012 - Having seen all of the films in the franchise now, I actually appreciate this movie a lot more and think it is one of the better ones in the series. I still think it should have been cut into two films and feels condensed, but the tri-wizard tournament is one of the more climatic events during all of the movies and is very well done.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>GRANTED they can't squeeze the whole 735 pages of the book for a 2hour and some munites movie, you kinda felt disappointed but i'll live, if they did though i don't think i'll be able to watch a 4 to 5 hour movie in the threaters unless its a two part like kill bill then we wouldn't feel cheated and if most of you guys feel disappointed now I wonder how your gonna feel when they finish ORDER OF THE PHOENIX which consist of 870 pages might as well deal with it now so that way the disappoint won't hurt so bad when they don't put your favourite parts in the movie...BUT other than that<br /><br />I thought it was good and entertaing from the parts that they pick for the movie and its also good watching them grow up in to their roles each time a new harry potter comes out.<br /><br />I know everyone has their own opinion but sometimes i feel like there are 2 types of people on amazon, the type who really likes something and the type who hates on everyone for liking it, not because they think its bad but because they don't want to jump on the wagon like everyone else and admit its a good movie...</p></br><a href="../users/A2U80IPZXN5V1U.html">A2U80IPZXN5V1U</a><br/><p>I read the books of harry potter and own em and when i read book 4 it was really an unbelivable experience it was longer but how good!The autor j.k rowling really take you and make you feel like you were in front of everything that was was happening i wasnt just reading the book i was sort of living it and every time i stopped reading it was like;oh were am i?<br /><br />And i got that same reaction with the movie the producers have done so well the harry potter universe is hard to imagine and they captured it with so much class and the actors really do well while being part of it.The characters have grown a lot since the first movie and the producers really made that hapen.<br /><br />With the harry potter movies you really felt like the books and to reproduce such a long book to a movie with the same essence its unbelivable the animation,the story ,everything here is great.They captured most of the imporant parts and cut the less important but the result is very impressive.But the movie is for older audiences then the first 3 so they rated it pg-13.<br /><br />They argue with harry potter`s lenght yes its very long about 2 hours and a half but you get so much in the movie the first 3 movies were very surprising with amazing effects but consider that each year it gets more long,more complicated than before and the 4 says it all.<br /><br />They grown the characters over the years but there is a major change here as they experiment relashionships and other things.Also the arrival of the tri wizard tournament changes things.3 Schools including hogwarts are competing and competitors must be a certain age ,and the competitors must throw their name in the cup.3 Names are chosen one from each school,but after harry`s name gets picked.<br /><br />And the story really take place itself.The story is darker than before and as voldemort`s return and the cemetary scenes proves it but it isnt an horror movie.Many events like voldemort`s sign in the sky to the other hogwart competior`s dead keep the movie nonstop action and your heart pumping.The tournaments has the 3 events like in the book in wich the 3 round the other hogwart competitor dies.<br /><br />Harry must also deals with arrogant Rita Skeeter who try to write fake news of him,like his pretended loving relationship with hermione.Hermione gets invited to the ball by proffesional quiditch player Victor Krum while Harry and Ron dont get succes with the girls.<br /><br />All that to say this movie is totaly awesome Harry Potter fan or not dont miss it really impressive had the best special effects of the 4 movies and is truly outstanding!Rent it or buy it when it comes out!Its so awesome!</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>Great from start to finish. It's rare that a movie series gets better as it goes on. The first movie was great, the second was not as good as the first but still great, the third one was better then the second but not was good as the first and this one beats them all. I loved it from start to finish and I did not really enjoy the book I found it long and  borning. The movie cuts lots from the book but that's good the book was boring. The acting is great and the story was great. The story is more grown up, scary and the ending is just excellent. When the movie ended I was so mad becouse I did not want it to end.

A tent that looks small from the outside but is a castle on the inside. I liked the expanding campy maze with the creeps and brainwash that it held. I liked the gillyweed that makes Potters neck have gills. I liked the ball and the rock out concert after. I liked the ease of Potter and his friends and their love for one another. I liked the neat potions and the magic classes. But real magic. The bowl with things from the past floating in the water. The huge bathtub with suds and a ghostly funny girl to talk to. The broom riding, the adventures with dragons and a challenge with outstanding magic. Dinners with extrodinare fare, sweets and sours.

I enjoyed the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MQQI4UYT9C11.html">A2MQQI4UYT9C11</a><br/><p>My family enjoyed Goblet of Fire--my 12 year old said it was the scariest HP yet. I thought that the director did well to abridge the Quidditch Cup. We've seen a lot of Quidditch over the course of the earlier movies. They did add some neat new effects with the magical fireworks and the card show supporting the Bulgarian team. Played nicely against teenage love was Hagrid's infatuation with the giant headmistress of Beauxbatons--a head taller than Hagrid, if that's possible. I think that Emma Watson will have the best career of the young stars of the cast--she's growing up to be a beautiful young woman--both my daughter and I thought her ball dress was stunning. Ron and Harry will have to fight not to be stereotyped after seven HP movies, if they go that far. One thought I had about Ms. Rowling's message was that it might be about the hell we put our young children through in the name of "healthy" competition. Then again, she might just be telling a story.</p></br><a href="../users/ACEA95FQS1AVP.html">ACEA95FQS1AVP</a><br/><p>I thought this was the best of the 4 films. My only gripe is that they left out the part where Hermione captures Rita Skeeter as a bug after learning she's an animagus. Normally, I don't mind the editing in order to make the movie a reasonable length, but without that ending Skeeter was just an annoyance in the movie. Overall though, it was excellent.<br /><br />The deluxe 2 disk DVD is also well done. The featurettes have greatly improved over previous editions. The "Conversations with the Cast" was interesting and the three stars are well spoken and very funny at times. The piece on the Yule Ball expanded on the actors learning to dance, the set, and the scenes added that weren't in the book. And I, for one, am grateful I didn't have to "work" through some game to see the deleted scenes. The extras are worth the additional money versus the single disk edition.</p></br><a href="../users/ARMVAHWQQ9S8A.html">ARMVAHWQQ9S8A</a><br/><p>It must be incredibly hard to condense an epic book the size of "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" into a movie less than three hours, especially with a legion of hundreds of thousand of wild fans ready to break into violence if their favorite subplots are omitted, so we have to give the screen writers for this film credit in that department, to start off with.<br /><br />As the films get increasingly darker and the content gets more and more adult, they seem to get BETTER as well.  I'll start off with the bad parts so I can get right down to the good: The explanation of "Prior Incantatem" in the end of the movie was lacking, and as it is key to how the main conflict was resolved in the film, it should have been delved into deeper, as should have Harry's relationship with Sirius Black.  While it seems things move a bit too fast at first, upon second and third viewings, all falls into place.  There is one major problem I have with the film, though:  Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore is so far off of the mark that I can scarcely believe that the director did not send him off the set in a dunce cap.  The real Dumbledore is composed, unlike Gambon's version.<br /><br />Onto the good: Snape (played by Alan Rickman) is great as always, though he doesn't get much screen time.  Rupert Grint (playing Harry's best friend Ron) shines as always, and while Emma Watson (Hermione) is still finding herself as an actress, she does well.  Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) was never better than he is in this movie, and the movie-goers will be able to laugh, cry, and scream with him.  The actors who play Cedric, Fleur, McGonagall, and Hagrid are all on point, but the shining actor of the movie is Ralph Finnes, who plays the most evil dark wizard of all time, Lord Voldemort.<br /><br />The graveyard scene with Voldemort is frightening, and by far the best scene ever filmed for the whole franchise.  It could have gone wrong in so many ways, but it is utterly perfect, and terrifyingly real.  The way Ralph Finnes moves so smoothly, then bursts into an explosive thrust, the way he whispers threats, and then barks orders... Frightening.  Beautiful.<br /><br />Other scenes that are well done include:  Brendan Gleeson (as Mad Eye Moody) demonstrating the Unforgivable Curses, especially when he introduced the Imperius Curse as humorous only to slowly bring the class to the severe reality of it:  The Yule Ball is beautifully angsty, and the scenery is breath-taking, as is that of the tasks of the Triwizard Tournament.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is by far the strongest of the four already released, and it has a very, very high replay value.  For your own sake, go out and get the DVD as soon as you can.<br /><br />9/10</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>I've been waiting a year and a half for this movie and I can tell you that it was Definitely worth the wait! Even though Daniel, Rupert and Emma are much older than 14 (it's pretty obvious) they are so convincing as they learn about their feelings of maturity.  The selection ceremony for the Tri-Wizard tournament was humorous. The look of shock on certain characters faces is unforgettable! The tasks are fun and exciting even though I already knew what was going to happen! I thought that the Yule ball was absolutely spectacular, and Ron's dress robes were awesome! The movie was so well done, I'd have to say that it is the best movie in the series so far!  For fans of the movies, you'll find this installment a little darker, a little grittier, and a little more involving. The characters are growing up and are now facing more adult situations with more adult outlooks.<br /><br />It's unfortunate that so much of the book needed to be cut for time and the movie is still nearly 2 1/2 hours long.  A lot of story and character development isn't there.  But what there is is a great visual treat.  The special effects and the music in the this movie were the best yet! The underwater scenes especially were very well done.  This movie, like many, does have its shortfalls. I believe that Dumbledore was portrayed as a little too intense.  Instead of the benevolent, kind, and good-humored old man I have always loved in the books. As someone that has read the books, I must say another shortfall is that this movie banks on familiarity with the story. Having read the books, I found it very easy to follow, but I could understand how one who has not read the books may feel a bit lost, as some important information was left out and some back-story was left mostly unexplained.<br /><br />All in all I would say this is definitely the best movie in this series so far, and if the next three are on par with this one then I would be content.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>As the young actors who play the leading roles age, so do the characters in this fourth installment of the hit series.  While I didn't find GOBLET OF FIRE quite as entertaining as the preceding films, it certainly is well made and the three youngsters (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint) are certainly maturing as actors.<br /><br />Director Mike Newell, not known for doing action type films, uses an almost too lethargic pacing at times, focusing on the growing pains of the adolescents as they start thinking about the opposite sex.  Meanwhile, the special effects are awesome, the art direction superb, and the musical score soars.  The plot is a little too complex at times and some things aren't fully realized, but we do get Brendan Gleeson as the dark wizard; Ralph Fiennes as Lord Valdemont and the deliciously wicked Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter, the journalist with the need to know.  I wonder sometimes how Rowlins plans to continue milking what is basically a one note premise (the return of Valdemont and Harry's continued wizardy).  Sales of the books continue to rise and the movies are doing well so we'll see.  A good movie all around, though.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This film just didn't hang together as well as the first three, each of which was in my opinion a masterpiece.  For me, the story just wasn't as tight, the mystery of what was going on felt less alive, and for the first time the special effects seemed more important than the characters.  Even my daughter, who at 10 has read all the books and seen all the films with me, said, "Dad, that one just wasn't as good."  It was exactly how I felt, but then, she has always had to explain its intricacies to me, who will probably never read the books.  Moreover, this one is a bit too gory, and so we did not include our youngest, who at 6 would find it a bit disturbing or so we feared.<br /><br />In spite of that criticism, this film is still above average for a kid movie.  It is visually impressive, you know the characters, and the story line makes a decisive and ominous advance.  So overall, I would recommend this film.  We will definitely get for our collection, though will probably wait until the price goes down a lot more.</p></br><a href="../users/AHCVWPLA1O4X8.html">AHCVWPLA1O4X8</a><br/><p>Though I've never read any of the books in this series I can tell that part of Rowling's popularity stems from her ability to infuse the epic element into her popular children's books.  The Harry Potter story is not a superficial or predictable story-rather it is a story of near epic proportions that takes place in a world that is very rich both in detail and in history.  This is why I, at least, find the movies so compelling.  They're entertaining for kids, sure, but (like CS Lewis's Narnia series) adults can enjoy the story as well.  And the overall effect (that epic quality) is that the entire world in which these movies take place is one in which a thousand stories could be told.  This richness is why I like Harry Potter so much.<br /><br /> The movies have always done a great job of preserving the epic feel while still remaining very entertaining.  Unfortunately this movie didn't quite do that for me-maybe it's because of the length of the corresponding book.  For whatever reason, I felt left out of some of the "lore" of the movie, and found myself with questions about characters and events and wanting to know more.  The entertainment value is still here, of course, and this movie was definitely worth seeing.  But for the first time I felt like, since I was watching the movie without having read the book, I was missing out.<br /><br />Maybe this movie would benefit from an "Extended Version" going into more detail of some of the `back stories.'  I know that's certainly something I'd be interested in.  Despite this shortcoming, however, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a very good film, complete with great acting and awesome special effects.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>They seem along with J.K.

"Never mind the quill". I think many of us share her view of this annoying brand of news media that twists the truth. What I really adore about the entire Potter series is the way the writer has allowed Harry's character to grow up.

I managed to get the Hologram  package which is a great set. The only downfall on the second  disc is the interactive game, which works well for kids, but is not the best for adults.

With this film, the fourth entry in the "Potter" film franchise, that doesn't change, even though the MPAA has finally given a PG-13 rating to one of the films (Which they should've been doing since the first one).<br /><br />The film itself is actually pretty good. The cast and crew do a commendable job of transferring a 700+ page book into a two-and-a-half hour film. The acting is good, including a sinister turn by Ralph Fiennes as the resurrected Lord Voltemort that even had me terrified. The visual effects are top notch, and the storytelling is good for the most part. But the film's darker edge, as well as a few moments of sheer tragedy, make it unsuitable for younger viewers, even those who are ardent "Potter" fans. But there's some good to be found here, so I recommend the film for those older fans.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: B+</p></br><a href="../users/A31RM5QU797HPJ.html">A31RM5QU797HPJ</a><br/><p>The 4th Harry Potter movie is the first of the movies to earn the PG-13 rating..and it won't be the last.

That's right, Harry and Ron truly discover that Hermonie is a girl.<br /><br />  The Triwizard Tournament takes place at Hogwarts, and Harry is looking forward to it...until his name comes out of the Goblet Of Fire and joins the tournament.  The tournament has 3 tasks of which the four champions must face.  The first task is to get a golden egg from a fierce dragon.<br /><br />  But that's not all what's happening.

This is the best of the movies, the actors, especially Radcliffe, really grow into their characters, and the film is paced very well.  Fiennes as Voldemort is perfect, I look forward to seeing more of him.  Though I like Gambon as an actor, I am not sold on him as Dumbledore, he just does not connect with the young actors like Harris did, you felt Harris' Dumbledore loved Harry, with Gambon you don't feel that, it's odd, they have no chemistry.  The special effects in this film are very well done, and I loved how the snake comes out of the title letters at the beginning, that was inspired.  The extra's are o.k., the outtakes are cool, but I expected more, but that's a minor quibble.  I highly recommend this DVD, it's the class of the series.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Before year four at Hogwarts starts, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) gets a real treat.  He joins the Weasleys and Hermione (Emma Watson) at the Quidditch World Cup.  But what should have been a fun trip turns serious when the campground is destroyed and a giant skull shows above the area.  The skull is the sign of the evil Voldemort.<br /><br />All that gets forgotten when the trio return to school.  Hogwarts is playing host to the Tri-Wizard tournament.  One student each from three wizarding schools will be competing in a series of dangerous contests.<br /><br />But things start out weird when Harry's name is called as a fourth contestant.  He's three years younger then the rest of them, yet he still must compete and survive the competition.<br /><br />Meanwhile, there is yet another new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  Mad Eyed Moody (Brendan Gleeson) seems to have taken a particular interest in Harry.  Can his tips help Harry make it thought the contest?<br /><br />I first saw this movie in the theater and loved it.  I have since started reading the books and expected it to change my take on this movie.  After all, the movie takes a 740 page book and turns it into a two and a half hour movie.  You know they will be leaving stuff out.<br /><br />Actually, however, the movie works.  Yep, there were lots of things left out of the book, but they did a good job of covering the important plot points without losing those who haven't read the book.  That's impressive.<br /><br />Ironically, they did add some things for the movie.  The most noticeable is the first task.  While dangerous in the book, they made it much worse here.  That time could have been used for something else, but it does make for a dramatic scene.<br /><br />The only weak part is the ending.  It is so rushed that it doesn't make the emotional impact that it does in the book.  And it glosses over some of the things that made the ending of the book such a big cliffhanger.<br /><br />Once again, I must say that this is the best movie version of the book we could hope for.  If you view it on its own, you'll enjoy it.  And if you haven't read the book, you'll love it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Whoa! Potter is a big teenager, and there are no childlike scenes here. I want to say I appreciate the one reviewer that reads the books but only pointed out things from the book that probably should have been included to clarify some things. They are very valid points. At least she did not give us a blow by blow why the movie wasn't the book. I will probably get some negative votes because I am fed up with some book reviewers reviewing movies as though they are the same medium. The movies can no more be the book than the book can be the movie. Once you understand that is not possible you will begin to appreciate the fact that a great deal of effort goes into bringing the ESSENCE of the book to the big screen. As well pointed out unfortunately sometimes the screenwriters, directors, etc. don't get it right and there is something missing that should have been included from the book. The movies are all great and this one certainly is almost as good as the others. Harry must once again prove himself to his friends and the school.<br /><br />This time in a Tri-Wizard contest which he didn't even volunteer to be in. How was he selected? But that is only the beginning of questionable things happening. There is a bit more friction between him and Ron this time. But then considering their ages and the competitive nature of school, is it any wonder? The characters are further developed and the storyline is incredible. The special effects in the magic scenes are excellent. By far the scariest, and not for small children as some scenes are very intense. He must battle not only formidible creatures but his own mortality as well and watch the death of a friend. It will keep you guessing who he can trust to the very end. What struck me most is how much the people playing the characters, and the characters too have aged and matured. As in the books this story is definitely darker than previous ones. I highly recommend it for the adults, but not children and I am sure Rowling would tell you her books were never meant for young children. A bug being tortured, child morphed and tormented, Harry almost drowning, scary mermen attacking, a girl dragged underground by plants, and a young man being killed is not for the faint of heart. A must if you have the other three, but not  as lighthearted as the first two and even darker than the third.</p></br><a href="../users/A1O60Q7LBN4MQ.html">A1O60Q7LBN4MQ</a><br/><p>I enjoyed it but I wish they wouldn't make movies so long.

The movie was so well done and it does the book justice.<br /><br />Part of this review I copyed off of IMDB.com</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>For the first time ever, I was NOT entertained by a Harry Potter movie.  Something was seriously wrong with the entire thing.  I remember the happy look on my face when I found out that HBO would be airing Goblet of Fire in late November.  I waited patiently for the new Harry Potter film like a snake in the grass.  Just the magical atmosphere of the previous three Potter movies made me want to crave another one, and crave it BADLY.  Turns out I was surprisingly disappointed with it.<br /><br />I hated that the first 45 minutes really didn't do much in the way of keeping my interest.  I thought that whole portion of the film was pointless.  It was like they were trying to recapture the mysterious atmosphere from Chamber of Secrets, but not so interesting the second time because we've already seen it before, and done MUCH better then.<br /><br />Another crappy part of the plotline- Harry Potter goes to dancing class with his friends.  I'm not kidding.  Why would anyone find this interesting?  It was a waste of time.  To make matters worse, a fairly lengthy amount of time was devoted to it.  Just silly.<br /><br />Look, I LOVED the previous three Harry Potter movies, but this one just didn't do anything for me.  It was like the writers have finally run out of ideas, and the feeling I got was that the only reason this movie exists is to either make more money, or, probably more realistically, the writers wanted to give hardcore Potter fans more storyline and top-notch production to cheer about.  Hey, I can't blame them for that.<br /><br />Harry Potter fans love the books and the movies.  We know this from experience by the way people stand outside at midnight waiting for either the new book to be released or the new movie to be shown. So if the fans are happy with this film, good for them.  I sure wasn't.  To me, Goblet of Fire had a "been there, done that" vibe, and I simply can't look at it any other way, unfortunately.<br /><br />To sum up this disappointing film- a few interesting action scenes (one exciting memorable scene in particular was Harry challenging a giant flying bird thing- sorry, I don't know what you're supposed to call the darn creature) in between a LOT of unnecessary dialogue that apparently is only interesting if you happen to be a REALLY big Harry Potter fan.  For the people out there reading who just *enjoy* the Potter films but aren't obsessed- stick with the previous three.<br /><br />(updated thoughts- January 2, 2007)-<br /><br />Okay, watching the movie a second time (which seems to be necessary, I apologize) I actually really like the movie after all.  I give it a rating of 4 out of 5.  The segments I originally thought dragged, were actually pretty good.  They WERE telling a good story here after all, it just wasn't obvious I guess.  The action scenes were pretty spectacular as well.  Harry Potter is just getting older and becoming an adult, that's probably why I hated it at first.  I didn't really care for the whole dancing plot in the middle of the movie (which was about 15 boring minutes long) but that's the only serious complaint.</p></br><a href="../users/A4X7FBQ5SKPI6.html">A4X7FBQ5SKPI6</a><br/><p>...will just GO AWAY!  So tired of the Harry Potter bandwagons, they circle around with all these people who have no sense of literature or imagination, obviously the fiction world must be hurting if all the zombies ever do is fall all over each other with glee from this garbage.  Good riddance Harry sorry bro but you had to go, now please disappear so the world may start turning again.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>As a viewer who is somewhat dispassionate about the "Harry Potter" franchise, I thought it might be interesting to weigh in on "Goblet of Fire."  As a point of reference, I have not read any of the novels--nor am I the target demographic for this type of film.  I have seen the other three entries in the series, and I have found elements in them that I have enjoyed.  But overall, while I see their appeal, they just haven't spoken to me as anything other than a pleasant diversion.<br /><br />That said, for the first time, "Harry Potter" captured and kept my attention.  This was the first picture (from start to finish) that I followed intently--and I found it a really enjoyable film.  Many people have summarized the plot much better than I ever could and many have done the book to film comparisons, so I offer a complete "outsider's" perspective for the casual viewer.<br /><br />I think what is starting to elevate the series for me is that the young actors are aging.  So in "Goblet" we're starting to see budding sexuality and romantic interests.  The series has always seemed a bit emotionless for my taste--more flash than substance.  So I am pleasantly surprised to see character development within the group of protagonists.  The story held my interest, I felt there were moments of real danger and intrigue--not just kids playing anymore, but life and death stakes.  There is a real resonance and emotion in this film, especially toward the end, as what transpires results in dire consequences.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson, in particular, seem to be rising to the opportunity of having meatier and more developed roles.  Ralph Fiennes joins the cast as a believable villain--Voldemort, Brendan Gleeson is terrific as the morally ambiguous Mad-Eyed Moody, and Miranda Richardson is quite funny as an intrepid reporter.  Overall, the darker mood of this film suits a more serious interpretation and the PG-13 rating allows a harder edge.  A solid film, for me, this is a 4 star--and I actually look forward to the next film.

The movie adaptation ,though decent enough on its own, takes far too many liberties with the book, leaving out many crucial plot points.<br /><br />The story in a nutshell - Harry and his friends Ron & Hermione enter their fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and find the school playing host to students from Beaubaxton & Durmstrang schools of magic. The main event of the year is the Triwizard Tournament, where one champion from each school will be selected to participate. Of course, Harry finds himself [without entering his name] being selected to participate as well, and together with the other three selected champions [Cedric Diggory from Hogwarts, Fleur de la Couer from Beaubaxton, and Viktor Krum from Durmstrang] embarks on fulfilling the three tasks set for them, encountering intrigue, danger, and also the very possible rise of a menacing evil in the form of Harry's arch nemesis, Lord Voldemort.<br /><br />As for leaving out crucial plot points, the movie does not develop the strengthening bonds developing between Harry and his godfather Sirius Black, which is very much evident and well-developed in the book. The moviemakers also took a lot of liberties in changing some events to suit the movie, even changing the characters at times [in the book it is Dobby the house elf that helps Harry with the second task, not Neville Longbottom as portrayed in the movie]. There are other quibbles that I shall not enumerate here, for the sake of brevity.<br /><br />That being said, the movie itself is quite fun to watch, I liked the way the Beaubaxtons, and Durmstrangs made their entrance. Also, the underwater scene for Harry's second task in the Triwizard Tournament is superbly done. The actors playing Harry[Dan Radcliffe], Ron {Rupert Grint]& Hermione [Emma Watson] have truly matured in their roles here, and their performances make for compelling viewing. Hermione has blossomed into a beautiful young lady, and the boys too seem to be taking notice of the opposite sex [[both develop crushes], all very natural given that they are now young adolescents. The Yule Ball is depicted beautifully on-screen. The actor playing Mad Eye Moody [the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher] is quite a treat to watch, with his weird goggling eye, and mannerisms.<br /><br />The CGI effects are impressive as with the other Potter films -there are dragons, grindylows [water demons] etc to entertain viewers.Overall, though this is a fun movie, I still prefer the previous three in the Harry Potter franchise, mostly because the first three tried their best to stay faithful to the books, and this one took too many liberties[though I admit at over 700 pages long, it is a bit hard to include every single important detail]. Nevertheless, I would recommend adding it to your collection if you're a fan of the series.</p></br></body></html>

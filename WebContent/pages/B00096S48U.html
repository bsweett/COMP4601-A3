For example, as bad as the new Amityville was, it did attempt to provide an update in script.  It still stunk, but you could at least sense that the scriptwriters were trying to jazz the new version up.  With the new Omen, you have a very faithful remake, but without the gravitas of Gregory Peck and Lee Remick to heighten the horror.  Liev Schieber and Julia Stiles are pretty good, and the script writers were actually clever in explaining how Schieber could land the plum ambassoder post (he's the president's godson), but this isn't enough to compare with the older Peck's growing awareness and horror of just who his son might be. (And let's face it, Peck looked like an Ambassador.)  Then there was Lee Remick.  No one had eyes like Lee Remick, especially when she was using them to express alarm and terror.  She was a great actress.  In contrast, especially if you've seen the original, Stiles and Schieber look like 30 somethings playing house.<br /><br />As far as the devil kid, Damien, he could have been a CGI representative from the first one, I couldn't tell (which should give you an idea as to how slick this new version is).  He really makes very little impression, and I seem to recall the original kid as at least radiating malevolence.  Also, and somewhat slavish, is how David Thewlis as the freelance photographer seems to have been cast for the part because he faintly resembles David Warner, right down to the nervous mannerisms.  Come on, at least let the actors bring something new to the table!  The one standout performance is Mia Farrow as the evil Mrs. Baylock.  The original had Billie Whitelaw playing Mrs. Baylock, and she was outstanding, so Farrow had to come up with a fine performance to at least match Whitelaw's diabolic effort.  The good news is that she does quite well with the part, and it serves as the one attempt at a departure from the original.  You could do worst with this new Omen, but you could do better - by seeing the original film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EAU736LWTDCE.html">A3EAU736LWTDCE</a><br/><p>This is a review from a die hard horror movie fan:<br /><br />Sorry, but first I must put the smack down on the "bible nut" that bashing this movie: to the annoying guy quoting the bible, please feel free to research what I am about to tell you: Just last year they discovered a fragment of the oldest surviving copy of the new testament.  It was all wrote in ancient Greek, in the third century. Basically, after scholars deciphered "the oldest documents", they determined the mark of the beast is closer to "616". So much for your 6 o'clock, 6 day, 6 month garbage! Am I saying they are right? No. I really don't care either way, but it proves no one really has a clue what really happened and people make up their own suppositious rules to live by. As far as I am concern today isn't even 6-6-6. it is 6-6-2006.<br />6-6-6 happened thousands of years ago, did the world end at 6 o'clock that day? Phfft!<br /><br />  Again, sorry for the delay, now on to my review. I think it is funny how movie goers are bashing these waves of new horror movie remakes that keep hitting theaters. Everyone cries that the original was better or they say "I wish it was more like the original". Well here you go folks, you want the same old rehash movie that you can rent right at your local video store? Then go right ahead and pay the extra price to go to the theater and see the same movie. THIS IS WHY PEOPLE REMAKE OLD HORROR MOVIES DIFFERENT FROM THE ORGINAL FORMAT! I also don't get the reviewer who says this is "not as good as the original" To me this is the original. Same deaths, same story, no surprises. Why not improve on it? I was hoping for something totally new with more action, more modernization, more deaths, more fx, and maybe even a little more of Damien's life: growing up and taking over the world. They could have done way more with this movie. I know other horror fans are going to hate me for saying this, but I must first promise you, I am as big of a horror movie fan as they come, If I wasn't, I would not have ran out and seen this movie on 6-6-06. With that being said, I always though the original Omen was very boring. Unfortunately, this movie captures that aspect of the original all too well! At least it does have more action in it than the da vinci code!<br /><br />Verdict: I must agree with the guy who said "Unnecessary remake" If you really want to see this new Omen movie, then just save yourself  several dollars and go rent it for a couple bucks at your local video store. It is literally the same movie. I will give it credit for the improved deaths scenes. Which was the only highlights of the movie, but improved as they were, in the end, they were the same deaths as the original. More gore please! Its not a bad movie, I didn't dislike it. I just felt like I rented the original Omen movie again and paid way too much to see it on a big screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FUBUJAIGM87T.html">A3FUBUJAIGM87T</a><br/><p>It was quite disappointing to see "The Omen III The Final Conflict".  Aside from a few good death scenes including a very realistic suicide, "The Omen III" really fails as a competent sequel to the first two installments of this series.  This movie gets away from what is really scary about the Anti-Christ and miserably fails in its attempt to decipher and reconcile its movie with the Book of Revelations of the Holy Bible.<br /><br />Sam Neil does a competent at best job of portraying Damien and he certainly presents the evil side of Damien.  However, that being said, the rest of the acting was rather poor.  I found the ill-conceived romance between Damien and the English reporter rather dull, commonplace and disingenuine.  It appears that the screenwriter and director were trying to steal some scenes with this one sided love story and "child" theme which focuses on the hideously misguided child of the English reporter.  The long and boring scenes associated with this romance and the child really drag this movie down.  I really think that the screenwriter and director for this flick struggled with what to do with this story at this point and this fact is easily picked upon while viewing this very mediocre horror flick.<br /><br />The action unfolds with Damien firmly entrenched in a high political position.  Of course, Damien wants more power and he knows how to get it too...he just kills people to ascend the political heirarchy.  However, there are those that are on to Damien now and a company of priests each armed with one of the sacred knives set out one at a time to kill the antichrist.  Each fail in their attempt and befall horrible deaths in their respective endeavors.<br /><br />The crux of the movie relies on the Second Coming of Jesus Christ and I must say that "The Omen III: The Final Conflict" does a horrendous job of portraying the circumstances surrounding the upcoming great event of all-time, although it would be difficult for any movie to successfully capture this particular phenomena as evidenced by the atrocious "The Seventh Sign".  Of course, Damien wants to kill the "Nazarane" as he calls him and he systematically seeks the destruction of all newborns born on the same day as the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />As I said, there are some good death scenes in this movie, but overall, the movie is just plain boring and indicates a lack of vision and poor direction about how to go about pulling off a finale for such a great series as "The Omen" and "The Omen II" had set on the proverbial table so to speak.  "The Omen III" just does not have the same horrifying feel or atmosphere that the first two movies provided and ultimately fails to follow up on two of the greatest horror movies of all-time.<br /><br />In short, the series was best left undisturbed after the classic "Damien: The Omen II" which was an equally horrifying experience as the original "The Omen."  I highly recommend the first two, but cannot recommend "The Omen III: The Final Conflict".  That being said, this movie is a masterpiece compared to what is coming out in today's theaters.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Snooze Fest, Watch Parts 1 and 2 instead, a Lowpoint after the first two. but perhaps not as bad as the 4th installment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A.html">A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A</a><br/><p>New Rule For Hollywood= If you can't do something new with it, quit remaking older movies. Without Gregory Peck and Lee Remick this loses most of the power the original had. Other than Mia Farrow's stunning turn as the nanny this is one big waste of time to me. I know others may like it and if you do that's cool, I just can't recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Although one wonders why it even needed to be made in the first place - let's face it the original 1976 horror classic wasn't that good in the first place - this slick and haunting remake does the job quite well, and in many respects is even better than its predecessor. This stylistic remake is certainly one of the better films about hellfire and brimstone and devilish possession to be released in recent years.<br /><br />The antichrist has finally been born in the form of a deceptively cherubic little boy, who brings Armageddon to the home of a powerful and respected U.S. ambassador Robert Thorne (a brooding Liev Schreiber).  His wife Kate (Julia Stiles) doesn't know that the babies were swapped at birth, and that her real child has died and she must never know his secret.<br /><br />They name the child Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) and shower him with love. Life is wonderful, Thorn is appointed American ambassador to Great Britain, and the couple moves to a beautiful estate near London, with their healthy son, and a golden political future. But of course Damien no ordinary boy. His real mother is in fact a jackal.<br /><br />On his sixth birthday those around Damien start to die. His first nanny hangs herself. Father Brennan (Pete Postlethwaite) repeatedly tries to warn Mr. Thorn of his family's fate, but Thorn just doesn't want to listen. A sinister and snarling dog appears to act as an unwanted watchdog over the child and gorillas in the zoo shriek and run from Damien in terror.<br /><br />Suddenly, the sweet and soft-spoken Mrs. Baylock (Mia Farrow) arrives but she's really a deceptively evil nanny from hell, sent to protect the child. And a photographer (David Thewlis) discovers bizarre markings in his photos that threaten death for the Thorns unless Damien is destroyed. It all gets creepier and scarier and the Thorns' slowly realize who and what their son is.<br /><br />Restraint seems to be the order of the day here, as director John Moore builds the action and atmosphere steadily. Both Stiles and Schreiber give beautifully understated performances and the lovely Ms. Farrow - all concentrated eyes and disturbing smiles - brings the needed prestige to the film.<br /><br />Filmed in Prague, The Omen has the creepy look that one should expect from this genre and the gorgeous cinematography juxtaposes the cold daylight of reality with the hidden dangers in seemingly ordinary people. Remakes don't usually live up to originals, but in this case The Omen looks sharper and plays classier than the first film, and is a quite enthralling, inventive and ultimately bone-chillingly gratifying.

The acting feels flat exception being Mia Farrow and Giovanni Lombardo Radice (aka John Morghen of Italian horror explotation fame) and there's nothing scary about it like the original. It just feels like one epic fail here as i should say that some movies like the original and Psycho just don't need improving upon and if their plan of attack is to remake an already successful original by using a shot-to-shot script-by-script carbon copy clone remake then don't be surprise when they fail miserably, if we wanted to see the original movie we'd watch it. Plain and simple.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray contains very good picture and sound with extras being featuretes, a BD exclusive known as "Devil Tracks", commentary and trailers.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>"The Final Conflict" ties "The Omen" series up quite nicely.  The film is not so much a horror film but a race against the clock.  Damien Thorn(Sam Neill) is trying to vanquish all opposition to his assuming his place as evil overlord of the Earth before the prophesied return of Christ.  A group of priests are out to eliminate Damien before he can enact his diabolical plan.  "The Final Conflict" has to viewed after seeing the preceding films because it assumes that you've seen them.  It works more as a stand alone than the preceding film, "Damien-Omen II".  Unlike the previous film, however, I would give it four stars even I hadn't seen the others.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>Nothing new can be said that hasn't already been uttered about the classic '76 original with Peck and Remick.  Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar-winning score, Richard Donner's deft direction, David Seltzer's taut screenplay, the European locations, and the performances from the stars, including a frightening turn from Billie Whitelaw as "Mrs. Baylock", resulted in making this one of the best films of the 70's.<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars<br /><br />The sequel, "Damien: The Omen II", upped the body count significantly but is still a worthy successor, with fine performances by Holden, Grant, and Jonathan Scott-Thomas as the teenaged Damien. Goldsmith delivers another great score and Don Taylor's direction, though not as polished as Donner's, is adequate.<br /><br />Rating: 4 1/2 stars<br /><br />Sadly, the third film, rather than being a thriller, tends to be comedic, especially with the slew of inept monks "hell-bent" on destroying the anti-Christ, portrayed in this film by a miscast Sam Neill.  The film's only saving grace is Goldsmith's score, a bit more restrained this time.<br /><br />Rating: 2 1/2 stars<br /><br />However, it's not as bad as "Omen IV: The Awakening," a cheesy intent to "re-boot" the franchise with a satanic little girl in place of the previous male spawns of Satan.  As far as the acting goes, character actor Michael Lerner delivers in the role of a private investigator, who like David Warner in the original, becomes embroiled in the evil goings-on of storyline.<br /><br />Rating: 2 stars<br /><br />The 2006 remake is included and is further indication that one shouldn't mess with a classic.  Though Liev Schrieber and Julia Styles do their best in the roles, they pale in comparison to Peck and Remick in the original.  Even young Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick comes nowhere close to being as menacing as Harvey Stephens in the first film.<br /><br />Rating: 3 stars<br /><br />All presentations are in widescreen format with the color and sound being very good.</p></br><a href="../users/ADLVFFE4VBT8.html">ADLVFFE4VBT8</a><br/><p>A somewhat subdued 'end of days' thriller, following in the footsteps of the terribly acted 1976 original, the 6/6/06 Omen is equally badly acted but that's okay because good acting would have spoiled its almost Greek tragedy texture. Actors wearing masks would have been more proper.<br /><br />Sometimes crossing the line into 'exploitation' territory - suggesting that 9/11 and the last Space Shuttle crash were events described in the Book of Revelation - the Omen is someone one may want to watch on Halloween night after making sure that small children aren't present. There are no significant additions or innovations when compared to its 1976 predecessor other than a few CGI touches that make some of the more gruesome scenes look a little more 'real'. Other than that, Damien walks the exact same path and the movie ends with him exactly where we expected him to be, having watched the original release.<br /><br />The Blu-ray treatment does enhance the viewing experience and the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 sound is as good as it gets. Other Blu-ray enhancements include the "Devil's Notes" option which splashes little trivia notes on the screen, sometimes but not always related to what is being shown. We get to learn, for example, that the movie's first day earnings were a dollar figure that ended in 666, that Mia Farrow has several relatives named Damien, about the 6 classes of demons and their characteristics and a lot about various Satan-worshiping or admiring cults and movements.<br /><br />Additional features include an alternate commentary sound track, a feature on the composing and performing of the lugubrious sound track music and a surprisingly long and generally boring 22-minute discussion where various authorities on the subject such as author Tim LaHaye, someone who was born on 12/6/66 and other people in the know tell us that 666 is a very mysterious and troubling number.<br /><br />Overall, it's not a bad movie and it more or less met my expectations. The crisp Blu presentation and the modernized recreation of an old almost-classic earn it its 3 stars meaning "It's OK".</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>Omen 3: The Final Conflict (1981) was a four star sequel and pretty darn good for number three in any series.  The best thing about this film was that it introduced many of us to Sam Neill who was quite good in the role of Damien. After this movie I started taking note of all the films that he made.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>I think this is the best of the OMEN trilogy. It is definitely the most believable for this genre. Sam Neil is very good as Damien. Powerful Gerry Goldsmith score and great cinematography and atmosphere are outstanding. There is gratuitous violence and killings along the way but these are played down and are very low-key compared to this film's predecessors. For instance, the outrageous violence was the focus of the second OMEN film. This film puts these on the backburner and focuses on the central characters and theme. This is a very impressive film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OS2HX2CWQIC7.html">A1OS2HX2CWQIC7</a><br/><p>Hollywood will not rest until every notable horror film produced in America during the '70s or Japan over the course of the past decade has been remade. Even then, the terrible temptation of the sequel will not be resisted. A remake of the great Satanic classic The Omen was by no means necessary, so here it is!<br /><br />This remake distinguishes itself from most of the others pumped out by major studios by not being in any way terrible. There is nothing trashy and very little that is particularly stupid in The Omen, which is actually quite refreshing. However, there is also very little that's original here. This is perhaps the most stringently faithful remake that I've ever seen, so much so that I was able to predict nearly every single occurrence in the film ten minutes before it happened. Even the dialogue in many of the scenes is often identical to that of the source. The few variations of the story are manifest as surprises, most of which are quite effective. This film induces a few shocks and a couple of genuine scares, but that's about all. Most of this is a rather dull retread of the 1976 classic.<br /><br />One of the primary sources of this blandness is Liev Schreiber, who is as wooden as a crate in the lead. I can only imagine that whichever relative stuck his foot in the door for Schreiber was the same person who did him the disservice of telling him that he can act. He affects a baritone that sounds vaguely similar to that of Gregory Peck at times, but most of his lines are delivered in a monotone and he quite literally expresses almost no emotion over the course of the entire feature. He smiles once, tries (and fails) to emote a few times and generally makes an ass of himself. Schreiber has a keen look about him and some screen presence, but he simply can not act, and whoever chose to cast him in a lead role doesn't deserve the job. Any comparison drawn between Schreiber and Peck is laughable. Gregory Peck was one of the most charismatic, commanding actors of his generation; Liev Schreiber is good-looking window dressing.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is actually quite good. Stiles (whose Celt face is chubbier all the time) capably substitutes for Lee Remick; neither as convincing nor shrill as her predecessor, her performance is decent, and leagues more impressive than her awful dye-job. Pete Postlethwaite plays a more subdued, less intense Father Brennan as compared to Patrick Troughton's wild-eyed delivery. Mia Farrow's role as Luciferian nanny Baylock is quite well-played and her casting is a clever (albeit obvious) reference to Rosemary's Baby...the trouble is, how many devoted horror fans are going to watch this to recognize the intent in the first place? While not quite a weak link, Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick is hardly as cute or creepy as the original Damien, Harvey Stephens.<br /><br />John Moore's direction is at times very impressive; many of the scenes here are beautifully framed, and the editing is excellent. However, Jonathan Sela's cinematography bears mixed fruit. Some of the bright, oversaturated scenes evoke fond memories of the grainy 35mm stock on which so many '70s B-movies were shot. This has nothing to do with The Omen and it's implemented infrequently here, but it is a nice look. Unfortunately, most of the film is predictably tinted with color filters, a photographic trend that's become as ubiquitous as it is excessive in contemporary American films, and especially those of the horror genre. A hint for Mr. Sela: dim back lighting produces much creepier results than tinting half of the entire film and producing a thoroughly blue movie, one that isn't any more atmospheric for it.<br /><br />In summary: it's not too bad, it's a thing of its time and place, if it weren't made, nobody would care, it can't touch the original and it makes for a nice summer viewing if you want a few scares. That is all.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>*** 2006. Directed by Irish born director John Moore and based on the same David Seltzer screenplay used for Richard Donner's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EYK4KS">The Omen (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a> in 1976. The American ambassador in London, without knowing it, is bringing up the son of you know whom. Good remake but what for and, most of all, for whom ? Already forgotten.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I was very excited when I heard about the remake.  The first Omen was great, and I wanted to see what new slant they would put on the movie for modern times.  Sadly, this is basically a scene by scene remake.  Aside from updated special effects and gore, there is nothing new in this movie.  I don't know why they even bothered.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>There is an interesting scene at the beginning of "The Omen" remake that involves a Catholic bishop's report to the dying Pope about the emergence of an antichrist. The bishop ticks off the signs - a comet, 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, that big tsunami - with a flashy slideshow, which he ends by saying "our worst fears have been confirmed." Now - why would this bishop have much fear?  Catholics believe the Book of Revelation is found in the Bible because it will happen - because it must - and it's no more to fear than the most obscure verses in Deuteronomy about the treatment of pus-filled scabs. Certainly the son of the devil is to be scorned and hated, but a Catholic bishop shouldn't exactly fear the inevitable unfolding of God's endgame; if anything, he should be solemnly glad that the new earth is near.<br /><br />You can think about these things because the first half of "The Omen" is a sprawling bore and the kid who plays antichrist Damien, Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick, is about as ominous as a Cabbage Patch doll. Couldn't director John Moore have found anybody else? Couldn't somebody have chopped Dakota Fanning's hair off, dyed it brown, and stuck her in there? The Pope's squirming in his velvet chair over a kid who has all of six lines and scowls by *literally protruding his lower lip.* The Dev' better have a plan B - this can't be the kid.<br /><br />But he is the boy British Ambassador Robert Thorn (Live Schreiber) took home the night his real son was killed by the Satanists. Wife Katherine (Julia Stiles) is the doomed mother who senses, by Damien's sixth birthday, that something is off about a mute boy who inspires nannies to hang themselves off the sides of castles and gorillas to go gonzo at the zoo. Robert brushes these things off as he wears all-black outfits to Katherine's elegant white robes and he ignores a psychotic priest (Pete Postlethwaite) who screams some demonic poem and the line: "His real mother was a jackal!" Do not think you shall be spared the shot of a jackal's skeleton in a shallow grave guarded by possessed black hellhounds. Oh, there will be a jackal's skeleton.<br /><br />This is a faithful remake of the original movie, which causes a lot of thirtysomethings to say "Ohhh, `The Omen,' oooo, that was so...oh my God!" without really expounding on the issue beyond, "Ohhh, Gregory Peck." That's because it wasn't any good either, and screenwriter David Selzer's idea has more traction than his writing of both pictures - the son of the devil, when he comes, isn't going to make this kind of ludicrous, swaggering entrance. The "Harry Potter" series, in fact, etches a more convincing origin story in its evolution of Voldemort. And a chilling movie was made about the birth of the antichrist; it's called "Rosemary's Baby," with Mia Farrow, who stars in "The Omen" as the evil nanny who stares longingly into Damien's eyes while she feeds him strawberries.<br /><br />It's right after this scene that Damien puts a sock in Katherine with his scooter, and Robert teams up with a photographer (David Thewlis) on a scavenger hunt that at least works better than "The DaVinci Code." A particular campy highlight is found at an ancient Italian monastery beyond a misty, snow-crusted lake where a deformed Satanic monk scrawls, in black coal, the location of a cemetery - but not before the church bells toll and we get a shot of Robert searching the walls for intruders. Later they meet a crazy sage (Michael Gambon) who hands Robert a leather pouch of daggers to kill Damien. Robert, who in an earlier scene says "I want Damien dead," has fourth thoughts. But the photographer is more than willing.<br /><br />Which leads to another question: When somebody is decapitated while standing, would their remaining body pause for a moment, slouch, then fall - or would they just drop immediately? My wife asked me this directly after "The Omen." It was her first impression.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z379ES750ZRY.html">A2Z379ES750ZRY</a><br/><p>I'm not sure what the point of this remake is - other than to cash in on 6/62006.  There is no point of remaking scene for scene a classic movie, if almost all of those schenese are going to be substandard when compared to the original.  Atleast give us a creative re-interpretation to give a different perspective.<br /><br />Other than the opening scene which is not in the original movie, the rest of the movie is quite mediocre.  The worst of it is the Damien character and his forced "evil" look - how shallow -in the original the boy is portrayed as completely normal whereas in the remake Damien seems totally self aware of his evilness".<br />I liked the ambiguity of the original.<br /><br />Beautifully filmed...although the use of the "symbolic" red through seems a bit cheesy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This 1981 film is the second sequel to the oustanding, 1976 gothic thriller "The Omen". The Antichrist, Damien Thorn (Sam Neill), is now all grown up and, having inherited the entire family maga fortune, is now in the process of fulfilling both his destiny and a biblical prophecy of calamitous proportions. Unfortunately for him, however, his very existence is in jeopardy, as the second coming of Christ appears imminent.<br /><br />Damien is kept busy in this film. As Ambassador to England, as well as spiritual leader to a denizen of devil worshippers, he is the target of an assassination plot by a group of priests led by Father DeCarlo (Rossano Brazzi). Damien keeps busy thwarting his would be assassins, usually by consigning them to a brutal demise. He also carries on a romance that ends badly. Damien is very much aware of who he is and where his destiny lies. He is also hell bent on destroying the Christ child, as it is only by doing so that he can survive and fulfill his destiny.<br /><br />This is a relatively well acted film that suffers from a somewhat weak script. Sam Neill is well cast as the adult Damien, giving a powerful performance. Rossano Brazzi is excellent as Father DeCarlo, the priest determined to end the stranglehold that the Antichrist has on the world. Composer Jerry Goldsmith contributes to the gothic atmosphere of the film with his chillingly creepy, musical score, just as he did in "The Omen" and in the first sequel. Due to its weak script, however, the film pales in comparison to its predecessors.<br /><br />The DVD offers a commentary by the director, Graham Baker but little else by way of special features.

Cute-looking kid, but had the right look for the film to be believable as a bad boy.<br />  In this 2006 film, Harvey Stephens makes a cameo appearance as the first tabloid reporter to speak to Liev Schreiber and asks, "Was she on drugs, Ambassador?"<br />  Let me go out on a limb and say, if you have not seen the orignial <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004TS0G">The Omen</a> (1976), you probably will not know what the hell is going on.<br />  Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber) goes to the hospital on June 6 where his wife Katherine (Julia Stiles) has just given birth to a baby boy. Robert is told his baby has died. With the help of the priest, Robert accepts another baby boy that has no parents.  He never tells his wife that their son had died.  it stays a secret between the priest and Robert.<br />  By the time Damien is 6 years old (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick), he is already showing a spiteful side of himslef.  At his 6th birthday party, Damien celebrates his birthday in a big way at his father's mansion. Robert is now an Ambassador. A mysterious black german shepard watches from afar. Suddenly the nanny (Amy Huck) calls out to Damien to get his attention.  She jumps off the building with a noose around her neck and kills herself gladly in front of all the children.<br />  A photographer, Keith Jennings (david Thewlis) and Father Brennan (Pete Postlethwaite) both warn Robert Thorn of the evil surrounding him.<br />  A new nanny arrives, Mrs. Baylock (Mia Farrow) who wants to care for and protect Damien.  She is on the devil's side.<br /><br />  This film never brings across the evilness this nanny has as they did so effectively (with goosebumps) in the Richard Donner version of 1976.<br /><br />  By all means, please see the sequel to "The Omen which is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004TS0H">Damien: Omen II</a>.

Perhaps the most glaring discrepancy is with the acting.  In particular, Gregory Peck and Lee Remick were outstanding in their respective roles as Mr. and Mrs. Robert Thorn...you simply do not have this caliber of acting in the remake.  For all intents and purposes, the remake of "The Omen" fails to stack up to the original.  In fact, the remake almost follows the original movie in every way with a few minor deviations and superfluous additions, but the problem is that the original did it perfectly the first time around so there was no way to improve upon the original.  Still, it's a great story and is probably worth viewing if you have any interest in the subject matter.  However, with that being said, I highly recommend the original over this inferior remake.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LBG01YBSUP96.html">A2LBG01YBSUP96</a><br/><p>i cared so very little for these charactors that they couldnt die fast enough.this is a horrible movie and im fortunate enough to have rented this.in fact,i returned it the same day.<br /><br />side note.....stiles represented the spoiled rich wife to a tee.i cheered when she crash landed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Was a remake of the classic 1976 film necessary?  Not really.  Is this remake a good movie?  Yes.  As good as the original?  Almost.  In this updated version, our hellboy Damien returns and even though there's not a whole lot of difference between the two films, the movie still packs a dramatic punch.  If you've never seen the original, you'll enjoy this a little more than those of us who still remember Gregory Peck Lee Remick and Billie Whitelaw's chilling performances.  But to the new version's credit, the faithfulness to the original is what makes it worthwhile viewing for fans of the genre.<br /><br />Liev Schrieber and Julia Stiles are the parents of the little hellion; they don't bring the same kind of intensity Peck and Remick did, but they do okay for themselves; David Thewlis is David Warner-worthy; and Pete Postelthwaite as the doomed priest is impressive.  The deaths for the most part are staged as in the original, although they're a little more graphic.  Stiles' final scene doesn't pack the emotional wallop of Remick's demise in the original, but it works for this film.  Mia Farrow is very good as the nanny in a change of pace role, but her final showdown with Schrieber isn't as impressive as Peck and Whitelaw's confrontation.  The scene in the cemetary when they discover the jackal is hauntingly spooky, and the addition of snow on the ground adds to this terror.<br /><br />Overall, THE OMEN is a good remake, and even if you've seen the original, you should enjoy this one, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>What makes this newer version of 1976's "The Omen" so outstanding is that the producers wisely stuck pretty close to the original script that is nothing short of perfection. The original "Omen" has gone down in Hollywood as a classic so it was only a matter of time before it was remade for newer audiences. Another great thing about the remake is there are better production values in it including wonderful camera work, some new special effects, and innovative editing. The leads, however, are nowhere near as great as Lee Remick and Gregory Peck, but to their credit they do try their best. Mia Farrow is great as the nanny, but Billie Whitelaw who played Mrs. Baylock in the original, will always own the role as she displayed one of the best villins in 1970's cinema. I guess Mia, who I adore and love, just wasn't as scary as Whitelaw. I keep seeing Mia as the tormented Rosemary in "Rosemary's Baby" and Allison in "Peyton Place". Still, it was great to see Miss Farrow in a rare screen appearance.<br /> The DVD contains extended scenes and an extended ending, there is commentary by director John Moore, producer Glenn Williamson, and editor Dan Zimmerman. There is an informative featurette called "Revolution OOO".<br /> This version of "The Omen" is also included in a fantastic boxset that includes all "The Omen" films that are usually reasonably priced.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>Richard Donner's 1976 film "The Omen" is one of the creepiest films ever made. That filmed offered chills, thrills, great music by Jerry Goldsmith, and fine performances by the likes of Gregory Peck and others. With Donner's fantastic direction, the original remains a classic that will stand the test of time.<br /><br />John Moore's remake of "The Omen" is everything that Donner's film was, and therein lies the problem. Moore's film changes very little from the original script, so scenes that were once chilling are now cliche. All he does is add a little more gore to the mix, which doesn't help much at all. There are maybe one or two good "jump" scenes here, but that's it.<br /><br />The cast does an OK job. David Thewlis and Julia Stiles are actually better in their respective roles than David Warner and Lee Remick were in the original, but that's it. Mia Farrow tries to be creepy, but Billie Whitelaw was more chilling as Damien's nanny. The kid playing Damien does the exact same thing the original kid did, which makes the character less chilling, though the fact that he looks like a young version of Adolph Hitler does give him a bit of a creepy look.<br /><br />To me, Liev Schreiber was ineffective as Thorne. He's no Gregory Peck, though he tries very hard to sound like him in several scenes. He's a good actor, but this rolle was not suited for him. Peter Postlethwaite did an OK job as Father Brennan, but Patrick Troughton (The Second Doctor of TV's "Doctor Who") was much better in the role.<br /><br />Overall, Moore's remake of "The Omen" is your average horror film package, with few chills, and a predictable plot. If you want to see a chilling horror film, then view Donner's original classic. As for this film, I recommend it only to horror-film lovers.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: C</p></br><a href="../users/A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ.html">A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ</a><br/><p>The Omen follows a woman named Katherine Thorn (Julia Stiles) who delivers a stillborn child.  Her husband Robert (Liev Schreiber) knows this, and without consulting her first, switches the stillborn with another baby.  They name the child Damien (as in demon).  At Damien's (4th) birthday [party], their nanny commits suicide by hanging herself by the house, saying aloud it's "all for you [Damien]"  After that incident, another woman is `hired' to be the new nanny.  I didn't like this nanny, and I think she was really the bad one, instead of Damien.  Anyways, one day all three of them (mom, dad, and Damien) are on their way to church.  Approaching the church, Damien gets nervous and feverish.  When they arrive at the church, Damien throws a big fit.  Okay, if I was there, I'd think something was really messed up with my child, and I would have him checked out by a doctor as soon as possible!!  Another incident is when Katherine takes Damien and a bunch of other kids to the zoo.  Damien goes to see the monkeys by himself, while the other kids go in separate directions.  The monkeys notice Damien and are afraid.  The big gorilla suddenly tries to break through the glass (I guess to try and kill Damien).  After that unpleasant incident, Katherine thinks there is something really wrong with her son.  She sees a therapist for this.  When Katherine falls from the top floor of her house, she winds up in the hospital.  She isn't dead, but she's badly injured.  When she `mysteriously' dies one day, and Robert finds out, he takes immediate action.  It's up to him now to kill his son, otherwise who knows who else will die.<br /><br />This is an exact replica of the original!  I don't remember, though, that ugly-faced guy Robert was questioning, to be in the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>This is not a good movie.<br /><br />Forget it's a remake, forget the original, forget that the concept of Hell-On-Earth has been done to death already in movies like 'The Exorcist', 'Rosemary's Baby', 'Silent Hill', and so forth. And, without all of those things to measure this effort against, 'Omen 666' still manages to be a dismal, overblown tack-fest of enormous proportions.<br /><br />The movie opens with some flashy, glitzy documentary-style shots of actual, real disasters, like 9/11 and the New Orleans flooding. Far from underlining the proposed message at the beginning of the movie - that man is contributing to his own downfall - these shots are a cheap, tawdry attempt to pull the viewer in to gain some sort of empathy with what the (it must be said) not-terribly-worried-looking Vatican Cardinals are foreseeing. I don't know about you but I'd prefer to show these disasters a little respect, not dress them up and gloss them over to serve the bland ends of movies like this one.<br /><br />The glossy, overawed sense of self-importance continues with some of the more pivotal scenes in the movie - the decapitation scene, the first time we're supposed to wonder what Damien's power is actually capable of, looks here, thanks to some Arnold-Schwarzenegger-Versus-Steven-Segal style direction, like something from a bad action flick. Damien's birthday party, the zoo sequence and the death of Father Brennan all suffer from the same waaaay over-the-top flashiness, and this simply removes all the dramatic worth of the scene, because we've seen all this done so, so many times before.<br /><br />Performance-wise there's not much on offer: Julia Stiles is a good actress, but she's out of her depth here. She doesn't seem capable of generating either the sympathy or the humanity needed for her character. Pete Postlethwaite stinks (really, REALLY stinks - I was very disappointed: he sounds like a drunken St. Patrick's Day reveller instead of a priest who knows Armageddon is at hand) and David Thewlis just looks bored. Ditto Mia Farrow: a great casting choice to play the malevolent Mrs. Blayloch, Farrow's lack of screen time and the inclusion of her 'campier' moments turn Mrs. Blayloch into something of a Light Relief. Liev Schreiber does a pretty good job as Robert Thorn, but the subtleties of his performance are lost to a less-than-average supporting cast and some truly boring, boring direction. The same can be said for Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick, who, while initially doing a good job in the role of Damien, proceeds to slap a constipated expression on his face for the latter two-thirds of the picture, and winds up eventually at Not Very Scary At All.<br /><br />This movie is not even recommended for a DVD rental, being so wholly unoriginal and over-the-top. The mawkish quality of the visuals and the frankly substandard direction are thrown into relief by the fact that director John Moore clearly thought he could add some visual frills to the style and pacing of the original movie and come up with something decent. He hasn't, and what we're left with in 'Omen 666' is a pretty feeble rendition of a potentially gripping story.<br /><br />Avoid.</p></br><a href="../users/A391YPR0NFTCLK.html">A391YPR0NFTCLK</a><br/><p>The best way to enjoy these recent remakes is to just disregard the original. Im not saying to forget them, of course not. The orginal film from 1976 is a classic. Its part of the un-holy triolgy of demonic horror films from the 70s (The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, and The Omen) no one can forget those. But as your watching the new version just get caught up in the story. Dont be so harsh.<br /><br />I love the original and I liked the remake. Its very faithful and equally creepy. The acting is good all around. The directing stands out overall, very stylish and sets a very strong mood. Watch out for a sinister Mia Farrow as Mrs. Baylock. This is also a good movie for people who havent seen the original. They will enjoy it. Regardless of what you think of the remake its nice to see a smart and creepy slow boil religious horror movie back on the big screen. On its own, The Omen 2006 is a good movie. Not a great one, but a very enjoyable and creepy film. Dont judge it to harshly just because you liked the original. Simply enjoy this for what it is.<br /><br />If you havent seen the original and this is your first experience with religious thrillers films check out the ultimatly better original film, The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, The Da Vinci Code, The Exorcism of Emily Rose and The Name of the Rose.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>This is probably the most obvious film to remake  when the release  date is July 6, 2006, a date chosen before the film was done.<br /><br />Overall the film is very Good, when seen on its own  and in no  way comparing it to the original.Mia Farrow, Michael Gambon and David Thewlis are excellent in their  respective roles; Mia being suitably diabolical, and Gambon exceedingly excessive.<br /><br />The extras are fun too, and very enlightening, especially the Black Friday event. The promise of other Omen remakes is nice, especially if they pick more intense actors.<br /><br />Sadly, if comparing this  film to the 1976 original is done, well, the original is a gem. What should also have been done is a Re-Release of the original with Punched up audio, cleaned up Video, and enhanced everything.<br /><br />The original Omen Films are still master works. A pity that the casting was not on the same par.<br /><br />However, I did enjoy the film, Missed on the release  date, but happily purchased with a suitably Cool Iron Maiden  special edition.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>For my 666 review I decided to take on the remake of `The Omen' which could turn itself into a horrible mistake for anyone who's the slightest bit superstitious, but luckily I'm not even remotely so I'll sleep more than fine tonight.<br /><br />This remake has received an awful lot of flak right off the bat for following a pattern similar to that of the 1998 `Psycho' remake, following the original script almost to the T raising the question, `why make a remake if it's shot for shot the original?'  Well, to answer that question it's for money.  A glossy new remake, regardless if the dialog is identical, will at least look far better than any film made in the 70's and in that respect `The Omen' succeeds with flying colors (one reviewer even mentioned his love of the colors used in this film and with that I must concur).<br /><br />As far as the complaint that young Fitzpatrick isn't quite scary enough, come on, we can't all be as creepy as say Cameron Bright (who I wish was younger and could have tackled this role...that kid is so freaking creepy).  But regardless, little Davey does a decent job at playing possessed.  Better suited for her role was the original Rosemary herself Mia Farrow who was excellently cast and proved to be the biggest highlight of the film.  As far as parents Stiles and Schreiber are concerned, I actually feel they deserve props for this, especially Julia who plays the troubled mother perfectly.  I really wish she would get the role of a lifetime that really takes her over the edge of stardom.  She's certainly talented enough.<br /><br />So bottom line is, while so many have already pointed out the un-necessity of this film, `The Omen' delivers enough scares and enough solid acting to warrant a watch through, and while it's not perfect and it may not be better than the original, it's no worse.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>First of all, I'm not much of a fan of the original, which is slow and turgid and often teeters on the edge of boredom.  There's not enough wrong with it for me to dislike it, but there's not enough good about it to make me like it either.  It stands in no-man's land.  The remake is much more fun, though it suffers from some of the same concerns, such as uneven pacing and a basic plot that just isn't that hot.  How, you might rightly ask, does the remake manage to be much more entertaining than the original despite following it incredibly closely?  Well... it's tough to say.  The budget plays a big part in it, honestly.  Watching people sit around, or wander around to different locales is a lot more appealing when you can make it look really good in the process.  It's also helped, somewhat, by the performances.  Mia Farrow is fun and over the top as the creepy nanny.  The colder performance in the original was fine in and of itself, but this goofier turn adds a bit of life to the film.  Furthermore, the central character of Robert Thorn is much better this time around.  This isn't to say Schreiber gives a great performance; he's merely okay, a little dull, frankly.  But his turn worked much better than Peck's original did, as Peck made Thorn into a pompous buffoon whom I actively disliked. (Peck also managed to overact without actually conveying any emotion.  That's quite a feat.)  I don't feel an overwhelming amount of sympathy for this Thorn, but not hating him does help the film, as he is the protagonist and all. (And, as the film goes along and things get worse and worse I did start to sympathize with him a bit.)  Some Seamus kid plays Damien, and he's been much criticized, and not without some reason.  One of the relative strengths of the original was that it didn't try and make Damien be all scary and evil, what with that being a pretty tall order for a little kid.  Here Seamus mostly just glowers, umm, evilly, and he is something less than terrifying.  It coulda been worse, though, and he doesn't get too much screen time.  Julia Stiles takes over the role of Kate Thorn, and she has an extraordinarily round and squishy looking face.  I didn't notice too much else about her. (I must say, however, that her performance was not conspicuously bad, as I anticipated it might be.)<br /><br />Also of note is Pete Postelthwaite as one of the various crazy priests, Father Brennan.  It's the standard Postelthwaite role, twitchy and creepy and overdone, but I've always liked it before, and he continues to entertain me now.  Lastly, though he doesn't do much, I couldn't help but mention the appearance of Italian horror veteran Giovanni Lombardo Radice as another priest.  I hate to be the guy who gets interested when some smalltime actor from obscure, forgotten film randomly shows up in something big unexpectedly, but his appearance did amuse me.  This time around Radice gets his face melted, though we don't actually see it happen on screen...<br /><br />Again, this is a big-budget affair, particularly for a horror film, coming in with a budget 30 times greater than that of the original.  It's all up their on the screen, and the film looks great.  Sorry folks, but the money does help a lot.  Take, for example, the graveyard scene.  The scene is pretty much the same in both versions in terms of content, but the new one is still multitudes better because it actually looks good, as they had the time and money to find an appropriately ominous setting.  This could be said of most of the film, as a matter of fact.  It's an odd combination really, the somewhat silly plot and often wacky performances combine with an ultra-sharp look, making this film classy and hokey at the same time.  Also reducing the hokiness factor somewhat is the absence of the lame gothic sounding music of the original.  What they replaced it with is undistinguished, but at least it doesn't hurt the film.<br /><br />The various death scenes, like most of the rest of the film, are largely the same, aside from the sharper visual style.  This isn't uniformly true however, as their is a bit of not so great CGI work, but there ain't much of it overall.  Most notably, the decapitation scene has been reworked to some degree.  Nowadays a decap isn't liable to impress anyone too much, but it is pretty well done, anyway.  The impalation was the best death the first time around, I thought, and it's pretty cool here too.  Probably the best one.  It does have a bit of the aforementioned unfotunate CGI, but it makes up for it in other ways.<br /><br />I should note that this film isn't scary in the least.  There are a few slightly creepy moments in some of the modern, surrealist dream sequences, but that's it.  I don't mind, I don't particularly go to horror movies to be scared, I mostly just like the style and conventions of the genre, but it's worth mentioning.  It does have some effective jump scares, however.  Now, I'm opposed to that sorta thing, I've never really understood the point, but I can't deny that they're quite well done here, as far as jump scares are concerned.  If you're the kinda person who is susceptible to that kinda scare you'll likely jump through the damn roof.<br /><br />All that said, I'm not really sure who the audience for this film is.  Horror aficionados will, for the most part, dislike it for the modern aspects, and hate it for being a remake.  And I dunno if it'll appeal to stupid teenagers too much either, probably finding it too slow (as I did, frankly) and moody.  (It does make some concessions to the newer style of horror, but I don't think enough to win most of them over.)  Nevertheless, I thought it was fun, if far from remarkable.  So I guess you gotta be like me, having a taste for both modern and 70's style horror (the golden age of horror films, if ever there was one), and a sufficient affection for the genre to take the good aspects of the film while not being especially bothered by the bad parts.  If you can do that, you'll probably have a good time.<br /><br />Grade: B-</p></br><a href="../users/A3AY3EV2MFRFGG.html">A3AY3EV2MFRFGG</a><br/><p>While Damien Thorn, the Anti-Christ itself, now fully grown and a powerful political figure and businessman, is preparing to dominate the world, as it is prophesized somewhere in the bible, the daggers buried under the rubble of the Chicago Museum of Natural History at the climax of Omen 2 are found.  During an excellent opening credit sequence, we follow the daggers of Megiddo from a pawn shop, across the world, and into the hands of a group of Monks who have been patiently waiting for such an opportunity to be given to them.  Everything after that is rather listless, the 'accident' strewn plot enlivened only by a sorely underdeveloped romance of sorts between Damien and a television reporter.  The 'final' conflict itself is really anti-climatic, but Damien does get a great parting shot of a line.<p>The Final Conflict offers a few good things, namely a wonderful debut performance by Sam Neil as Damien and another excellent score by Jerry Goldsmith.  The photography is atmospheric and some of the death scenes are show stoppingly energetic, but that does not a good movie make.  On the negative side we have Damien Thorn, Evil Incarnate and out to Rule the World, then destroy it, who turns out to be far too boring of a one dimensional character to build a film around.  He has no conflict within himself and, outside of that pesky squad of monk assassins, he really has no outside conflict in which to engage him.  The previous movies worked better when focusing on a different character that finds out what Damien is and must then grapple with his/her own human doubt as well as the forces of evil.  Also fans hoping for a huge, global, fate of the world in the balance battle as a climax will be sorely disappointed, it is not to be found.  Worth seeing only for Sam Neil's performance and Goldsmith's score, but not for any kind of attempt at satisfying closure.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>The third in the Omen series is only notable for the Jerry Goldsmith score which is a natural extension of the the first two.

I don't know what to say when in fact that there is no such thing as plagiarism in Hollywood these days. The remake of The Omen is a lot like the remake of Psycho minus the masturbation scene, and comparing both of them, even though the latter got a rating of `1', the remake of Psycho was better. Watching this turd, The Omen remake is predictably boring because of two reasons: I already saw the original plenty of times (and it was almost word-for-word and I remember it all and there is no fun in it) and nothing seemed to be human about it. There is no creation of real emotion or suspense. It was just fake...fake...fake. Instead of paying the admission price of seeing her to act in anything, I rather want see Julia Stiles be given a Chinese torture. I have a hard time believing in her face because she looks exactly like a teenager in an adult role. Who was the loser that said that Liev Schreiber can play the lead actor? Mia Farrow, your career is officially over. John Moore thought that he was directing a horror flick but instead fails to know what constitutes one. There is an excessive use of thunder throughout the picture, and higher emphasis is placed on the thought of "the gorier, the better." Well, if I must complain, the original, I know it wasn't a great movie, is thousands times better than the remake, and why bother doing a remake when the original had done it already?

They even brought the original screenwriter on board to update his own script.  They assembled a very talented cast that holds its own, especially Liev Shrieber.

(A line not from the original).<br /><br />Casting Mia Farrow from ROSEMARY'S BABY as the demonic maid was brilliant.<br /><br />I wasn't so wild about the kid, to be honest, but he's more of a symbol than an actual role and the story is how everyone reacts to him.  His eyes were intense enough that he might have been more effective if kept a blank look instead of trying to look like the son of the devil.  Just a thought.<br /><br />At first I was disappointed that they didn't use Jerry Goldsmith's original Oscar-winning "black mass" score...but then I admired the film for having its own soundtrack.<br /><br />Now that all the die-hard fans of the original have hopefully calmed down from slamming the mere thought of remaking THE OMEN, give this one a chance.<br /><br />This is how a remake should be made.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>Although THE OMEN and DAMIEN: THE OMEN II are scary films, as a Christian, this one is by far the best in the series. Even though it is not 100% Biblically accurate, I felt that the Bible's message was represented accurately, and it does seem to follow Biblical prophecy very well. My favorite thing about the film is the ending, where Jesus returns &quot;not as a child, but as King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.&quot; Sam Neill played Damien Thorne with scary realism and exciting presence. The only thing that could've been kept out was the sex scene (even though it's not as bad as the scenes in HIGHLANDER: THE FINAL DIMENSION and HIGHLANDER: ENDGAME).

These were all mostly chilling films and they do what sequels are supposed to do and that is continue a storyline and not keep repeating the original.  Here is my take on each film:<br /><br />Omen (1976) ***** - Still one of my all time favorite films horror or not.  The Academy Award-winning score by Jerry Goldsmith is still very haunting as is the rest of this film.  Time has not altered the effectiveness of this great chiller which is enhance by great acting, notably by Greg Peck and Lee Remick, direction and cinematography.  Nothing shows age with this film.<br /><br />Omen (2006) *** - An unnecessary remake, but a decent one all the same with a good cast.  It does lack the haunting images and feel of the original and probably a good example of leave well enough alone.<br /><br />Omen II (1978) ***1/2 - A well-crafted sequel that cleverly continues the story which is what a sequel should do.  Damien is growing up and learning of his heritage, power, and potential future and unexpectedly struggles with this much like any teen-ager growing up.  The storyline is very convincingly continued here.  It's not nearly as haunting and chilling as the original, but it does stand well up against it.  Superior acting and an intelligent script save this film from being a typical sequel.  While it is predicatable most of the time, the director keeps things moving swiftly.  Good popcorn fun, but with a little more substance than most of its genre.<br /><br />Omen III (1981) **** - The world is introduced to Damien, now an adult and seeking world domination through his company and followers, and we as an audience are introduced to a great actor, Sam Neil (Jurassic Park), in his first starring role.  I was greatly impressed with this sequel and Neil's powerful performance filled with chilling charm and menacing arrogance.  This film got under my skin more the Omen II, but still less so than the original film.  My major criticism with this film is the ending which has several VERY long passages to read at the end in a font and size that is difficult to read.  Thank God for the freeze frame function.  Live audiences must have went nuts trying to read this in the theater and if they missed it, they'd have to stay to see it again to read faster.  Overall, it was a very effective conclusion to the Omen series.<br /><br />Omen IV (1991) **1/2 - Hey, didn't I just say conclusion in the last review?  Well, sort of.  This "sequel" is entertaining to a degree, but it does what all too many sequels tend to do and that is rehash the original and contradict it as well (much like "The Grudge 2").  This film is one of those it's so bad it's kind of good (but not that good).  This is an example of Hollywood trying to save a money-making franchise, but they are fresh out of good ideas to continue the storyline.  Heck, after killing Satan's son in Omen III, that kind of closed the door on things --duh!  It's an oddball film that is mildly entertaining, but very pale in comparison to the series' prior efforts.<br /><br />This whole collection is well worth owning.  I can't imagine any horror fans letting this series slip by them.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a decent re-make of a first class, gothic chiller. It is not, however, as creepy as the 1976 original, which starred Gregory Peck and Lee Remick, as it lacks Jerry Goldsmith's pulse pounding musical score. It also has a younger cast that lacks the gravitas of the original. Still, the film is still worth viewing, if only to see how it fares in comparison to the original, especially as the screenplay used appears to be the original one.<br /><br />Katherine (Julia Stiles) and Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber) are a young, affluent American couple. Katherine is pregnant and, while in Italy, gives birth to an ostensibly stillborn boy, a fact that is kept from her. Knowing how much his wife wanted the baby and the difficulty that she had in conceiving, Robert agrees to have the dead baby supplanted by a living newborn whose mother died in child birth, keeping this information from Katherine. They name this baby Damien.<br /><br />All goes well for the prosperous Thorn family, until Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) turns five. A series of dramatic, unusual events begin to occur around the Thorns, all seemingly stemming from Damien. Well guarded by a somewhat creepy nanny (Mia Farrow), there are those who would believe him to be the Antichrist. By the time that Katherine and Robert begin to realize who Damien may truly be, their lives are out of control. With the aid of an inquisitive photographer, a repentant priest, and an mysterious man who holds the key to the destruction of the Antichrist, Robert Thorn becomes a man with a mission. Will Damien let him complete that mission? Watch this movie and find out.<br /><br />Both Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles give credible performances, though they are no Gregory Peck or Lee Remick. Mia Farrow, as the nanny with a diabolical mission, gives a fine and genuinely creepy performance, aided in part by what appears to be a pair of collagen enhanced lips. The rest of the supporting cast is also excellent.  While this re-make pales in comparison to the original, it is still enjoyable and worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>A remake is a tough thing to consider....<br /><br />Does one stay faithful to the original -or- try to revamp the film with something new to offer ?<br /><br />There is another important thing to consider, SOME FILMS DON'T NEED A REMAKE!<br /><br />The OMEN like PSYCHO is one of those films that can stand on it's own and had no need for a remake (like Led Zepplin's STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN).<br /><br />There is NOTHING a studio could do to win in this situation, although it appears they did make $$$ on this clunker.<br /><br />And of course we all understand film making is a business first and art second.<br /><br />However, all that aside, this remake of OMEN got off to a bad start with poor casting, bland performances and basically came across as FLAT.<br /><br />It almost seems the whole crew from actors to director were almost embarassed and ashamed to be remaking this film.<br /><br />It just gave that feeling when watching it.<br /><br />I was almost tempted to pull out the original and watch them side-by-side at the same time because unless I am mistaken the dialoge and scenes seem IDENTICAL as thought the exact 1970s shooting script was used for this remake.<br /><br />Watching this DVD (before we ejected it about 60 minutes in) was like looking at a polaroid picture of a beautiful woman as compared to having the real thing standing inches in front of you.<br /><br />The remake was just flat and lifeless.<br /><br />It would be more fun to see Hollywood do remakes of movies that had potential the first time, but failed.... to see if they can rework them and make a better film the second time.<br /><br />1975's DOC SAVAGE comes to mind.<br /><br />It was an early version of what Indiana Jones later became and SHOULD have been good since it was based on a popular 1930's pulp here.<br /><br />Instead the film was campy and died at the box office.<br /><br />It would be good for example to see a film like that done properly.</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>It appears that remaking The Omen is a double edged sword; if it strays too much from the original then people will boo and if it's too close then they will be unhappy as well. I totally left all that I knew about it at home and gave my all to the story that was both creepy and modern in John Moore's version of the Anti-Christ "reborn" in a man, or should I say little boys flesh.<br /><br />I loved the color schemes of the whole movie with the dark cloudy weather, the gray and beige castle that the Thorns called home and splashes of red used to provoke memories of danger lurking ahead, such classic ways to spice up a story that was really captivating with unreal flashbacks to nightmares, blood and hooded demons that crept up the lives of an innocent pair. The story is well known to those familiar but in brief description to the curious I will divulge a super quick summary.<br /><br />In Rome an American diplomat an his wife, Robert and Katherine Thorn welcome a baby boy  to their world, but little do they know about the origins of that baby. Katherine supposingly had a very difficult delivery that resulted in death of the child and unknowns to her, a priest at the hospital offers Robert a baby boy whose mother died in childbirth at the same time that Katherine was in her labor. Robert takes the baby boy, pretends that it is theirs because it was all his wife ever wanted and they go on from there only to meet death and destruction for what seemed like a saved situation. The movie follows the boy, Damien who starts to show strange behavior starting with his 6th birthday party and that's when things go form bad to worse.<br /><br />I will agree that the original Damian was both melancholy and menacing with his cold silver blue eyes, and was much better than Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick who did some good smirks and threw a fit when close to a church, but I didn't let that one thing spoil my movie.<br /><br />I loved watching people jump in their seats and scream out, it made me laugh, only because if I'm going to see a horror movie, I know better than let things slip out of me like that, and I enjoyed seeing others have a reaction that horror movies makes us crave. Overall this was very good, and I liked Liev Schreiber, Mia Farrow and even Julian Styles, who did much better than I expected and certain scenes such as the one in the cemetery with the falling snow were really well done. The death scenes were ultra gruesome because they were so realistic but they just gave this movie more depth. I enjoyed this and I'm really looking forward to seeing what unravels from where the story leaves, for I know more gruesome yummies are on the way.</p></br><a href="../users/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ.html">A22BPC7LRSGSYQ</a><br/><p>Read other reviews for a description of the plot, because...<br /><br />Last night a friend of mine, who loves this movie, said, "Remember that one part in The Omen 3.......blah blah blah...wasn't that a good scene?"  I said, "I've never seen that movie."  He said, "Yes you have.  I brought it over that one time."  I said, "When?"  He said, "Like maybe two years ago."  I still didn't remember it.  Then he began to describe it more.  Then I suddenly vaguely remembered the movie.  I said, "Oh yeah...I think I remember now.  That was like in February 2009 when you brought that over.  Yeah, I didn't like that movie.  That's why I forgot all about it.  It's a forgettable movie.  It didn't stick with me."<br /><br />The above paragraph sums up my feelings about this movie.  It was so lousy, boring, and not scary that I ended up forgetting that I even saw it.

There is the requisite mumbo jumbo, garroting, beheading and such: most of it done on a very high level of ingenuity and gut-level, sickening brutality.<br />Acting wise the main problems are the limp, emotionless, icy Katherine Thorn of Julia Stiles and the seemingly clueless, poorly directed and woefully miscast anti-Christ Damien of Fitzpatrick. And when the child of the Devil is boring in a film about itself, what have we got?</p></br><a href="../users/ACMAUJEBY6GJF.html">ACMAUJEBY6GJF</a><br/><p>...,but is that a good thing? According to a lot of reviewers here and around the globe, well, not exactly.<br /><br />2006s' "The Omen" is not a bad movie. It's not horrible, worst movie ever, embarrassing or anything close to that. But compared to the original (and many will compare these two versions being that the original is legendary, perhaps one of the best horror-movies ever made) it is ironically "doomed"!<br /><br />So I agree to that there's not much of a point remaking the exact same story to the screen. A few minor changes perhaps, but surprisingly few new surprises. A couple of unpleasant scenes, but the atmosphere of the original is missing throughout the entire picture. The music sounds like John Williams' "Jaws Theme", not bad -but why? Too similar. The boy acting Damien looks too much like the son of the devil. Not much of a disguise here. But that little boy in "The Ring" actually looks far more scary. And he's not even evil. So I didn't care too much for the casting.<br /><br />It's like the entire crew knew that this was never to become anything close to the original? So why bother?<br /><br />But if you haven't seen the original, who knows? I was entertained, not many surprises as mentioned as I couldn't stop comparing the two. But I'm an old fan, and this is a new movie. There's nothing wrong in the filmmaking, epic camera work, interesting locations. All in all an ok movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>When the son of Deputy Ambassador Thorn (Liev Schreiber) dies at birth in an Italian hospital, a helpful priest convinces him to take another baby and not tell his wife Kate (Julia Stiles) about the switch.  Five years later, Thorn is US Ambassador to England, Kate still hasn't bonded with little Damien, and people start dying all around the family.<br /><br />If I hadn't seen the 1976 "Omen," I probably would have found this version OK, but I am a fan of the original and this one pales in comparison.  With the exception David Thewlis, who gives a good performance as the photographer, all of the actors come up short, mostly because they were miscast.  Stiles is too young and model-pretty to be believable; her face bore no signs of anguish or fear.  Schrieber looks the part, but no one could match Gregory Peck for style, subtlety, and maturity.  The child who plays Damien looks evil throughout the movie; his  exaggerated scowls are tiring.  Mia Farrow as the nanny is too pretty and cheerful; she needed Billie Whitelaw's chilling gothic presence.<br /><br />Both versions have the same plot, but this one seemed tedious and overlong; the only spookiness comes from sudden, loud noises.  The first "Omen" had a memorable musical score that caused goosebumps all by itself; this time around the music is loud and overwhelming, but not scary.  The location photography and big-budget production values are nice, but all in all, 2006's "Omen" is forgettable.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CZPM110DW516.html">A2CZPM110DW516</a><br/><p>A surprisingly effective remake of the 1976 occult thriller, "The Omen" is something of an improvement on the overrated original. For one, the acting is better. Liev Schreiber doesn't have Gregory Peck's dignified stoicism, but is more capable of expressing genuine fear and anguish, qualities more appropriate for a man who comes to realize he's playing daddy to the Antichrist. Julia Stiles is sympathetic as his wife, and Pete Postelthwaite is superb as the guilt-ridden priest determined to warn Schreiber of his son's true identity. And, in the role of the evil nanny, the casting of Mia Farrow, who unwittingly gave birth to Satan's son in the vastly superior "Rosemary's Baby," is inspired.<br /><br />Director John Moore provides a mood that's eerier and more foreboding than the original, and, predictably, lays on the gore in ways that weren't possible thirty years earlier. The suicide by hanging, the most disturbing moment in Richard Donner's original, is memorably restaged, while the impaling and beheading that shocked audiences in 1976 are more graphic. Those who can't get enough of this kind of stuff should be happy with the DVD "extras" which include extended versions of the most violent scenes.<br /><br />It's been years since I saw the original, so I don't recall if it included a poem foretelling the coming of the Antichrist, but whenever it was recited here, I wondered if someone was attempting to pay homage to 1941's "The Wolfman" ("Even a man who is pure at heart, and says his prayers by night...").<br /><br />Brian W.

Go and rent the original 1976 version and watch it.  It is not as good as we thought it was when it first appeared on the big screen."<br /><br />In this new version, Liev Schreiber is near perfect as a Robert Thorn, a man who finds himself climbing the ladder of success faster than even he can comprehend.  He may have underplayed his part a slight bit, but his role still works.<br /><br />Julia Stiles turns in a fantastic performance as Katherine Thorn, a woman torn between unconditional love for her child and hating the little devil!<br /><br />This newer version of the first Omen is better because it uses shock you out of your seat scenes to make it seem like a horror-coaster!  People really need to get over the whole "they just can't remake films as good as the original" mentality.  This film passes the original in every way.<br /><br />Gregory Peck was like a robot on screen in the original movie.  Now I'm not saying Schreiber was as animated as a Muppet on steroids, but I believe he showed a bit more pizzazz as things began to spin more out of control in the Thorn household.<br /><br />The music, special effects, timing of scary scenes and general filming are better in this 2006 version.  But both films rely on scary music and some gory death scenes to make this film a success.<br /><br />Ignore the critics.

"The Omen"--originally released in 1976 and directed by Richard Donner--was a film I found to be quite overblown, the story and characterizations stretched a little too thin to do justice to the idea behind it. Now, thirty years later, we have John Moore's remake. I had my doubts going into the theater because I knew it was reinterpreting something that wasn't very good to begin with. But for whatever reason, this new version works. At least, it works for me. At first I couldn't understand why; this is a very faithful adaptation of a baffling film, and because of that, I expected this to be equally as disappointing.<br /><br />I have to admit that it was an entertaining reinterpretation. Unfortunately, the story had nothing to do with why I liked it; I think it had more to do with the film's style. It relied on pure atmosphere and mood to convey the impending terror that occurs. There are many moments encased in shadow, most of which are only lit by the occasional flash of lightening. We also get to look inside an open grave in Rome, a scene accentuated by snowy, dismally gray weather. Most importantly, we get subtle yet significant character expressions, most of which come from Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick), the young but not innocent Devil incarnate. There's a moment when he's in a dimly lit kitchen fixing himself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. When his mother, Katherine (Julia Stiles), enters the room, he gives her one of the creepiest stares I've ever seen a child give.<br /><br />It also helped that most of the famous scenes from the original were brought back. These include Katherine falling from the upstairs landing, a priest getting impaled, and a nanny who inexplicably hangs herself. ("It's all for you, Damien!" she shouts before jumping from the roof of the Thorns' sprawling London estate. No matter how hard I try, I still can't figure out why she did it or exactly what was all for him.) Even some of Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar winning score finds its way into the remake. I suppose those of you devoted to the original film will find this troublesome, maybe even blasphemous (pardon the pun). When it comes to remakes, there's always been a fine line between a genuine update and an unimaginative rehash. Whether or not "The Omen" actually crosses that line is open for debate.<br /><br />That's because, despite the new cast and the impressive cinematography, the basic story is exactly the same. It beings when U.S. ambassador to Italy Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber) arrives at the hospital to be by his pregnant wife's side (apparently, she went into a rather difficult labor). He runs into Father Spiletto (Giovanni Lombardo Radice) when he arrives, and the priest gives him the bad news: the baby did not survive the delivery and Katherine will most likely never again be able to bear children. This is more than just devastating for Robert, it also puts extra pressure on him; Katherine still doesn't know what's happened, and now, he has to be the one to tell her. But Spiletto gives him another option. Another child was born that day, a boy whose mother tragically died during childbirth. As an added bonus, he has no other living family members. (Does the word "convenient" come to mind?) Robert decides to bring the boy to his wife and tell her that they have a beautiful new son who they name Damien.<br /><br />Everything goes smoothly for the family over the next five or so years. Then things start to go wrong when Robert's colleague--Ambassador Steven Haines (Marshall Cup)--is killed in an accident involving a leaking gas truck and a discarded cigarette (I'm sure you can imagine what happens). But life goes on, and the Thorns eventually move from Italy to London, taking residence in an obscenely large gothic mansion. For a short while, things continue to go smoothly. Then comes Damien's birthday, an almost gala event that brings scores of children and even larger scores of photographers. It also happens to be the same day when Damien's young nanny (Amy Huck) performs her suicidal stunt.<br /><br />And that's when everything starts to go downhill. The search for a new nanny yields the unexpected finding of Mrs. Baylock (Mia Farrow), a seemingly friendly but somehow sinister woman who takes an uncomfortable liking to Damien. She also defies the authority of his parents, especially when it comes to keeping a mean spirited stray dog in the house. Strangely enough, this behavior made her a confusing character. I was bothered by the fact that I never really got a chance to know her; she just appears out of nowhere, and even though we know what her real intentions are, we don't know why she has them. I can only speculate that she belongs to some kind of opposing factor that sent her to the Thorns.<br /><br />Still, she does add a much-needed dose of tension into the story (especially in the scene when she hand feeds Damien strawberries; talk about tense). But Mrs. Baylock is only the start of the family's problems. Katherine eventually beings to notice certain things about Damien, things that other children don't seem to have to deal with. For one, she realizes that he's never once gotten sick, despite having a typically non-sterile childhood. But more importantly, he's become increasingly detached, always walking around with a blank expression and dark circles under his eyes. When she starts to have nightmares relating to her son, she knows for sure that something is wrong with him.<br /><br />Robert is noticing some strange things, as well. At one point, he runs into Father Brennan (Pete Postlethwaite), a man who seems desperate to warn him about his son. Bluntly put, he believes Damien to be the son of the Devil, and he makes his case by quoting lyrical Bible passages. As you might expect, Robert is initially unwilling to listen to what Brennan has to say, even when he insists that Katherine is in danger. Only when she takes her bad fall does Robert begin to see the pieces falling into place. It's clear, even to Keith Jennings (David Thewlis), a mysterious photographer who sees the clues in his own pictures. Evil may in fact be living among us in the form of a young boy, and if there's to be any hope of saving humanity, his body and soul have to be destroyed.<br /><br />Thus begins a borderline obsessive mission, one that leads Robert and Keith from London to Rome and eventually to Isreal. Robert continually questions his own state of mind along the way, torn between believing his son is the Antichrist and the fact that he may be plotting the murder of an innocent young boy (even though we know the truth). In this sense, the writer is obviously skilled in depicting emotional turmoil. But despite the fact that I found the film's strong emotional core enticing, I think what most attracted me to it was its ad campaign (which, I realize, is not exactly meaningful).<br /><br />I remember seeing the first teaser trailer for it back in the spring, one of the creepiest, tensest teasers I've ever seen. It started with a shot of a dog sitting on a rusty-looking playground carousel. Then the camera slowly pans over to a young boy sitting on a swing set. At the end of the shot, he looks directly into the camera with a simple yet terrifying gaze in his eyes. I also remember seeing plenty of billboards for it. Like the teaser, none of them had the film's title; they only had the date (6-6-06, the cleverness of which faded a long time ago) and a couple of taglines (such as "You have been warned," and "The signs are all around us"). It's probably not a good thing when a film's ads are more impressive than the film itself. I liked this movie at the most superficial level, and because of that I can only recommend it for the way it looks, not for the story it tells.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>It's shocking how a movie that's so stunningly similar to the original can still manage to be lacking. I think most of my gripe is because of the child actor they chose for this one-- he's just plain scary looking, whereas the child in the original was creepily cherubic, his smile sweet and sinister, and his curly locks perpetually hanging in his face. This new kid is cold and dark, offering little besides a few menacing stares and hushed speaking lines.<br /><br />Basic premise: Kate (Julia Stiles) loses her baby during childbirth. Having gone through a difficult childbirth, she's unaware of this, so her husband, politician Robert Thorne (Liev Schrieber) works it out so they can "adopt" a motherless newborn. And of course he tells his wife that this is indeed their child. They name the boy Damien, there's a "happily ever after" montage of birthdays and first steps, and we flashforward to Damien at age 5, who has bags under his eyes, never gets sick, and is a freaky, friendless boy. Kate begins having "delusions" that Damien is evil, and when we see the kid barreling down the hallway on a scooter while mom is standing on a chair at the edge of the balcony watering some flowers, we know that she is most definitely NOT delusional.<br /><br />The rest of the story centers around Robert trying to discover the underlying secrets of Damien's birth. Scenes with David Thewlis (the journalist who snaps eerie photos that contain, gasp, omens) and Mia Farrow (the "I'm here to protect you" nanny) are especially pleasing. Aside from a few cheap tricks to make you jump out of your seat (and you will!), this movie isn't as scary as the original. Worth a look for horror fans and anyone looking for a few good jumps. KINDA SORTA RECOMMENDED.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>The Omen (John Moore, 2006)<br /><br />[NOTE: this review contains a major spoiler. If you have never seen either version of the film, not read David Seltzer's novel, and you plan to, then do not read this review until after you have done so.]<br /><br />What a frustrating movie this is, in that it is possible in many, many scenes to see what could have been. The modernizing touches made in the movie ranged from subtly brilliant to absolutely fascinating (and during the Cardinal's presentation to the Pope early on, you'll be amazed at how the original 1976 poem does match up with current events), and, of course, the better special effects these days made some scenes that were done mostly with camera trickery thirty years ago really shine. And the things they did to make sure it wasn't a shot-by-shot remake, but contained the same basic ideas (for example, transporting the monkey attack to the monkey house at the zoo, rather than the drive-through jungle park), really worked rather well. Unfortunately, some of the rest of the production doesn't live up to those things.<br /><br />In case you've been living under a rock for three decades, a quick overview: a politician's wife gives birth. When said politician, Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber, who seems to be sliding into typecasting as "the remake guy") gets to the hospital, he is told there were complications and the baby was lost, but there's a way to save his wife's somewhat fragile sanity: another baby was born at the same time, and the mother-- the only family the little tyke had-- died during the birth. Thorn could pass the kid off as his own and no one would be the wiser save Thorn and the hospital staff. He takes the deal, and when he wife Katharine (Julia Stiles) wakes up, hey, there's the kid, Damien. Fast forward five years. Thorn is now the ambassador to Great Britain, after his immediate superior was killed in a suspicious explosion, and Damien is five. And things start going a little bit weird-- his nanny kills herself inexplicably. A drunk priest, Father Brennan (Pete Postlethwaite), starts showing up, darkly hinting that Thorn and his wife are in grave danger. A nosy reporter (David Thewlis) starts doing some digging. And we are pointed to the conclusion that Damien Thorn is, in fact, the Antichrist, born to begin the Tribulation foretold in the Revelation of St. John the Divine (as well as a piece of doggerel David Seltzer dashed off for the original script that has become so culturally prevalent many believe it's actually in the Bible somewhere).<br /><br />Schreiber and Stiles were probably the least appropriate choices in all of Hollywood to portray Robert and Katherine Thorn. Stiles (10 Things I Hate About You) and Schreiber (Big Night) have both done credible work in the past, but none of it shows up here. (This is something of a surprise with Scheiber, who has been known to carry entire movies in the past; he was certainly the only thing worth watching about the execrable Phantoms.) It's also a touch scary to think about Schreiber and Stiles married. Though when I look back, there was a much larger age difference between Gregory Peck and Lee Remick, so I should probably get over it. (I had no idea Peck was sixty when he made the original until just now. Now I'm even more creeped out by the original than I was previously.) This is all the more odd because the supporting players are great almost to a man; Thewlis and Postlethwaite are both stellar, as usual. And while there is what we shall refer to here as "great controversy" over Mia Farrow's casting as Mrs. Baylock, Damien's ominous new nanny, I thought she was great here. She had just the right touch of syrupy sweetness to make the deception believable. (As much as I loved Billie Whitelaw's portrayal in the original, nothing about that woman ever said "I should care for your kids." Farrow's character has the appropriate mousiness.) Michael Gambon makes a great Bugenhagen. Etc. You get the idea. Surrounding all these great (and some few mediocre) actors is the general look-and-feel of the film, which many have criticized as ripping off Final Destination (to which others have retaliated saying Final Destination ripped off the original Omen). I think both are partially correct; the idea of the Rube Goldberg-esque supernatural death almost certainly came down to Final Destination through the original Omen, but the feel of the deaths here is very twenty-first century. Consider, if you will, the scene considered the most shocking in the original movie: the decapitation of David Warner. Gregory Peck and David Warner have their argument, and it's dusty and gritty and nasty. And Satan's hand causes a worker not to set his handbrake quite right, so the truck rolls backward, and the sheet of plate glass, and the top of Warner's head bouncing off into the dust. It's ugly. It's nasty. In this version, the street where Schreiber and Thewlis play out the same argument (and, as a side note, a comparison of the two back to back will highlight the deficiencies in Schreiber's acting in this movie quite nicely), it's a much more sanitized scene, lots of brick and cobblestone, no dust at all. Instead of plate glass, the instrument of death is an iron fixture from which a peg is knocked loose by a falling hammer. Glass shatters, iron does not. There's just so much less mess about it. It's a whole different type of atmosphere. It's not necessarily a worse atmosphere; it's just different. I think that's a distinction that a lot of us film snobs refuse to make all too often, especially when it comes to a remake that is, in fact, inferior to the original; it's a cheap shot, something to pile on when heaping invective on a movie that never should've got made in the first place.<br /><br />The thing is, there's so much about The Omen's remake that says it was a film that deserved to be made, like Huston's remake of The Maltese Falcon or Verbinski's remake of Ring, and that it could have been just as good a film, if different than the original. You have to overlook some bad stuff to see it, but it is there to be seen. In truth, the bad stuff is a small part of the total package. Unfortunately, it's the part that's bound to get the most scrutiny, since it comes in the form of the two main characters. ***</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>First off, I think most "Omen" fans knew going in that they weren't going to see anything transcending or equaling the original. That would be a bit unrealistic. Julia Stiles is no Lee Remick, and Schreiber is certainly no Gregory Peck. Mia Farrow's role as Ms. Baylock does not come close that boorish original actress, whatever her name was. And finally, David Thewlis is no David Warner, at least not in this one. We do get some treats, actually more than a few; some of the stylistic additives the director decided to make work spectacularly, and I myself jumped at certain scenes as the other reviewer did. I liked seeing a different take on Damien as a little more threatening than Harvey Bernhard, although in the end I find this ineffectual. The scene in this film where Damien knocks Mrs. Thorn off the balcony with his bicycle is more maliciously done than in the first version. (Here Damien displays telepathic powers occasionally, too--that is how he and Ms. Baylock communicate and one of the ways that his mother ends up quite dead.)<br /><br />Whether you have seen the original film or not, some of this will be genuinely frightening--possibility for nightmare frightening. The ending was done beautifully and some of the classic scenes from the 76' version were creatively enhanced. Not really remade, just enhanced.<br /><br />Why people are complaining so much about a film that adds some innovation to a great movie while not disrespecting it by making some impossible attempt at transcending it is beyond me. (There are only adequate actors/actresses here--the resources simply weren't there. This is a good thing.  There's plenty here to enjoy. (I have to admit, though, that Mia Farrow really disappointed me: you would think a veteran-horror movie actress lik herself would have came to this determined to beat the first Ms. Baylock.)<br /><br />The director has respect for the horror genre, I think, and probably saw all the ridiculous remakes of decent ("When A Stranger Calls", etc) horror films and was unwilling to do that with "The Omen". God Bless him, no pun intended! Worth buying.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>This boxset features every single "Omen" filmed ever produced.

Liev Shrieber, assaying the Peck part, seems as though he's asleep throughout the film, only coming to life at the end as his "Richard Thorn" prepares to kill his son.  Julia Stiles fares better as wife "Kate," trying to cope with the possibility that the child she's raising may have some sinister motives.<br /><br />Mia Farrow's "Mrs. Baylock" strays quite a bit from Billie Whitelaw's in the original, by portraying the nanny as "sweetness" and "grandmotherly," revealing her true nature near the film's conclusion.<br /><br />David Thewlis is no David Warner.<br /><br />Michael Gambon doesn't do justice to Leo McKern's portrayal in the first film.<br /><br />And Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick ("Damian") is about as scary as "The Pillsbury Dough Boy."<br /><br />As far as Goldsmith's Oscar-winning score, it is interpolated during the film's end credits, and snippets can be heard throughout the "softer" scenes of the film.<br /><br />However, maybe the director would've had more success if he had used Goldsmith's score in its entirety.<br /><br />Gus Van Sant in his by-the-numbers "Psycho" remake was smart enough to utilize Bernard Herrmann's classic composition.<br /><br />'Didn't make it a box office smash but made watching it a whole lotta more enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/AAU7CAQIN5BAE.html">AAU7CAQIN5BAE</a><br/><p>The old cliched statement that many reviwers used for films they despised is "2 hours of my life I cannot get back," or something along those lines. Many get tongue tied and really find it hard to say how truly pathetic a film was, so the easy route comes to mind rather quickly. That line, or many like it, is beyond acceptable for this mess.<br /><br />What amazes me the most about film goers, is their unkeen assessment of what a quality remake is. What epic, suspenseful gothic cinema is about. Is this a gothic film? No it's excrement, and the wild and whacky trip in this endeavor was that I knew from jumpstreet how bad it was going to be. I mean honestly, really, truthfully work with me here: can you get any better than Gregory Peck and the classic that this was based on?<br /><br />The answer is a definitive no. The suspense is junvenile at best. This is a film about the anti-christ, make it TERRIFYING. Was it terrifying? No. This is a film about the number 666. That, in itself, should send shivers up our spines. Did it come across in the film in a way to demoralize our senses into the realm of the beast? No. Do not let anyone make you believe this film has any saving graces, as it doesn't. Save the rather stellar actors in the film (Mia Farrow, Pete Postlethwaite) (why someone as superbly talented as Pete Postlethwaite, who I met on the set of Amistad, and is REALLY that amazing, would ever take a role like the one of the priest, is beyond comprehension).<br /><br />Go outside and breath in the life that revolves around us, you'll find more excitement in suburbia, and much more evil lurks out your front door.<br /><br />Pathetic and John Moore is a joke.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>The first film, THE OMEN, is one of my all-time favorite movies, but the sequels go from watchable (DAMIEN: OMEN II) to downright baffling.<br /><br />By the time we get to this film, THE FINAL CONFLICT, it appears that the filmmakers have completely lost touch with their source material and have no idea what they're doing.<br /><br />Did any of them bother looking at the Book of Revelations?<br /><br />I understand budget restraints and such, but how can you literally change biblical prophecy to fit their lame story?<br /><br />The people who saw the original film and were filled with dread understood the coming evil embodied in the demonic child.<br /><br />By the time they get to THE FINAL CONFLICT, they've got to be scratching their heads.<br /><br />The Second Coming of Christ is going to be a tad bit more cataclysmic than featured here.<br /><br />And the fate of the Antichrist is completely baffling.<br /><br />THE FINAL CONFLICT is like making a movie about Adolph Hitler and he's assassinated in 1936.<br /><br />Think about it.</p></br><a href="../users/AFLQGO7CJVK50.html">AFLQGO7CJVK50</a><br/><p>The Omen is a Bible-based horror movie about the rise of Satan in human form in the end of days. 1-3 are pretty accurate according to ancient beliefs but part 4 is pretty much made up with little backup(Antichrist does "increase his number").

Test your faith and courage.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>I had never seen "The Omen 3-The Final Conflict" until recently. After the first two versions in the "Omen" movies were released people pretty much forgot that there was a part three and ultimately a part four. In this film Sam Neill plays the adult Damien (the son of the anti-Christ) who now holds down a serious job as an Ambassador to England for the United States. He decides in order to control the world he must rid those who want to destroy him, namely a series of priests who know about him and his parentage.<br /> The movie is quite engrossing and involving. The story moves at a fast pace and the script is both strong and intelligent. The death scenes are not to be missed as the production is first rate and horrifying.<br /> Sam Neill steals the film as his performance is evil, convincing, and sexy. I never thought that when someone played the son of the devil that they would exude an overabundance of sexuality, but that's what Neill brings to his role. This is also Neill's first major Hollywood film with mainstream audiences knowing him now for turns in TV's "The Tudors" and "Jurassic Park".<br /> The movie is very short on bonuses, but there is an informative audio commentary by director Graham Baker.<br /> "The Omen 3-The Final Conflict" is available as a stand-alone DVD or as part of the impressive "Omen" boxset that features all the "Omen" films.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>Sorry, but I have to talk for a moment about the concept of the "Part 3".  I like watching Part 3s, especially Part 3s to successful, blockbuster flicks.  By the time you get to a Part 3 in a series, the screenwriters are trying their damnedest to put a new spin on the story and take it in a different direction to separate it from the first.  This usually results in laughable, silly and outrageous ideas on film.  After all, everything cool and worthwhile was in Part 1, and sometimes you can wring a few interesting concepts from a Part 2, but by Part 3 you're really stretching it(and of course even more so if more sequels are made).  Stuff like Star Wars and Back to the Future don't count coz they were envisioned as trilogies from the getgo.  But Part 3s can be very fun to watch in their own right.  They might be bad films(in rare cases they are better than the Part 2), but can be enjoyed in a different way than the first film was enjoyed.<br />It's because of Part 3s that Rocky is getting thrown out of the ring by Hulk Hogan, and that Superman is teaming up with Richard Pryor and dealing with an evil twin.  It's also the reason Karate Kid 3 ended up being Karate Kid 3.<br />Well, in this case of Part 3s, I'm talking about the Antichrist.  No, not Will Farrell, good ol' Damien from The Omen.  In the Final Conflict he has managed to go from 5 to 32 years old in the space of 5 years.  He is now reigning king of Thorn Industries and ambassador to Great Britain.  He gets a bit worried when he finds out that Christ has recently been reborn, and sends his "Disciples of the Watch"(Ha! Now I know where Testament got that!) to kill all babies born on that particular day.  If that weren't stressful enough for the Antichrist, there's a gang of Antichrist hunters out to assassinate him.  Armed with those daggers that were given to Gregory Peck in the first film, they periodically attack, only to fail of course.  Besides, wasn't this act supposed to be carried out on hallowed ground?  Oh well, it's a Part 3.<br />There's also a reporter who has the hots for Damien, then eventually realizes who he is, but by that time her son has been brought into the Antichrist fold.  Damien also introduces her to the wonderful world of rough sex.<br />This movie is okay.  It's not terribly exciting, but just interesting enough to make you want to see it through.  Yes, some new concepts are thrown in, but this movie really doesn't feel like a horror film at all, and that's a far cry from the first Omen.  I've always really liked Sam Neill, but it's difficult for me to buy him as the Antichrist.  He's too nice or something.  He seems more just like a corrupt and shrewd  corporate headhoncho than the son of the devil.  Plus, you'd think the "final conflict" between Jesus and the Antichrist would be a bit more epic.  I mean, this is the battle of all battles, baby!!  This should be Cecil B. Demille on friggin' steroids.  This should make Lord of the Rings look like Deathstalker 4.<br />Oh, well.  I guess for a movie that was pretty unnecessary to begin with, it wasn't all that bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>For those who never saw the original, this is a good movie. It's intense, nicely photographed with excellent surround sound, and capably acted.<br /><br />For those of us who watched the original in 1976, the one that starred Gregory Peck and Lee Remick, we have to ask, "What is the point of watching this?" For us - at least most of us - the original is superior, but not by a wide margin, to be fair. I have no problem with remakes if they are not cheaply presented and I was entertained by this presentation even though I knew the story.<br /><br />In both films, the theology is laughable - pure Hollywood, and the priests in here are, too, being clueless about what "grace" and "the cross" are all about. Filmmakers generally won't deal with those topics, but they do a good job in making a case for Satan, I'll give them that. You saw a similar instance of this in "The Exorcist."<br /><br />It was interesting to see this with the updated technology both off (digital surround sound, etc.) and on the screen (laptop computers, cell phones, etc.) but the story is still similar enough that owning both of these films is questionable. Given the choice, I would stick with the 1976 film, but - I repeat: if you've never seen "The Omen," this movie is recommended. It's entertaining, that's for sure.</p></br><a href="../users/A34IBXM7E8CPWE.html">A34IBXM7E8CPWE</a><br/><p>I wasn't expecting much from the "The Omen", after the recent onslaught of Hollywood horror re-treads like "The Fog", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "The Hills Have Eyes", I had my expectations set kind of low. To be honest "The Omen" isn't bad. They have updated the story so that we now get references to 9/11, Hurricane Katrina etc. But overall the story is exactly the same as the 1970's version. And while that can be considered a good thing to some, it ultimately makes the new "Omen" worthless. This movie has already been done, and done well. There are some good parts to the remake, like Mia Farrow's character Mrs. Baylock, the decapitation scene was cool, but overall there really wasn't much worth watching this movie for over the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A35WVFSULRE1G9.html">A35WVFSULRE1G9</a><br/><p>Hollywood is so unoriginal anymore. I was 9 when I seen the original and it scared me to wits, the music, the death scenes, and Damian's sinister look. You can not get any better then Gregory Peck and Lee Remick. I just don't get it. The Fog was redone and so horrible that they didn't even give pre-screening to critics, they knew they had a turkey. The Texas Chainsaw remake, why? The original was way more creepier. Dawn of the Dead remake, zombies running at Carl Lewis speed, I thought they were dead? And now Rob Zombie is remaking the immortal Halloween, I think I will puke at that one. What next remake Jaws, The Godfather, or Caddyshack? Hollywood is so boring anymore. As for this film, yeah it works, if you haven't seen the original, but otherwise the best marketing gimmick was releasing it on 6/6/06. I also heard George Romeros Day of the Dead and the original Friday the 13th are being redone. God help us, remake a film that sucked, like Ishtar or Caddyshack 2.</p></br><a href="../users/ADKA2MJQQCMTO.html">ADKA2MJQQCMTO</a><br/><p>I've said this a hundred times but it never gets any less true, I'll never understand the thought process behind a shot-by-shot remake of any classic film (see also: Psycho).  If Hollywood is so insistant about trotting these reissues out, then for the love of God, remake a BAD movie.<br /><br />The short version of this review is that if you've seen the original (a CLASSIC, by the way) there's no reason on earth to watch this.  If you haven't caught the original yet, then go watch that.  The '06 version, at its core, is a nothing more then a pale carbon copy of it's source material that tries to mask its (many) shortcomings by turning the sound and effects up to eleven.  It has nothing even remotely new, inventive, or interesting to offer.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Remembering the 1976 new film THE OMEN this viewer recalls someone making a dog growling sound in the parking lot at movie's end and how that effect sent gasps and chills through those who had just witnessed Damien and his dogs - a sign of a thoroughly successful thriller.  Now thirty years later (and having the original effect watered down by the subsequent three sequels) out comes a remake of THE OMEN and once again the story and production values of the film jolt even the more staid viewers.  Armageddon now seems frightfully at hand!<br /><br />Though the script is essentially intact form the original version, this OMEN is cast with actors who make the story more credible because they imbue it with more humanly drawn character interpretations.  Much of the power of the film lies in the superb performance by Liev Schreiber as the politically important father of a 'stillborn' son that was 'exchanged' at birth: he gives a warmth and honesty that were elusive in Gregory Peck's performance. Much the same can be said about Pete Postlethwaite's tormented priest who tries to alter the events threatened if the 'adopted' strange son Damien is allowed to mature, and to David Thewlis as the photographer who helps Schreiber's character come to grips with the decision he made about child swapping on the day of the birth of Damien.  Mia Farrow, cosmetically enhanced to look oddly young, is the smarmy nanny and Michael Chabon gives a bit of class to the priest with the dreaded secrets on how to end the impending destruction if Damien is allowed to live.  The weak link in the cast is Julia Stiles who here just can't seem to inhabit the role of the increasingly terrified mother of Damien: likewise the child selected to portray Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) appears more a makeup artist's vision rather than a child whose apparent normalcy could have made the evil within more terrifying.<br /><br />The special effects are used well as is a musical score by Marco Beltrami (though not nearly as memorable as that by Jerry Goldsmith in the original).  An interesting finding is that the original 6-year-old actor portraying Damien (Harvey Stephens) is cast in a tiny part here as a tabloid reporter, giving the feeling that the spirit of Damien is still pervasive.  Director John Moore gets most of right. Not a bad movie as many have stated and one that certainly could have been more powerful with some casing changes, but this film still causes the jitters in an otherwise tranquil evening!  Grady Harp, September 07</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This 1981 film is the second sequel to the oustanding, 1976 gothic thriller "The Omen". The Antichrist, Damien Thorn (Sam Neill), is now all grown up and, having inherited the entire family maga fortune, is now in the process of fulfilling both his destiny and a biblical prophecy of calamitous proportions. Unfortunately for him, however, his very existence is in jeopardy, as the second coming of Christ appears imminent.<p>Damien is kept busy in this film. As Ambassador to England, as well as spiritual leader to a denizen of devil worshippers, he is the target of an assassination plot by a group of priests led by Father DeCarlo (Rossano Brazzi). Damien keeps busy thwarting his would be assassins, usually by consigning them to a brutal demise. He also carries on a romance that ends badly. Damien is very much aware of who he is and where his destiny lies. He is also hell bent on destroying the Christ child, as it is only by doing so that he can survive and fulfill his destiny.<p>This is a relatively well acted film that suffers from a somewhat weak script. Sam Neill is well cast as the grownup Damien, giving a powerful performance. Rossano Brazzi is excellent as Father DeCarlo, the priest determined to end the stranglehold that the Antichrist has on the world. Composer Jerry Goldsmith contributes to the gothic atmosphere of the film with his chillingly creepy, musical score, just as he did in "The Omen" and in the first sequel. Due to its weak script, however, the film pales in comparison to its predecessors. <p>The DVD offers a commentary by the director, Graham Baker but little else by way of special features. It provides clarity of visuals and audio.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>The Omen sequels and its remake are a dispiriting bunch, but this set collects all three original films, the dire TV movie and the weak 2006 remake to make for a cost-effective way for completists to complete their collection.<br /><br />1976's The Omen was easily the best of the wave of Devil movies to come along in the wake of The Exorcist's success, relying less on alternating a naturalistic style with shockingly graphic setpieces but instead putting its faith in a beautifully constructed screenplay that mixed a modern interpretation of the Book of Revelations with a changeling story. Like The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby it puts a Satanic spin on parental fears - in this case the cuckoo in the nest and a mother's fear of her own child. Despite the still impressively spectacular deaths, it's less a horror film and more of a supernatural thriller played straight as Gregory Peck's ambassador is gradually led to believe that his troublesome illegally adopted four-year-old son's real dad might just have horns and a tail and be pretty handy with a pitchfork. Although there are still signs that somewhere along the way the film was aimed for an ambiguity that it never really achieves (is the brat really the AntiChrist or just a very naughty boy? Is Peck seeing the truth or going mad?) Its strength is that it plays its premise absolutely straight. It's helped by some fine casting - Lee Remick, Billie Whitelaw, Leo McKern, Patrick Troughton and especially David Warner as the cynical paparazzi whose photos give the film its title and provide its best chills - and is extremely well directed by Richard Donner, who displays a magnificent use of the Scope frame that leaves the film rather diminished in panned-and-scanned TV outings, while Stuart Baird's excellent editing combines with Jerry Goldsmith's sinister score to make the most of the material. It was a tough act to follow, but even so it's a shame just how far its successors fell short...<br /><br />William Holden, realising too late he missed the boat in turning down the lead in the original, stands in for Peck as the unfortunate ambassador's equally unfortunate brother who's not exactly quick to catch on that there might be something wrong with his nephew as the body count of friends and family rises in Damien - Omen II. Sadly it's a pretty standard by-the-numbers sequel, part rehash but mostly an episodic collection of mostly uninspired killings. Someone suspects Damien, gets killed horribly. Another person suspects Damien, gets killed horribly. Another person... Repeat for 110 minutes, throw in a rushed climax then roll end titles and count the money. As the original's screenwriter noted, it's more a movie about a serial killer despatching anyone who looks at him funny than a modern-day version of the Book of Revelations.<br /><br />Not that it's entirely without ideas - the teenaged Damien isn't too thrilled to learn his destiny at first and, in the film's most effective scene, finds himself failing to win over his cousin (Lucas Donat, generally outshining the Satanic Jonathan Scott-Taylor); and that part of the groundwork being laid for Armageddon involves developing GM crops to control Third World countries is surprisingly prescient, but these ideas are regarded pretty much as filler between the setpieces. Sadly even the best of these - a drowning under the ice and a doctor being sliced in half in a faulty lift - don't bear comparison with David Warner's memorable exit in the original.<br /><br />It's not quite I Was a Teenage Anti-Christ (though even Goldsmith's score has a disco drive to it this time round), but it feels every bit as much an Omen rip-off as any of the drive-in and grindhouse movies that followed in its wake, albeit on a bigger budget. There's a decent roll call of supporting players, from old Hollywood stalwarts Lew Ayres and Sylvia Sidney to future straight-to-video staple Lance Henriksen, and Leo McKern makes a brief unbilled return alongside an equally unbilled Ian Hendry in the Mike Hodges-directed prologue. Most of the military academy scenes were also shot by Hodges before the series really did turn out to be cursed for him at least: he was fired two weeks in to the picture and replaced by Don Taylor. Some of the best footage in the picture was from Hodges shoot, but he took too long getting it for producer Harvey Bernhard's liking (on the audio commentary he gripes at length about how long Hodges took setting up Damien's striking entrance seen through the flames of a garden bonfire). The end result is professionally made but too much of an episodic rehash to hold up as well as the original.<br /><br />At one time intended to be a quartet of films before the falling box-office dictated three films might be a sounder investment, the series reached its devastating anticlimax with The Final Conflict. Returning the story to London and a more classical look (albeit on a visibly lower budget), Damien's graduated to his stepfather's old job as US ambassador but, rather than setting about the serious business of Armageddon, spends most of his time giving interviews, romancing Lisa Harrow's BBC reporter, talking about the nature of evil and worrying about the newly reborn but still in hiding Christ-child sapping his strength while Rossano Brazzi (the film's sole representative of Old Hollywood) and his less-than-magnificent seven monks try to kill him. A modern-day Massacre of the Innocents, a bit of buggery and the odd moment of inspired blasphemy notwithstanding, Damien's counterfeit kingdom is pretty unimpressive and his plan for Armageddon less than half-hearted. As if symptomatic of the film's lethargy, it breaks the franchise's own rules - now it only takes a single dagger in the back to kill him rather than all seven - and even rearranges the chronology (despite being made in 1981, the film alludes to the story happening in 1978). Throw in some limp killings and a terrible ending and it's no surprise this didn't trouble theatres for long.<br /><br />It's not a complete loss, though. Sam Neill makes a charismatic Damien in his first major leading role, making it all the more disappointing that he didn't have a better showcase. Graham Baker's direction is often better than his material, showing a good eye for Scope composition and the harsher parts of the British landscape (though his audio commentary is so sparse he might as well not have bothered). Better still, Jerry Goldsmith outdoes his earlier efforts to conclude the trilogy with one of the finest scores ever written, part grand opera, part Biblical epic, with a grandeur and majesty mostly lacking from the script. And the big dog is back.<br /><br />Skipping the short-lived in-name-only The Omen TV series in the presumed hope that people will forget it ever existed, Omen IV: The Awakening is a strikingly inept TV movie that's particularly bad but sadly not laughably so (though the spinning inverted crosses and some incompetently staged carnage at a psychic fair do provide a couple of smirks). This time round it's a little girl who's adopted by a politician and his wife, but despite one psychic claiming "This is the aura of a Borgia, not a little girl!" she's more bratty than demonic - Damien wouldn't have had to whack a bully with a lunchpail. Cue some half-hearted killings, absurd plot twists and new age crystal guff replacing the Apocalyptic scriptures of the original trilogy, all rendered even worse by an almost uniformly dreadful cast. Michael Learned adds some much needed competence as a private eye, elevating the film at least to the level of mediocrity whenever he's on screen by the simple expedient of being the only cast member who can actually act.<br /><br />Once again the original director (Dominique Othenin-Girard) got fired for being too tardy and - bizarrely - for wanting to make the film more horrific (it was finished by Jorge Montesi, whose priority seems to be keeping it on budget and on schedule no matter how tedious the results). Certainly the film's most effective scene is Othenin-Girard's work, a striking moment where decaying Christmas carollers appear singing the lyrics to Goldsmith's Ave Satani before one character meets their spectacular end. Perhaps the most horrific thing about the resulting TV movie is how atrociously overscored it all is by Jonathan Scheffer, channelling late Bernard Herrmann more than Jerry Goldsmith's original themes and throwing in some bizarre circus music cues as if he was holding a fire sale of old comedy scores. Bad in the worst way.<br /><br />For the first reel or so the 2006 remake of The Omen looks like a fairly promising reworking of the original, throwing in a few new spins and a better exit for the incumbent ambassador to Great Britain than Damien's last big screen outing managed. But while it initially appears better than serial remaker John Moore's dire Flight of the Phoenix, things start to go wrong with the first nanny's exit, which seems purely arbitrary here: where the original briefly established a moment of maternal jealousy that could be interpreted as a threat, here the poor girl doesn't even get a proper establishing shot. Unfortunately it's all too symptomatic of the way he doesn't take the time to establish atmosphere or construct a decent setpiece. Where Richard Donner went all-out to elevate the material in the original with a strong visual sense and a dedication to verisimilitude, Moore directs without flair or panache, something the grotty cinematography merely underlines. By the half hour point it feels like you're watching a film made by slave labor in one of Stalin's work camps, soullessly meeting a quota of footage to meet the 6/6/6 release date and earn their meagre portion of cold cabbage soup.<br /><br />The casting veers between the dismal and the catastrophic. Both Damien and the dog are horribly miscast - neither has an iota of menace, which means the supporting cast need to work overtime to make up for lost ground. They don't.<br /><br />Liv Schreiber seems to visibly lose the will to live as the film progresses, starting off well enough but gradually giving the impression of someone who's been sentenced to six months of community service remaking 70s horror movies, while Julia Stiles, a woman tragically born without a profile, looks like someone waiting forlornly for a phone call from their lawyer telling them they've got her out of her contract and she doesn't have to come in for work tomorrow. The supporting cast fares no better. Mia Farrow proves disastrous gimmick casting, completely lacking in authority or menace in the Billie Whitelaw Scary Poppins role, Pete Posthlethwaite looks more like a man reminding Schreiber to pick up the laundry on the way home than a guilt-wracked lost soul as the priest, Michael Gambon just clumsily extracts the urine playing Bugenhagen as the drunken Father Jack from Father Ted (you almost expect him to cry out "Drink! F--k!! A--e!!! Gurrrls!!!! AntiChroist!!!!!") while David Thewlis' paparazzi comes across as an extremely bored man who hasn't had enough sleep repeating his alibi to the police for the 50th time. When going through the ominous photos, he might just as well be going through the holiday snaps he took that didn't really come out properly for all the enthusiasm he can muster.<br /><br />Nor are the bad decisions limited to the casting. The location work is extraordinarily poor, with Czechoslovakia a particularly poor stand-in for England, not least when CGI relocates the American embassy in London from Grosvenor Square to the South Bank in sight of Big Ben and the strikingly fake London Eye. Even worse is just how absurdly large so many of the locations are. The ambassador's residence is a giant East European castle with a pantry the size of a mini-mart, the embassy a massive conference centre that could fit the real embassy in its lobby twice over. Even the psychiatrist's office looks so like a 60s Bond villain's lair that you expect it to be located in a hollowed out volcano.<br /><br />Heavy going and not much fun with it, it does at least throw in one nice but overly elaborate CGI spin on the original film's decapitation, but it's not really worth sticking with just for that. This is just diabolical in all the wrong ways.<br /><br />The two-disc set of the first film has the best extras package by far - two directors audio commentaries, deleted scene, featurettes Jerry Goldsmith on The Omen Score, Curse or Coincidence?, 666 - The Omen Revealed, The Screenwriter's Notebook, Wes Craven o The omen and the first part of The Omen Legacy that's spread over the first four films, as well as the trailer an easer trailer, but aside from audio commentaries on Damien and The final Conflict, most of the extras on the sequels in the `Pentology' set are actually plugging the remake and, curiously, the trailers for the sequels have been dropped from the previous three-film set. The 2006 remake gets even more self-congratulatory puff pieces, and audio commentary and deleted scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3A4WQL80WOTMH.html">A3A4WQL80WOTMH</a><br/><p>The first Omen was a masterpiece both from the perspective of acting and screenplay and in terms of being a frightening movie.  The second had a weaker screenplay, acceptable acting though still had a few creepy jolts.  This last in the series still has the tone of classic late 70s horror films (actually 1980) and is about on par with the second Omen in terms of production value.  I found it less scary than Omen 2, and nowhere in the neighborhood of the first one.  Parts of Omen 3 seem a little ridiculous, but overall if you like the vibe of 70s "scary dramas", e.g. Omen, Amityville, Exorcist, etc.., then this Omen 3 has a curiosity value that might appeal.  It's not a great film (certainly no 5 stars), nor is it 1 or even 2 stars.  It's somewhere between 3 and 4 stars - I'd understand either.  Since I often give films I didn't enjoy much 3 stars, I'm giving it 4 because I did find it interesting - perhaps not so much for the convincingness of its story, but more for its production and time period.  I found the film fairly well shot.  And again, these devil movies were all the rage a few decades ago while you don't see as many any more.  So perhaps one of my 4 stars is for nostalgia.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>5 stars for Parts 1 and 2 only. the rest nilch.<br /><br />The Original ,simply the best, Along with Part 2, Nevermind anything thereafter. Sequels and reboots,remakes are always a bad thing. This movie will send chills up any sane person. Damien is a brat, How could the characters not see he is an evil spawn? well cause it's a movie and one of the best horror movies. I try not to watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N7YA81ZI4KAF.html">A1N7YA81ZI4KAF</a><br/><p>An American Diplomat living in the UK, Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber) and his wife Katherine, (Julia Stiles) have their lives turned upside down when strange occurrences begin to plague their lives and all seem to be connected to their son, Damien Thorn, who may be the antichrist as foretold in the book of Revelations. The evil forces that are protecting this spawn of Lucifer will do anything to protect his identity and death befalls anyone who dares to investigate this secret.<br /><br />This better than expected remake of the 1976 horror film is technically well done with good performances from the ensemble cast and offers some unnerving imagery and tone. Since this is almost a by the numbers remake of the original, there is very little suspense. Those who have seen the original already know what is going to happen to these characters and to keep them interested, they updated the material (linking the return of the antichrist to today's current events) and inserted a couple of nifty dream sequences which are brief but effective and in one instance, incredibly hair-raising (Robert Thorn's brief dream in Italy- Gotta Love that smiling Priest). I also noticed there is an emphasis on the color red throughout- red flowers, red fruits, characters draped in red cloaks, red night gowns and in one genuinely scary scene, a person draped in red, runs across the screen in the distance just as one of the characters is about to meet their end. Some may find this in your face symbolism a bit too heavy handed but I found it effective.<br /><br />Although the performances were good, I did find the cast a little too young to be truly believable in their roles. There was a maturity and a certain air of sophistication the 2 original leads conveyed that is missing here. However both lead actors still managed to turn in solid performances. I especially liked Julia Stiles. Her take on Kate Thorn differs from Lee Remick's. Stiles gives us a more distant Katherine. One who comes under suspicion of her offspring quite early on and never manages to let go. She seems extremely annoyed by him and once convinced of his malice, she is consumed by fear and paranoia. Despite of what some detractors say, I found her performance the most believable of the bunch and her character, although a lot more rougher around the edges than Lee Remick's portrayal, managed to induce real sympathy. She is after all a victim. Another stand out was Mia Farrow who plays Mrs. Baylock minus the accent. Billie Whitelaw who played the original was sinister enough and resembled a brutally demented Mary Poppins. Farrow's take on this character is still charming but her wickedness is less obvious. Although I do love her sinister smile as she feeds Damien his strawberries just before the vicious little demon gets on his scooter of doom and rides it towards his unsuspecting mother.<br /><br />My only disappointment in the casting was with the choice of Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick as Damien. Admittedly, he is a creepy kid but he fails to convey that innocence that Harvey Stephens, the original Damien had. What I loved about the original, was that Damien, at times, looked angelic and seemed unaware of the chaos that was taking place around him. It was as if he wasn't fully conscious of who he was yet the creepy characters around him made it clear to us that he was the devils offspring. Evil is at its most scary when it comes wrapped in childish innocence. Davey-Fitzpatrick is creepy from the get-go. Another major disappointment was with Marco Beltrami's score. It is good enough but when you are competing with Jerry Goldsmith's original, you better out-do yourself and in this case, the score fails to deliver the chilling magic of the original. The death sequences are pretty standard. They are carbon copies of the original (with the exception of Kate's grisly demise and the photographers decapitation is executed differently) so not much to report here.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is good but when compared to Donner's original, it is inferior. You can say the same about the cast. They do their best but comparing them to Gregory Peck and Lee Remick is not exactly fair (although I did like Stiles) and despite some new elements added- the dream sequences, the hooded demon dog cameos etc and higher, glossier production values, "The Omen" (2006) will forever remain inferior, at least in my eyes, to the greater original visualization of hell on earth.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>Let's face it, the reason the orginal Omen was such a sensation was due to an impaling and a decapitation presented on-screen with fully realized state-of-the-art (for the time) special effects, along with some creepy choral music and the central idea of an evil little kid.  Throw in a hanging, viscious dogs, spooky graveyards and an A-List cast to make it all acceptable and there you have a box office hit.<br /><br />So, what about this remake?  Good cast.  Even better special effects.  Good production.  What's missing?  The shocks.  We all know what's coming and therefore suspense and disbelief at what we're seeing is nowhere in sight.<br /><br />When I saw the original it was truly spooky and suspensful and the murders were actually shocking.  We really hadn't seen it done like that before.  Watching this one, I very much like the actors involved and the production and direction were fine, and they did some slight riffing on the main murders, but I expected them and they came where and when they were supposed to, so no surprise and over-all nothing has really been added or enhanced from the original.  And the Japanese have made evil & creepy kids (especially little girls????) the new mainstay of horror films.<br /><br />The 3 stars are because this was well done and would probably work for an audience that had never seen the original.  But, like Psycho, there was no real reason to re-make this film, and it is impossible to recreate the shock of the first viewing of the originals.  As a faithful remake, at least they did a good job of it, if for no discernible purpose.</p></br><a href="../users/AM2PV53UX1JEQ.html">AM2PV53UX1JEQ</a><br/><p>I was looking forward to the insanely fun idea of re-making The Omen for a modern audience, despite the lingering power of the original, which still makes me shudder.  The clever casting of Mia Farrow notwithstanding, this remake has the same expensive sleek look as the original, and is almost word for word the same screenplay.  What it lacks is the gravity and terror of the original; it's so much the same that it is ultimately pointless.  And even though Gregory Peck and Lee Remick were too old in the original, their stature made the whole movie feel much more important than it had any right to be.  This exercise is more like the recent re-do of PSYCHO - glossy, interesting in paper, but hollow.  And definitely not scary.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>When we last left Damien in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00096S48K">Damien: Omen 2</a> (1978), he had killed his cousin Mark and later his adopted uncle's second wife, Ann who was really his protecter.<br />  In the second film, Damien discovered he was the Antichrist and did have the birthmark of "666" on the crown of his head.<br />  Now Damien Thorn (Sam Neill) is a 32-year old adult and severely dangerous.

But THE OMEN was just a warning of what was yet to come. DAMIEN: OMEN II was released in 1978, where Damien had the reached the age of 12 and fulfilled his Prophecy. But in 1981, OMEN III: THE FINAL CONFLICT was released to a wide audience. This sceond sequel, although not the last, is absolutely amazing and is one step better than DAMIEN: OMEN II.<br /><br />  DAMIEN THORN (played by the brilliant Sam Niell) is now 32 years old and is running THORN INDUSTRIES, has been since the death Richard Thorn, Damien's uncle, who had been running it, since Robert Thorn's death. The death of Britain's current Ambassador has allowed the President of the U.S. to point the position U.S. Ambassador to none other than...Damien. The posistion had once belonged to his father and now, Damien is in the game.<br /><br />  Over the course of the next few weeks, Damien has to thwart out the assassination attempt on his life that is planned by seven monks from Italy, who have possession of the seven daggers. With this in his hands, Damien also has to deal with the second coming of...JESUS CHRIST.<br /><br />  In order to stop the Christ Child, whom Damien calls the Nazerean, Damien orders his disciples to kill every male infant that was born on March 24th of the year taking place. Damien begins an affair with British Television interviewer, KATE REYNOLDS (played by Lisa Harrow), but with the help of a priest named FATHER DeCARLO (played by Rossano Brazzi), Kate finds that Damien is the true Antichrist and he is readying to reign his command on earth after destroying the Christ Child.<br /><br />  With the seventh dagger (since Damien has killed all the monk-assassins and taken the first six daggers), Kate stabs Damien, where he sees the apparition of Christ himself and then dies. Damien, after 27 years of killing and bringing nothing but evil to this earth, is now dead. But do not think that all evil is down and out, for their is another sequel coming your way.<br /><br />  Although, DAMIEN: OMEN II was a great first sequel to its box-office smash of a predecessor, it was not as great as the first film. This second sequel right here, OMEN III: THE FINAL CONFLICT, was just as great as the first film, making up for what the second film did not quite make out to be. Sam Niell is the first major well-known actor to play Damien and he did one hell of a job. Sam Niell, in my opinion, was always a great actor, but he proved that to be 100% true with this role. OMEN III: THE FINAL CONFLICT (although, not final) is waiting you to whip out your credit cards and awaiting to be added to you OMEN collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RTMB76CJWY9U.html">A3RTMB76CJWY9U</a><br/><p>The Omen is about a United States Ambassador who slowly comes to realize that his "son," Damien, is actually the Anti-Christ. It is a remake of a 1976 classic by the same name.<br /><br />It is a very faithful remake.<br /><br />Maybe... too faithful. Allow me to explain.<br /><br />Films are more than plotlines, characters and dialogue. Like literature, they also have mood, tone and style. Again, like literature, there are certain time periods that have certain defining characteristics--Victorian literature feels distinct from literature produced during the Harlem Renaissance. With cinema, 70s movies feel different than 60s movies or 80s movies. They come from different cultures, different times, with different fears, hopes and beliefs.<br /><br />Taking a film from the 70s, like the Omen, and remaking it as faithfully as they have here, feels odd, watching it in a theater in 2006. It doesn't feel like a modern movie. It feels like a 70s movie because, in a lot of ways, it is. This is not to say that it is a bad film--many 70s movies were quite good, and the Omen is a pretty good film in any era. However, it rings slightly off to the modern ear; it arose from a culture and a society that has subsequently moved on. Stephen King, in his excellent Danse Macabre, argued that the evil in horror usually is a manifestation of what the culture currently finds frightening. In the 50s, we were worried about nuclear annihilation, and so most of our horror film threats were either from the skies or the results of science/radiation. A giant bug movie, made today, feels strange (unless it is a throwback parody, like Eight Legged Freaks). This movie, in recapturing a 70s film, is fighting against things that no longer frighten us in quite the same ways.<br /><br />The teenagers in the theater I saw the Omen in didn't need the academic explanation--they knew it was dated, too, and sniggered more often than screamed.<br /><br />Technically, this is a very good film. The acting is all fine, and the filming, direction, lighting, effects, etc., all serve their purposes. The stunt casting of Mia Farrow (who played Rosemary--mother of the Anti-Christ--in Rosemary's Baby, another 70s film) was genius, and she does not disappoint. She plays creepy to the hilt.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good movie and an incredibly faithful remake of a famous 70s film. The biggest drawback, perhaps, is that, by being so very faithful to the original, we've resulted with a movie that is slightly out of step with our current culture and rings slightly false to the modern ear. If you've never seen the original 70s movie, no need--for all intents and purposes, they've recreated it for you, here.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>My personal bias perhaps clouds my judgement when it comes to this film, due in part because of my lack of respect for remakes,sequels,reboots or whatever you want to do. Sure sometimes they come out good,but I prefer the Original which I have seen than this remake(which I also Have seen).</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>This remake has none of the original's underlying creepiness and instead tries too hard to retell a story that has already been done flawlessly.  As they say, if it's not broke don't try to fix it and this film is the perfect demonstration.  The child who plays Damien has maybe 10 lines in the whole movie and instead just sits around looking constipated.  Julia Stiles, who I adore, has all the emotion of a grapefruit as she plays the mother of the antichrist.  Liev Schreiber, much like Derek Zoolander, has one look throughout the entire film--which I like to call "Bored." If the point of a remake is to offer a new perspective on an old tale, this movie serves no purpose.  If you're in the mood to see the Omen go ahead and rent the original because this version falls way off the mark.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"The Omen" is as great as the original! Liev Schreiber & Julia Stiles take over the roles that were originated by Gregory Peck & Lee Remick, very strongly. Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick takes over of Damien excellently, which was originated by Harvey Stephens (who makes a cameo in the film). John Moore's directing is excellent, this is the second remake (Flight Of The Phoenix in 2004) he has done, but the first remake of his that I have seen the original to. David Seltzer's (who, ironically wrote the original Omen) screenplay is as great as it was 30 years ago. This is probably the second American remake to have its screenplay written from the screenplay that wrote the original. The music by Marco Beltrami (who also did Moore's remake of "Flight Of The Phoenix") is great as Jerry Goldsmith's 30 years ago and ironically Goldsmith trained Beltrami. The cinematography by Jonathan Sela is excellent. The film editing by Dan Zimmerman (first assistant editor on "Flight Of The Phoenix") is excellent. The casting by Susie Figgis & Jessica Horuathova is excellent. The production design by Patrick Lumb (supervising art director on Moore's "Behind Enemy Lines" (2001) & production designer on Moore's "Flight Of The Phoenix") is excellent and better looking than the original. The art direction by Katerina Kopicova & Martin Kurel is excellent. The set decoration by Ladislav Markic & Patrick Smith is excellent. The costume design by George L. Little (who has done the costume design to Moore's "Behind Enemy Lines" & "Flight Of The Phoenix") is excellent.</p></br></body></html>

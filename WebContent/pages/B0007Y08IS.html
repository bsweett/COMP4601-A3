This film certainly conveys that sentiment perfectly.  On the one hand, you've got crazed Americans in red-white-and-blue jets destroying various world landmarks while chasing Osama bin laden look-alikes; on the other hand, the sneering directed at Hollywood and liberals in general ("...and they act all corporation-y...") is far more visceral and emphasized.  Recommended to anyone on the right, and if you're on the left, you'd probably better skip this one.<br /><br />James Taranto remarked on opinionjournal a few weeks ago that "Team America" is the only even partially pro-Global War on Terror movie made.  That got me thinking.  *I* certainly can't think of another one, but I can think of several anti-GWOT films ("e.g., "Valley of the Wolf") with a slough more of them right around the corner (e.g., "Redacted").  I feel bad that the only pro-GWOT film is constituted by puppets, but I guess that's about as much as we can expect out of Hollywood.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>How do you review a film with a musical theme that exclaims, "America, F--- Yeah!" It's tough because: a) You need a dirty word thesaurus to avoid filing a review with more expletives than an Andrew Dice Clay rant, and b) It's hard to work when you're constantly giggling to yourself incessantly.<br /><br />"Team America: World Police" is the anti-blockbuster. The characters are marionette puppets whose strings are in plain sight because it's funny. The voice-overs don't sound anything close to the celebrities and politicians they're representing, because it's funny. But much of the dialogue--with the exception of the cursing--could be pulled straight from any Jerry Bruckheimer film...because it's funny.<br /><br />"South Park" creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker offend everyone in "Team America"--foreign and domestic leaders, conservatives and liberals, outspoken Hollywood mouthpieces and...outspoken Hollywood mouthpieces. But one thing they are clearly critical of is the United States foreign policy mentality of kick ass now, ask questions later. If there's a hell, Parker and Stone will be living in the penthouse.<br /><br />But let's talk about the puppets. The marionettes look slick. When they speak, the movements of their mouths fluidly match their words. In other words, they put Milli Vanilli to shame. And the stuff that they can't do without herky jerky silliness, namely Kung Fu fighting and love making, comes off as so hilarious that it's almost too bad all movie actors couldn't be replaced by puppets.<br /><br />Team America is a no-holds-barred freedom fighting force that's called in whenever there's an international emergency. They live in Mt. Rushmore, drive souped up super vehicles and wield rocket launchers. The team is led by Spottswoode, a debonair smooth talker with an ambiguous sexual preference. When one of the team members is killed by terrorists (who speak a broken record of "Jihad bakakakaka"), Spottswoode recruits Broadway thespian Gary Johnston to "act" his way past the terrorists and infiltrate their treacherous network. Unbeknownst to Team America in the beginning, North Korean leader Kim Jung II, is secretly supplying terrorists with WMDs. Kimmy is probably the most hysterically rendered---and most un-PC character. I can't give out more information without committing a hate crime.<br /><br />While Team America takes out their targets, they also take out many people and international treasures that aren't their target, a.k.a collateral damage. They take out the Eiffel Tower, the Sphinx and thousands of innocent puppets. And when they do, they draw the ire of the Film Actors Guild (an acronym I don't need to dwell on...but one that "Team America" does). An obviously spoof on the Screen Actors Guild, it comprises Alec Baldwin, Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon and other celebrities who use their notoriety as a political soapbox. Of course, now, actors are using their notoriety as a soapbox to speak out against "Team America" in some sort of ironic countermeasures. Confused? Me too.<br /><br />If you don't know anything about "Team America: World Police," when you step into the theater, you'll be like a rich kid on Christmas morning. You'll get every damned thing you want, from hot puppet sex to gory puppet deaths, playful songs with illicit lyrics and more. No strings attached.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>You may disagree with me, but 'Team America -- World Police' is NOT the best thing Trey Parker/Matt Stone have ever created.  It is still Eric Cartman, or any characters in 'South Park' which should be called their best, but, well, like most reviewers before, I find 'Team America - World Police' mostly funny.<br /><br />I said, 'mostly,' for some parts are definitely unfunny, but I'll talk about it later.  Inspired by a UK cult TV show 'Thunderbird' made in the 60s, the self-appointed marionett rescue team save the world from the terroists.  Of course, that's a satire, and the target is the current US policy, but Trey Parker doesn't stop there.<br /><br />[MAKING FOOL OF ... EVERYTHING]  Yes, don't think about the politics.  Michael Moore (I mean his lookalike puppet) appears, but the purpose of his inclusion here is, it seems, not political but very personal, as if Trey Parker (who was briefly in 'Bowling for Columbine') has some grudges against him.<br /><br />Anyway, 'Team America' makes fool of the right, the left, or everything it thinks deserves bashing.  The film's story itself is mocking Jerry Bruckheimer films, in which an all-American boy is made an all-American hero after many struggles (read actions) and some pains (read booze) before he gains the big prize (read love, or a chick).  Which means the film includes a 'love scene' of the marionetts, of which reality would be embarrassing to some.  And you can hear a song stating the quality of one Micheal Bay film and the acting abilities of Ben and Cuba.<br /><br />[HOLLYWOOD STARS] And what is most daring (and outrageous) is the special appearances of the Hollywood celebrities, who are, according to the film, too politically aggressive.  It's easy to imagine that Trey Parker doesn't like those actors who express their views on politics in the programs like 'Crossfire' or the magazines like 'Rollingstone.'  Unfortunately, however, this is the least satisfying part for me, because, quite frankly, these marionetts just don't look like the real counterparts.  Alec Baldwin looks more like his brother Daniel, and other lookalike puppets are no better.  (Interestingly, George Clooney's puppet appears, but he receives comparatively better treatment among the final action scene, in which those "celebrities" turn baddies and meet nasty fate.  And Clooney is a known 'South Park' fan, and appeared there.  Maybe Trey Parker didn't bring himself to treat him bad, even a puppet.)<br /><br />Technically, however, the marionettes of the main characters  are fantastic (especially those of 'Lisa' and 'Gary'), with their subtle facial expressions which look often so uncannily real.  And also very impressive is the national leader of North Korea, where this film would be banned forever with good reasons.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching 'Team America' though it often goes too far, and still I like 'South Park' better, both TV series or the filmed version.  And surely 'Team America' has political aspects, but you don't have to offended with them.  It's just a comedy -- a comedy to which nothing is sacred.  Enjoy it as such if you can.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ.html">A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ</a><br/><p>I saw this film in theaters out of curiosity factor. I didn't know if I could sit through a 90+ minute film of puppets, but this surprised me with its humor and catchy songs. Trey Parker and Matt Stone really outdid themselves with this one. They achieved a near brilliant film...with only a few minor objectionable and possibly offensive scenes.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest controversial scene that required to be cut was the sex scene. Even though it is laughably funny the MPAA demanded cuts to this scene or risk an NC-17 rating, I do understand their decision. If parents brought their children thinking this was a "kid's movie"...the sex scene would have raised some uncomfortable questions from their children. Its a raunchy and funny scene that adults will get a kick out of. There is another scene that I wasn't sure if it was a parody of how Americans reacted to the Monica Lewinsky scandal (especially since we now know that Clinton was trying to go after Osama but Republicans in Congress claimed he was merely using Osama to distract Americans from "the real problem"--i.e. sex). The scene is funny, but it wasn't clear what the point was...other than to be as offensive as they could be.<br /><br />For me, the reason I detract a star is because I thought the vomiting scene went on too long and it was disgustingly tacky. I thought that scene would never end, as just when you think the puppet couldn't vomit any more, out comes another spew. Judging the laugher I heard in the theater, I guess for some people, the puppet could vomit for 30 minutes and still be funny, but I stopped laughing after the second time.<br /><br />I love the skewering this film does at the likes of Jerry Bruckheimer films (with a song about why the film "Pearl Harbor" sucked--which was so true), our nationalistic and macho aggression (with the song "America, F*** Yeah!"), the musical "Rent", evil dictators (I'm sure this film is banned in North Korea, with the Elmer Fuddish Kim Jong Il lisping "I'm so Ronery"), and most of all, pretentious Hollywood actors and their causes (watch out Sean Penn, Janeane Garofalo, Alex Baldwin). Everyone gets a deserved kick in the pants...conservatives and liberals. Who would be offended more by this film? I would put money on conservatives, since this film flaunts raunchiness in their faces (with the sex scenes and profanities). This film is a great satire about America as it was in 2004. I left the theaters still laughing with one song stuck in my head (the hard charging and macho "America, F*** Yeah!"). If you enjoy satire and don't get easily offended, buy this dvd and get the soundtrack as well. You'll be surprised how a movie about puppets can entertain and still make a point. The biggest point being...aren't we all puppets playing by someone else's hands (manipulation)? We need to cut the strings of our attachments and avoid both extremes...for they both have agendas more sinister than we realize. I'm glad someone had the courage to make this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>I wish this movie had sequels.  It even made it into a US Military scandal in Iraq or Afghanistan (I can't tell the difference) when the American soldiers were videotaped "durka durka durka" -ing at a civilian family before they killed the family.  They got into trouble for that.  Check youtube for their home video that was the smoking gun.  I bet Team America's Buck O'Five philosophy influenced numerous young Americans to enlist and carry weapons in some far off dessert inhabited by foreigners.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NOZB6VZCTOI4.html">A2NOZB6VZCTOI4</a><br/><p>"Team America World Police" is a political satire from Trey Parker and Matt Stone about their perceptions of America's role as the world's policeman. Made with "Thunderbirds" style marionettes, the plot springs from the destruction of much of Paris while pursuing terrorists, where an elite U.S. counter-terrorism group loses a member; the replacement turns out to be an actor with a boatload of emotional baggage. Before long North Korean crackpot Kim Jong-il plots world destruction with the help of the Film Actors Guild, lead by Alec Baldwin. An assortment of leftist actors sympathizes with Kim and believes everything to be America's fault. Satire can be the best indicator of reality; certainly this is one of those times as the film satirizes the arrogance, na?ve, and simplistic attitudes so prevalent in the chic Hollywood political activist circuit.<br /><br />The film is somewhat libertarian in attitude, as it mocks elements from all political factions from Derkaderkastan to Hollywood. By far most of the venom here is directed at the far left Hollywood elite, with special treatment reserved not only for Baldwin, but Michael Moore (who is referred to as a "giant socialist weasel," and who blows up Mount Rushmore), Martin Sheen and Tim Robbins (who are North Korean guards), Sean Penn, Susan Sarandon, Janeane Garofalo, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Danny Glover, Peter Jennings, and others. The actors meet fates appropriate for the film, with Glover and Penn being eaten by house cats, for instance.<br /><br />The United Nations, as impotent in this film as it is in real life, is also rightfully mocked. The U.N. sends the useless Hans Blix to inspect Kim Jong-il's property, and Hans is quickly eaten by Kim's sharks. Kim gets to sing a ballad about loneliness that is the musical highlight of the film, although I loved the battle preparation song complete with the line "we're gonna' need a montage" almost as much.<br /><br />As you might expect from Parker and Stone, the film is frequently tasteless (e.g. extensive marionette vomiting) and is very politically incorrect. I am by no means a fan of "gross out" humor, and while some of the gags could have been dispensed with, the satirical points made by Parker and Stone are completely legitimate. Unsurprisingly some of the people caricatured in the film were unhappy with the skewering they received. Penn wrote a hostile and profane letter to Parker and Stone as a result, which seemed to prove that he can dish it out but can't take it, although Clooney was more mature and claimed that he would have been insulted had he not been parodied in the movie.<br /><br />The film is refreshingly independent and did well at the box office (grossing approximately $51 million), which provides hope that more films not beholden to the uber-left Hollywood mentality will be greenlighted in the future. While "Team America" is nowhere near perfect, it does have many funny moments interspersed with the gratuitous grossness, and most importantly of all, effectively skewers its targets, which was the point in making a satire in the first place.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Team America:<br /><br />Probably one of the most funniest movies I have ever seen despite featuring puppets!!! The movie is Hilarious,<br />And so true, Hans Flix(U.N. Inspector) "We will be very very Angry"in reply to what will happen if Kim Jong-Il does not comply with the Joke that is the United Nations, "Derka!,Derka"Soundtrack is hilarious. This unrated Dvd is Awesome.The Best is the portrayal of the Film actors guild and the silly liberal stance they take. Matt Damon!<br />All at these Celebs expense you can laugh at, Sean Penn,Clooney,Douglas,Susan Sarandon,Tim Robbins, "We Guards,Guards". so many lines stick out, I can understand were liberals can't stomach this movie.

I love all the jokes about the F.A.G. actors, the terrorists, the song about AIDS, the puppet sex, and much more! It's a fun movie to watch. The leader of Team America named Spottswoode hires a brilliant stage actor named Gary Johnston to help them retrieve information about WMDs. Gary and Lisa fall in love, but Sarah is mad about that. Soon, the whole team is taken by Kim Jong-il's men. Gary tries to help stop him from carrying out his evil plan.

Brought to us by the Matt Stone & Trey Parker who brought us South Park this is just another example of why these guys are so admired in the world of comedy. Team America a thunderbirds like crew of police who are determined to destroy terrorism from the Muslims.<br /><br />To most people this would be considered to be a racist attack on Muslims but that's not the case, it is merely a poke of fun at the way people look at Muslims since the start of the war and that is shown by how they speak in the movie because after all they are from "turka turkastan."<br /><br />The Team itself are puppets worthy of Thunderbirds and it is very comical how they walk and did i mention the puppet sex scene? yes you heard me right a puppet sex scene which will have you roaring with laughter(That was when the wee came out).<br /><br />Like in South Park even the celebrities aren't safe in this political movie as they are part of a crew determined to gain control of the world.<br /><br />If you are a fan of silly type comedy then you will certainly love this film because it is hysterical.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>The creators of South Park  do it again and make one of the crudest and funniest movies you'll see. Not sure how Roger Ebert or anyone could just dismiss it with one star. It makes fun of politics and celebrities and pretty much everything else. They even turn Matt Damon into a moron that can just say....Matt Damon. I'm a Matt Damon fan but when he did that it always got me to laugh out loud. Plus they turn Alec Baldwin into the world's greatest actor that no one can out act.<br /><br />  I never thought a movie with puppets could be so damn funny. Even the song (Pearl Harbor Sucked but I love you) was pretty funny. Well the song went something like that. The song knocks Ben Afflick's acting skills. Even the Team America theme song is uncalled for. "America "F" YEAH!" It also offers a crude and disgusting but also hilarious sex scene. Plus there's one of the grossest longest puke scenes in the history of film. It goes on so long that it even made me start to feel sick. Still I was laughing while feeling sick.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>The creators of South Park Trey Parker and Matt Stone made a film that is an odd theme to it: serious action and romance but it involves puppets with very visible strings. So of course it ends up becoming funny on that basis and on another basis due to the film itself. Some parts maybe aren't as funny but more often than that it hits its mark.<br /><br />There's Middle Eastern terrorists in Paris and Team America, a force assigned to protect America although maybe not officially comes to the rescue. Only they end up causing more damage than the terrorists do and they lose one of their members. It's believed that Kim Jong Il, North Korea's dictator is going to strike but they don't know where.<br /><br />So they hire Gary, a Broadway actor who's starring in Lease, a spoof of Rent(with its big closer "Everyone Has AIDS"). They hire him to infiltrate terrorist headquarters and find out their plans.<br /><br />As for the film's famous puppet sex scene, it's funny looking at it cause it looks funny but there's 2 sex shots that kind of ruins it and turns it from being funny to just weird and gross. It's funny that people got so riled up about it since the puppets don't even have "parts" besides the woman who's got breasts. It's more of the implied nature of the position/sex act which riles up people. Maybe you've done something they've done, who knows.<br /><br />The violence is slightly over the top, only cause you're looking at puppets. One puppet gets the top half of his head kicked off while panthers(they're actually real live cats) starts snacking on a puppet's neck and taking the head with it.<br /><br />One great aspect of the film is the songs. It's got characters singing them or just part of the soundtrack but you got the aforementioned "Everyone Has AIDS", the Team America theme "America(F*** Yeah!)" and Kim Jong Il's ballad "So Ronely". He doesn't really pronounce words clearly so that's actually lonely or when he says Arec Ballwin instead of Alec Baldwin.<br /><br />Like the title says, there's humor here that is so blatantly offensive you'd be shocked yet you'd laugh with everyone else and be like "hey wait a minute that's offensive! &lt;another funny scene, you laugh> why did I laugh at that again? Isn't it gross?"</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>If you haven't been keeping up on current world issues or have lived under a rock for the last 10 years, this movie is not for you. If you thought of bringing your kids along, because it has puppets, don't. If you have an open mind, and are not offended by crude humor, puppet sexuality and violence, and severe stereotypes, this movie is brilliant.<br /><br />If you are a fan of South Park you will feel right at home. This movie delivers the same one liners you come to expect in an episode of South Park. The movie pulls no punches and takes jabs at celebrities big and small.<br /><br />The music deserves its own review. The music in this movie made me laugh harder than I ever have before in my life. Seriously. The Team America theme song is pure genius.<br /><br />If you are sensitive about the current situation with terrorism and the way we tend to handle it with our current situation, this movie may not be up your alley. If you can see the humor in all of it and feel like a good laugh, run, swim, fly, do whatever possible to go see this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>Team America: World Police is a rather funny and well-made film that is not afraid to bash liberal politics, celebrities, and third-world countries like North Korea. I really enjoyed the fact this film is not afraid of flipping the bird to people like Michael Moore and other celebrities like Alec Baldwin and rubs their faces in the fact that they are total jackasses and need to shut the hell up.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: When a member of Team America is killed by terrorists, they find another man; a Broadway actor named Gary; and use him to dress up and act like a terrorist in order to foil plans of a massive worldwide terrorist attack, but what they don't know is that North Korea has been supplying the weapons to terrorists and is the main country planning a worldwide terrorist attack. So they must foil these plans as well, and prevent Hollywood's most well-known hardcore liberals from getting in the way. Yes, this film does use marionettes for the characters.<br />MUSIC: There is decent music, and not to mention the fact the filmmakers actually wrote some of the songs played in the movie and they aren't afraid to use the F-word in them either.<br />GORE FACTOR: Yes, there is gore in this movie. Limb-ripping, getting shot to death, exploding, splatting on the ground, being eaten by giant cats, and more.<br />ENTERTAINMENT: This film is quite funny, rather dirty and inappropriate in so many ways, and very gory. What damages the quality of this film is a slow and stupid beginning and the puppet love-making scene made me want to gouge my eyes out because of how disturbing it was (They basically did almost every sexual act known to man). This is definitely not for kids, oh no it's not at all for kids.<br />OVERALL: This film is definitely worth a buy for a good laugh and it will keep the laughs coming. This film is not afraid to be offensive or disturbing so if you easily get offended or grossed out you've been warned.<br />THE GOOD: Unafraid of bashing liberal politics, it's funny, it's gory, and it's very entertaining.<br />THE BAD: Slow beginning, disturbing puppet love-making scene.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z379ES750ZRY.html">A2Z379ES750ZRY</a><br/><p>One of the greatest films ever made.

Try imagining sixteen year old boys sneaking into the movie studio when their parents aren't around.  Team America is juvenile humor on steroids.  Our heroes are out to save the world from militant Muslims and the Communist terror of Kim Jong Il---and the naive actors like Sean Penn, Alec Baldwin, and Helen Hunt who stand in their way.  The terror masters manipulate the Hollywood crowd to unwittingly further their evil plans.  And no, this film is not even slightly politically correct.  Everyone may be offended.  Both the religious right and the goofy left will find things to appall them.  The vulgar language and wild sex scenes (yes Virginia, puppets do indeed enjoy sex!) will definitely get your attention.<br /><br />Team America's irreverent and insightful look at today's terrorist threat makes it well worth your time.  Ultimately, it not too subtly argues that the terrorists must be opposed by violence.  Pacifism will only render us vulnerable.  Our enemies primarily respond only to a serious booty kicking.  It's a message that needs to be heeded.  Are you too late to see Team America at your local theater?  In that case, you should purchase the dvd version.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Team America: World Police is a madcap concept: lampoon America's current war-frenzied culture with marionettes.  Who would possibly want to watch such a film?<br /><br />On the film's surface, the very appearance of the marionettes, being pulled by someone else's invisible strings, seems to have some symbolic value.  Or maybe they just thought it would be funny to have puppets do things that no puppets should ever do.<br /><br />The movie also a throwback to Thunderbirds, a futuristic series produced in 1965 that heavily utilized "supermarionation," which used marionettes suspended and controlled by thin wires. In that series, the marionettes were played with deadly seriousness, despite the fact that they were, you know, puppets. You have to ask why creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone would want to use a technique few people remember from the sixties...unless they were making a statement about an era that also happened to involve an unpopular war. Ahem.<br /><br />It's very easy to dismiss Team America as farcical garbage, a lewd, violent attack on every sacred crow conceivable.  And on the surface, Team America can be appreciated for that alone: a conservative organization that espouses American values with unabashed patriotism sends Team America to blow up bad guys while destroying the homes and artifacts of the people they're trying to save; a liberal nutjob (Michael Moore) turns into a suicide bomber; Kim Jong Il really IS part of an axis of evil manipulating terrorists to blow up the world; actors with no experience in warfare speak out about the war, forming the Film Actors Guild (FAG); and a struggling actor named Gary is recruited from a Broadway musical that sounds suspiciously like Rent. Nobody is safe in Team America.<br /><br />But anyone who watches South Park knows that Parker and Stone are far shrewder than their "supercrappymation" might lead one to believe.  They are the deconstructionists of our age, fearlessly criticizing hypocrites everywhere, whatever their political, global, or religious affiliation might be.  Only these two would compare a Middle-Eastern bar to the cantina from Star Wars...because frankly that's about the most exposure Americans have ever had to Middle-Eastern cultures.  Heck, even the title "World Police" is laden with assumptions about America's global responsibility or lack thereof. Even Matt Damon, whom Parker and Stone think is actually a pretty cool guy, gets turned into a monosyllabic thug.  Trust me, he got off easy.<br /><br />They never let you forget that this is all done with puppets too: real black cats are substituted for panthers, puppets slap each other helplessly in some pathetic approximation of a fist-fight, and two opponents slow down and spin in the air as they face off, Matrix-style...all with the help of their marionette strings. And I don't need to mention what the puppets do to/with each other in the bedroom...<br /> There are also parts that are a little dated.  Yes, making fun of Ben Affleck in Pearl Harbor is always fun, but it dates the film.  Rent's also an easy target...but does anyone really care that much about Rent to make fun of it?<br /><br />Team America mows down anything and everything with a no holds barred approach. If you take yourself a little too seriously, chances are you'll find this movie offensive or irrelevant.  But if you aren't afraid to laugh at the inanities of the modern world, as viewed through the seriously warped lens of big-budget action movies, then you'll probably enjoy Team America: World Police as a hilarious romp through a decade our descendants will most assuredly find amusing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LXKO2S6G2DBI.html">A3LXKO2S6G2DBI</a><br/><p>While I enjoy raunchy, unpretentious comedies as much as the next guy, I generally like them to be funny.  And smart.  "Team America:  World Police" isn't much of either.  Oh, there are a few bits I guffawed it, not limited to the infamous, graphic puppet sex scene, which lampoons, among other things, the MPAA's rather narrow-minded view that showing sex without genitals will somehow be less problematic than showing sex with.  Kim Jong Il is a hoot, about the only aspect consistently amusing, though he's so much like Saddam Hussein in the much, much better "South Park:  The Movie," right down to his demise, that it felt like I was viewing outtakes from the previous effort.  And while the puppets are an interesting -- and cheap -- novelty, they're never really used in quite the same stylish fashion as the Gerry Anderson shows from the 60s they invoke.  Ostensibly the plot of "Team America: World Police" concerns an elite if clueless group of WASPy heroes who save the world from terrorists . . . while generally destroying much of what they've come to save.  The swipes at U.S. foreign policies that impose values rather than inspire them are here, but both liberals (in the form of Hollywood headline-mongers and armchair diplomats) and conservatives (as freedom-through-firepower types, echoed in the movie's absurdly jingoistic country music songs) take it on the chin.  Yet for all the hoopla, this Parker/Stone vehicle never is all that clever.  The humor is about what you'd expect from sixth-graders playing naughty with dolls, and the satire is too obvious to be biting.  I'm sure the film is a hit around frat houses, but that's probably about it.

I had also heard about a puppet sex scene (which almost garnered the film a NC-17 rating) and that the film was full of foul language. I must say I was kind of surprised about how funny the movie actually is.<br /><br />TEAM AMERICA is about a group of five warriors from different parts of the country joined together to fight the War on Terror. The movie opens in Paris, France as we see much of the carefree happiness that the city has to offer.  A young French boy skipping along while eating a chocolate popsicle bumps into a Middle Eastern-looking man carrying a briefcase with flashing lights. The man stares him down and the child runs to his mother and tells her what he sees. They turn to leave and moments later Team America bursts onto the scene.  Team America succeeds in killing the terrorists and capturing the WMDs, but they also knock down the Eiffel Tower and have one of their own killed.<br /><br />Team America learns from I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E. (the group's super-duper computer) that terrorists are plotting a major world-wide attack 1,000 times the size of 9/11.  Their mentor, Spottswoode, knows they don't have a chance unless they can get an actor to join their team (that's right, an actor). So, he sets forth and finds the best actor in the world, Gary Johnston.  He brings Gary to the Team's hideout in Mt. Rushmore and tells him what's at stake. Gary joins the team, but upon learning after a successful mission that his involvement with the team possibly caused other people to be killed, Gary quits the Team and hits rock bottom (literally, after passing out in his own vomit).  With Gary's departure, the Team is left without an actor and they don't have a chance.  Michael Moore and all the members of F.A.G. (Film Actors' Guild) unknowingly assist the leader of the massive terrorist takeover, Kim Jong Il, as he prepares for world domination.  Only Gary Johnston can save the day, but only if he proves to Spottswoode that he is dedicated to the team.<br /><br />I was suprised at how humorous TEAM AMERICA is.  I was a little offended by all the foul language and felt it was overdone, but like the unnecessary sex scene that might have been the whole point. TEAM AMERICA has two major targets in the movie:  the war on terror and the Hollywood establishment.  The humorous jabs at the War on Terror are evident from the movie's opening scene in Paris and don't let up until the very end of the film.  As the only superpower in the world and the leader of democracy, we have a duty to "police" the world persay. However, no matter who we help (because we can't help everybody) somebody else is going to hate us because we didn't help them or because we helped their enemy.  Sometimes we overstep our duty and are careless. This is parodied in the movie and in a hilarious way.<br /><br />The second biggest target in the movie is the Hollywood establishment.  Hollywood is a powerful place and having been the center of the dream factory for almost a century, it's no wonder that many of the people who become stars think they are the kings and queens of the world.  As Bruce Campbell wrote about in CHINS THAT KILL, Hollywood is a land filled with spores. The spores cause people to not think logically and normally.  Even the most innocent and well-guarded can fall victim to the spores.  The spores destroy all that is good, right, and true. Anyway, it's amazing that people who dropped out of high school and just because they make a few movies, think they have the right to "rule" the world.  This mentality is parodied to perfection in TEAM AMERICA.  Alec Baldwin (who recently chastised his younger brother Stephen for becoming a Christian and Republican) is perhaps made fun of the most as the leader of F.A.G., but Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, Michael Moore, Liv Tyler, Matt Damon, and a handful of others are also parodied.  All of the actors who actually make it into the film are people that have made political statements over the past several years, but really aren't that knowledgeable about anything.  Like the unnecessary foul language and sex scene, much of what Hollywood does is useless and pointless.<br /><br />Anyway, this isn't a movie for kids. It isn't a political movie either, making fun of two extremes on both sides. However, it is interesting that there are more conservatives who seem to enjoy the film than liberals. If you're looking for something that's crude, but hilarious and is a little different, TEAM AMERICA is for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A25QJBK33C4O0R.html">A25QJBK33C4O0R</a><br/><p>"He's getting away with the WMDs!"<br /><br />Oh this movie is far from politically correct (as with just about all of the Parker and Stone creations) but it is outrageously funny and entertaining.<br /><br />While I had been avoiding buying things in the UMD format initially, the release of the Slimline PSP with it's ability to output to TV via the add-on cable had me going back and buying some favorites for viewing on the PSP with the thought being that I could at least watch the same movies on the bigger screen if I desired.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that I'll get in just about every available format as I can't help but watch it when I catch it on the TV and then get irritated by how censored the movie is and how badly it's chopped up for insertion of commercials and such.  At that point I pull out the appropriate format disc and watch my own uncensored copy.<br /><br />This one is for you Kim Jong... ;-)</p></br><a href="../users/ALG7QH2L5JL2L.html">ALG7QH2L5JL2L</a><br/><p>[...]<br /><br />After I had dried my eyes from the tears of laughter; after the 'theme song' with its catchy headline ("America, f... yeah, got to save the m.....f...... world") had finally stopped bouncing around in my head; after I managed to stop chuckling quietly, or not-so-quietly, occasioning my wife and daughters to look at me oddly and shaking their heads; after sleeping over it for a night...I finally asked myself whether it was really necessary to be quite as vulgar to get a point across: whatever that point may have been.<br /><br />The answer, I decided, was 'yes', for, in its contrast with the piss-takes on the universe of Hollyweird movies and the merciless and welcome satire on the theme of actors-and-other-insignificants-turned activists, it makes a serious statement, more profound than any learned discussion is ever likely to produce (or me, writing this!). Tray Parker made it explicit it in an interview with 60 Minutes: "Society is our only hope".<br /><br />Indeed. And society consists of human beings, most of whom have a definite element of vulgarity. I wonder if it isn't true to say that _everybody_ has a core of vulgarity, even if it's covered up by the layers upon layers of thin and fragile veneer. American society evidences this vulgarity more openly than many others, though that isn't an indication that it actually _is_ more vulgar than, say, some of those European nations, who consider themselves more 'refined' and 'cultured'.<br /><br />The final speech by the actor 'Gary', in front of an assembly of 'world leaders' captivated by the vapid utterances and platitudes of 'Alec Baldwin' (Parker-and-Stone's satire is without mercy or fear) is a vulgar, graphic and utterly to-the-point summary of the essence of Amercian society, what it stands for and against; on those who stand against it; and on the fundamental substance of the 'War on Terror'.<br /><br />TA:WP not a movie for the faint-hearted, and it has a truly disturbing sequence (and I don't mean the one with the puppets having sex, and at some length) that had the audience dead-silent. But Gary's final verbal show-off against 'Alec', with its extensive and extended use of genital and anal metaphors, was a profoundly patriotic (and screamingly-funny) tirade that surely must go down as one of the most outrageous monologues in film history.<br /><br />[...]</p></br><a href="../users/A331OF34UX4Y1K.html">A331OF34UX4Y1K</a><br/><p>I did not see it coming. This movie is SO good. And it was not an esay undertaking. Theproducers really made theirbest with the puppets.<br /><br />This movie is plain fun. A lot of jokes are good. Of course, coming from Trey Parker and Matt Stone, there are the usual flatulence jokes, vomit jokes, sex jokes. But they are much more restrained and well placed than the South Park feature lenght movie.<br /><br />The soundtrack is clever, simple and right to the point. In truthe (as you can see in teh special features) this is a joke about Jerry Bruckenheimer movies. I enjoyed the whole movie, no weak spots here.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE:  Trey Parker and Matt Stone create a genre within themselves and this is their latest addition.  What this movie basically is, is a spoof of big budget action movies and politics.  The whole movie is laugh out loud.  Whether it was the rebellious actors of the Film Actors Guild (...) teaming with Kim Jong Il or the many spoofs put on action movies. There is an entire montage scene and with it is a song that describes what a montage really is. An entire song is dedicated to Michael Bay and how he screwed up with Pearl Harbor. Then there is puppet sex, oh so hilarious puppet sex. The movie feels a lot like South Park, but it's different enough to hold on its own. Every joke in this movie is laugh out loud funny. I only recount having one or two moments to catch my breath. Every time Team America comes flying out in full force, the Team America theme song plays along, "Team America, F&%K YEAH!" Then there's the aspect that they actually got Harry Gregson-Williams to do the score of the movie so it actually sounded like an over-produced action movie. The political references come flying in one after another, and so do the movie references.  Every action movie cliche is addressed here and will have you laughing.  What really makes it funny is the stiff limited movement these puppets have. When the main character fights Samuel L. Jackson it's the funniest thing I have ever seen. The shootouts are hilarious and so is Kim Jong Il who has a solo of singing "Lonely, I'm So Lonely".  Absolutely hilarious, is how they make fun of America's "intelligence", which is depicted in the movie as a computer that sounds like a teenage stoner.  "There's no I in Team America" says the head of operations, (long pause), "Umm, yeah there is", says intelligence.  The list goes on and on of what they make fun of, including the depiction of various races and origins like Muslims, Asians, and Hispanics. The movie is a mess, the jokes come flying in hard and fast, it's rude, it's crude, it's one of the funniest things I have ever seen.<br /><br />ACTING: One of the movie's main continuing joke is actors, so naturally they use puppets instead. Most of the voices are done by Matt and Trey, a lot you will recognize from South Park, but still oh so painfully funny.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: This is one of the most entertaining movies ever made. If you think of this as just plain potty humor you are mistaken. So many political aspects of our world are attacked within the spoofs and satire, same goes for Hollywood. Very original and smart is what this movie is under all the outrageous stunts and scenes. You will be dead tired after this movie from laughing so much, and you will be laughing at it for quite some time after you walk out of the theater. By no means a work of art, but a brilliantly and comically crafted piece of pop culture entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>Any film that has the White House publicly denouncing it has to be big, doesn't it? Leave it up to Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of the consistently irrelevant South Park series on Comedy Central, to set off not only the radical politically-oriented activists of Hollywood, specifically Sean Penn who wrote an op-ed basically saying "f--- you" the film's creators, but the current administration at well. Though one has to agree with the White House's statement that the current war on terrorism is far from what one would call a comical matter, perhaps they were more irked about the look-alike of Bush in the film's poster. Whether they like to admit or not, many view President Bush this way, whether it be his supporter or detractors, and with Election Day less then three weeks away, perhaps its best if we all take some time off, relax, and divert our minds away from the current political climate if only for two hours.<br /><br />The story for Team America: World Police is a comical take on the current war on terrorism and how both sides of the political spectrum have viewed it since September 11th. Team America, the governing police force of the planet dedicated to bringing terrorists to justice any which way possible, learns, thanks to their computer network known as I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E., that a group of Middle-Eastern terrorists, under the control of communist dictator Kim Jong Il unbeknownst to the crime force, has gotten their hands on weapons of mass destruction, which they plan to use to bring chaos to the world. In order to stop them before they enact their devilish plan, Team America recruits a rising Broadway actor Gary Johnson, quite possibly the best in the business (with the exception of his hero, Alec Baldwin), to disguise himself as a Middle-Eastern terrorist and infiltrate the secret organization to unlock their plans. It's a race against time to stop the power hungry Kim Jong Il and bring an end to his fiendish plot before every country on the planet is brought into what he calls "the perfect balance". The story for Team America: World Police fails to exist, or at least longer then first thirty minutes of the feature, but, as was case with South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, the audience its intended for doesn't care that much as long as the film makes them laugh, which its sure to do, in one sick twisted way or another. Though Trey Parker and Matt Stone do take their jabs at the "arrogant" jerks of the world's police force, their true black vendetta seems to be squarely with the radical liberal activists in Hollywood. If you hate any one of these hippies, or you just enjoy seeing puppets blown up, this is definitely a must-see film, for the last twenty minutes at least. Here's one question to ponder though: What the Hell did Matt Damon do to piss these guys off? Michael Moore is understandable (besides being a socialist whiner, he apparently placed a cartoon in Bowling for Columbine that was made to look like it was done by the South Park guys, which it wasn't) but Matt Damon? How about them apples?!<br /><br />Another conventional concept Team America lacks is a generalized cast make-up - there may be a specific cast list on IMDB but considering it's a lengthy roster of individuals who few, if any in the general populous, know anything about, it isn't worth wasting ink over. But ditching cinematic canon isn't a new development for the South Park creators, so it isn't surprising for them to make their project work in spite of that clear fact. Gary Johnston, one of the best actors in the world, one who hides a dark secret he has kept since childhood, is the landmark hero of Team America and lampoons the basic "Ben Affleck-esque" heroes presented in the Bruckheimer extravaganzas such as Pearl Harbor (a film so bad the film dedicates a song to it) and Armageddon. There was one particular scene, more actually but in an effort to not give away too much we'll narrow it down to one, will have many people wrenching. At the beginning of the movie, Gary is discovered by the head of Team America in a Broadway stage show known as "Lease". "Lease", a take on the Broadway musical "Rent", features the song "Everybody has AIDs", and while it was intended as off the cuff humoristic take on the homosexuality of Broadway actors, it bordered on the line of  complete insensitivity and wasn't necessary. Sarah, whose finance is killed by a Middle-Eastern terrorist while on a mission in Paris, France, is the foxy team member that falls head over strings for Gary, though she desperately tries to fight it early on. The scene that will be talked about the most, whether it be at the water cooler or the high school lunch room, is the one that was under the most scrutiny when it was presented to the MPAA for the film's rating decision. There's no simple way to describe it other then to say it will either have you rolling on the floor laughing or racked with disgust. Just be forewarned, if you don't enjoy seeing puppets, or the more politically correct term would be the mechanically impaired, bang each other every which way for what seems like the longest twenty seconds in cinematic history, once you hear the words "I promise you I will never die" come from Gary's mouth, better cover your eyes quickly before being scarred for life. Chris, a no nonsense martial-arts expert, gives Team America the seriously needed attitude adjustment it deserves ("Let's make this interesting ... You lose!") and kicks major marionette butt in the process. Kim Jong Il, the vicious North Korean communist dictator, works extremely well when he's on screen, almost all of his scenes are gut-busters (both literally and figuratively), but he does have his fair share of problems. Specifically, the main problem is that he doesn't get as nearly enough screen time as he should. He's quite possibly the funniest character in the entire film, possibly because he sounds so much like Cartman from the South Park series, but only makes appearances sporadically throughout the feature. Granted this film is suppose to be about the heroes of Team America but with a villain as incomprehensible as Kim Jong Il, why not focus on him more? One can only hope more will appear in the unrated edition of the film's DVD release six months from now.<br /><br />Overall, Team America won't persuade anyone to vote for a particular candidate this November, which, if you're from a swing state, you're pretty much sick of both by now, but whether you're a "right-wing nut job" or a liberal "wiener", you'll find something to laugh at in this film, one side more then other. On the last episode of 60 Minutes, you know - the program that faked the Bush National Guard memos, Andy Rooney, for what seems like the first time in years, actually made sense when he stated that those who haven't decided who they are going to vote for in the upcoming presidential election by now are idiots. Though that may seem harsh, in essence, he's right and an impertinent comedy such as Team America: World Police should have no profound effect on anybody's political affiliation. As Trey Parker and Matt Stone themselves said upon releasing this film, if anyone comes out of this film, or a Michael Moore documentary, basing their political decisions on what they have just seen, they shouldn't be voting. This film is for pure entertainment purposes only and should not be taken seriously by anyone with a brain, let alone some decent common sense. Let's be frank - Team America: World Police is in no way shape or form a feature that should ever be viewed by children under the age of fifteen even with the consent of parents. There's enough foul language, vomit, excessive violence, and puppet sex to make the most immature high school flunky blush. The film, as irrelevantly hilarious as it may be at times, has its share of problems that make it far from being one of the best films of the year, let alone one of the top-rated comedies of the season. Team America seems to be betting too much on a one-trick pony - whether it be blowing everything up in site with as many big explosions as possible or doing stupid things, such as martial-art fighting, involving marionettes. What seems humorous at first eventually becomes amusing then cute ultimately falling into the area of just flat-out annoying and this is only after about forty minutes. Though it does work out in the end, this film should never have made into theaters and would have been bettered suited to a special presentation on either Comedy Central or HBO, and perhaps cut down by about thirty minutes. The parody of modern musicals may have worked brilliantly for South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut but it doesn't here almost at all. Though some of the songs are worth a few chuckles here and there, namely Kim Jong Il's "I'm so Lonely" (the online R-rated clip version was way better), they don't do anything for the film and really drag the film down. Bottom-line, if enjoy seeing mind-less peace-harping losers such as Michael Moore, Martin Sheen, Tim Robbins, Danny Glover, Helen Hunt, Matt Damon ("Matt Damon!"), and others getting smashed, bashed, and blown-up in anyway possible then this is the worth the price of at least matinee performance alone. With only three more weeks until four more years, take some time off from back-breaking political labor to relieve pressure from those infuriating fanatic left-wing activists.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YCG57S65QXUU.html">A2YCG57S65QXUU</a><br/><p>Team America: World Police is a action-comedy adventure created by the team of Matt Stone and Trey Parker, and done through the magic of marionette puppets. In this sick but brillant political satire, a team of American counter-terrorism fighters battle Islamic extremists throughout the world and giving uptight Hollywood celebrity activists their just desserts, all leading up to the climatic battle pitting Team America against the North Korean butthole dictator Kim Jong-Il. The special features includes a behind-the-scenes look of the film, how the puppets are made, the mini-pyrotechnics display and a closer look at the Kim Jong-Il character. Please note that since it is a unrated version(being the material is different from the R-rated version)of the movie, it not intended for children, it contains explicit language, graphic violence, strong sexual content with puppets and gross perverted humour.

There are a few good jokes (such as Sean Penn's vision of Saddam's Iraq as a Willy Wonkaland of chocolate rivers and lollipop trees) and it's almost refreshing to see an unashamedly right-wing comedy that picks solely on liberal targets in an age when Bush and co are just too easy targets, but it falls flat as satire by going for only the very softest targets and feels like an SNL sketch that somehow got dragged out to feature length. Indeed, comparison to Superthunderstingcar, the still breathtakingly brilliant 5-minute Dudley Moore and Peter Cook sendup of Thunderbirds from the mid-60s only heightens the film's shortcomings. Even the songs are at best only mildly amusing compared to the relentless comic genius on display in South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut. The production design and sets are quite magnificent, but there's not enough here for a one-off TV show let alone a feature. Forget the politics, this just ain't nearly funny enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>Pardon me while I wipe the tears away.  If you judge a film by the amount of copious fluids you excrete from your person then "Team America-World Police" is an outright masterpiece.  All kidding aside, this was the funniest film of 2004 and will inevitably achieve classic status.  This is probably the crowning moment of Parker and Stone's repertoire.  The beauty of this film is that I know both liberals and conservatives who are just as effusive in their fervor for this film.  The film's targets, global politics, Hollywood activism, high-voltage action films to name a few, are skewered brilliantly.  The puppets are stunning and expressive.  The miniature sets and visuals are breath-taking.  Like other Parker and Stone ventures the film has a great song score.  If you're not easily offended or have a slightly askew sense of humor "Team America" is the film for you.  Dirka, Dirka!</p></br><a href="../users/A30IP5D5DLHRPA.html">A30IP5D5DLHRPA</a><br/><p>Anyone that watches South Park know that Trey Stone and Matt Parker like to make adult political satires based on pop culture and contemporary politics with a no-holds-bar style of bashing.  Team America: World Police is not any different.<br /><br />In Team America, the patriotic soldiers of freedom (Namely, Team America) are depicted at reckless, overreacting, over-destructive soldiers despite their good intentions of protecting people.  In the first scene, they blow up Paris while trying to stop four terrorists, later they do the same in Cairo.  Kim Jong Il and the terrorists are portrayed in stereotypical fashion of Middle Eastern/Islamic males with turbans on their heads, spouting off idiotic sounding jibberish ("Durka, Durka!  Muhammed Jihad!!").  Kim Jong Il is quite comical in his role as he kills Hans Blix, hosts a peace rally and even breaks into song at one point.  The Hollywood celebs are depicted as... well, wusses.  People, that prefer to blame those who fight terrorism, rather than the terrorists themselves and even band together with Kim Jong Il to stop Team America.<br /><br />Now believe it or not, but this all serves a purpose to explain a sort of "balance" in the world between those who fight terrorism, those who sue for peace and those who oppose peace.  It's rather interesting, but this is a review, not a political commentary.<br /><br />Now politics aside, this movie is not for anyone under 17.  The jokes are rather crude, involving drunken vomiting, an explicit sex scene, blown up bodies, animals eating corpses, shark attack... all involving puppets.  Which makes it rather humorous in some areas, especially with the "Kung fu" fight scenes.  The puppet works is done extremely well in some scenss, but horribly done in others, which is supposed to make it funny.<br /><br />Team America was extremely funny when I first saw it in theatres.  I hit the floor laughing when Michael Moore... well, you'll just have to see.  However, the 2nd time around, it wasn't all that funny, especially after the tsunami incident in Asia.  It's mostly shock humor that loses it's taste to the general audience after the first showing.  Nonetheless, I still enjoyed this movie emensely and I recomend it to anyone that desires to see another side of the political spectrum.<br /><br />Be forewarned, this movie will probably offend you no matter what political idealogy you follow.  But do not let that ruin the experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>Absofrickinlutely hilarious!<br /><br />The sex scene was the biggest laugh in the film, and the songs are better than the bombastic movie songs they parody.<br /><br />"You can show it in a MONTAGE!!"<br /><br />When I saw it in the theater on a Friday night, there were only 10 of us there.

It's not quite as funny as Matt Stone and Trey Parker's "South Park," but it definitely takes some wonderful shots at worldwide politics, the French, and the countless, mindless idiots from Hollywood who think that everyone should think their way.<br /><br />The premise is simple, Team America travels the world stopping evil, whether it be Bin Laden or, as in this flick, Kim Jong Il.  They do so by literally blowing up everything in their path.  As the story unfolds, the team is duped by Kim Jong Il into seeking out multiple terrorist threats while he convinces the Film Actors Guild(F.A.G.) that he is actually seeking out world peace.  The F.A.G., headed up by blithering idiot Alec Baldwin, easily fall into his trap, not to mention the bulk of the world's leaders.  Meanwhile, at the Team America Headquarters inside Mount Rushmore, Michael Moore attempts to shut down their operations.<br /><br />As all of this is going on, we are given countless humorous and smart shots at Hollywood and politics.  The comedy is both bitter and cutting.  Also, as with the "South Park" movie, we are given a few nice songs, most notably Kim Jong Il's "Ronery" song and the hilarious Team America theme.<br /><br />Tolerance is always being screeched about by the schmucks in Hollywood, yet when they become the focus of smart humor, they get angry.  Perhaps they are the ones who need to learn a little about tolerance.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fans of "South Park" and to those who actually get the humor portrayed by this flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EBLL2OYEQJN9.html">A2EBLL2OYEQJN9</a><br/><p>To begin with, this film is admirable purely on its technical achievements.  The puppets are outstanding, and they often convey more complex facial expressions that many real actors do!  I found myself amazed at the realism of the faces and eyes of the puppets.  The soundtrack of custom songs is also great, especially "Freedom Isn't Free."<br /><br />The movie has two main plot elements:  a satire of action flicks and commentary on America's position as the world police.  The action flick satire is brilliant, especially as Team America sets off on mayhem and destruction in the name of police work, often causing more damage than the bad guys were going to do!  Your take on the war commentary will most likely depend on your personal views.<br /><br />I'm rating this film high because I admire it and I think there is an audience for it out there, but on a personal level, I thought it was drawn out just a bit too much.  It might have been better as an extended skit or a smaller bit, not a full length feature film.  South Park is superior humor and modern political/cultural commentary, in my opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LNWA25IM2DX.html">A9LNWA25IM2DX</a><br/><p>First of all and as it is announced on the cover of the DVD, this movie comes directly from the creators of `South Park'. So you can expect to see in this movie the same humor and irreverent jokes that gave fame to the show. The idea for this movie came up as a way to make fun of the Jerry Bruckheimer films, in which everything is action and we get to see things exploding all the time, and in the most crucial moments of the film, action is interrupted with a sentimental thing; well, all those things are here and believe me, you'll never see a Jerry Bruckheimer film the same ever again (if you get Parker and Stone's sense of humor) The idea of using puppets came from the creator's hate to actors, something they explain in the additional documentaries on this DVD.<br /><br />The story opens with Team America saving France from a terrorist attack with a weapon of mass destruction, one the members dies and it is time for them to find a replacement: an actor (wait till you listen to the reason, hilarious)<br /><br />From the very beginning the movie surprises with the level of detail of the scenarios and the characters, the production is unbelievable. Also we get to see that behind all the fart jokes and the simplest humor, there is always a sharp critique to the so called `American way'. Team America decides what's best for the world, even if that implies destroying every place they visit. Also the `Film Actors Guild' takes its share of critique, actors trying to pose as figures of influence are not an invention of these guys (Matt Damon is simply one of the funniest characters in this film); Michael Moore is also present in a fatal moment for the team. But the most interesting thing is to see Kim Jong Il portrayed as the villain (the song he sings is one of the most memorable moments of the movie); it is told that he is an avid movie collector, it would be interesting to know if he owns this movie and his opinion about it, but hey, these are the same guys that gave Jesus Christ a TV show! Can we expect them to respect someone? I don't think so.<br /><br />The musicals are present (even Broadway appears on the movie), the way the use the dramatic music is amazing (check it out when Gary vomits) and makes these moments even funnier, the dialogues are crazy (the foreign characters don't talk a thing and instead say things like `Ping pong' or `Derka derka muhamed ali') and the voices are as funny as the ones in South Park (most of them performed by Trey and Matt)<br /><br />The awkwardness of the puppets is the best humor resource used in this film, the way the puppets walk is way too funny (and this is done intentionally), the characters pointing at things and then missing, the `help signal' Gary has to make when he is in danger, all of those are quite simple things that will make you laugh it up.<br /><br />The movie is presented with English 5.1 surround, English and French 2.0, subtitles in English and Spanish. The documentaries included in relation with the making of the movie complement perfectly and explain the reasons behind the making of this movie and the whole creative process. The uncensored edition has a couple of scenes added to the sex sequence between the puppets, somehow resembling of the video of Cartman's mom in `South Park the movie'<br /><br />Bottom-line, a very interesting film in the way in which it was produced and a hilarious piece of comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9.html">A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9</a><br/><p>If parts of this movie don't make you laugh, NOTHING WILL!<br /><br />This is one sick movie! Not for the kiddies! You've got to<br /><br />see this movie, it's insane! F#*% YEAH!</p></br><a href="../users/A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ.html">A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ</a><br/><p>Once in a very great while, a movie comes along that is SO innovative, so original, so funny, and so creatively memorable that it stays with you long after the credits have rolled.<br /><br />I saw that movie last night, and it's called "Team America: World Police"!!<br /><br />Comedy hasn't seen much of these movies lately, but "Team America" certainly makes up for the gap in what I would say was definitely the most gut-busting, hilarious film spoof ever made for adults.<br /><br />This film is so priceless that I wouldn't dare include any spoilers, but here is a quick summary of events.<br /><br />Team America is a group of international crime fighters who always manage to get their man, and in the process; leave a path of total carnage and destruction in their path. When their next assignment calls for a little "espionage", they recruit "Gary", (a Broadway actor with demons of his own) to go undercover for them to fight the terrorists holding the weapons of mass destruction!!!<br /><br />Along the way, we learn all about loyalty, love, teamwork & betrayal: PUPPET STYLE!!<br /><br />This film was definitely made for adults, with plenty of action, profanity, gore, and hard core sex throughout the film. All done tastefully (yeah right!) of course. ;-)<br /><br />It also boasts one of the most fantastic and satirical scripts I have ever seen on film.<br />Matt Stone and Trey Parker take absolutely no prisoners as they tear into everything from the action, musical, horror, comedy, & adult film genres. There is also plenty of political humor in the film.<br /><br />Now for the puppets! These marionettes are so life-like it is stunning! The facial expressions are so detailed, yet in many scenes, the puppeteers actually spoof themselves by staying true to original puppeteer style. The walk and move like old fashioned puppets on a string, but the technology of them as a whole (especially there faces and costumes) is top of the line.<br /><br />This is a full blown action film. It is filmed just the way any big budget Hollywood epic is filmed (think Day After Tomorrow, or Independence day ), with the real difference being that this movie is actually GOOD!<br /><br />All the sets in "Team America" are meticulously crafted, and are splendid eye candy for the audience. The explosions and pyrotechnics are top-notch, and much better to watch in this movie than in the crappy action films that Hollywood regularly churns out by the dozen each year.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about "Team America: World Police" !  This is a 10 star film if there ever was one. I had to pause the movie 3 times while I was watching it because I was literally crying with tears of laughter. I will say that this film is completely adult oriented, and parents will need to choose carefully if allowing their children to watch.<br /><br />If you collect DVD's, this is a movie that MUST go into your collection. I never saw the R rated theater version, but the unrated and uncensored version is the way to go if renting or purchasing, because many, many scenes had to be thrown out for the MPAA to give "Team America" its R rating. On the uncut version, we get to see this film in all its glory.<br /><br />I will watch this movie repeatedly, and can not wait to see it again. As the theme song so eloquently states:<br />"America... F**K YEAH"!!!<br /><br />HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!<br /><br />GOD BLESS YOU TREY AND MATT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3IE0P2JMWW0H7.html">A3IE0P2JMWW0H7</a><br/><p>The film, which features a cast entirely composed of marionettes, focuses on a fictional team of polictical policemen (like Storm Troppers) known as "Team America: World Police," who attempt to save the world from a violent terrorist plot led by Kim Jong-il.<br /><br />Trey Parker and Matt Stone who are also known for the popular animated series South Park. The film is a parody of action films and their associated cliches and stereotypes, the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the resulting war, with particular humorous emphasis on the global implications of American politics {wikipedia}<br /><br />Graphic violence, excessive swearing, sex scene, more violence, destruction of Paris, France and Cairo, Eygpt... what more more do you want??</p></br><a href="../users/A1J66TA573ZPRX.html">A1J66TA573ZPRX</a><br/><p>Funny, Funny, Funny.

Never thought the muppets could kill or have sex than again I never really thought about either of those until I saw this, but hey you never know if these puppets can kill and have sex than the muppets and any other ones can do pretty much anything.  I didnt get see it in the movies even thought Ive been working at the movies since July.  But o well.  Its funny.

The great thing about the film is that it is absolutely heedless of who it offends or takes shots at.  And believe me, it has something offensive for everyone.<br /><br />In short, it details the misadventures of a group of anti-terrorist Americans, working out of a supersecret  homebase in the middle of Mt. Rushmore.  These gung-ho heroes hunt down terrorists wherever they find them.  In the opening sequence, the team descends on Paris to wipe out some terrorists with a WMD in a briefcase.  While they DO take out the terrorists, they also manage to destroy the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre and the Arch d Triumphe.  Certainly they do more damage to Paris than the bomb in the suitcase.  Later, they destroy the Pyramids and the Sphinx stopping another group of terrorists.  The point is obviously that these deeply right-wing nuts are alienating the world, blundering into situations without regard for consequences, etc. etc.  So, we think the movie is bashing the supposedly extremist Bush-administration.<br /><br />But then, when we learn the Kim Jong Il of North Korea has a huge plan for basically disrupting all of civilization (mostly so he gets a little attention), the tables turn - very pointedly making fun of all the celebrities and their peace-mongering.  Alec Baldwin, Tim Robbins, George Clooney and on and on are shown as knee-jerk liberals who can't even make a cogent case against Team America...except to say something about "big corporations."<br /><br />So the creators of the movie play fair...everyone is skewered.  Although I would have to say that in the end, the left wing is more soundly skewered, primarily because all the celebrities are dispatched in the most horrifically violent and amusing ways possible.<br /><br />Among other joys are the most lengthy and graphic projectile vomiting in film history (giving Monty Python's The Meaning of Life a run for its money), a very graphic sex scene, and some wonderful songs that make fun of everything from Michael Bay's PEARL HARBOR to the current wave of country-western pro-American songs.<br /><br />Oh, and of course, it's all done with puppets.  This makes virtually every clich&eacute; the movie indulges in very funny instead of clich&eacute;d.  (Hey, he's giving a clich&eacute;d "rah-rah" speech...but he's a puppet, so it's funny.)<br /><br />My wife and I (both in our early 40s) had tears running down our faces during much of this movie.  It's so over-the-top, so shocking and yet so right on the money about most of the subjects it pokes fun at.  To really enjoy it, I think, you have to have some idea of current affairs.  If you don't understand that during the last election, a big group of celebrities worked really hard to prevent Bush from being reelected, you might wonder why all these celebrities go to North Korea.  If you don't know who Hans Blix, the UN weapons inspector, is...you won't understand the scene he's in.<br /><br />Also, folks, please don't take little kids to this.  It's packed with so much cussing, so much racist humor, so much graphic sex and so much adult humor (in the best possible sense), that I really think a 10-year old might be scarred for life!  But if you're an older teen or an adult with a strong stomach...have a great time.  This movie is certainly in my top 5 movies of 2004, and in my top 20 best comedies of all time.  (And I don't even like South Park much.)</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I was trying to figure out if Trey Parker and Matt Stone were mainly going after George W. Bush or Alec Baldwin in "Team America: World Police," but it turns out their real targets were Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer (the song "'Pearl Harbor' Sucked and I Miss You" was a big clue).  You think that the Bush doctrine of military intervention is being lampooned, but the guy on the suicide mission wearing the dynamite belt is Michael Moore and there are almost as many liberals killed by Team America as there are terrorists (but I might be wrong on that score as I gave up counting dead bodies in movies ever since "MAD" did the bit about Clint Eastwood in "Where Eagles Dare").<br /><br />The movie starts off with its best sequence as Team America shows up in Paris to save the City of Lights from terrorists with a weapon of mass destruction.  Team America succeeds, but pays a price as one of their members is killed.  Also, there is some collateral damage, but the important thing is that the terrorists were stopped so everybody should just shut up and be grateful (not necessarily in that order).  What we then have is the introduction of the new team member and a whole bunch of standard action movie scenes, only acted out by marionettes following a script written by Parker, Stone and Pam Brady<br /><br />What I can do is assure you that you will be offended by "Team America" at some point during this unrated and uncensored version (I can totally understand why the movie was heading for a NC-17 rating on the basis of two shots during the semi-infamous marionettes having sex scene).  But it is not Parker and Stone unless they go too far and that is certainly preferred to not going far enough (for proof, watching "Saturday Night Live" the next time it is on).  So there are moments when you will laugh yourself silly and other moments where you need to worry about what will come flying out of your mouth if you are not carefully given the visual inspiration provided by the film.<br /><br />Probably the only person who comes out looking good in this movie is Gerry Anderson, the guy who came up with "Thunderbirds" using the process of "Supermarionation," which gets the big screen treatment here (unlike, ironically, the recent "Thunderbirds" theatrical film).  There are some good gags based on treating the puppets like puppets, but the main laughs come at the expense of the action film genre.  You cannot get through the opening titles without having a bunch of explosives and while there are plenty of funny songs the use of heroic music to pump up the fake bonding moments and emotional travails are actually funnier.  I also liked the juxtaposition of interpersonal revelations with explosions as the team finally sorts out who likes whom.  This is not as great as "South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut," but it is the closest that Parker and Stone have come to date, which would be one of those good things you hear about from time to time.<br /><br />The cinematography is by Bill Pope, who shot the "Matrix" films but is a fan of "South Park" and tired of shooting blue screens.  The production design by Jim Dultz, the art direction by John Berger and Tom Valentine, and the set direction by Fontaine Beauchamp Hebb and Richard C. Walker is pretty impressive for a puppet movie and the featurettes will get you to go back and pore over the movie scene by scene to see what interesting things you can spot in this 1/3 scale world.  That will serve you a lot better than trying to figure out the impolite politics of this film.  I am toying with the idea that maybe the film is an attack on the Bush Administration by embracing the use of force and killing all the activist actors.  Or maybe Parker and Stone just do not like actors.  They certainly do not like Kim Jong Il, but then who does?</p></br><a href="../users/A3N5XIM9R2OQH0.html">A3N5XIM9R2OQH0</a><br/><p>If you're tired of the seemingly endless parade of tired genre films, adaptations, and remakes coming out of Hollywood these days, Team America: World Police may be just what you need to shake you out of your bad movie-induced slumber.  Coming from Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the twisted minds behind the enduring classic that is South Park, Team America is a bloody, profanity-laced, sexually perverted comic romp of a movie, the kind sure to offend prudes and morality police everywhere.  Not to mention, all the filth, violence, and depravity that this movie contains (and there's plenty of it) occurs against the backdrop of the grandiosely titled War on Terror, as we witness the enduring struggle between America and its enemies played out on the world stage.  Yes, Trey and Matt have devoted an entire movie to delivering their own skewed take on the battle that has captivated Americans for almost four years now.  And they've done it all with a cast consisting entirely of marionettes.<br /><br />Arrayed on one side is Team America, standing alone to police the world and defend freedom from the fanatical terrorists who seek to bring down civilization.  Their skills are unparalleled, and they're aided by a vast array of special "valmorphanizing" weapons and vehicles.  Consisting of a former All-American quarterback, an empath, a psychologist, and of course the finest martial artist Detroit has to offer, Team America is an elite group made virtually unstoppable by the guidance of their no-nonsense supervisor Mr. Spotswood and the omniscient supercomputer I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E..  They travel the world seeking out their enemies wherever they may hide, and causing lots of nifty explosions in the process.  Sure, the French and the Egyptians may not appreciate Team America's efforts too much when they blow up the The Louvre and the Eiffel Tower in the former country and the Sphinx and the Great Pyramid in the latter, but hey, somebody's got to take responsibility for keeping the free world safe.<br /><br />After a member's death in the movie's opening sequence, Team America is forced to look outside the group for help, and Spotswood manages to find them the perfect weapon: Gary Johnston, a "maverick renegade" of a Hollywood actor with a degree in theater and world languages that will enable him to infiltrate the deepest corners of the terrorist underworld.  Gary is such a convincing actor that his made-up tale of suffering at the hands of the American infidels brings tears to the eyes of even the most hardened terrorists.  And while he initially doesn't want the guilt, shame, and responsibility that come with his position, by the end he's undergone such a transformation that he's willing to service his boss in the name of freedom.<br /><br />On the other, darker side of the equation is Kim Jong-Il, the diminutive Korean dictator plotting a terrorist strike that will be equal to 911 times 2,356 (do the math).  Parker and Stone really did their homework when it came to portraying Kim (they confess to being fascinated by him in the DVD's special features), and what comes out is sort of a combination of Eric Cartman, Josef Stalin, and a bulk-rate James Bond Villain, with the accent of the Chinese restaurant owner from South Park.  Kim cuts a menacing figure, and clearly has no qualms about cold-blooded murder, but as we learn in one of the greatest songs in movie history, he's really just "ronery" (i.e., lonely) and smarting from a lack of respect.  In other words, he's the kind of movie villain you love to hate, only a lot funnier than most.<br /><br />Perhaps even more ominously, though, Kim has enlisted the aid of "secret weapon" Alec Baldwin and his parnters in the Film Actors Guild (in case you can't figure out the acronym, it's prominently mentioned and displayed on numerous occasions).  Led by Baldwin, the Guild is composed of the kind of people who truly understand global politics, namely famous movie actors who can read newspapers and then repeat what they've read as though it's their own opinion.  World-class whiner and useless troll Michael Moore even makes an appearance as a hot dog-waving, mumbling domestic terrorist.  Unfortunately, Kim's devious mind formulates a fiendish plan to use the Guild to further his plans to throw the world into chaos, and only Team America can stop him.  But first, Gary & Co. have to overcome the dark secrets, resentments, and hidden and unrequited loves that threaten to tear them apart.<br /><br />So, what works in Team America?  Fortunately, just about everything.  South Park long ago revealed Parker and Stone as insightful social critics as well as top-notch filth merchants, and Team America ultimately proves to be a fast-paced and consistently hilarious examination of world politics when it's not brilliantly spoofing the action-movie genre.  South Park has seen Parker and Stone generally leaning to the right of center of the American political spectrum, but they've also show a willingness to take the piss out of anyone's deeply held beliefs, and this movie is no exception.  Those on the left, those on the right, and those who just plain hate politics should find a lot to laugh at here.<br /><br />Early on there's plenty of mockery of American ignorance and arrogance: Gary's "transformation" into an Arab terrorist consists of little more than sticking some dark hair plugs on his face; the Panana Canal is described as "2,193 miles south of the real America"; team members gleefully blow up priceless buildings and monuments and expect the natives to be grateful.  There are also some transcendently stupid parodies of the trite jingoistic anthems that sprung up in droves after the September 11 attacks ("Freedom Costs a Buck-Oh-Five"; "America, F*** Yeah.").  About halfway through, though, the movie shifts gears and launches into a sustained assault on the "elites" of Hollywood and the U.N..  Of course, since Stone was once quoted as saying "I hate conservatives, but I really f***ing hate liberals," this should come as no surprise.  In one rather telling moment, famed weapons inspector Hans Blix exemplifies the impotence of international governing bodies when he tells Kim that refusal to disclose North Korea's weapons program will result in an angry letter from the U.N..  And of course, there are countless sendups of the ignorance of Hollywood liberals, with Tim Robbins babbling incoherently about corporations and Matt Damon saying nothing more than his own name.<br /><br />Now, none of the above would matter if Team America weren't an uproariously funny comedy, but it succeeds wildly on that score as well.  The political humor often takes center stage, but there's still more than enough of the explicit banter and graphic imagery that fans of Parker and Stone have come to expect.  The sex scene between two marionettes has gained much of the attention that this movie generated, and rightfully so: at about two minutes in length, performed to the tune of an appropriately wretched power ballad and filled with positions that are just plain wrong, it's more than worth getting the uncensored edition for.  If you're weak of stomach you may want to take a bathroom break during the extended vomiting scene, though.<br /><br />An any rate, by the time Team America ends with a brutally funny and surprisingly accurate summation of America's role in the world that's far too explicit for me to repeat in this space, it's clear that we have a comedy classic on our hands.  In an age of rampant political correctness and the looming threat of censorship from the sorry likes of the Parents Television Council and similar busybodies, it's good to see someone (or someones) pushing the limits of good taste and creating something intelligent and truly funny in the process.  Increasingly sanitized and enstupidated fare may be the norm coming out of Hollywood now, but in such a climate films like this one only stand out even more.  Trey and Matt, my hat's off to you once again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2URG8OHNEDS.html">A1R2URG8OHNEDS</a><br/><p>"Team America: World Police" is the new movie from Matt Stone and Trey Parker. If you never heard of them before, they are the creators of "South Park." That is an animated show, that started off with small pieces of construction paper. This one could also be considered an animated movie, except it is done with puppets. Everyone and everything is part of this puppet world, and although the movie is about the war on terrorism, it never touches the government. There is no puppet version of President George W Bush or Saddam Hussain. This movie hits the war from the point of the actors that really think they could make a difference. Actors like Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and even Micheal Moore, who actually causes all of the trouble. The villan is even the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Il, who is using this actors in order to lead the terrorists to victory. Matt Stone and Trey Parker are the funniest people around right now, and everything about this movie is funny, and raunchy. The commericals don't really have anything funny, but that is because everything that is funny can't be shown on television. Everything that we think is funny, is funnier because of the puppets. They fight by bumping into each other, they could be in a serious scene, and then they walk away, but the way they walk into straight, or proper at all. You could do whatever you want with puppets. You could fill them up with as much fake blood as you want, or even liquid that looks like vomit. But, it's alot of work, and I don't think that they would ever try to do it again.<br /><br />The movie begins in Paris, and the terrorists have plotted a bomb. Luckily, Team America is ready, and they go to Paris to destory the terrorists, while also destorying Paris. They stopat nothing to defeat evil. They meet in Mount Rushmore, led by Spottswoode, and there is Carson, Lisa, Chris, Joe, and Sarah, and just as Carson proposes to Lisa, he is shot and killed by a terrorist. With the loss of Carson, they must replace him with somebody who could pretend to be a terrorist, so they hire Gary, a Broadway actor, who is known for the hit song "Everyone Has AIDS." He doesn't want the job, but when he realizes that "Freedom Isn't Free" he takes it. He dresses up as a terrorists, filled with facial hair, and heads over to the Middle East. But Kim Jong Il is really the villan, and he is using the Hollywood actors to get the terrorist activity around  the world. As Lisa doesn't want to get attached to another person for fear of losing him, strife comes to the Team America headquarters. What makes things worse is the headquarters gets hit with a bomb, and the Team America gang gets captured, and it's up to Gary to save the day.<br /><br />As I said, everything is funnier when it is done with puppets, and sex is not an exception. There is a hilarious graphic puppet sex scene that takes about forty five seconds long. It was edited a few times, so hopefully on the DVD we could see everything. This movie is not a movie where Matt or Trey voice their beliefs about the war, but it is a movie that is about them thinking that actors think they are better then everybody else, and that they know more. I love what they do to them, and I love all the movie references. I'm sure somethings went over my head, and that means other people too, but you have to always pay attention during this movie. Even the song lyrics have comedy in them, and I love the lament of Kim Jong Il. It fits it perfectly. "Team America: World Police" is a great movie, and it is the funniest of the year. Matt Stone and Trey Parker are geniuses.<br /><br />And remember. . . America! F**k yeah!<br /><br />ENJOY!<br /><br />Rated R for graphic, crude & sexual humor, violent images & strong language, all involving puppets.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>When you combine South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone with a horde of marionettes, what do you get?  Team America: World Police begins with an elite counter terrorism squad recruiting a broadway actor who has a tragic past.  As the film unfolds, Team America comes under fire from protesting Hollywood types, as well as evil dictator Kim Jong Il, who has set in motion a plan to destroy every major city in the world.  Oh yeah, in the middle of all this, the viewer is shown two of these puppets going at it, which is one of the most irreverant and hilarious things you'll ever see.  Offensive to no end, deliberately politically incorrect and tongue in cheek, and one of the funniest films to be released in some time, Team America finds Parker and Stone crafting something other than a seemingly one trick pony animated show.  Deliriously funny, Team America isn't for everyone, but for fans of the South Park creators and absurd comedy, this is something really special and surprisingly smart.</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>(If you don't know why I signaled out this movie for the title of my review, watch this film and listen to one of the songs & you will see why).<br /><br />"Team America: World Police" is the brainchild of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of "South Park". Right from the first scene, Stone and Parker's touch is extremely evident: this film is offensive, vulgar and disgusting, but at the same time, it's so repulsively funny. Granted, I've never seen an episode of "South Park", but if it's anything like this movie, I think I'll enjoy it.<br /><br />"Team America: World Police" tells the story of a special police force that is bent on protecting America, even if it means destroying the Eifel Tower. (And did I mention all the characters are puppets?). When their M - like boss Spotswood learns of an attack put together bu various terrorist organizations,, he recruits Broadway star Gary Johnston to help the team by going the fictional Middle Eastern city Durka Durkastan and infiltrating the terrorists and saving the world,. The plan works flawlessly (and hilariously), or so it seems. Gary and his teammate Lisa fall deeply in love with each other, culmianting int he much publicized sex scene (which is longer thanks to the unrated version). They soon learn that the attack is far from over, and has been planned by North Korean dictator Kimg Jong Ill (who is hilariously). There are some very funny moments included in this film, including:<br /><br />-A two minute vomiting sequence that  is truly gross but extremely hilarious.<br /><br />-A retarted Matt Damon (one of the many liberal celebrities that are lampooned in this movie.<br /><br />-The sex scene (like you didn't see that coming).<br /><br />-The scene where Gary needs to prove his trust to Spotswood.<br /><br />Perhaps the funniest aspect of the movie, however, are the songs. These includce the theme song, "Only A Woman", "Freedom Isn't Free", "The Pearl Harbor Sucks Song", "You Are Worhtress Arec Barrwin", Ill's "I'm So Ronery", "Montage" and the uproraious "Rent" sendup (however, I find it a little disturbing that, for the dvd release, they left in the line "the pope has got it and so do you" in the wake of the tragic passing of the pope).<br /><br />My advice is plain and simple: if you enjoy lauhing, you will enjoy "Team America: World Police".</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>This is about the best that sophomoric humor gets. You know all the basics by now: it's marionettes, bumbling fighters for some kind of justice, and R-rated for - well, for lots of good reasons.<br /><br />It's also insanely funny. This is decidedly a product of Pres. Bush II, and generally lampoons the West Man's Burden that the US has taken on itself. It also ribs just about every stereotype around, using both its musical pieces ("Lonely" and "Montage" had me rolling) and its send-ups of dozens of other movies. Those included the original Thunderbirds TV show, Charlie's Angels, The Karate Kid, James Bond, The Matrix, and bunches of others. I couldn't always pick out a specific film being lampooned, but the mood was familiar and true whether or not I knew what it satirized.<br /><br />Two facts really stuck out in watching this. First was how well the puppets and scenes (wait for Il's panthers!) were put together. Second was that appreciation of the crude humor (gross-outs, homophobia, and all) split my viewing room down the middle, male vs. female. I spent a fair bit of time trying to explain why the country-western lyrics were so riotous. Have you ever tried to explain a joke? It was one of those, but bad.<br /><br />It's the best "adult" potty-humor animation since those scenes in Flesh Gordon. If you believe that even more time should have passed since then, skip Team America. If you're willing to sink to its level, though, it can be a lot of fun.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>Team America isn't a bad movie, though it's not really a good movie either.  On the positive side I liked how politically incorrect it was and how anti-Hollywood as well.  Parker and Stone can also be given marks for originality by the whole theme of the movie which is a spoof of action movies using marionettes a la Gerry Anderson.  The bad side is the same thing that made the South Park movie disappointing.  The fact that they milk one joke over and over again for 90 minutes.  In South Park it was cutesy cartoons swearing, in Team America it's puppets swearing, killing one another, etc.  A puppet using the F word is a pretty dang funny idea the first few times you hear it, but grows stale very fast, like back in school when you'd ask some chick if she wanted to join the Pen15 club.  It's got it's share of clever sequences like the Montage spoof.  The Team America theme song is  a funny spoof of the kinds of theme songs you'd hear in 80s cartoons like GI Joe.  All in all Team America may try too hard, but you do have to admire the against-the-grain approach.  Plus you have to give it credit for not being a remake of anything.

An over-the-top send-up of action films and politics it almost always hits its gag target for a good laugh.<br /><br />The puppet work is excellent and very expressive and the characters are voiced so well that at times you forget that you are watching marionettes.<br /><br />The sex scene is absolutely histerical as is the finale in South Korea.  Highly recommended if you have a twisted sense of humor and a strong stomach.</p></br><a href="../users/ABX7SEE84DMLU.html">ABX7SEE84DMLU</a><br/><p>If you are offended easily, please avoid this movie.  It sets an express objective of offending as many different people and kinds of people as possible.  And it succeeds.<br /><br />Surprisingly, though, not as many reviewers below discuss the tour de force of puppet usage, a la "The Thunderbirds."<br /><br />It's a shame.  What these guys did with cutout construction paper on TV, they attempt with puppets here.  The total artistic control puppets afford them is not squandered.  They use this medium to express their contempt for everything and everybody.  But what's new is...<br /><br />Artistry.  Just as "South Park" might work because it is firmly visually anti-artistic, they attempt "art within art" on this film.  The special features (which are pretty good, actually) go into great detail about what went into this movie:  sets, decorations, real pyro...no or very little CG.<br /><br />And these marvelous puppets.  Strangely enough, the movie sort of does not work unless you watch the special features.  They had to "dumb down" the puppet movements to make comedic points.  And what a shame, because the capabilities of these puppets are absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />In a weird way, this film reminded me of Alfred Hitchcock's "Rope:"  a technical experiment which because a near obsession.  And, in our case here, a rebellion against movemaking techniques which have brought to perfection the computer creation of a convincing alternate reality, like Star Wars Episode 3.<br /><br />Viewed with that discipline in mind, this is a fantastic movie.<br /><br />Just like viewing "Rope" and knowing about the 10-minute take.<br /><br />However, as entertainment, it's mediocre like Rope, in this case because it indulges in gross humor and cheap jokes.  My hat's off to the fellows for the near-historic technical exercise, but man, I couldn't watch this thing twice.<br /><br />Cartman's right.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BLITJITO97N5.html">A2BLITJITO97N5</a><br/><p>There certainly are funny parts in this movie and the satirical attacks on liberal Hollywood actors and actresses who think they have something worthwhile to say about politics are priceless. That being said, the crude vulgarity factor of the film is high (and disgusting). The "F" bomb is dropped so much that I was turned off. Body function scenes don't win Oscars from me either, so the film lost some stars from me over this, also. This could have been so much better if it had been less of a gross-out film and more of a satire.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SCD2NYTIAQTY.html">A1SCD2NYTIAQTY</a><br/><p>When I first heard of this movie, I thought it would be just another try-hard Thunderbirds imitation. Oh, how wrong I was! How very wrong! Puppets, yes. Kids, definitely not.<br /><br />The basic story follows an actor in his new life as a member of Team America, (the other member was killed in Paris). The Team are on the case of North Korean Kim Jong Il, and his plot to destroy the world, with the assistance of Alec Baldwin and the Film Actors Guild, (FAG).<br /><br />In the process, this film offends just about everyone, while following the violent and ludicrously funny exploits of Team America. This movie takes puppets and comedy to whole new levels in violence and sensuality, (if you can call it that). The laughs just keep coming relentlessly. Kim Jong Il's serenade about being so lonely is funny, and that is about as sensitive as it gets.<br /><br />The rest is in-your-face satire that is not too subtle, (a sledeghammer comes to mind). It is gratuitously violent, which just adds to the mayhem and laughter, and there is a fair amount of vomit as well. Refined culture is not a big thing for this movie as it pokes fun at just about everything and everyone.<br /><br />I have rarely laughed so hard in my life, and my tear ducts were soon dry. It was almost embarrassing choking in public. This movie is a must! It is awesome!<br /><br />Just don't take the kids, ok?</p></br><a href="../users/ANEDXRFDZDL18.html">ANEDXRFDZDL18</a><br/><p>I honestly didn't know what to expect when I saw Team America. For some reason, I thought it would be a serious `kids style' action movie with a few funny grown up lines thrown in for the adults.  Well, you can imagine my surprise at seeing a parody of a parody. With puppets... Parodying puppets, actors, and serious real life events! And I LOVED it! Seriously, there wasn't anyone in the theater who wasn't laughing themselves silly with the gross, irreverent, and at times shocking humor and wacky and outrageously wicked events.<br /><br />This film is NOT  for the kiddies. I repeat. NOT for the kiddies. Or for those who are overly sensitive. There were a few scenes that embarrassed even me (such as the lisping dictator character), and the scene where one of the puppets shared a past traumatic event that happened in the backstage of Cats. Eww....The odd thing was...Even though these characters were mere puppets...I ended up caring about them. I wanted the farm boy puppet to get together with the Lucy Liu look-alike, and I cared whether they lived and died towards the end.<br /><br />This was a shockingly wicked film, with some amazing puppeteering that I quite honestly didn't expect to like! 5 stars! I laughed throughout the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>Although not as funny as "South Park - Bigger, Longer and Uncut,"  this is an entertaining spoof of action movies, with pointed jabs at both the jingoistic Right and the clueless, self-important Hollywood Left.  Production is quite elaborate for a puppet movie, with elaborate sets and lots of explosions. Definitely worth watching if you won't get offended by LOTS of bad language, fairly graphic puppet sex, and some equally graphic violence.</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>Well, South Park has gone Thunderbirds in this puppet comedy by Trey Parker. Team America are an already established group of freedom fighters who are fighting terrorisim around the world, and new recruit "whats his face" is having some trouble adjusting.<br /><br />Much like the original Thunderbirds series, this is a bit of a poke at a few movies, Thunderbirds / Star Wars I picked up on easily, theres probably more.<br /><br />The movie like I said is a lot like South Park, even the same SP voices are heard all through the film. I have to say, I expected Trey and Matt to come up with somethign absolutly hilarious with this film. Sure, it did have a great speach at the end, and a funny love making scene with 2 of the puppets, but I truely think they couldve made it a much funnier movie, cause at times, it was...well, almost like a serios movie!!! I dont know if thats a compliment or insult to Trey?!<br /><br />Overall, it's an ok film, I hope when it's on DVD there is tonnes of bonus features that will get my thumbs up to buy.<br /><br />======<br /><br />Update: 7th June 2005<br /><br />I've just watched TA on DVD and it looks and sounds great. I kind of missed the point that it was meant to be an action film more then comedy, so i guess i was in a state of miss interpreting on my first reveiw. The movie is fun, but I still find it a 3 and half star comedy. I understand now that it had a huge production and wasnt the easiest of films to make, but i do agree with something Trey and Matt say in the bonus features, it was definitly time to make a movie that didnt use CGI and go back to an old school process, and i couldnt agree more.<br /><br />The extras are a bunch of featurettes, ranging from storyboaring, intervewis, behind the scenes etc, plus the usual trailers, and some deleted scenes that arnt hard to work out why they where cut out. But i'm a bit disapointed, I thought Try and Matt would have some ideas for hilarious extras, like interveiws with the puppets, or an actual deleted Jabba The Hut scene that Trey is always going on about as a joke whenever he can. And i'm very suprised there is no audio commentary.<br /><br />Still a good movie to own, gonnah be interesting watching it from now on and looking for little props made of things lying around the house!</p></br><a href="../users/A1U6B2LDK3BUVU.html">A1U6B2LDK3BUVU</a><br/><p>The first half hour of the first South Park movie was one of the funniest half hours I have ever seen on film.  It had me laughing so hard I hurt my ribs.  Team America had a lot to live up to.<br /><br />There are some big laughs in this one too.  The single funniest laugh is during a love scene between two of the Team America members, where these puppets are doing everything to each other short of getting out the whips and chains.  At first the scene is just funny, but then it gets so stupid and hysterical.  I'm not going to tell you what they do to each other.<br /><br />It has to be difficult to maintain the energy and humor over a full length movie.  The first South Park movie couldn't do it, but gave us an amazing beginning.  This movie doesn't rise to those heights, ever.  Despite having maybe about a dozen really funny parts in it, it really didn't keep me entertained enough to give it a rave review.<br /><br />One thing I give it credit for is being completely "politically incorrect".  It is the most right wing comedy ever made, and any reviewer who claims otherwise is lying.  To say that this is even handed or middle of the road is just a flat out lie.  It is as right wing as it can be, to the point of ridiculing every left wing actor they can think of and describing them all as fags.  This movie is Newt Gingrich on ecstasy.<br /><br />I don't care.  Comedies are supposed to make you laugh, so who cares what political position they take.  It had me laughing out loud a bunch of times, but overall I can't really give it more than about 2 stars.  Maybe 2 1/2.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Parody has the purpose of imitating in detail to achieve humor or to mock.  Sometimes mockery is frowned upon, if the sole purpose is to hurt the individual through ridicule.  This ridicule is also a source of laughter, as it could also be a form of criticism.  The criticism is to express a discontent with what has been expressed prior to the parody.  Thus, parody is essential for free speech and the freedom to express ones own thoughts and ideas.  Team America: World Police pushes the envelope in regards to parody, as it pokes fun of the American tapestry under the Bush administration's era with the help of puppets.<br /><br />The first half of the film provides hilarious outtakes from notions and similar events that have taken place in the world, and the perceptions of Americans throughout the world.  The film begins in Paris where some terrorists, Middle-Eastern looking puppets, plan to strike Paris with Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).  Fortunately, or should the Parisians say unfortunately, Team America arrives to save the day while also succeeding in blowing up the Eiffel Tower and the Triumph Arch.  This is a funny, yet a bloody event while Team America blows away the terrorists without consideration for art or history in Paris.  This is a view many outside the United States have of Americans, uncultured and with poor knowledge of history.  And to balance this out, the filmmakers make fun of other nationalities through caricature.<br /><br />One of the outcomes of the Paris event led to the death of one of the members of Team America.  Consequently, the leader for Team America, Spottswoode, decides to recruit Gary Johnston, a Broadway actor, who currently performs in the musical Lease, which has an obvious hint towards the musical Rent.  Spottswoode believes that they need Gary's acting skills to get close to the terrorists, as Gary graduated from Iowa University summa cum laude with a double major in theater and world languages.  The recruiting process includes convincing Gary to join Team America, which in itself provides an amusing scene where Spottswoode tries to induce fear in him.  However, it does not affect Gary who goes to Washington D.C. to ponder his decision among the war memorials of fallen men and women.<br /><br />Through the second half, the story increasingly turns away from parody toward what seems to be a MTV production that tries to rely on the shock value of things while heavily borrowing from other sources.  Much of this is amusing in a cruel way.  Some examples of the borrowing turn up when Team America arrives to Cairo, Egypt where Gary enters the terrorists' bar.  This bar has strong resemblance with Jabba the Hutt's place in Star Wars: The Return of the Jedi (1983).  Another amusing scene appears when Gary first arrives to the Team America headquarters in Mount Rushmore, which seems more like the first episode of a new season of MTV's Real World.  A final example is the North Korean president, Kim Jong Il, who seems to be more like a James Bond villain who terminates the Swedish Top UN weapon's inspector Dr. Hans Blix through feeding him to sharks among many other things.<br /><br />Freedom of speech brings filmmakers such as Trey Parker a certain level of social responsibility.  This notion seems to have been utterly crushed in the film, as Trey Parker and Matt Stone throw their characters into explicit violence and sex.  Yet, these scenes are not what are most offending in the film. Several ideas surface throughout the film; however, the director Trey Parker and writer Matt Stone never even try to explore any of these ideas.  They simply spew out their discontent in an extremely hostile, yet comical manner, which leaves the viewer with unfinished thoughts of violence and intolerance toward different thinkers.<br /><br />One major part of the film is the use of numerous known film stars such as Matt Damon, Sean Penn, and Alec Baldwin.  These stars join under Baldwin who is the leader for the Film Actors Guild (F.A.G.), which Parker and Stone seem to use suggestively in a prejudicial jovial manner.  The sole purpose of the actors appears to be for target practicing, as Parker develops a full out assault on them by killing them in various gruesome ways.  This suggests that is ok to threaten or even exercise violence towards those that freely express themselves, which goes against the notion of freedom.<br /><br />Maybe Parker thought that the idea of using puppets would limit the ideas and thoughts that he provided in the film, as the strings control puppets.  This might be a symbolic gesture toward how people are being manipulated; yet this idea was never fully developed.  Jan Svankmajer's film offers strong and bizarre material through puppets and clay, yet his films are thoughtful in regards to society even though disturbing.  Nonetheless, the discontent is obvious, to point of nihilism, which Ebert even concluded in his review.  This nihilistic attitude does not seem to bring anything more than a parody of itself, as the film unfolds, which gradually increases in meaninglessness.  As mentioned before, the parody, or spoof if you will, seems to evaporate, as Parker and Stone ultimately turn this venture into a cavalcade of shocking scenes for an ever increasingly desensitized audience that will find it funny in the same way a bully muses over his or her victims.  In essence, Team America: World Police begins as a parody that eventually drops the thought it had to embrace and becomes the very same thing that it tries to ridicule.<br /><br />Yet, the film also has a different side where the creators of South Park are able to cause sidesplitting laughter through shocking puppetry with ruthless abandon.  This can only be allowed in a society where freedom allows it.  Many will find this film repulsive while others will deem it generously entertaining.  One great thing comes through this film, which is the exchange of ideas, a dialogue if you will.  In this dialogue people with different convictions first begin to scream, as they try to out scream each other.  Hopefully, both sides realize that screaming does not work, and they lower their voices in order to hear each other out.  Maybe, some are hurt in the process, but so are soldiers in war as some of them fight for the right of the first amendment.  War is not something new and neither is the idea of world peace.  Maybe people need to find some humility through humiliation before people will know that no one is above any idea, and all ideas must be considered for peace to have a chance.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G8IR6ENZSQHF.html">A2G8IR6ENZSQHF</a><br/><p>As a staunch liberal, I was a little nervous about going to see "Team America" when I heard from some critics that it had a right-wing bias (that shocked me when I first heard it, considering the title of the movie).  However, since I loved "South Park", I decided to try and watch the movie with an open mind and, most importantly, try not to take anything seriously.  What I saw was an original, marginally offensive, and occasionally amusing comedy that was unfortunately well below the level of the "South Park" movie.<br /><br />"Team America"'s best laughs come in the first couple minutes, when we see the puppets in action for the first time.  The Middle Eastern stereotypes are hilarious, as is the "patriotic" background music as Team America battles the terrorists.  In fact, the songs throughout the film are good.  There's an absolutely hilarious puppet sex scene, and the Kim Jong puppet is consistently funny (he resembles Cartman).  Most surprisingly, "Team America" works somewhat as a straight-ahead action picture, since it never takes itself seriously and has plenty of puppet-filled action.<br /><br />However, I had qualms with the movie, and mostly with its satire.  The first time the movie made fun of the liberal Hollywood activists, it was funny, but to my disappointment this became a major plot point (by the end, the Hollywood liberals are basically in league with the terrorists).  I consider myself a good sport- I chuckled when puppet Michael Moore decided to suicide-bomb the Team America center- but the idea of Hollywood liberals actively working against the country is a joke that wears thin fast (exempting puppet Matt Damon, who is consistently funny).  Also, the film really bogs down in its final half hour; by that point, the novelty of the puppets had worn off, and more jokes were falling flat (although there is a funny speech at the end).<br /><br />I myself had mixed feelings about "Team America".  It's funny, but not nearly enough.  I'm not sure what the audience for the film could be.  Conservatives will find it too raunchy, liberals will be downright offended, comedy fans may not find it funny enough, and action fans won't like how little it takes itself seriously.  I guess I could recommend it to curious "South Park" fans, but I think overall "Team America" is more deservant of a rental than a movie ticket price.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>Team America - World Police (Uncensored and Unrated Special Collector's Edition)~ Trey Parker is a splendid movie and a brilliant work of satire. It attacks the smug attitude of Hollywood, Broadway, and with songs like "I am so ronery" and the pearl harbor song which totally slammed the movied and the acting ability of Ben Affleck. The movie pulls no punshes and offends both democrats and republicans equally and is quite explicit both in terms of crude language and sexually with the sex scene with the puppets. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are brilliant and this piece of work is right up their with Swift when it comes to biting satire and is one of the best movies in the last decade. I loved it and I will see it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>TEAM AMERICA: WORLD POLICE is a film that'll be enjoyed by those with a penchant for the crude, rude, and socially unacceptable (not surprising since it was made by the creators of SOUTH PARK, Trey Parker and Matt Stone). And although I sometimes enjoy scraping the bottom of the film noir barrel, here the jokes were a bit too crude, rude, and socially unacceptable to be laughable. In fact, I only chuckled a few times.<br /><br />What impressed me about the movie, though, were all of the marionettes (hundreds of them), the elaborate miniature sets, and the `I'm So Lonely' song sung by the Kim Jong Il puppet. You'll note that none of this has to do with the comedic script, too.<br /><br />Making a good comedy-even a cheesy one like this-often requires gag jokes and good dialogue. And although there were tons of gags pulled off in the film (from watching puppets "do it" doggy-style, to having Kim Jong Il act like a gangster rapper), the dialogue was pure rubbish. I realize that it was making fun of action flicks, Americans and American actors' egocentricism, and just about every other world political state out there, but there needs to be some sort of reasoning to these things that gives the film structure. And this movie completely lacked any kind of coherency.<br /><br />The other bad part is that none of the "characters" are memorable. Can anyone tell me the names of the Team America team without watching it again? I can't. And they are what the film is supposed to be about.<br /><br />But, again, if you like watching such things as SOUTH PARK, you'll probably enjoy this movie on the same brain-numbing level.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>I think Trey Parker and Matt Stone out did themselves on this project. I admit they did an awesome job on the whole movie with the choreographed action scenes but what the hell is up with the puppet sex and the 2 minute puking. It was South Park but in puppet version but I didnt like it that much. Though I thought the fact that the bad guy was Kim Jon Il was hilarious and his puppet is awesome and him singing a song was better. The Team America theme song was funny too and also that fact that they made those celebrity puppets and killed them all was a riot as well. Best parts are all with the Kim Jon Il puppet. Very, very offense in everyway and if you can handle that sort of thing it's fine but sensitive people beware, this is not a rejected episode of Thunderbirds its way different. Good luck.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Do you know what I don't understand? Why would Amazon say that it's better together to buy this movie with the incredibles? So that parents who might buy it for the great deal accidentally show their small children that loved the incredibles THIS... I mean why wouldn't Amazon offer to package this with stuff like South Park instead?<br /><br />I had mixed feelings after watching this. For one, it wasn't very funny especially not the stupid song: "America F$#% Yeah!" which wasn't funny at all. Of course, it had some funny humor but if made me feel degraded that Americans need to make stuff like this. It criticizes everything in our nation and basically just wasn't very funny. The hot puppet sex scene was very pointless and stupid and not funny at all. I ended turning it off towards the end because of the amount of profanity used by these puppets. If you like South Park which I don't, I'm sure that you'll love this. But myself, being a huge fan of Family Guy, expected this to be funny, but it just wasn't to me. I found myself just staring at the screen while puppets would run around cussing and shooting terrorists. This trully felt like a wasted amount of time while watching this. But, hey, maybe latter on in life, when I'm older, I might appreciate the jokes better. I trully laughed very rarely and struggled a lot of them, but that's just me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VLX5Z090RQ0V.html">A3VLX5Z090RQ0V</a><br/><p>Wow!  It looks amazing!  I'm certain this is gonna be one the best puppetry films I ever seen since...since...hmm...does anyone know any puppet films that were done here within 10 years?<br /><br />~REVIEW~<br /><br />Originally, this was intended to be a "That's My Bush!" movie (You never heard of "That`s My Bush?"  Only devoted fans have heard of this short-lived sitcom...all 20 of them), but then South Park-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone decided to change its premise entirely and follow the path of Jim Henson.  Thus the two creators produce this off-beat, political action knock-off that is "Team America: World Police."  Whether it was paper animation or live-action, oh hell, Matt and Trey could even make claymation exercise session using a man's unmentionables,  I support and watch whatever wild idea that come out of their demented, creators' flawed minds 100 percent, because I knew it would work to entertain me.  However, in the case of this marionette movie-making experience, this might've change my mind.  This movie didn't entertain me, because it doesn't work.<br /><br />What IS Team America?  It's a "Thunderbirds" rip-off group of young American normies with distinct abilities that goes off against terrorists around the world, while "accidentally" wrecking havoc from the countries by their own actions.  There's Joe, the arrogant action dude with a distaste for actors; Sarah, the  second-only-to-hottest chick with whimsical psychic powers; Chris, the quarterback gun'n jackass; and Lisa, the blonde beauty  on gathering information.  After losing a fellow member in the last battle, the boss of TM recruited an up-and-coming Broadway actor, Gary, to join for the cause.  After much hesitation (and glaring at Lisa more than once), the main character finally agrees to join, and goes on a team mission to find out what the terrorists are planning, and stop them for doing the Big Bang.  Add some hidden love-interests, potty mouths, and a North Korean Dictator as the main villain, this is made for big action storyline goodness...sort of.<br /><br />The story is linear, but I believe that's was intentional by the creators, only the bring in more hysterical chuckles of cruelty (like Matt and Trey has always delivered with their work).  Believe me, this puppet film is more f'd up than that Chinese puppet cinema of gorefest about some warriors finding a sacred stone (Sorry, fanatics, I have not seen "Meet the Feebles").  The writing in "Team America" is so obscene and mature that it has its moment of irksome laughter and upsetting parents.  It's also quite clever, like in the one scene where some celebrities team up to form as an association to stop Team America by the name of "Film Actors' Guild" which can be an acronym as...well, I can't say it here, but it's quirky.<br /><br />This is, by far, one of the best technical-looking puppet films I've seen.  From the well-made human designs to the scenery the movie's lo-cals are, I was impressive by how it looks and how it interacts with things with special effects (explosions, decapitations, etc.)  The beauty of its design, however, comes with a severe flaw to the work in which the creators produced.  Despite its sardonic "no-strings-attached" comedy, the puppets leave A LOT to be desired in the physical humor department.  The best they can do is wobbling around when a battling against enemies like a spastic dancer for CATS, puppet sex (yes, there is a puppet sex scene, and a long one, I say), and vomiting, which was the funniest part in one scene in the film when Gary was drunk and then he threw up...again...again...and AGAIN (Toilet humor, yes, but still effective funny stuff).  Other than those, it wasn't physically over-the-top or breaking new ground compare to Trey and Matt's best work.  And I liked some physical humor.<br /><br />Like South Park: BL&U, "Team America" includes many musical numbers; the pinnacle would be the movie's theme, "America!  **** yea'!"  But unlike that mentioned movie, the songs here aren't completely memorable and they are not going to make me go out and buy the soundtrack.  What bothers me more, comparing to the mentioned movie again, is that "Team America" is so weak to watch.  It's crazy and overkilling on the profanities, and I expected that (maybe too well).  Come on, Trey and Matt, give me something new to laugh at.  Even with the morals and hidden messages the movie subjects, it didn't affect me too much since I wasn't interested.<br /><br />THE FINAL WORD: Boring.  I wanted to give it a good grade, I really do; this is from the creators of my favorite show, darn it!  But watching "Team America", to me, is like watching a wooden copy of Matt and Trey's greatest cinema.  I like the production value, but that's all I can say for positives.  Fans of dark puppetry, or a South park fan with curiosity, should try to catch it and enjoy it by its novel idea.  But for fans looking a different taste of gag from what they already saw, watching this dummy movie can make you look like the dummy.</p></br><a href="../users/AXOS8IWBXNZGT.html">AXOS8IWBXNZGT</a><br/><p>I was lent a copy of Team America: World Police for the weekend, and just finished watching it. It's a marionette movie, which I've never seen before, and it's from the occasionally funny creators of South Park.<br /><br />Move premise: Team America is a not-so-super-secret team of do-gooders, acting to thwart terrorism around the globe. In the opening sequence, a member of the team is killed in an operation in Paris, and a new member is recruited, an actor in a popular Broadway show. The terrorists' plans are still in play, and the team must defeat the terrorists, and their evil mastermind, and save the world.<br /><br />At heart, this movie is supposed to be a satire. The movie's creators do delight in skewering everyone and everything in sight: the left and right wings, American blindness to how their actions are viewed by those abroad, and several well-known film actors. The efforts do fall short of satire, however; satire should carry that feeling of...subversiveness, and instead you just get the sense that the characters are blundering through life, Clouseau-fashion.<br /><br />The movie is funny at times, though be forewarned as the humour is crude and bawdy and did I mention crude? Puppet sex had me laughing out loud! Don't be showing this movie to kids; there's a reason it's rated "R". There's no true intellectual humour here, as one would hope with a satire (and one would get with a satire such as Dr. Strangelove).<br /><br />I should mention that the opening sequence rubbed me the wrong way a little bit, especially after having read Is Paris Burning? recently. The City of Lights deserves to be treated with more care, and certainly should be portrayed more accurately.<br /><br />This would be one of those "see on an airplane" movies, but the odds of this happening are pretty much nil.</p></br><a href="../users/A16IXZW2A0NFR6.html">A16IXZW2A0NFR6</a><br/><p>I'm not offended by this movie in fact I really liked the South Park Movie but this movie was just dumb. Just because it has puppets shooting each other and having sex I guess it's supposed to be funny, not really. This one just really felt like a waste of time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>I am not much of a fan of South Park (though I liked the film), but I decided to watch this anyway, and it's a really creepy, bad movie.  I really don't know why they decided to use hand puppets for the characters.  Their faces are expressionless for the most part, and it gives off a really creepy vibe, which I don't think was the intention.  The film is a bit dated already, as many targets of its satire are not newsmakers anymore.  Many in the future will watch this film in utter bewilderment, as they will not have the context to understand it, because all of its satire is topical.  Of course, there are gross out jokes (it wouldn't be a Trey and Matt if there wasn't).  I did like some of the satire.  There's a very funny moment at a meeting of "FAG" (really childish name) where the Janeane Garofalo hand puppet says "we should be allowed to read news headlines and pretend they're our own words".  Janeane recently appeared on Bill Maher's show, and she said "Bush is the new Saddam".  This was an actual headline from a Canadian newspaper recently, so I thought the sequence was rather amusing.  In fairness to Janeane, she doesn't do this all the time, but it's still worth noting.  But too often these incisive satiric moments like that are few and far between, and the film relies on gross out humour, bad jokes, monotonic dialogue, and just lazy writing.  The South Park movie was funnier and more interesting.</p></br><a href="../users/A5KJVGJ43ZDC9.html">A5KJVGJ43ZDC9</a><br/><p>...is what I say.Would he find yet one more reason to eschew Westernization? Would he even understand the type of brain damage it takes to make something like this? Team America is a failure, more or less, but how do you top the South Park movie in terms of grossing out, offending your audience and having time to satirize everything under the sun in between? Simple. You have marionettes...wait,I don't think I can get away with mentioning what Parker and Stone do with them here. You just won't believe it.

I'm beginning to think with all the earthquakes in California maybe the best thing is to have a huge one where the entire State of California will just fall into the ocean.  Then and maybe then will someone of talent make movies that are enjoyable to everyone.  Right now there is no more talent in Hollywood, nither actors, producers or directors.  This film made me feel embarrased that the rest of the world sees what little talent we have in america.</p></br><a href="../users/A16FUU8WW76QFY.html">A16FUU8WW76QFY</a><br/><p>Hey, what else can I say?  That's my opinion.  Maybe I'm just too old (47) to get the juvenile, excretory "humor" of this film, but I just thought it wasn't very intelligent.  Lots of stereotypes, bad songs, grossouts, and cursing (mf, f, etc.) make "Team America" an exercise in bad taste.<br /><br />It looked like a propaganda film from the Bush administration.  American actors (F.A.G.) are made to look like collaborators with Kim Jong-Il, the very strange "Dear Leader" of North Korea.  Americans who wish blow the hell out of everything are the heroes of this movie.  Thing is, I wouldn't have really cared which side the heroes or bad guys were on if this movie was really funny-which it is not.  The "gags" are gross and disgusting, and not worth laughing at.<br /><br />This was one of those "not finished" DVDs, I'm sorry to say.  When the dude puked up a Lake Michigan-sized puddle of you-know-what, that was pretty much it.</p></br><a href="../users/AS558SNWF1DXG.html">AS558SNWF1DXG</a><br/><p>...involving all the vomit. The sex scene got all the attention from critics and pundits but for my money, the extended regurgitation scene took the prize.  I realize some people probably found it disgusting but they were probably watching the wrong movie.<br /><br />And maybe I'm just jaded but I actually didn't think it was as raunchy as it's rep proclaimed.  There's actually kind of a sweet undercurrent to the whole thing, despite the fact that it's basically making fun of the left, right and everyone in between.<br /><br />Another highlight: Kim Jong Il's musical number.  In fact, all the songs were dead-on parodies.  You really have to pay attention to pop country anthems to nail them the way Parker and Stone did.<br /><br />The extra features on the disc are pretty good, too.  I never thought watching puppeteers could be so interesting.</p></br><a href="../users/A12IDQSS4OW33B.html">A12IDQSS4OW33B</a><br/><p>3 and a half stars for me, please. There is no real reason for this to be uncensored, but it just did not turn out to be as funny as I hoped. Don't get me wrong...it's still entertaining. This is how things are when you mix terrorism with celebrities and Kim Jong Il with marionettes. That's it. All I can really say is that I'm at a total loss to describe this movie. I can relate most to Kim Jong Il's feelings............<br /><br />"MATT DAMON!!"</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Matt Stone and Trey Parker are among some of the most clever and most savage satirists working today. Every week on their crudely animated TV show, South Park, they skewer sacred cows like religion, politics and dominant figures in popular culture. Their feature film debut, South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut, was a brilliant attack on rampant nationalism and the hypocrisy of the MPAA movie censors. Stone and Parker are back with another ingenious effort, Team America World Police, an action film done with puppets in the tradition of the classic Thunderbirds TV show.<br /><br />Like any good satire, Stone and Parker play it completely straight, never winking at the audience. Satire that works is almost always misinterpreted and rarely appreciated when it first comes out. Case in point: the South Park movie which wasn't the mega-blockbuster that the studio had hoped but has since developed a loyal cult following. I can see Team America heading the same way. One of the things that makes this movie so funny is that it goes after targets so in need of being satirized.<br /><br />The Unrated Version of this movie features a slightly longer, more disturbingly explicit puppet sex scene, which, not surprisingly, did not pass the MPAA censors.<br /><br />"Team America: An Introduction" has Parker and Stone introduce the members of the team. They mention that this movie was a conscious decision to take a giant step back, technology-wise, and a response to the excessive use of CGI in contemporary action movies.<br /><br />"Building the World" takes a look at the ambitious sets built for this movie. Production designer Jim Dultz had to recreate a believable Bruckheimer-esque world. The scale is truly impressive as is the amount of detail.<br /><br />"Crafting the Puppets" features puppet producer Edward Chiodo who talks about how he helped realize Matt and Trey's vision. We are taken through the design process (size, sculpting, etc.), how they are put together and so on.<br /><br />"Pulling the Strings" is a brief look at the art of puppeteering and how the film's puppeteers tried to achieve everything Matt and Trey wanted, including large scale action sequences with many puppets on camera at once.<br /><br />"Capturing the Action" takes a look at the film's director of photography, Bill Pope (who worked on The Matrix movies). He talks about applying normal action film camera moves to this movie and how he had to adjust said techniques for a smaller scale.<br /><br />"Miniature Pyrotechnics" shows how they pulled off some of the great looking explosions in camera and with no CGI.<br /><br />"Up Close with Kim Jong-Il" features Matt and Trey talking about why they cast the notorious North Korean dictator as the film's villain. In their research, they found out that he is huge film buff and hope that he gets to see this movie.<br /><br />Also included are "Dressing Room" and "Puppet" tests that are essentially demo reels trying out certain moves and actions with the puppets.<br /><br />There are ten "Deleted/Extended Scenes and Outtakes" totaling six minutes. One of the highlights is a funny bit with Team America's commander talking about his hatred of Winnie the Pooh that should not have been cut.<br /><br />"Animated Storyboards" showcase the drawings created to plot out and frame six scenes from the movie.<br /><br />Finally, there are two theatrical trailers.</p></br><a href="../users/A37ZOGOK3GKF2P.html">A37ZOGOK3GKF2P</a><br/><p>No one was spared in this dark satire of just about everything.  I thought I was going to burst with laughter.  At one point I wet my pants, ruptured my spleen I was laughing so hard.  Trey and Matt may very well be the next Mel Brooks, OK the next John Waters is more like it.  This is a sick, twisted, and deviant ride into hillarity.  It reminds me what the "Thunderbirds" would have been like if everyone had been really drunk and said what ever was on their minds at the time.  Celebrities, political leaders, religious leaders, americans, the military, cats, dogs, everyone gets it, NO ONE IS SPARED.  I can only imagine what an unrated director's cut would be like.  (HINT, HINT).  If you don't like vulgar or sick humor then stay away.  If you are a fan of "Orgazmo," or "South Park," sit down, relax and enjoy the show.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N49TOJZFG48H.html">A1N49TOJZFG48H</a><br/><p>leave it to MATT and TREY to rip virtually everything the united states does and stands for a new one . the soundtrack alone is priceless . ripping off the lame THUNDERBIRDS as a launching point for humor and commentary was inspired . while difficult to watch in a mostly empty movie theater , once at home you're free to laugh with abandon while watching one of the funniest films ever concieved . seeing MOORE blow himself up is worth the price of admission alone . genius . flawless . thanks guys .</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>After seeing this, you may be somewhat surprised that creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone were able to avoid getting the Salman Rushdie treatment from the forces of international jihad in response to their 90 minutes addressing Islamofacism. The whole thing is a puppetpalooza as the entire film is composed of puppets who are able to do everything that real people do including projectile puking. There's not much of a superficial South Park feel to this film as the plot more closely resembles the old Maxwell Smart vehicle, "The Nude Bomb" than anything offered weekly on Comedy Central.  The Mission Impossible backdrop goes so far as to even have a even a master computer named "I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E." and a Mount Rushmore command center for Team America.<br /><br />Yet, the satire will be quite familiar to those who watch South Park and more amazing than anything one can readily imagine.  The war on terror is a great vehicle for these guys to make fun of just about every one on the planet (humanity can be broken down into the simple framework of a--holes, p-ssies, and dicks here).  There are silly songs and killer lines throughout.  Their send up of the play "Rent" is one early example.  Now it's entitled "Lease" and the theme song is "Everyone has AIDS".  We hear such lines as "come on everybody we've got quilting to do." More jingles like, "America: F--- Yeah!", round out the film and it becomes the Team America theme song.<br /><br />Obviously, any story these guys tell is just a surface mechanism for them to ostentatiously display their unworldly wit which is just fine with me. The gratuitious romantic plotline is present; although, the resultant puppet sex is something beyond description and is more like something from a German scat trailer than anything you'd see from Sandra Bullock or Keanu Reeves.<br /><br />Overall, I found Team America/World Police to be masterful. The Screen Actors' Guild is now called the Film Actors Guild which lends itself to the uproarious acronyn of F.A.G.  It is led by the king poseur himself, Alec Baldwin (who, by all rights, should be a Canadain citizen by now).  Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, and Jeanne Garafalo also figure in heavily.  They are all self-righteously opposed to Team America and become the unwitting dupes of the terrorists and the totalitarian dictator of North Korea...much as they have in real life.  F.A.G. is quite similar to the Hollywood organization, "Not in Our Name."  Parody becomes dangerously close to reality in this film.<br /><br />My favorite part was the skewering of the fat b-stard, Michael "Giant Socialist Weasel" Moore.  He turns into a suicide bomber which is something that many of his ideological opponents would have wished upon him years ago.<br /><br />The portrayal of Kim Jong-il is nearly equal to that of Parker and Stone's 1999 efforts with Saddam Hussein. He's a singing, screaming, plotting dictator right out of Austin Powers.  It's great fun and might be the only punch that the world ever lands upon the North Korean menace.  I'm grateful to the makers of Team America and hope that they create a follow up at least half as politically damaging as this one was.</p></br><a href="../users/A356TJCTCLDN89.html">A356TJCTCLDN89</a><br/><p>I really, really, really liked Team America. Yeah, it's rude, vulgar, uses the F word as both a noun and a verb and it has a sex scene that made me cringe and change the channel for a few mintues but it's also funny. The  songs, especially Montage, America .. Yeah, and I'm So Ronery were brilliant. The mockery of our smug, self important little celebrites  and political correctness was great and the scene where the team destroys half of Egypt, with the best of intentions was a gut buster.<br /><br />So it's not up there with "On the Waterfront" but neither is anything else in the theaters today. Team America may be mindless but it sure is fun. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go sing America... Yeah for the 50th time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X15AQVSCKKRG.html">A1X15AQVSCKKRG</a><br/><p>Wow, This is a hilarious movie, probably one of the funniest<br />American movies I have ever seen. Bringing in the use of puppets as used by other series like "The Thunderbirds" , Matt Stone<br />and Trey Parker have hit gold with this movie. Wow where do I start.<br /><br />Originally Trey Park and Matt Stone were set to direct a spoof<br />of "The Day After Tommorow" but that plan was soon removed.<br /><br />They then decided to make "Team America World Police" released<br />by Paramount.<br /><br />This is a movie that is undergoing such buzz in Hollywood and has gotten worldwide attention among movie fans, clearly this is a movie that is unique.<br /><br />Matt Stone and Trey Parker have done what other directors have failed to do in the last few years, used a funny movie to create great satire centering on todays corrupt politics, and worldview ,not to mention our  over emphasis fear on "Terrorism" and American ideals.<br /><br />The movie main plot is that a group of Americans are part of a secret police that well polices the world under the name "Team America" lol Well they hunt down terrorist like Osama Bin<br />Laden and others while acting as diplomatically incorrect as possible.<br /><br />The scene which spoofs Hans Blitzer a weapons inspector against Korean Dictaor Mr. Cho is hilarious. While Matt and Trey obviously are not trying to make a political movie,<br />they obviously gives us their interpretation of what not only goes on in the mind of a terrorist, but the corrupt and often  nonexistent plans that the US has in getting these terrorist.<br /><br />Speaking of which the first frame of the movie is pure comedy as the Team America within a span of five minutes are able to track down Osama Bin Laden, something the poor and disorganized Administration of George Bush and the military has failed to do since September 11<br /><br />Of course theirs spoofs of movies like the Matrix with the Team America often battling with hilarous, over the top martial arts kicks and punches, but its all done with such lack of precision that you cant help but die laughing at the screen.<br /><br />The movie while undergoing tremendous success at the box office and praise from fans, has gotten many cheapshots from many so called professional critics who are anything but professional.<br /><br />Roger Ebert said the movie was nihilistic , lame and that Trey and  Matt'ss attempt was to make fun of "anyone who cares about the war" like Sean Penn.<br /><br />Yet Ebert doesnt mention that spoiled celebrities like Sean Penn and Alec  Baldwin  who say they "care" about the war have an agenda and are using the war to clean their image.<br /><br />Richard Roper on the other hand, gave a great review, calling it a  great piece of satire and that he enjoyed the jokes.<br /><br />However, Trey and Matt also give a nice ode to the troops<br />in America by the song delivered "Freedom isn't Free".<br />Freedom is not free many Americans died for our Freedom<br />and we should never forget that, if it wasn't for the sacrifices<br />of others, we wouldn't have the world we have today.<br /><br />Overall though , "Team America World Police" from the creators of South Park is absolutely  funny that has to be seen over and over again.<br /><br />I can see a couple of months down the line that DVD release of this movie like Fahrenheit 911 is sure to be a huge hit, so see this funny movie now.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>I had to see this movie in L.A.  I had to see how a politically-correct crowd of west coasters would react to the onslaught of crude humor in TEAM AMERICA.  There were gasps, but there were a lot of laughs (I saw it in Santa Monica).  The house wasn't full, but I realized that this movie will probably do better when it hits DVD and the stigma of being seen going to it won't be as bad.<br /><br />Kind of like porn.<br /><br />Like some of their best stuff, the creators of TEAM AMERICA are very hit and miss.  But when they hit, it's into the stratosphere.<br /><br />Rarely have I seen a movie that manages to make fun of so many things to so many people.  There's bound to be at least one thing that will offend anyone reading this, but you'll probably have a couple really hard laughs at other scenes.<br /><br />They've taken the ridiculous medium of puppetry (remember the THUNDERBIRDS from childhood?) to play out a brainless Hollywood action film, but they've also satirized the brainless Hollywood A-list of celebrity/activists (including "the greatest living actor of all-time, Alec Baldwin").  The constant barrage of bad language detracted from the overall film--but these are the mind behind "South Park," so there you go.<br /><br />I have a feeling the film will be more successful as a DVD: everyone's curious to see what was left out the first time around--especially of that notorious puppet sex scene!</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>My kids were just at the wrong age, too young, for me to have gotten into South Park, so "Team America" was kind of a revelation to me. The movie is vulgar, politically incorrect and oh so crude. But it is also a very smart combination of writing, smart puppeteering and topical satire that is just has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />Team America is a group of star-spangled fighters who take on terrorists. They tend to be a little quick on the draw, and often cause more damage to those they want to save than the bad guys. The opening scene, in which the team blows the living hell out of Central Paris, sets the stage for the rest of the film.<br /><br />It's hard sometimes to know with Trey and Stone where satire ends and crude ethnic stereotyping begins. One American character bluffs his way past a couple of Arab guards by repeating variations on "Durka durka." Is this making fun of the America belief that foreign culture and language is so easily adopted?  Or that Arabic is barbaric nonsense? Hard to say. Then there is the film's portrayal of many of Hollywood's leftist artists as terror-pandering loons. Alec Baldwin comes in for a particular savaging, but then so do Susan Sarandon, Janeane Garafalo, Matt Damon and many others. Trey and Stone are notoriously evenhanded in targeting left and right, though I have to say that the right gets off rather easy in this film. It's a choice being portrayed as narrow-mindedly militaristic v getting your head blown off.<br /><br />Anyway, Team America finds its way to North Korea, where lead bad guy, Kim Jong Ill, is the terrorist puppet master who pulls the metaphorical strings of terrorists around the globe. Sometimes I wonder whether the real Kim, already on the downslope of the sanity slide, would see this movie by itself as a pretext to harry the West. Let's hope that never happens. In the film, he is a sadistic crime master with a "ronery" (lonely) heart of gold. His signature song, "I'm so Ronery" bewails his lack of company at the top, while making uncomfortable fun of the East Asian pronunciation. It's this kind of combination hi- and low-brow humor that make the film irresistible and enchanting for nearly every taste..<br /><br />For a kid like me who grew up in the 60's with shows like "Fireball XL-5" that feature the hop-skip motion of puppets, this film was a great nostalgia trip. Even a 6-year old kid in 1962 watching characters flop into their jet pilot's seats knew he was watching something bizarre and memorable. "Team America" ramps up the inanity of the puppeteering technique, inserting all manner of violence and sexuality that the producers of "Fireball" could never have imagined. Trey and Stone pay tribute to the genre while mercilessly exploiting and expanding it. The film's music adds greatly to the sense of irreverent fun. A love song between two characters ("Pearl Harbor sucked, and I love you") trashes Ben Affleck and takes a swipe at smarmy movie love songs.  The film's theme song is not only rude, violent and jingoistic, but has a country flavor that fits right into the "I'm proud to be an American" genre of contemporary popular patriotic music.<br /><br />Team America is not a film for the gentle or pious. Church folk - stay away! But if you have a certain kind of twisted humor, can stand watching puppets blowing each other away with automatic weapons and explosives, and don't mind watching naked, articulated puppets engage in every graphic sexual situation imaginable, then put this film on your cinematic bucket list.<br /><br />Should you pick up or watch "Team America"? F-yeah!</p></br><a href="../users/ABP69F7LFTI1R.html">ABP69F7LFTI1R</a><br/><p>I found the puppets in this movie more life-like and interesting than the multi-million dollar puppets and CGI used in big blockbuster movies.  This movie isn't for children, but Trey and Matt are so childlike (not childish) in presenting the issues it really wasen't offensive at all. I found it sharp, witty, well detailed (loved the lit cigarette the puppet was holding), very original story, and pants wetting funny! Even the songs the characters sang were well written and to the point.  Keep up the good work, guys, a lot of your fans really appreciate it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>I was slightly disappointed the first time I saw this film - probably because I was so hyped up about it, having heard so many people talk about how hilarious it was.  My second time through it, though, everything clicked.  Team America: World Police is juvenile and disgusting, yet sharply pointed satire that goes out of its way to be offensive - in other words, it's hilarious, and yet more proof of Trey Parker's genius.  Parker and Stone do things no one else would ever dream of doing - or even be allowed to do.  It's a film I know I know I will enjoy watching time and time again for years to come.<br /><br />Hilarity aside, the audacity of making such an elaborate film using puppets is almost mind-boggling.  Parker and Stone probably had little idea of what they were getting into, yet they stayed the course, brought together a tremendous team of individuals who, as the special features make obvious, relished the chance to take the art of puppetry to new heights, and created something that is really quite amazing.  It's uncanny how life-like these puppets are - I daresay Alec Baldwin, for example, is much more wooden in real life than is his puppet in this film.  These aren't just wooden characters dangling on strings; each puppet's head is filled with animatronics that control his/her expressions with uncanny precision.  The puppet fights are hilarious, but nothing's funnier than watching Gary give "the signal" as his first mission with the elite American fighting force goes south.<br /><br />As with everything Parker and Stone do, there's actually a point behind all of the humor.  Though their detractors would never admit it, these guys actually do have a handle on what is going on in the world - and within America.  If you've ever seen South Park, you know how quickly they manage to exploit the big issues of the day.  No one is safe from these guys' political humor, but the Left does tend to suffer the brunt of the satirical attack in this film.  (Those who say Parker and Stone are suddenly outright conservatives have obviously forgotten their short-lived series That's My Bush - which was the only unfunny thing they've ever done.)  Team America itself takes America's military might to obvious extremes, as when they pretty much destroy Paris in order to stop WMD-toting terrorists (of course, no one seems to consider the fact that the terrorists would have destroyed Paris to an even greater extent themselves had their plan succeeded).  Alec Baldwin's ilk, though, suffers most because they have two Stone/Parker targets on their back.  One, they are soporific liberals who would stop terrorism by sympathizing with the enemy and commiserating with their extreme anti-American views over tea and crumpets; two, they are actors and I think Parker and Stone really mean it when they say they hate actors - it's one of the reasons they chose to make this movie with puppets (plus, one of the original inspirations for the project was the idea of doing a parody of today's action films).<br /><br />I don't think I need to describe the movie, really.  Kim Jong-Il (even though he does sound a little too much like Eric Cartman, at times) is a great character, of course, but you probably know all about the film's story by now.  It is true that Parker and Stone push the envelope (actually, they just tear it all apart and rush right on past it) at times - especially in the puppet love scene and the vomiting scene - probably just to prove how much they can get away with, but you just have to expect that sort of thing from these guys.  It's one of the things that makes them Parker and Stone.  Let's not forget the songs, either.  From the heart-pumping theme song to Kim Jung-Il's loneliness lament, Team America World Police features a great soundtrack (be sure to go all the way through the final credits in order to hear a final little snippet from Kim Jung-Il).<br /><br />If you're easily offended, you'll probably be holding your nose higher and higher as you watch this film (even while those around you are bent over holding their stomachs with laughter) - but that's okay because the rest of us need someone to hold our popcorn while we struggle to regain our breath.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JYIDH7JIG48H.html">A2JYIDH7JIG48H</a><br/><p>Team America is one of the funniest movies I've seen in this millenium; it is also one of the most disgusting.  To give you an idea of the type of humor, it's fair to compare it to Mike Myer's Austin Powers movies.  If you liked Austin Powers, you'll probably like Team America, but it's not for kids or seniors - or normal people.  It has about an order of magnitude more filthy language and sexual humor, not just inuendo.  Yes, much of the humor is sophomoric (perverse and repulsive), but there is also much very funny satire, and the whole thing is ridiculous because they're just puppets, and that made me and the whole audience laugh as much as anything.  Much has been written about the film being homophobic; that's just nonsense, propaganda put out by Hollywood types who are offended by the very funny satire poking fun (violently) at the puppet versions of their friends Alec Baldwin, Susan Sarandon, Matt Damon and others.  The movie also lampoons right-wing secret government agencies, and the whole homophobic thing is about homosexual acts of the head of the agency - to me it seemed pro-gay.  At any rate, the movie's offensive to everyone, and if you can stomach it, it's a riot.</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>I got some advance tickets to see this film and I threw them away.  I thought it looked really dumb and decided not to see it.  A friend of mine (through a lot of convincing) got me to see the film and I'm glad I did.  Crude humor, politically incorrect and puppet sex----what more could you ask for!  The film is send up of all those patriotic action films with tired formulas and horrible dialogue.  But the writers also skewer pretty much everyone else---actors, dictators and more.  If you are looking for a lot of laughs from a very guilty pleasure, this film is for you!  Not for everyone but recommended!!!</p></br></body></html>

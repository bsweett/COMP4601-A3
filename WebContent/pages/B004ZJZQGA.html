Though the basic storyline is rather simple, McDonagh knows how to keep it turning and twisting with generous amounts of humor as well as probing character development.  He has assembled a cast of very fine actors, turned the cinematography of the gorgeous Belgian city of Bruges over to the capable creative hands of Eigil Bryld, and finished his project off with a fine musical score by the gifted Carter Burwell (with a nod to Schubert and others): the result is a beautiful little film with messages galore and always a visual treat to see repeatedly.<br /><br />Two hit men - Ken (Brendan Gleeson), a chubby, optimistic bloke who loves spending time with the sights of Bruges, and Ray (Colin Farrell), an emotionally distraught young man in the throes of guilt from a botched 'hit' that accidentally killed a young boy - have been sent by their 'boss' Harry (Ralph Fiennes) to 'lay low' after the botched murder  of a priest (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds).  It is Christmas season and there are too few rooms available so Ken and Ray reluctantly share a tiny hotel room to await further orders from Harry. Ken falls in love with the beauty of the city of Bruges while Ray, ever anxious and distrustful, finds some solace in a film being shot about 'midgets' (J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Renie) with behind the scenes girl Chlo? (Cl&eacute;mence Po&eacute;sy). How these two Irish guys make the most of their enforced isolation ultimately leads to  the real reason for their assignment, a reason that includes a last 'hit' that sweeps the audience to a surprising ending.<br /><br />McDonagh writes very well, giving some of the best comedic lines to Farrell who proves himself a fine fit for this difficult role.  Yes, it is another 'hit man film', but this one has the good fortune to deal with very real people, conflicted with their choice of 'occupation' and who are hungry to share their tenuous lives with good friends.  Though there is considerable bloody derring-do, the film uses the chase and kill scenes to good advantage, allowing the audience to feel the human side of those whose job it is to 'off' others.  Both Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are superb and their roles are enhanced by a choice selection of character actors who speed the plot along nicely.  This is a very entertaining movie, one that can be appreciated on many levels, and one that suggests that Martin McDonagh has a solid future in cinema. Grady Harp, June 08</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>I've seen a lot of hit man movies but none quite like "In Bruges", which combines black comedy and high drama to surprisingly fresh effect. Not only is it genuinely funny, but it's original. I haven't seen these characters countless times before. Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray (Colin Farrell) are a couple of Irish hit men sent to Bruges, Brussels to lie low after Ray accidentally killed a child on a job in London. Ken is able to relax and enjoy the sightseeing in the picturesque city while they await instructions from their boss Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes). But Ray is nervous, disinterested, and guilt-ridden -until he meets Chloe (Clemence Poesy), a woman working on a Belgian film crew who isn't put off by Ray's obnoxious behavior.<br /><br />Martin McDonagh wrote and directed "In Bruges", his first feature film, and I'll be looking out for him in the future. He writes peculiar, politically incorrect dialogue that is both hilarious and unexpected. And I was amazed by this film's ability to make unrespectable characters so likable. Ray is an uneducated bigot, cute, but nevertheless grating. Yet his interplay with the older and wiser Ken is fascinating and leaves the audience routing for him. Harry Waters is single-minded killer, but he is so steadfast in his own bizarre value system that he's almost sympathetic. These men's rather serious problems ultimately had me laughing out loud. Ironically, I found the violence had more impact than in most gangster films, though I'm not sure if that is due to, or in spite of, the humor.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2008): Bonus features include some Deleted & Extended scenes, a Gag Reel (6 min), and 4 featurettes. "When in Bruges" (14 min) interviews writer/director Martin McDonagh, the cast, and producer Graham Broadbent about the genesis of the story, characters, and themes. "Strange Bruges" (7 ? min) talks with director, cast, and production designer Michael Carlin about the city as environment and filming there. "A Boat Trip Around Bruges" (6 min) is literally a boat tour of the city, by canal, with the history of the city displaying as text across the top and bottom of the screen. "Fooking Bruges" (1 ? min) is a montage of all the F-words in the movie, which I count to be over 100. Subtitles are available in English SDH, Spanish, French. Dubbing available in French.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Warning: this film may not be for you.  The two leading characters are Irish hit men, and their language would shock those shocked by coarse language.  There are also essentially no "good guys."  In addition to murderers, the film is populated by prostitutes and drug dealers.<br /><br />But since violent and profane films have become prevalent, I think that they are worth your time, like any film, if they are good.  This one is good.<br /><br />We were invited to a friend's for movie night and the Mrs. didn't care for it.  We didn't know what film had been chosen and I think she felt a little blind-sided.  As the opening credits showed the writer and director was Martin McDonagh, I was a little prepared for the desperately comic violence that followed.  Mr. McDonagh, you see, is the Irish playwright who gave us "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1408111071">The Lieutenant of Inishmore (Student Editions)</a>", a play in which much murder and mayhem follows the death of a cat belonging to a dim, but fearful, Irish terrorist.<br /><br />Colin Farrell plays Ray and Brendan Gleeson plays Ken.  Ray and Ken have been sent to Bruges to hide out after the botched murder of a priest.  Ken has been a hit man for years and accepts the baggage that comes with the job.  He finds Bruges delightful and at one level the film plays as a magnificent travelogue for the town.  In the film it seems as picturesque as Amsterdam or Venice, but with less tourists.  Ray is a new hit man, and the botched hit was his fault, and his first job.  We can't tell if Ray is jumpy only because of guilt over the bad priest job (as Farrell implies with his acting), or if (as he says) he truly doesn't like Bruges.  Ray didn't know much about Bruges before being sent there, Farrell tells us in an f-bomb-laced opening narration.  He concludes "It's in Belgium."<br /><br />While Ken is delightfully taking in the centuries-old architecture, Ray comes along to brood and complain until they come upon a movie in production.  Ray is entranced by Chloe, played by Clemence Poesy, a woman working at the edges of the film crew, and he doesn't quite know what to make of American dwarf Jimmy, played by Jordan Prentice.  Ray keeps calling Jimmy a midget, and he harbors a grudge against Americans for killing John Lennon.<br /><br />Ray and Ken work for Harry, who ominously orders them to Bruges in Ray's opening monologue.  We know Harry is a darker, more sinister character than our protagonists before he phones Ken with an assignment that gives the usually agreeable Ken grave reservations.  McDonagh gradually shows us Harry - played by Ralph Fiennes with full profane fury.<br /><br />McDonagh's screenplay peppers the proceedings with comic dialogue on subjects such as the morality of being an assassin, ("I have to reconcile that with the fact that yes, I have killed people. Not many people. And most of them were not very nice people. Apart from one person."), diverse views on the pleasures of Bruges ("Ken, I grew up in Dublin. I love Dublin. If I grew up on a farm, and was retarded, Bruges might impress me but I didn't, so it doesn't.") and choice of weapon for assassination ("An Uzi? I'm not from South Central Los Angeles. I didn't come here to shoot twenty black ten year olds in a drive-by. I want a normal gun for a normal person.")<br /><br />In Bruges is the kind of film where a character can be sent to murder another character and find THAT character about to commit suicide - then finish the scene with the assassin instead sending the other character away on a train.  But it is also the kind of film where deadly violence erupts repeatedly, sometimes with ironic and often with comic overtones.<br /><br />So - if you're in the market for a black comedy about Irish assassins, "In Bruges" fits the bill.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>'In Bruges' will not appeal to everyone, but it is brilliant at times. I found the film uneven, laughing hysterically one moment and bored to tears the next. This could have been due to the thick accent by the lead characters in the film being hard to understand sometimes. It's smart, funny and gruesome, but it's too long and has some very unnecessary scenes that took it down a few pegs in my book. If you liked this film you may like 'You Kill Me' which I thought was a better film than this.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>I liked "In Bruges" a lot, though I question it's Golden Globe status as a comedy. I can't argue Mr. Farrell's win as Best Actor. It's a buddy movie, and I was remotely reminded of "Pulp Fiction", where the language was second nature. Certainly, there's a lot of mindless profanity, but a clever DVD extra shows just how silly it all is. The camaraderie between Farrell and Brendan Gleeson is well established; the ARE an odd couple, but there's a fondness that develops that is special. This is largely the achievement of writer-director Martin McDonagh, keeping creepiness, sad memories, and an unusual sense of humor that prevails throughout. Then there's the later appearance of Ralph Fiennes, the most clueless of mean persons. Without blabbing anything away, they all create an enigmatic trio. I enjoyed Jordan Prentice a lot, a confident actor with some delightfully bitter dialogue; I recall that Peter Dinklage (The Station Agent) was as bitter and suspicious.  Certainly, the little people have been given few chances to shine. He was a real character, and delightful. The only Oscar nomination is for Screenplay, and if you can see beyond the profanity, it's insightful, clever and touching. Indeed, Colin Farrell's best performance. I enjoyed it a lot. And Bruges is, indeed, a character unto itself. Stunning photography as required; another fine DVD extra is a boat trip through the canals. Quite instructive.</p></br><a href="../users/AHBNPMHDWZ7SB.html">AHBNPMHDWZ7SB</a><br/><p>Quite frankly, In Bruges is a well done film. It took me a little while to process it, but it really does leave an impact. I had to rewatch it a couple of times as well, just to fully grasp it and appreciate its subtlety. The acting is phenominal. Colin Farrell was surprisingly great. He has never made me laugh much at all, but he was pretty funny in this film. Brendan Gleeson was phenominal as always. He may just be my favorite actor that isn't a household name. A few years ago, prior to seeing this and then going on to recognizing him in many more films afterwards, I only knew him as that weird professor from The Order of the Phoenix. But he has certainly moved up my list with each subsequent film I see him in. Ralph Fiennes had a fairly short amount of screen time, but he made the most of it. Very menacing, and dare I say ordinary villain. Not to mention, he delivered the film's absolute best line. Without going into detail, it's about inanimate objects.<br /><br />The performances absolutely make this movie, but there are many other good feats to mention. The script was very well written. It's not exactly a laugh out loud comedy, but there are some tongue in cheek moments that made me pause, smile, then after processing what I had heard, or seen, bust out with laughter. This is dark comedy at its best. It really is funny. That doesn't take away from the dramatic elements at all though. It does get very dramatic. The worst part is that you don't even expect to get hit with an emotional scene directly after a funny one. It's a great combination. I did like it a lot, but it's not something I'd recommend for everyone. I'm not sure if I'd call it polarizing, but it's the definition of "see it for yourself, and you be the judge." Obviously, there are better dark comedies out there. This movie actually has a bit of a Coen Brother feel to it, which is always a major compliment, at least to me. In fact, quite a few of their films are the better dark comedies I was referring to.<br /><br />I had a little trouble getting past some of the music choices. I think the composer and music supervisor could have done better jobs. That said, I got past the music pretty quickly once the characters and story itself sucked me in. I also think there are definitely questionable moments. Therefore, a little suspension of disbelief is required. In other words, you can't be one of those nitpicking people who know how to ruin the experience and immersion. Despite my complaints, the good very much outweighs the bad. There are plenty of redeeming qualities. I think this is still a movie that everyone should see. It's well worth the time, and money (if you have to spend it). I highly recommend In Bruges.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>Billed as a black comedy, this story of two stir-crazy Irish hitmen on the lam in Belgium could just as easily fall into any one of a dozen other genres. With traces of humor, suspense, romance, action and drama all stirred into the same bubbling pot, the risk is certainly there for overexertion, but the finished product doesn't fall short in any instance. The comedy is sharply witty and well-timed, the action fast-paced and fiery, the romance heartfelt but not heavy. Colin Farrell, whose eyebrows migrate around his forehead like a pair of pitch black caterpillars on acid, works a good range of emotions out of his fairly simple leading role and cleanly manages to get us rooting for him by the time the closing scenes roll around. Upon reflection, there really isn't all that much to the story - it's predictable at worst, minimal at best - but there doesn't need to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>Writer/director Martin McDonagh takes some time setting the scene and developing his characters, before he reveals that his film In Bruges (2008) is not about an offbeat vacation trip, but is actually a grim crime thriller, with a wicked sense of humor.  Spoilers follow.<br /><br />Englishmen Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray (Colin Farrell) arrive in Burges, Belgium, check into a hotel, and begin seeing the many sights in the historic city.  A movie is being filmed in the town, and Ray hooks up with Chloe (Clemence Poesy) a production assistant.  While Ray is on a date with Chloe, Ken receives a phone call from his boss Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes) living in England, directing him to kill Ray the following day.<br /><br />Ken and Ray are hit men.  Ray has just successfully completed his first assignment, the murder of a priest.  Unfortunately since he also accidentally killed a young boy, Waters has decided that Ray must be eliminated.  Ray has been keeping busy, punching out a couple in a restaurant, and when Chloe turns out to be a drug dealer, he shoots her criminal associate Erik (Jeremie Renier) in the eye.  After scoring some drugs in Chloe's place, the night finishes with Ray and Ken, partying with Jimmy (Jordan Prentice) a dwarf actor working on the film.<br /><br />The following day, Ken reluctantly  secures a gun, but instead of executing Ray, he puts him aboard a train out of town.  Harry is mad enough to kill when Ken tells him what he has done, and comes to Bruges to handle the situation himself.  Things almost conclude without too much damage, but soon shots ring out in the quiet night, and the streets become stained with blood, in this offbeat crime thriller.<br /><br />An Academy Award winner for his short Six Shooter (2006), Martin McDonagh was also nominated for an Academy Award for his original screenplay for In Bruges.  With well developed characters, most of whom are far from admirable, the film has a certain earthy realism, to go along with a very dark British sense of humor.  In his feature film debut, McDonagh demonstrates a flair for drama, and an eye for detail.  Projectiles are a point of focus, as people die and a man loses an eye.  With Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes leading the way, the acting performances are solid all across the board.<br /><br />McDonagh features a number of twists that keep the story engaging, but when an innocent child is murdered, the odds are not good that things will turn out well.  Trouble is eminent when Harry arrives, but the violence still comes at a surprisingly odd angle.  Shot on location in Bruges, the film nicely captures some sense of the place, in what is a dark, offbeat, and at times brutal crime thriller with some unique characters.</p></br><a href="../users/AGQY11NLQJ2JL.html">AGQY11NLQJ2JL</a><br/><p>I normally pick any movie with Ray Fiennes in it for the pure, simple pleasure of watching his great talent portray an outstanding good or an ultimate evil character. As always, along the way of enjoying Fiennes' great acting, I discover other great actors. This time with this movie, I was pleased to discover the awesome talents of Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson as two hit men in hiding. The two men are hiding in Bruges as a punishment for something that went wrong with one of their operations, and waiting for further instructions from Fiennes, their boss.<br /><br />The plot seems very simple, but the moral questions that you are left to contemplate after watching this movie is the real emotional gain or maybe the mental torture that endures.<br /><br />The guilt feelings that some people are blessed to live with or others are even more blessed to never experience are some of the emotional/moral topics explored in this movie. What is more challenging and potentially devastating is the judgment of other people over the choices or mistakes we made.  How morally justified these judges are and who made them Gods on earth to judge others. Most importantly, what is a crime and what is not? What is a sin and what is not? This is a special movie that is far deeper than most of us are willing to think. enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>"In Bruges" was an unexpectedly pleasurable film.  Its title really gives nothing away as to the film's contents.  Bruges, a wonderfully maintained medieval town in Belgium, serves as the backdrop for European gangster genre film with a slowly moving but compelling pace and an exciting denouement.<br /><br />The essence of the story is that two Irish hired killers are sent to Bruges by their English boss to "lie low" after a botched killing in England.  The killing of a priest has also caused the inadvertent death of a child.  To the boss, this is unforgivable.  Indeed, it is revealed that the only reason for sending his underlings to Bruges is that so they can have a pleasant holiday before the bungling killer is, himself, killed.  When this task is also bungled, the boss, played by Ralph Fiennes, comes to Bruges to do the task himself.  No more failures by incompetent staff.<br /><br />I'll say no more about the plot for fear of giving away too much.  However, there are fine acting performances by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson as the killers.  There is also a captivating role played by newcomer Clemence Poesy as the love interest to Colin Farrell.  This girl is beautiful and excellent in her role.<br /><br />"In Bruges" will probably fail to gain a wider audience as it is deemed to be "art house".  So often, this is the kiss of death for a film.  It seems to imply no action and, therefore, no interest.  This is not the case with "In Bruges".  Guns and death form part of the story.  However, this is not to suggest that the film is a Hollywood action film.  Far from it. "In Bruges" is simply a very good modern drama with a number of fine individual performances.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />In Bruges is a hilariously-written and acted movie about two incredibly different Irish hitmen hiding out in a Belgian tourist city that's far far better than the previews indicated; with perfect comic performances by Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, and Ralph Fiennes, this is a very good movie whose ending admittedly wraps things up a tad too neatly but remains very watchable and very good.<br /><br />3/4</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>This was a pretty good, funny, black comedy. Good acting all the way around which is suprising since one of the actors is Colin Farrell who usually plays everything exactly the same way and makes some pretty crappy movies. I liked it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1.html">A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1</a><br/><p>Colin Farrell as Ray and Brendan Gleeson as Kenny, are marvelously outrageous in this dark comedy. Ralph Fiennes as Harry ("He swears a lot, doesn't he?"), adds his own darkness and humor to this excellent movie. The "Nooks and Crannies" or "Alcoves" dialogue with Ken and Yuri was particularly funny. As was Ray and Harry's conversational "shootout" scene at Marie's hotel.<br /><br />There were also a few very sad and touching scenes of Ray; flashing back to his accidentally killing an innocent young boy in the church during his assassination of a priest. And the subsequent attempt to take his own life in the park as Ken stops him. Colin Farrell gives a convincing performance as he conveys to Ken, the need to end his life. Kenny in turn, trying to talk Ray out of it, by emphasizing it would serve no purpose and wouldn't bring back the life of the child he took. A real tear-jerker.<br /><br />Thekla Reuten as Marie, is absolutely gorgeous. As is Clemence Poesy as Chloe, the only thing in Bruges that peaked Ray's interest and kept his mind off the boredom (and the dead boy). Jimmy (Jordan Prentice) the "racist midget" actor, was equally adept to bringing forth his own brand of humor and "off-color" points of view. Yes, there were some pretty bloody scenes in the movie, but not enough to detract from the overall comedy that shone through the darkness of this film.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>"In Bruges" surprised me, which is something that movies generally fail to do.  It started off as a funny and entertaining mobster-buddy movie, and after I got comfortable with that, the movie slapped me across the face with a tone shift that took me totally by surprise.  The entire movie is like that - as soon as you think you have some firm ground under your feet, it shifts.  And it works, amazingly.  "In Bruges" wasn't at all what I expected; it was better than I had anticipated.  Although I wasn't in love with the ending, it didn't make me want to throw things at the TV, either.  Definitely worth a rent for those who enjoy British crime movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>I seldom buy a DVD of a movie I've never seen and when I do, it's very rare I end of liking it but c'mon, a movie that keeps you surprised from the first scene to the last ? A movie in which the very best laugh (out of plenty) and the very biggest surprise (out of plenty too) is saved for the very last scene ?. I guess if you personify the film's punchline as character (the midget/dwarf) early on, and you make him interesting enough, the end result can be rather good.<br />IN BRUGES is the baseball equivalent of hitting for the fences, it could have easily stunk but instead they ended up hitting this one out of the ball park.<br />Certainly not for every taste but I loved it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>After a killing that went very wrong, two Irish hitmen hole up in Bruges, Belgium, and wait for their boss to tell them what to do next.  The younger thug, Ray (Colin Farrell), hates everything about the storybook-pretty city, while his older partner, Ken (Brendan Gleeson), loves sightseeing.  They meet some interesting characters and then the phone call comes from the boss - and it's bad news for one of them.<br /><br />I'd heard a lot about how wonderful this movie was and, to my surprise, it completely lives up to the hype.  It's an outstanding black comedy, very much in the same vein as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W5CA">Fargo</a>, with bad guys interacting in a small town, speaking simple dialogue that is unintentionally funny, along with some really graphic violence. Farrell (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLQN">Phone Booth</a>) and Gleeson (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6EK2Y">"MadEye Moody"</a>) are outstanding as the killers who turn out to be pretty regular guys with consciences.  They are an appealing odd couple with contrasting personalities and a deep bond between them.  Ralph Fiennes plays a loving family man who happens to be the killers' boss.  He's very good with a Michael Caine-ish cockney accent.  The underlying decency of the killers makes them sympathetic and even somewhat noble, despite their chosen work.<br /><br />With its remarkable medieval architecture and serene atmosphere, Bruges is a spectacular location.  This is a movie with beauty and ugliness, humor and suspense, and most important, a truly great script; what a winning combination.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>There is never a dull moment in this fast-paced dark 2008 film that was nominated for an academy award for best screenplay.<br /><br />After two Irish hitmen mess up a job in England, their boss sends them to the town of Bruges, Belgium.  They don't understand why they are sent there but have to listen to the boss's orders.<br /><br />One of the men, Colin Farrell, would much rather be in Dublin and complains the whole time.  He's the younger of the two and immediately finds an attractive woman to hang out with.  The older man, Brenden Gleeson, takes it all in stride and follows the boss's order which is to enjoy the town itself and do some sightseeing.  There is conflict between the two from the start but it is easy to tell there is also a deep friendship and understanding.<br /><br />The boss, who we only meet through his voice until the last part of the film, is played by Ralph Fiennes.  It's a great role and he plays it with over-the-top colorful language and a sense of viciousness as well as a sense of honor and playfulness.  How this all comes together is testimony to the skill of the screenwriter.<br /><br />It doesn't take too long for things to get out of hand.  There is non-stop action, violence and pathos.  And, believe it or not there is quite a bit of comedy.  I was at the edge of my set the whole time waiting for what would happen next.  I was horrified by some of the violence.  I laughed out loud at the funny parts.  And, mostly, I was made aware of the very imperfect human beings these characters were and how there were many sides to each of their personalities.  All of this unfolded so quickly that before I knew it the film was over and I was left with the deep satisfaction of seeing a small work of art.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>This morality tale is kept afloat by Colin Farrell's performance. The story of two hit men temporarily staying in Bruges after a botched job in which a child was inadvertently killed is really dark and sad, but Farrell brings a charm and comic touch to his character that keeps the film from being too depressing. His character maintains a strange innocence so that even when doing terrible things, the audience can continue to find him sympathetic. Playing the perfect yang to Farrell's yin is Ralph Fiennes, who plays the hitmen's unrepentant, psychotic boss.<br /><br />Ultimately, the film asks whether it's possible to escape the consequences and find redemption after doing something horrible. The answers appear to be no and maybe.</p></br><a href="../users/AMKZHBOK7VMQR.html">AMKZHBOK7VMQR</a><br/><p>Colin Farrell completely won me over with his portrayal of a conflicted irish hit man hiding out In Bruges. The story of two oddly paired guys who are forced into hiding features the city of Bruges to great effect as a background. While Farrell's character is absolutely miserable at the prospect of being stuck there, his partner played by Brendan Gleeson is enthralled with the atmosphere of the place, repeatedly referring to it as a "fairy tale place."<br />Without giving too much away, they are pursued there by a venomous underworld character masterfully played by Ralph Fiennes. The dialogue is witty in a "pulp Fiction" sort of way, the action scenes are gripping and the setting is magnificent.

Farrell plays a young Irish hitman Ray who has botched his first job in London, and is subsequently exiled to Bruges, Belgium with his mentor Ken (Brendan Gleeson) while the heat dies down in London.  Everyone's down about the problem in London - rookie Ray is heartsick over the unnecessary loss of life; veteran Ken is sanguine, but still thinks about how being a hitman will affect his prospects for heaven; Cockney boss Harry (Fiennes) views the whole situation as a matter of honor, at least according to his code.<br /><br />Profanity (more than one "f" word or derivative per minute) and violence abound (particularly in the second half), as does beautiful scenery from the "f-ing" fairy tale city of Bruges, the best-preseved medieval city in Belgium.  But what makes "In Bruges" such a fun film is the script, dialogue and performances - great comic timing by Farrell, world-weariness by Gleeson, startling emotion by the usually drab Fiennes.  His first live scene (after several by mail or phone) is a stunner.  I yelled "yeah, Ralph!".<br /><br />A beautiful drug dealer, an American dwarf actor, a cowardly skinhead, an officious tickettaker at a Bruges landmark, a testy Canadian whom Ray punches out in a case of mistaken identity, and a pregnant, courageous and observant hotelkeeper ("you guys are crazy!") make up a delightful supporting cast.<br /><br />Some viewers will recoil from the realistic violence; others from the pervasive language, but those who dial down their sensibilities a bit will be treated with a hilarious, if twisted, black comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>Ray and Ken are two hit men from London whose boss, Harry, has ordered them to lay low in Bruges, Belgium. Bruges is the most well preserved medieval town in Belgium, and its church bells, cobblestone streets, canals, and religious art work their magic on Ken. Ken wonders about their vocation. Ray hates Bruges, but one day in a medieval church his conscience awakes and he asks Ken, "do you believe all that stuff about guilt, sin, and the last judgment?" That's a good question because the rest of this character study, full of black comedy and adsurdist-surreal elements (dwarfs, obese people, racism), has to do with both men seeking redemption. "I don't wanna be a dead man," Ray says. But there is a price to pay for deeds done, both personal and professional; untangling your conscience to make a new start is not so easy, especially when the boss Harry reappears late in the film to insist upon living "by principle" in a whole different way. Warning -- this film is full of vulgar language and significant violence.</p></br><a href="../users/AN8M401S8Y6DA.html">AN8M401S8Y6DA</a><br/><p>Darkly comic tale with a revised film noir quality about two gangsters hiding out In Bruge located in a gray area somewhere between black and white that provides the back drop for an honesty of gangsters knowing their gangsters American audiences can appreciate</p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>In Bruges is an intriguing idea for a film--the consciences of thugs, killers for hire.  Since Puzo's The Godfather films and literature have been dealing rather regularly with the notion that murders are just like you and me--they have morals, they have lines they don't cross, and they get upset when their unwritten codes of conduct are violated.<br /><br />And that's the dilemma with the main characters here.  One has to off the other because the other accidentally killed a child while taking out his intended target.  When the film begins the pair has just arrived in Bruges: they're mismatched, tired, and they argue a lot.  It's also not clear at first who they are or what they do, but they are somewhere between hopeless and deeply violent--always an interesting combination.  For a while the whole thing was reminding me very strongly of Harold Pinter, particularly The Dumbwaiter, with its unlikely protagonists dealing with existential angst.  But then things divert.  They get rather interesting when one of them men meets a cutie who sells drugs on movie sets and robs tourists.  He bumps into her because a local production company is shooting a movie starring a dwarf (he does not like to be called a midget) and the small man will figure in the ending in a big way.  It's all very convoluted...<br /><br />And well-done.  Henry James once famously said that if you introduce a gun on the first page of a novel by the end it must go off.  A lot of guns go off here, but more to the point, every element in the story, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, plays a key role in the ending.  Even such a simple fact that the hotel clerk is pregnant has consequences.  People who just appear for a moment will come back in a significant way.  A couple of overweight tourists, a diner who does not like patrons smoking even though he's sitting in the smoking section, a sight-seeing boatride early on, all of these seemingly incidental details figure in the outcome, in ways you will not foresee.<br /><br />So why ultimately does the film fall short?  I don't know.  When the curtain fell, I didn't feel much, other than "Hm, clever."  I think the script and the director were so concerned with all the contrivances that they didn't give their people enough room to breathe.  It's all a little *too* neat.  We don't care about the thugs that much.  The most interesting one, because he seems the most conflicted and selfless, is Brendan Gleeson.  Believe it or not, the film may be that rarity of rarities, *over*written.  Having just watched and reviewed a completely different type of flick, Notting Hill, I can assure you underwritten is far more common these days, so this is an odd complaint to be making.  But while I found myself admiring In Bruges for its storytelling mechanics, I also felt strangely cold and uninvolved throughout much of it.  (The most interesting scenes to me involve Colin Farrell's love life.)  In Bruges has laughs, surprises, and excellent pacing.  But it does not have that elusive thing called heart.<br /><br />There are also some moments where technique and slavish attention to that tightly-wound structure make for some unnatural moments.  Not to give too much away, but it's hard to believe all that killing in the final act could go on without cops arriving on the scene, without people getting just a bit more upset than they do.  A lot of guns go off and a lot of people die, and it all just seems to happen...because it has to, to tie up the loose ends.  In real life the violence would never go on so long and so casually, so after a while I began to feel everyone was more interested in the machinations of the screenplay than in anything that resonated.  Some reviews have likened In Bruges to a Mamet play.  I often have that same problem with his work--internally ingenious, but there's this suffocating quality to it all that's hard to explain.<br /><br />Still, this movie is worth seeing.  It's unusual, it's funny (when it's not violent), and the romance gives it an energy and a spontaneity.  It's not Pinter, but it might get you in the mood for some Pinter.  It may also make you want to go to Bruges yourself.  Just be careful if you're standing underneath the bell tower...</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>For some reason, I just never made it to the theater to see "In Bruges", the new film starring Colin Farrell as Ray and Brendan Gleeson as Ken, two British hit men who flee to hide out in Bruges, Belgium when Ray accidentally kills a little boy during one of his hits. Their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes) wants them out of the picture until the heat dies down, so he sends them to his favorite place in the world, for a little holiday.<br /><br />"In Bruges" is a type of film I am generally inclined to see; a gangster film, filled with interesting character actors, some humor, some action, and an exotic locale. But I never made it to the theaters and decided to watch it on DVD recently.<br /><br />As soon as Ray and Ken arrive in Bruges, Ray is immediately ready to leave; he needs action, excitement, things to do, London, Glasgow and Dublin excitement. Sleepy little Bruges doesn't offer any of this. Ken, on the other hand, is smitten with the old world charm and wants to play the tourist, visiting all of the churches and historical sites, learning about them. Ray thinks he is mad, but they have to stay put until Harry calls with instructions and he tries to play along. They stumble across a movie set one evening and Ray eyes a beautiful woman, Chloe (Clemence Poesy, Fleur DeLacour in "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire") who agrees to a date. A midget actor enters the picture and they miss a call from Harry who is, kindly, very upset when they don't answer the phone and he realizes they aren't awaiting his instructions.<br /><br />The problem with "In Bruges" is that it isn't very funny. At various times, there are bits of drama, bits of romance, bits of strangeness, bits of gangster-noir, bits of mildly amusing stuff going on. But these various, and disparate elements don't mesh into the whole the filmmaker is hoping for.<br /><br />After Ray and Ken arrive in Bruges, we watch as they interact and learn about their relationship and why they have been exiled. This is the best part of the film because we get a real vision of the characters, a real feel for them. Then, the film introduces other characters and the film begins to become increasingly unfocused and moves in too many directions.<br /><br />Colin Farrell is good as Ray. You get a real sense for how his life is spiraling out of control; he is clearly distraught about the death of the child he killed (which is shown and explained in a brief flashback) and this leads him to look for ways to deaden the pain and to divert his mind. When he meets Chloe, he unexpectedly finds himself attracted to her, as more than a one night stand, because she is very different from the other girls he meets; challenging, exciting, confident, unexpected and independent along with the requisite sexy. Once they meet, he almost begins to think he might be able to live in Bruges.<br /><br />Brendan Gleeson is also good as Ken. Sent to chaperone, he tries to make the most of the trip and take in the sites, referring to a guidebook and giving an uninterested Ray a history lesson. Then Harry tells him the real reason for his trip and he spends some time trying to work out all of the issues before deciding he can't complete his assignment.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes is good as Harry, the crime boss who tries very hard to maintain a certain image but isn't beyond using a lot of fowl language. Speaking with a harsh, working class accent, Fiennes reveals his character's origins that help to show us how determined and desperate he is to maintain his place in life.<br /><br />But as the film continues, it takes on an almost hallucinatory quality that just doesn't work. By the time of the inevitable showdown between the three leads, the story and characters lose any tenuous connection they may have already had and "In Bruges" becomes a film that is worthy of a DVD rental and little else.<br /><br />My mind was clearly trying to give me a subtle message. "Save your money, wait for the DVD". Thornhill is good that way.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA.html">A3NH7PYU4AD5GA</a><br/><p>Another delightful little British black gangster comedy. Think of: Sexy Biest (w Ben KIngsley). Snatch (w Brad Pitt, Benicio dT ...). Layer Cake (w Daniel Craig). These guys have figured it out. Usually high class actors (here R.Fiennes, who is much more convincing as a bad guy than otherwise, and the quite capable Colin F., who had been a bit overrated for a while, but he really is quite talented).<br />A basically simple plot (a hit man has screwed up, causing collateral damage; the boss needs to remove him, orders the partner to get it done, which turns out a problem...) runs into obstacles because the protagonists develop unexpected attitudes. Slapstick with guns.<br />(Disclaimer: let me add that the headline is not my opinion, but a quote from Colin Farrell's character Ray, who thinks that Bruges is a s-hole; I fully disagree with that crass opinion, Bruges is as nice a place as you are likely to find in the whole of Belgium. On Tottenham I am not an expert.)</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson turn in truly remarkable performances as two hit men on the lam in Bruges, Belgium, of all places. Colin Farrell's Ray is none too bright, comical, guilt-ridden, immature, and he suffers from a hair-triggered hot temper. As he clownishly mugs his way through the early part of the movie, pouting and sulking like the kid he is, his face becomes a rubbery map of his utter disdain for the cultural beauties of Bruges while his thick black eyebrows dance up and down mirroring his mood changes. By shooting a blank in a man's eye, he starts a chain of inevitable events that lead to tragedy.<br /> Gleeson's Ken, sensitive, bright, also funny, falls in love with the architectural charm of the Medieval city. For brief moments it's a Laurel and Hardy romp between the two men. There are stunning shots of the city throughout the movie. Why is Ken chaperoning Ray anyway? Early on touristy Ken is on top of a tower. With his hand he makes an imaginary gun and pops one off on the cloddish Ray down at street level.<br /> Hilarious is the scene in which three obese American tourists ask Colin about going up in the tower. He ends up being chased by the father and dancing around him. His brilliance is evident throughout the movie as he plays a character akin to the one he played in "Cassandra's Dream."<br /> Ray falls for a girl who is part of a movie company filming in Bruges, a company that includes a dwarf, a character that becomes crucial to the plot. Rays says, "They're filming midgets." Drugs, sex, and jealousy are introduced, and Ray's fateful journey proceeds a few more paces into inevitability like a Greek tragedy that cannot end until all is settled.<br />Late in the movie Ralph Fiennes turns in a great performance as a manic, rabid killer-boss.<br />The movie was written and directed by Martin McDonagh. For those familiar with his plays on Broadway and elsewhere ("The Lieutenant of Inishmore, "The Pillowman," "The Cripple of Inishmaan"), they will know to expect theater of the absurd inane dialogue, wild swings between the comic and the violent, lots of blood and gore, black comedy, and brilliant story set-ups and plotting.<br />I watched the DVD in widescreen (not bad), but I turned on the English subtitles because Farrell's Irish brogue defies quick comprehension by the uninitiated. This is a masterful movie, but be aware it's violent and bloody. But awfully funny too. Black comedy, anyone?</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>The undeniable charm of In Bruges lies in it's lead cast and the dynamite direction and script from Martin McDonagh; who weaves a tale of hitmen Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson).  Ray is the rookie who recently made a horrible mistake during a hit, while Ken is the wily veteran who seeks to help the lad out any way they can.  Under orders from their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes), they are holed up in Bruges; a small, tourist town in Belgium, which becomes quite a big factor as things develop and slowly spin out of control.  If you've seen trailers or previews of In Bruges, you may think this is a straight out dark comedy.  Well, while it certainly features it's share of comedic moments (mostly by Farrell), In Bruges is better described as being the well-paced and just plain refreshing gangster drama that deserves your attention.  Farrell, Gleeson, and Fiennes are spectacular and magnetic, the dialogue is addictive, and the film's conclusion is just plain shattering.  All in all, In Bruges more than deserves your attention, and even if you've never heard of the film and the description tickles your fancy, check this out.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>This is an absolutely delightful film. Just how good In Bruges was took me by surprise. For one thing, the scenery was absolutely breathtaking--"it's like a fairy tale and all that." Personally, I'd take the same interest that Brendan Gleeson's character had in the city's architecture and beauty, but all of that is small beer compared to its plot and the excellence of the performances. I don't know much about Colin Farrell but loved him as Ray. He's very engaging and you can't help but cheer for him. Ralph Fiennes was actually the highlight of the film in my view. You can't wait to see him in person after his phone conversations and basically he becomes our primary focus once he appears on screen. In Bruges is a perfect mix of drama, action, and comedy--a combination that conforms to my taste as if it were made of spandex. It's a jolly good time and a great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>It's a really tough task to make a movie that can be both hysterically funny and tragically sad at the same time.  Don't do it right and you can have yourself a movie that feels uneven and awkward.  That is not the case with "In Bruges," which has to be my favorite film of 2008.  This is a film where the characters and even the location are the real stars.<br /><br />Ken and Ray are hit men who have to hide out in Bruges when a hit goes wrong and Ray ends up accidently killing a kid.  Their boss, Harry, is none too happy with the end results and orders the two to hide out while he figures out what needs to be done.  Laying low is not exactly the easiest thing for these two, seeing that Ken is completely taken away by Bruges and must sightsee.  Ray, on the other hand, can't stand the bloody place and just about offends everybody who crosses paths with him--and let's not forget he has the most abnormal fascination with midgets.  Ray also is feeling a lot of guilt and sadness over the poor little boy he accidently killed and has no idea if he can ever make things right again.  All of this equals one vacation that they, nor you, will never forget.<br /><br />I cannot express how much I love this movie.  It is weird to encounter a movie that has both equal elements of comedy and tragedy.  Because of this, you must sit and watch it all the way through before you can come to a concrete conclusion about the film, and I also highly recommend seeing it more than once.  My appreciation and love of the movie grows with each viewing.  There are so many memorable lines and scenes that will sure enough make this a cult hit within good time.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, the characters and location are the real stars rather than plot.  Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson make a great team and really convince you that they are in fact "Ray" and "Ken."  And I cannot forget Ralph Fiennes who is both chilling and surprisingly even a bit sympathetic with his character.  The movie is brilliantly written, shot and directed.<br /><br />I have to add that the DVD looks GORGEOUS.  I could've sworn that I was watching it on Blu-Ray.  The DVD includes a couple of behind-the-scenes featurettes.<br /><br />"In Bruges" was an amazing experience for me, and it's one that I'll never forget.  I love it when films dare to be different and refuses to be something where you can predict everything that is going to happen frame-by-frame.  There are surprises in this movie, yes, but nothing that happens in this movie happens without a reason.  I really hope more people will check it out.  It's destined to be a classic, or at least that's the way I see it.  - Michael Crane</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>This movie is advertised on the box as being a comedy.  It is not a bit funny at all. The premise of gangsters shooting it out in the beautiful city of Bruges is what is supposed to be the comedic element I suppose.  This may not be the fault of the people who made this movie however.  It is clearly a dark drama that they tried to inject a little humor into but it's not a dark comedy at all.  I guess a small boy getting his head blown off in a church is funny to a drug addict mentality; but for most of the people on this planet , this is not humorous.  And even worse than this is that you have to sit through  a 15 minute scene in the middle of the movie in which people do alot of drugs and say stupid rascist comments , and scenes in which people think about things on drugs which distort all reality anyways are always the ultimate bore.  The acting however is first class in this movie and the characters are well developed.  The box warns that this movie isn't P.C. and that's fine but if they had said this is a dark drama with a few comedic elements they would have been saying the truth.  Still colin ferrel and the rest of the cast do make the characters engaging enough to forgive the weaker elements of the movie.  I don't think this was sold to the theaters as a dark comedy so I can at least cut the filmaker some slack on that issue.<br />He clearly has talent and he may have been trying to be hip by adding the endless boring drug taking and talking scene; but a good editor would have shortened that scene and focused more on the solid acting of gleeson and ferril as these two men bond together.  And the best friends you have are not party friends, but  are those who are  bonded to you by your real experiences in life. Ironically the character that Brandon Gleeson plays understands this and this means the filmaker did too, he just got sidetracked by the now outdated idea that showing alot of drug usage makes a movie cool.</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>In Bruges was just not my cup of tea.  To be fair, I will say right up front that my husband loved it.  However, this movie did not appeal to me in the least.<br /><br />First of all, this film is in NO WAY a comedy, not even a dark comedy.  It is a very dark drama that has some admittedly funny moments.  But advertising it as a comedy misleads the audience.<br /><br />In Bruges details the odd morality and sense of right and wrong held by a group of hit men.  When one of the group accidentally kills a small child, the boss sends him and his partner to the lovely, historical city of Bruges for a two week cooling off.  The movie centers around the two hit men on vacation, and how they spend their time while waiting to hear from their boss.  When the bossed finally makes contact, you get the ending you expect from the beginning.<br /><br />My issues with In Bruges stem from the gratuitous, horrific violence of this film.  Yes, yes, it is about hit men, but I do not ever need to see a child being shot in the head.  It was completely unnecessary, and the information could have been conveyed in a number of different ways.  Clearly the director was going for shock value.  The movie was also full of drugs, stupid racist comments, and plenty of f-bombs.  While bad language does not normally offend me, I do prefer that it not be every other word.  Again, shock value.<br /><br />Overall, the acting in this film was very well done.  Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson both do an excellent job in their roles, and are thoroughly believable.  Their friendship is actually quite touching. Bruges itself is charming - a lovely backdrop for a film.<br /><br />In Bruges has been compared to Pulp Fiction.  However, I did not care for that film, either.  I want to be entertained when I watch movie, and I do feel this film could have been extremely entraining.  There IS a good story here.  It is just not carried out well, IMHO.</p></br><a href="../users/A153NZD2WZN5S3.html">A153NZD2WZN5S3</a><br/><p>Hit-men had found refuge in Bruges, Belgium, just being involved in a new string of crimes, sex and murders.<br /><br />As to reviewer, a bit long, boring and not so generally entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>An acting exercise with some humor and interesting characters.

He had previously won an Oscar for the Best Live Action Short in 2005 for "Six Shooter."  The film mixes comedy and blood in an oddball romp.  Colin Farrell who is well known for films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FIHN5M">Ask the Dust</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000189LE2">Veronica Guerin</a> & <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLQN">Phone Booth</a> does a good job as the jumpy assassin Ray.  Ray makes the mistake in a church hit of accidentally blowing the head off of a young boy.  This causes he & his partner Ken to lay low for a while in Bruges, Belgium, a town where purportedly nothing ever happens.  Ken is played by Brendan Gleeson who is perhaps best known as Evil Eye in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W7414C">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Widescreen Edition)</a> as well as his appearance in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001MDP3G">Cold Mountain (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>.  The fact that Ken is gay and Ray is not does cause a bit of restlessness, particularly on the part of Ray who anxiously waits to go round the town where he bumps into a girl watching a film being made.  Their boss Harry calls Ken and tells him to put a hit on Ray, which then has bad guy chasing bad guy.  Ralph Fiennes who had Oscar nominations for "Schindler's List" & "The English Patient" shows up to finish the job Ken apparently couldn't do.  Eric Godon makes a nice appearance as the lowlife Yuri.  This film is pure black comedy with the emphasis on characterization and finding levels even within a criminal life.  This classic marriage of opposites worked for me.

So what can we glean from this little factoid? What hath Tarantino wrought? Well, for one thing, the genre tag "hit man comedy" has now officially entered the cinematic lexicon. And, by the looks of things, (love it or loathe it) it is here to stay.<br /><br />The latest example is a film that reportedly, er, knocked `em dead at the 2008 Sundance festival-Martin McDonagh's In Bruges. A pair of Irish hit men, Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray (Colin Farrell) have botched a job in London and are exiled to the Belgian city of Bruges, where they are ordered to lay low and await judgment from their piqued Dublin employer (Ray Fiennes).<br /><br />Ken is enamored by the "fairy tale" ambience of Bruges, with its intricate canals and well-preserved medieval architecture, and decides to go the tourist route. The ADD-afflicted Ray, on the other hand, fails to see the appeal of "old buildings" and would just as soon plant himself in front of a pint for the duration of his purgatory. Initially, Ken lures the reluctant Ray into joining him for sightseeing with the promise of some pub time afterwards. However, it quickly becomes evident that Ray lacks any kind of discernible social filter, displaying a general disregard for local mores and folkways. Ken decides that the best way to stay low profile would be to let Ray pass time as he wishes.<br /><br />In order to avoid spoilers, I won't elaborate much more on what ensues, other than to say that Ray wanders off and finds himself a love interest and enjoys escapades like a coke binge with a "racist dwarf" while Ken finds himself thrust into a moral and ethical dilemma that fuels the dramatic turn of the film's final third. Toss some heaping tablespoons of raging Catholic guilt, existentialism 101 and winking Hieronymus Bosch references into the mix, and voila! (The Sundance crowd swoons...)<br /><br />So what exactly has McDonagh cooked up here? Well, as much as I'd like to be able to tell you that it's "an original dish", I'd have to call it more of a "sampler plate" featuring a generous wedge of Quentin Tarantino and a few tidbits of Guy Ritchie, sprinkled with a taste of Brendan Behan. If you're a fan of dark (very dark) Irish humor, you'll likely get a few decent chuckles out of playwright McDonagh's brash and brassy dialog (and marvel at his creative use of the "f"-word as a noun, adverb, super verb and adjective). Unfortunately, the humor doesn't fold so well into the mix with the generous dollops of dramatic bathos and queasy violence. Also, some of the more decidedly un-PC jokes fall terribly flat.<br /><br />That being said, there are some strong performances here, almost in spite of the film's uneven tone. Gleeson and Farrell vibe a Laurel and Hardy dynamic together that works very well; you almost expect the doughy, exasperated Gleeson to exclaim "Well, it's a fine mess you've gotten us into!" every time Farrell throws more gas on the fire with another one of his Tourette's-like outbursts. Farrell has not previously impressed me as a nuanced performer, but in this film he proves to be quite deft at navigating the tricky waters of black comedy (that unibrow sure comes in handy). Gleeson (a world-class actor) is superb as always. Fiennes, who seems to be channeling Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast (by way of Michael Caine) goes way over the top with his archetypical caricature of a "hard" Cockney gangster, but he appears to be having a grand old time just the same.<br /><br />I had an "OK" time on my little Belgian excursion with Ray and Ken; and the location filming does make for a great travelogue, as Bruges truly is a beautiful city-but In Bruges may not be the ideal cinematic getaway for all tastes. A guarded recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>In Bruges (Martin McDonagh, 2008)<br /><br />There comes a point in certain movies where you start to understand how all the seemingly disparate pieces of plot, character, and setting come together. In general, when you're dealing with a mystery/thriller, the best time for this to happen is as close to the final frame as possible. Think, for example, of the shock of revelation in the final two minutes of the best modern example, The Usual Suspects. The master of this sort of thing when it comes to stage productions is Martin McDonagh, whose The Pillowman may be the single finest play of the past thirty years. The interesting thing to note here is that when you're dealing with a mystery/thriller in formats other than the screen, the genre's best works often put that moment of revelation much earlier, as is the case in The Pillowman (or, in the world of the novel, Graham Greene's The End of the Affair). McDonagh, however, knows the difference between stage and screen. Which is kind of rare in and of itself.<br /><br />In Bruges is a story about two hit men, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson), who are instructed by their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes), to take a couple of weeks off and go see the sights in Bruges, a medieval Belgian town. Young, impetuous Ray can't stand the place from the moment he steps off the train; older, easier-going Ken is enchanted by the architecture (though not so much the tourists), but in the back of his head, he's wondering why the boss sent them here, of all places; talking it over in the pub, the two come to the conclusion there's a job to be done here, and the boss just hasn't told them what it is yet.<br /><br />That's about all I can tell you about the plot, for in true McDonagh style, mini-revelations start popping up pretty early on. You don't really need to focus on the plot, though, to have a lot of fun with this film, which despite being a pretty straight thriller is laced with all kinds of dark, absurd comedy. In fact, it sets itself up to be a character study of Ray, and so we expect in the back of our heads that, as with most character studies of this type, the plot is going to take a back seat to quirky characters anyway. (And this is one of those times when I catch another facet of the brilliance of a movie when I'm sitting here writing the review instead of while I was watching the flick.) That never really happens; the character-sketch aspects of this movie are very well-balanced with the plot aspects. We in the western film world are well-used to seeing basically plotless character sketches or plot-heavy films with cardboard cutouts in place of actual characters. Even when you do get a plot-heavy script that's got three-dimensional characters in it, it's still a plot-heavy script. McDonagh strikes a very fine balance here, and while his foot does slip occasionally, most of the time when you think this has devolved into a character sketch, you're wrong. McDonagh just hasn't thrown the right pieces at you yet for it to all make sense. (And despite what it may sound like, I'm certainly not saying these scenes can't simply be enjoyed for what they are; the drug-fueled party Farrell and Gleeson have with Jordan Prentice would be hysterical as its own separate short film, with no other context.)<br /><br />In Bruges ended up on a lot of ten-best-of-2008 lists, and rightly so. Definitely worth looking into, and the sooner the better. **** ?</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>In 2002 we met this up-and-coming actor named Colin Farrell as he stole scenes from the very charismatic Tom Cruise in the sci-fi thriller `Minority Report' (I know that his big break came in 2000 with `Tigerland', but that film did not bring any kind of household name status).  The following year Farrell showed up in a slew of box-office big names like `S.W.A.T.', `Daredevil' and `The Recruit', and he showed surprising depth of character development in the underrated and underseen `Phone Booth'.  It was 2004 though, that was to bring him into the big leagues; sort of.  In 2004, at least in the beginning of the year, he was on the top of everyone's Oscar predictions for he was starring in two very controversial and highly anticipated films.  There was the independent `A Home at the End of the World' and the Oliver Stone epic `Alexander.  Sadly, both films failed, and while Farrell showed some strength in `Alexander' (I loathed his turn in `A Home at the End of the World') it wasn't nearly enough strength to stand out come Oscar time.  Since that fateful year it seems as if Farrell's star has faded.<br /><br />This brings us to 2008; to be more exact, it brings us to a whole new Farrell.<br /><br />I had all but given up on Farrell as being a serious actor and actually utilizing the talent I saw in `Phone Booth' when I happened to stumble onto a series of reviews for this little film.  I had read raves calling this Farrell's finest performance to date and so the fact that it was a gangster film (of sorts) and took place in Europe (with accompanying accents) and co-starred Ralph Fiennes all factored into me deciding to give it a shot.<br /><br />Let me just say this now; one of the best films of the year, easily.<br /><br />`In Bruges' tells the story of two hitmen, Ken and Ray.  Ken is older and wiser than Ray.  He possesses a certain calmness that comes from confidence and a level of comfort.  Ray is young and green, which leads way to fleeting spells of panic and uncertainty.  After Ray botches a job (his first at that) the two of them are sent away to a small medieval town (Bruges) to hide out, lay low, until they receive further orders from their boss Harry.  While in Bruges the two of them go through levels of self discovery that help shape them into the men they truly desire to be.<br /><br />Writer/director Martin McDonagh has marvelously crafted a film that both exciting and intelligent.  It never sacrifices either for the other.  The film is never boring, for it is filled to the brim with action and charisma.  Both lead actors (Farrell and Gleeson) compliment one another flawlessly by playing two opposite ends of the spectrum.  Gleeson embodies Ken with this paternal warmth that helps add layers of humanity to this contract killer, especially as the film progresses and his true relationship with Ray is revealed.  Farrell ditches the paternal warmth for wit and charisma.  His portrayal of Ray is so real and natural.  We believe his faux performance (Ray's performance is faux; Farrell's performance is genuine).  We understand the mask that Ray puts up to hide his own insecurities, and as his past is revealed and his motives are unveiled we crumble for him; and this is only made possible by Farrell's undeniably natural performance.  Not one word spoken, not one movement made, not one moment of this performance is sour.<br /><br />Honestly, so far it's the best performance I've seen this year; by anyone.<br /><br />`In Bruges' tackles with grace and a fair amount of bloodshed the subjects of loyalty, friendship, morals and ultimately; atonement.  This is proof that genre films of this nature (the whole gangster, murder, hitman type genre) don't have to be riddled with plot holes and littered with poor acting.  `In Bruges' is brilliantly written and expertly executed.  It is not only thought provoking and haunting, but it is witty, charming and quotable (this film is filled to the brim with memorable lines).  The acting is marvelous (look also to Ralph Fiennes who has a nasty turn as Harry, as well as Clemence Poesy who serves as Farrell's love interest Chloe) and McDonagh's direction is spot on perfection, taking in the serenity of the city without losing the intensity of the situation.  This is a hit on every level that will satisfy any and every film enthusiast.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>As you start watching this film, hopefully without any prior expectations, you're taken in by the absurd hilarity of two hitmen sent to a sleepy Belgian town and their pathetic attempts at being touristy while waiting for further instructions. The lopey banter between them and among the people they find is fascinating and often laugh-out-loud funny. The character development is deft, twisted.<br /><br />But as the real purpose of their trip becomes clearer, the film  takes a progressively darker turn. By turn ferocious and feeling, it grabs you right up to its soul-stretching finale. Bruges is quite a town, and treated with all the pizazz it richly deserves, but the real juice here is in the spectacular acting. Ferrel is spot-on in the skin of his bumbling criminal feeling remorse, Fiennes a walking dichotomy between mania and scruples, and Gleeson's mellowing middle-aged pro a fine breath of sanity amid insanity.<br /><br />This is McDonagh's first movie after what seems to be a successful run as a playwright. His choice of climax here is not for the faint of heart; he clearly had a ball going plum off his nut. But when you are done, you know you have watched something hypnotic, something rare, something ultimately a provocative rumination over the conflicted humanity of even the most 'evil' among us. McDonagh the new film director has a firm spot on my watch list.<br /><br />This is quite simply among the most eminently ownable DVDs around. Get it pronto, you'll be seeing it more than once.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>Just watched this last night on dvd.... I enjoyed this artsy, quirky film immensely and enjoyed that it kept me laughing at unexpected moments with its dark humor! The acting, storyline and the dark comedy on the whole makes "In Bruges" an excellent movie to watch...<br /><br />Must say that "In Bruges" is also a refreshing change of pace in terms of movies that are the usual slapstick comedies that get old to watch after a while!</p></br><a href="../users/A3EUSH8DPW75LR.html">A3EUSH8DPW75LR</a><br/><p>IN BRUGES is a delight of a film and far surpasses any expectations viewers may have.  It is a unique film.  It is not a true comedy, not a true drama and not a true crime caper yet mixes part of all three perfectly to glorious results.  The wit and intelligence in the story and dialogue are an unexpected gift and a rarity in films today.  Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson star as two hit men who are sent to the city of Bruges to stay and await contact from their crime boss Ralph Fiennes.  Also seems that Farrell's character Ray had accidentally shot a young boy in his previous ordered hit and much of the story subtly evolves around all the character's dealings with this act.  All three leads are superb but Colin Farrell is the true star here and shows a deft hand showing his true comedic abilities as he portrays the troubled hit man.  His performance is at times hilarious and sometimes heart wrenching.  He also does the true comedic trick of letting his co-stars also shine while being the true comedic foil.  His multi-dimensional characterization here is a highlight of his career.<br /><br />And the blu ray transfer of this excellent film truly shows all that blu ray has to offer.  Yes, this is an action film but most of it is dialogue driven and not the type of film one might expect to gain so much from blu ray.  But from the picture to the audio this picture shines.  The video transfer rivals the best out there.  Clarity is excellent.  Facial close-ups and the lovely scenery are totally crisp.  Black/white ratio is excellent and colors pop.  Flesh tones are very realistic.  Be it a day or night scene this film excels.  And the DTS-HD Master 5.1 audio adds the needed punch.  Dialogue is always strong and clear and the film has a lovely musical soundtrack that is always in the background.  Surround speakers are utilized to great effect for this.  And when the action sequences come up all speakers are used superbly for a great experience.  And the flow from dialogue to action is seamless.  Everything about the blu ray transfer takes this excellent well crafted film and raises the bar immensely.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PR6NXG0PA3KY.html">A2PR6NXG0PA3KY</a><br/><p>... but I laughed out loud at the conscience-stricken killer's suggestion that it was a circle closer to Hell than Bruges. When I laugh out loud at a film I'm watching by myself -- and I did laugh out loud more than once -- that film automatically gets my five-star rating.<br /><br />I'm not gonna waste a lot of college-seminar training on an exegesis of this flick. I take it to be a spoof of the genre, a totally tongue-in-cheek satire of fashionable amorality. Some reviewers have compared it to Tarantino. Okay, but it reminded me more of the Coen Brothers, though it wasn't quite THAT funny and it didn't have the ripples of mordant social criticism of a Coen flick.<br /><br />I prefer NOT to recognize actors. When I don't recognize them, I can assume they're acting. The only one I recognized in In Bruges was Ralph Fiennes; I knew I'd seen him before but I couldn't have said when or where. His was the comic villain role and he played it with gruesome delight. Colin Farrell seems to be a household name for other reviewers; I thought he was uproarious -- glum, crass, stupid, Sunday-schoolish -- as the hit man who botched his first hit and missed his merit badge for amorality. Brendan Gleeson was a jolly old elf of a veteran killer with a heart of gold. The city of Bruges played its role of tainted beauty to perfection, an old Medieval tart all gaudied up for tourist johns. I hope the jade got beaucoup Euros for selling itself to the producers of this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N5XIM9R2OQH0.html">A3N5XIM9R2OQH0</a><br/><p>Anyone making a movie featuring two philosophical hitmen is practically begging to be accused of ripping off Pulp Fiction, but it turns out the similarities between In Bruges and Quentin Tarantino's most famous work pretty much end there.  Where the work of the likes of Tarantino or Guy Ritchie (not to mention the recent Frank Miller adaptations) tends to emphasize style over substance (not always a bad thing, of course), In Bruges inverts the usual formula by using style to enhance substance.  It's got all the clever dialogue and unflinching violence you'd expect from a postmodern gangster film, but it's accompanied by a level of emotional depth and a view of friendship that wouldn't be out of place in a Wes Anderson movie.  Few films in recent memory (Shaun of the Dead being one recent example) have played this effectively with tone, as the movie effortlessly incorporates action, comedy, and drama, with some heavy philosophizing thrown in for good measure.  It's funny without pandering, dramatic without any histrionics, and sentimental without getting sappy.  The understated direction of writer-director Martin McDonagh suits the unusually quaint setting well, and his twist-laden plot ends up incorporating the aforementioned hitmen, a family of grossly overweight American tourists, a belligerent Canadian couple, a smoking-hot drug dealer and her skinhead ex-boyfriend/partner in crime, and a degenerate, possibly racist American dwarf actor.  There's also some nice dwarf-related humor, which is always good to see.<br /><br />Oddly, for a movie this distinctive, the plot initially doesn't seem like much of a departure from Gangster Movie Central: after a hit gone wrong (the details of which emerge pretty early in the film) British hitmen Ray and Ken (Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson) are sent to the medieval Belgian town of Bruges for a cooling-off period by their psychotic boss Harry.  The setting initially provides a source for some nice fish-out-of-water comedy (as well as a few not-so-subtle digs at Western tourists), but it's not long before the movie takes a turn into a more meditative, violent (though still frequently funny) direction.  McDonagh's offbeat approach is best exemplified by a simple conversation scene between Ray and Ken around the midway point, which segues smoothly from an earnest meditation on belief and morality to a hilarious speculation on why a middle-aged lollypop man would know Karate, with Farrell and Gleason maintaining their straight faces all the way through.  Some other scenes start to border on the surreal (particularly a coke binge with the dwarf and a few prostitutes), but the movie still manages to maintain its intelligence and solid characterizations througout.  I didn't think I'd ever catch myself writing this, but Colin Farrell turns in a brilliant, multilayered performance as the potentially suicidal Ray, whose jokey, sardonic exterior barely manages to conceal the guilt raging beneath.  The ever-reliable Brendan Gleeson is similiarly excellent as Ken, who initially appears to be little more than an older-and-wiser straight-man type but eventually emerges as a strong, loyal character in his own right.  In the other principal role, Ralph Fiennes really seems to be enjoying himself as Harry, the outrageously profane and menacing(though strangely principled) gang leader.<br /><br />Overall, I can't find much about In Bruges to complain about.  It's well-paced and sharply-written, it's got great central performances and some nice violent set pieces towards the end, and it all wraps up without overstaying its welcome.  I haven't seen many movies recently that rank high on the rewatchability scale, but this one's going to end up getting several repeat viewings.  Five stars, easy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>It would be wonderful if this creation of writer/director's Martin McDonagh won an Oscar nomination.  [There's talk.]  It is almost indescribably brilliant.  A dark, scathing almost-comedy but also a tragic drama, it simply defies easy categorization.  You could see that in the ads (the breezy tagline "It's in Belgium!" is off-pitch).  I think the marketers no doubt struggled with how to pitch this now instant classic.  Someone did their job right though: Box Office Mojo tells me this small film raked in almost $32 million, over 75% in non-US receipts.  I suspect it'll have a nice reward in DVD sales and rentals, too, as the word gets around.  It's already lodged in IMDB's Top 250 (#233 as I write this review).<br /><br />Beyond McDonagh, credit really belongs to the great cast.  Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are magic together.  I liked Farrell saying (in the Extras on the DVD) that when he saw the script, he simply had to do it.  It was that good.  Kudos to Farrell for not simply going for the big bucks in mediocre offerings.  He's shown that type of discipline before in the underrated <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002V7SOS">Intermission</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N9CN9E">A Home At The End Of The World (Widescreen)</a>.  Playboy image aside, Colin Farrell is a serious actor with an impressive body of work to his credit.<br /><br />The actors in the supporting roles were equally sublime - this was my introduction to Cl&eacute;mence Po&eacute;sy; Thekla Reuten makes Gleeson feel homey at her inn with her warm, beautiful presence; and Jordan Prentice is fabulous.  His exchanges with Farrell are priceless.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>How do you make the story of a hitman who accidentally blew a hole through a child's head funny and light? It ain't easy, but IN BRUGE does it on several levels.<br /><br />You definitely have to have a main character who can pull off something both dramatic and comedic. And that someone is Colin Farrell (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J4QWMC">Miami Vice</a>), a killer who finds he's having trouble living with the accidental death of child who got in the way of a bullet.<br /><br />Then you have to have a great co-star, and he turns out to be Brendan Gleeson (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHSVQ4">Kingdom of Heaven</a>). Gleeson has been a favorite star of mine since his American portrayal of Sheriff Keough in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000035P86">Lake Placid</a>. His combination of dramatic chops mixed with witty line delivery made him the perfect choice for this role.<br /><br />You've also gotta have some sort of tryst going on, and there's actually several of those. The primary is that of Ray (Collin Farrell) and Chlo? (Cl&eacute;mence Po&eacute;sy). Their brutal honesty with each other makes for some interesting mental sparring between the two and has some of the lighter moments within this otherwise dark dramedy. The other is that between Ken (Gleeson) and pregnant Belgium hotel owner Marie (Thekla Reuten). Ken's distant manner opens up to Marie during certain film segments, and Marie's stunning good looks and prideful appearance make her a person to be reckoned with. Another mini-tryst comes thanks to a film being produced "In Bruges" where one of its stars named Jimmy (midget Jordan Prentice) is out to have a good time with whatever women he can find (or drugs).<br /><br />Normally location wouldn't necessarily play that important of a role in a movie like this that is truly a character study of dark people who are also genuinely decent in many ways. But Bruges, Belgium IS important. After Ray (Farrell) accidentally kills the small boy, he and Ken (Gleeson) are told to "get out of town and head to Bruges." For Ken, it's like a vacation; the stunning buildings and peaceful waterways put Ken in laid-back mode. But Ray is tense, on edge, and sincerely depressed at his accidental shooting of the small boy. The two clash as soon as they reach Bruges, and their differences are mirrored in the landscape around them: swans, steeples, guns, and prostitutes.<br /><br />There's also a comparative study going on between a famous painting of Hell in Bruges, Belgium (that Ken and Ray check out), to that of the movie being filmed in town by Jimmy (Prentice) and that of the experience Ken and Ray find while visiting this quaint, Belgian community. I won't say more for fear of giving away too much.<br /><br />The final bonus for movie watchers is checking out Ralph Fiennes (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C65Z1G">The Constant Gardener</a>) as the overly-scrupulous death dealer Harry Waters. He's a family man with a mob-boss mentality who must head to Bruges himself in order to set things right. And once he's there things really heat up! Bullets fly. Bodies fall from tall buildings with resounding *splats!* And he finds himself the victim of his own moral code in the end. Nicely played.<br /><br />A warning should probably be given to those who are squeamish or don't care for the overuse of foul language. Both play out significantly in the film, but they are also integral to the characters and the life they've chosen. But you can't say I didn't warn you (the R rating is definitely deserved).<br /><br />What's more interesting to me now, though, is that I would LOVE to see Bruges in person. The extra features on the DVD include a boat trip through the canals of Bruges and point out incredible spots of interest. An added bonus, for sure. I just hope I don't see any cloaked midgets or men with silencers running around.</p></br><a href="../users/A5AIEA4LXWJH3.html">A5AIEA4LXWJH3</a><br/><p>Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The 2.35:1 video was excellent.  The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio was also excellent.<br /><br />I read "Comedy" on the outside package.  I did not find anything funny about this movie.  I would call it a "Suspense".

It's a rare delight, but I watch films for precisely these experiences, and In Bruges delivers the goods in spades. McDonagh's script cracked me up time and again with its dark, harsh humor constantly leavened by weirdly tender moments, and his beautiful direction brings Bruges to life in a very odd yet very wonder-full way.<br /><br />I love that city and have spent some very fine days wandering its cobbled streets and gazing in awe at endless gingerbread vistas out of the 12th and later centuries, and this film takes full advantage of it all. McDonagh had a flash of genius when he set this twisted little gangster tale there, as the contrast and emotional chiaroscuro of the plot dovetails perfectly with the elegant, ancient perfections of Bruges.<br /><br />But what makes this all come alive are the flawless performances of Gleeson and especially Farrell, who I think delivers one of the funniest turns I've seen on celluloid in many years. I laughed myself silly at some of his lines here. You definitely have to enjoy Irish humor and be able to decipher the thick brogues, but if you do and can you will be amply rewarded. There are some outrageously fresh bits, and when Fiennes shows up it all shifts into overdrive and can't be stopped.<br /><br />There is endless "bad" language, lots of f's and c's to go around, but that along with the occasional violence somehow seems perfectly apt and never gratuitous. This is both a comedy and a drama but somehow not a dramedy. Perhaps a comma? In any case (dative or what have you), In Bruges worked on every level for me, even the romance. Poesy is perfect with Farrell and their romance is strangely believable, mainly due to her almost slapstick gazes of love. And the deliciously ironic ending has to be seen to be semi-disbelieved.<br /><br />There was nothing that I didn't like about this film...only that it finally ended.<br /><br />Here's hoping for many more in this vein from the fertile mind and perfectly panoramic eye of Martin McDonagh.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OU415LB9I5J6.html">A2OU415LB9I5J6</a><br/><p>Nominated for the Best Original Screenplay in 2009, In Bruges deals with a couple of hit men, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) who are sent to Bruges, Belgium to hide out. While there, they are told to hide out and take in the scenery of the very traditionally gothic village. Ray prefers the big city, while Ken wants to take in the sights. While there, Ray and Ken get their last assignment from their boss Harry Walters (Ralph Fiennes), an assignment neither of them may want to take on.<br /><br />Martin McDonagh won the Oscar in 2004 for Best Live Action Short for Six Shooter. In the short film, a man, Donnelly, visits the hospital where his wife is sick only to find out that she died. During the morning hours he leaves on a train, and sits across from a man with a possible screw loose and his crew. Throughout their conversing they realize that they've all had someone close to them die a the night before, and the man and his crew present Donnelly with a gift that they believe could ease his pain. With In Bruges McDonagh made another bid for an Oscar in the Best Original Screenplay race.<br /><br />In Bruges is a brilliant story. It works on several different levels. On one level you have a man dealing with his past and a terrible thing he's done, something that makes him suicidal and keeps him trying to occupy his mind. On another level it works as something of a buddy comedy for at least the first half of the movie as Ray and Ken differ in their opinions of Bruges and how they should go about their "vacation". And then, on yet another level, Bruges is purgatory, and this is the last judgment of our main characters. At first the movie seems like a travelogue of Bruges, but when you delve deeper into the movie you realize that the scenery and the shots work as symbolism to the last level of the movie. That's one of the great strengths of McDonagh's work, he's a master at telling a story that is entertaining and has deeper meaning as well.<br /><br />The performances in this movie are outstanding. And what else would you expect from Irish and British theater vets Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes. They're battle over the soul of Colin Farrell's character is equally well written, but performed by these two heavyweights it truly feels like a war between God and Satan for a man's soul as he dwells in purgatory looking for redemption. But while their performances are great, the best performance belongs to Colin Farrell. Behind the tabloids, it's often hard to remember that Farrell is a great actor first and foremost. But here, he shows great emotional range from party boy to mourning the biggest mistake of his life, as purgatory takes through all ranges of his emotion from the best to the worst.<br /><br />I can't honestly find anything wrong with this movie. If you're a big fan of the films across the water that were directed by Matthew Vaughn and Guy Ritchie you may find this boring at times, but at the end of the day this is a great movie. I highly recommend this even to those of you who are fans of the more fast paced in your face action movies. The major thing about this movie to me is that it has depth, as well as action and entertainment.<br /><br />4.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A1ST1XBL6EQTBV.html">A1ST1XBL6EQTBV</a><br/><p>I first saw this movie late one night/early morning on HBO<br />and was enthralled in it the entire time!<br />I love a good independent film which strays off the beaten path,<br />yet in it's originality, doesn't lose or alienate with it's desire to be different.<br />A lot of times, indies rely too much on trying to shock and be esoteric that they<br />loose focus and just run haywire!---Well, this wasn't the case with "IN BRUGES"!<br />The one thing you may or may not have a problem with is the very thick irish brogue<br />that both Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson speak in during this film, but then they<br />are playing very working class lower level irish hitmen who work for the London syndicate.<br />Alot of the humour is very british and irish, but still translates well I think.<br />Gleeson plays a more seasoned, world-weary hitman who has a no miss/no mess reputation<br />in his dubious line of work.

The movie is about miserable people, living with the morally bad choices they've made, knowing that life should be better than what they are experiencing.

Fiennes character is wonderfully strange. I'm not sure this is every one's cup of tea, but I was smiling through out.<br /><br />One of the key scenes is when Fiennes character confronts a character that Farrel's character roughed up.

While the subject matter is grim, the dialog and constant plot twists keep it from becoming TOO grim; there some truly inspired lines like "I was selling horse tranquilizers to a dwarf."  If blood and/or swearing are not to your liking, "In Bruges" is not the movie for you, but if offbeat dark comedy and drama are your cup of tea, you'll enjoy this one!</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>Two hitmen check into a hotel in Bruges, Belgium for a two week hideout after they completed a "job." While in Bruges they are instructed to see the sights and soak in the city's charm by day and be by the phone awaiting the boss's next instruction at night. The two men, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendon Gleeson), could hardly be more of the odd couple. Ray is the brash young man who feels that Bruges has nothing to offer except beer that he cannot enjoy because they have to stay in the hotel at night. Ken is older, completely appreciates the "fairytale" character of the city and has no desire to act contrarily to the instructions they were given. Besides being partners, what they do have in common is that they are clearly outsiders In Bruges.<br /><br />This movie was sad, funny, maybe too graphic, a little ridiculous at the end, and not nearly the action flick that the synopsis might suggest. I enjoyed how the movie was about two men who kill for money, yet it was not about them killing anyone for money. I thought Farrell and Gleeson worked together very well, and particularly enjoyed Colin Farrell's contribution to the film.<br /><br />I was surprised that Ralph Fiennes, a bigger name than his body of work might warrant recently, took a role that doesn't even come on-screen until nearly the end. I like him and I think he does great work which carried into this film. His part was simply an exaggerated power-hungry crime boss, which may help explain my earlier claim that the movie gets a little ridiculous at the end.<br /><br />As the table turns towards the end of the movie and the characters show themselves to be more complex than they previously let on, the movie matured along their side. I thought there was a great contrast between the beginning and the end of the movie. I liked In Bruges from start to finish, and I find myself looking back on it more fondly even now.<br /><br />I recommend this movie with the following disclaimer: In my experience it is very difficult to separate a movie from it's graphic elements. So please be aware, if not cautious, of those elements in this movie. In other words, I speak highly of this movie, but it is not for everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>"Without dreaming of telling you what happens next, I will say it is not only ingenious but almost inevitable the way the screenplay brings all of these destinies together at one place and time. Along the way, there are times of great sadness and poignancy, times of abandon, times of goofiness, and that kind of humor that is really funny because it grows out of character and close observation. Farrell in particular hasn't been this good in a few films, perhaps because this time he's allowed to relax and be Irish." Roger Ebert<br /><br />'In Bruges' is one of those films that surprises you around every corner. The first impression I had was 'I have got to visit Bruges'- the film depicts such a beautiful, medieval city and every scene has a new vista. The city seems to play upon the characters- the towers, the museums, the churches, the pubs, the cobblestone square, and the canals all feed in to give us a view of the mindset of the two main characters. Brendan Gleeson, a big hunk of a man who has a face like a map of the world. Every feeling, every expression is shown on his face. Colin Farrell, is a true Irishman, Bruges to him is a 'shitpot'. He is not a sightseer, nothing nice about the place, just wants a beer in a pub and to move on. Ralph Fiennes as the boss back in London, heard on the phone and finally seen.<br /><br />These two men Gleeson and Farrell are Irish hitmen. The premise is pretty simple. They kill and one of them made a mistake and killed a child. They have been sent to Bruges to hide. The boss loves Bruges, and this is supposed to be a treat. Well, it is for Gleeson, he is the inveterate sightseer and does all the spots and enjoys it. Farrell, on the other hand hates Bruges- hia scene is beer and pubs and he wants to go home.  He realizes some fun when he comes upon a movie being filmed. He makes friends with a young woman who supplies drugs to the crew, and a dwarf who is in a dream sequence. From there on the film moves from one surprise to the other.  We finally get to see Fiennes and his surprising personality. That is all I am going to say.<br /><br />This is a sharply written and  superbly acted film. As one of my other friend's review states- this is 'Pulp Fiction' with heart and soul.<br /><br />Highly, Highly Recommended.  prisrob 06-29-08<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1844541711">Colin Farrell: Living Dangerously</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001BKBM0">A Dangerous Man</a></p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>After bungling their latest job, two London-based hitmen are sent to the much quieter city of Bruges, Belgium to await instruction.  Ray is a cocky young gun, who can't relax and can't stand Bruges and can't wait to get away.  Ken is older and wiser, and wishes he could stay longer to take in the atmosphere and history of this medieval city.  Of course, initial impressions of this odd couple turn out to be incomplete, and things aren't going to work out quite like anyone wants, and the quaint city starts to get pretty crazy.  The real fun here is the cleverness of the dialogue, and the beautifully captured delights of the city don't hurt either.  It's a small, and fairly simple film, well told and clear, and worth watching.  Nothing profound here, but solidly entertaining, with shades of Tarantinoesque dialogue and Ritchie-esque stylings.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this movie and thought it was excellent, although it's not without its flaws. But then, how many movies are perfect? I didn't mind the violence some have objected to or the frequent use of the "f" word; after all, as someone pointed out, these are hit men and not choir boys. If that sort of profanity offends you then you probably need to stick to "I Love Lucy" and "Nancy Drew" reruns.<br /><br />I found the movie quirky, funny, and even clever--perhaps a bit too self-consciousnessly clever in its attempt to knit so many diverse story threads into one cloth. The movie occasionally gets bogged down as a result in some side stories that could have been omitted, but I didn't mind that. There's enough entertainment between the quirky cast of oddball characters (which, besides the two hit men, include a racist dwarf), the fine acting by the two leads, the beautiful setting of Bruges (which I've visited and can vouch for as to its beauty), and the semi-demented dialog, that you're usually not bored.<br /><br />The story line has been told so many times that I won't reprise it here, except to say that although the two hit men characters have been compared to the famous Travolta and Jackson duo in "Pulp Fiction," in fact they couldn't be more different. In contrast to the super cool, slick hit guys in that movie, these are a couple of quirky, neurotic, bumbling, sort of lovable thugs with enough weighty existential angst for a post-modern novel. The one similarity is the verbose dialog between the two main characters.<br /><br />The movie is a bit schizoid in that the last half gets ever more surrealistic and fantastic, especially in regard to the final scene, whose outcome as shown is very unlikely (I won't say anymore so as not to provide any spoilers). But then, I saw the movie as a purely entertaining dark satire about two hit men whose lives go completely to sh_t in a matter of minutes during a botched job and then are left flapping trying to pick up the pieces, rather than a realistic portrayal of how such a situation would probably turn out.<br /><br />The negative reviews here often panned the movie because of its lack of realism; but, and I could be wrong, I think the movie is really a more than competent satire and send up of what has come to be called the "hit man comedy." If you keep that in mind and don't take it too seriously you might enjoy the movie's many strengths and not get too bent about its flaws, which aren't that serious and can be overlooked since the rest of the movie is strong.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>This is one of the best films, if not the best, I've seen from 2008.  So many films you go into with certain expectations and "In Bruges" defies them for the better.  I categorize this film with "Pulp Fiction", "The Usual Suspects" and "Memento" as recent films that actually expand the language of the cinema.  Director-scenarist Martin McDonagh does not take his cues from anyone.  Many would lump this with Tarantino and Ritchie but this is a unique work.  How many films center around hitmen where nary a bullet is fired except in flashback?  This is a somber piece about men who rue their profession and regret the choices they've made infused with a certain level of wry humor.  The film's main focus is on character but there are some fantastic story twists.  The film's setting, the medieval city of Bruges in Belgium, adds to the film's exotic appeal.  Colin Farrel finally given a role worthy of his talents, shines as the greenhorn gunman, Ray.  Brendan Gleeson gives his best performance since "The General" as the more sensible hitman, Ken.  Ralph Fiennes account of a ruthless crime boss is the best of it's kind since Ben Kingsley in "Sexy Beast".  Fiennes gives you the chills even with his disembodied voice over the telephone.  This is rough going in terms of language and violence but ultimately you'll walk away impressed by "In Bruges".</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>****1/2<br /><br />One of the outstanding movies of 2008, "In Bruges" is that rare cinematic high wire act that manages to juggle any number of seemingly contradictory moods and tones simultaneously without ever once dropping the ball.  Alternating between the absurdly funny and the deadly serious, the movie, written and directed by Martin McDonagh, offers a wise, witty and surprisingly touching take on friendship, guilt, redemption and the strange code of ethics that guides the behavior of the professional killer (those who appear in the movies at least).<br /><br />Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleason are superb as Ray and Ken, two British hit men who are sent to Bruges, Belgium to hide out after Ray accidentally kills a young boy in an assassination gone wrong.  Stuck in this strange Medieval city, the two men make the best of a bad situation, Ken by taking in the sights and immersing himself in the rich history and culture of the place,  Ray by moaning about how bored and homesick he is, all the while trying to work through the guilt of having the blood of an innocent child on his hands.<br /><br />In a screenplay crackling with irony and wit, McDonagh paints the portrait of an unusual friendship between two men who seemingly have little in common beyond their chosen profession and a mutual respect for one another. Ken is mature, well educated, even-tempered and pragmatic, while Ray is unbright, hot-headed, and easily provoked by the words and actions of others.  Yet, somewhere beneath his rough-and-tumble, sometimes rather befuddled exterior beats a giving heart and an appreciation for the good that can be found in certain people.  Gleason and Farrell give performances of immense sophistication and depth, with Farrell, in particular, creating a fully rounded portrait of a "loveable" killer.  His body compressed down into a perpetual slump while a host of conflicting emotions flutter across his expressive face, Farrell demonstrates that he has the physicality an actor needs to make a character come to life on screen.  In a much smaller role, Ralph Fiennes also makes his mark as the mob boss who has some strange notions about what constitutes morality and honor when it comes to killing.<br /><br />Add to all these various virtues lyrical direction by McDonagh, beautiful cinematography by Eigil Bryld, some colorful minor characters, and architecture guaranteed to knock the viewer's eye out - and you have one of the true movie going pleasures of recent years.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>Really interesting premise/set-up: You get a gorgeous travelogue on the truly picturesque European city of Bruges, which is the backdrop of a violent, profane gangster tale.  To further add to the theme of contrast, the film's most sensitive, likable character (played by Colin Farrell) has committed the most horrendous act in the film, and the most profane, brusque, and dangerous character- played by Ralph Fiennes in a third-act tour de force- actually has the most sensible outlook of everybody, as he attempts to undertake a type of justice for the Farrell character's undeniably appalling action. Brendon Gleeson is the most middle-of-the-road character here (a kind of stand-in for the audience, except that he's a hit man), and he attempts to work things out between everybody.<br /><br />Romance and edgy humor round out the mix, with everything bubbling along nicely and contributing to a film that's compelling and moving from beginning to end.  Just don't expect an it-all-works-out-for-everybody, hearts-and-flowers ending.  Of course, if you look at things in a kind of universal justice sort of way, maybe everything does work out the way it needed to.<br /><br />The DVD of "In Bruges" includes about an hour of extras, which give further details on both the travelogue and gritty crime aspects of the film.  Final thought: Colin Farrell is really good here, jumping between subtle, nuanced moments and comic rants about how "anyone could EVER want to visit the boring city of Bruges".  I liked him in Woody Allen's dark drama "Cassandra's Dream" and liked him even more here.  Party animal or not, this guy's the real deal.</p></br></body></html>

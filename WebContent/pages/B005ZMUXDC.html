If this movie had been made by some fledgling, no-name outfit struggling to survive, it would be hailed as a work of beauty, simplicity, and charm.  As it is, a lot of people are just groaning because it resembles so many past formulaic outings of Disney.<br /><br />But this one is particularly well-done.  There's a reason you keep seeing formulas in movies:  THEY WORK.  This is probably the best-wrought animated Disney movie I've seen since "The Little Mermaid."<br /><br />There were two things that stuck out in my mind as particularly excellent:<br /><br />1.  The completely unexpected yet captivating way that the horse Maximus stole the show from the middle of the movie onwards.<br /><br />2.  The relationship between the mother and the daughter.  This was bitingly, spookily convincing.  I don't know who wrote that, but there's more than a dose of reality in there.  For me, the mother is the most comprehensively convincing villain I've ever seen from Disney.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>In Disney's long line of animated feature films, Mother Gothel just may be its most passive aggressive big bad. It's interesting to note that Mother Gothel, for a witch, doesn't really exhibit much magical mojo. Instead she manipulates people by applying that vile eldritch technique popularly known as psychology. To me, this makes her more memorable. I think guilt trips and ego tilting are more deadly than dragons and ogres.<br /><br />"Once upon a time a single drop of sunlight fell from the heavens. And from this small drop of sun grew a magic golden flower. It had the ability to heal the sick and injured." It's how the fairy tale begins. Except that Mother Gothel, selfish witch, got to it first and proceeded to harvest the petals to rejuvenate her youth. When the Queen of the land falls ill during her pregnancy, a desperate search unearths the golden flower. The Queen's health improves dramatically and she gives birth to a baby daughter whose hair unfurls long and golden and imbued with the enchanted flower's properties. Mother Gothel, an opportunist, promptly steals away with the baby. So it happens that, each year after, on their vanished child's birthday, the king and queen and all in the kingdom loose thousands of floating lantern lights into the night sky in hopes that they would guide the lost princess back home. Crazy thing, many years would elapse, but this far-fetched, wistful plan actually will work.<br /><br />In a remote forest, confined in a hidden tower, Rapunzel gazes out each day, dreaming big dreams, open to adventure, longing to see the world. Obedient child that she is, Rapunzel heeds her mother's behest that she not venture outside, the world being too perilous for the likes of her. For years Rapunzel has made the best of it, carving out her own little world but marveling, always marveling, at the mysterious floating lights which emerge each year on her birthday. On her eighteenth birthday, her hope is that her mother will at last allow her a measure of freedom. It's cramped in that tower, what with her 70-foot-long tresses taking up a lot of room. Her hair has never been cut, lest it loses its uncanny properties.<br /><br />"Flower, gleam and glow, let your power shine. Make the clock reverse. Bring back what once was mine... what once was mine." It's what her mother, Mother Gothel, croons to her whenever she visits Rapunzel at the tower, combing her hair. It doesn't enter Rapunzel's thoughts that Mother Gothel fosters ulterior motives. Why would she? But there's a rebellious streak in Rapunzel. And when the dashing (but vain) bandit Eugene Fritzherbert - er, Flynn Rider stumbles onto her tower, she seizes this opportunity to embark on a forbidden road trip, with Flynn Rider serving as her guide. She hopes to track down the source of those floating lights.<br /><br />Disney did us a solid by trotting out TANGLED for its milestone 50th animated film. This is an instant classic, a top notch animated tale with something for the kids and the grown-ups. I think I'm past the stage of going gaga over Disney or Pixar's animated virtuosity. Nowadays, I expect it. Still, the fabulous scene in which our leads are on a boat watching the rise of the lantern lights is one of the most moving and spectacular moments Disney has ever produced. And you have to laud the work that the animators put into making Rapunzel's expressive hair come to life. The laughs come plenty, with Rapunzel's animal friends predictably delivering much of the humor, although Zachary Levi, who voices Flynn Rider, occasionally contributes an arch one-liner, including the bit about the smolder. Broadway vet Donna Murphy is very good as Mother Gothel who alternates from faux cheeriness to openly manipulative. Another fun character is Maximus, the proud and tenacious Royal Guard's stallion. You have to admire how this dedicated steed goes above and beyond to apprehend the wanted Flynn Rider. There's also a shy chameleon lizard who tries to look after Rapunzel.<br /><br />Mandy Moore anchors the movie. She's tremendous in inhabiting the role of Rapunzel; her voice is ideally suited to playing a high-spirited and inquisitive Disney princess (a princess who swings a mean frying pan). I'm probably dissing Mandy Moore's live action r&eacute;sum&eacute;, but this may be the most disarming performance she's done in cinema. Sorry, Mandy.<br /><br />For all its hip sensibilities, TANGLED still clings to Disney's traditional themes, which I think is a good move. Too much adult snarkiness could've undermined the sweetness and the heart of the story. And this story does have heart, to go along with a sweet, relatable romance, Mother Gothel's showstopping tune "Mother Knows Best," wet wi11ies, a pack of Viking ruffians to stir the plot whenever it threatens to bog down, and a thoughtful curveball ending. And a broken smolder.<br /><br />This single disc's extra features (and it's not much): "Original Storybook Openings" - two different versions of the film's prologue; and "50th Animated Feature Countdown" - which counts down Disney's fifty animated films from SNOW WHITE & THE SEVEN DWARVES to TANGLED.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>The wonderful thing about `Tangled' is that it instantly calls to mind the glory days of Disney, the years that followed the glorious `The Little Mermaid' and led into `Beauty and the Beast'; two of the greatest animated films of all time.  Yes, `Tangled' is bursting at the seams with love, danger, charm and MUSIC!  With infectious songs that swell in the heart, `Tangled' revisits the days of old, the days when Disney made us feel all warm and cuddly on the inside.<br /><br />`Tangled' makes my heart feel super happy.<br /><br />Taking the classic story of Rapunzel and giving it a facelift, `Tangled' tells the poetic tale of a beautiful young princess named Rapunzel who is kidnapped and locked away in a hidden tower by the evil Mother Gothel, a woman who uses Rapunzel's magical golden hair to stay young forever.  Over the years, Rapunzel dreamed of leaving the tower, hoping to see the beautiful lanterns the filled the sky every year on her birthday, but her mother (err, abductor) refused to let her leave, stating that her hair was too valuable and that outsiders would try to take advantage of her.  Remaining in the tower at all times was her only protection from the evils of the outside world.  Rapunzel's whole world is turned upside down the day she meets the thief, Flynn Rider.  Fresh off of stealing a royal crown, Flynn winds up hiding out in the tucked away tower that houses our young princess, and with a little persuasion, Rapunzel is able to get Flynn to agree to take her to see the lanterns.  Obstacles abound and life lessons are learned, with spunk and charm and a whole lot of beauty dripping from every frame (OMG this movie is a CGI dreamsticle).<br /><br />While the overall lay of the plot may be a bit conventional (especially concerning the `love' story angle), there is so much excitement to be found in this animated gem that one can't help but fall in love with it.  The voice work is astonishing (YES, THEY CAN ALL SING) and the emotional connection is certainly felt.  Happy endings are what Disney was made for, and they deliver a magical one that will make anyone smile.  Each scene is laid out with the viewer in mind, creating gorgeous backdrops to plop our cast of characters in, and each character certainly has a life all their own; even Maximus the horse.<br /><br />A true crowd pleasure, and every little girls dream (my daughter absolutely LOVES this movie), `Tangled' is a true return to form for Disney; a modern masterpiece of animated proportions.<br /><br />At last, I see the light!<br /><br />:-D</p></br><a href="../users/A129YBX5BVNW2.html">A129YBX5BVNW2</a><br/><p>Just finished watching "Tangled" on BLU RAY and it's everything other reviewers have said it is - and better.<br /><br />I suspect like many adults in their 50's, the last half-decent Disney we saw was "Beauty & The Beast" - and that seems like a very long time ago. Since then Disney has done some right saccarine pap, but this clever little beauty is back on track in a big way. Truly beautiful animation, great vocal work from the 3 principal leads, songs that are actually witty - characters you like and root for - and a very clever modern telling of an old tale. You can 'feel' John Lassiter's presence and heart all over it (Pixar)...and it's a genuine sensation to look at on BLU RAY (I believe the 3D version is even better).<br /><br />Very, very good indeed - well done to all involved.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>The hair looks so real! OMG it looks so real! It's so golden and shiny and I want to touch it! This is what I kept thinking when I saw Rapunzel. When I first heard of this film, I was wondering why Rapunzel's hair would keep Mother Gothel young, since I was familiar with the original tale and how Rapunzel came into the custody of the witch. However, it's explained nicely in this film with the golden flower and Rapunzel's parents.<br /><br />Rapunzel is cute. She has a lot of skills from living alone for so long, although I wish the animators didn't give her such huge eyes, it threw me off a bit.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYMJ96STIRW.html">AMYMJ96STIRW</a><br/><p>You'll read all sorts of things about this movie.

I remember being taken to the cinema as a child to see Bambi and The Jungle Book, and anxiously awaiting holiday specials showing classic Disney clips. What's more, all of Disney's releases are suitable for family viewing.<br /><br />While I appreciate all of the above, many of Disney's classic titles are formulaic. It seems like there's a princess in every story, although there are only nine official Disney princesses. The movies feature numerous songs and often start with the image of a storybook which is used to set the scene. All of those things work, but it's a little too predictable for my liking.<br /><br />Tangled is different.<br /><br />Instead of using a storybook for the exposition, it uses a narrator. The narrator is Flynn Rider, our hero, and he's sarcastic and genuinely funny. There are songs, but they are short, infrequent, and also funny. There's a princess, but she doesn't act like one. This is a story that doesn't take itself too seriously. It feels fresh and contemporary. Quite frankly, I was surprised and delighted with the whole thing.<br /><br />We learn during the opening scenes that an old woman, Mother Gothel (Murphy), possesses a golden flower with the power to heal and reverse the effects of aging. The queen is sick and needs the flower to heal her, so a party of soldiers is sent to find it. It works and newly-born princess Rapunzel (Moore) is infused with the plant's powers. Mother Gothel wants to appear young so she kidnaps the princess and keeps her in a tower. The king and queen release floating lanterns each year on Rapunzel's birthday and hope that she will eventually be found.<br /><br />Rapunzel thinks that Mother Gothel is her real mother and that she's being kept in the tower to protect her from the dangers of the real world. Her main wish is to see the lights that appear on her birthday. Her only friend is Pascal, a chameleon. He doesn't speak, but does a good job of expressing his feelings through body language.<br /><br />Flynn Rider is a notorious thief who stumbles across Rapunzel's tower while evading capture from the king's soldiers. Rapunzel hits him over the head with a frying pan and locks him in her closet. She's convinced that the outside world poses no threat to her.<br /><br />We learn that her hair has many uses. It's one way into the tower, but she also uses it to pick things up and to tie Flynn to a chair. The two enter into a bargain; he'll take her to see the floating lanterns and she'll give him back the tiara he stole. She sends Mother Gothel on an errand and leaves the tower with Flynn.<br /><br />Flynn takes Rapunzel to the Snuggly Duckling inn which is supposed to represent a sort of biker pub. The patrons aren't what they seem and end up liking her. Mother Gothel tracks the pair down and Flynn is also found by one of the king's horses, Maximus. The horse doesn't speak either, but is one of the funniest characters in the movie. He feels that he isn't appreciated, but Rapunzel wins his loyalty.<br /><br />There's plenty of action during the ensuing chase scenes, and the pair are forced to use their wits to escape all kinds of peril. Mother Gothel is the most evil character in the story, although her selfish actions are understandable when you consider that she'll die without the effects of Rapunzel's magic hair.<br /><br />There's considerable character development in the story and, being Disney, it has a happy ending. The mix of humor, action and romance works well. The characters are easy to like and there's always something interesting happening.<br /><br />Video Quality 5/5<br />I recently reviewed Megamind and mentioned that, as well as aliasing, the backgrounds appeared unfinished. Watching Tangled, the difference is easy to spot. There is so much detail and depth in each frame. Take a look at the background shots and you'll see what I mean. Leaves rustle in the breeze, clouds drift and water ripples. This image is comparable to Bolt or the recent Pixar releases. It's another perfect transfer from Disney.<br /><br />Audio Quality 5/5<br />The DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 mix also receives a perfect score. There's a lot happening at times, and every little sound is heard. Background noises such as hooves or running water enhance the experience and you'll hear things coming at you from all directions. Dialogue and music also receive the correct treatment.

In this amazing comedy-adventure, Rapunzel is a special princess with seventy feet of magical hair and she is kept in a high tower by an evil godmother named Gothel, and then, one day, Rapunzel is surprised by a handsome but silly jewel thief named Flynn Rider, and together, both Rapunzel and Flynn escaped the tower and journey to a brand new world. Along the way, Rapunzel and Flynn meet tough but friendly marauders, and match wits with a heroic and lovable horse named Maximus. Mandy Moore is at her best as the voice of the new Disney Princess and Zachary Levi is as hilarious as ever as the voice of Flynn. The special features includes trailers of other Disney hit DVD's like Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure, the Re-release of the Incredibles on DVD and a sneak preview of the upcoming Tinker Bell sequel Tinker Bell and the Pixie Hollow Games that will be broadcast on the Disney Channel.

The original "fairy tale" is hardly suitable subject matter for a Disney movie, but, as Disney tends to do, the story was adapted extensively for a modern family audience.  The result is a marvelous entertaining fantasy that is enjoyable from beginning to end.<br /><br />Mother Gothel kidnaps baby Rapunzel from her parents' room.  Gothel needs access to Rapunzel's hair because it has the ability to keep her young.  To maintain control over Rapunzel, Mother Gothel keeps her at the top of a high tower hidden in the mountains.  However, Rapunzel can see the world outside her window and her greatest fantasy is to see the flying lanterns that appear every year, strangely enough, on her birthday.  Things come to a head on Rapunzel's 18th birthday, when thief Flynn Rider comes into Rapunzel's life by scaling the wall of the tower.<br /><br />At first, this strange person frightens Rapunzel because of the stories Mother Gothel told her about the cruel and evil world outside the tower.  However, Rapunzel's desire to see the lanterns drives her to take charge of Flynn Rider as her guide to the source of the lanterns.  What follows is one of the fastest and funniest Disney animated features.<br /><br />Rapunzel, outstandingly voiced by Mandy Moore, charms everyone she meets.  She is usually cheerful and funny.  Though she is na?ve, she is also smart and clever.  She is also physically fit.  I guess there is little to do in the tower except work out.  She is also quite dexterous with her hair.<br /><br />Does Rapunzel make it to the launching of the lanterns?  Will Flynn Rider change his moderately wicked ways?  Will Mother Gothel have justice visited upon her?  What about the horse that acts like a bloodhound (you have to watch to understand - the horse is hilarious)?  You will have to watch this clever, funny, fast and charming movie to find out!<br /><br />This DVD has a dearth of extras, somewhat unusual when comparing this release against other recent Disney releases.  There are two alternate beginnings along with an explanation of both and a countdown of Disney's first 50 animated movie releases.  While this stuff is interesting, it is hardly earth shattering.  I suspect Disney is holding out more extras for a special release of some sort.  Oh well, another clever way to make money I guess.<br /><br />Disney has a good track record with its animated features.  This one is a winner and is already a favorite with our family.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/AHF97M45JFCB.html">AHF97M45JFCB</a><br/><p>Long-time readers (sufferers as the case may be) of my critical efforts may have noticed a certain pattern whereby I locate, for purpose of review, animated feature films so obscure that even the individuals responsible for their creation have long forgotten about them.  Usually (but not always), it isn't very difficult for me to find fault in these works but alas, to insure the accuracy of my whole scale of judgment, I proudly visit the latest, greatest, high-budgeted, much hyped, talk-of-the-town animated pieces as well.<br /><br />As such I think it's safe to presume you've heard of Tangled prior to indulging in my evaluation but in case you have not, a brief refresher is in order: Tangled is Disney Studios' computer-generated 2010 big budget retelling of the timeless German fairy tale Rapunzel by the Brothers Grimm.<br /><br />Tangled starts at the beginning and not just Rapunzel's beginning but her mother's.  It turns out the pregnant queen needs a bit of a miracle to overcome illness and that miracle comes in the form of a flower said to have come directly from the sun.<br /><br />With a droplet of the flower's potency, the queen overcomes her affliction and gives birth to the baby Princess Rapunzel.  It turns out the flower's amazing abilities not only cured the ill queen but found their way into the hair follicles of the yet unborn child.  Because of the young princess' magical locks, one Mother Gothel kidnaps her from the palace under the veil of darkness.<br /><br />Mother Gothel just so happens to know a thing or two about the flower's magical abilities and decides that she will stave off the effects of aging by locking Rapunzel in her hidden tower.<br /><br />Fast-forward to a 17-year-old Rapunzel with hair over ten times longer than her body; tower ridden and utterly bored when a fleeing bandit by the name of Flynn Ryder takes refuge in her hidden crib.<br /><br />Rapunzel works out a deal with the charming thief to act as her guide to the mysterious and perilous land beyond the tower and the adventure ensues the moment her bare feet feel the green grass of the meadow for the first time.<br /><br />So now that we're up to snuff on what Tangled is and how it came to be, the all-important question then centers on entertainment.  Does Tangled deliver in terms of amusement?  Absolutely and perhaps better still, it manages to do so with the first genuine signs of "classic Disney" sensibilities that have been largely absent since the industry started making the move from 2D drawn animation to computer generated 3D in the mid-1990s.<br /><br />I could be mistaken of course, but it has long since been my assertion that a majority of the CG features thus far have been created by individuals so awed by the medium itself that what resulted were closer to showcases of the technology first and foremost with story-development taking the back seat.  A sort of "because we could doesn't mean we should" mentality.<br /><br />Of course there are exceptions to this trend, many of them in fact coming from the geniuses at Pixar (which has since become absorbed by Disney anyway) on account of the fact that they seemed to be oddly in tune with what kind of stories could lend themselves perfectly to the computer-generated world.<br /><br />Disney, however, hasn't been so successful.  Anyone who has witnessed earlier solo-efforts like Valliant, The Wild, Chicken Little or Bolt can attest to the fact that while passable, none of these films could even come close to mastering the art ala Pixar.  That brings us back to Tangled.  Rather than create another attempt to cut into the lucrative CG glory shared by Pixar, DreamWorks, Blue Sky and so on, Disney finally seems comfortable (or perhaps confident) enough to get back to telling a tale their way- medium be darned.<br /><br />What results is the formula that has made countless prior Disney films ultra-successful: A slightly modernized take on a classic fairy tale, a musically laced prose (yes the characters break out into song quite frequently here), personified animals with just enough actuality left in tact to still be considered realistic, dashing heroes, perfectly timed comedic efforts, evil old ladies and just a touch of magic.  It's all here- the precise recipe that has charmed fans for years across films like Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and to an extent even Aladdin.  This time however the clarity and attention to detail that can only be achieved via the technique of computer-generated textures factor in to aid the material rather than try to make-up for a lack thereof.<br /><br />At 100-minutes, this film hints toward the marquee's return to longer runtimes and comes feeling as though that is simply how long it takes to weave its tale (rather than rushed to completion or stretched out with filler).<br /><br />The casting is, as is customary for a major Disney effort, spot-on with Mandy Moore doing a bang-up job as the title character and Zachary Levi is equally captivating as Ryder.  Additional props are due to Donna Murphy as Gothel.<br /><br />I came into this piece a bit jaded from the onset, feeling as though the classic fairy tale retold through CG has been done to death.  Perhaps four Shreks, two Happily N'ever Afters, three Unstable Fables, one Pinocchio 3K and countless other attempts will do that to a critic.  However, I must confess to having been swept up in the revelry with Tangled right from the onset.  Truly Disney retains its throne in terms of mastery of facial animation techniques and the hair textures here are absolutely astonishing.<br /><br />By going back to their roots and doing what they do best, Disney has (finally) notched its place in the computer animated feature film hierarchy and has done so without relying upon the Pixar co-brand to make it happen.  Sure John Lasseter's name finds its way to the credits as Executive Producer, it's undeniably apparent that this was a Disney piece through and through.  I like to think that had this one been released back in the 2D era it would have gone by the simple title "Rapunzel" but if we have to try to isolate Pixar's influence on the project in some capacity, surly they had to have come up with the hip title.  Ironic when you stop to consider that from a puritan perspective, this is Disney's most untangled computer-generated piece to date.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Tangled is a magical and funny movie that had my attention from beginning to end. I took my niece to see it and expected to be bored but that wasn't the case at all. I just wish that the white horse Maximus had more scenes because he's just hilarious and he's a scene stealer. I think he's the most original Disney character in awhile and he didn't even need any lines to be funny.</p></br><a href="../users/AY6A8KPYCE6B0.html">AY6A8KPYCE6B0</a><br/><p>Pixar aside, Disney hasn't made a movie this good since the renaissance 90's when we got classics like Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King, Pocahontas, Mulan, and Tarzan.<br /><br />Tangled is the story of Rapunzel and her long, lustrous, climbable hair, but like any iconic Disney adaptation there's plenty of twists and turns along the way.  The characters are all endlessly interesting, especially the two animal side-kicks who absolutely steal the show (despite being mute.)  The music is good, perhaps not '90s good, but still very enjoyable.  Mother Gothel is among Disney's best villains and her deliciously wicked song "Mother Knows Best" deserves to be among the greatest hits of all Disney musical numbers.<br /><br />The animation is, of course, breathtaking to behold--especially on Blu Ray.  The attention to detail and setting is what sets Disney apart from other computer animations.  Like the Beast's library or Belle walking through town, there are an endless number of images that will remain frozen in your mind for weeks, months, and probably years at a time.  I collect a lot of Disney movies but I still consider myself somewhat of a snob, if it's not during the Walt era (or one of the better '90s releases) I have a hard time justifying it for my collection.  With Tangled however, it is a no brainer.  This is the stuff of an instant classic, it'll be around for a long time.  You might as well take advantage of it now.</p></br><a href="../users/ASEBX8TBYWQWA.html">ASEBX8TBYWQWA</a><br/><p>Disney's 50th Animated feature is entertaining and plays well even on a standard dep TV.<br /><br /> Tangled is the 50th full-length animated FEATURE film from Disney and they are using that number to promote the film and its new DVD release. It's "interesting" that the DELUXE FOUR-DVD set (DVD+ Digital+Blu-ray+ Blu-ray 3D) is priced at $49.99 and not an even $50.<br /><br />Anyway, there are MANY reviews already posted based on the theatrical version of the film so I won't re-hash the plot here. You probably will be more interested in the home version of the film.<br /><br />As noted above, there is the 4-disc Deluxe version, but Disney has also released a 2-discv version without the 3-D disc, and a single-disc DVD version. Unless you are one of the few with a 3D TV the Deluxe version probably won't be of much use.<br /><br />To date I still haven't gone Blu-ray so I was unable to watch the bonus features exclusive to BR, which include A "Making of", Deleted scenes and two extended songs. The other two minor bonuses are on the standard DVD version. These are two interesting "original storybook openings" - running just over 3 minutes each - and a two-minute "countdown" compilation of the 50 animated features - to a soundtrack of Stevie Nicks' "Dreams" - with no identification of each film.<br /><br />I've watched the film on my standard large screen TV and its really sharp. The computer animation gets better and better. And the sound on the standard DVD was perfect too!<br /><br />As for the film itself, I liked it though I don't think its Disney's best. The songs by Alan Menken sound more like they were written for a Broadway show then for the films he previously composed for.<br /><br />So, yes I enjoyed it. And would recommend. I just wish that Disney would provide those people with standard DVD players some of the bounues that is only on the BR disc. After all,  many of these do not use the BD component.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />"Anything Phonographic"</p></br><a href="../users/A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE.html">A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE</a><br/><p>Background:<br /><br />Tangled has its origins from the German fairy tale Rapunzel by the Brothers Grimm.<br />It was first published in 1812 as part of a collection of children's tales. It is believed that this story was an adaptation from a fairy tale called Persinette by Charlotte-Rose de Caumont de La Force which was originally published in 1698. It is a story that has been beaten to a pulp, and is best know for the line: "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair".<br /><br />Even further back, this story may seem to be a modified feminized version of the Biblical story of Samson as related to in the book of Judges chapter 13. Here because Samson was a Nazarite a razor was never allowed to touch his hair.<br /><br />Marketing and Sales:<br /><br />This film was originally titled and marketed as Rapunzel, however, at the last minute the name was changed to Tangled. It is the second most expensive film ever made and most expensive animated film ever made with a budget of $260 million. Tangled is also notable for being the third-highest grossing animated film in the Disney animated canon (unadjusted for inflation), behind The Lion King ($783,841,776) and Aladdin ($504,050,219).<br /><br />Overview:<br /><br />Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) is just about to turn 18 years old. She wants a special gift, to go outside of the tower that she has been in for her entire life. Her mother, Mother Gothel (voiced by Donna Murphy) buntly refuses. As an alternative, she asks for more paint (she paints as one of her many past times in the tower). Mother Gothel agrees to go for it, but it's a 3-days journey away.<br /><br />While she is away, Rapunzel manages to strike up a bargain with Flynn Rider, a thief on the run (voiced by Zachery Levi). At this point her voyage to the outside world begins.<br /><br />Rating:<br /><br />It is quite surprising that this 100 minute animated feature has been given a rating of PG instead of G. In my opinion this may be due to the emotional and psychological content that Mother Gothel generates by her deceptive and manipulative relationship with Rapunzel. (since there is no nudity or offensive language in this film)<br /><br />Plot:<br /><br />Gothel observes a single drop of pure sunlight hit the ground, creating a magical flower with the ability to heal the sick and injured, as well as keep someone young by singing to it. Centuries past as she maintains her youth. Until the pregnant queen of a nearby kingdom gets sick. Her guards manage to retrieve the flower and make a broth out of it. The queen is healed, however, as a side-effect, her daugther is born with hair with the same magical properties.<br /><br />Gothel realises this and kidnaps the child and raises her as her own. But, every year on Rapunzel's birthday, the kingdom sends thousands of floating lanterns into the sky longing for their lost princess to return. Rapunzel desires to find the source of these lights a theit true purpose.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />This is an excellent family film, with lots of musical content as well as humor. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>I was not terribly enthusiastic about seeing TANGLED, and in fact, I didn't see it for several weeks.  But a slow Sunday afternoon came around, and having seen pretty much everything else...I was coaxed into attending.  And now the film is on my Top 10 for 2010 list!<br /><br />This is a Disney picture, with the graphic sensibilities of a Pixar film.  I know the two companies are allied, but what I mean is this:  Pixar has had the corner on smart, modern looking, genre-twisting films.  Nary a fairy-tale in sight.  And Disney has the lock on the "princess" fairy tale.  Heroine tackles adventures, including some kind of wicked witch-type character, with the help of her animal sidekicks and to a greater-or-lesser degree, the help of a male character destined to be her one true love.  And generally, the Disney movie is in the old, hand-drawn style (such as the excellent PRINCESS AND THE FROG).<br /><br />But with TANGLED, we get a terrific "princess" story, coupled with outstanding CGI animation from Pixar.  It's in 3D, and features the best 3D of the year, in my opinion.  There's a gorgeous scene where thousands of paper lanterns are released into the night sky at once, and as they carry over a lake, their number is multiplied by the reflection in the water.  The moment is jaw-dropping in its beauty...and to be honest, it's worth the price of the 3D upgrade.<br /><br />TANGLED is the story (loosely) of Rapunzel...the girl who is kept in a tall tower by a wicked old woman who accesses the tower by climbing Rapunzel's LOOOONG hair.  In this film, Rapunzel isn't merely rescued by a roaming prince.  She's spunky, smart and na?ve about the world about her.  She yearns to leave, even for a short time...and when fate puts a reluctant rescuer in her path (in the form of Flynn Rider...a charming bandit), she sets off on an adventure full of excitement, humor & romance.  And Rapunzel, with her blonde hair and green eyes, looks refreshingly different from Disney beauties of the past.<br /><br />It sounds very tired...but trust me, Disney makes all the old stand-by themes seem new and fresh.  The animal sidekicks:  a cute-as-can-be chameleon and a tough-as-nails horse.  Song about yearning to see another part of the world:  yep, but it's cute and touching.  Colorful villains: check, but this gang gets to sing one of the funniest songs since Gaston used antlers in his decorating in BEAUTY & THE BEAST.  Chase scenes:  a couple of good ones, including one featuring a collapsing dam.  Pretty scenery:  yep.  This movie has it all.<br /><br />There are minor problems here and there.  A king and queen who never speak for some reason.  Flynn looks vaguely generic (he's a fun character, though).  But really, the film delivered all I could hope for.  See it...and don't just drag the kids; bring the adults too!</p></br><a href="../users/A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8.html">A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8</a><br/><p>This animation is so well made! All characters were done great, well developed and some were very charming. The plot of the story is interesting and reminded me of some other fairy tales. Voice acting is really good and witty humor in some places just makes the story and characters look even better. The soundtrack is just fine and the animation is not short in duration, which I liked and was right for the animation. It isn't too short and isn't too long. However, I would still probably enjoy it if the animation was even longer in time. The story goes in depth and is really interesting. The created world is also very beautiful. I didn't make the wrong choice and was pleasantly surprised by how well everything was created. This is the animation that must stand among my favorite animations on my shelf. And it is for any ages, kids or adults.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DDPQ9342UNMY.html">A3DDPQ9342UNMY</a><br/><p>TANGLED is much more than "a drop of golden sun." It has a flippant, modern attitude in all of the dialog, a crisply appealing and smartly styled animated technique that brings the characters to life, and a pleasant score by Alan Menken that captures the essence of the fairy tale story in street smart style. In short, it's an instant classic for today's movie fans.<br /><br />With talented voice chores performed by ZACHARY LEVI, MANDY MOORE and DONNA MURPHY, the characters are given full-bodied images that are uncannily real. In fact, the chemistry between Flynn Rider (Levi) and Rapunzel (Moore) is a gradual thing (not instant falling in love as in most Disney features), and blends and ripens convincingly for the tender moments that follow.<br /><br />And aside from the key human characters and a horse named Maximus, there's plenty of fast-moving adventure as the evil Mother Gothel plans on keeping Rapunzel at her side forever as a way to retain the magic powers of her golden hair, lest she shrivel away to an old hag. And within the texture of the plot is always a sense of humor from either one-liner wisecracks or the animated expressions of the humans and Maximus, the stubborn horse.<br /><br />Easily one of the best animated features to come out of the Disney studio in some time despite the fact that the score is not as strong as other animated classics. Nevertheless, it has action and romance and an astounding beauty in its magnificent settings and polished art work.<br /><br />Absolutely a must for any animation fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A4SY5RCGC5CH9.html">A4SY5RCGC5CH9</a><br/><p>Finally! Disney is back with a vengeance... eh, I mean, a princess! This is the great come back of Walt Disney Animation Studios to the classical fairy tales, which made the happiness of so many children since "White Snow" sang that first song... My daughter absolutely loved "Tangled" and I liked it at least as much, for all the reasons mentioned in the title:<br /><br />1. Princess Rapunzel - together with "The Princess and the Frog" in 2009, this is the return of Disney Princesses after a long leave of absence, and Rapunzel is certainly a great success. Her magic hair gives of course a great show but Rapunzel herself is the real star. Having spend all her life in a tower she is quite naive and can even seem simple, but her charm and courage are simply irresistible. The scene in which she handles alone a whole tavern full of mercenaries, rogues, brigands and other scum of the earth is a great moment of cinema!<br /><br />2. Flynn Rider, the thief - he is an extremely likable scoundrel, a perfect mix of Errol Flynn's Robin Hood and Douglas Fairbanks Jr Thief of Baghdad, with just a little something of Han Solo and Captain Jack Sparrow (just younger than both of them). It can seem an unlikely choice to make a thief in the hero of a child story, but Flynn Rider is hardly a real criminal, more like a wannabee - and for all his past misdeeds he is going to be seriously punished in this movie and will have ample occasion to redeem himself... He is also certainly a irresistibly charming character.<br /><br />3. Humor - well, other than Rapunzel's pet chameleon who loves stick his tongue in people's ears, humor is provided by shovels in almost every scene and by almost every character in the movie - but mostly by the brilliant dialogs between Rapunzel and Flynn. Grown ups will find this movie almost certainly as entertaining as children. And mind this frying pan!<br /><br />4. Horse power - I kept the best for the end. Maximus the horse is absolutely the greatest character in the whole movie! As promised on the poster this is a noble steed who can do everything, including sword fighting! In fact the more we progress through the movie, the more we realize that Maximus is in fact.. but no! I am not telling you anything more about him! If you missed this movie in the cinema, you deserve to discover everything about Maximus the horse by yourself!<br /><br />To conclude, this movie is a wonder! Great job Walt Disney Animation Studios and let's hope that their next movies will keep the same quality level!</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>Tangled (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo) being Disney's 50th animated movie is a movie about Rapunzel who has spent all her life locked in a tower. One day an intruder enters her "world" and the adventure begins. The music is amazing and the animation likewise. A movie worthy of Disney and a true gem for children and animated movie fans alike. I loved it. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>I saw this movie during Christmas holidays.  It was my first time to spend holiday with young children around.  Family had to pick a movie that will be fun, entertaining and engaging.  I was dreading the thought of having to watch another "sing and dance" movie with endless catchy songs.<br /><br />This film turned out to be fun.  It has lovely story line from one of the fairy tales and plenty of action.  It is great for both boys and girls.  Adults will not be left behind, they will enjoy this film just as much.</p></br><a href="../users/A25UZ7MA72SMKM.html">A25UZ7MA72SMKM</a><br/><p>Tangled is of course a considerably embellished and altered version of the Rapunzel tale. The story has its ups and down, and is pretty simple overall, without quite as many twists and turns as even films like "The Little Mermaid". However, it does have enough body in the plot to interest viewers young and old. It also has both dramatic and humorous sections.<br /><br />Mandy Moore is quite believable as the voice of Rapunzel, and Zacary Levi (Chuck) does a wonderful job as the rogue she becomes involved with. A tavern scene provides wonderful short performances by the likes of Brad Garret and Ron Perlman. Max the animated horse almost steals the show.<br /><br />However, the real achievement of this movie is the gorgeous animation. Scenery is detailed and better than realistic. Faces are emotional and expressive. Action sequences are fluid and exciting, if of course entirely unbelievable. The imagination of the writers and animators was functioning at a very high level in this film. The floating lantern sequence is a truly unique and spectacular piece of film-making that should not be missed. Sequences involving the sun-flower and its latent effects are beautiful.<br /><br />Criticisms that the film sends the wrong message to youngsters concerning Rapunzel's desire to find freedom from her "fake mother" are ill thought and completely unfounded. She never desired to "rebel" and "seek freedom". Something was obviously wrong in the relationship and she could feel that. Being locked up alone for her entire life was a situation it was only natural to wish to correct.<br /><br />This is a fine entry in the history of Disney animated films, and deserves a high placement in that list.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>The songs are good, the singing is top-notch, the humor is plentiful, and the story has an underlying sweetness to it that is simply enchanting.<br /><br />You don't have to be a nine year old girl to love this movie.  The forty-four year-old me was completely delighted by this film and I look forward to watching it many times over.<br /><br />The movie is available in various digital media formats and with various bonus features depending on your purchase choice.  But all of that is secondary --  if it isn't a good movie, ultimately the bonus features are empty and don't matter.  "Tangled" IS a good movie and worthy of adding to your library.  Young and old will both find it charming, funny, and delightful.<br /><br />As a fan of all things Broadway, I was extra pleased to hear that Broadway veteran Donna Murphy was featured in this.  She is a great actress with a tremendous singing voice.  She brings a lot to her villainous role in "Tangled" and lends the requisite amount of dramatic weight to the proceedings.<br /><br />This movie ain't just for kids, folks.</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>First of all let me say the movie is pleasant and entertaining and one the kids will undoubtedly enjoy. All of the classic Disney elements are there, the lovely heroine, the awkward hero, the loveable sidekick, the fearful villain, and a sympathetic chorus of unlikely defenders. Disney re-mixes these familiar elements into a new concoction based on the Grimm's fairy tale of Rapunzel.<br /><br />There is nice music and singing and plenty of humorous situations to delight the young and the young at heart. Disney has decided to update the dialogue to reflect current phrases and words that are very contemporary and up-to-date. While this may be engaging to the younger audience it imposes a timeframe which will date it before too long as language usage changes quickly.<br /><br />If you have youngsters in the house this will be a winner.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>Tangled has probably received more popular attention than any other Disney animated feature since Lion King. It is quite entertaining and has some funny scenes. The film has a few running jokes, such as the use of a frying pan as a weapon and the intelligent horse Maximus. The animation is definitely a huge step above the traditional Disney animations and Rapunzel really looks beautiful. Unfortunately, I took off one star because the plot isn't really anything to write home about and is pretty predictable. It seems Disney put its effort into the characters and animation rather than try to develop an original story. Still, the movie's entertaining enough that you'll almost forget how banal the plot is. Overall, 4 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>Based on the mythological Rapunzel tales which go back even further to the Maiden in the Tower tales (dealing with isolation, emotional captivity and coming of age).  It's an updated version as a fantasy animation comedy/musical with a roguish hero, a spunky heroine and some basic themes about joy and living your dream.  Mandy Moore is the acting and singing voice of Rapunzel and the whole cast is good (even the minor cast) but in some scenes it seems like the evil witch steals many of the scenes with her underhanded psychological abusive attacks on her fake daughter<br />intertwined with a bit of defensive love. The ending would be a bit of a cheat in an adult tale but as this was intended more for kids it works out well enough and nobody becomes traumatized as a result. Heh. Disney fans will appreciate this being its 50th animation. People who want to do more research about this particular mythology can start at Wikipedia and find it at many other online sources. Interesting take on the hair that I've never read about but it wouldn't surprise me if it was in one of the old folk tales. STORY/PLOTTING: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; CGI: B to B plus; GAGS/HUMOR: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: mid August 2011 (streamed); OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>The 50th animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, "Tangled" is a little less flashy and a little less hectic than the average animated feature these days, hewing closer to "reality" than most such films - if one can stretch that term to include a tale of a beautiful, tower-dwelling princess whose blonde tresses glow when she sings, and whose "Prince Charming" comes in the form of a roguish thief whose face is plastered on wanted posters all over the countryside.  But "Tangled" doesn't overplay its hand in the storytelling arena.  There are no fire-breathing dragons, no talking animals, no over-extended action sequences (or at least no more than necessary).  The focus is mainly on two attractive and likable characters coming to know and accept one another throughout the course of their adventures.<br /><br />The adventure begins when Rapunzel (Mandy Moore), who has just turned eighteen, decides she wants to leave the castle in which she's been locked away by an old crone posing as her mother - it turns out Rapunzel's hair confers eternal youth on anyone who touches it - in order to experience what life is like in the outside world.  Rapunzel finally gets her wish when the thief, Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) - who's fleeing the law and the two cohorts he's just betrayed - attempts to hide in her tower, which he assumes is empty.  However, he gets more than he bargained for when he meets this na?ve but feisty young woman who sees him as the opportunity for escape she's been pining for all these years.  So off they go to see the world, with many an unexpected adventure awaiting them along the way.<br /><br />"Tangled" is a little more deliberately paced than the typical kids' flick - indeed it takes a full half-hour before we even get outside the tower room - and the scenes run a little longer than usual, as Rapunzel and Flynn take the time to establish a relationship of mutual respect and trust.  The humor is gentle and the tone sweet, yet there is just the right amount of starch in the characters of the crone (nicely voiced by Donna Murphy) and Flynn's aggrieved criminal cohorts to keep things from getting too sappy.  The soft-focus backgrounds provide an appropriately comfy setting for the tale, and the musical numbers (by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater) have an appealing Broadway show-tune brassiness to them that lifts the audience's spirits.<br /><br />As written by Dan Fogelman and directed by Nathan Greno and Byron Howard, "Tangled" doesn't come sailing out of the wings, as so many similar recent films have done, trying to impress us with its postmodern revisionism and cynical self-awareness.  It tweaks some of the elements of the classic Fairy Tale genre to be sure, but it also acknowledges and respects those elements.  It really isn't in the business of tearing things down just so it can congratulate itself on its own iconoclasm and irreverence.  And I, for one, am tremendously grateful for that.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>A very family friendly movie that is not only funny, but a great story as well. Loosely based on the story of Rapunzel, it stays a lighthearted adventure that doesn't insult anyone. Disney is very much on track these days putting out the types of movies we all enjoyed in the past that you could take the family to see and not worry about obnoxious characters that set bad examples. My wife and I enjoyed it and agreed to get it for the children, and the grandchildren to enjoy. If you like the classic Disney movies you will probably enjoy it.<br /><br />Spoiler alert:<br />Rapunzel is kidnapped and kept in a tower so that she may keep an evil woman young with her magic hair. When a thief climbs into her tower trying to escape the law he learns it is not wise to enter without announcing themself. Rapunzel strikes a bargain with the thief to escape the tower and see the town. As the thief avoids the law he does his best to show Rapuzel what she has missed locked away in the tower. All good fun as they are chased and make new friends and become close to each other.

Or, at least, that's what I'm rediscovering now that my girls are getting at the age of watching a film all the way through. While "Tangled" doesn't surpass "Toy Story 3," it comes in a close second. Especially among the animated fare this year. Super-cute Repunzel is a welcome princess to join the ranks of Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Belle, Ariel, Tiana, Jasmine, Mulan and Pocahontas (can't you tell I have two young daughters?). There's plenty of romance for the girls, action for the boys and laughs for everyone! The music is OK (not as good as "Princess and the Frog"), but the film itself has a lot of heart. Also, Donna Murphy (who some might remember as the wife of Dr. Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina) in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMQW">Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)</a>) is excellent as the newest villain, Mother Gothel. I did see this in 3-D (which I'm not too crazy about) and it was great, especially with my daughter reaching out for the floating lanterns. If you don't have kids, this movie could probably wait -- even though it's still enjoyable. But, if you have a kid, this movie is essential viewing ... and you won't be rolling your eyes and constantly checking your watch to see when it ends. That, in of itself, is a compliment to Disney animation and story!</p></br><a href="../users/A3FDEI5P21XX6S.html">A3FDEI5P21XX6S</a><br/><p>A fun film that has entertained both my family and customers of all ages passing through my store. The Disney BD did not disappoint on quality and value for the price, albeit several features are worth skipping.<br /><br />The picture quality is as expected - virtually flawless and very colorful. The 7.1 DTS is great, though most of the outer channel usage was with Maximus and the dam breaking, still worthwhile to have the extra two speakers going though. The supplements are a mixed bag and include:<br /><br />* Deleted scenes, 3 @ 12:36 minutes. Directors intro for each, all still in the sketch mode. Nothing worth watching unless you like the rough draft edits.<br />* Original Storybook Openings, 2 versions @ 8 minutes. Both with intros, and both providing only a couple tidbits of additional details.<br />* 50th Feature Countdown, 2 minutes. Way too fast as they show a brief clip from each film accompanied by a number but no titles. Even pausing each one for customers to guess was not enough - too quick and not enough info.<br />* Extended Song Sequences, 2 @ 7:48 minutes. The "Life Begin" and "Mother Knows Best" songs, mixed in with sketch and CGI animation to show the extensions, glad they were cut down.<br />* Untangled, making of, 12:27 minutes. Hosted by Mandy Moore and Zach Levi. Shows some decent background on the production process mixed in with trivia and lots of cheese by those two as they try to provide some painful laughs. Not sure what the target audience was as I liked some of the information (that might bore kids) but their comedy attempts were horrible.<br />* Tangled Teasers, 9 totaling 10 minutes. Each is an animated minute of almost South Park-themed skits. One was an obvious take on a certain prescription medication that helps men. Wish I could say why these were even included...kids will miss some of the humor.<br />* The Disney 3D intro with the Lion King critters - old.<br />* The Disney intro to Digital Copy.<br />* Info: The pointless paragraph about commentaries.<br />* Disc 2 is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004G600A4">Tangled</a> DVD.<br /><br />French and Spanish soundtracks with English 2.0 Descriptive Service and subs in same. I enjoyed the movie and BD quality, but the extras are almost bizarre in both production and/or why they were included. Still have to give it a 5-star review for overall worth with the DVD and Solid BD specs. Region coded A/B/C.<br /><br />EDIT: Forgot to mention that the opening of the BD has a VERY small menu along the bottom that you have only a few seconds to select that allows you to bypass the hideous amounts of Disney material/trailers/promos. It goes by fast but it is sooooo worth it - I was giving this a 5-star before even seeing the rest just for that. The catch is you have to scroll through several options to get to PLAY MOVIE and it goes to the trailers if you have not hit enter before it transitions.</p></br><a href="../users/A11C43I615R52G.html">A11C43I615R52G</a><br/><p>Since John Lasseter took over Walt Disney Animation Studios, a trend of quality has been noted in the features released since his commanding. Disney Animation Studios has a rich history and was one of the best (if not the best studio) in the animtion field. But since the 2000s, the studio became less and less succesful with awful movies that not only did not resonate with audiences but also were box office bombs. Since Lasseter took over the studio, only four films (Meet the Robinsons, Bolt, The Princess and the Frog and Tangled)had been released but each one of them are compelling and have pushed the studio up again. Following the phenomenal The Princess and the Frog (which also set the return of glourious hand-drawn animation into the studio), Tangled became Disney's 50th Animated film and I'm happy to report that is a sensational film that proudly fits that milestone.<br /><br />Struggling almost 8 years in production and costing over $260 million, Tangled had a very troubled production. Formerly knwon as Rapunzel, the title was changed in order to appeal to boys and to draw more money from the box office. While the title change is somewhat a debatable decision, it seems it worked because Tangled became a major box office success earning almost $600 million in receipts. Although the title was changed and the trailers showed a "contemporary" story, make no mistake: Tangled is a tradional musical fairy tale and is a really good one.<br /><br />I won't tell the plot here but let me tell you that the movie has a lot going for it: a compelling and likeable heroine, a brave and funny hero, adorable animal sideckicks and a memorable villain. Rapunzel is a very strong, free-spirited young woman who is easy to root for, the same can be said for Flynn Ryder the thief with a heart of gold. Pascal the chameleon and Maximus the horse are really funny and Mother Gothel is a very amusing villain. The animators and the voice actors have to be credited for doing such roundable palpable characters.<br /><br />The animation is simply amazing!!! It's the first time that a CGI Disney film can be up there with the Pixar catalogue. The humans are rendered marvelousy and the sceneries are breathtaking (specially the lantern sequence). But what struck me the most was how amazing Rapunzel's hair is. Is so beautiful and believable that really adds to the picture value.<br /><br />The score and the songs were done by legend composer Alan Menken and his new lyricist Glenn Slater. While the songs are good and serve their purpose in the film, they are far from memorable. They are not the best Menken has done and they are not at the same level as others like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast or Aladdin. Still the ones that I really like were "When will my Life Begin?", its reprise and of course the Oscar nominated "I see the Light" (which should've won the Oscar).<br /><br />Wrapping up, Tangled is an excellent film with outstanding animation, great characters and nice songs. An excellent Disney film.<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br /><br />Unsurprisingly by now, Tangled BD looks absolutely spectacualar. A lot of things can be said about the transfer but let me tell you that this disc is demo quality and will completely blew your mind. The same can be said for the 7.1 DTS-HD MA track which is dynamic, clear and potent.<br /><br />The DVD also boasts a fairly impressive transfer for SD and a good 5.1 Dolby Audio.<br /><br />Bonus Material:<br /><br />You have some deleted scenes, two storybooks openings, a 50th animated countdown (which is great), a making-of featurette, two extended songs and 9 teasers.<br /><br />While all the material is great, the making-of featurette feels really promotional and too short to be entirely valuable. I was hoping for a more compelling documentary that will talk about the music in the film, the anination and the production overall. Overall they are entertaining pieces but Disney could've done a lot more in the special features department.<br /><br />Sneek Peeks:<br /><br />You got some interesting Sneek peeks like:<br /><br />The Lion King: Diamond Edition (Coming this fall!!!)<br />Winnie the Pooh (in theaters July 15, same day as Harry Potter)<br />Cars 2 (in theaters June 24)<br />Dumbo: 70th Anniversary (not release date but is definetely coming this year)<br />The Incredibles on BD (already released)<br /><br />And more that for me are not worth mentioning. Also is worth noting that in an insert that came in the box, The Fox and the Hound: 30th Anniversary Edition and TFATH2 are also listed in a 2-movie collection 3-disc combo pack which will include a BD and a DVD for the original film and one DVD for the cheapquel. This set is going to be released this September.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />Tangled is another example that Disney is recapturing its magic again and delivering good quality animated films. With stunning video and excellent audio and a good (if lacking) assortment of bonus features, Tangled is a must-own title on BD. This set is great for the majority of us who won't buy 3D crap and doesn't care for digital copies. Tangled on BD comes highly recommended!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>Enjoyable, vibrant and all-out fun, "Tangled" is another wonderful animated film from Disney!<br /><br />In 2010, the 50th Walt Disney Animated Classic was released!  Based on the fairy tale "Rapunzel" by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, the film adaptation is directed by Nathan Greno ("Bolt", "Meet the Robinsons", "Chicken Little", "Mulan") with Byron Howard ("Chicken Little", "Brotehr Bear", "Lilo & Stitch", "Mulan", "Pocahontas") and a screenplay by Dan Fogelman ("Bolt", "Cars", "Fred Claus").<br /><br />"Tangled" would feature the voices of Mandy Moore ("A Walk to Remember", "Saved", "The Princess Diaries"), Zachary Levi ("Chuck", "Less Than Perfect", "Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakuel"), Donna Murphy ("The Fountain", "Spider-Man 2', "Trust Me"), Ron Perlman ("Hellboy" films, "Sons of Anarchy", "Chronus"), M.C. Gainey ("Beerfest", "Sideways", "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"), Jeffrey Tambor ("The Hangover", "Arrested Development", "The Larry Sanders Show") and Brad Garrett ("Everybody Loves Raymond", "`Til Death", "Ratatouille").<br /><br />The film was a success in the box office as the $260 million film would make over $551 million worldwide and has received mostly positive reviews from film critics.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />"Tangled" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 Aspect Ratio) and I don't think anyone has found anything negative to say about a modern Disney animated film on Blu-ray and the same can be said for "Tangled".  Immediately when you start watching "Tangled", you are greeted with vibrant colors, black levels are nice and fine detail crammed into every frame.  From the detail on the trees, to the detail of Rapunzel's hair, watching the folds on the clothing of the characters to the details of the Tower, the greenery..."Tangled" features colors and detail galore.<br /><br />If there was one scene that really caught my eyes was during the chase scene (which applies to audio as well).  The way the mountains look, the way the water looks, even down to the grain of the wood, "Tangled" looked absolutely fantastic.  I was very impressed by the animation for this film.<br /><br />I detected no artifacting, digital noise, edge enhancement but I did detect slight banding in two spots.  One where both Flynn and Rapunzel were sitting near a camp fire and another scene with a lot of red.  It was noticeable but aside from those short moments, I detected nothing that would have spoiled the film.<br /><br />Personally, for the majority of the film, "Tangled" was a visual feast and I was quite impressed by how detailed the film was but also how much went into the physics for Rapunzel's hair.  Overall, awesome PQ!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />"Tangled" is presented in English 7.1 DTS Master Audio, French  Spanish 7.1 DTS-HD NR and English 2.0 DVS.  While not as strong as other Disney action-based films, still "Tangled" is no slouch as you can hear the wind, plants rustling, the stomping of the hooves of Maximus, the arrows being shot by the guards who are trying to get Flynn Rider and the bumps and slams into Flynn Rider's noggin from the pan used by Rapunzel.<br /><br />But possibly the best segment where LFE, surround and rear-surround channels come into play is the chase scene when the guards and Maximus are going after Flynn and Rapunzel.  That was quite impressive audio-wise!<br /><br />So, there are many moments of immersive audio that you can hear from the surround channels but because this is not an all-action film, one can expect crisp dialogue through the center channels and the score by Alan Menken as well as the music from "Tangled" through the front channels but also at times utilizing the surround and rear-surround channels.<br /><br />The lossless soundtrack is quite appropriate for a film like "Tangled" and I don't think anyone can be disappointed by it.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"Tangled" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  * Deleted Scenes - (12:36) Featuring three deleted scenes: The Jaunty Moose, Chemistry Develops and Vigor the Visionary featuring intros by directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard on why the scenes were cut.  Note: Scenes are sketches and not 3D rendered.<br />  * Original Storybook Opening - Originally, the film would feature a storybook opening but the directors felt they wanted to do something different.  So, included are the the two storybook openings version 1 (3:57) and version 2 (4:02).<br />  * 50th Animated Feature Countdown - (2:03) A countdown featuring clips of all 50 Disney Animated films.<br />  * Extended Songs - Featuring the extended songs "When Will My Life Begin" (3:35) and "Mother Knows Best" (4:12) with intro by directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard.<br />  * Untangled - The Making of a Fairy Tale - (12:28) Featuring the making of "Tangled" hosted by Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi.<br />  * Tangled Teasers - (9:12) Featuring nine animated teasers for "Tangled".<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />"Tangled" comes with a slip-over cardboard case.  The accompanying DVD is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1), English & Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and English 2.0 DVS with subtitles in English SDH and French Subtitles.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />This is an update to my previous review as I decided that I had to watch this film again as the first time, I felt I was concentrating too much on the visuals but this time around, I wanted to embrace the musical side to the film as well and I'm glad I did!<br /><br />Not only did I enjoy it much more the second time, I just realized how awesome this Blu-ray release is by just really focusing on the lossless soundtrack and just finding that right position where the sound effects, especially the music just came alive.<br /><br />"Tangled" turned out to be a wonderful, delightful animated film by Disney and a wonderful experience that had that romantic comedy but yet darker and magical feel such as "The Little Mermaid" and even "Snow White".<br /><br />And as mentioned earlier in my review, this is a wonderful Disney film that wasn't made by Pixar and perhaps that is a good thing because Disney animated classics have built themselves upon fantasy and adventure and what best to have their 50th animated film to carry on the tradition that Walt Disney had done long ago for his films and that is to have a film that can entertain people of all ages but to also to have elements based on a well-written script.<br /><br />Sure, John Lasseter may have had his hand in this film as an executive producer but you have to give credit to directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard, especially screenwriter Dan Fogelman for taking on a well-known fairy tale and making an enjoyable film out of it.  Personally, I felt that the creators and staff were able to create a fresh and innovative storyline based on the fairy tale of "Rapunzel" but not make it so kitschy and keeping it fun, humorous and even heartfelt.<br /><br />While a few may have felt that it was wrong for Disney to use the title of "Rapunzel" and go with the title of "Tangled", I can understand why they did it.  With "The Princess and the Frog", many felt the film did skew towards a younger female demographic and "Rapunzel" would have probably done the same.  Enough of the foolishness of even debating about the name, focus on the film and you realize how fantastic of an animated film "Tangled" truly is.<br /><br />This time, you have Rapunzel and the swashbuckling thief, Flynn Rider and you have a film that the boys and girls will love, but throw in a few deeper and slightly darker elements to make the film rated PG and you have all the ingredients to make a wonderful animated film.<br /><br />The voice acting for the film was wonderful.  Both Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi have wonderful chemistry ala voice acting and for the most part, the characters and the talented hired for the film were well-cast by Disney.  I'm not sure who did the singing voice for Rapunzel (as I know Mandy Moore can sing) and even for Flynn (can Zachary Levi sing?), but will say that I was quite pleased with both talent's voice acting performance.<br /><br />The musical score by Alan Menken was actually quite memorable and like he has done for animated films like "Beauty and the Beast", "The Little Mermaid" and "Aladdin", the music is quite strong.  The musical numbers for "Tangled" are catchy and fun but while the music and the songs really provided a wonderful backdrop to the awesome visuals.  At first, I felt that I was unfair to the music as I kept complimenting the visuals but the second time around, I made it priority to listen to the music and I found myself absolutely loving it.  Menken really created music that complimented the film and once again, he has done a fabulous job.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, "Tangled" looks absolutely beautiful on Blu-ray and the music and lossless audio soundtrack is wonderful and works for this type of film.  While there are a good amount of special features with this release, I have to admit that I was a bit surprised as I was expecting a whole lot more (as Disney tends to spoil you with a lot of special features) for "Tangled".  But still, that's after years of being spoiled by Blu-ray releases from Disney but for what was included, there are still a good number of special features to keep viewers busy.<br /><br />Overall, "Tangled" is a delightful film that will entertain families although because it's rated PG and does nearly show a death scene, it was a necessary move by Disney that made the film work.  The film still manages to display the magic of Walt Disney through it's look and feel and also continuing the tradition of quality with its Blu-ray releases as "Tangled" simply looks beautiful and sounds great via HD.<br /><br />While not as special features heavy as I would have hoped (and expected) to see from a Walt Disney film, "Tangled" is still an enjoyable and wonderful film for the entire family and I definitely recommend it!</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>I don't like animation movie much. I've watched approximately 20 of them such as Snow White, Wall-e, Lion King, Finding Nemo, Mulan, Dumbo, etc. Tangled is the only one that I bought a copy of its DVD because I love it so much. The reasons why are listed below.<br /><br />- The face movements of the main characters such as the horse and Flynn and are lively and so human-like that they captivate me. For example when the horse was angry with Flynn, it frowned its face just like a man! It's hilarious and fascinating. Or when Flynn tried to convince Rapunzel to give him back the the tiara, he raised one of his eybrows and half-closed his eyes. The facial expression was just like that of a man who's trying to come up with a trick.<br /><br />- There are a lot of humour.<br /><br />- Most of the time, the color are bright and beautiful. It does birghten up my mood.<br /><br />- The animals do not speak human language. This feature makes this film more suitable for adults like me.<br /><br />- There are two scenes that touch my heart the most. The first is when Flynn rather faced death than let Rapunzel endanger herself by healing his mortal wound. The second is the reunion of Rapunzel and her parents.<br /><br />It's the only animation movie that I've bought so far. It's one of my 3 best love-story movies. The others are: Ghost (Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg),  and Just Like Heaven (Reese Witherspoon, Mark Ruffalo).</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>Note: A friend of mine got the movie for me as a bootleg copy 1 day after it came out on DVD (though I was expecting the actual DVD).<br /><br />Disney has not lost its magic touch. They've been making quality, family-friendly movies since 1937 and still going strong. View it in 3-D. It's so worth it.<br /><br />The movie begins with a clip of Mickey Mouse in "Steamboat Willie" then the camera pans back to show Mickey in the 0 for "Walt Disney's 50th Animated Feature." Very good reference to the past.<br /><br />The story is based on the fairy tale "Rapunzel" by the Brothers Grimm, and the film was originally titled "Rapunzel" but changed by the studio to lure boys in. Not a bad move, marketing-wise, but Disney should have kept the original title.<br /><br />Biblically-speaking, there is no swearing or sex (it's A DISNEY movie, people!! What would you expect other than singing, dancing, good old-fashioned fun and clean humor?). There is some mild violence, but it's handled discreetly, and it's usually comic (though there are some frightening scenes for little ones). ***BEGIN SPOILER*** One scene towards the end is adapted straight from the fairy tale, in which Rapunzel heals the Prince through her tears and his sight is restored (after he's blinded by falling into thorn bushes while jumping from the tower in rage at not finding Rapunzel there). Obviously, Disney changed it a bit to make it more family-friendly, but still, parents should still be there to reassure their little ones, AND never does the movie pretend to be anything more than a fairy tale (ie. "The Little Mermaid," "Aladdin," "Beauty And The Beast," etc).<br />***END SPOILER***<br /><br />Alan Menken, the Academy Award winning composer of "The Little Mermaid," "Aladdin" and "Beauty And The Beast," wrote the songs for the film. My personal favourite song is "I See The Light"; a very heartwarming and romantic ballad that conjures up the ballroom scene from "Beauty And The Beast." All the songs, though, are equally enchanting and fun. Pascal reminds me of a certain Caribbean crab. This film is reminiscent of the Disney films we know and love. I highly recommend it; the perfect film either for a date night, a family movie night or just for your own  entertainment. The casting and production values are simply amazing, just what you would expect from a top-notch Disney production. The soundtrack is also Tangamazing. Rated PG for mild violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WZ1B92F81LJJ.html">A2WZ1B92F81LJJ</a><br/><p>Disney looks like it's going to have a great year. With the eye-popping TRON: Legacy recently unleashed on cinemas, its follow up is the equally impressive, though decidedly more traditional Disney fare of Tangled, a clever reworking of the Rapunzel fairy story.<br /><br />Both are supposed to be amongst the most expensive movies ever made. That's a pretty big punt for one studio in the austere times of 2010.<br /><br />But then, when you celebrate, you should do it in style. As the opening titles roll, Disney announces that Tangled is its 50th feature length animation, and in that spirit I suppose it has tried to throw in something for everyone, and impressively, has succeeded. There's the princess in the tower, musical numbers, a Robin Hood- like rascally hero, and a wide cast of hilarious bit parts including a gang of villainous but kind-hearted ruffians and what has to be the most scene-stealing horse in motion picture history.<br /><br />Tangled certainly passed the real acid test: I went armed with two sceptical boys (who professed they'd rather watch TRON: Legacy) and a highly enthusiastic five year old girl, who wanted nothing more than to see a beautiful princess, and all of them came out fizzing.<br /><br />It's interesting where this places Disney. In the same month that Disney demonstrates with TRON its technical credentials and, perhaps, how far In George Lucas' direction it is prepared to stray from its original mandate, it also shows a marked return to its most classic era - something that has been a deliberate strategy for the company over the last couple of years. For Tangled is fundamentally, an innocent, fun tale. It harks back to Disney's heyday: It is populated by a tried and true Disney archetypes: a classic evil witch of the Cruella de Ville mould, a feisty but fundamentally pre-feminist 18 year-old heroine in Rapunzel herself (in this way contrasting quite markedly with Shrek's Fiona), sidekicks in the form of unlikely but adorable animals, and a cuddly rogues gallery intended only to provide comic relief.<br /><br />And true to this description Tangled is an altogether less knowing, less arch adventure than any of the Pixar outings to date, where you fancy they've targeted the parents and thrown in the odd jokes to keep the kids engaged. Here, this is a kids' movie pure and simple, and is none the worse for it either: as long as you check your cynical fin-du-si&egrave;cle attitude at the door, you'll have a ball.<br /><br />Regular readers will know I'm no great fan of 3D for the sake of it, but here I must say the 3D, and the animation generally, is continually impressive. I find myself rather fatigued by technological advances for the sake of it (well - it's shooting fish in a barrel: after all, there's not much you can't do with enough computer horsepower), but what impresses is the artfulness in which the technology is employed. The sweeping camera angles, clever use of perspective; the beautiful framing of every scene - the musical numbers particularly are brilliantly staged (for me to enjoy them, they'd have to be: I can't stand musicals). A bunch of Pentium processors won't give you that - but it's something Disney has always had a long suit in, and Tangled certainly measures up well against the studio's esteemed standards.<br /><br />In terms of characters, the cast are (to my limited outlook) relative unknowns and perform a workmanlike fashion, and are never allowed get in the way of the animated wizardry (which is how it ought to be in a Disney film). Mandy Moore does a fine job as Rapunzel; Zachary Levy had a little more trouble with Flynn Rider (or perhaps the character was just less appealing) and Donna Murphy seems to have come direct from Central Casting to play the role of Gothel but in any case all, and every other presence on the screen, was blown out of the water by Maximus, a centurion's horse, who was separated from his rider in a chase scene and made the most of his fifteen minutes of fame (they lasted an hour and a half, at any rate!). Somewhat galling, I dare say, for the voice actors to be outdone by an unvoiced animation, and he wasn't even the only one - there's a delightful running gag about a Marcel Marceau mime also!<br /><br />Look, it's not Citizen Kane, but if you're nostalgic for the sorts of films Disney used to make, and you're jaded by the world-weary attitude that seems to infect every "kids" movie in the digitally animated era, this one will be a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />Olly Buxton</p></br><a href="../users/A3QH6BEY6RYQR0.html">A3QH6BEY6RYQR0</a><br/><p>An updated take on the story of Rapunzel. A young queen has been snatched from her crib and held for years by a woman posing as her mother. The young woman is not permitted to venture outside due to the "dangers" that lurk. A young thief who is running from the local authorities finds her, and their journey begins. An enchanting love story that looks great in 3D, this film will be enthralling for all who see it. Alan Menken's music is first-rate, There is humor for all ages, and the development of the relationship between the heroine and the hero will captivate adults. There is a paucity of cute and funny characters, which makes the film appeal to a slightly older audience than the typical Disney fare. This is a welcome addition to the line-up of Disney animated films.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This is a great movie. this movie has everything, drama,  comedy, romance. action. this movie is great i love max. he has to be one of the funniest disney characters i've seen in a long time. this movie great for kids and adults.</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>TANGLED, the latest animated film by those clever Disney folks, is an updated take on the classic tale of Rapunzel.  I had the pleasure of seeing this over Christmas with four kids - 3 girls and a boy, ages 13, 10, 7, and 5 - as well as my still single bother-in-law.  And, everyone in this very diverse group had a wonderful time.<br /><br />TANGLED follows the storyline of the Rapunzel fairy tale, so I won't retell it here.  However, Disney has added humor, music, and enough surprises to turn TANGLED into an delighful, modern story for the 21st century.  Like Tiana from The Princess and The Frog, Rapunzel is not your typical, faint of heart princess; when an intruder breaches her tower, she handily whacks him with a cast iron skillet and makes him her prisoner.  She boldly goes after her destiny and discovers who she really is.  As much as I like Cinderella, Snow White, and Aurora, these new Disney princesses go after what they want, work hard, and, (with help from friends) succeed.  And along the way, they and the "prince" end up helping each other.  These are the role models I want for my kids!<br /><br />The animation in TANGLED is gorgeous, the music (Alan Menken!!!) is outstanding and catchy, and the voice acting is excellent.  Mandy Moore is on point as the spunky, strong willed Rapunzel, and she sings beautifully as well.  Donna Murphy (as the wicked witch) and Zachary Levi (as the roguish intruder) both turn in fine voice and singing performances as well.  The animal characters, Maximus, the intrepid war horse, and Pascal, the Jiminy Cricket-like chameleon, don't talk (for once!), but they convey more in expressions and actions than many human characters.  A lot of the LOL funny moments (and there are MANY in TANGLED) occur with these two, and they alone are worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Overall, TANGLED is charming, entertaining, and funny - a treat for the entire family.  And I really love these 21st century Disney princesses; they are strong, independent, hardworking, kind, and loving.  Exactly the kind of young women that I hope for my daughters to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A8S11VP9Z36D6.html">A8S11VP9Z36D6</a><br/><p>I was really surprised by "Tangled." It is everything i had hoped <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034JKZ3G">The Princess and The Frog</a> would be. Sure, I loved "Princess And The Frog," but "Tangled" is close to perfection in all the major ways: characterization, story, style, and even song. Although I question all the brouhaha about renaming "Rapunzel" so that the male audience wouldn't get turned off by another Princess movie, I fully support the final product! The movie is current yet classic; edgy yet traditional; in short...great Disney entertainment.<br /><br />Flynn Rider is one of the first truly dimensional male leads in a Disney film in years; Zachary Levi does a great job of voicing a character who is more than just a handsome piece of cardboard. Mandy Moore is more than able as the voice for the lead, giving Rapunzel plenty of gumption and a thirst for life after having been couped up in the tower for so long. Although I LOVED the movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049GYXCC">Enchanted</a>, I was less than thrilled with Susan Sarandon's villainess. She almost seemed to walk through the role, lacking the proper subtle menace needed to really create a dark and scary character capable of doing evil deeds. Not a problem here though; Donna Murphy makes Mother Gothel, the evil woman who stole Rapunzel from her royal parents at birth, one of the scariest (albeit subtly) Disney villainesses in a long time. When she tells Rapnzel not to ask her about leaving the tower again, you know she means it!<br /><br />The story is familiar, but here goes a Reader's Digest version: Mother Gothel steals Rapunzel as a baby so that her magical hair will keep her (Mother Gothel) eternally young. To ensure Rapunzel doesn't get wise to the theft, she poses as Rapunzel's mother and locks the young girl away in a secluded tower, constantly warning her that the outside world is evil. As fate would have it, a handsome Robin Hood-esque young man named Flynn Rider is attempting to escape the guards at the Royal Palace, and naturally happens upon Rapunzel's tower while Gothel is gone. Rapunzel sees Flynn as her ticket for a quick escape to see the wonders of the world without Gothel knowing. It should come as no surprise that the best laid plans go awry, and Rapunzel ends up getting much more than she bargained for, with Gothel hot on her trail, desperate to recapture  her fading youth.<br /><br />So why 4 stars instead of 5? First, the picture is perfect. You can practically count the hairs on Rapunzel's head. The beautiful lighting and shading from the Disney Animation Team is shown to its full advantage. And as for the sound...awesome as well! The music surrounds you and you'll be singing the memorable music ("Mother Knows Best" and "When Will My Life Begin") right along with the movie. Obviously, my slight beef is not with the music. Instead, it's with the features. It seems obvious that this set is aimed towards the regular (and possibly more youthful) viewer as opposed to the animation-junkie who wants to see the behind-the-scenes documentaries, intense storyboard sessions, and other rare material that would satisfy the deep cravings of a Disneyphile. Instead, there are hip and comical features that are more fun than informative.<br /><br />Here's what you get:<br /><br />-Untangled: The Making of a Fairy Tale: Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi host this featurette that is more trivia-based than anything very serious or scholarly. Again, definitely aimed at the younger set and those who just want to be entertained. For me, the most interesting part was seeing how the hair of Rapunzel was actually animated. Wow...what a challenge to make it look natural.<br /><br />-Deleted Scenes: Co-directors Byron Howard & Nathan Greco introduce 3 scenes ("The Jaunty Moose," "Chemistry Develops," and "Vigor The Visionary") and explain why they were cut. I have to admit I get a little annoyed with the Disney "deleted scene" features on their discs. Most of these haven't even gotten beyond the storyboard point, so I'm not sure they really qualify as "deleted." Instead, these are more like ideas that were explored but never really quite finished. All of them slow down the pace and definitely are not missed. Enjoyable, but not missed.<br /><br />-Two Original Storybook Openings: Alternate versions of the film's opening, again introduced by Byron  & Nathan. This is at least interesting to see how it pays homage to classic Disney animation as well as how it evolved over each attempt.<br /><br />-50th Animated Feature Countdown: Fun, but again...more on the fluffy side is this montage of the 49 Disney animated films that preceded "Tangled."<br /><br />-9 Tangled Teasers: Another fluff piece...entertaining, funny, and witty...but again, fluff. A series of "trailers" that take the form of parodies of infomercials and other current commercials/news bits.<br /><br />And that's it...other than the usual bag of previews/plugs for upcoming Disney releases.<br /><br />Please don't let the 4 stars deter you; this is truly a fantastic Disney animated classic that deserves to stand proudly with its predecessors. CGI detractors: it's just another art tool like a pencil...this film has many stunning moments, especially the scenes with the lanterns (you just have to get it to see!).<br /><br />SPECS: 1.78:1 widescreen/enhanced for 16x9 with 7.1 DTS-HD, 2.0 Dolby Digital DVS for Bluray and 5.1 Dolby Digital, 2.1 Dolby Digital DVS for DVD. Languages are English, French, and Spanish with subtitles English SDH, French, and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CK0VXUDVXGMN.html">A2CK0VXUDVXGMN</a><br/><p>My adult daughter "made" me watch this movie, a take off on the Repunzel fairy tale.  I rolled my eyes, thinking this another Disney clunker, but boy was I surprised.  This was a snappy, fun movie with clever, likeable characters and a fun plot with plenty of action, kind of like Shrek without Shrek.  And, not surprising because it was a Disney film, the animation and computer generated effects, were both beautiful and exciting.  This was a good film that a wimpy ending could not even ruin.  When your daugther asks you to watch it, or any movie for that matter, don't roll your eyes!  Especially about Tangled!</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>OK, it's pretty funny, and Rapunzel's hair is not only beautiful, it is magical. For one thing, it never did get tangled, for all the title suggests. As someone whose hair was nowhere near that long when a week's worth of bed head was bad enough to cut it off, I find it very hard to believe that she was able to keep it so smooth and clean and healthy. Imagine what it must have been like to wash!<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie does not explore these practical matters. What's more, her hair often seems to change in length, which is an inconsistency not common in Disney films. Still, the girl is undeniably pretty, even if she sounds far more 21st century than back in the "once upon a time" days. This is not particularly unusual for Disney princesses, however.<br /><br />Just in case anyone has missed the basic premise, a princess was born with long, magical golden hair. It could cure anything, including injuries and old age. She was therefore kidnapped by an old witch who kept her locked in a tower, claiming to be her mother who was protecting her from the mean old world outside, and using Rapunzel's hair to keep herself young.<br /><br />Rapunzel remembers nothing of her former life consciously, but some of it comes out in her painting, which she does all around the walls and ceiling of her tower chamber. But all she knows of the world outside is what she can see from her window. And one thing she can see is that on her birthday every year, thousands of glowing lights appear in the distance, all different colors and floating on the wind. Her mother says they are stars, bur Rapunzel is smart enough to know that they don't act like the stars do. She does not know it, but her royal parents have made a tradition of setting lamps like tiny hot air balloons adrift on her birthday, in her memory and in the hope that she may see them and know that they are calling to her.<br /><br />Of course there must be a handsome rescuer, but this time it is a thief who has just broken into the palace and stolen the crown which sat on an altar waiting for the return of the golden-haired princess. I doubt that he knows that story, or he would probably have known who Rapunzel was when he met her.<br /><br />In any case, the story is the traditional one with lots of amusing additions, including a little chameleon who is Rapunzel's pet. It's pretty and it's fun, but it's Disney, which means it's a pretty high sugar content for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>There was too much frog and not enough of Disney's First Black Princess in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034JKZ86">The Princess and the Frog (Single-Disc Edition)</a>.  Since Tangled came after The Princess and the Frog, Tangled as a superior product makes it appear as though Disney didn't do their best with The Princess and the Frog.<br /><br />Tangled is satisfying modern successor to the classic Disney Princess animated films and I recommend it without reservation.  Not only does Rapunzel's appearance and situation remind one of the Stolen Children of Poland but also China where the Chinese floating lanterns represent our yearning for our stolen children whom the Japanese chose if they were captured from elite familes (i.e. "princesses") to be sold as gristle for their goblin attempts at boosting Chinese medicines for their own desire for enhanced "vitality," sold at sex auctions to both sadistic Japanese men and women and to be thrown down silver mines in Japan where the American, British and Australian POWs found their corpses lining the tunnels.  Grown men found themselves standing on top of children's bodies just as the recovery workers experienced at the site of the World Trade Center.<br /><br />And if you want to know who the Evil Goth(!)el is modeled after, at least her distinctive TORSO is modeled after Yoko Ono's.

And yet I have to give them credit where credit is due. Disney pretty much holds a lock on naked emotional manipulation through cute anthropomorphic animals (in this case, a chameleon and a horse, who play straight men to the female and male, respectively, romantic leads) and songs that sound like they were written after the consultation of what's-hip trend reports, rather than being from the heart. All of which is a long way of saying that I really liked &lt;em>Tangled&lt;/em>, though I hate myself for really liking it, and I understand all the reasons why I shouldn't like it. But there it is.<br /><br />Plot: loosely based on the Rapunzel fairy tale, so the main character's name, Rapunzel (teen singing sensation Mandy Moore), make perfect sense. As we open, Rapunzel is stolen from the royal crib by an evil old witch, Gothel (&lt;em>Spider-Man 2&lt;/em>'s Donna Murphy), because the royal guard harvested the flower Gothel uses to keep herself young to try and save the queen's baby in the womb. Which worked, obviously, but now the magic of the flower can only be found in Rapunzel's hair... as long as it's not cut. Fast-forward umpteen years, as we're never quite sure how old Rapunzel is in the bulk of the film, and Rapunzel, who has never left Gothel's hidden tower, is bored, restless, wants to see the world, and has seventy-foot-long hair that provides the only entrance to Gothel's tower. Not that anyone but Gothel needs it, and she only goes out for monthly trips to the market. Enter Flynn Rider (&lt;em>Chuck&lt;/em>'s Zachary Levi), a small-time crook on the run both from the law--in the persona of Maximus, a horse of the royal guard who kept up the hunt when the humans abandoned it--and his former associates, whom Rider left to be captured, getting away with their latest acquisition--the royal tiara. While hiding, Rider stumbles into the hidden valley where Gothel's tower is located while she's off to market, touching off a long string of events that lead to, well, all the stuff you expect from a Disney princess film.<br /><br />It's all phenomenally cute, and you can't help but admire the animation, which co-director Byron Howard envisioned as a blend of traditional Disney animation and CGI (and how they pulled it off I'm not sure I will ever know). And yet there's always a voice in the back of my head telling me exactly how much I'm being manipulated by every last aspect of this film. To its credit, &lt;em>Tangled&lt;/em>, like most Disney films, is absolutely transparent about this, and so I guess I should give it points for honesty. I definitely give it points for the fact that I just don't care as much as I should about how certain minor characters are there just to advance the plot, and that whole "the songs sound like they were written by committee" thing; if you're going to hire a major recording star, why not let her write her own stuff? (And the switch some years ago from hiring straight voice actors to hiring major stars is a whole other rant in itself, and it's infuriating, and I'll stop now or we'll be here all day on that subject.)<br /><br />And yet despite all that I'm attacking all the things about the movie that SHOULD be attacked is how much I enjoyed the silly thing. Yes, it's predictable, as predictable as any Disney princess movie, and yes, you will know from the outset this film is manipulating you (the first line of spoken dialogue, from Flynn Rider's voiceover: "this is the story of how I died."), and it doesn't matter one bit. No matter how hard you resist, you will be assimilated, at least for the hour and a half it takes to watch this movie. *** ?</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>All the big pieces fit the Disney formula: princess in distress, lovable rogue, wicked stepmother/senior advisor, a few musical numbers, and a Jiminy Cricket character - Pascal the chameleon, my favorite to date in his line of descent. Like any good recipe, though, it's what they do with familiar ingredients that makes this dish especially tasty.<br /><br />Rapunzel, although she has plenty of the pining princess about her, wields a mean fry-pan, though. Maximus, a mighty battle steed, gets some great parts to play, too - some of his "scent tracking" moves are a riot. In fact, anything the animators could do to make this a visual treat they did beautifully, including all the characters' motions as well as the ever-present hair. And the den of thieves - well, they're nice thieves. As happened with the little mermaid and so many other old stories, the Rapunzel of the classic fairy tales might not survive Disneyfication. Well, it's a fair story anyway, with plenty of adventure but with nothing truly dark enough to upset the little kids that thronged  the showing I saw. As always with Disney flicks of this kind: good, but forgettable.<br /><br />- wiredweird, reviewing the 2D release to theaters</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>One of the pleasures of watching "The Princess and the Frog" a year ago was in knowing that Disney was getting back in touch with their roots. They gave us a traditional hand-drawn animated film, a process they had abandoned after the 2004 release of "Home on the Range." It was like witnessing a glorious rebirth, the resurrection of a seemingly lost art form. My hope what that it would once again become custom for animated films to be done by hand. It may be painstaking, but can you deny the beautiful results? The backgrounds. The form of the line. The coloring. The lighting. The mattes. Alas, it wasn't to be; for "Tangled," Disney has once again discarded pencil and paper for a computer screen. They have also released it in 3D, a cinematic beast that cannot be tamed.<br /><br />But please, don't get the wrong idea. "Tangled" is not a bad movie at all. It's funny, sweet, and adventurous, and it's strong in character, story, and theme. And like all the good Disney animated films, hand-drawn or otherwise, it puts a refreshingly modern twist on a classic fairy tale, "Rapunzel" in this case. It also employs a major talent that "The Princess and the Frog" would have greatly benefited from: Composer Alan Menken, who - along with lyricists such as Tim Rice, Stephen Schwartz, and the late Howard Ashman - was a key figure of the Disney Renaissance, having composed such memorable tunes as "Be Our Guest," "Under the Sea," and "Colors of the Wind." His ear for melody compliments Disney so well, it's almost a shame it isn't like it was in the Golden Age of Hollywood, when cast and crew were contractually obligated to work for a specific studio.<br /><br />"Tangled" begins with the story of a golden flower that sprouted when a drop of sunshine fell to Earth. It glowed like fire and possessed magical rejuvenating properties when sung to. A vain old crone named Mother Gothel (voiced by Donna Murphy) depended on it to continuously restore her youth, and so it remained for several centuries until the Queen of the kingdom fell ill while pregnant; upon drinking an elixir made from that golden flower, not only was the Queen brought back to health, she also gave birth to a daughter with magical golden hair. Gothel, desperate to reclaim her immortal good looks, is forced to kidnap the infant princess, since cutting her hair off robs it of its healing powers. And so the princess was raised as Gothel's own in an isolated tower, where she was conditioned to be fearful of the outside world while her hair continued to grow longer and longer and longer.<br /><br />We meet this princess, the innocent Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore), on the verge of her eighteenth birthday. Although she takes Gothel's lies at face value, she remains curious about an annual event held off in the distant kingdom: The releasing of hundreds of floating lanterns, which Rapunzel has figured out are not stars. Is it a coincidence that this event takes place on her birthday? She would like to find out. Here enters the film's narrator, Flynn Rider (voiced by Zachery Levi), a handsome, smooth-talking bandit who seeks refuge in Rapunzel's tower after robbing the King and the Queen. Upon coming to after being whacked in the head with a frying pan several times, he and Rapunzel strike a deal: If he promises to take her to see the lantern ceremony on her birthday, she promises to return his stolen loot, which she has hidden from him. And so begins Rapunzel's first venture away from home, a journey that will include chases, encounters, escapes, revelations, and yes, even romance.<br /><br />It's traditional for an animated film to feature supporting players that are funnier and more memorable than the protagonists. "Tangled" provides us with several such characters, including Rapunzel's pet chameleon, Pascal, and a royal horse named Maximus, who has the nose of dog, the reflexes of a cat, and - when in the presence of Flynn - the personality of a mean older brother. We're also given a number of pub-crawling thugs who secretly harbor sentimental hopes and dreams. One of them, voiced by Brad Garrett, has always wanted to be a concert pianist, despite having a hook for a hand. Inspired by Rapunzel's innocence, they all reveal their desires during the film's best song, a hilarious showstopper called "I Got a Dream."<br /><br />"Tangled" is, in short, a pleasant, entertaining, competent animated film, a decent addition to the Disney animated-feature canon. Even so, I would have preferred to once again watch a traditional cel animated film. Perhaps I'm remember with longing the days of glorious labor-intensive productions like "The Little Mermaid," "Beauty and the Beast," "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," and classics like "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," "Pinocchio," and "Sleeping Beauty." Simply looking at these movies is an experience unto themselves. I also think that the film's original title of "Rapunzel" would not have altered its success in any way, despite Disney's belief that "The Princess and the Frog" lost out on a potential viewership of young boys. Forget about marketing and demographics - just focus on the story.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>Disney shows it still has the chops in this its 50th feature length animated movie.  As you would expect with almost all animation done in the U. S., the artwork is flawless.  For example, Sleeping Beauty...no I mean Cinderella...no wait, Rapunzel (a very good Mandy Moore) spends all of her time barefoot.  In close ups when her foot hits the turf, you can see her toes actually spread apart as they would in reality.  The detail is amazing.  The color as good as you will ever see.  I must confess, I knew literally nothing of the story of Rapunzel other than she had long hair.  Now I do.  She was born a princess, but kidnapped by an evil woman who knew the magic, the child's hair had.  When Rap' sang, the hair glowed and could cure injuries and other maladies, including aging.  Stroking the long golden locks kept the woman, Gothel (Donna Murphy) young.  Posing as her real mother, Gothel keeps Rap' in check in their hidden tower/home.  As she gets older, Rap' wants to see the outside world and gets her chance when a good natured thief stumbles upon the tower.  Naturally the thief, Flynn Rider/Eugene (Zachary Levi) is young and hunky.  They make a deal and he helps her see the kingdom for the first time.  You can pretty much guess the rest.  They meet interesting characters along the way, deal with evil, charm the townsfolk, dispatch the bad guys and live happily ever after.  The music is always important in these movies and here I would say it is pretty good, but far from great.  There are no memorable tunes.  The story is rote, but the comedy is pretty good.  The horse steals the show and had me cracking up.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>How do you tell the traditional fairy tale - princess locked away in a tower only to be rescued by dashing hero - in a CGI format for modern audiences?  The answer is...Tangled.<br /><br />The staples are all here: the adorably wide-eyed princess Rapunzel (Mandy Moore), the handsome rogue Flynn (as in Errol) Rider (Zachary Levi), the villainous stepmother Gothel (Donna Murphy), and two heroic critters - Maximus the lawful good warhorse and Pascal the chameleon (voice by Frank Welker, master of the entire animal-voiced kingdom). A magical flower falls to earth that has restorative powers that heals the wounded and promise eternal youth, but when the queen's childbirth becomes...difficult, the flower is turned into a poultice, bestowing its curative effects on the young princess. The problem is that Mother Gothel was using the flower to keep her eternally youthful and, upon realizing that Rapunzel's hair now has the same powers, kidnaps the girl and raises the child as her own.<br /><br />Whew.  Got all that?  Early on, it becomes clear Gothel is blessed with superhuman abilities to do evil things.  She is basically an old lady who really, really likes being youthful.  We never get any insight as to why this is - she never flirts with anybody, so it's surely not for the obvious reasons - and so Gothel becomes a cipher helped conveniently by the plot.  She gets the drop on two huge thugs! Tangled was obviously uncomfortable turning Gothel into another witch, but I kept hoping she had some magical tricks up her sleeve.<br /><br />Speaking of Gothel, she acts like Faye Dunaway from Mommy Dearest and looks like Cher. She is manipulative, loving, protective, and saps her daughter's self-esteem at every turn.  Gothel is, in other words, a post-modern villain palatable to audiences who are unlikely to accept a stepmother that managed to keep her daughter in a tower for nearly two decades. And yet, once Gothel's secret is out she transforms into an unrepentant harpy.<br /><br />Gothel's manipulative skills are at their peak when she sings "Mother Knows Best."  Given the breathtaking old-school style of animation the film invokes, it's a shame that the music simply can't keep up. The actors rarely launch into full-throated song, preferring instead to half-talk, half-sing their way into and out of what should be true theatrics.  In fact, Tangled at times feels like a Broadway play, unwilling to go all-out because the director fears his cast can't hit the high notes.  There's not a single memorable song in Tangled's hairnet.<br /><br />Flynn Rider has his own problems.  His age is indecipherable, but it's certainly older than eighteen-year-old Rapunzel. He's been around long enough to have a reputation as a lady's man and an accomplished thief, which makes him old enough to know better, but never mind that. Rider narrates the tale but rarely hasn't much of interest to say- his narration could have been removed completely without affecting the story.  Also, Rider's a world class jerk, backstabbing his partners in crime for no other reason than greed.  Even the other characters point out that his dream (to have a private island with piles of money) is terrible. Rider eventually gets it knocked into his head (literally) that Rapunzel is his dream...which is a bit of an uncomfortable message (you're either greedy or utterly devoted to your spouse), but not unexpected for a Disney film.<br /><br />Just about every character in Tangled has a surprising dark streak that saps their fairy-tale qualities.  Maximus is willing to slit Rider's throat, Pascal gleefully defenestrates an old lady, and even Rapunzel turns on her formerly beloved stepmother in the blink of an eye. The most lovable characters are the self-confessed rogues at the Snugly Duckling.<br /><br />Tangled wants to have it both ways - edgy and innocent, fairy-tale and girl power - but ends up somewhere in between.  It's got all the right ingredients, but they don't quite (hair?) gel.</p></br><a href="../users/ALLIGF5OZM1I6.html">ALLIGF5OZM1I6</a><br/><p>TANGLED<br /><br />STARRING: The voices of: Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi, Donna Murphy, Ron Pearlman, M.C. Gainey and Jeffrey Tambor,<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Dan Fogleman<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Nathan Greno and Byron Howard<br /><br />Rated: PG<br />Genre: Animation / Comedy<br />Release Date: 24 November 2010<br />Review Date: 31 December 2010<br /><br />Now here is a film I was not expecting much from, that delivered an amazing time at the movies! What a discredit to the film, the trailer for Tangled was. It's a take on the timeless tale of Rapunzel: the girl with incredibly long hair who has been locked away in a tower. Disney has revamped the story, complete with some zany modern day jargon and the vocal talent of Mandy Moore.<br /><br />Disney takes us back to the likes of classic stories such as Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin. Tangled is a much simpler film than those, as far as plot and characters are concerned, but it feels just as magical. The animation is stunning, and there is some amazing cinematography; something I really enjoy seeing amidst the colorful backdrop of an animated landscape. Oh, Rapunzel's tall tower, tucked away at the edge of a forest by a waterfall. It reminded me of something Lara Croft would stumble across in a Tomb Raider game.<br /><br />The movie is also very funny. We meet a guy named Flynn (voiced by Zachary Levi) who much like Aladdin, is a thief but isn't the worst of guys. He's hilarious, charming and cunning and he's about to meet his match: Rapunzel.<br /><br />Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) was kidnapped at a young age by an evil woman fed up with her aging looks. She took her from her home because she possesses a few very strange gifts that allow her to work miracles. The one of most importance to our villain being that when she sings, her hair glows and can transform the decrepit old woman into one hot little animated dish of yummy. The woman raises Rapunzel as her own daughter.<br /><br />Every year on Rapunzel's birthday, magical lights that hold meaning to the story, light up the sky. She is fascinated by this and dreams of seeing them up close, as she can only see them from her window. For fear that she will be found out; the mother forbids her from ever leaving the dusty old tower that is so high up, access can only be gained by the lowering of a very long rope. Or a very long ponytail!<br /><br />Naturally, Flynn happens upon Rapunzel's tower by mistake when fleeing from someone he's just robbed. While her mother is away on a three day trip, Rapunzel decides to call on the aid of Flynn. Stashing away his precious stolen high dollar item, she blackmails him into taking her to see the lights before she will return it to him.<br /><br />And thus their adventure begins, and only looks better in 3D, so go see it!</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>"Tangled" continues the rich Disney tradition of adapting age-old fairy tales to the big screen. As with most of their animated films, they start with a well-worn fairy tale, in this case "Rapunzel" by the Brothers Grimm, make it a little more modern, add some songs, in this case, all pretty forgettable, and toss in some amusing sidekicks. The twist on this "Princess" (I hope Disney doesn't have the word trademarked) tale is the addition of a male hero who has as much, if not more, screen time as Rapunzel. And, of course, the film is presented in 3-D, which now seems to be required of all animated features.<br /><br />"Tangled" follows a tried and true formula, the same formula that helps make "The Little Mermaid" and "Beauty and the Beast" such classics. John Lasseter, the force behind Pixar, is now in charge of both Disney and Pixar. Thank goodness he recognizes that this formula is necessary and has resurrected it. Disney films will only benefit; they once again have a zippier, funnier pace, more wild and funnier sidekicks and better lead characters. Strangely, these are all of the same things Pixar films are known for.<br /><br />One of the first things Lasseter did when he took the reigns was to revitalize the animation wing of Disney. How could anyone with even an inkling of childhood magic left within them let such a magical institution lapse? They were no longer going to produce 2-D animation, but Lasseter changed course and the company made "The Princess and the Frog", introducing Disney's first African-American princess. "Frog" is a lively film set in New Orleans in the 20s featuring a lively, eclectic score. It is a very good film but it is also considered a financial flop. I hope they will continue to make more films in the traditional way. It often creates a much more artistically superior film. They just need to ramp up the creative juices and come up with the next "Little Mermaid"-esque hit.<br /><br />Next up, "Rapunzel"... er, "Tangled" which really shows a lot of Lasseter's influence. While the characters have that classic Disney look, they are created by CGI. But this CGI is actually really good. The animation gives everything a rich, full quality, almost as though you are watching a 3-D film without the glasses. The wild and wacky quotient has been upped, giving Rapunzel and Flynn Ryder an assortment of funny supporting characters. Most of these take the form of a group of traveling marauders the heroes encounter at an alehouse. Ron Perlman, Brad Garret, Richard Kiel (Jaws from the James Bond films), MC Gainey and others give these characters voice. There is also a little drunk man who frequently appears with wings and a harp. It sounds strange, but the bizarre quality of some of the characters helps the story move along at a fast, refreshing pace.<br /><br />The one thing Lasseter seems to have been unable to help is the handful of forgettable songs included throughout. But then again, the Pixar films aren't known for their songs either. I honestly can't remember a single lyric which is shameful given they were all composed by Alan Menken, one half of the duo who made "Mermaid", "Beast" and "The Lion King" so memorable. Mr. Lasseter, if you can't create enough memorable songs, leave them out all together. A bunch of forgettable songs stick out for all of the wrong reasons.<br /><br />Also, leaving the songs out might prevent you from using pop music stars that provide less than memorable voice work for the lead character. Yes, I'm talking about you Mandy Moore.<br /><br />Because of the perceived mixed reaction to "The Princess and the Frog", the focus of the story was shifted to feature more of the dashing hero, Flynn Ryder (Zach Levi, TV's "Chuck"), a bandit marauding through the kingdom, trying to get his hands on anything valuable. Given the "Princess" phenomenon at the Disney marketing machine, they need to have a pretty young girl at the center of the story, but in an effort to also attract young boys, Flynn becomes the narrator of the story and our guide.<br /><br />After stealing a crown, Flynn runs from the royal guard and soon finds himself in the middle of the glen, deep in the forest, looking at a tall tower. He climbs to the chamber sitting at the top and feels he is safe. But he is quickly knocked out. When he comes to, he realizes Rapunzel, a teenager with seventy-foot long hair, has captured him. Rapunzel lives in the tower with Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy), who is away, and the young lady has never left the tower. Flynn desperately searches for his satchel (and the crown) and learns Rapunzel has hidden it. Her ransom? She wants Flynn to take her to see the floating lights that appear every year on her birthday. If he does this, he will get his satchel back. He reluctantly agrees and they are off. Shortly thereafter, Mother Gothel returns and panics. She has her own selfish reasons for keeping Rapunzel in the tower. Along the way, Flynn and Rapunzel run into an odd assortment of characters.<br /><br />"Tangled" is beautiful to watch, funny, moving at times and a worthy addition to the Disney tradition. Too bad they couldn't come up with more memorable songs to add to the magic.<br /><br />I really, truly hope this is the beginning of a new renaissance at Disney. It would be so nice to start to see some films that can once again rival the magic of the more recent classics ""Mermaid", "Beast", "Lion King". It would be even more spectacular to see some films that might be able to rival the original classics "Snow White", "Pinocchio", "Bambi", "Lady and the Tramp", "Cinderella". If anyone can pull this off, it is Lasseter.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VLX5Z090RQ0V.html">A3VLX5Z090RQ0V</a><br/><p>"Tangled", by all means, represents Disney's return to the true princess fairy tales since decades.  Last year's "The Princess and The Frog" may seem like a princess tale due to the title itself, but it was a princess tale based on technicalities and loopholes (which, btw, were pretty clever approaches to that movie's story); it's Disney's return to traditional animated films, but not a proper return to the golden era where marketable animated girls of royal background take center stage.  "Tangled" actually is, and this film feels very reminiscent to Disney's hand-drawn classics, even though it's computer-animated: it has a chivalric setting, vibrant scenery, a female lead who wishes for something more, a dashing hero/rebel, an evil step-mother, songs of whimsy, goofy comic-reliefs, 'dreams come true' speeches, and a valiant story filled with contrived set-ups and implausibilit---I mean, filled with magic. Not only does it capture these elements with a sense of nostalgia that will cater to the old as well as the young (fun for the whole family and all), it manage to be refreshing and bold while staying true to its roots.<br /><br />Typing from someone who has seen more than his share of fairy tale movies than he's willing to admit, this has a by-the-books story; not a lot of surprises to be had from a narrative standpoint, but then again, Disney doesn't enjoy subverting its own formula.  It has its leads, they go on a journey (trials and romance abound), and the simple audience gets what they want.  But much like "The Social Network", which is also formulaic in its story, this film manages to be very good because of its execution.<br /><br />For one thing, it's the musical numbers.  Being an animated musical, and also the first computer-animated musical made by Disney, one has to face the fallacies of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305236585">embarrassingly weak songs</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005UJ9X">tacked-on musical transitions</a>; Disney movies aren't really known by them, but I can't say its characters suddenly go into song really makes sense to me.  However, Disney managed to step up its game by making the act of singing an integral part of this movie's plot.  See, the evil Gothel had to sing to a magical macguffin flower so she won't grow old, and when she kidnapped Rapuznel as a child and raise her as her own daughter due to backstory-related reasons regarding that flora of youth, Gothel made her sing so her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YHX4B0">magical hair</a> can glow and revitalize Gothel's age; since Gothel and the now-legal age Rapunzel made chirping a tune routine, their singing came naturally for them.  There was also a well-crafted musical number that took place in a saloon, where all the grunts and vikings were singing about their dreams; one of the lead characters didn't want to sing, but they threatened him to sing anyway, which made the number delightfully humorous.  If there's one musical number I thought was 'tacked on', it's the "I See the Light" sequence...and yet it's not tacked on; it's hard to explain, but maybe because the sequence itself is so enchanting, it can get away with being tacky.  For the most part, the musical sequences were excellently handled.<br /><br />Comparing to "Princess and Frog", character-wise, the leads in this film were more engaging and interesting than Tiana and Naveen.  But when it comes to villains, Gothel is pretty weak compared to the conniving Shadow Man.  While I appreciate that she treated her 'daughter' with some degree of humanity compared to other Disney step-mothers, her obsession to keep Rapunzel secluded in a tall tower for the sake of eternal youth made her appear less sinister and more <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005J6RD">Joan Crawford</a>.  Back to the leads, Flynn the dashing thief has to be the smuggiest smug-face smuggers I've ever smuggin' seen this side of Dreamworks; even when he had a change of heart, found a person that's more important to him than what he stole and all that usual character development, he still had that arrogant smirk.  However, I grew to like him because he can be charismatic with his one-liners and when he does his heroic deeds later on.  There's a strong chemistry between him and Rapunzel, and there's a lot of joy to be had from those two; the funniest scene of the film happened when Flynn took Rapunzel out of her tower for the first time and she goes through a schizophrenic blast of exuberance and misery while Flynn just sulks, which was ingenious in both comic delivery and juxtaposition.  Nice that the movie took the "Aladdin" approach in having the animal sidekicks not talk but rely on physical gestures to give them personality, and I really dig the chameleon as well as the brave steed; they don't hog much of the screen time, but that's a good thing.<br /><br />I'm amazed at how the Disney princess archetype has evolved over the years.  The likes of Snow White and Cinderella don't have much in the way of multi-layered personalities outside of being kind and pretty (or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VAR0T8">Belldandy</a>), and it's only until "The Little Mermaid" that princesses started to have some depth to them; although, the deepest some can go is being assertive and independent, pretty much the 'woman in a man's world' mentality that grew to succession in reality.  And then comes Rapunzel, a proper evolution to the stereotype.  She's such an amazing character, because she has that dainty innocence as the old princesses as well as the defiant attitude of new princesses; it all says she's a woman in heart and body, but can still hold her ground, which is more than I can say about many tough action girls.  Rapunzel also has some unique quirks to give her distinction, like her hyperactivity; she's practically a child, going bananas at all the new things she sees or wanted to see.  The fact that her life was explored from the beginning made me understand her, made her compelling as she journeys not only to know her past, but to maturity.  No doubt she's right up there with Jasmine as one of the best Disney princesses.<br /><br />Again, "Tangled" is following a familiar tale, but such familiarity comes with great characters, a solid adventure that's clever and exciting, moments of levity and grim, and a resolution that, while not quite as good in the same manner as "Wall-E", is so moving that it's worth suspending one's predictions.  The songs themselves are very moving; each song is catchy, energetic, and easily inviting.  These compliments come as no surprise since Alan Menken composed for this movie, who also wrote music for most of the Disney Renaissance films and had a history of turning sappy love ballads into diamonds.  Speaking of, "I See the Light" is personally the highlight of the soundtrack, a sublimity that owes much from "A Whole New World". I really like this song and I can't wait to see the accolades it deserves, and I can't wait for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B58D08">America</a> to try and ruin it in a few years; good thing I have a frying pan to beat myself senseless when the latter happens.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CL82UITQJLWS.html">A3CL82UITQJLWS</a><br/><p>Eh, it was ok, lots of cutesy songs.

I felt this movie was more for girls though much like the princess and the frog.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>Tangled is the 50th film produced by Walt Disney's animation studio (for clarity, that number does not include joint productions, or Disney releases from other animation studios like Pixar).  This list of 50 includes some of the greatest movies of all time - Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, The Lion King, and 101 Dalmations.  Unfortunately, Disney studios has ceded the animation mantle to Pixar, and their last 10 films cannot hold a candle to the likes of Toy Story and The Incredibles.  So I was expecting, for the 50th film, a better effort, especially with John Lassiter as producer.  While Tangled does not quite live up to its more distant predecessors, it at least is an enjoyable 90 minutes, and it does contain some very nice animation and some big laughs.  It is also likely to be remembered as an "also ran" when compared to Disney's other release of 2010, Toy Story 3, which won an Oscar and set the box office record for most successful animated film of all time.<br /><br />Tangled is an adaptation of the Rapunzel story, elaborating and making Rapunzel's hair the fountain of youth (it's not as absurd as it sounds!).  I suppose that explains how she can drag it through meadows, rivers, and forests and never get it dirty.....  Unfortunately for Rapunzel, the hair needs to be attached to her head for it to work its magic, therefore she is held prisoner in the tower to satisfy the selfish needs of her adoptive mother, Gotha.  A thief named Ryder, fleeing from his latest caper, uses Rapunzel's tower as a hiding place, and their meeting sets in motion a chain of events involving Rapunzel and Ryder travelling to the royal city, pursued by the local constabulary, Ryder's disgruntled henchmen, and Rapunzel's "mother".<br /><br />Ryder's quipping asides generate many laughs, as do the antics of Maximus, a horse from the city guard that goes beyond the call of duty in trying to bring Ryder to justice.  There is also the joy of a remarkable action set-piece involving a breaking dam that is (dare I say it?) astonishing in it's animation (akin to the scale of Mulan's avalanche or the Lion King's stampede).  There is also the usual cast of Disney minor characters to lend colour and fun to the proceedings.  Certainly children will enjoy it, male or female, at least, if my 2 sons (5 and 3) and their female cousin (5) are any indication.  And it's ultimately harmless, certainly there are no traumatizing moments like Mufasa's death, and the violence is FAR less than that seen in The Incredibles or even Sleeping Beauty.<br /><br />But it doesn't quite all add up to a classic film.  I think the problem lies in the backstory - Rapunzel is kidnapped by Gotha from her parents, but there is no emotion in their plight because no time is spent in developing their characters or any relationship with their daughter.  By contrast, King Stephan has a prolonged scene in the middle of Sleeping Beauty, Mufasa teaches Simba and plays with him in the Lion King, and Belle's sacrifice for her father in Beauty and the Beast is not taken until after a number of establishing scenes showing Maurice by himself and with Belle.  Thus the reunion in Tangled has no particular emotion in it.  The second problem is with the music - there are a number of songs by Alan Menken (with lyricist Glenn Slater), but they sound like they belong in a Saturday afternoon teenage sitcom on the Disney Channel (e.g. "When Will My Life Begin" and "I See the Light"). True, "I've Got a Dream" is a joyous setpiece to rival "I Just Can't Wait to be King" or "Under the Sea", but one song does not a musical make.  Finally, I would be remiss if I neglected to point out that this is not a good value-for-money DVD.  Considering I paid the same price for Toy Story 3 and Tangled, the former has a number of neat extras, including a featurette on Pixar's modelling process, various short tours of Pixar's studio, and footage of a Buzz action figure on the International Space Station.  All Tangled has is footage on an alternate beginning which, while interesting, is paltry indeed compared to most Disney releases.  (of course, the intended audience will not care one whit that the DVD has no extras....)<br /><br />Overall, I'd place Tangled in with the likes of lesser (but still enjoyable) films such as Atlantis, Hunchback of Notre Dame, or Pocahontas (but better than The Rescuers or Tarzan).  And it's certainly better than most other animation out there that passes for children's entertainment, such as Will Farrell's Curious George, the Rugrats Movie, the Clone Wars film, and even Pixar's A Bug's Life.</p></br><a href="../users/A3APW42N5MRVWT.html">A3APW42N5MRVWT</a><br/><p>A fun retelling of the Nativity Story with Rapunzel as both the The Wise Men and The Child. You may need to think about that a bit, but it fits.</p></br><a href="../users/A2INL3AYAT6325.html">A2INL3AYAT6325</a><br/><p>After a decade of disappointing Disney films (NOT talking with Pixar) with only "Lilo and Stitch" as the only hit Disney decided to go back to tried & true.<br /><br />And, did they.<br /><br />It is a good film.  There is humor.  Supporting characters that we more exciting than the main characters.  That would be Maximus & Pascal.  Stole one name from "Gladiator"? We got back into regular Disney music for a film.  That is a plus, BUT which is major.  None of the songs are memorable.  I can NOT remember any of them after the film.<br /><br />Is colorful.<br /><br />When I wrote above about tried & true. I mean it.  You see several scenes here that were taken from both "Beauty and the Beast" & "Snow White.  When the film started I thought I was watching "Beauty and the Beast".  The superior film of course, "Snow White" again superior and the one that started the full length  animated films.<br /><br />The good guy is first a heal, hey Disney how about I saw that in "The Princess and the Frog"?<br /><br />So, it was a good try & a good film Disney.  Just NOT a bulls eye.<br /><br />NOW, THE COMPLAINT I HAVE WITH DISNEY NOW.  They think EVERYONE has a blu/ray player.  I do NOT.  Can NOT afford one or the discs.  So, Disney does NOT care about regular DVD's anymore.  There is only one extra on this and it is for kids.<br /><br />And, for a colorful film why a plain Jane silver disc Disney?  Cheap.  For a colorful film, beautiful animation a plain silver disc.<br /><br />Cutting corners does NOT make people customers happy Disney.  Disney has gone cheap, NOT the way to make money Disney.  I hope your company AGAIN uses sales because of these cheap tricks.<br /><br />Disney, you want to make money.  KEEP YOUR CUSTOMERS HAPPY.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CU4L3OK00M23.html">A2CU4L3OK00M23</a><br/><p>I went into this movie not expecting much. Most recent Disney movies have sucked. I was very surprised by the quality of the animation in this film. They put some serious effort into the background scenery, the water flowing, the lighting, ect. Many of those shots are worthy of framing. I did not like the character style, however. It reminded me of my daughter's Barbie movies and was very un-Disneylike when compared to the classics. Not bad, but not what I have grown to love.<br /><br />The story moved along fairly well with nothing terribly unexpected happening. My biggest disappointment was the music. A great Disney movie uses the music to set the theme for the movie and the music moves the story along. With a few notes you can pick out the theme songs of Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, or even the Rescuers. I can't remember a single song from this forgettable score and I just saw it yesterday. I got the impression the songs were stuck in there because all animated Disney  movies have songs, and not because they actually cared what the songs were.<br /><br />In the end, my daughter loved this movie and my wife enjoyed it. So it is better than the component parts. I will probably buy it, which is more than I can say for most Disney movies of the last few years, but it will not be a favorite.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Locked up in a tower under false pretenses due to the magical qualities of her hair, 18-year-old Rapunzel longs to see the colored lights that appear every year on her birthday.  When a fugitive thief blunders into her life, opportunity presents itself and adventure and romance follow.<br /><br />Disney's 50th animated film features beautiful animation, wonderful character design, excellent voice talent, and some terrific songs, but the script lets it down.  It lacks wit, relying too much on the other aspects of production to do the heavy lifting.  As a result, the familiar tropes of a Disney Princess film, such as the young woman with animal friends waiting for her life to begin, seem mechanical and unimaginative, as do the thugs with hearts of gold.  There are also too many moments when the screenwriter seems to have written himself into a corner and must rely on coincidence and unlikely meetings to get out of it.  However, the film's other strengths make it enjoyable and it does have some great moments.</p></br><a href="../users/AB0GGIQBNB36Q.html">AB0GGIQBNB36Q</a><br/><p>I'm going to get alot of comments on this, but I don't care. And when I write a review, I usually don't put a spiritual spin on things. But this movie leaves me no choice, as an Apostolic Pentecostal. This movie offended me, and my wife. I find it interesting that Disney, and most people today. Say that the hair means nothing, but that's not true. The Bible is very specific about a woman's hair, and I find it interesting that those who defend the short brown hair look. Over look the fact, that after that happens. Rapunzel is the one who asks Flynn to marry her, not the other way around. Which by the way, is a feminist view on things. I'll get comments for that. How dare the man be the one to ask, woman are equal to men. Said sarcastically, and yes. The mother figure, portrayed as being evil, is killed. But it's okay to disobey, because we don't believe in absolutes anymore. such as, an authority figure can't tell me what to do, I'm my own person. I would say, if you want to enjoy good Disney movies. Watch the ones from the 60's, 70's, and 80's. And a few from the 90's, by the way, for those who defend this movie, it's not even close to the original story of Rapunzel. Just a thought.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Disney's long tradition of musical animation never dies. Once again the company's latest work "Tangled" proves that. This is a family picture everyone can enjoy, telling a good story about characters you relate to, with a healthy dose of action and comedy. But what is most impressive is the film's breathtakingly beautiful colors that saturate the animation's fairy tale world.<br /><br />Based on a tale collected by the Brothers Grimm, "Tangled" revolves around a 18-year-old girl Rapunzel living in a high tower among the woods. In fact, she was kidnapped as a baby from the king and the queen by Gothel, an elderly woman who knows the special power Princess Rapunzel possesses. Not knowing the world outside (and her true identity), Rapunzel dreams of traveling to see thousands of lights that float in the sky once a year.<br /><br />"Tangled" mixes the orthodox "boy-meets-girl" theme with fairy tale elements (though any sexual allusions of the original tale are carefully removed). The film keeps a steady pace with musical sequences, action scenes and nice comic turns from fearsome-looking (but actually likable) thugs drinking at a tavern, plus one non-speaking animal, Pascal the chameleon. Also, Maximus, a white horse of the royal guard, is a real scene stealer, who deserves his own movie.<br /><br />But what makes "Tangled" really special is its rich colors and lush textures. The amazing sky lantern scene is one of the many highlights of the film. This alone would be enough to give the film four stars or even more.</p></br><a href="../users/A32T2H8150OJLU.html">A32T2H8150OJLU</a><br/><p>Disney's latest addition to the world of animated full-length features is a joy through and through.  I have to admit that I had heard so many positive things about Tangled before I saw it that I started to doubt whether it could be all that good.  As a result, I found my expectations lowering, and I went into the show with a critical eye.  What I found surprised me.  It was THAT good!<br /><br />The villian in this show is worthy of being grouped with Disney's best.  She is conniving, despicable, manipulating, and, well, evil...all to meet her own personal needs.<br /><br />The stroryline, characters, and their interactions were top-notch through and through.  I have to admit that one of my favorite character-character interactions was between Flynn Rider and the horse Maximus...you'll see.<br /><br />It was soon obvious that Tangled works at multiple levels: small children, tweenagers, teens, and adults.<br /><br />I happened to see the film in a theater that was completely packed (and in 3D).  When the movie ended there was actually applause.  The crowd liked it that well.<br /><br />I noted that John Lasseter (of Pixar) was the executive producer, but Disney pulled this off on their own...it wasn't a Pixar flick, though it's as good as Pixar releases.<br /><br />I look forward to the DVD release of this film, since it will certainly be joining my video library.<br /><br />5 stars</p></br></body></html>

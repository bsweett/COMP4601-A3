Combining the fast cars and lethal guns of modern action flicks with the mind-blowing hand-to-hand combat of classic martial arts films, The Transporter 2 delivers a thrilling roller-coaster ride of butt-kicking mayhem. The fights are superbly choreographed, and the special effects are quite litterally explosive. To make it all the better, this action I speak of is practically non-stop. Just when you think your heart might return to it's normal rate, all hell breaks loose. Simply put, Transporter 2 is a must-see film for anyone who loves a good action flick. Although it's not very realistic, it's a visual treat to any fan of the genre.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>70s car chases in an 80s movie shot with a 21st century look.  How can you go wrong?  It's like a Cannon picture with a budget.  Plus, Jason Statham is classic, a modern action hero born 20 years too late.  At least worth a rent when you're in the mood for this kind of thing.</p></br><a href="../users/AVT9Q9PTUCDMR.html">AVT9Q9PTUCDMR</a><br/><p>Although on one of the extras the producer tells us there is more story in this one, I felt it was more action. Nothing wrong with that but there is no mystery. In the first one we went through almost 2/3rds of the flick to finally find out why the woman was being "transported."<br /><br />This one is pretty much a straightforward kidnap/chase movie with the usual shoot-'em-ups. Not that there is anything wrong with that but #1 is far superior as far as plot goes.<br /><br />Jason Statham, though, has better more classic fight scenes (you know, armed men 6 to 10 vs. 1) that show he is now a cross between Gene Kelly and Jackie Chan in his fight moves combined with use of props.<br /><br />The female assassin is classic from the concept of "yeah, let's have her shoot off her machine guns while wearing a bikini" to the way she fights in her final scene we have certainly never seen metallic beaded drapes ever used in such a creative way.<br /><br />All in all great fun all around with enough stoicism under fire from Statham to make it all seem like Transporter, you never disappoint us.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>Jason Statham returns as Frank Martin, in the high-octane action thriller, The Transporter 2 (2005).  Luc Besson (La Femme Nikita), and Mark Robert Kamen, who co-wrote The Transporter (2002), also penned the screenplay for the sequel, and Louis Leterrier returns as solo director.<br /><br />Martin has left France, and is now is Miami, behind the wheel of an Audi, hired by Audrey Billings (Amber Valletta), to chauffer her young son Jack.  An unscrupulous gang, led by gentlemanly terrorist Gianni Chellini (Alessandro Gassman), plans to use the young boy in a grand scheme, to infect the attendees at a law enforcement conference.  On a routine trip to the doctor, an attempt is made to kidnap Jack.  Frank manages to save the boy, surviving an encounter with hitchick Lola (Kate Naulta), and her twin machine pistols.<br /><br />The respite is only temporary, as Lola catches up with them, and with the police in pursuit, Frank gets a chance to demonstrate his mad driving skills, even flying from building to building.  Chellini does get his hands on Jack, and infected with a 'recombinant retro-immune double-polymorphing efferent', returns him to his family, to spread the virus to his father Jeff (Matthew Modine), successfully executing his deadly plan.<br /><br />The police, led by investigator Stappleton (Keith David), naturally believe they are dealing with a simple kidnapping.  French Inspector Tarconi (Francois Berleand), has arrived in Miami for a vacation, but finds himself arrested.  While in custody, he prepares some food, and also provides vital information that helps Frank discover what is really happening, setting the stage for the grand finale.<br /><br />For what it aims to be, The Transporter 2 is quite well written, zipping along briskly, with the little pieces fitting together quite nicely, with few loose ends.  Like CSI Miami, everyone seems to have an orange skin tone, even Tarconi, who unfortunately, does not get much of a chance to work on his tan, while on vacation.  With Cory Yuen choreographing, the fight scenes have his stylized look, and quick cut editing.  One featuring a fire hose, and another on a drydocked boat stand out, but the final battle with Chellini is a little anticlimactic.  The Transporter 2 has the same kind of spectacular vehicular stunt work as the first film, but pushes things to a higher, and more absurd levels.  With some totally outrageous stunts, and an over the top villain like Lola, the film has a flavor similar to a James Bond adventure, minus the romance.<br /><br />The DVD release is a little short in the extras department.  There are some deleted and extended scenes, and a short featurette, but no commentary track, or really substantial goodies.  Fans of action films, or Jason Statham, should not be disappointed by this effort, which is more intense, and flows more smoothly than the original Transporter.</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>Jason Statham reprises his role as Frank Martin in "Transporter 2," directed by Louis Leterrier ("The Incredible Hulk") and written by Luc Besson ("The Fifth Element"). Retired from his previous day-job, Martin is now living in Miami and is relegated to playing driver for a wealthy couple and their young son, and he wouldn't have it any other way. He lives a nice and stress-free life, playing somewhat of a nanny by day and enjoying a beer or two on his time off. All of that is put into a tail-spin - naturally - as he gets tangled up with some biological terrorists who plan on infecting the masses with a deadly new virus that kills in just four hours. It's a race against time for as he finds himself once again embracing his talents and matching wits against an Italian with a mean-streak (Alessandro Gassman) and a sexed-up but lethal vixen (Kate Nauta).<br /><br />"Transporter 2" is the best kind of action film you'll find these days. When you want to turn off your brain and simply soak up as much high-octane action as you can, this is exactly the kind of movie you should be searching for. The action is outrageous and defies physics, but none of that matters in a movie like this. If you can check logic at the door, the film will reward you all the more for it. You also don't need to be very well-versed in the previous film, as not only is the character of Frank Martin re-established well enough, but also because Jason Statham plays essentially the same role in every film he does. As always, he is in top form, charming and intense as the hero du jour.  The film is host to some over-the-top performances from its villains and some ridiculous action scenes (get a load of how Martin rids his car of a bomb!) but is brilliant, stylish and energetic. In the context of the film, you buy the silliness at hand and just sit back and enjoy the ride. If you want a film that respects all you learned in science class, then you have made a wrong turn, my friend. If you seek a thrill-ride of epic proportions, however, you've come to the right place.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>A new "superman" who never gets hurt,<br />but deals out damage left and right.<br />Plot is sort of clunky... he's a driver<br />of get-away cars, not children to school.<br />And a virus designed to kill international drug<br />diplomats and world officials?<br />But the stunts scenes are first class...<br />just not very believable by anyone above the age of 10.<br />I'm sure the Japanese loved it.</p></br><a href="../users/AIBRTGBN07D6A.html">AIBRTGBN07D6A</a><br/><p>I wasn't expecting much from this movie. I thought it would have some mindless action in it, and be entertaining. It was. However you REALLY have to maintain suspension of disbelief. Many of the scenes were absolutely absurd. Of course it had the crazy action moves that no one can physically do. I was expecting that. However there's one scene where Frank is in a plane that crashes into the ocean from about 40,000 feet up with no injuries. Apparently if you land in water it softens the blow and everything's okay. There are several other scenes like this, equally as bad. I cannot recall a movie I have ever seen that takes things like that to such an extreme. The stunts in this movie blatantly violate the laws of physics. The other bad part of this movie is the script has several huge plot holes. A virus is released that is supposed to kill people within 4 hours, but we never find out if the virus was stopped, and if so (which you can assume it is), how they were able to do it.<br /><br />Aside from that, I wouldn't really say the movie is bad. It is mindless entertainment with some decent acting. Horrible CGI however. I can't think of anyone but a huge Transporter fan who would want to own this and watch it several times. The only thing redeeming about this movie is the really awesome action sequences. As long as you realize this film takes place in an alternate universe where none of this stuff is possible, you'll be okay.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>IMO, better than the first one!  Cinematography grade A, action sequences awesome, it was perfect!  I love this movie and highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N.html">A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N</a><br/><p>I just recently watched Transporter 2,and it was everything I was expecting it to be.Aside from it's silly plot,it is a fun movie to watch.It has(like the original)spectacular,coreographed fight scenes,and the stunts...well,lets just say that are pretty amazing,but at the same time are unbelieveable.Stuff that only can be created for film and in cartoons.I am a Jason Stratham fan,I've watched all his movies(great&terrible) since his first film.This is a fun film,but not much more than that.There are allot of inconsistencies with the action,but hey...that's why its just a movie.Some of the FX bloopers are him being able to sheild himself from a hail of bullits with a wooden door,while in a scene directly after,the phsyco blond wastes some Miami cops and blasts holes through the cop car.Kinda funny if you ask me.This is a film I wouldn't buy,but well worth renting.If you want to see Stratham in some excelent films,see his first:Lock,Stock and two Smoking Barrels as well as Snatch.The original Transporter is about the same level as the sequel,but with a smaller budget.Hokey to a fault storywise,but a fun ride all the way.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>Let's start by saying "Transporter 2" suffers oh so slightly compared to it's predecessor because it's byzantine central plot and the villains are somewhat cartoonish.  That said, star Jason Statham as Frank Martin has lost none of his charismatic appeal from the first film.  He still amazes with his physicality in the action sequences.  It should be noted that the director of the original film, Cory Yuen, choreographed these scenes.  Terrific vehicular scenes most notably one where Frank pursues a bus with a speedboat and another where he dislodges a bomb from the bottom of his car with a crane.  Popcorn entertainment at it's best.  I can't wait for the next installment.</p></br><a href="../users/APIW11UEPKIC2.html">APIW11UEPKIC2</a><br/><p>I loved how this movie starts out with the joke to the kid about the doctor, he seemed to be playing his character from Snatch.  This movie actually goes downhill from this point on.  It had some pretty good fight scenes, but Statham takes liek 20 minutes to disbatch like 10 guys.  He's obviously not very fast, but they he could have taken care of the baddies quicker.  And I'm not talking about anything but the action, it would be way too hard to recall the story, I;m already starting o feel sick this of this stupid ass movie again.  I had more fun watching Exit wounds or timecop.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PIX2K56IZZYX.html">A2PIX2K56IZZYX</a><br/><p>Almost every review I read of this movie said the same thing, forget about the plot holes, bad acting, over-the-top action, and just have fun with it. Well, I really tried to do that, because sometimes it does work with some movies. (Dukes Of Hazzard comes to mind) But try as I might, the negatives just kept piling up, so no amount of cool fight scenes, witty banter, or endless car chases could flip this to a 3 star movie, sorry. Jason Statham is the only decent actor in this, and I will give the movie this, Jason is just so damn cool, he isn't the worlds greatest actor, and I think he knows this, so he keeps it low-key. Do you remember Steven Seagal's first few movies he made? (way before the recent truckload of crap he's made) Jason reminds me a bit of that, but one thing, Jason is the fastest I've seen.....That fight scene in the beginning where some thugs try to carjack his Audi is fantastic.<br /><br />Anyway, this time around, Frank Martin (Statham) gets mixed up in a kidnapping plot which is just actually a cover for our main bad guy to release a deadly toxin on the world. Speaking of our main bad guy, he really sucks, I think he is French, but his accent is  so muddled it's hard to tell. He is played by Alessandro Gianni, but he is not alone in the weak acting department, Kate Nauta plays his girlfriend, and whoever her acting coach is should thing about putting in some overtime, cuz' this chick needs some work!! Plus she has something aganst clothes, she runs around the whole movie in bra and painties, don't get me wrong, she's pretty hot, but come on, it can't be that warm all the time.....<br /><br />Amber Valetta and Mathew Modine play the parents of the boy who gets kidnapped by Gianni, Although Modine looks really old, they both are fine, Valetta plays the woman attracted to the hero but still in love with her hubby role well. The kidnapped boy (Hunter Clary) has some decent moments with Statham while he is driving him home from school, but that's pretty much it.<br /><br />Everyone I've read about or talked to say the real star here is the action, and that may be true. I will not argue the fact that there are some really cool scenes, and the fight scenes are all above average except for the final fight between Martin and Gianni, kinda boring and anti-climatic. But along with being cool they are so far-fetched and unbelievable, that you find yourself say huh? intead of ooing and awing. The car chases are way too long, and also ridiculous, he jumps from the top floor of one building to the top floor of another building and his little Audi doesn't get a dent let alone a scratch, I don't think so.<br /><br />The last half hour is just plain bad, like I said earlier, Statham's fight scene with Gianni is awful as they are fighting each other in a plane with no pilot. The CG during this is really bad and choppy filming doesn't help either. Statham's fight scene with Kate Nauta is the only short fight scene and that's a shame,  I think that could have been special. But she dies like 5 minutes after they start.<br /><br />I did enjoy the first one a bit more, better plot, better car chases, the fight scenes in this one are a bit more complex and thought out, and it shows. I gave the first one 3 stars, but this one was just plain silly and poorly acted, I'd say watch the first one again, and if you still need more Statham, rent the Italian Job again.<br /><br />acting.....2.5 stars, Statham and Valetta are ok, Gassman and Nauta are sad.<br /><br />directing.....2.5 stars, Might have been better with the director of the first one<br /><br />special effects....3 stars, Poor CG, but cool fighting and car effects<br /><br />action rating....3 stars, 2 awesome fight scenes, 1 decent car chase<br /><br />quality.....2 stars, Way too choppy, constant bad angles, A surprisingly high amount of grain, and poor dialogue.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Action films pay far more detail to spectacular events and violence than having an intricate story line.  Some consider it the Neanderthal of cinema genres, yet it has the capability to occasional raise suspense in nerve-racking situations through speedy car chases and a cavalcade of blood gushing shootouts.  These moments often take place when the situation feels genuine and not too far-fetched.  However, if the action sequences continuously break the law of physics and the acting performance feels unnaturally awkward it will have an affect on the audience despite the coolness of the stunts and cinematic fireworks presented on the screen.  Louis Leterrier's recent sequel Transporter 2 feels both unnatural and phony in an extremely over the top way, but it also has countless scenes with breathtaking action.<br /><br />The car crazy Frank Martin (Jason Statham) returns here in a sequel that will exceed its predecessor when it comes to the amount of cool action.  His new job as a driver for Jack Billings (Hunter Clary), an elementary school boy of a rich family, might initially seem a little below his standards and skills.  Yet, this ex-special force operative with masterful skills in martial arts and in operating vehicles among many other abilities does it as a favor for a friend (we never learn what friend and why.)  The family for whom Frank is driving also seems to have domestic trouble, as Jack's mother and father performed by Amber Valletta and Matthew Modine do not seem to get along very well.  In addition, Jack's mother seems to have developed a sudden crush on Frank, which brings about a slightly awkward scene where she visits Frank within the first 15 minutes of the film.<br /><br />Soon after the shallow introduction to all the characters something is bound to go wrong, as it does when a group of ruthless kidnappers led by Gianni (Alessandro Gassman) attempt to get their hands on Jack.  To make things even more complicated Gianni has a homicidal crazed beauty at his side that does everything she can to make life a living hell for Frank.  However, if the audience remembers Frank from the initial scene in the garage, they already know that Frank is the only one able to do something.  The opening brings to mind the same pattern as Man on Fire (2004); however, there is a cruel twist to kidnapping that has a far more lethal consequence than expected.<br /><br />Transporter 2 does have the right elements for awesome special effects and truly extravagant action.  However, it suffers greatly from the opening scene and throughout the whole film, as the audience must not think, as it would deter the audience from enjoying the cinematic spectacle.  For example, the drenched floor in the indoor garage in the opening shot seems completely out of place in the subtropical Florida weather, but it does give a cool reflective light effect to the car and the environment.  It is also strange how four car robbers could get into the garage without Frank (who has trained his attentiveness to perfection).  It seems that the action sequences would not have happened without the many inconsistencies throughout the film.  There is also a myriad of situations where the film breaks all possible laws of physics, which removes a great deal from the cinematic potential of the film.<br /><br />In Leterrier's previous film Danny the Dog (2005), he remains far closer to reality and in the process makes a much better film.  Here in Transporter 2 the director seems to create a videogame atmosphere where the hero can do simply anything that the director desires.  This would be ok if it was a fantasy film, but it seems as if Leterrier tries to incorporate authentic realism and fantasy, which only seems to create awkwardness.  The computer-generated imagery also feels phony, especially in the culminating fight in the end.  Besides these unenthusiastic comments, the film does possess some truly spectacular visuals that shine through in the photography and the awesome scene framing.  In its presentation, Transporter 2 could be the epitome of action through the uncontrollably amount of stunts and violence in the film.  However, the overall cinematic experience was a rather poor one when compared to the many gems in the action genre such as The Terminator (1984), Hard Boiled (1992), and L&eacute;on (1994).</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>I saw the Transporter and Transporter 2 not comparing it to any other movies like James Bond or the Bourne films and I thought the movies were amazing. The thing that was different about Transporter is the star to me was a surprise and from there I thought the film to probably be bad and was I wrong. Jason Statham nailed the role and made it a better film. The fighting scenes are so realistic you can almost feel the pain. The camera angles fit perfectly letting you see every angle of the car chases and fight scenes to add to the excitement. The story is pretty mediocre with a slight twist but because of Statham's fantastic performance in the first film you really watch this to see him recover what has been taken and destroy the man who took it. This film is not a regular one it's an action film that any action addicted fan must see. They make the film look as realistic as possible and I think it deserves more than 3 stars. Before you watch this get ready to see a movie with a lot of things you've never seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>"The Transporter" was a revelation in many ways: Jason Statham's portrayal of Frank Martin (the transporter), the French Riviera locales, the quick pace, expert editing, the car chases...all these things added up to a fun and at times thrilling movie.<br /><br />But, sad to report, "Transporter 2" does not live up to the promise of the first installment though Statham as Frank Miller is still a hoot: sullen, steely-of-eye, imaginative, intelligent but director Louis Letterrier has let our man Martin down by placing him in a only mildly entertaining situation with often boring, sometimes loutish supporting players: Matthew Modine and the gorgeous Amber Valletta (as the Billings) have to be the most poorly matched screen couple in recent history (I mean, can you really picture these two in bed?). And Miller as their chauffeur? Wouldn't happen in a million years. In fact, I had the nagging feeling that "Transporter 2" seemed awfully familiar what with  Miller downsizing to a chauffeur and his great relationship with the Billings' son whom he drives to and from school. "Man on Fire" maybe?<br /><br />On the positive side there is the, lifted from "The Blade Runner," tall and lanky Lola (Kate Nauta....a Rebecca Romijn clone) who almost beats the living daylights out of Miller and who also can discharge two (one in each hand) semi-automatics at the same time. Nice girl.<br /><br />All that being said, Statham does, through his super-charisma and action hero skills by the way, pull the movie out of the dumps by the scruff of its pants. But why stress the guy out this much? And unless, I misunderstood a line of his dialogue: is Frank Miller now Gay? If so, did he not bed the Asian sweetie in the first Transporter film? Confusing.<br /><br />"Transporter 2" is okay, Statham drips with machismo and screen energy...so with a large buttered popcorn, a Butterfinger and a large Coke...you should have a good time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Okay. One of my guilty pleasures is big, loud, dumb action films. The type of film uber-producer Joel Silver used to make as his stock and trade. Every once in a while, the genre creates a great film like "Die Hard" or "Cliffhanger". More often than not, the films are quickly forgotten.<br /><br />"The Transporter", released in 2002, is about as big, loud and dumb as they get. And a lot of fun. Throw bits of James Bond, Jackie Chan and Guy Ritchie films into a blender, add a dash of the TV show "MacGyver" and let a French director/ producer stir it all together and you have "The Transporter".<br /><br />When we first meet Frank Martin (Jason Statham), a mysterious character who really knows how to handle his customized Audi, he is given the assignment of transporting a female prisoner for some shady underworld types. The woman (Qi Shu), soon... Let's stop here and discuss rule #1 of big, loud, dumb action films. Don't ask too many questions. Why he has to drive a Chinese woman through the South of France is beyond the point, if there is a point. But because the woman is played by Qi Shu, a star of some stature in Hong Kong, Writer/ Producer Luc Besson and director Corey Yuen, a well-respected martial arts choreographer, seem justified in squeezing lots of martial arts into the mix. It also provides them a lame attempt at a romantic subplot. Finally, setting the action in the south of France gives them the opportunity to use all of those tiny, winding roads to fullest advantage during the chase sequences. See, it all makes sense. Right? Well, no. Not really. There are problems with the story, but that is beyond the point. When you have the type of over the top, over heated action sequences contained in "The Transporter", story is secondary.<br /><br />"The Transporter 2" is pretty much the same film with two key differences. The new film is set in Miami and this time, his cargo is a little boy, Jack Billings. Frank has taken a temporary job driving the son of the Billings (Amber Valletta and Matthew Modine (more on that later)) to and from school. Why would Jack Billings (Hunter Clary) need a transporter? Hid dad is the head of the US Drug Enforcement Task Force so every corner of his Miami home is guarded. If it sounds a bit like "Man on Fire"-light you are very perceptive. Just as Frank and Jack begin to bond, Gianni (Alessandro Gassman), a hit man, buys an exotic toxic substance and its antidote. His plan is to infect Jack and use the antidote to get Mr. Billings to do the bidding of his bosses, the Colombian drug cartel. Gianni's girlfriend, Lola (Katie Nauta, think "La Femme Nikita" with an eating disorder), is an assassin who likes to pull large guns out of her pink garter belts and start shooting. She's a bad shot, but doesn't care and simply sprays bullets everywhere. Like I said, the story doesn't matter much.<br /><br />"2" does one thing the first film did not. Because the premise is virtually the same, with one minor change, the problems with the film become more amplified, making them more noticeable, tipping the balance slightly. "2" contains some fun, well-choreographed action scenes and also a lot of over-the-top, jokey action scenes. A car chase is particularly memorable and a fight with a fire hose evokes memories of a more serious Jackie Chan. There is even a fight on an out of control jet which is as fun as it is implausible. The problem with these films is that Frank has to have something to care about, to make all of his effort mean something. In the first film, there was the lame attempt to develop a romance between Frank and Lai (Qi Shu). It was superficial and rudimentary, but it worked just well enough. In "2", director Louis Letterier attempts to have Frank bond with Jack. This relationship is just a little too `cutesie-pie' and tips the balance unfavorably.<br /><br />Speaking of Matthew Modine... Why did he agree to play Mr. Billings? That was more or less a rhetorical question. I know why. Because he isn't exactly on the "A" list (or even the "B" list) anymore and he needs to make mortgage payments just like everyone else. But Modine needs a better agent. He deserves better than this C-level supporting character that is on screen for all of 20 minutes.<br /><br />"The Transporter 2" has some good action scenes, but we are unable to completely overlook the problems with the story this time. Worthy of a rental when available on DVD. Beyond that, you're wasting your money.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>All sequels try their hardest to live up to their predecessors. Transporter 2 fails somewhat, as it's rated a PG13, instead of an R, which would have been so much better. If it had been rated an R, it might have turned out better. It wasn't shockingly bad - but then again, NOTHING can live up to Jason Statham on a motorbike, in a hospital gown, with the wind blowing.<br /><br />The story's different to the original, but it weakens it a bit, cos you seem to think Frank has come over all soft, 'babysitting' a little boy, for some unknown reason which didn't help. His dad is some big shot, the mother's lonely and more than happy to make sure Frank is doing OK. But there is no major love interest unlike the first Transporter.<br /><br />Kate Nauta, as Lola, the ultra skinny, ultra blonde chick (so much so that she looks like the chick from the group Roxette) was a big mistake in this film. It puts all women off watching it. Not only does she spend nearly all her screen time in lingerie and little else, but then she goes and gets wet. How original. She's very offputting throughout the entire film, and that failed for me. She probably HATED the director for putting her through that, plus, I could probably do my ironing on her stomach.<br /><br />The kid is injected with a virus, that will kill anyone who breathes it. But we don't discover this until what, the last 15 minutes in the movie? Plot lines are forgotton about quite quickly in this movie, and there is still some stuff at the end that doesn't quite come together. Which is disappointing.<br /><br />Although I did enjoy Transporter 2, I would suggest you to stick to the first film, or Crank. Hubba hubba.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q9YEG1XPEJN.html">A15Q9YEG1XPEJN</a><br/><p>The Transporter 2 is a fair movie, but it really misses on the things that made the original so darn unique.<br /><br />Frank Martin was an enigma in the original. He spoke little, but his actions spoke more than any words could.<br /><br />The original was sparse and had a decidedly European feel to in, including its funky weird soundtrack. The action was heavy and wild, but it was also somewhat believable.<br /><br />In the sequel, Frank Martin (compared to the first film) is almost chatty. He's a kinder gentler version of the first film's lead. He's a glorified babysitter this time out. It's more touchy feely than cold steel.<br /><br />The action is top notch, but I found myself laughing rather than being excited, since so much of it was quite ludicrous. Yes, it was fun to watch the chroeographed fight scenes, but they were so "rehearsed" that they actually jolted me out of the cinematic suspension of disbelief into "oh, this isn't remotely possible".<br /><br />I'm going to lay the blame on the director, the writer, and cinematographer for most of this films ills. Set in Miami Beach, this film is shot in very lush greens that exude the whole "tropical" appeal of the area. Unfortunately, it also takes away from the starkness that the first film provided.<br /><br />Babysitting...Hulk Hogan did it. Vin Diesel did it. So why not Jason Statham? Nope. I don't buy it. Statham is completely different than either of the others. He's never been larger than life. The actor and his personnae have always been less than large - intentionally: Snatch, Transporter 1, The Italian Job...but now this?<br /><br />Statham is the modern day Jean Claude Van Damme, only better. Statham can act.<br /><br />It is his performance alone that warrants the three stars I've given the film.<br /><br />I hope his next outing is more deserving of his time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LGT6UZL99IW1.html">A3LGT6UZL99IW1</a><br/><p>We know things are going to be pretty silly when the opening driving sequence is in an automatic. Let's watch the Transporter power shift an automatic trans. What skill, what cunning, what a load.<br /><br />Car stunts? Plenty. They're so over the top that I expect to see "acme" stamped on the side of the car and hear a "beep beep" as the Road Runner escapes yet again.<br /><br />If you're looking for a no-talent, underfed waif with size negative a cup and Tammy-Fae taste in makeup, here she is. Sexy she is NOT.  Come on?! There was potential to make this chick a threat, nay, even an equal to our Transportation Dude. The director opted in for the "I have not eaten in six months, can't do makeup, don't know how to act, full-auto clips that don't run out" look.  Pathetic.<br /><br />Sure, it was mindless (mindnumbing) entertainment.  But when it was (finally) over, I expected the Loony Tunes "That's all folks" - it was that cartoonish.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>With a super packed ending consisting of a special effect plane instead of a real plane, this movie rocks (sarcastic laugh) No, to tell you the truth, Transporter 2 is a big messy silly actioner with no brains. Jason Statham (The Italian Job 2003, Snatch) returns to the role of Frank who is now helping transporting a kid of a wealthy man, played by Matthew Modine (Vision Quest, Any Given Sunday) and his wife, played by Amber Valetta (Hitch) When Valetta asks The Transporter to take her son to the doctor the next day, Statham agrees with the proposal, then when he drops off the kid things get a little array when he fights his way out, with the kid from the bad guys who want the boy. Then, the bad guys take the boy from him and Statham finds out later, after all those fights and a long boring chase scene that the main bad guy, Chiani, played by Alessandro Gassman, has a virus that he injected into the boy and everyone around the boy, excluding his mom and dad get infected and it kills all of them. The first Transporter was good, wasnt the best movie but it was decent...this, the sequel, is crap. The action scenes, when not sprinkled with special effect, are ok...the physical contact fight scenes...especially when Statham uses a fire hose and the beginning scene where he gets car jacked was a chuckle but this just doesnt cut the ice. Also starring Jason Flemyng (Snatch, Deep Rising), Keith David (Reqiuem For A Dream, The Thing) and Katie Nauta who wields two guns while wearing bearly nothing.

One great thing about `The Transporter 2" is, unlike the overblown sequel of `Die Hard," it clearly knows what it wants to, or should do, for the action flick fans, providing nicely done stunts of shoot-outs, car-chases, and martial-arts fighting. Though the story penned by Luc Besson is nothing but borrowed ideas from `Man on Fire' or any other action films that features one tough guy and a bunch of stupid cops, `Transporter 2' surely delivers its goods, and faster than before.<br /><br />Two things are changed in the format of the original: one is the location that is moved to Miami. The other is that this time Frank's client is a rich American family, and what he carries is a little boy. Like Denzel Washington's world-weary hero, he is hired as a chauffer, but the difference is Frank has Jet Li-like physical agility that is seen in the opening sequences. In short, no one mess with him.<br /><br />Actually, someone messes with him when the family sends the boy to a doctor's. The killers including Kate Nauta's deadly assassin with lots of make-up in short pants show up before him, demanding that the boy should be delivered to another place. From then on, the fast-paced film shows lots of actions in succession without stopping a moment.<br /><br />[STATHAM RULES] `The Transporter 2' solely belongs to Jason Statham, who is truly in character. Always calm and stoic, Statham's Frank never lets you down, with the action hero quality that is rarely seen in Hollywood. Of course, behind the thrilling fight sequences is stunt choreographer Corey Yuen, and the use, or overuse of CGI is disappointing (and some of them are, to be honest, shockingly cheesy like a flying chopper), but Statham's presence makes up for the weakness of the film.<br /><br />But some demerits should be pointed out, and they are many. Besides the ineffective special effects, the supporting actors leave much to be desired, especially Matthew Modine and Amber Valetta as the parents of the boy, whose constant overacting bored me to death. Jason Flemyng appears as Russian killer, but his acting is a poor copy of his Jikyll turn `The League of the Extraordinary Gentleman,' and Kate Naura looks gorgeous but is quite empty. Alessandro Gassman's baddie is worse, with laughably heavy accent, which is just a stereotyped image of Latino youth.<br /><br />`Transporter 2" is an exciting movie experience as far as Jason Statham stays on the screen. Though the story often looks ridiculous, even stupid, the actions are better than average, well worth the money you may spend on this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>The previews for Transporter 2 looked so great, I couldn't wait to see it.  However, it was such a huge disappointment because of the shoddy special effects and lame fight sequences.  For example, there is a scene of a deranged model with smeared mascara, skimpy lingerie, and stillettos in a gunfight with the main character.  He protects himself from the bullets by using a standard woooden door as a shield.  Then in the next scene, she shoots ONE SHOT at a helicopter from at least fifty yards.  THE CHOPPER DISAPPEARS IN ONE PUFF - LITERALLY A PUFF - NO SMOKE OR DEBRIS.  Then there is a scene where she swings at him on a curtain, leg extended with pointy heel aimed at him.  The swing takes so much time, but he just stands there.<br /><br />Jason Statham is so gorgeous, manly, and a great martial artist, but the story was weak.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O2RCKAMSE9X7.html">A3O2RCKAMSE9X7</a><br/><p>Think of Jackie Chan played straight.  In THE TRANSPORTER II, director Louis Leterrier presents Jason Strathan as Frank Martin, who as in the original TRANSPORTER, contracts to deliver the goods without fail, regardless of the goods to be delivered. In this sequel Frank Martin has the more mundane job of bodyguard/chauffeur to a cute little boy.  Frank lives by only a few Golden Rules, one of which is that he will never promise what he cannot deliver.  He promises that no harm will come to the little boy, who is promptly kidnapped by a cocaine cartel druglord.  The bulk of the film is a non stop series of action sequences that occur so breathtakingly fast that the viewer does not have time to ponder their believability.  There is one sequence in which Frank drives (flies?) a superturbo Sports Coupe from one building to another in a manner that left me wondering whether any stunt driver would have risked his neck in such a fool stunt.  Then there are the fight scenes that bring to mind Jackie Chan, who when battling the usual gang of thugs, uses whatever props are handy.<br /><br />Part of the problem I had is that TRANSPORTER 2 continues the cinematic tradition of presenting police as walking sitting ducks who act only as straw men to be knocked down both by the hero and the bad guys.  In this case the bad guy is a bad girl, well played by Katie Nautea, who uses a twin set of Uzis to slaughter cops whose only job is to preserve law and order.  Frank is no less guilty as he manhandles a half dozen U. S. Marshals who get in his way.  The distinction between celluloid fantasy and reality is often blurred by films like the TRANSPORTER series.  When Hollywood decides to make a more realistic film about martial arts experts who either enforce or break the law, then the interest level of the resulting film may rise above the superficially glitzy to the level of realistic cinematic violence that marks movies of enduring fame.  Can you imagine Gary Cooper slugging it out with the bad guys in HIGH NOON while swinging a fire hose at them?</p></br><a href="../users/AG6UYD56VHOG1.html">AG6UYD56VHOG1</a><br/><p>Check out this person's review:  1 of 4 people found the following review helpful:<br /> Keep on Truckin', January 12, 2008<br />By  T.

Jason Statham has returned to repise his role as Frank Martin, The Transporter. Although Frank has traded in his BMW for an Audi, the character is the same and the action takes the first movie up several notches.<br /><br /> This time around, Frank is doing a favor for a friend and is "transporting" the son of a government official to and from school. Frank and the boy have developed a bond since the boy's father (played by Matthew Modine) always seems to be away from home on business and has lost touch with the boy's life (Modine's character gets his son a complete baseball outfit for his birthday, only to find out his son stopped playing last year and is now a pretty good soccer player). Unfortunately, a Miami drug runner (played by Alessandro Gassman) has plans to kidnap the child and use him as the carrier of a deadly virus to kill his father. Now it's up to Frank to save the boy and find the antidote to cure him.<br /><br /> If you enjoyed the first movie, this one won't disappoint. The fight sequences here are choreographed again by Corey Yuen (though he doesn't direct this time around) and Luc Beeson had a hand in the screenplay. This movie doesn't stray far from the original formula that worked so well (fast cars, martial arts battles every few minutes, Statham's quiet manner even in the midst of a dozen guys out to get him, etc). Statham keeps the character low-key through everything, as if nothing can worry the Transporter.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, in an attempt to take everything a step further, there are a few sequences that go over the top. Using a wave runner-on land-to keep up with a bus, literally dodging bullets in a hallway, and Martin's unorthodox method for disabling a bomb under his car are just a few of the moments to make you cringe. And the final battle with Gassman is so far steeped in unreality you'll probably find it hard to swallow the premise. Still, when it comes to one-on-ten combat with an angry mob, Statham makes it beautiful. In one scene of the first movie, he takes down two police officers while holding Qi Shu on his shoulders. In this movie, he disables several bodyguards at once in the same non-lethal manner. In fact, the movie wastes no time showing us Martin still has the moves by giving us one of the best fights in the movie within the first five minutes. And through it all, he never wrinkles his suit. And the sight of Frank behind the wheel of a Ferrari made the entire theater start talking when I watched it. If you thought he could handle a Beemer, wait until he shows you what he can do with a really fast car!<br /><br />The return of a character from the first movie (I won't spoil the surprise, since I never saw them in any of the previews) really shows us Martin's not just a driving machine-he's a man with friends.<br /><br /> If you're looking for deep, Oscar-winning performances and the feel-good movie of the summer, you won't find it here. If you're willing to suspend your beliefs in reality for a little while and want some over-the-top action and fun, you won't want to miss The Transporter 2.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TMAVN4CEM8U8.html">A1TMAVN4CEM8U8</a><br/><p>Transporter 2  DVD<br /><br />In this sequel to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008AOVL">The Transporter</a> Jason Stratham is in Miami working as a chauffer/bodyguard for a wealthy family who springs into action when the young son of his client is kidnapped.  The movie is full of high action car chases and stunts.  Set in the beautiful Miami, Florida area, so again if you don't enjoy high action movies, just sit back and enjoy the view.<br />Highly recommended for fans of Jason Stratham  , James Bond movies, and high action movies, especially car chases.<br /><br />Gunner  March, 2008</p></br><a href="../users/A1AUOVXPT5MYX4.html">A1AUOVXPT5MYX4</a><br/><p>I was not much of a fan of the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009VBTNM">The Transporter (Special Delivery Edition)</a>, a film which had similar elements to this sequel, but by the end of the movie had pushed itself to such ridiculous levels of disbelief as to leave you rolling your eyes. "Transporter 2" is also patently ridiculous, but this time director Louis Leterrier (who did not direct the original) manages to keep the movie flowing and it's transferable fun manages to overpower the moments that lead our rational brain to say "What the . . ".<br /><br />Once again, Jason Statham is Frank Martin, a 'Transporter', who moves a customer's valuables from one location to another. He asks no questions about his cargo, keeping to a code that allows him professional detachment. Frank has taken up a temporary job to help out a friend by transporting the son of a U.S. Senator (Mathew Modine). Frank has taken a liking to the boy (Hunter Clary), while his mother, Audrey (Amber Valletta), has taken a liking to Frank. In the midst of this, an international thief for hire, Gianni (Alessandro Gassman), assisted by his borderline dominatrix associate, Lola (Kate Nauta), have kidnapped the son, Jack, with the intention of holding him for ransom, and also making it appear that Frank had a hand in it at the same time. Frank escapes the kidnappers, only to start to believe that there is more to the kidnapping than meets the eye.<br /><br />"Transporter 2" is one of those films that should come with the warning label to check your brain at the door. Lots of things happen in "Transporter 2" that are outside the boundaries of reality. Cars defy gravity, human beings perform incredible stunts and survive and people are often in the right place at the right time. Yet, the film has a strong charm that is hard to ignore. A lot comes from the presence of Jason Statham. He is all business as Frank Martin, and he cements the film with his no-nonsense attitude. Statham is the epitome of cool in this film, and that is just what it needs. We can't not help but root for this man at the center of the film, and our interest in seeing him pull himself out of his scrapes is at times just plain lifting. Alessandro Gassman has just the right amount of boldness to be fun as the villain and Kate Nauta seems to be channeling a punk rock superstar as a deadly, but sexy assassin.<br /><br />The film's action, while borderline impossible, is well-staged. Unlike many recent action films that over-edit their action, director Leterrier keeps everything clear and the running. The fight scenes, choreographed by fight-master, Corey Yuen, are as good as anything in recent martial-arts action movies, with a lean towards slightly more realism than, say, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00030590I">Hero</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXR4">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a>.<br /><br />If you are looking for some entertaining action then this is it, just don't believe everything you see.</p></br><a href="../users/A37PV5GMP2ILJC.html">A37PV5GMP2ILJC</a><br/><p>Really - it is!<br /><br />The stunts in this movie range from "okay, that could happen" to "no freaking way", but the one thing it has going for it is the non-stop action.  Hunky Jason Statham is the main (the only) reason to watch this movie, and this time the delivery man with nerves of steel is slumming it as a chauffeur (as a favor to a friend).  Things get complicated when his young passenger is kidnapped, and the Transporter has to draw on his military training to get him back to his parents in one piece.<br /><br />The bad "guys" include the usual criminal mastermind who knows martial arts, and an assortment of goons in various sizes and shapes, but when we get to the pistol-packing babe in the underwear and the dumb and disheveled looking dude who's supposed to be a scientist, you can feel your eyebrows heading towards your hairline.  Fortunately, you're so busy watching Statham do his thing that you can actually swallow the storyline, killer virus scenario and all.<br /><br />Matthew Modine and Amber Valletta do their best with this jaw-droppingly impossible plot, but Statham again saves the day.  Forget reality for eighty seven minutes or so, and let the Transporter do his thing.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 5, 2006</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>The Transporter is a lot like a live action version of Riding Bean. What, you've never seen that anime?<br /><br />Okay, let me try again. Imagine the sad restraint of Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense. Then add the martial arts skills of Jet Li in Romeo Must Die and the driving skills of Robert DeNiro in Ronin. Mix well. Voila!  You have The Transporter, a martial arts action flick with a bald Special Forces guy (Frank Martin, played by Jason Statham) in the lead.<br /><br />The Transporter is one of those hidden gems amongst action films.  I stumbled upon it through Netflix.  When I told my family to watch it, they instantly became fans.  It's one of the first DVDs I bought after renting it (the second being Donnie Darko).<br /><br />The plot is almost ancillary to the point of the movie, which is to watch Frank drive real fast, kick butt and take names.  The attractive wife (Audrey Billings, played by Amber Valletta) of a politician with an anti-drug agenda (Matthew Modine), hires Frank to shepherd her son (Jack Billing, played by cute-as-a-button Hunter Clary) to and from school.  An Italian terrorist known only as Gianni (Alessandro Gassman, chewing up the scenery) and his psycho gun-toting girlfriend Lola (Kate Nauta) kidnap the boy.  But of course, there's a twist as to why they want the boy in the first place...<br /><br />There are a few attributes that distinguish The Transporter from the genre. For one, Frank is a cool, collected character.  He lives by rules, always arriving on time and impeccably dressed in a black suit, black tie, leather driving gloves, and white shirt. If he were merely a wheelman for other lead protagonists, that would be enough, but Frank has much more going for him.  He's a martial arts monkey, capable of climbing, jumping, kicking, and wielding just about anything he can get his hands on.  Frank also has a heart of gold, for young women and kids.<br /><br />Transporter 2 plays on all these foils to kick off the film.  Frank creates a guessing game for Jack each time he picks him up from school.  Isn't he sweet? The ladies love Frank: Audrey can barely keep her hands off of him.  But Frank's a good and respectful kind of guy, so he rejects her advances. What a guy!<br /><br />Once Jack is in danger, the gloves are off.  Frank sets out to beat the living tar out of the bad guys, and he does it despite the fact that guns are frequently pointed at his head.  It's all action, all the time.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie frequently overreaches itself.  Frank does some utterly ridiculous things, like launching his car over a ramp in order to scrape a bomb off with a hanging crane.  As opposed to say, just reaching under the car to pry the bomb off. Frank leaps down to the ground thirty feet without a scratch, smashes through a wall (twice, once with his car and once with his body), and none of it seems to be more than an inconvenience.  At one point, one of the characters asks, "Are you trying to be some kind of superhero?"  Thanks to Louis Leterrier's over-the-top filmmaking...why yes, yes he is.<br /><br />The other problem is that all these superheroics require a lot of CGI and the artists assigned to the movie were just not up to the task.  Everything looks fake: the exploding helicopter, the sinking plane--whenever an effect is called for, a big pink sign screaming, "THIS IS CGI" practically accompanies the shot.<br /><br />As an Italian-American, it's refreshing to see a bad guy who isn't a mobster.  As a particularly loathsome piece of Eurotrash, Gianni comes up with an insane plan at the end that makes no sense except to set up a peculiar requirement: now Frank must keep the bad guy alive if he is to save the boy and his family.<br /><br />The martial arts are amazing, as expected.  Fans of the first movie will notice that Frank seems to be in a bit of a rut, as he fights guys with axes (yet again).  And fans of Jet Li will be surprised to see Frank perform almost the exact same martial arts routine with a fire hose as Jet in Romeo Must Die. The connection: Corey Yuen, who obviously is hoping you didn't see both films.  I'm not kidding, it's almost an exact shot-for-shot take of Romeo Must Die.<br /><br />That said, Gianni also turns out to be a wuss.  After watching what can only be described as Matrix-style Kendo training, Gianni provides meager resistance to Frank, battles in spinning Lear jets not withstanding.  Why set up the bad guy to be so dangerous when he can be socked in the head a couple of times?  Heck, Lola was more dangerous.<br /><br />Throughout, Tarconi (Francois Berleand, reprising his role as befuddled French detective) helps Frank get the information he needs out of the U.S. government's databases and provides a good dose of humor along the way.  The entire film has tongue firmly in cheek, so it's difficult to be too harsh on a movie that doesn't take itself that seriously.<br /><br />All in all, Transporter 2 is a welcome entry in an otherwise crowded genre, with European sensibilities and style.  Forget XXX, the Transporter is my candidate for the James Bond of the 21st century.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>Professional transporter Frank Martin (Jason Statham) has surfaced once more for movie fans everywhere. A specialist in transporting goods from one spot to another without getting involved, Frank is the best there is. His current gig? Chauffer for a well to do family, the father of which is a member high in Washington's bureaucracy.<br /><br />Making sure that the official's son gets from one place to another, Frank ends up not only driving but getting involved with the young boy as well. So much for not getting involved. The two have a strong rapport and Frank teaches the boy things as well. On an ordinary trip to the pediatrician, the boy is kidnapped and Frank is thought of as the most likely suspect.<br /><br />Face it, fans of the TRANSPORTER films know right up front that there is no way that Frank Martin will let this kidnapping go on without a hitch or un-avenged. While the FBI and local police search for clues, Frank begins his one man battle not only to find the boy but to make sure that he is returned unharmed. The same can't be said for the bad guys that cross Frank's path.<br /><br />Both TRANSPORTER films relied heavily on action and taking a not so serious look at the genre that they attempt to command. And they both do just that, making us believe that Frank is capable of the feats he performs when fighting hand to hand or when using whatever objects are at his disposal to render those who cross his path inoperable.<br /><br />Jason Statham is not the usual gorgeous face that most leading men offer when a role like this comes along. Instead he seems more real, more deadly. And this sense of reality in appearance coupled with the unreality of the story lines and action seems to be a match made in heaven.<br /><br />Corrie Yuen returns as stunt choreographer for the fight sequences of this film and his work is probably the best that there is today in film. Nowhere else can you find the kicks, leaps and pummeling fists provided in such a ballet like form as in those that feature his work. Its enough that it makes you want to seek out more that he has been involved with.<br /><br />Director Louis Letterier, who helmed the first film along with Yuen as well as the recent UNLEASHED, will be a force to reckon with in the world of action films. Imaging his eye for detail and views of action sequences put to use in a Bond film would make the most die hard fan salivate.<br /><br />Sequels never seem to live up the expectations of fans of the first film. There is no way to replicate the first viewing of something different. It becomes old the second it is seen. The same can be said of this one, though it runs circles around most new films being released. And though a sequel, it does what so many films these days seem unable to do. It entertains.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Three years after achieving box office and DVD/Video sales success with the 2002 action packed film "The Transporter", director Louis Leterrier returned to helm the further adventures of ex-special forces operative Frank Martin in 20th Century Fox's hit sequel, "Transporter 2". Joining Leterrier would be star Jason Statham who skyrocketed to fame with his martial arts abilities, charm, and quick wit in the first film. But could a sequel to such a surprise hit do as much business and possibly better than the original? Not to mention the story, could "Transporter 2" continue what was started in "The Transporter" by having an over-the-top action film actually having a decent story to tie the fights together or would it crumble into another meaningless pile of fight scenes with shoddy dialogue mixed in for good measure, like so many other wannabes before it?<br /><br />"Transporter 2" finds Frank Martin, retired from his transporting profession, living a quiet chauffeuring a wealthy Miami family around. However, peace is not meant to be long-lasting for Frank, as the son of the family is kidnapped, leaving Frank as the main suspect. Now, the best in the business must get himself back in the game so that he can fight insurmountable odds to save the boy and clear his name.<br /><br />So, was there any hope of "Transporter 2" possibly rivaling the original in terms of quality, fun, and high-octane action, I personally didn't think so. Well, let me say that I was wrong, not only did "Transporter 2" equal the original film, but also I believe it actually surpassed it on all counts.<br /><br />The story was equally as fun and entertaining, by having Frank be a chauffer instead of a transporter of dangerous and/or illegal goods, was an interesting change of pace for the character, and one that worked well for him. As he was in the first film, Jason Statham managed to grab the audience instantly, taking them on an incredibly fun, high-energy thrill ride. One facet of the original that I thought was so impressive were the fast-paced fight scenes that were no doubt painstakingly crafted to perfection. Plus, the fact that Jason Statham did the majority of his own stunts added to the quality, but as great as most of the fights were in "The Transporter", the sequel managed to step it up several notches. Every move was much faster, the choreography much more precise and natural, leaving me feeling as if the first film seemed too rehearsed, lacking the fluidity that the sequel offered. Both films contain visually impressive fight sequences that are both somewhat realistic and over-the-top at the same time (which is where a lot of the appeal lies for these two films), but I do believe that "Transporter 2" definitely has the upper hand in this contest.<br /><br />Overall, "Transporter 2" is an excellent, equally over-the-top (one particular car scene involving a bomb, may be too much so, but I'm not complaining) sequel that surpasses the original film, and leaves the audience craving more, just as any good movie should.<br /><br />"Transporter 2" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief nudity.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>I can only say this in so many words.......<br /><br />Action!<br />Outlandish action, unrealistic action, but this movie is still a thrill ride and good movie. watch it!</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>After the surprise success of the first Transporter movie a sequel was inevitable but would it be as good? This is a question that is always asked of sequels because most movies don't need one. However, studios hungry for profits are always on the look out for a film franchise that they can exploit. The Transporter has such potential with each film being its own self-contained adventure complete with beautiful women, cool car chases and exciting fight sequences set in exotic locales.<br /><br />If you liked the original then it is pretty much guaranteed that you'll dig this one as it serves up more of the same only cranked up another notch: the car chases are more fantastical (thanks to CGI) and the bad guys more colourful (fellow Guy Ritchie alumni Jason Flemyng plays one of the baddies).<br /><br />The martial arts sequences were better in the first one (although, the fight scene where Frank takes on a bunch of thugs with a long metal pipe is very impressive) but the car chases in this movie are more impressive and greater in number. Even though Transporter 2 is slightly inferior to the original, it is still a very entertaining, highly enjoyable effort.<br /><br />There are 14 (?!) deleted and extended scenes that flesh out certain scenes including one where Frank and the boy's mother actually kiss. However, the real treat for fans are the extended versions of most of the fight scenes (which include added gore cut for the PG-13 rating) and car chases.<br /><br />Also included is a blooper reel, a making of featurette and one that focuses on the music.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I couldn't believe they even made a Transporter 2, the first one was alright but I didn't think it would get this far but I guess the rest of the world seem to enjoyed it. Now, I'm all for a good action film, but this was a little TO Hollywood for my book. If you're wanted to see this for plot, and as a realistic high standard action film, you're going to be VERY disappointed. The stunts though really cool looking, are virtually impossible to pull off -- realistically. The transporter was almost superman-like in a film that was based on a realistic present day world, and he pulled off things that SHOULD NOT and COULD NOT have happened. This is the negative side to the film, and really the plot was Mediocre at best. While watching this last night I realize there are parts which are incredibly stupid, like the character of Frank Martin and the villain fighting on an out-of-control airplane, the silly things like having the French policeman from the first film being arrested and teaching the cadets at the police station how to make fine French cuisine(??), or the fact that there's this Jamaican guy that shows up out of nowhere at the end of the movie for comedic value(???), or the fact that you can spin a car in mid-air, have the bottom of the car hit a wrecking ball, which knocks off a remote-triggered bomb that blows up after dislodging, and land the car safely(????), or the fact that there are hardly any police to be found in the city...and so on.<br /><br />Even though it's made by a European director and producer and funded with European money, something that gave the first such a unique feel, this feels an awful lot like a Hollywood trash flick. Since the end hints a third, one can only hope that Leterrier and Besson get their act together. What began as a series made in the style of Taxi, Ronin, and Kiss of the Dragon has ended up tumbling into world where movies like Stealth and SWAT lived. And that isn't good.<br /><br />Again this is an action movie with twists and turns, some believable, some not so. If you liked The Fifth Element, The Professional, Le Femme Nikita, and True Lies, this is your movie. If you grew up on Bond, Dukes, and Blade Runner, you'll love it.</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>I really liked the first movie in this series. The second one I liked, but didn't like as much as the first one. This sequel just kept to one story about a little boy that was kidnapped. This movie still holds the action of the first, but I don't think is quiet as strong as the first one. I am a person that does like sequels and likes most, but this one isn't as strong. If you are a Jason Statham fan and you like the action in movies, then I recommend this one. Remember that this sequel doesn't have the "complexity" of the first one.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Preposterous.  Totally.  Completely.  Professional "driver" and transporter Frank Martin is one awesome dude.  He can dodge bullets.  Take a jet ski over dry land (can't we all?).  Jump from one building to another in his souped-up Audi.  Even jump out a window, land on a car, and not even wrinkle the lapels of his jacket.<br /><br />And you know what?  It's darn fun to watch.  Jason Statham, as balding and as grim-faced as my accountant, reprises his role as super duper action hero Frank Martin in Louis Leterrier's TRANSPORTER 2.  After watching this sequel, it immediately and readily became apparent the makers of this film decided if they were going to make an action film, they might as well make it (the action) nonstop--and they might as well up the ante on the "Oh, wow!" scale.  And they have succeeded, as we watch brooding Frank take on a scantily-clad femme fatale (Kate Nauta is very, very wicked, you good girl), make a most curious entrance into a jet about to become airborne, and do some amazing things with a fire hose.<br /><br />Forget the plot.  (Was there even a plot?)  Alessandro Gassman is a passable villian; Matthew Modine as wimpy as usual.  Just take in the action--there's plenty of it.  TRANSPORTER 2 is a cartoon disguised as a live-action movie.  Preposterous. . .in a good way.<br /><br />--D.

He lived by three rules in the first movie and from the get-go he has abandoned the second and third rule as he chouffers a kid from school for a rich family.  He has even added a new rule in this movie.<br /><br />When the kid gets kidnapped, Frank intends on keeping his promise to keep him safe from harm.  Little does he realize what is really involved.<br /><br />Last the first movie, this one is loaded with action.  The plot is improved upon in my opinion but the acting isn't.  Francois Berleand also returns from the first film as the French detective and was the highlight of the movie for me.<br /><br />If you love action, check this film out.  Still not the best out there but it will keep you entertained for an hour and a half.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>This is one of the best action films I have seen in years.  Jason Stratham does an excellent job of improving on his character that we saw in the dismal original film and the director has made a movie that is never boring and has some of the best fight scenes I have seen in a movie ever!<br /><br />Stratham is super likable as a driver for a politician's young son.  The chemistry between the two is excellent, reminicent of Ricky Schroeder & John Voigt in The Champ.  Stratham promises the boy that he will never let anyone ever hurt him.  The audience starts to wonder if he can keep that promise after the boy is almost kidnapped and then finally kidnapped.<br /><br />Stratham makes impossible escape after another and uses some wicked fighting skills to track down the boy before something bad happens.  The beginning of the movie is reminicent of Denzel Washington's Man on Fire with Matthew Bodine playing a similar father character to Marc Anthony's character in that flick.  The difference is that in this movie, Bodine is just a bad father who has neglected his family as opposed to Anthony's evil intentions in the other flick.<br /><br />Some of the escapes will have you shaking your head but the movie is so good that you will ignore those issues.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P9D22KDEXVMN.html">A3P9D22KDEXVMN</a><br/><p>The action and fun quotient is way up in this stylish movie; all you need to do is suspend disbelief and taper your expectations if you were looking for a movie that makes you think.

If you've heard of films that are "so bad they're good," this second outing in the series might just squeeze its way into that category.  Transporter 2 isn't the worst movie ever made, but it has to be pretty close.<br /><br />Transporter 2 finds everyone's favorite rule-abiding mover of delicate goods, Frank Martin (Jason Statham), filling in as a chauffeur for the son of a powerful government official (Matthew Modine).  When young Jack (Hunter Clary) is kidnapped by a dangerous mercenary-for-hire (Alessandro Gassman), Frank must uncover the nefarious plot behind the crime, rescue the boy, and generally save the day in as outlandish a fashion as possible.<br /><br />For every well-choreographed, creative action sequence, there are five utterly ridiculous ones that truly epitomize absurdity.  An intense duel with a hulking henchman in the confined quarters of a boat make for some unique camerawork and effective combat, and a martial arts-infused fight with a fire hose steals the show for most original and entertaining action sequence.  But a dreadfully dull Tarzan-esque battle with the main villainess, unrealistic bullet dodging, and an anti-climactic airplane crash quickly rescind this action vehicle's license to thrill.  And if the majority of these scenes weren't disappointing enough, they're accompanied by awful one-liners and some of the most pitiful special effects in recent history.<br /><br />The first Transporter movie, while entertaining in its brainless adventure, was wholly unrealistic.  The second one practically redefines the word.  It's difficult to come up with enough adjectives to describe just how detestably over-the-top every aspect of the film becomes, from the abhorrent, lingerie-wearing antagonist Lola (Kate Nauta) to the badgering use of music and skewed sense of plausibility.  Frank retains his use of rules this time out, though the rules of realism have long since been lost.  At least a healthy dose of car chases, massive property destruction, and martial arts mayhem keeps Transporter 2 barely watchable.  Barely.<br /><br />- Joel Massie</p></br><a href="../users/A259F4J3QOBIUH.html">A259F4J3QOBIUH</a><br/><p>Jason Statham is a Bad A**.  This guy is amazing.

This is due to the fact that the rules of gravity are irrelevant in this sequel to the much better predecessor. Frank Martin A.K.A the transporter is back but this time he is a chauffer for a wealthy family's son, as a matter of fact a senator's son. In this movie the story is so unoriginal; everything is so similar to previous action movies. Take for example the plot revolving a lethal virus, if infected the individual will infect many others, and the only one that can stop it is the malevolent bad guy who started the virus in the first place and only he holds the anti-virus. This story is very reminiscent to that of mission impossible 2. The films plot isn't the only thing that has a problem but the action as well. As mentioned before there is no such thing as gravity in the movie. All of the fight sequences are over the top and really exaggerating. Nevertheless it is entertaining and Jason Statham gives a good performance once again but other than that it's a very inferior sequel with very little credibility.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 OUT OF 5</p></br><a href="../users/A461VTLW9G9YB.html">A461VTLW9G9YB</a><br/><p>I haven't seen the first movie yet but I watched this and I loved it.

While 2 does not aim for the character depth we got with the Asian characters, it does pack a wallop with sheer visceral punch.  Louis Leterrier moves up from the Artistic Director of the original to direct this film.  Moved to Miami, it gives the film a different look and different toys.  (Leterrier followed this film with "Unleashed" with Jet Li.)  As Frank Martin, Jason Statham shows he's a great action star.  Building on "Lock, Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels" and "The Italian Job" + a stint as the heavy in "Cellular," he shines stage center as the Transporter.  Amber Valetta from "Raising Helen" and her excellent appearance in "Hitch" does a good job as mother Audrey who puts concerns on her kidnapped son & floundering marriage.  Matthew Modine as Jefferson Billings does a journeyman's job as the emotional lightweight father/husband.  Jason Flemyng as the fake doctor Dimitri has a great character face that should result in many more film appearances in addition to "Layer Cake."  As the criminal kingpin, Alessandro Gassman, son of Vittorio Gassman, turns in a chilling performance as the ruthless criminal mastermind.  (I'd forgotten that I'd seen him in a very different role in "Steam: The Turkish Bath.")  The fight sequence with Statham on the plane is a stellar brawl.  Hunter Clary's first film as young Jack Billings shows the child actor off with a good range.  He's a cute witty kid!  Also in her freshman effort, Kate Nauta turns in the memorable performance as the amoral Lola who is comfortable in underwear, stiletto heels and a machine gun.  Perhaps the plot about a 24-hour virus is a bit improbable, but it keeps the pace of the movie running at full throttle.  This is an excellent sophomore effort.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>"I'm in need of a Transporter."<br /><br />"I'm listening." - Master Transporter, Frank Martin can hear his next customer now in "Transporter 2"<br /><br />Decent sequel to the "Transporter" has Frank Martin doing a favor for a friend by watching over a Senator's young son. But, when the boy is kidnapped by terrorists The Transporter puts it into overdrive to retrieve the boy & take out the terrorists. Things get worse when Frank finds out that the boy has been injected with a deadly virus that kills everyone that comes in contact with him. Frank has less than 4 hours to retrieve the antidote & stop the spread of the disease. Good luck.<br /><br />The film is just about non-stop action with the usual intercuts of the family going through the worried argueing phase, while the cops try to formulate a plan.<br /><br />The film has a few flaws. The CGI action is terrible. Leading to a lot of "Yeah, right!" sequences that almost sink the film entirely. Jason Statham is great as the transporter & holds the film together.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>Frank Martin is someone you definitely would want on the school-carpool rotation.<br /><br />He's punctual, he loves kids and he handles a car in ways to suggest he invented the phrase, "Professional driver on a closed course; do not attempt."<br /><br />When Frank slips behind the wheel, The Transporter 2 races along at 200 mph, the turbo-charged Audi sedan expressing more personality than much of the cast. But when the action gives way to plot, the movie slows to a rush-hour crawl and you're hoping Frank either gets back into the car or walks into a dark alley to face a dozen thugs, whom he will keenly dispatch with his editing-room-enhanced martial-arts skills. Jason Statham reprises his role from the 2002 original as Frank, a professional transporter (like the FedEx guy, only he absolutely, positively gets it there, thanks to high-speed pursuits). Now he's in charge of ferrying 6-year-old Jack to school and back.<br /><br />The problem is that Jack's father Mr. Billings (Matthew Modine) is a federal drug czar whose policies have angered several drug cartels. Though an army of men as well-armed as they are dressed surround Billings, Frank and Jack tool around the streets of Miami by themselves. So when Frank accompanies Jack to the doctor on a Saturday (talk about far-fetched), everyone but those in the security detail know this isn't going to go well.<br /><br />Frank repels the initial attack but the fates, and the bad guys, catch up. The ensuing car chase is the movie's set piece, a dazzling automotive ballet of spinning, twisting and careening vehicles, Swan Lake interpreted by NASCAR.<br /><br />Jack eventually is kidnapped, and Frank is determined to get him back, no matter how many cars are crashed or faces pummeled.<br /><br />Set designers must have been giddy while preparing a room for one of the several 10-on-Frank fights. Frank uses every prop at his disposal, including chairs, tables, pipes, ladders and, in the most inventive showdown, a fire hose.<br /><br />Villainous combatants closely adhere to Hollywood's fight-sequence rules, attacking Jack one at a time. Not sure how the order was determined. Perhaps it was weakest to strongest, or they simply drew straws.<br /><br />If the plot missteps, it's when it abandons its live-action-cartoon intentions to put a 6-year-old boy in grave peril, as Jack is injected with a lethal serum (leaving Frank to seek the antidote). It seems out of place in a film whose entertainment value is based solely on outlandish stunts.<br /><br />Transporter 2 is high-octane fluff, a feature-length car commercial on steroids that never tries, or pretends to be, anything more. At that level it works. And with gasoline at $3 a gallon and more, enjoy it as an indulgent fantasy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>After seeing, and loving, the first Transporter film I had to see the second one and so I took my brother-in-law who was syked and we went opening night.  Besides ONE scene, this film was awsome and lived up to it's name.  The story revolves around our returning hero Frank Martin (Jason Statham) who is now choufer for a young boy whoes mother played by the beautiful Amber Valetta is going through a rough marraige and is starting to take a liking to Frank.  This spirals when her son is kidnapped while in Frank's custody and he is blamed for his disaperance.  The boy was kidnapped by this international terrorist type guy played by Alessandro Gassman and for the record, the guy is not French, he is Italian.  Anyways...it's his girlfriend who is the real trouble...played by Kate Nauta she plays a lethal killing machine wearing nothing but her underwear and strapped with some uzzies she proves a formidable threat.  The fight sequences in the film were expertly choreographed by Corey Yuen and they prove enough to satisfy the fan...but there is one drawback...and that is the whole premise of the final fight scene.  It's just way too CGI and choppy and SOOOOOOO increadibly fake looking.  BUT as my title states, DON'T TAKE THIS MOVIE SO SERIOUS!  It's not ment to be.  Laugh a little at the rediculous conclusion but smile as you watch Frank kick serious @$$ and thats the great part about this movie...Jason Statham has moves.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Luc Besson and Louis Leterrier created such a terrific action thriller with THE TRANSPORTER in 2002, giving Jason Statham the opportunity to create a man of crime so clever and dignified that the film was an instant success.  And so what does that mean in movieland? If a little is good, a lot is better.  Wrong!  As is often the case with sequels the intial creative bite gets diluted as though success of the original will carry the sequel without much work.  In the case of TRANSPORTER 2 the story and supporting cast border on the ridiculous, but if you're watching the film just to see Jason Statham in action, then you'll be satisfied.<br /><br />The appealing aspect of Transporter 1 was the setting  - the French Riviera that served as a gorgeous background for all the derring-do of a top-notch cast.  Now in Miami, in a role far less interesting than the original plot of Transporter 1, the film strains credibility and that detracts from the thrills.  But the good news is that Jason Statham is intact and as fascinating and dexterous as ever.  You just have to settle for that  (which is a lot) and the movie will satisfy.  Let's hope they don't make Statham consider a T 3.  Grady Harp, January 06</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>This movie was entertaining as can be.

Jason Statham returns as Frank Martin, an expert driver who is on a different sort of job these days.  As a favor, he's escorting the son of a wealthy couple (Matthew Modine, Amber Valletta) who soon becomes the target of a supplier (Alessandro Gassman) who has a dangerous virus at his disposal.  Transporter 2 features even less character development this time around, not to mention even more unbelievable physics and some ridiculous action scenes involving Frank and his car to boot.  Not to mention a female assassin (Kate Nauta) who frequently works in her bra and panties.  Yeah, but despite what all the film has going against it, Transporter 2 manages to be enjoyable throughout it's running time even though a majority of it is completely idiotic.  This is because of Statham's scowly charisma, as well as the fact that nothing about this film is taken seriously.  All in all, if you enjoyed the first film, chances are that you'll probably dig this.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Transporter 2" is great!

He usually takes dangerous delivery jobs that others are unable or afraid to do. He drives an armored vehicle. However, in this film, he agrees to substitute for a friend who can't drive a youngster from place to place. He and the boy bond. He promises the child that he would make sure that he is never hurt. Very soon he has to use his skills and fulfill his promise when the boy is kidnapped.<br /><br /> The film is filled with action. There are many chases, by speed boat, cars, and foot, among others, including one where he rushes a plane while driving in a car. There are many fights; several where the transporter battles about a dozen armed men while he is unarmed and alone, and a fight with a woman. There is humor in the film, as when the boy's mother, who likes him, says, "I didn't know that you had a friend." He replies, "He's no friend. He's French." This Frenchman plays a part in the movie and adds humor.<br /><br /> The film is filled with suspense. Why is the boy kidnapped? Why is his father so distant from him? Will the relationship between his father and mother be resolved? Can the transporter rescue the boy? Can he save the people who the kidnappers want to hurt? People who enjoy action films will really delight in this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UNMXBJSVIXFB.html">A2UNMXBJSVIXFB</a><br/><p>Movie - 4.0<br /><br />Continuing somewhat where we left off in the first Transporter movie, we get much of the same, albeit, in Miami instead of France. Frank Martin still looks cool in a suit, drives a really fast car, and kicks a lot of butt with his Cory Yuen-choreographed martial arts. But what gets more of a giggle from me in this one is the cheesy, over-the-top humor. On occasion they make references to the last movie with the Rules gimmick, Tarconi claiming to be "the cook," and the rest of Martin's other mannerisms/quirks. It sort of reminds of Shoot 'Em Up, only without the hard R-rated violence and raunchiness. With that said, I actually like the film a lot more than I used to. Having seen it 4 times now at the moment of this writing, the movie seems to have grown on me after deciding to keep the franchise in the B-movie category. It's somewhat serious, yet obviously silly, but still manages to keep me entertained for some reason. In particular, I really like the Chellini character. Alessandro Gassman reminds me a lot of Benicio Del Toro, and I think he does a really good job being a sly, Colombian, crooked-teeth antithesis to Statham. The film itself is really short, which makes a lot of the action progress very smoothly. I didn't care for the melodramatic reunion between the mom and her son, as it feels a bit awkward and dampening to the pace, and I think they used a little too much CG for some of the more implausible action sequences. But other than that, I still think the movie is entertaining enough for 80-ish minutes and serves as a nice action/thriller escapist fantasy to stimulate the imagination. Props also to the cinematography and some very nice camera angles for all the Kung-fu and stunt work.<br /><br />Video - 4.0<br /><br />Although using the same antiquated MPEG-2 encode, Transporter 2 looks very good compared to its predecessor. Colors are vibrant, maybe even a tad bit over-saturated in the flesh tones department, but worthy of mention despite the setback. Sharpness and textures are also much-improved revealing a great amount of detail in overall picture quality and giving the fore/background a lot of depth and dimensionality. Black levels are excellent and do a good job in delineation between shadows and clothing for the most part. Contrast never feels too bright or too low and serves the sleek photography well. As skeptical as I am of BDs that still use MPEG-2, this is actually very presentable and I'm glad it at least looks this good. Given that it's Fox and that the fan base of the Transporter franchise probably won't warrant a remaster in a more advanced codec anytime soon, this is probably as good as the movie will ever look outside of an import (so send me a message if you find a better encode for the first two movies).<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Thankfully, lossless audio is the same any way you present it, regardless of old or new video encodes. The DTS-HD 5.1 track for this film is reference-quality. Specifically, I love the way it zones out any kind of background noise/music and focuses solely on the hits, whacks, and crunches in the scene where Statham is fighting the goons and henchmen. The clanking of metal, the crack of the fire hose, the thud of bodies being smacked around and falling to the floor; it's a pretty exhilarating experience that fits the sound design admirably. And that's not even including how great the car chase and gunfire effects are. High and low ends are reproduced perfectly from the suppressed Glock 18Cs to the revving of the Audi A8L W12. Dialogue is clear through the center, while directionality and separation are handled aptly within the front and rear sides. Music is immersive, but never overpowering, and LFEs have a nice subtlety to them when they're around. Despite the cheese and suspension of disbelief required for this movie, don't be afraid to showcase this audio treat.<br /><br />Extras - 0.5<br /><br />Sadly, there's nothing but trailers.<br /><br />Overall - 3.5<br /><br />The movie is ridiculous in terms of highly-exaggerated action sequences and a very simplistic "narrative." But if you liked the first Transporter and don't mind a little more cheese on top of your cheese, then this movie just might manage to entertain you for about an hour and a half. The video's not quite as good as it could be, but the audio is fantastic. There aren't any extra features either, not that it would really benefit, though I am a sucker for good making-ofs. With the current SRP being cheaper than most DVDs, why not take a seat, buckle up, and give it a spin?</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>This was a good story with non-stop action.

This movie did exactly what the "Transporter" Means.</p></br><a href="../users/A26R4PDCZX5SOK.html">A26R4PDCZX5SOK</a><br/><p>5 of 5 stars for the Transporter 2 is the best of the three movies in this series. It continues to follow Frank Martin but with all new story and chaacters. Great action in this movie. I specially liked the opening scene with the attempted car-jackin...g of Frank's car; a bad idea. Also of note is how they saved money on the costumes for the lead bad-girl; only Victoria's Secret. This is a must see movie!</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>The important question is whether or not you liked the first "Transporter".  If you did, and can put up with a bit too much emphasis on the vehicles, you will probably like this movie.  It is light entertainment and has its own quirky style.  For me, Jason Statham has a just right approach to the very serious and obsessively precise man.  He is very skilled at violence, and so skilled that even while everyone is trying to kill him he does his level best to use the exact minimum level of violence to achieve his purposes.  Really, he would just rather be driving his perfectly detailed car with every detail of the trip executed perfectly - to at least two decimal places of precision.  If, like me, you find this idea a bit humorous and attractive, this movie is for you.<br /><br />Both of the movies played off providing a human interest for this lonely, solitary man.  In the first it was a romantic interest.  Here it is a more dangerous choice of a child.  Kids can make or break movies.  Here it is more the idea of the kid.  He is charming enough when he is on screen, but he really has a small part in the movie.<br /><br />The fight scenes play on the same types of kicks, spins, and gimmicks of the first movie, but does find fresh ways to use them including a pretty funny bit with a yacht in dry dock.  There are a few scenes that are just ridiculously over the top - you saw a couple of them in the trailers - I think one of the producers who popped for a bigger budget decided that the car was a star and wanted to do some uhmazzin things with it.  Really, the special driving in the chase scenes is enough.  We don't need to see the stupid car flying hundreds of feet from a skyscraper into an open floor across a wide street and land at an impossible angle.  Nor do we need to see the car roll and use a crane to just perfectly knock a bomb off the bottom of the car.  Oh, and just like you can't survive a falling elevator by jumping up, you can't survive a plane crashing into the ocean at 200 mph by throwing yourself towards the back of the plane.  Sheesh.<br /><br />Still, quite a bit of fun.  And I enjoyed the visiting French detective.  He added another nice touch.  It was also nice to see Matthew Modine on screen.  The villain was OK, but nothing really developed out of his early martial arts training scene.  Enjoy the movie.  Just don't think too hard.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>Jason Statham is perhaps the coolest guy in action movies today, and is a gritty and compelling (anti-)hero, even in this, a movie that might as well be written for Jackie Chan.<br /><br />And that's the problem with Transporter 2: Where the original had a European flavor unfamiliar to American audiences, and fights that, although clever, mostly made audience's teeth ache in sympathy, the sequel is lightweight, silly and it even has a cute kid.<br /><br />Statham looks lost here, among the lame jokes and bad CGI effects. If there's a third Transporter, hopefully it will get back to the cross-country, bone-crunching, somewhat edgy tone of the original.<br /><br />A rental for fans of the original, but nothing more.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>I am the first to admit that I am not the target viewer for this film, as it serves up crash-and-burn car chases, blood-splattering shootouts, cartoonish "Kill Bill"-inspired martial arts fight scenes and a stoic, vigilante hero. None of the contrived premise of this 2005 action thriller is original, but the rapid-fire and thoroughly preposterous execution should satisfy fans of the genre. It all focuses on unflappable Frank Martin working temporarily as the chauffeur for the son of a rising US government drug czar. Of course, the kid is the target of a kidnapping by a nasty drug lord and his gang of thugs, including a bloodless supermodel killer who looks like pop singer Pink's bodybuilding sister. The plot kicks into high gear with a by-the-numbers "deadly virus" angle which conveniently kills anyone within breathing distance from the infected. Your eyes will be rolling throughout, especially the downed plane toward the end, though what barely saves the film is a sense of humor about Martin's anal-retentive nature and super-human dexterity.<br /><br />I think the film could have benefited from more blatant comedy, but sadly director Louis Leterrier and screenwriters Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen seem to take the ridiculous plotline pretty seriously. Jason Statham returns to the title role in this sequel, and he handles the athleticism and Clint Eastwood-like speech mannerisms to the presumed requirements of the role. Alessandro Gassman is appropriately greasy as drug lord Gianni, while supermodel Amber Valletta actually has some credibility as the mother of the kidnapped boy who unsurprisingly becomes drawn to Frank. On the other hand, Kate Nauta plays the supermodel killer as if reading cue cards. Although I like Fran?ois Berl&eacute;and as Frank's cop friend, he feels merely like a convenient plot device, and I was disappointed to see Matthew Modine, apparently in a career downshift, playing the drug czar in such a predictable manner. There is a standard making-of featurette with the DVD, as well as a fitfully amusing blooper reel. I have to give the filmmakers credit for earning a PG-13 rating for all the implied violence they provide here.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SYMLB8JSW5VD.html">A3SYMLB8JSW5VD</a><br/><p>This movie is much better because it had what the first movie didn't have. A more sensible plot, better actors&actresses and better acting. This time, The Transporter acts as chaffeur to a rich couple's son who he adores. The when the son is kidnapped that is when the real fun begins. Plenty of action and martial arts. If you hated the first movie this will turn you around.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>This happens rarely in film, but The Transporter 2 is much more focused and tighter than the original, which I also liked. Move over James Bond, because Jason Statham returns here as the ultra cool Frank Martin. What Bond does with guns and gadgets, Frank Martin does physically with his body and various appliances that may be lying around. The creative fight scenes are on par with the original with my favorite being the one with fire hose towards the end. I must admit that the whole plane scene contains some of the worst CGI I have ever seen and it nearly ruins that part of the movie. Like the 007 films, leave logic and realism at the door, so you can just enjoy the ride that The Transporter 2 takes you on.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>Jason Statham returns again as the cool transporter, this time involved in a less dangerous transporting business - the driver for a wealthy and famous Miami family.  The action and choreography are still as cool as the beautiful scenes of Miami, but the characters and CGI useage hurt this sequal just a tad, thus making it slightly less entertaining than the first Transporter.<br /><br />So on the positive note, Jason Statham is still wonderful in this sequal, fun to watch, and just down right cool to say the least.  The action scenes are fun, and there is still some martial arts to please.  The story is inetersting - at times - and the cinematogrpahy of beautiful Miami makes one want to starting earning the bucks to live in such a gorgeous place.<br /><br />On the down side, the charcaters - especially the villains - are not nearly as enjoyable as the first film.  The boss is rather average, but its his ridiculously skinny girl, who's always in the heat of action, that is somewhat distracting and not in a pleasant manner, despite her skimpy outfits.  The CGI, which was rarely used in the 1st film, is more abundant this time, and is very obvious when used.  Some of the action scenes are so wild, only CGI could be used to execute them.  Unfortunately, they look too fake at times, especially they airplane which just happens to be the climax scene of the film.  It was cool to see Frank (Jason Statham) and the bad guy fight it out inside a plane that was doing loopies, but it also ment no cool choreography for this final fight.  Fortunately, there are some other scenes in the film that show off Corey Yuen's great choreographing.<br /><br />Overall, a good action film that will succed in action entertainment, but don't expect a "great" action film.  Jason Statham is the best part of Transporter 2, the rest is average.  3-1/2 stars overall.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>My most significant complaint regarding the original "Transporter" was that Jason Statham's Frank Martin did not do as much fancy driving as his job title would suggest.  I am happy to report that deficiency has been rectified in the 2005 sequel.  The title character still gets to punch and kick people in creative ways in "Transporter 2," but he also gets several chances to get behind the wheel of his big black Audi Cobra and floor that baby.  Originally I was hoping for car stunts in the great tradition of Steve McQueen, that is to say the sort of things you really can do with a car, but this movie decides to follow the James Bond tradition where the impossible is made possible and you just smile and go along for the ride.<br /><br />What we know about the Transporter is that he plays by his own rules and he is deadly serious about keeping them.  You make a contract with him and he lives up to his side of the deal.  Martin is the best at what he does and you need a lot of money to hire him, so imagine our surprise when we learn his precious cargo in this film is a young boy, Jack Billings (Hunter Clary).  The boy's father, Jackson (Matthew Modine) is the new head of the U.S. narcotics agency and his other, Audrey (Amber Valletta), is now sleeping with Frank.  I am not sure how anybody came up with Frank's fee to be a chauffer to a young boy, but of course he has promised the boy that nothing bad will happen to him, so you can anticipate where this one is going.<br /><br />But Jack is the target of more than a kidnapping plot, and while Frank takes way too long to figure out there is not something right at the doctor's office, I certainly do not blame him for taking a while to figure out the plan with plans in this one.  That is because the bad guy behind what is going on, Gianni (Alessandro Gassman), is pretty sharp for a villain, once you get past the standard mistake of not killing the hero as soon as you can and instead talking too mcuh.  But before Frank can get to Gianni, he has to go through the ultra violent Lola (Kate Nauta), who has the high heels, the tattoo on the inner thigh, and the big guns to hold her own against Frank.  Not that they stand a chance in the end, but they clearly are going to put up a decent fight before the end.  The screenplay by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen comes up with a solid series of set pieces to tie the plot together for director Louis Leterrier, who is also back for the second go round.<br /><br />Statham's Frank Martin broods a lot and you can see how he combines the laconic nature of Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name/Dirty Harry with the outfits and gadgets of the James Bond of your choice.  Substituting action for one-liners certainly meets with my approval because then you do not have to worry about lame jokes.  Instead the laughs generated by this film are going to stem from such unlikely bits as Frank stabbing a bad guy with the leg of a chair (and an unbroken chair at that) or finding an odd way to break another henchman's arm.  The one liners, such as they are, belong to the comic relief character here and the only other familiar face from the original film, Francois Berleand, who is back as Tarconi, only instead of checking on Frank's possible criminal activity and always being a step or two behind, this time he is visiting Miami on his vacation and taking issue with the local cuisine.  This allows Frank to have somebody on the inside, along with Audrey, once Jackson and the police make the mistaken assumption he is in on the kidnapping.  More importantly, it allows Frank to get behind the wheel of a car and do what he does best.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCPMT1RRS7K0.html">A1VCPMT1RRS7K0</a><br/><p>The true draw of this film is very simply the action.  There are great action and fight sequences from beginning to end, with no drawn-out lulls in between.  The plot isn't all that great.  As a matter of fact, it's quite formulaic, as there is an all-too-common band of criminals with a plan that's setup for the hero to foil.  Yet it is done well in this movie.  The budget seems to be larger than that of the first film, making for more action and larger stunts.<br /><br />This is a good movie - definitely worth watching, especially for action fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>"Transporter 2" was absolutely awesome!!! I never thought it'd be as good as it was. Almost as if you combind James Bond and an old school Jackie Chan movie into one hell of an action exciting film! The phenomenal yet totally off the wall action stunts got me right into the movie. It's definitely Jason Statham's movie that will make well known like Arnold Swarzenegger. Jason Statham will become the next action star.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Set your brain on park and get set to enjoy the further exploits of Frank Martin, the taciturn but very capable driver/transporter. In this sequel, Frank (Jason Statham) does a favor for a friend and agrees to chauffer around a young kid of a wealthy family  for a month. During that time, he grows fond of the boy and his attractive mother (Amber Valletta), which doesn't bode well for the hired thugs who kidnap the lad. The bad guys are formidable, the most deadly of whom are an imposing muscleman (Shannon Briggs), a beautiful but deranged and trigger-happy woman (Kate Nauta), and their vicious leader, the unscrupulous Gianni (Alessandro Gassman). But, this time, they picked the wrong victim to mess with when they chose someone under the care of the Transporter.<br /><br />This sequel, set in colorful Miami, is better than the first film. The plot is simple, even if the villain's master scheme is a bit convoluted, involving a kidnapping, a 24-hour virus, and the boy's father infecting the delegates of a drug enforcement conference. There's even a tiny, tiny subplot about the attraction between Frank and the boy's hot mom. But make no mistake,  this movie is all about Frank Martin and his talent to brutally kick heinie.<br /><br />The stunts are preposterous but very entertaining in their implausibility. In fact, the over-the-top outrageousness of the stunts is one of the things I appreciated about the film. The film makers wholeheartedly went for it. The manner in which Frank disposes of the car bomb, the ridiculousness of the vehicular stunts (especially early on, involving the police), and the eye-popping martial arts flavored fight scenes overwhelmed me to the point where I just relaxed, gave in, and then really got into the whole nutsy premise.<br /><br />Jason Statham, with his no-nonsense look and curt British accent, is impressive. Often, during the film, I noticed men in his vicinity who seemed to be taller than he was, but this, in no way, diminishes his character's aura of invincibility. He brings his natural grace, athleticism, and a personalized fighting style to his role as he Jackie Chans his way thru the baddies, utilizing as weapons various furnitures, fire extinguishers, and one very effective water hose nozzle. It's worth mentioning that Statham does the brunt of his stunts here.<br /><br />The supporting cast is serviceable. Beautiful Amber Valletta as the lonely mother is in that thankless role of looking anguished and tormented for most of the movie. Matthew Modine blandly blends in the background as the work-obsessed husband who likes to  disparage his wife. Even the lead villain Alessandro Gassman doesn't contribute much except for some token gestures and words of menace. Shannon Briggs needs to stick with boxing and go for a heavyweight title soon. Francois Berleand returns as the policeman Tarconi but is cast in the flick only to serve as a deux-ex-machina within the Miami police department and feed Frank precious info. I felt he was wasted here. The two supporting standouts are Kate Nauta as the psychologically unstable killer chick who stalks around in her scanties as she blazes her laser-designated weaponry with the contrail effects. Now, she's fun to watch in all her hot insanity. Hunter Clary as the boy Jack is endearing, and it's too bad he only has several scenes, the bulk of which is early in the film.<br /><br />Side A of the disc contains the full-screen version as well as these extra features: the 4 minute long "Making of Transporter 2" featurette, a 10 minute long "Making the Music" (film soundtrack) featurette, and a brief bloopers reel, and if you press the Inside Look button on the main menu, there's a cool trailer for the upcoming Night Watch movie. Side B has the widescreen version, as well as 4 extended and 3 deleted scenes.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the first Transporter, you'll love Transporter 2. It's 87 minutes of mindless, ridiculous fun. It won't change the world for the better, but, at least, it's 87 minutes that you won't wish you had back. And if you love Transporter 2, then you gotta check out Crank. Now I'm off to see how much an Audi A8L W12 costs. I'm tired of my Mercury Topaz.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>According the last canons of how to make a movie beat your senses, you have everything you want in this movie; car chases, aquatic motorcycle, waterspout martial acrobatics in the great tradition of the last entries of the last James Bond. Do not try to scratch too much beneath this hard to believe script; it is quite primary and even elemental, but who really cares about it? . You want action and good fun and here you have it; this sequel has a a lot of emotion and audacious effects; a true feast for your eyes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>I dont understand how people cannot enjoy this movie. I mean sure, Transporter 2 isnt an epic three hour movie, no Oscar winning acting and dialouge, and no big stars. So whats the appeal to this? Its just a fun, action packed movie. The movie packs mostly everything you can think of within 90 minutes. The action is awesome, and Jason Statham does an amazing job as Frank. They set up a part three, and I'm excited to see what happens. Highly recommend this movie if you like a good action flick, you wont be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>Jason Statham returns to the role of Frank Martin, a professional "driver" with exceptional fighting skills, only this time he is on a routine baby sitting job for the Son of Senator Billings (Matthew Modine). In time honored fashion there is an attempt to kidnap the boy, but this is just the tip of a hair brained plot by arch villian Gianni, working freelance for Columbian drug lords. A toxic virus, drugs, money, murder and pretty much any other nefarious activity are at the top of his agenda, and the only man standing in his way is (you guessed it) Frank Martin. As usual the police, FBI et al are on the case, and totally useless, and Frank must use all his skills to save the day. That's about it really - this is NOT a movie that will test your intellect, or I suspect top any drama awards lists, but if you accept that going in, you'll have fun. The action is thick and fast, and some of the stuntwork and fight choreography under the watchful eye of the talented Cory Yuen (director of the first Transporter movie)is amazing. There is some comic relief along the way from Francois Berleand as Tarconi (the French Police chief from the last movie also) supposedly visiting Frank in Miami on vacation, and a few other familiar faces pop up in this Euro muscle flexing exercise. A lot of people have been damning of the lack of character development, often wooden supporting performances, and ridiculous aspects of some action sequences, but I would ask them "What did you expect?" - Statham carries the role very well, with a brooding but calm confidence, and arguably gives away some of the limelight to his Audi A8 W12 car, which steals many scenes in some amazing car chases. Pure escapism at it's best, Director Louis Letterier delivers Bessons script in a punchy unpretentious way and the end result certainly leaves this movie head and shoulders above similar releases, like XXX State of the Union for example. Wonderful Miami backdrops finish off the eye candy, and a psychotic, sexy she villian is also thrown in for good measure. Go on, indulge yourself and pass the popcorn. Enjoy!</p></br></body></html>

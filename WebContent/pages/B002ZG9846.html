The action, blood letting and witty dialogue never stop in this violent but funny superhero-on-steriod film starring Nicolas Cage (Big Daddy), Mark Strong (Kick-Ass) and the real star Chloe Moretz (Hit Girl). With great performances from Cage and Moretz trashing the bad guys has never been more fun. It's definitely not the brand of superheroes and caped crusaders I grew up with but once I got over the initial shock I was good to go!<br /><br />You might want to keep small children from viewing this one, at least until you've seen it yourself and are able to make an informed decision. In the meantime I'm ready to watch it again!</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>I caught this on netflix, and have to say I was taken by surprise.  I was expecting a kid's superhero movie, but this sure isn't that.  Sure, it's a bit campy, but that's what's going to make this a classic in a few years.  I'm not going to give too much away.  This is a violent action film, and it's all about Hit Girl.... watch and you'll see.<br /><br />And Kick Ass, well he does... in a final act of redemption.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>There are a lot of live action comic book movies out there.  Some, like Nolan's Batman movies are deadly serious epics about ethics, corruption, organized crime, etc...  Others, like the Spider-Man franchise with Tobey Maguire, and the Batman movies of Tim Burton, incorporate some humor via dialog and action.  Then there those like Iron Man where the main character itself provides the comedy by trying to be funny in the movie.  But never has there been an absolutely outrageous and hilarious comic-book movie like Kick-Ass.  From start to finish this movie is loaded with laughs of all sorts.  From slapstick action scenes to sarcastic dialog to ludicrous outfits, all accompanied by fast-paced music, this is the funniest comic book movie I have ever seen, and one of the funniest movies released in 2010.  But don't take your children to watch it.  This movie earned its "R" rating on many counts.  With bad language, some nudity, and a lot of bloody violence, this movie, which features more children than most movies, is certainly adults only.<br /><br />For those wanting to know what this movie resembles, I would answer "Kill Bill".  Both Kill Bill and Kick-Ass are titled after a male character in the movie, even though the principle character in both movies is female.  In the latter case, it is a pre-teenage girl.  In both Kill Bill and Kick-Ass, it is the female character that has the most action scenes, and the most kills.  And in both movies, most of the main characters have nicknames.  Other common threads are the excessive violence, large body count, gritty action, iconic musical score comprised of pop hits, and the theme of revenge flowing throughout.  Kick-Ass came in the same general time frame as other comedy movies about average people trying to become superheroes, movies such as Super and Defendor.  A sequel is in the works, so it looks like we have a new genre of not-so-superhero movies coming to Hollywood.  Overall, a great movie; and my vote for best comic-book movie of 2010.</p></br><a href="../users/A8G9GETA2OLMZ.html">A8G9GETA2OLMZ</a><br/><p>"Kick Ass" is a spoof of superhero movies, but a very affectionate spoof.<br /><br />It's got a shocking amount of blood, shocking language, and at least one actor that verges on child-porn, at least in the eyes of some.<br /><br />But it's great.<br /><br />Very well written, has interesting characters (even the villains, who are cliches, are interesting), and a wildly skewed take on everything from teen nerdiness to who's really the baddest ass.<br /><br />And of course, best of all, the baddest of the very badasses is a skinny little 10-year-old girl with a purple wig.</p></br><a href="../users/ARYSE5JQ3AG7L.html">ARYSE5JQ3AG7L</a><br/><p>Hit Girl steals the show, but it's the story about dweebs that keeps it flowing.<br />If there weren't such pitiful characters, Big Daddy & Hit Girl wouldn't be larger than life.<br /><br />The story revolves about dweebs trying to survive while the sub-plot unravels twirling all into hell unleashed.<br /><br />What comes around goes around, & James Bond would be jealous of all the weapons, especially the last one.<br /><br />Good for a few all out laughs ...<br />;)</p></br><a href="../users/A24IJY3V0804WJ.html">A24IJY3V0804WJ</a><br/><p>A teenager dreams of becoming a superhero. In his quest he makes unlikely friends, takes on big foes but ultimately fulfils his dreams with the aid of other superheroes.<br />In short, this is a very enjoyable and comical movie with excellent direction. The movie's real star is the little girl played by Chloe Moretz. A lot of viewers have found her character and dialogue objectionable for an eleven year old, including the profanity but this is a movie and in my opinion should not be taken seriously. I loved the movie and cannot wait to see the second part. 10/14/10</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>"Kick-Ass" engaged me from first frame to last.  Reading some of the more negative reviews the resevations about this film seem to center on the use of a preteen (Chloe Grace Moretz) in violent and profane situations.  This debate has been going on since "The Exorcist" and "Taxi Driver" in the Seventies and this argument will go on forever.  Regardless, I love this movie because it gives a jump start to a moribund genre, the comic book movie.  Director Matthew Vaughan has concocted something fresh, funny, original, and action packed.  Aaron Johnson is fine as Dave/Kick-Ass but everyone knows this is Moretz's vehicle.  Whenever she's on screen the energy level of the film rises appreciably.  Moretz's work here suggests a young Jodie Foster in the aforementioned "Taxi Driver".  Christopher Mintz-Plasse's star continues to rise after his memorable turn as McLovin in "Superbad".  If memory serves the film did OK but not great box office.  A sequel is alluded to at the end of the film so I hope "KIck-Ass" developes enough of a cult following so that comes to fruition.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>Awesome.  Absolutely awesome.  It helps if you understand the comic book mythology but even if you don't it should still be enjoyable.  I loved how the kid tried to become a first hero and totally epic failed his first time.  It was so horrible.  Heh.  There's a good mix of humor, tension and action in this picture.  Hit-Girl, the 11 year old, takes everything to a new level.  Based on a comic book series.  WHEN WATCHED: 09/18/2010; MY GRADE: A minus to A (non comic book fans will give it lower).</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>Mixed reviews did not bode well for this terrific little gem that lives up to the graphic novel and delivers an unvarnished, unfiltered take on the whole super hero syndrome in life and art.  Profane and violent, here's what happens when you don a mail-order wetsuit and set out to fight crime.  It gets painful and bloody fast as certain death beckons.  And then you are saved by Big Daddy and Hit Girl -- a disturbed comic artist father, and adolescent daughter who are fearless, crazier than you and superbly trained in lethal martial arts.  Good and evil have their showdown in a satisfying battle that for once lives up to the title.  No doubt there's meaning here, but I'm still working it out.  Not for all tastes.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>MILD SPOILERS<br /><br />...And that line was spoken by the eleven year old superheroine of this film. KICK-ASS is a cornball classic that is definitely headed for a kind of immortality as a camp set-up of BATMAN and SPIDER-MAN. It's the story of ordinary Dave Lizewsky of Queens NY, who one day decides to take up the job of local superhero for lack of any other ambitions.<br /><br />Dave has problems being a superhero. Unlike Peter Parker/Spider-Man he has no unnatural super powers (except "being invisible to girls"); he lacks the technological skills of Tony Stark/Ironman; and he has no millions to spend on creating a persona like Bruce Wayne/Batman. Instead, he buys a lime green wetsuit and mask from a sporting goods store, arms himself with a couple of wooden batons which he can barely hold, and names himself "Kick-Ass." He's strictly a bargain-bin superhero.<br /><br />His first "assignment" is to rescue a cat ("Mr. Bitey") from a tree; he falls out and concusses himself. In his second assignment he tries to stop two punks from breaking into a car. They throw him a beating and stab him in the gut. While he's crawling away from the fight he gets struck by a hit and run driver.<br /><br />The run-down is serendipitous. Rendered largely neuropathic from the accident, he feels little pain, and most of his bones are replaced with titanium plates and rods. When he recovers, he goes back to getting a beating for crime, this time trying to break up a street fight. It's a draw, but someone posts the video online, and overnight, Kick-Ass becomes a folk hero for tryng to save the victim.<br /><br />What nobody knows is that two real superheroes, "Big Daddy" (in a Batman-like costume) and his sass-mouthed, weapons-qualified preteen daughter "Hit Girl" (think a four-foot Robin with purple hair) are terrorizing a gang of mobsters.<br /><br />In the meantime, Kick-Ass is reveling in his fame and enjoying his sweet new girlfriend. What he doesn't know is that the mobsters think he is the superhero who has been tormenting them. They try to lure him out by baiting him with a possible sidekick "Red Mist" (the superheroic names in this movie are intentionally lame), and this leads to the grand battle between Kick-Ass, Big Daddy, and Hit Girl on one side and Red Mist and the mobsters on the other.<br /><br />By far the best character is not Kick-Ass himself, but Hit Girl. One 17 year old character announces his plan to save himself for her; a reviewer says he wants to adopt her. Noble sentiments all.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>A young man, Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) notices that there are no real super heroes and wonders why more people do not try. Therefore, he orders himself a standard superhero suit becoming Kick-Ass and is carried away in his fantasy.  He barely escapes the first hero attempt and to satisfy the girl of his dreams, asks for more.  He is in over his head and as luck would have, he is spared his fate by the intervention of a real superhero, Hit-Girl (Chlo? Grace Moretz) and her Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage.)<br /><br />I have to admit that I never read the comic. I am sure that there is the standard mix of people that like or dislike the differences. However, this film can stand on its own as fun entertainment.  I especially like the nonchalant attitude of the Mindy Macready character as she casually dispatches bad guys and evil doers.<br /><br />This is well suited for the Blu-ray experience.<br /><br />Be sure to look at the DVD extras. In one of the documentaries, they note that hit girl is dressed in a standard student uniform. Until I saw this documentary, I never thought of the fact that it was not meant to be sexy but imply that she was a poor lost child. Yet now when I look back at it I can see how it could be misinterpreted. Look for yourself and see what you think.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>Most reviews in the press warned about some kind of ultraviolent, slice-and-dice flick. I was worried. But it's nowhere near as violent as, say, Kill Bill. Not many limbs getting hacked off. Nothing particularly disturbing, although there's implied violence such as a finger getting cut off. It's par for the course for any shoot-em-up these days. No bones breaking and poking through. So what's the real reason for their discomfort?<br /><br />Well, you do have a 10 or 11-year old girl mouthing obscenities. It is a little disturbing, but it's not plentiful, and it is within character - she's been trained by her ex-policeman Big Daddy. So yes, I wouldn't let kids watch this. She does plant blades and bullets into many baddies, but from the reviews I had expected her to routinely slice them in half. There's nary a beheading.<br /><br />It's a tale of ordinary folk trying to be superheroes. One doesn't do so well because he has no super powers to speak of - well, none of them do; Hit Girl and her dad do OK because of rigorous training. Kick Ass gets his ass kicked, though not as brutally as I was led to believe. Well, it's still painful. And there's a bittersweet friendship story in there as well, between Kick-Ass and Red Mist, son of the big bad guy.<br /><br />Underneath all this is a movie with humor, heart and an uplifting shootout at the end.</p></br><a href="../users/AOXL514GEE4AA.html">AOXL514GEE4AA</a><br/><p>Dave Lizewski (Johnson) can't help but wonder "Why has no one tried to become a superhero?" As a comic-book nut he decides to take his passion to the next level and become a real-life superhero. His journey begins where else, EBay! What do you expect when you are a high school dork with only a $200 budget? His next step, a name...Kick-Ass or as Big Daddy (Cage) says "more like Ass-Kick"! Of course Kick-Ass has no powers, no skills, no smarts and no cool gadgets but he still inspires NY'ers once his beating by 3 thugs becomes viral on YouTube. His life is now changed by having his own comic book and copy cats. It all seems pretty cool, until he is implicated as the vigilante that is taking down D'Amico's (Strong) drug empire! Now, he is hunted by violent criminals and meets up with a pair of real crazed vigilantes, including an 11-year-old weapons wielding dynamo, Hit Girl (Moretz) and her father, Big Daddy. Kick-Ass eventually learns that the duo have their own score to settle with D'Amico. As obsession turns into madness, Kick-Ass is forced to become a real hero or die!<br /><br />Kudos to everyone involved on this project (both the comic and the film)! Millar's story and Romita's drawings inspired Matt Vaughn's vision and the result is a cult classic that will be loved by comic fanboys and it's own subculture for decades. The true star of this movie is Hit-Girl played amazingly by Chloe Moretz. She absolutely steals the show. Fans of Leon the Professional will immediately pick up the relationship with Moretz and Cage as it is similar to Portman and Reno. The film is dark and although there is comedy, it can be uncomfortable. Ultimately, once the "Ass-Kickin'" starts, you will be cheering with every dead bad guy! A must see.<br /><br />BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: A beautiful picture with outstanding sound. The colors pop and the blacks are rich. Blu-ray has made the home theatre experience so much better. SPECIAL FEATURES: Fantastic, although I would have loved deleted scenes. The two best features are long and include a making of and the origins of the comic book. FINAL THOUGHTS: I loved this movie. Comic book fans will jump all over it. Blu ray collectors should add this as well. Casual fans? Once you see it, you will love it too. A MUST OWN!</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Teenage comic geek Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) asks the question "why hasn't anyone ever tried to be a super hero ?" to his friends. Which leads to him giving it a try and calling himself Kick-Ass. He gets hurt bad the first time, which doesn't stop him from trying it again. After his second attempt is a success and he becomes a hit with the public, a dangerous criminal leader Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) puts a hit on Kick-Ass.<br /><br />  D'Amico thinks that Kick-Ass is the super hero that's getting in the way of his business, when it's in-fact Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and his sidekick daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz). To get his father's approval, Chris D'Aico (Christoper Mintz Plasse) volunteers to disguise himself as a super hero named Red Mist and become friends with Kick-Ass and gain his trust.<br /><br />  Oh no! There's an 8 year old that curses her head off! I should be a big wuss and hate the movie like some of the dumb critics out there. Sue me though, I loved Kick-Ass. Critics who hated the film mostly due to Moretz's potty mouth annoy me. I mean Roger Ebert for one, loved the Exorcist and Orphan and didn't those films have young girls saying horribly disturbing things ? So that's just a poor excuse to hate on the film. It's still incredibly entertaining and easily the best comic based movie since the Dark Knight.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EARN5PUVIF1S.html">A1EARN5PUVIF1S</a><br/><p>This film was certainly a pleasant surprise: a smart, funny superhero movie. What a concept!<br /><br />Really, the sharp script sets the tone here, but the acting and direction carry it along as well.<br /><br />Some of the digital effects look a little cheesy, but the headlong pace hustles the viewer past them in a blink.<br /><br />Otherwise the fight scenes are first rate, and little Hit Girl makes Go Go in "Kill Bill" look like a piker!<br /><br />A great villain, likable hero, and interesting secondary characters all make an impression as well.<br /><br />I have deducted a star only because this DVD has NO extras -- no commentary, making of, casting discussion, nada.<br /><br />This film deserves much better, and with any luck a tenth-anniversary edition will make amends.  I'm sorry I'll have to wait ten years to add this to my collection!</p></br><a href="../users/A1845IJB63D5H7.html">A1845IJB63D5H7</a><br/><p>It hard to make kids write to other kids, or similarly situated folks to their peers. But Kick-Ass conveyed a real daydreaming stage of everyone's past.  An adolescent confronted with boring family situation, hormonal development, and getting to fit in a society geared for attention. A great way to get such attraction is do something about real life problems.  What else is more important to an adolescent than physical strength and security? Superman, why everyone likes Superman but no one ever tried to be one?<br /><br />The daydreaming of an adolescent to fly over physical boundaries and restore order to the tough neighborhood was not the only daydream in town.  Kick-Ass will soon find the real victim of drug crime whose daydream was fueled by a lost wife and a living drug boss for whom he wished total vengeance.  Big-Daddy and Hit-Girl will make Kick-Ass feel great about his wise choice to do good to make people safer.  Red-Mist added another layer of comedy with his sinister plot to drag Kick-Ass out of his ridiculous green suite. Red-Mist played a perfect role of a son of a ruthless drug dealer, wit, quick, but still principled and soft at heart. The dried up texture of Red-Mist and his nasal speech made him a perfect offspring of a notorious drug-pin.<br /><br />Aside from the intelligent design of the movie of playing in one of many daydreams of young people, sustained action, loyalty, betrayal, love, and growing up, the movie also expanded the horizon of physical defense to near perfection of safety to the witty and smart party.  The Hit-Girl was wired with plenty of electronic eyes and remote control to make her a robot acting with absolute immunity from getting injured.  Yet, all the genius and neat planning of Big-Daddy were foiled with trusting a geek bystander.<br /><br />The movie was tense and funny all along. Of course the people that got shot at close distances must live since it is meant to be a daydream with great humor.</p></br><a href="../users/ALLIGF5OZM1I6.html">ALLIGF5OZM1I6</a><br/><p>KICK-ASS<br /><br />STARRING: Aaron Johnson, Chloe Moretz, Nicolas Cage, Mark Stong, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Lyndsy Fonseca, Clark Duke, Evan Peters and Garrett M. Brown<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn; based on the comic book by Mark Miller and John Romita Jr.<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Matthew Vaughn<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Action / Comedy<br />Release Date: 17 April 2010<br />Review Date: 22 April 2010<br /><br />I think it's fair to say that most of us have seen a movie or two that displayed all of its greatest achievements in the trailer. This holds particularly true to films of the comedic genre. Kick-Ass however, had the exact opposite effect. Based on its trailer, I was more than skeptical. I was wondering what Nicolas Cage was doing in a film like this. Man, was I surprised.<br /><br />The first 15 minutes or so had me let down and I was sure the film was gonna be a total drag. But then, out of nowhere, I was completely taken aback by a sharp turn in the tone of the film, and was rolling with laughter from there all the way to its hilarious climax. The fact that the trailer also led me to believe that it was only rated PG - 13, was another genuine treat. It's very much rated R.<br /><br />Aaron Johnson stars as your everyday American high school kid, David. David fantasizes about his teacher, the hot girl in school, and of course what it would be like to have super powers. The latter causes him to ask himself why no-one has ever tried being a superhero without any powers. He shall like to be the first. He orders a costume off the internet and goes to work to fight crime.<br /><br />He looks absolutely ridiculous in his hideous pine green and yellow ninja looking outfit, but that's what makes the film fun. It's called Kick-Ass folks, so if you are taking the time to watch the film, you can't exactly expect it to be Oscar-worthy now can you? Oh yeah, and it's called Kick-Ass, because that's the superhero name he deems himself with.<br /><br />When David finds himself ready to due battle against two local punks, while dressed in his costume of course, we are rooting for him. We expect he will actually take be able to take them down. We expect pretty much anything other than what actually happens, to happen! This would be the 90 degree turn the film takes that I was referring to earlier. We go from a comedy, to a very dark comedy laced with buckets and buckets of blood brought forth from hilarious scenes of violence.<br /><br />There are additional characters in the film, who I found even more appealing than David. Nicolas Cage plays a single father raising his 11-year-old daughter. We meet them in one of the most creative and humorous scenes that I have ever seen and I won't spoil it for you. It's safe to say that only Nicolas Cage could have pulled the scene off as good as he does, and still have us liking the character.<br /><br />Cage and his daughter (Chloe Moretz) play Big Daddy and Hit Girl. They two are masked avengers of justice, and are far better at it than David. Their costumes are so B-rate, that they are in fact genius, and will no doubt be among the most popular come this Halloween.<br /><br />Bid Daddy has trained Hit Girl to be the ultimate crime fighting machine. In addition to that, he's also taught her a long list of choice four-lettered words, to which she delivers with a classic juvenile charm.<br /><br />What so many people have found absurd and offensive about this, is what I appreciated most about the film. The violence that is depicted here isn't exactly what you would call your everyday comic-book movie violence. Hit Girl and Big Daddy brutally murder every bad guy they come across. It may sound strange and twisted, but seeing it in this film, it is hysterical. Cage and Moretz are both sensational actors and are perfect for these roles. They steal the show in every scene and a star has been born in Chloe Moretz.<br /><br />When a ruthless mob boss (Mark Strong) has had enough of the mysterious crime fighters spoiling his plans, he puts forth a counterstrike to trap them, using Kick-Ass. That's pretty much the plot in a nutshell.<br /><br />There are a few things wrong with the film, and even though it's ridiculous, I know they could have written it better. Some jokes were missed and or executed poorly and at times the dialogue wasn't what it could have been either. Nonetheless there are so many genuine laughs, that we are still able to enjoy the film.<br /><br />If you have been told you don't have an open mind, then skip this film. It has been ridiculed by far too many uptight cry-babies and it needs to stop. Don't sabotage a good thing. The film is absurd but it wants to be, and its fans prefer it to be. So leave it alone, or I'll (insert this film title with the word your implanted in the middle of it, and then smile.:)</p></br><a href="../users/A9NCQGVV5W8N0.html">A9NCQGVV5W8N0</a><br/><p>New York, The Present: Dave Lizewski is, by his own admission, a non-descript kind of teenager who drifts from one unremarkable day of high-school to the next. He spends his days fixating on his English teacher's breasts, reading comic books, hanging out at the local comic store with his equally feckless friends and wasting far too much time on social networking sites on the internet. It is this life of unremitting banality - as well as his own inherent naivety - that leads him to don a green and yellow diving suit and mask and attempt to live the life of a superhero. However, as Dave is about to find out, trying to dispense comic book justice and cookie-cutter morality on the streets of a mob-town like New York can be a very dangerous idea indeed...<br /><br />Matthew Vaughn's "Kick Ass" is a glorious satire of the notions of super-heroism, vigilantism, fanboy culture and Gen Y's obsession with spectacle and hyper-reality; I also suspect that is probably a very faithful adaptation of Mark Millar's comic book (and whilst I haven't read this particular book myself, I am familiar enough with the rest of Millar's work to recognise the pertinent hallmarks of lunatic genius that have made the mad Scotsman a "force majeure" in the comic book industry) given that it is violent, foul-mouthed, disturbing and amusing in equal measures (and on a number of different levels) and it is, for the most part, whip-smart. As a screen outing, its also a far more satisfying depiction of Millar's obsessions than the awful "Wanted" movie (a film which took an amoral tale told amorally and attempted to sanitise it for the screen).<br /><br />I can't really go into too many details of the plot without ruining this film but all I will say this: if you're sick of the nauseating pontification that gets shoe-horned into most modern American action cinema, then this will be right up your alley because its a glorious fart in the face of conventional cinematic wisdom and morality. Parents should be warned though that despite being tangentially about superheroes, this film is emphatically NOT suitable for children. Don't let the shiny costumes fool you. It is an adult fairy tale with a pronounced accent on the "adult".<br /><br />For the record, my partner and I generally despise Superheroes and Superhero movies on the grounds that most of them are nauseatingly smug morality plays which have no basis in reality - that was not the case with this film. We both thoroughly enjoyed it and it left us wanting to adopt a "Hit-Girl" of our very own.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Kick-Ass" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Dave Lizewski, a comic-book fanboy, decides to take his obsession as inspiration to become a real-life superhero. As any good superhero would, he chooses a new name -- Kick-Ass -- assembles a suit and mask to wear, and gets to work fighting crime. There's only one problem standing in his way: Kick-Ass has absolutely no superpowers. His life is forever changed as he inspires a subculture of copy cats, is hunted by assorted violent and unpleasant characters, and meets up with a pair of crazed vigilantes, including an 11-year-old sword-wielding dynamo, Hit Girl and her father, Big Daddy.<br /><br />The cast led by Aaron Johnson (as Dave Lizewski / Kick-Ass), Christopher Mintz-Plasse (as Chris D'Amico / Red Mist), Mark Strong (as Frank D'Amico), and in standout performances, Chloe Moretz (as Mindy Macready / Hit Girl) & Nicolas Cage (as Damon Macready / Big Daddy) is great!

This is a fun and witty ride. Nicolas Cage & Chloe Moretz both stand out in this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>What a wacky movie this is. When I first saw the previews, I thought this Kick-Ass was going to be aimed at kids and teens. Boy was I way off, because it earns it's R rating many times over. I really had no intention of seeing this film until I saw the very positive reviews flowing in from the critics. Not that I always agree with them, but in this case I would like to thank them for getting my butt down to the local theater today.<br /><br />Parts of the movie reminded me of Watchmen. You have everyday people who are sick of bad things happening to good people, decide to put on costumes, have funny hero names, and then beat and cut apart the bad guys in a not so nice way. I actually thought it was rather tame in the gore department, compared to what I read about beforehand, but the violence and language is way too strong for kids.<br /><br />The acting is good from everyone. I liked newcomer Aaron Johnson as Kick-Ass himself. Nicolas Cage turns in one of his better performaces in a long time, though I think he was great in an over-the-top kind of way in The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is still doing his McLovin thing in every movie since Superbad, but it worked again. Mark Strong is kind of one note as the villain, like in Sherlock Holmes, but I think he's a little better in this role. The real star of the show is little 11-year-old, Chloe Moretz, as Hit-Girl. She is clearly the most memorable thing in a movie with a bunch of stuff worth remembering. As the daughter of Cage's Big Daddy hero, she spews out bad language, slices and shoots baddies by the dozens, and loves her daddy. I want one of my own.<br /><br />Kick-Ass is serious in tone most of the time, but there are some killer comedy bits and lines that had the whole theater erupting with laughter. The music is well placed in key scenes and the director/writer, Matthew Vaughn, did a fine job in creating a comic book film that should please both fans and non-fans of the genre alike.<br /><br />Even though it looks like Kick-Ass will come in #1 this weekend, it still feels more like a cult film to me. I can easily see this movie being talked about decades from now, much like Army of Darkness, but without the campiness factor. What a breath of fresh air in a genre that has just as many misses as it does hits.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I have wanted to see Kick-Ass ever since I saw the trailer over a year ago. What looked to be just another "by the numbers" sophomoric comedy turns out to be a brilliant and wickedly funny satire for adults.<br /><br />This film isn't going to appeal to everyone and I'm not here to insult anyone on either side of the fence. I enjoyed the film and I see nothing wrong with it. If you don't like it that's fine too and if you don't think your kids should see it, then don't let them, it wasn't intended for kids, but I do believe that trailer marketed it to look like a much more innocent film. The R rating should be enough warning for parents to get the idea that this film isn't for children.<br /><br />As far as the violence involving this young actress, I can remember many Little Rascal shorts that involved the rascals dragging adults across boards with nails in them or hitting them in the head with hammers etc, so this is not all that new to the world. I realize that this film shows violence that is way more graphic, but I also think we have become a little over sensitive and read way too much into everything these days.<br /><br />There were similar reactions to 'The Exorcist' and 'Pretty Baby' in their day and since Linda Blair and Brooke Shields seemed to have turned out OK I see no reason for such commotion. Everything is open to individual interpretation and depending on your age you may not realize that this has been going on since the early stages of filmmaking. I remember eight Shirley Temple vehicles called 'Baby Burlesks' she made before her wonderful feature films that portrayed 3 year olds as adults which I find much more alarming that this film.<br /><br />Now.....let's get to the movie. The casting is perfect with each of the four heroes having their own quirks and enough back story to propel this kind of film. Aaron Johnson plays the title character a Peter Parker type of nerdy school kid who without the aid of super powers decides he wants to fight crime. Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays "Red Mist" another school nerd who's father happens to be a gangster boss. Nick Cage gives one of his best performances as "Big Daddy" an ex cop who was framed and jailed for 5 years and wants nothing more than to crush those responsible. He enlists the aid of his pint sized potty mouthed daughter Mindy A.K.A. "Hit Girl" played by Chloe Moretz who absolutely owns this film! Moretz shows incredible chops here not only as an actress, but as a stunt person, she performs almost all her own stunts and her performance is amazing. I know some see this kid's character as child exploitation, but really each child is different and some are more mature that others and it is her parents responsibility not mine to see to it she can handle such a role.<br /><br />While the film is extremely violent, it is portrayed much like in many comic books today which is a lot more disturbing than this film. I know that a lot of adults read comics, but comics are made for kids or at least that was their original intent, if comic books are going to have graphic violence, maybe there should be age restrictions on those too? I haven't seen an actual 'Kick Ass' comic book so I can't respond on how closely this movie portrays the comic, but I can tell you, this is easily one of the best comic book movies ever made.<br /><br />The Blu Ray combo pack has a slick looking transfer and plenty of behind the scenes features for fans. I hope that this Blu Ray DVD combo trend continues as I really like having both Blu Ray and DVD as I haven't fully committed to Blu Ray and it's nice to have both formats in case I want to watch this film as someone's home who doesn't have a Blu Ray.<br /><br />In Short Kick-Ass does just that all around!</p></br><a href="../users/A2UNMXBJSVIXFB.html">A2UNMXBJSVIXFB</a><br/><p>Movie - 4.5<br /><br />Yet another film I never got around to watching in theaters, but still a piece of work that I ended up liking a lot, Kick-Ass really caught me by surprise with the mishmash of elements it possessed in both writing and production. Initially, the trailer for this movie had me thinking it would be more along the lines of a satire, which it kind of is, but it's also a representation of the superhero genre as well as a parody in and of itself (think Edgar Wright and his work with Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz). While not any one aspect of the film overpowers the other, I think there are enough of them to cater to a multitude of audiences. Kick-Ass is the story of Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), an average teenager with average problems who likes to read comics, becomes a self-made, wannabe superhero, and within this life, comes to realize its hazards, while also trying to impress a girl at school (Lyndsy Fonseca). He meets two true superheroes in Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), and adventure ensues as they try to bring down big-time mobster Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong). For me personally, I found the main theme to be a coming-of-age story. Dave has a good heart and wants to do good things (and get laid), but ultimately isn't much of a superhero, later realizing he wasn't really cut out for the gig. His character is sympathetic and very relatable, in my opinion, and does a great job propelling the audience into all kinds of other aspects. In addition to Dave's self-discovery, the film also has various instances of dark and raunchy comedy, character drama, vengeance and redemption, and brutal, stylized violence, of which the last is probably the most controversial in the form of 11 year-old Moretz's depiction for her character. However, if anything else, this particular aspect of the film will probably wow most people over because it really is a great performance with enough of a message (if you want to interpret one), while also being escapist entertainment at its best. I just wish the movie were a little longer to flesh out the characters a bit more, but we'll see if they expand upon that in the sequel.<br /><br />Video - 4.0<br /><br />I swear I thought something was wrong with the transfer upon my initial viewing. Colors seem vibrant enough, but become way overblown at times, while black levels were inconsistent, crushed, and on occasion shades of blue. Contrast was affected as well by those fluctuating blacks and resulted in lost detail and smeared textures. But after watching the extras, I found out it was all intentional. You see, in the comics the ink artist was told that he wasn't to use the color black.. ever. Looking at some of the pictures from the comic, it certainly makes for a much more peculiar type of art style, but what looks good on paper doesn't always necessarily translate well to the film medium. While the grain thing may have worked for Zack Snyder and 300, colors, blacks, contrast, and sharpness still had an amazing amount of depth, detail, and delineation through his cinematography. But here, a lot of the uniqueness seems to work more against the picture than for it. The best examples I can use for comparison are the scenes where Big Daddy raids the lumber factory and the one where Hit Girl is trying to save him and Kick-Ass. In the raid scene, you get a really good look at his costume from a variety of angles. You think it'd be a black, Batman-type suit with a black shotgun in his hands, right? Well, neither of them are black, they're "Off-Black." Who's ever heard of the color "Off-Black?" Black is supposed to be black. But then in the rescue scene when the lights are shot out, the pitch black darkness is as black as the abyss of death (or whatever scary, black allusion you can think of). There were actual blacks within the cinematography here, and they were absolutely perfect. It's just a shame the rest of the film wasn't as clean. Kudos to DP, Ben Davis, and the color department for trying preserve the intended look and integrity of the comic, though.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Sure the video is a bit questionable, but the audio has no issues, whatsoever. The DTS-HD 7.1 track is relatively underused in the presence of dialogue, which sounds perfect and un-muddled, by the way. But when action and ambiance occur, it's quite the technical nugget. Directionality consists of a mixed bag and presents itself mainly through the use of music and whatever sound effects are present on-screen. Things like cars, city noise, and crowd chatter do what's expected of them in terms of proper placement and panning, while the more aggressive sounds like hits, cuts, thuds, and gunshots have a tendency to disperse through any one of the other six surround channels when the moment calls for them. Musical accompaniment and songs from a wide variety of artists and the four composers who worked on this film do a splendid job adding pace and mood, particularly the John Williams Superman homage in Kick-Ass' theme and the Zimmer/Howard Joker theme used build tension at one point. Separation of said effects and music are spot-on, never letting the dialogue get lost. A few great reference scenes would be the aforementioned Big Daddy raid and Hit Girl rescue, or even the final scene where Hit Girl invades D'Amico's headquarters, as there's quite a bit of action and gunshot activity throughout each. LFEs aren't too frequent, but really make themselves known in the form of heavier rounds being fired and through the occasional explosion, burning flame, or bass rhythm. Don't be fooled by the majority of a front-heavy presentation at the beginning. Things will unfold as they should.<br /><br />Extras - 5.0<br /><br />Kick-Ass is loaded with special features. I literally spent 6 hours watching every single feature on the disc: the movie, the movie with P-i-P commentary (skipped the audio one since it's excerpted from the Bonus View Mode), and then the 2-hour making-of featurette (actually a little over 2 hours, if you combine it with the "history of the comic" feature). So this Bonus View thing is apparently Lionsgate's answer to Warner Brothers' Maximum Movie Mode. A window for the commentary takes up the screen with director Matthew Vaughn sitting there in a studio watching the movie (which plays on your screen in the bottom corner), while bits and pieces of behind-the-scenes footage is mixed in with his comments. It's damn informative in a lot of aspects from the pre-production, filming, and post-production phases down to the challenges faced in making the whole thing. Vaughn presents himself well and seems to be really proud of what he accomplished, given a lot of problems that occurred and the fact that they only had a $28 million dollar budget. It's a mix between business-oriented and kick-back commentary on the project and manages to be a very engaging experience. On the other hand, the making-of feature doesn't recycle a thing from the Bonus View Mode and is all fresh material. It essentially covers more of the overall production of the film from beginning to end in great detail and has various interviews, excerpts, and events to really show the viewer how much freakin' work they put into it. Then finally, there's a 20-minute feature talking about the comic, what Mark Millar wanted to do with it, how John Romita Jr. went about drawing it, and all that other stuff. It's truly an exhausting set of extras, but if you ever wanted to know anything about Kick-Ass in either movie or comic form, the Blu-ray is where you need to look.<br /><br />Overall - 4.5<br /><br />This movie was a big surprise for me. Most comic book adaptations to the big screen tend to have fairly linear narratives, an understood formula for storytelling, and plausible protagonists. Kick-Ass is kind of a warped version of these elements, though oddly enough still manages to tell the same kind of story. Its style and overall structure may divide audiences a bit and feel more like a cult favorite compared to the more mainstream franchises, but I personally enjoyed the movie for its quirkiness (a little bit of Vaughn's residual days working on Lock, Stock and Snatch, perhaps?). With a somewhat underwhelming video transfer, perfect audio, and a boatload of extras, Kick-Ass comes highly recommended, especially for fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G0VFQ9198IUF.html">A1G0VFQ9198IUF</a><br/><p>this is not for the young kids at all.  a lot of blood shed.  nice cars, weapons and moves.  i do not know how close to the graphic novel it is but it is a gem.  a must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A3APW42N5MRVWT.html">A3APW42N5MRVWT</a><br/><p>Masterfully realizes (and exceeds) the comics book it is based on.

Admittedly I had barely seen any previews and just new it was about some teenager pretending to be a superhero, but I thought it would be a comedy along the lines of Scary Movie, or Napoleon Dynamite.  I was wrong.<br /><br />Dave Lizewski is your normal average geeky kid.  Until he gets the idea to become a super hero that is.  Then he becomes a little bit more.  But being a super hero isn't all its cracked up to be when the crime starts fighting him back.  And then new super heroes start appearing on the scene, all with different agendas.  Dave feels a little over his head but can't help but get drawn in.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Dave Lizewski/Kick Ass-Aaron Johnson<br />Damon Macready/Big Daddy-Nicholas  Cage<br />Mindy Macready/ Hit Girl-Chloe Moretz<br />Chris D'Amico/Red Mist-Christopher Mintz-Plasse<br />Frank D'Amico-Mark Strong<br />and others...<br /><br />Nicholas Cage has his ups and downs for me, but I actually liked him in this.  I thought he did a great job and liked the voicings and expressions he used for his character.  It added to the comedic value.  Chloe Moretz as his daughter was also very good as well.  She plays quite a controversial character (young girl killing, swearing, etc.) but made it very believable.  That being said, the main character played by Aaron Johnson didn't really do anything for me.  He was important to the film but I thought he could have been better.  As it stands, I didn't really care what happened to him.  The bad guys weren't exactly intimidating either.<br /><br />As said before I had expected this to be more comedy.  While it was to an extent, I would peg it more action/adventure/drama because it did have a lot of serious parts.  Because of all that adventure though, there is a lot of gore and murder in this movie.  Those with faint constitutions may want to think twice before watching.  There is a lot of cussing as well.  For a plot I think this one was actually pretty good.  The movie has a point when it asks why more people don't try to be real superheroes and it does a good job of pointing out why that is.  A downside though is that the pacing is rather poor and this movie, despite being an action film, kind of dragged for me and spent to much time on irrelevant details.<br /><br />Not the best of movies but not the worst either.  I'd probably rate it 3.5 stars in total.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>Matthew Vaughn's KICK-ASS is adapted from a comic book from the same name. Seems like there are tons of movies being made from comics these days, and, except for Spiderman, Superman, etc., I imagine the vast majority of film-goers aren't familiar with the comics these movies are based on.<br /><br />For a movie like this to be successful, it has to appeal to the non-comic book fan. To me, Kick-Ass is an awesome movie, a great superhero origin tale. High school nerd Dave Lizewski  has always dreamed of being a superhero. So, one day he buys a costume, puts it on, and then goes out to fight crime.<br /><br />There are a lot of things to like about the movie. I enjoyed the pulsating soundtrack set to scenes of gory, stylized violence. I loved the cast. Nicholas Cage is at his best. Clarke Duke is the funny sidekick. Mark Strong is the great villain. Lyndsy Fonseca is the beautiful girlfriend. Aaron Johnson even shines as Dave/Kick-Ass. Chlo? Grace Moretz, the young teenager, playing Hit-Girl was the surprise of the film, as well as the center of controversy. Seems some people didn't care to see a young girl get beat up, use foul language, and kill dozens. Come on, lighten up. This is a fun movie, not to be taken seriously.<br /><br />Movies like Kick-Ass are so much better than some of the stuff coming out of Hollywood these days. Because of the extreme violence and bad language, this movie isn't for everyone. But, its funny, clever and a lot of fun. I can't wait for the sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HQXFLZ6WI70Q.html">A3HQXFLZ6WI70Q</a><br/><p>Movie review: This is how all superhero movies should be like; unbridled aggression and violence with a sprinkle of everything else.<br />Bluray review: Video is perfect.

I left the theater so pleasantly surprised, I couldn't fathom why this classic film could be marketed so wrongly. Even the name ROBOCOP suggests something uber-cheesy. I was totally exhilarated by ROBOCOP and the complex, funny, and character driven script that led to the great film I had viewed. I feel exactly the same about KICK-ASS. I had zero desire to see this film in it's theatrical release. All based on advertising. I had expected something as cheesy and kid friendly as SPIDERMAN 1, 2, or 3. What was delivered to me was one of the most chaotic, unapologeticly adult oriented flicks I've ever been privy to view. Not unlike ROBOCOP, KICK-ASS is an intelligent, character driven motion picture geared for the sensibilities, and sense of humor, of the mature viewer that needs a movie like this to remind them that some movies are made to ENTERTAIN. And that's what this flick does. It's damn entertaining. It's much better going into this knowing little about the storyline, so I'm not divulging. Best flick in a while, check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>The beginning of the movie is Quentin Tarantino does Napoleon Dynamite, without the annoying flashbacks, just annoying first person narration. The first person narration eventually goes away. A geek kid decides to become a superhero, and as in real life he doesn't get superhero results. When he is faced with certain death he is saved by an 11 year old girl in a mask(Hit Girl). This is a remarkable scene as the sound track plays the music from the Banana Splits. Yes, the sound track helped make the movie.<br /><br />The initial scene with Nicolas Cage was also a great scene. In order to be a big hit, a movie needs a few great scenes and no bad scenes. I believe this film will be a cult classic. I thought the teen acting was all excellent except for the Red Mist. His bad acting was made up for by a sensational performance by Hit Girl (Dakota Fanning move over) who owned every scene she was in.<br /><br />The nudity mentioned on the box must refer to the quick glimpse we get of "National Geographic porno" we see on the computer while our hero has his pants at his ankles. Frequent f-bomb.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LGRPM88JDWP6.html">A2LGRPM88JDWP6</a><br/><p>I didn't know what to expect from this movie but I liked it a lot. Action, Comedy, Drama, it was all there. Blu-ray looks and sounds great.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>Kick-Ass wasn't what I expected. It is alot more violent than I thought and it involved mobsters. Kick-ass lives up to its name when you're introduced to hit girl played by Chloe Moretz and Nicolas Cage as big daddy. The two are experts with all guns and explosives, and stabbing weapons. Big Daddy, or Damon Macready, trains his little daughter to be a killer with the ultimate goal of putting an end to mob king Frank D'amico played by Mark Strong. This includes some really ridiculous things like testing out bullet-proof vests on his daughter, and putting goals into her head like wanting deadly knifes instead of Barbie dolls. It caught me off guard, and never really was easy to watch.<br /><br />Hit girl does some troubling and sometimes outright wrong things in this movie. It looks like they have her swearing, and saying some adult things, although it could have been made to look this way but that doesn't make it right. The murder scenes are awesome, but deranged as they come from a little girl whose costume even has a plaid skirt. It really is strange how she behaves like a hardened, cool killer with an air of invincibility. It is a twisted tale of father and daughter with the intent on not fighting crime so much, but settling a vendetta.<br /><br />Kiss-ass is about Dave Lizewski, played by Aaron Johnson who looks like a young spider man. One day he orders a cape-less character suit and at first plays out comic book fantasies to himself. In ally's and on roof tops he prepares for the day when he will fight criminals. It becomes tragic, and real when he crosses young thugs and in trying to prevent a crime, kick-ass gets shanked and mauled by traffic. He survives with a new toughness. He can take a beating, and barely feels a thing. There is a realness and violence that makes these scenes serious, even though they are made light of later with jokes and funny situations.<br /><br />Instead of learning a lesson and growing up a bit, Dave sticks to his guns and once again helps out. He fights like rocky, taking serious blows that would knock the spirit out of anyone else, but he keeps fighting. It gets taped and put on YouTube by people who would rather watch than help, and Dave becomes an internet sensation. He loves the popularity gained, but this movie paints a serious world and soon Dave finds more trouble than he can handle.<br /><br />Kick-ass has some awesome music, which is a collaboration of many musicians. John Murphy is my personal favorite and the use a remix version of a song from 28 days later. There is more gun battles than straight out fist to face. There is a more serious danger to Kick-ass, that you wouldn't expect from a movie with teens and a girl that is around 11. It delivers in action and originality. It is shocking, and vulgar, and very unpredictable. I enjoyed this movie but thought some moments in this movie pushing the envelope. I do recommend this movie though, but it was not easy to do even though appropriately rated (R).</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>The concept of an average, every day comic book geek donning spandex attire and becoming a super-hero is one that I find quite interesting. I'm sure there are a few crazy people in the world who have contemplated or even attempted just that, but in the comic world, the only character I've been familiar with becoming a super-hero with no particular superpower is Batman. When this was first released and up to the point of me seeing it, I wasn't familiar that this was also made into a comic book, but I was intrigued by the concept and motive behind why the kid in this film wanted to take the leap of faith in becoming a superhero. I gave it a go, and I must say I loved it. Don't expect a full blown comedy, as it's more of a serious action flick, but an enjoyable one nonetheless.<br /><br />Starring Aaron Johnson in the title role of Dave Lizewski, the film tells of how Dave has always wondered why nobody has tried being a superhero (except that one guy at the start of the film who ends up dead). Dave decides to stop wondering and buys himself a green and yellow spandex suit and calls himself Kick-Ass. Life as a super-hero doesn't start very well as he's almost killed in his first attempt at heroics, but he's soon back in action and becomes a viral hit as he's filmed saving a lonely stranger from being beaten up. This gets him some unwanted attention from Mob boss, Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) and his son Chris/Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Passe) as he's mistaken as being the man behind a number of mob deaths which were actually committed by the mysterious Father/Daughter team of Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) and Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage [sigh]).<br /><br />The films tone is something that is a lot more serious and brutal than you can possibly guess when first going into it as it starts off quite goofy and funny, but when he puts on his hero suit, the film takes a more serious turn. There are some bad points to the film, but thankfully they are outweighed by a plethora of good points; most importantly the character of Hit-Girl. There are two ways you can look at this character; you can be very disturbed by the fact that an 11 year old girl can call someone a f***er then proceed with blowing an enemies head off, or you can watch that exact scene and think "that is "f***ing awesome!" I chose to go with the latter as she was truly magnificent. Nick Cage, on the other hand, was far from magnificent.<br /><br />I know Cage has a devoted following of fans, but I think he's just awful. I can't take the man seriously in any role he plays, and in my eyes every moment he was on screen was just the pits (unless he was supported by other cast members). I could have easily given this film a 5 star rating had Cage's character been played by someone a lot more fitting for the role. I would've preferred someone along the lines of Michael Keaton or Kevin Costner, an old school actor that you can still appreciate today and not want to place your palm on your forehead in disappointment the moment they appear on screen.<br /><br />The look of the film and style of the film overall is brilliantly done. The fact that the film was released shortly before the comic and it was a project that came together collaboratively with Mark Miller working on the comic and Matthew Vaughn working on the movie, when I check the comic out, there will definitely be cool similarities. I would highly recommend this, not for Nick Cage, but for everything else.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JTD6D79HNA5X.html">A2JTD6D79HNA5X</a><br/><p>I think almost everyone's fav. hero in this film was hit-girl. Who can blame them? She's cool, funny, and dangerous. Kick-Ass is a great action film about people wanting to be superheros and the few who actually do. The action is wilded and the main nerdy guy who pretends to be gay so he can hang with the girl he wants who always wanted a gay friend was funny. Nicolas Cage is good as the "batman" hero and the dude from Superbad who played the evil guy was good too. It has a great opening and the film doesn't let up at all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>When I saw the trailers when this movie was at the theaters I thought this might be an entertaining young adult movie and so I added it to my to rent list. Had I known how entertaining I would have made a now rare visit to my local theater to enjoy this with an audience when it first released. Most kids and even some adults still have the dream of making a difference whether doning a costume or just helping their community in some way. The story here is compelling and like the music starts at a slow tempo as we are introduced first to "Kick-Ass", well portrayed by Aaron Johnson. He is a high school student that finally gets tired of bullies and decides to take steps to not only improve his own self-esteem but assist others that are afraid to take a stand. On his first mission to save a lost cat he drops literally into three men beating up another. His fight to defend the single man from the gang is painful for him and lands him it the hospital with broken bones but it is posted on all the usual hot amateur video sites and he becomes famous overnight.<br /><br />This stardom catches the attention of "Hit Girl", remarkably done by Chloe Moretz (some superbly choreagraphed scenes make her larger than life), and "Big Daddy", well played by Nicolas Cage (purposely overacted while in hero mode is good acting not bad), that have been more reclusive and deadlier against criminals. When they save Kick-Ass from certain death a bond is formed against crime. The choreography and stunts of the fight scenes are phenomenal and the music is fantastic (the CD will be a huge hit I'm sure). As the story unfolds we find out that Big Daddy not only was falsely accused of drug trafficing while he was a police officer but he ends up in jail and his wife commits suicide. Fortunately their daughter is born with her death. When Big Daddy gets out of prison he vows to avenge his wife, and he enlists the aid of his very young daughter on his quest. Enter the villains son, Red Mist, that convinces his father to get him some gear to impress Kick-Ass so that he can lure him into a trap. The events that transpire after this build to an incredible climax that is suspenseful and exhilarating.<br /><br />I won't spoil things for you with any more of the details but there are some absolutely hysterical/bloody scenes that will quite possibly have you laughing and crying with joy. Anyone that feels overly offended by vigilantes may be disturbed. Although I'm not saying I condone it, how can I possibly condone what criminals do to the innocent public? Keep in mind everyone has been exposed to far worse on the news every day. I highly recommend this to anyone that can appreciate unconventional heroes and can stomach some bloody killing scenes. The DVD has excellent quality picture and sound with a few extras. Superb story, casting, directing, choreography, stunts, camera work, costumes, music, and special effects.

Just thinking about the movie the day after provokes a chuckle so there's a little something special embedded in this movie - kudos to the KA film posse.<br /><br />Let's cut it short - five big ones for this little creative and surprising gem.<br /><br />Caveats to the viewers and to Chloe Grace (Mindy). First to the viewing audience as you already know from other sources there's a bit of profanity and blood - don't worry it's so outrageous it's more funny than psychologically harmful. Second to Chloe Grace,  take everything you said and did as outrageous satire and be sure to hold up as some of your role models truly great athletes who are always in control of themselves. Despite the battles they encounter they don't need the profanities, the fights - they handle it all with artistic intelligence and skill.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Dave Lizewaski (Aaron Johnson) is your average big city teenager and comic book geek, he feels like an outcast to some of the other students. When crime has been happening thanks to gangster Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), he orders a wet suit and decides to become a superhero named Kick-Ass. Although he has no superhero, he has metal plates in some parts of his skeleton and excellent fighting abilities with two clubs in his arms fighting whatever criminal and thug is out there. However, two of the city's well known superheroes such as Big-Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and assassin Hit-Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) begin to make a comeback since Kick-Ass has became a pop culture phenomenon as they start to kill some crooks by themselves as well as have Kick-Ass join them. The don's son Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) becomes an anti-hero himself called Red Mist to lure the heroes into a deadly trap that can cost them their lives.<br /><br />Ultraviolent, hilarious and wild action-comedy based on the cult Marvel comic from Mark Millar! this one is basically like a satire on superheroes even on the very idea that what if superheroes existed in real life. The film has been controversial due to an 11 year old girl character killing people and cussing even though the actress is really in her young teens, i think this movie is a gory and relentless action packed bath of jokes and blood with ideas of course, this movie is a winner all the way.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray includes flawless picture perfect image quality and theatrical sound to it with great extras like Ass-Kicking Bonus-View, commentary, featurettes, art gallery and marketing.

Aaron Johnson stars as Dave, a teenage loser whose obsession with comic books leads him to donning a ridiculous costume, calling himself Kick-Ass, and fighting crime.  Things don't go so well for him naturally in the process as he winds up getting his you know what handed to him, and eventually comes across masked vigilantes Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) who are targeting gangster Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) whose own son (Superbad's Christopher Mintz-Plasse) decides to don a costume and call himself Red Mist.  Directed by Layer Cake helmer Matthew Vaughn (who at one time was set to helm the third X-Men film, and is no preparing an X-Men prequel), Kick-Ass is filled with fun, ridiculous violence and action, but sadly manages to lose steam after its first half.  The cast is great (Cage in particular has great fun doing an Adam West impersonation) all around, but even they can't save the fact that by the time Kick-Ass wraps up, it's become the kind of comic film that it pokes fun at in the first place.  Not to mention the fact that so much of the little things that made the comic and its characters so interesting (namely the real "secret" origin of Big Daddy and Hit Girl in the comic) is nowhere to be found, as are most of the darkly comedic moments and are replaced by more or less happier turnouts.  Despite how much the film adaptation of Kick-Ass has been streamlined from the comic though, the film is still plenty fun and enjoyable, and the fact that it didn't undergo a complete overhaul like the film adaptation of Wanted is reason enough to praise it alone.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Such is KICK-ASS: over-the-top, hilarious, brutally violent.  It chronicles the rise (if we want to call it that) of the titular hero, whose secret identity is almost a nonentity: Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), a nobody at his high school, pining after a girl who thinks he's gay.  When Dave dons his superhero costume (a green and yellow wetsuit) and starts kicking butt, he becomes an Internet sensation.  But other people take notice: Big Daddy (Nic Cage) and his daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz).  Most noticeably, there's crime kingpin Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), whose son (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) just wants in on the family business, even if it means making a friend and subsequently betraying him.  All of these culminates in a bloody, brilliant show-down.<br /><br />At the heart of KICK-ASS (and there is a heart) is the notion that only social misfits and people unsatisfied with their lot in life would ever don a costume.  No one in this film is perfect; Dave is lost and looking for himself, and both Big Daddy and Hit Girl are sociopaths; they make D'Amico (who microwaves a guy alive) look tame.  But that's the genius of KICK-ASS: it never takes itself seriously, so you never get the idea that it's promoting (or condemning, for that matter) violence.  The film (and graphic novel) just IS: it's here for your entertainment, and make of it what you will.<br /><br />Matthew Vaughn's directing is solid, as is the script; but the film hinges entirely upon the performances, as most films of this kind do.  Graphic violence and dark humor will only get you so far--as evidenced by the fact that the film falls away in the middle, as the violence slowly overtakes the humor.  Thankfully, we have solid performances, mainly from the supporting cast; Johnson is fine, but he couldn't have carried this film alone.  We have Mark Strong as the villain, menacing and hilarious at the same time; Strong has a knack for sinking his teeth into this sort of role.  As D'Amico's son, Mintz-Plasse manages to break out of typecast; he's entirely believable in his role as (first) and ignored son, and then as the masked "hero" Red Mist.  But it's really the teaming of Cage and Moretz that will be remembered.  Cage is delightfully over-the-top, going from aw-shucks to Dark Knight and back again.  Moretz is a wonder; easily the most controversial part of the film (and that's saying a lot, considering the level of violence here), she spouts obscenities and slits throats with a grace that's rarely seen in these films (also in time with the requisite rock 'n roll soundtrack; Vaughn getting his Tarantino on).  It's Hit Girl this film will be most remembered for, but really, the whole cast deserves a round of applause.  Even with the stellar source material, even with a fine script and directing and choreography, this film could easily have tanked.  As is, it stands as a great entry into the superhero cannon, both parodying the genre and trying to explain some of its appeal.  It is dark, laugh-out-loud hilarious, and violent: everything you could want on a Friday night.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I saw this a few hours ago with some friends, and we all thought it was hilarious and incredibly bloody. I wasn't expecting too much, but I was pleasantly surprised. A dorky teen named Dave Lizewski begins wondering why people haven't decided to be real-life superheroes. When he buys a costume on the internet, he goes around and tries to help people and says that his name is 'Kick-Ass' He inspires Big Daddy and Hit-Girl to stop a drug dealer named Frank D'Amico. They soon decide to work with Kick-Ass because they are all on the same team. Will Kick-Ass, Big Daddy, and Hit-Girl be able to take down the powerful drug lord? I highly recommend KICK-ASS!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8.html">A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8</a><br/><p>Simply put: I waited for so long to watch the kick-ass. I don't know why it is such a  good and funny movie. And Hit-Girl is totally adorable. Loved her part very much. Red Mist played a good role...a sweet costume and outlook but totally a bastard. Kick-Ass himself was okay. Not my favorite out of them 4 but it's a movie about him and it's damn fine. I am not sure whether there will be made part 2, books confuse me. But I'll be waiting for it. Of course only if the hit-girl will have her part in it. Coz she is so cool. This is in no way just for kids or a teenagers. The movie is rated R for a reason.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QH6BEY6RYQR0.html">A3QH6BEY6RYQR0</a><br/><p>A high school kid who is a bit of a misfit tries on a superhero outfit, and before long, he becomes a folk hero. Kick-A**, as he calls himself, encounters a father and daughter who are also in the superhero business. Kick-A** unwittingly becomes involved in the killings of some local drug dealers and the mafia boss goes after him. The movie contains stylized scenes of graphic violence punctuated by dark humor, which make it exciting, funny, and unique. This was a terrific pre-summer treat that will be fun for those who see it.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>Have you ever wanted to be a superhero. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG9846">Kick-Ass</a> is about four very different people who take very different paths to become superheroes. With a few exceptions, they do provide some innovative fighting scenes and hilarious moments.<br /><br />First, the great. One of the superheroes, Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), is a adorable 10-year old girl who has a passion for guns and slaughtering bad guys the way other young girls get excited for jewelry or dolls. Chloe is a great actress and gives her character a unique spunk and energy. In several scenes, she has the best fighting scenes and is absolutely merciless. She easily steals the show.<br /><br />The fighting scenes are also pretty cool. Make no mistake - this is a violent movie. But unlike a lot of other fighting movies, it doesn't take itself too seriously. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG9846">Kick-Ass</a> is willing to be original in terms of who gets killed and how. I don't want to spoil anything, but let's just say that somebody knows how to use a knife very well. At times, you won't know whether to be disgusted by the violence or laughing at the absurdity.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG9846">Kick-Ass</a> also sets up the contrasts between the mundane and superhero worlds really well. The high school world of teen romance and comic books looks petty in comparison with the blood and gore of the fight scenes. Also, the corny superhero names and goofy costumes contrasted with the deadly seriousness of the characters - what a riot. And, of course Chloe Moretz as a cute little girl who swears like a truck driver and kills like a commando is the ultimate mind-boggling contrast in this movie.<br /><br />I did feel the movie went a bit far in some scenes. Some scenes were just filled with gratuitously bloodshed and outright murder. I still don't get why Hollywood has abandoned the art of panning away right before the victim gets killed (interestingly enough, the only time <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG9846">Kick-Ass</a> does spare you the sight of blood is when a female gets killed). I think the movie would actually have benefitted from a bit less explicit gore and more innuendo.<br /><br />I also thought the rest of the casting was alright, but not stellar. I've never been a fan of Nicholas Cage, and this movie convinced me that his acting just isn't up to it. The contrast between him and Chloe Moretz - his daughter in the movie - is striking. Aaron Johnson is decent as the dorky Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass, but gets overshadowed halfway through the film - his character reaches his peak too quickly. Mark Strong as the druglord villain just doesn't convince. We're supposed to fear and hate his character, but really he just comes across as a good excuse to kick some ass.<br /><br />Overall, I'd warn sensitive types away from this movie. This is a comedy only in the darkest sense. However, if you like a few laughs, a bit of fighting, and a lot of both mixed together, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG9846">Kick-Ass</a> works wonders. It's original, fresh, and funny. But for some of the casting and excess in gore, I feel it could even have become an action-hero classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>A high school nobody and comic book aficionado (Aaron Johnson) decides to become a real life superhero (despite the lack of superpowers), christens himself Kick-Ass, and promptly gets his ass kicked by a couple of street goons.  This tips us off that we are not in store for the typical superhero movie.  Displaying incredible courage-slash-unbelievable stupidity, he persists in his mission and is drawn into a war between a drug kingpin (Mark Strong) and a couple of Batman and Robin knockoffs, Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and his daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), who is the real thing.<br /><br />Some may be put off by the violence and profanity, particularly since many of the characters are so young, so be warned: this film deserves its R rating.  If that doesn't bother you, you're in store for a very funny comedy with plenty of exuberant action scenes. Moretz steals the show and Cage is hilarious channeling Adam West while in his Big Daddy persona.  Johnson is low-key but likeable, which is just what his character requires.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>The movie lives up to it's name. Kick-Ass is a hilarious tongue-in-cheek parody of super heros and comics. It starts out with the main character (Kick-Ass) narrating. The audience sees a costumed hero leap from a tall building and...splat...lands on a taxi. The kid is a geek whose only super power seems to be that he is virtually invisible to the opposite sex. He gets it in his head that he should try to be a super hero. His disguise? A green wet suit. His first outing is not very successful, having been stabbed and then hit by a car. On the plus side he has metal reinfocements throughout his skeleton and deadened nerve ending. Meanwhile Big Daddy and Hit-Girl are disrupting a drug lord's operations (and humorous Batman jokes are plentiful). When the three meet, Hit-Girl shows that she more than lives up to her name, having been well tarined by her "Big Daddy." The movie has a simple, yet effective plot, delivers the action, the gun fights, the topical super hero references, a foul mouthed little girl, a dad who is out for revenge, and a comic nerd who eventually gets the girl of his dreams by the end of the film. It is highly recommended for an afternoon of pure escape and fun. It is a movie you can watch again and again, rooting for the heros, and watching the bad guys get what is coming to them. This is a must see! For fans of Kill Bill, Spider-Man,and Sin City.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Don't look now, but Kick-Ass is the beginning of a new trend in superhero movies.  Here's why it matters:<br /><br />Two words: Hit-Girl.  Or maybe that's one word. Whatever.  Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) isn't just an equalizer, she's a cross between Stephanie from LazyTown and Robin from Batman.  Hit-Girl is a descendant of the same violent breed of superhero that has been beating villains up for decades, except that she's an 11-year-old girl.  More importantly, she's a female superhero that isn't overtly sexual.  She's the next step up from the Powerpuff Girls. I realized that true Girl Power had come to superhero movies when Hit-Girl punched a grown man in the face with brass knuckles.<br /><br />Being a superhero has consequences.  We are reminded that Hit-Girl is basically a sociopath who has never been to school.  Hit-Girl views life as a video game, a point reinforced in first-person perspective through her nightvision goggles as she shoots and stabs her way through piles of thugs. Her father Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) is a cold-blooded killer who will slit his opponents' throats. Kick-Ass (Aaron Johnson) is so terrified of the mass slaughter the aforementioned "heroes" inflict that he vows to quit the superhero gig entirely.  It doesn't stick of course.<br /><br />It was a graphic novel FIRST. Graphic novels often trail movies, adding more detail that was left out.  Kick-Ass the comic was released before the movie, giving the entire plot away.  It doesn't seem to have harmed the film at all. Graphic novels may now become an official extension of movies as part of their development - storyboards and comic panels have a lot in common after all.<br /><br />Kick-Ass plays for keeps. Kick-Ass isn't so much realistic as it is gritty.  It dispenses with superhero tropes like superpowers and embraces the difficulties of secret identities, not having any powers, and getting hurt.  Kick-Ass gets so beaten up by an uncaring world that he lands in a hospital.  People die.  A lot.<br /><br />Part thoughtful meditation on the perils of our violence-drenched celebrity culture, part non-stop rollercoaster ride of every adolescent's superhero dreams, Kick-Ass is like one long movie trailer - all action without the boring parts. Kick-Ass is awesome, not because of just what it does but because of what it represents.  I patiently await a more PG-oriented version of Hit-Girl that will inspire little girls everywhere to play with superhero action figures.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>Never in my born days did I suspect London, England, could double for New York City - with Elstree and Pinewood studios offering the rest of the necessary sets. Here it works, and that is one of the many things I love about KICK-ASS (a/k/a KICKASS). Though I'm fairly certain I spotted some familiar London street scenes.<br /><br />The sweet-looking newcomer Aaron Johnson [(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7VHPU">The Illusionist (Full Screen Edition)</a> as the young "Eisenheim"] plays David Lizewski, a typical high school kid who longs to be a superhero after it dawns on him that we need superheroes. He orders a unique wetsuit online, and in no time becomes KICK-ASS, New York's answer to Batman. He knows very well, as he admits in his ongoing narrative, that the going won't be so easy. His first time out proves that, but I will not spoil it here. Suffice it to say it is so funny I almost fell to the floor. No kidding.<br /><br />Cutting across the story of KICK-ASS is the story of Batman lookalike "Big Daddy" (Nicholas Cage) and his well-trained 11-year old daughter "Hit-Girl" (a delightfully brash and foulmouthed Chlo? Grace Moretz) - these are the true superheroes with money, equipment and attitudes from hell to back their plays. Kick-Ass becomes famous through the miracle of the internet, and I loved the brief but powerful parody of internet fame. Kick-Ass receives pleas for help thereby, he meets Big Daddy and Hit-Girl. It is then he learns exactly what he has chosen for his vocation, a bit too late, one might say.<br /><br />This film is not for the faint of heart, yet is so hilarious, with its common touch, that it is riveting. I'm not really sure what I thought of a lethally trained pre-adolescent girl equally proficient with firearms and knives. All I can say is I'd be damned proud if I had a daughter like her. (My wife is like her, though.) Nicholas Cage seems gaunt and grouchy, but his character is worth 1,000 words. It is the one critique I have: Cage and Johnson should each have had their own separate films.<br /><br />Perhaps that is in the works, but I doubt Cage or anyone like him will return. You will see for yourself why that is. In the end, everyone learns what the price of "super" power really is. As Kick-Ass says, with no power there is no responsibility, but ... we all know the end of that sentence.<br /><br />Running straight into the evil mob boss Frank D'Amico (the incredible Mark Strong doing an excellent NYC accent), the superheroes all end up paying a heavy price indeed. Again, I will not spoil this either.<br /><br />A few observations:<br /><br />1. Aaron Johnson is one of the most handsome stars I've ever seen this side of Ryan Phillippe. As this film strives to demonstrate in very funny ways, he's allegedly not gay ... he certainly seems to be to me. Johnson's engagement to a forty-something-year-old broad (director of Johnson's other "big" film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036TGT5M">Nowhere Boy</a>) when he was 19 is basically THE 'gay red flag' of the decade. So bear in mind as you see this film, Johnson was already engaged to a woman old enough to be his mother - and then some.<br /><br />2. This film could have done well without as much cheesy music (come on, Elvis?!), but it is for the most part a powerful soundtrack. Some song that I think is called "Town Ain't Big Enough for the Both of Us" is awesome.<br /><br />3. Director Matthew Vaughn (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010Z32OA">Stardust</a>) has a real feel for heroes: he outdoes the wretched WATCHMEN though I admit there'd be none of this without that original comic.<br /><br />Why are the British doing all this cool stuff? It took me 1/2 hour to realize everyone in the film is British except for Nicholas Cage and perhaps two others. It took me until the final credits to realize it was all filmed in London. No wonder some of the characters gave me the creeps - you know, the willies you get from an "American" who just doesn't sound right.<br /><br />Keep <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007A2GSW">The Incredibles (Full Screen Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a> near to hand if you are fainthearted, I'm warning you fair and square. KICK-ASS does not skimp on the reality of the violence, but it is not gratuitous or disgusting like, say, SIN CITY (which is cited in this film). The skilled way it switches between violence and comedy is refreshing. I think it drives home the fact that violence is NOT funny or light-hearted.<br /><br />Get this and stew in the first viewing a while before seeing it again: it will inform you deeply about your hidden feelings regarding vigilantism, violence, pop culture and comic books. They are all related, and I've never seen a film explain that intimate connexion like this does.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>I saw this at a theater a week or two ago, at the tail end of its theatrical run. Didn't know quite what to expect, but enjoyed it for what it was: a violent, goofy, over-the-top exercise in comic-book mayhem.  I guess with a name like "Kick-Ass" you'd have to expect violence, and this movie has it. Lots of it. But it also offers some sly social commentary and moments of dark humor. "Kick-Ass" is not for everyone, but if you don't mind swearing (lots!) and violence, then you'll probably get a kick out of "Kick-Ass."  Overall, I give this a low 4 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>As you watch it, you begin to give it points for being better than expected. The trailer leads you to certain conclusions, the movie goes somewhere a little more rewarding. A fun time. Not for the kids, but so what.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Kick... is an entertaining movie I have some issues though with a Little Girl cursing like a sailor(hopefully not the stereotypical one that we know now)and being ultra-violent, I have no qualms with violence and violent movies but not when a Kid is the one,besides that and a horrible performance by Nicholas Cage I enjoyed most of it,except the beginning of course and that it was basically a bunch of dweebs.I have not read nor will Read the material it's based on,I think the re-do the whole superhero thing and make it like this ruins the Superhero Genre,yes the Superhero movie has been done to death sadly,and Hollywood is to blame but this is not the answer,it is different and that can mean good or bad I watched it and was not impressed.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>Ok, I liked this film, I don't know why people said it was really funny. It had some slapstick humor but the characters of the super hero were all very good except red-mist who really wasn't a super hero but just a phony wanna be. Towards the end, the film makes you want it to end. Great first half, Nicholas Cage kind of redeemed himself but he really is a bigger actor than all these films he's done recently. What happened to the man who made Leaving Las Vegas? I understand there's an age for everything but I'm happy he's bouncing back and this is definitely a step in the positive direction for him. My favourite thing about the film was the little girl with the cool purple hair, her attitude was amazing. She reminded me of the little sister to the main character in 500 days of summer. The stand-out feature is that the film is not one percent cheesy surprisingly. It is not very very funny unless you found Superbad the funniest film of all time. Slightly geeky and indie but overall a little over-rated. Definitely worth watching, exceeded my expectations but still, I'm not watching the correct films this year.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>"Kick-Ass" was entertaining and fun.  However, I wanted something a little different than what I got.  I wanted something over the top and fast paced.  Instead, "Kick-Ass," while certainly over the top, is not fast paced at all.  Rather, it is two completely different movies shoehorned into one, that are only tied together at the very end.  The first movie is the story of a schlubby teen who becomes Kick-Ass out of a love of comic books and sense of idealism.  The second movie is the story of Big Daddy and his daughter Hit Girl, who are far more successful superheroes.  Oddly, the story of Kick-Ass is less serious than the story of Big Daddy and Hit Girl.  "Kick-Ass" suffers from jarring tonal shifts as well as a very slow moving first act.  If you can wade through the first 20-30 minutes, the better stuff kicks in.<br /><br />However, at 2 hours this movie was too long for its own good.  The length is attributable to the fact that there are two different jammed-together stories to tell.  Paradoxically, even with the 2-hour length, the narrative seems thin and not fully fleshed out.<br /><br />Hit Girl is awesome, and is without a doubt the best part of this movie.  I would have preferred that the movie be called "Hit Girl" and that it was 90 minutes with her.  That's one sequel I can enthusiastically await!<br /><br />"Kick Ass" is at least worth a rent, but I doubt you will want to own this unless you are a comic book movie completist.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K3NQAO49LXL2.html">A1K3NQAO49LXL2</a><br/><p>A silly and ultra-violent film that is totally pointless and insane. And kinda-sorta good fun to watch. Best thing about it is seeing McLovin again, except this time as a stuffed-nose anarchist. Nicholas Cage was pretty good, even if he was acting like a robot. The appearance of bottled rage, perhaps? The mafia boss was not really that dangerous-looking, at least not until he shot that kid in cold blood in the middle of the street. Yuck.</p></br><a href="../users/A153NZD2WZN5S3.html">A153NZD2WZN5S3</a><br/><p>A half parody on heroic movies batman et al, a half tragic comedy of public tired so much of individual liberties somehow transformed into individual insecurity of modern urbanits looking wherever for whoever to protect them by falling from the skies.<br /><br />Not too good, not too bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>At the start of "Kick-Ass," I couldn't help but feel somewhat excited, as I was introduced to the title character, who, when not dressed as a superhero, I found both engaging and amusing. While his thought process is not something I pretend to understand, the situations he finds himself in as a typical high schooler were somewhat relatable, and they got a chuckle or two out of me. But then we meet eleven-year-old Mindy Macready (Chlo? Grace Moretz) and her father (Nicholas Cage); they stand in an empty lot, her wearing a bulletproof vest, him pointing a gun at her, all in an effort to train her as a crime fighter. He fires his gun, and that's when the movie stopped being funny for me. But it isn't until she kills someone that I finally realized how deplorable it was.<br /><br />A killjoy, am I? You'll forgive if I'm not entertained by the sight of a kid murdering people, or of a kid being beaten within an inch of her life by big, mean men with guns. And I'm even less thrilled with the idea of a father training his child to be a ruthless vigilante, as if he were doing no more than showing her how to ride a bike. Yes, I know it's all done stylistically, that it doesn't represent reality, that the whole thing is supposed to be a satire on society and violence and today's internet culture, and yadda yadda yadda. But there does come a point when enough is enough. If I'm failing to see the genius in "Kick-Ass," that's fine by me, because I truly don't want to understand or even inhabit a world where underage carnage qualifies as something to be laughed at.<br /><br />But before I go too far with this, let me take a moment to discuss the film's first ten minutes, at which point I still had hope it would work. We meet teenager Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), an unremarkable comic book reader who notes that, while just about everyone tries to be like their favorite celebrity, few try to be like a superhero. Of course, no one could ever be Superman, for he possesses extraterrestrial powers that exist only in the imagination - the ability to fly, superhuman strength, x-ray vision, etc. But what about someone like Batman, who has no superpowers? True, he's ultra rich and has access to high tech equipment, but he's still fallible. When Dave is mugged and a bystander fails to intervene, he decides to stop wondering and start acting; he dons a mail order green scuba suit and mask and adopts the alter ego Kick-Ass, New York's newest crime fighter.<br /><br />His attempts at preventing any kind of crime are disastrous, although he quickly becomes a sensation thanks to websites like YouTube and Myspace. This, I can buy: In Western society, anyone can have a taste of fame, even if that person happens to be incredibly untalented. But that's where the satire stops. In due time, Dave crosses paths with Mindy and her father, who dress in flashy superhero suits have adopted the monikers Hit Girl and Big Daddy; both are so skilled at what they do that they seem like ... I was going to say genuine superheroes, but that isn't quite true since all the good ones have never resorted to shooting, stabbing, or throat slitting. However, their knowledge of martial arts is second to none, and so is their ability to jump across long distances and off tall buildings. In other words, they don't seem like ordinary people trying to be superheroes, so the film's premise is now null and void.<br /><br />There's also a subplot involving Big Daddy's target: Crime boss Frank D'Amico (Erik Strong), whose son (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), somehow ends up as a patsy named Red Mist, created with the sole intent of luring in Kick-Ass and taking him down. All this could have been halfway entertaining if only it weren't so intertwined with the story of Hit Girl, who at one point finds herself running down a hallway in slow motion, singlehandedly blowing away an entire squad of well-armed hitmen in a blaze of bullets and blood. Had this not involved an eleven-year-old, I might have gotten into the scene's choreography, which, I must admit, is quite impressive. Alas, I'm watching a girl who hasn't even entered puberty relentlessly killing people, something I wouldn't even want to try to enjoy.<br /><br />If this truly is an accurate commentary on today's media-obsessed youth culture, and if we're still at a point when mass audiences find this kind of stuff entertaining, then I'm sorry to say we still have a long, long way to go. Under no circumstances should we be laughing at extreme comic book violence involving children, not at a time when we're saturated with news stories about youth gangs and classroom shootings. "Kick-Ass" is a grave miscalculation, not only because of its content, but also because of the belief that it's a harmless, escapist action film. The more I think about the audiences that laughed from beginning to end, the sadder I get. Is it no longer fun to watch kids being ... well, kids?</p></br><a href="../users/A2BFIYZYNK54QX.html">A2BFIYZYNK54QX</a><br/><p>Yes, the film/book is decidedly and wonderfully non-PC. Yes, Matthew Vaughn has a distinct visual style and has a sense of humor when it comes to musical cues. Yes, Chloe Moretz is great as Mindy/Hit-Girl. And yes, you can make a successful film based on a comic without sticking straight-up to the source material.<br /><br />But here's the problem. KICK-ASS (at least this volume) is a limited series. When you have decades of mythology, you can play with that a little and still make a great film (SUPERMAN 1 and 2, The Nolan BATMAN films, the first 2 X-MEN films, the first 2 SPIDER-MAN films... and more). But when you have a mini-series, like WATCHMEN, V FOR VENDETTA, LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, FROM HELL (basically anything adapted from an Alan Moore original work)... and you screw around with the plot, characters, and the moments that make those comics transcendental of the four-color genre, you lose most of, if not ALL of the things that make those titles great... which all of those afore-mentioned films did. KICK-ASS, as a comic, lasted for eight issues and those eight issues were great fun. It didn't take itself terribly seriously, and it made you laugh at its extremes. But it worked. There was no futuristic technology, no powers... just people with tazers, clubs, guns and swords. And that was it.<br /><br />Now, as we follow Dave Lizewski on his journey to become the first fanboy-turned-superhero, we're intrigued and amused at how much he sucks at fighting crime. Then when he does something sort of right, his antics are caught on YouTube and masked heroes become a sensation. Satiricially, this is a brilliant setup.<br /><br />But then the filmmakers, and to some extent, the original writer Mark Millar himself, decided to screw around with this story, and add, change, or remove  elements that took away from some of the things that made the book great.<br /><br />And I was lost. I couldn't for the life of me understand why this film decided to stray from the source material so heavily in three major moments: The actual origin of Big Daddy (which is VERY different in the book), the "love" story between Dave and his crush, and the finale. Well, one particular moment in the finale that COMPLETELY took me out of the film and just made me shake my head in disappointment. Hint: it involves technology that does NOT exist in our real world.<br /><br />And Christopher Mintz-Plasse? Trying tooooooo hard. And I'm just so tired of Nicolas Cage. He should have retired after he won his Oscar, because he hasn't turned in anything vaguely resembling a good performance since then, with the exception of FACE/OFF.<br /><br />These were all things that hit me after the credits for the film rolled and I was on my way out to the parking lot, but they were major differences that were done for purely stylistic purposes, and did nothing but hurt the chances for this film to be everything it could have been.<br /><br />I try really hard not to be a purist, because I know that films can stand apart from their source material, but when you change things that work in the place of things that don't... that's when you really screw your film up. And that's what happened with KICK-ASS.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>I don't get out to the theater much, so when I saw the positive reviews for the film adaptation of Kick Ass back in April of 2010 I decided to give the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785134352">graphic novel</a> a try. First of all, it was a fun, very quick read, because it was heavy on the "graphic" and light on the "novel". Lot's of well-drawn, "graphic", colorful images with blood spurting everywhere (as well as other bodily fluids).<br /><br />Now it's very rare that I say what I am about to say and many of the book's fans, Mark Millar fans and just plain old folks that disagree will call me blasphemous, but....The movie adaptation of Kick Ass is better than the comic book; um, I mean book; er, I mean graphic novel. Oh sure, the movie takes some liberties over what was originally drawn out in print. In my opinion a good movie adaptation of a book needs only to be as good as or better than the original author's ideas, and Director Matthew Vaughn pulled this off flawlessly.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; the original story is mostly intact. Vaughn just takes the over the top, crazy-violent, captivating story of a teenager that dares to live out his dream of being a superhero to a new level in the film version. The story is very well written and flows superbly. Meet Dave Lizewski whose favorite pass-time is, you guessed it, comic books. Specifically, comic books with superheroes. And this kid's fantasy is, you guessed it, to be a superhero. So what do you think he does? (Okay, I'll stop saying "you guessed it" now.) He puts on a costume, calls himself Kick Ass, and he goes out looking for trouble. And he finds it.<br /><br />He also finds out that he's not alone in his fantasy world of kids gone superhero. Enter Hit Girl played by Chloe Moretz. Moretz's performance is a big part of what took Kick Ass from a 4-Star movie to a 5-Star movie for me. Moretz is no wimpy kid, and the girl she is in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG97G0">Diary of a Wimpy Kid</a> is nowhere to be found in Kick Ass. She slices, dices and she does it with a smile. Okay, yes, it sounds morbidly disturbed to praise an 11 year old for chopping up bad guys with such a seemingly pleasurable disposition. But, man, that one scene where she chops, then looks over at Kick Ass with that little girl, new front teeth smile as if to say, "check me out, wasn't that cool," only to repeat the same action a few more times unflappably just won me over.<br /><br />And the rest of the cast turn in A-List performances as well. Not just Aaron Johnson who plays Lizewski/Kick Ass, but the whole doggone cast...including Nicolas Cage as Big Daddy. Cage ain't no <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OVLBIU">Ghost Rider</a> in this movie; he's a quirky, washed up cop that's out for revenge against a mobster who framed him in a former life, and Cage plays the role perfectly. While the character of Big Daddy is a bit different from the tough guy character in the book, it takes nothing from the story and I think that only a preservationist could disagree.<br /><br />Like I said earlier, the story is deliberately over the top and even pretty believable up until some of our heroes start to develop super strength in some situations...perhaps not super strength, but maybe super-resilient powers is a better way to put it. But the great acting, directing and flawless execution of every scene made up for any of the silliness that wasn't designed to be silly.<br /><br />This one goes on my shelf right next to some of my other favorite cult classic movies. If you're already a fan too and you haven't heard, there's a Kick Ass 2 planned for 2012, but I'd predict that topping the original will be about as successful as topping...well...you try to name a cult classic sequel that has ever outdone itself. I couldn't think of one.</p></br><a href="../users/AS558SNWF1DXG.html">AS558SNWF1DXG</a><br/><p>So in what world is it *not* a monstrous notion for a father to train his 11-year-old daughter to be a mass murderer? In the world of "Kick-Ass," of course.<br /><br />I don't shy away from violent movies at all, at least as long as the violence carries some sense of satire, irony, justice or is just flat-out entertaining.<br /><br />But even in the glossiest, most colorful fiction, I just can't get behind the idea of a child, led by a parent, to kill dozens of others in the blood-thirstiest ways available. Especially when those actions are presented as heroic, noble and occasionally bunny-cute. To add insult to countless injuries, the filmmakers' calculated desire to seem audacious and spark controversy is completely transparent.<br /><br />That isn't the least of the film's problems, but it's a large one among many. The film also has a dull lead character, seriously sloppy cinematography and too many confused ideas about what it's trying to say. Half the time it wants to subvert the superhero mythology, the rest of the time it exemplifies the genre at its worst.<br /><br />There's also an eager, trying-way-too-hard masochism to the brutality that reminded me of another recent bad movie, "Wanted." Which, coincidentally, was also by comic book writer and artist Mark Millar, and which also casually tossed around the notion that if a geek wants to leave behind the life of a loser, he only has to get a gun and start shooting. Bad idea jeans.<br /><br />p.s. I'm willing to bet people who drop negative votes on this review either didn't read the whole thing, didn't understand it, haven't seen enough movies, are 12 years old or all of the above.</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>I really wanted to like KICK-ASS.  The premise and the apparent message of ordinary people standing up to villains and crime and making a difference was very, very appealing.  But honestly, the only reason to watch KICK-ASS is the 3 fight scenes with the little girl. That's it. End of story. Of course, they are very violent and bloody, so if you can't imagine watching an 11-year-old girl stab, shoot, and slice the legs off of countless thug-types who deserve it, then there's no reason for you to watch KICK-ASS.<br /><br />But let's say you've been tricked into seeing KICK-ASS or someone has threatened to post unflattering photos of you and your hamster on Facebook if you don't watch the entire flick.  So you're sitting there in an empty theater and what do you see? Well, for the first 30 minutes, you DO NOT see any superhero stuff. No, you see pointless drivel about how hard it is to be a nerdy teenager. You get to see the main character's masturbatory fantasies (literally and graphically). And you wonder how this schmuck could afford a $99 wet suit. Finally, right around the 30 minute mark, he dons his wet suit, gets beaten to a bloody pulp, and sent to the hospital where everyone believes he's gay. So now, not only is he a nerdy teen, he's a faux gay nerdy teen.<br /><br />But I haven't mentioned the plot. Oh wait. For 33% of KICK-ASS, that IS the plot.  For the other 66%, it is a lot of gratuitous violence and gore.<br /><br />I was really disappointed in KICK-ASS.  It could have been a really good, positive movie.  But it degenerated into teen angst, gratuitous violence, and copious blood pretty quickly.  Yes, there are some funny moments, and yes, the ending is actually satisfying, but overall, KICK-ASS is just disturbing, and I won't recommend it to anyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>*** This review contains spoilers ***<br /><br />Kick-ass is the story of one Dave Lizewski, an 'ordinary', semi-nerdy high school student who can't understand why anyone in his age group never attempted to become a superhero in real life. You would think that such a premise has real comic possibilities but humorless director Matthew Vaughn decides to take things in a different direction. Right off the bat, Vaughn sets a nasty tone by serving up a mentally unbalanced young man, jumping off a building dressed in a superhero costume. The bad vibes are compounded when Lizewski's Mom drops dead of a aneurysm at the breakfast table. Fun stuff!!!<br /><br />The Act I set-up is full of the clich&eacute;s and stereotypes typical of many 'youth' movies of today. For example, there's the obligatory scene where a couple of thugs steal a cellphone and comic books belonging to the good guy high school students. Then there's the stereotypical antagonist, Frank D'Amico, a vulgar comic-book Mafioso whose goons kill two hapless drug dealers in two repetitious scenes that occur within about ten minutes of one another (in one scene, the goons chop off the guy's finger and then shoot him and in a more repulsive scene, a man bursts like a balloon in a giant microwave).<br /><br />Vaughn attempts to conjure up a modern-day 'Don Quixote' figure with his geeky Lizewski. The nerd courts his 'Dulcinea', the attractive but morally bankrupt Katie who's been dating a drug dealer. His first quest to prove himself to Katie fails miserably after he takes on the two thugs who had robbed him earlier and ends up getting stabbed in the stomach, then hit by a car and almost dies. Fortunately when found, he convinces the paramedics not to let anyone know he was wearing his Kick-ass costume; but the rumor gets out anyway that he was found naked and is now presumed to be gay by most students at the school (including Katie who befriends but also patronizes him as she also assumes he's gay).<br /><br />Kick-ass could have gone in a more clever direction by having Lizewski train hard in martial arts and actually become a truly competent 'superhero' in the vein of Bruce Wayne (aka Batman). But instead it's pure luck that he survives the gang fight which he attempts to break up on the streets and in so doing becomes an internet sensation on Youtube. Lizewski continues with his 'Man of La Mancha' act by paying Katie's boyfriend a visit and again naively attempts to intervene on her behalf. As it turns out, 'Big Daddy' and 'Hit-Girl' save the passive Kick-ass's ass!<br /><br />Now I have no problem with Damon Macready's story arc which involves the former cop attempting to take revenge on bad guy D'Amico after being framed. But what kind of message is being sent when he involves his ten year old daughter in his thirst for revenge? It's wholly inappropriate to depict a ten year old girl being trained by her father to become a professional assassin. Equally inappropriate is when teenager Chris D'Amico aka Red Mist shoots Hit-Girl--what completely makes no sense at all is that Red Mist is upset when his father's thugs carry off his buddy Kick-ass but he has no guilt whatsoever in shooting a ten year old girl? One other thing: after Frank is dispatched, doesn't Chris realize his father is dead? Does he try to find out what happened to his father or does it even occur to him? The bottom line is that the teenager shows no emotions at all which is not in keeping with the character's earlier scenes where he displayed affection for his father.<br /><br />The stupidity of Vaughn's comic book world is further on display when Frank D'Amico mistakenly shoots the wrong Kick-ass in broad daylight. You would think that the head of an organized crime family would be smart enough to realize that there are plenty of people walking around the city in the Kick-ass costume after the character goes viral over the internet. As for Lizewski's revelation to Katie that he's actually Kick-ass--suddenly bad girl Katie is transformed into a saint and falls for him hook, line and sinker. But Lizewski gets rewarded for finally realizing that he was a dumb ass all along! Some hero!<br /><br />The Kick-ass finale is perhaps the most repulsive aspect of the film. Big Daddy and Kick-ass are tortured on live television and then when the networks refuse to show the gory feed, all the voyeurs run to their computers to watch the sorry spectacle online. Finally, Vaughn resurrects his sadistic ten year old after she's shot, who then proceeds to dispatch one Mafia goon after another, in one unspeakably violent scene after another.<br /><br />Somehow after seeing a film like this, I kind of feel that something should be done about our current child labor laws. Rather than having accolades heaped upon Director Vaughn, perhaps the best place for him would be a secure lock-up--criminal or psychiatric, take your pick.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q.html">A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q</a><br/><p>Kick Ass is not quite the movie I was expecting. After watching this pseudo-Superhero movie, I thought I had just watched my first Quentin Tarantino movie. With all the F-bombs and extreme violence, I will not recommend this movie for anything.<br /><br />Seriously, the characters say the "F" word about 100 times! That is enough to sicken me - for any movie.<br /><br />The violence and gore is over-the-top. Simply not needed. I don't care if this is based on a bloody graphic novel.<br /><br />This movie stars a bunch of no-namers who desire to be superheroes (you can tell by the cover of the DVD. I haven't read the graphic novel so I wasn't sure what to expect.<br /><br />The only -ONLY- redeeming value of this movie was the storyline of Nicolas Cage's character, Big Daddy. His superhero costume resembles Batman's and he even talks like Adam West's version of Batman.<br /><br />It was fun to see Cage beat up the bad guys.

Don't get me wrong, Iron Man 2 is a VERY close second, but "Kick-Ass" bests it simply because of its ability to be both serious and laugh at itself (not taking itself too seriously); in other words, what all Marvel movies try to do, but usually fail.<br /><br />In Alan Moore's masterpiece graphic novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401219268">Watchmen</a>, Hollis Mason (the original Nite Owl) stated that the reason people started dressing up as costumed crimefighters was because of the criminals dressing in themed costumes, hence the superhero was born. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GZ6QEC">The Dark Knight (+ BD Live) [Blu-ray</a>] film, Heath Ledger's Joker menacingly taunts Batman, stating: "Those mob fools want you gone so they can get back to the way things were. But I know the truth: there's no going back. You've changed things... forever." And from there, we know that Batman has inspired this new cache of supervillains in his world. Well, it's with that same inspiration that a lonely teenager Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) asks, "How come nobody's ever tried to be a superhero?" From there begins a realistic, violent-yet-comic story of his attempt to become just that: a superhero called Kick-Ass.<br /><br />What starts off as "Kick-Ass" just trying to clean up the streets becomes a tale of a scared kid who's in above his head as he tries to avoid getting caught in the crosshairs of every hitman's gun under the orders of a mob boss (Mark Strong). Fumbling his way through his crimefighting career, Lizewski crosses paths with Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and Hit-Girl (the EXCELLENT Chloe Moretz), other vigilante crimefighters who make him look like what he is: an amateur. Along the way, he also meets a friend (similar to James Franco's Harry Osborn in the Spider-Man films), Chris D'Amico (Superbad's Christopher Mintz-Plasse), and further develops his crush on Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy Fonseca).<br /><br />There's been plenty of criticism about the film since it's release having to do with the supposed insult of Lizewski's dad being afraid that his son was gay; because that would be such a bad thing for a father to have to face (and yes, I'm being sarcastic with that statement). And the idea of Chloe Moretz's Hit-Girl being seen as a sex symbol as some moviegoers repeat a statement one of the characters, seeing her in action, declares, "I think I'm in love with her!" The "gay controversy" was reported by Entertainment Weekly. First of all, let's get this straightened out, Lizewski's dad in the film is scared by the idea that his son was prostituting himself, stripped naked and robbed ... not the mere fact that he was gay. Second, there will be boys who find Hit-Girl's dominating action as a turn-on, and that is disturbing, given her age (11-years-old). But, being as I'm not someone who views that as "hot," but rather just as really cool, that aspect therefore doesn't enter my mind and doesn't affect the quality of the movie in the slightest. To all the naysayers, I say, "Lighten up." It's a film about a kid who poses as a superhero. It's to be taken with a grain of salt. Besides, would there be so much "controversy" if it were a boy who was kicking ass and shooting guns and cussing like a sailor? Also, in a world where there are very few young female crimefighters, Hit-Girl -- despite her age -- could be seen as a role model. She's tough, independent and completely confident. But more on her in a second.<br /><br />Nevertheless, there are true themes of morality that pepper the story of Kick-Ass. The ever-present theme of "With great power, comes great responsibility" is tackled in various incarnations throughout. Let's revisit Hit-Girl and her double life. Damon Macready/Big Daddy's (Cage) quest for revenge on the death of his wife and the pathologically violent path it's taken his daughter Mindy Macready (Moretz) down is explored with great depth, as is the hazard of posing as a crimefighter/policeman/detective/etc. in a job that is extremely dangerous. The violence is plentiful and stylized as much as it is brutal and unforgiving. The question of a little girl crimefighter/vigilante is not "Does she have the right?" but rather is, "Should a little girl of eleven-years-old be subjected to such violence?" Well, first of all, again, it's a movie based on a comic book so it's whatever the writers want it to be. Secondly, if this were the real world (and being a father of two daughters), then no, she shouldn't be raised in such a matter. And the end of the film comes up with a way to address this issue. Either way, with the movies Moretz has been involved with (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UV4XUQ">(500) Days of Summer [Blu-ray] with Digital Copy</a> and the upcoming U.S. remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MYIXAW">Let the Right One In [Blu-ray</a>] entitled "Let Me In"), she shows great potential as an actress.<br /><br />Overall, "Kick-Ass" is a fun film! It's got very adult situations (violence, language and a quicky sex scene thrown in for good measure), but from its dark humor beginning to its sequel-potential ending, Matthew Vaughn's adaptation of Mark Millar's (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1582404976">Wanted</a>) comic hits all the right chords. I was skeptical about Mintz-Plasse's portrayal of Red Mist, but he surprisingly played the part convincingly and believably. For fans of the comic who read the comic before seeing the movie (as I did), there are slight differences near the end -- that I can only think for the reason of satisfying the moviegoing masses -- that were changed. However, these changes don't greatly alter the quality of the story. It's been said there will already be a sequel based on Millar's second half of the comic series tentatively called "Balls to the Wall." Unfortunately, Millar won't be releasing that series for at least another year or so. Until then, the DVD release of "Kick-Ass" will have to suffice!</p></br><a href="../users/A2OU415LB9I5J6.html">A2OU415LB9I5J6</a><br/><p>Dave Linewski (Aaron Johnson) is your everyday average 17 year old nerd. Girls don't notice him, thugs steal his money, him and his friends sit out around at comic book shops reading comics and talking about girls and why people never become superheroes. After getting fed up with the crime in his city, though, Dave decides to take matters into his own hands and becomes his own masked hero: Kick-Ass, and becomes a local web and news sensation. Things aren't as easy as they seem for a juvenile crime fighter as he soon finds out, luckily he makes friends in the form of Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage), a Batman-like vigilante, and his 11-year-old sidekick Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) who aren't adverse to the idea of literally taking out the scum of the earth. But when members of his crew start turning up dead, drug kingpin Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) puts a price on Kick-Ass's head.<br /><br />Mark Millar is an acclaimed comic writer best known for Wanted (which became the movie starring Angelina Jolie and James McAvoy) and his take on an alternate reality where Kal-El landed in the Soviet Union instead of America called Superman: Red Son. For Kick-Ass, Millar went back to conversations him and his brother had about becoming masked vigilantes, and took the conversation a step further and looked into what would actually happen if a teenager actually decided to take that step. As Millar got working on that comic, he also started working with Matthew Vaughn (director of Layer Cake, producer for Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrells) on some early ideas for Thor, but when Vaughn left Thor he started talking to Millar about his other comics. What started out as a plan to adapt American Jesus (Millar's sequel to the Bible) soon turned to conversations about Millar's still in the planning stage Kick-Ass.<br /><br />Kick-Ass is the anti-comic book comic book movie. It skewers the genre while also paying loving homage to them. It would be all to easy to say it's a spoof of the genre, because while at times it may poke fun at the genre (remember that scene in Spider-Man where Peter Parker runs across a rooftop and jumps to the next roof, there's a spoof of that) it still also takes it's place amongst it's comic book peers with all seriousness. Kick-Ass is a very dark movie, not afraid of withholding the violence that a choice of vigilante crime fighting will lead to, even if that means beating an 11-year-old girl. This is graciously offset by a lot of comedy, chances are if you're not cringing from people's limbs getting hacked off or their heads exploding (yes there is one scene where that actually does happen) you'll be laughing hysterically. Not to mention pointing out to yourself homages to other comic book iterations (the aforementioned rofftop run, Big Daddy's Adam West like cadence when talking in the suit, Kick-Ass in an alley staring up at a wall as if about to scale it like Peter Parker, etc.)<br /><br />The acting in the movie is phenomenal. Nicholas Cage hasn't been this good in years, and I was personally surprised to find out Aaron Johnson, who plays the title character, is actually a Brit. Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Superbad, Role Models) continues to surprise, considering most actors his age would have been typecast by a role like McLovin, and his arc actually did surprise having seen all of the trailers and promotional material for the movie prior to seeing the movie. The movie, though, is completely stolen by Chloe Moretz ((500) Days of Summer) as the foul mouthed, butt kicking 11-year-old Hit Girl. She plays the role with such force that you genuinely believe that full grown men, mafiosos, would be afraid of this 11-year-old girl.<br /><br />Naturally, this movie isn't for everyone, as we've seen from the brouhaha that's erupted for a little girl uttering the "C-word", but this is one movie I think it's rewarding to see below the surface. There's a certain hint of satire in it's brutality meeted out by a child, and a certain tone in the movie that chastises us for not being more involved in helping those around us, while also showing it's understanding of why we sometimes choose not to. I honestly can say that I can find nothing wrong with this movie, and I'm currently considering adding it to my top 10 all-time favorites list. I highly recommend that you give it a try!<br /><br />5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Somewhere, Mark Millar won't be rolling over in his grave. That's because 1) he's not dead, and 2) his comic book KICK-ASS gets the jawdropping cinematic treatment. I lost my mind a couple of times while watching this film, and I plan on catching this sucker again ASAP. With a movie title like it's got, it must've been problematic trying to promote and advertise this motion picture. But it's so wildly entertaining that I've no doubt word-of-mouth buzz alone will propel it to box office supremacy. It's the definition of a water cooler movie.<br /><br />Step up. Take a stand. Make a difference. Be a person of conviction. Put on a costume. Kick asss. I don't want to spill too many things, and this film has so many terrific moments, especially if you're a die-hard comic book guy like me, and it'd be too easy to drop a spoiler. The story has things to say about how comic books impact our culture, how today's near instantaneous forms of communication give us instant gratification and a wider scope of influence. Our central character, Dave, his legend spreads like a virus.<br /><br />"With no power comes no responsibility... except that wasn't true." Teenager Dave Lizewski says that later on in the film, but before that, at the start of the film, he and his loser pals are hanging out in a comic book shop and Dave wonders aloud why no one has ever tried to become a superhero in real life. Not too much later, he dons a colorful snorkeling suit (purchased on E-bay) and begins patrolling the city at night. Dave Lizewski has no special skills whatsoever. The first time he engages in a fight, he doesn't do too well, and this is probably more true to life than anything else that could've happened. And I guess Dave's super powers are good intentions and a certain undauntedness because he keeps on keeping on. His next skirmish, he becomes an overnight YouTube sensation.<br /><br />The first real-life "superhero," Dave inspires other costumed vigilantes, and it's around this point, when we're introduced to Damon and Mindy Macready, that we know we're seeing something off, something audacious and subversive and just friggin' cool. The Macreadys form a father-daughter crimefighting team called Big Daddy and Hit-Girl, and, unlike Dave, this pair is the real deal; they're the scourge of New York's criminal underworld. Nicolas Cage breaks his streak of stupendously horrid performances to deliver a fair bit of acting. Big Daddy has got issues. He's obsessed with taking down a New York crime lord (Mark Strong), and yet he also loves his adorable eleven-year-old daughter whom, by the way, he's trained to be an unstoppable killing machine from an early age. For her birthday, he gives her twin butterfly knives. That is some crazy, disturbed fatherly love. If nothing else, Cage as Big Daddy also occasionally launches into a pretty nifty homage to Adam West.<br /><br />Not that the film stays strictly faithful to its source. Little things were altered here and there, and two big plot elements were significantly altered, one referring to Dave's personal high school life, the other is in regards to a relevant side character. I can't say much more than that, other than I can sort of see why those changes were made for the film.<br /><br />Here, eat some adjectives: Irreverent, satiric, hilarious, profane, dysfunctional, and uber-violent, although not as violent or gory as Millar's comic book. This film is family friendly in the same way that Big Daddy demonstrates admirable parenting skills. The screenplay is sharp; the soundtrack fits the moments. The movie simultaneously lampoons and wallows in its comic book roots, and the opening scene sets the tone. The cast is great; the other actors do exceedingly well (British guy Aaron Johnson plays Dave Lizewski just right), but let's not fcuk around here, young Chloe Moretz steals this movie, and hers is the breakout character by far. Hit-Girl, eleven years old and gleefully ending people's lives with this big grin on her face, has to be, just has to be, one of the baddest, most lethal, most potty-mouth superheroes ever put to cinema. Sue me for being inappropriate, but all those just-mentioned qualities add up to one big ball of awesome. Hit-Girl is bananas.<br /><br />By the way, John Romita, Jr. also won't be rolling over in his grave, for the same reasons cited above.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus features include: a pretty dry but informative audio commentary by director Matthew Vaughn, "It's On! The Comic Book Origin of KICK-ASS" - a documentary nicely exploring KICK-ASS's comic book roots and including interviews with co-creators Mark Millar and John Romita, and Jr, inker Tom Palmer and colorist Dean White - and we also get to see the art process as it goes from pencils to inks to colors (00:20:34 minutes); the Art of KICK-ASS - still segments dedicated to Storyboards, Costumes, On-Set Photography, Production Design, and John Romita, Jr's Art for the film; and the marketing archive (comprised of the theatrical trailer, the profanity-laced Redband Hit Girl trailer, and promotional movie posters and images produced for the North American and International campaigns).</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>I haven't had so much fun watching a movie in years. Matthew Vaughn's very clever "Kick-Ass" has probably everything anyone would want in an action film: Comedy, Action, Love, really nefarious bad guys, Dumb moves, intrigue... everything! I couldn't possibly add anything, since it's all been said, but director Vaughn kept everything paced and centered, Aaron Johnson was endearing, Mark Strong is the meanest of bad guys, Christopher Mintz-Plass&eacute; showed that he can play more than McLovin, and Nicholas Cage was there, briefly, to keep some focus to the terrific subplot, and all involved were totally buying in to the insanity. Enough can't be said about the magnificent Chlo&eacute; Grace Moretz, an intuitive young actress who is a total natural, best in the film. This review may not be read, but I'm compelled to get in my 5-stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This movie is awesome. i hope they make another one the way they left it open for a sequel they should. this movie rocks.

It can be anything from a landmark moment in a characters past or a discovery of a power that no other mortal posesses. You know the history and all the iconic names that go along with those origins, but what if you were just an ordinary person who felt the need to just help the innocent and just go out there and kick some evil ass? Well that is pretty much what Kick-Ass did.<br /><br />Kick-Ass is the story of an average comic loving nerd that suddenly felt two things needed to be done. Evil needed to be punished and he needed to get laid. So after many attempts he finally became the green and yellow scuba suit wearing hero 'Kick-Ass' What he didn't count on was that being a super-hero wasn't going to be such a cake walk. On his journey he encounters others who are out there vanquishing evil and it is not such an easy job.<br /><br />'Kick-Ass' as much as I was anticipating to see this movie ended up surpasing my expectations. I had never seen a movie that was as hystercially funny turn into such a slap-happy over the top gore-fest with some extremly serious moments as well. it was as if Quinten Tarantino directed Superbad. The acting was amazing and every actor gave 110%. I also loved the fact that there was a female character that girls could admire...not neceserally look up to because well Chloe Mortez is only 13 years old. Still, this movie is incredible it has huge laughs mind blowing fight scenes and it just oozes with awesomeness. And hey, how many times and the success of a movie based on a graphic novel cause the authors of the first to write a sequel and base a sequel film on it?</p></br><a href="../users/A3QNQQKJTL76H0.html">A3QNQQKJTL76H0</a><br/><p>I'm a big fan of superhero movies. I loved the Chris Nolan Batman films, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB55H6">The Watchmen</a>, Iron Man, and the first 2 Spider-man films, but I didn't know anything about Kick-Ass when it came out in theaters. Only one of my friends had seen it, and I didn't hear any buzz about this film except the mainstream press criticizing it for its gratuitous violence. I was turned off by the ugly poster art and poor marketing, thinking it was some cheesy knock-off of the Watchmen.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong. Having just watched it, I can definitely say it's one of my favorite films of 2010. It's an entertaining and suspenseful action movie with lots of guns and tons of violence. It's an anti-hero movie. The main character, Dave, sucks at being a superhero. He's just an ordinary high school kid with a dumb green costume made out of a wetsuit he bought online. The only thing he has going is an extraordinary ability to get his ass beaten on a regular basis because of his gross lack of fighting skills. A third of the way into the film, he is saved from certain death by two real superheroes, Big Daddy and Hit Girl and their story arcs converge. Big Daddy (who dresses like Batman/Night Owl) and Hit Girl are father and daughter, two highly-skilled vigilantes out to settle a personal score with drug kingpin Frank D'Amico. Nick Cage, who I'm not normally fond of, I liked in this film as Big Daddy. 13 year old Chloe Moretz plays Hit Girl. She is both adorable and deadly. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is as annoying as ever.<br /><br />Visually, Kick-Ass is superb. It's stylish and super-violent in the same way that the Watchmen was violent and stylish (but not nearly as violent as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035V35PI">Ninja Assasin</a>). Lots of people die in fancy, inventively-choreographed and cleverly shot ways. There's a ridiculously over-the-top John Woo-styled clip reloading/gun catching sequence and a mini-gun/jet-pack at the end, but it's all in good fun. Gun geeks will also drool over all the hardware hanging in Big Daddy's safe room and the SMAW (shoulder-launched rocket). Lots of blood. Lots of stabbings. One guy even gets blown up in a microwave. If you don't like violence, stay far away from this movie.<br /><br />Story-wise, Kick-Ass shares many similarities with the Nolan Batman films, The Watchmen, Spider-man, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002O5M4SA">L&eacute;on: The Professional</a> in that the heroes are human and fallible. The film takes place in Brooklyn and other parts of New York City, but it's quite obvious from the locations that it was shot elsewhere (Toronto, Canada) for budgetary reasons.<br /><br />If you enjoyed any of the films I've mentioned in this review, you'll probably enjoy Kick-Ass too.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ST1XBL6EQTBV.html">A1ST1XBL6EQTBV</a><br/><p>The funny thing about how this movie got me is that my pre-teen nephews<br />were dying to go see it and begged me to take them when I had them<br />over one weekend! If it weren't for that, I would've surely skipped<br />over this one, but boy I'm glad I didn't now!  (-:<br />Of course, the whole premise, if you are a person who just breaks<br />everything down in logical and concrete terms and lack a sense of humor<br />will seem ridiculous to you. But this is one of these films where you<br />abandon all that and just take the journey with the story to a heightened reality.<br />Then you'll get completely swept up in it and you'll see what I mean when I say<br />that it's so ridiculous that you'll love it! (-:<br />It's funny, it's dark, their are poignant moments too...a very unique film.<br />I loved all the performances in this film...Nick Cage (Big Daddy),<br />Mark Strong, everybody!  Of course the girl superhero (Hit-Girl) does steal<br />many of the scenes in the film, but I liked KICKASS himself, Aaron Johnson, as well.<br />The awkward, otherwise nerdy outcast kid, who shows an inner strength<br />and inner beauty that inspires others in his community who would otherwise<br />mock him to find their own inner superheroes to effect change is the underlying<br />message of this film without being preachy about it.<br />The production, direction and story were all well done, but what would<br />you expect when you have Brad Pitt's PLAN B productions at the helm!<br />When I saw him showing up to promos and opening nights for this movie<br />on Entertainment Tonight, that should've been a tip off for me!<br />There's no way that a star of his stature would affiliate himself<br />with a project like this unless he thought it was good.<br />Like I said, give it a chance and it will get you!<br />KICKASS does just that!----Kicks ass! (-:</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Kick-Ass is based on Mark Millar's 2008 comic book of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785134352">the same name</a>.  The story is adapted for the screen by director and producer Matthew Vaughn.  The film comes off as a tongue-in-cheek cross between some of the big budget American comic book based films of recent years and live action anime.  The action scenes, just like the film's many colorful characters and its outstanding soundtrack, ask to be taken seriously enough to care for its characters, but in the end are appealing enough as fiction to provoke the audience to laugh, cheer, and generally stay exciting from beginning to end.  The theater I was in gave a hearty applause to Kick-Ass when it ended, and that was deserved.  After all, who doesn't like it when drug-dealers get taken out by likable underdogs that the audience can generally empathize with.<br /><br />Kick-Ass follows high school age David (Aaron Johnson), an every-teenager who wonders why real-life superheroes don't exist.  This reminds me of a fantastic special on the Science Channel about how Batman could be real, but his life expectancy would be incredibly short, so there's David's answer I suppose.  Anyway, so David settles on becoming a superhero without powers; just a green wetsuit, some batons, a taser, and later some much more heavy duty weapons that would make the US armed forces envious.  Obviously this is a film that asks for some suspension of disbelief but to say David's evolution into superherodome is a hard road is an understatement.  He does meet some very interesting fellow superhero's along the way including Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and his little eleven year old girl Mindy, or Hit Girl (Chlo? Grace Moretz).  Hit Girl brings the film's overall appeal to a whole other level and there is no doubt she will be a cult icon in years to come.  She curses at her opponents and then flips and dances around with her weapons in kind of a ballet of vengeance.  Legs are amputated, throats are slashed, and the back of heads are blown out all to the sound of the Dickies version of the Banana Splits Theme Song and Bad Reputation by, who else, the Hit Girls.  Finally, David meets fellow superhero newcomer Red Mist, who is complete with his own vehicle, the Mist Mobile.  Red Mist is played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse and is of course known most for his role as McLovin in the 2007 comedy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WZEZGI">Superbad</a>, but if he didn't shake off type-casting as a nerdy Live Action Role Player in the underrated 2008 comedy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OD4S50">Role Models</a>, then he has done so here as Red Mist.  Mark Strong, who made <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OQCV6A">Sherlock Holmes</a> a far better film as that film's antagonist, plays this film's antagonist Frank D'Amico, and does a fantastic job in taking his role just seriously enough. He's a great villain no matter the genre.<br /><br />Kick-Ass has perfectly timed humor to hopefully place the violence of the film's action scenes into a different lens for its audience.  It's not easy to defend violence in a movie that is clearly trying not to be taken seriously unless the violence is used as comedy itself, and here that can certainly be argued.  Firstly, in several ways, Kick-Ass is a movie about revenge so the violence has some emotional purpose, however flawed the characters may be for employing it.  Secondly, the violence comes off as a cross between Japanese animation and three stooges slaptick humor.  It is certainly a mix that made me laugh very much.  The humor in the film is also strong in its dialogue and the general actions of its unique characters.  The cast seems to get it and I have no doubt that Mark Millar, who wrote the original comic book, was working very closely with Matthew Vaughn in making this a pure effort with every single detail fully understood.  Everyone working on the film was very likely on the same page.  Highly recommended, especially to those who can really appreciate it, and to those who think it might be kind of a family film because one of its most visible characters is an eleven year old girl, think again.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>I gotta say that going to see Kick-Ass last night was one of the most surprising moviegoing experiences in a long time. The trailer made it look like your typical action comedy. That said the trailers still piqued my interest. When I went to go see it, I was totally unprepared for the dark, disturbing and violent, yet extremely hilarious ride that is Kick-Ass. So as you may see, the trailers were totally misleading... in a good way. It is a bit of a shame that this was a rather underwhelming box office result; but maybe it`ll boost next weekend due to all the good word of mouth.<br /><br />Kick-Ass is NOT your typical action comedy. It is NOT this year's Pineapple Express or Inglourious Basterds. Kick-Ass is a dark, twisted, violent and and brutal fun ride through a wannabe superhero, his love interest, a superhero who's dad is part of the Mob, a superhero daddy and his daughter, and a twisted plot involving the mob. It is also totally hilarious and has the usual teen movie formula with the love interest and the protagonist's geeky friends. Those mixed together form quite possibly the best movie I've seen this year!<br /><br />Dave is a geeky, young, teen boy. He has two geeky best friends he hangs with and is totally invisible to the girls. He always has wondered what it is like to be a superhero. But moreso, the question becomes: what is a superhero without superpowers? Batman doesn't have superpowers. One day, he finds a superhero costume online and orders it, and with it soon becomes the first actual superhero: Kick-Ass. One day after getting stabbed by a hoodlum, he gets tons of metal plates installed and now he has the chops to be a superhero!<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mindy (performed wonderfully by Chloe Meritz) and her daddy Damon (played by Nicolas Cage) live together and live in danger. He teaches Mindy to grow up early if the time comes where he dies and she has nobody to go to. However, they become superheroes themselves when hearing of Kick-Ass's fighting with gang members in a parking lot. As for the kid who's dad is in the mob, Chris? He becomes one too, Red Mist. But when the mob believe that Kick-Ass is killing all their members off, a war wages between the bunch and the mob, strapping the audience to their seats for one brutal and hilarious ride!<br /><br />As mentioned, Kick-Ass is just that: KICK-ASS!!!!! A stellar cast is combined with a great script and tons of brutal violence. Aaron Johnson does a great job as Dav, and does a great job at hiding his British accent. Nic Cage, someone I usually do not like is hilarious as well, his Adam West mannerisms are pure epic win in every sense. But the show stealer: Chloe Meritz!!!! She turns in a performance as tough-as-nails 12 year old Hit Girl. As for the violence, it's definitely not for the squeamish. There's a load of gore, and when the gory bits come you'll be shocked for sure. The torture scene is probably one of the most disturbing scenes I've seen in a long time too. Also you may find it shocking that a 12 year old is doing most of the killing!<br /><br />This movie is definitely not for kids under 15. It is indeed very violent and disturbing and they will probably find it disturbing too. But aside from that, this is an excellent movie that is a must-see this year! You'll NOT regret it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ.html">A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ</a><br/><p>If you initially thought (thanks to the trailers having to be approved for all audiences) that Kick-ass would be a potential Razzie-award winning spoof on the same level as Disaster Movie, Dance Flick, Meet the Spartans, and just about every *insert type of movie here* movie that is released nowdays (one word for those cinematic _____mongers: UGH), don't feel bad if you did.  I did too.  When I first saw the trailer for Kick-ass, my mind went along the lines of "why does the movie industry keep making these spoof movies!".  I really did think the movie would be another lame spoof movie or a half-@$$ed superhero comedy for children.<br /><br />Instead, what I got was a endlessly entertaining (the movie took no time to ramp up), violent, foul-mouthed comic joyride, both making fun of comic books and at the same time being a serious superhero movie (albeit with a zany Red Bull bend). I admit that it took me the R-Rating and an uncensored preview when realizing what it really was: A violent, often hilarious, and almost Tarantino-ish superhero flick, both serious, funny, and gloriously over the-top.  So much for first impressions.  It's much more than that, and It's certainly the movie I've been waiting for this year, considering how dire the year of 2010 has been for films (the new Scorsese movie was a two and a half hour rejected Twilight Zone episode, at best).<br /><br />A comparison that is already swirling around is a mixture of Spider-man and Kill Bill, and as my namesake probably suggests, it appeared to my Tarantino senses and delivered some thrilling action sequences.  The action is stylized in a way that would make the man himself very proud.  Most funny are the riffs on comic books, such as Dave's first attack that surely shows him why many people don't don costumes in the first place.  However, if you are a fan of superhero films, comic books, and take them seriously, don't worry, Kick-Ass doesn't spit on your past time, either.  Despite some of the satirical jokes regarding comic books in general, Kick-Ass is still a genuine superhero film at heart.  Kick-ass doesn't turn into a cynical satire with a "Superheroes are totally fake and your an idiot for getting into them" message.  The superheros are also internally motivated (Big Daddy and Hitgirl are both victims of murder), which helps the film seem more like a real superhero film, than just a satire on the world of comics.<br /><br />I'm sure Kick-Ass might get some criticism as being a movie that has nothing to offer besides shock-value.  As far as shock value goes, I wouldn't quite go for that, especially if you've seen such movies as Cannibal Holocaust, but this movie doesn't need shock value (ask Tom Green).  You'll laugh when it's funny, and be energized by the violence of the movie, not shocked by it.  That's the reason why it's great, it's more than just shock value, it's pure fun, like the rollercoaster type of feeling.  When we ride rollercoasters, we don't think of the negative emotions and how tough we will look, we think of how much pure fun were having.  That's how the R worthy content in this movie should be approached.<br /><br />Some of the humor falls flat, as I found some (SOME, people) of the raunchy humor to be kind of hackneyed, such as the scene in the beginning regarding self-stimulation.  It wasn't like Superbad, where most of the raunchy jokes were laugh out loud hilarious and quite creative, at least in my opinion.  They were thought out, not their for some cheap laughs.  Thankfully, these kind of jokes are kept to a minimum with great use of timing and swearing in the dialogue.  As you probably have heard by now, the 11 year old (at the time) Chloe Moertz steals the show here, as the violent 11 year old teenage girl with the mouth of a sailor and the maturity of a person much older than her age.  Another funny performance, well performances, I found were the mobsters, as their foul-mouthed, deliberately crude dialogue got a lot of laughs from me.  Lot's of the situations are funny as well, as I found the scene where they put the man in the trash compactor to be darkly hilarious.<br /><br />I for one am not a great fan of Superhero movies (some people really love them and get into the backstories and characters much more than I do.  They really do treat them like Greek Mythology), but I do enjoy them and I must say that Kick-Ass is one of the most enjoyable superhero films I've seen, much more than movies like X-men or Superman Returns (though I list those for personal preferences, I have nothing wrong with those movies).  You'll get your money worth, and you'll have a Kick-ass time (sorry).  This movie is sure to become a cult classic someday, and like most cult movies, it will hit home for the right kind of viewer.  Either way, don't miss Kick-Ass.</p></br></body></html>
